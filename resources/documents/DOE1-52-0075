Hatch Nuclear Power Plant.These high-speed, digital communications systems are used to link togethertwo data-collection nodes in each of two computer networks, so that theplant operating data may be shared on a real-time basis. The use of aglass-and-plastic fiber for data communications may have several advantagesover a metallic medium in this special application, and it has provento be a very reliable means of data linkage over several unit-years ofoperation.</TEXT></DOC>
