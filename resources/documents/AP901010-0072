(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Enrollment tripled at the OrtonSchool this fall, but there is no risk of overcrowding. Threestudents now share the school's single classroom.   ``Now I have someone to play with at recess,'' said Levi Tibbs,a fifth-grader who was the school's lone student last year.   His playmates are sisters Emily Hansen, a second grader, andSheri Davis, who is in sixth grade. Their attendance at the 1918schoolhouse has helped stave off its extinction.   ``We considered closing it, but if we did, then we'd have to payto board those kids in town or we'd have to pay mileage for them tobe driven to school and home every day,'' said county schoolSuperintendent Jerry Kleinsasser.   And that trip is no quick jaunt. The nearest town is FortPierre, a long hour's drive down 50 miles of bumpy, winding roadthat follows the rugged breaks of the Missouri River.   Locals call the area starkly beautiful. Outsiders call itdesolate. Winters are harsh and snowy on the Dakota prairie, andthe wind almost never stills.   ``You can hear the coyotes fighting and jabbering all nightlong,'' said teacher Steve Pickner, 31, who lives with his dog in arent-free mobile home on the school site. His nearest neighbors areantelope, grouse and rattlesnakes.   Pickner is in his first year as a teacher - he graduated fromthe University of South Dakota in August - and he has his qualms.   ``I'd rather teach 50 kids in one class than three in differentgrades,'' he said. ``That's 21 separate lessons I have to prepareeach night, but it does keep me busy and helps pass the time outhere.''   It's hard to get used to the quiet after classes. ``I lookforward to Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays when the mail comes,''Pickner said.   Occasionally, he helps mend fences at a nearby ranch that raisesone of the nation's largest private buffalo herds.   Elementary Principal Elsie Baye says teachers rarely stay morethan a year at Orton. ``It's isolated,'' she admits, and the freehousing is essential to lure teachers to such a rustic outpost.   Still, she persists in putting the best face on it: ``Someonewho is an artist or wildlife photographer would just love itthere.''   And as for the children, ``It's a great educational opportunity.Our rural kids are usually good students. They get a lot ofone-on-one.''   Levi Tibb's mother, Loretta, taught at the Orton School; herhusband, Wayne, and their three other children all went there.``They were almost a year ahead of other students when they got toninth grade,'' she said.   In Orton's classroom - big and bright with three desks in themiddle - two students sit together while Pickner tutors the thirdacross the room.   An outdated computer sits in one corner; a television set thatgets only one channel sits in another. The other classroom fixturesinclude an aging piano, an ant farm, a water fountain and amicrowave oven where the kids and teacher heat their lunches.   Once a month, a janitor shows up to shine the linoleum floor.Three times a day, the huge bell atop the freshly painted whitebuilding tolls.   The bell did not toll this year for the Orton School, but itsfuture is not assured. Stanley County rural schools once were full,but fewer ranch families live in the area, Mrs. Tibbs said.   ``They couldn't all make a living here anymore because milkingcows and a few acres of land just didn't cut it. People sold out toothers, and the remaining ranches got bigger. That cut down onfamilies and kids in the area,'' she said.   But Orton is not alone in its tininess. Of the three other ruralschools in Stanley County, none has more than eight students.   Almost one-fourth of the elementary schools in South Dakotastill have only one or two teachers. Legally, schools cannot beclosed unless enrollment slips to fewer than five. And neither thekids nor their parents seem inclined abandon the small schools.   ``It's funner than a big school,'' said Sheri Davis.</TEXT></DOC>
