The method controls theamount of a fuel mixture during open and closed loop; engine controloperation including the steps of: sensing a parameter related to thepercentage of the methanol fuel in the fuel mixture; determining thepercentage of the methanol fuel in the fuel mixture; determining a firststoichiometric air fuel ratio for the methanol fuel as a function ofthe energy content of the methanol fuel; determining a second stoichiometricair fuel ratio for the gasoline fuel as a function of the energy contentof the gasoline fuel; determining a third stoichiometric air fuel ratiofor the fuel mixture as a function of the first stoichiometric air fuelratio for the methanol fuel and the second stoichiometric air fuel ratiofor the gasoline fuel as a function of the energy content of the fuelmixture; generating an output signal for controlling air fuel ratio asa function of the third stoichiometric air fuel ratio; sensing a parameterrelated to the percentage of the methanol fuel in the fuel mixture includingmeasuring the index of refraction of the fuel mixture by an optical sensorpositioned in the fuel mixture and determining the frequency of an electricaloutput signal from the optical sensor; determining a third desired airfuel ratio including the step of interpolating between the first andsecond desired air fuel ratios for the methanol and gasoline fuels todetermine the third desired air fuel ratio for the fuel mixture; andwherein the step of interpolating includes maintaining the desired thirdratio of the air to the fuel mixture in accordance with the formula:desired third air fuel ratio = (6.4) (PM) + (14.64) (1-PM) wherein PM= (percentage of methanol)/100.</TEXT></DOC>
