IBM Corp., 3Com Corp. and UnisysCorp. are working to develop object-oriented, distributed-processing networkarchitectures, according to the Seybold Office Computing Group Inc. ofBoston.andM;* Artificial intelligence  Al) companies such as AlCorp.andP;  Inc., Aion Corp.andO;and Neuron Data are also seeking a toehold in object markets, based on theintimate relationship between Al languages and object-oriented concepts.andM;* Several specialized object-oriented companies have also appeared.andP;  ObjectDesign, Associative Design Technology, Object Databases Inc., ObjectivityInc., Object-Sciences Corp., Ontologic Inc., ParcPlace Systems, Servio Corp.andO;and The Whitewater Group Inc. are among those now involved with OODBS,languages and development environments.andM;* And some companies are introducing or preparing object-oriented productsfor vertical markets.andP;  For instance, the CASE arena has attracted Bull HNInformation Systems Inc., CASEworks Inc. and Index Technology Corp. Withinthe corporate world, the Brooklyn Union Gas Co. and Andersen Consultingrecently completed a customer-information system for the utility that makesuse of object-oriented design technology.andM;OODBs and the real worldandM;The power of OODBs lies in the way they bring together the basicdatabasemanagement characteristics of RDBMSes with the capabilities offeredby object-oriented programming.andM;* OODBS, like RDBMSes, offer data persistence-data maintains its existenceindependently of any applications that create or use it.andP;  Both databases arebuilt according to models, called schemas, that define the kinds ofinformation stored in the database.andP;  Data in an RDBMS schema are typicallyarranged by rows and columns in tables.andP;  An OODB schema is built aroundobjects and classes, among other parameters.andM;* OODBS, like RDBMSes, use queries to search for information in the database.andO;Transaction and concurrency controls are additional database elements thathelp maintain data consistency.andP;  For example, in banking, a typicaltransaction is moving money from one account to another.andP;  If anything goeswrong with the system before the transaction is completed, no change to thedatabase is recorded.andP;  Concurrency rules allow people to share datasimultaneously without interferring with each other.andM;* OODBs depart from traditional RDBMSes by using object-oriented programminglanguages to address certain limitations and inefficiencies inherent inrelational systems.andM;RDBMSes, for instance, store data in the form of character strings andnumbers.andP;  This model works well for personnel records, general-ledger systemsand other business applications based on numbers and characters.andP;  &quot;RDBMSeshave more substantial ability than 00DBs, for now, when it comes to accessinglarge, tabular, homogeneous pieces of information,&quot; says Burt Rubenstein,director of technical enhancements at Bull.andM;By contrast, OODBs come out ahead of RDBMSes when dealing with heterogeneous,complex data involved in complex relationships.andP;  For example, in an RDBMS,feet and inches have to be represented decimally by floatingpoint numbers.andO;It's not easy to think in such a format.andM;Moreover, &quot;RDBMSes get bent out of shape if you want them to store thingslike a 10M-byte image, 100M bytes of video or 15 seconds worth of voice,&quot;saysPaul Leach, Apollo Fellow at HP's Apollo Systems Division.andP;  &quot;These are datatypes that are too big and too varying in length among themselves totranslate easily into a tabular format.&quot;andM;Joe Forgione, DG's director of distributed-applications architecture, chimesin with the observation that, &quot;Most real-world information is in the form ofobjects.andP;  Objects are a more natural, intuitive way of structuringinformation than tables, especially when you're dealing with complex andmultimedia-based data.&quot; Duplication down, productivity upandM;It's also easier to develop, maintain and extend OODBs than RDBMSes.andP;  Forinstance, the object-oriented approach lets you build or modify complexapplications without necessarily starting each from scratch.andP;  One way is toreuse pieces of code stored as objects among applications that carry outsimilar tasks.andM;Still another technique takes advantage of the principle of inheritance tobuild whole new objects from the description of existing objects, explainsBull's Rubenstein.andP;  &quot;A generic account object in a financial database, forinstance, would have a person's name, address and account number that couldbe passed on to more specialized objects for checking and savings accounts,&quot;he says.andP;  &quot;Only relatively minor changes may be needed to define additionalobjects in this manner.&quot;andM;Benefits of using less code: lower development costs, higher programmingproductivity, more consistency across applications and greater ease inenhancing or extending databases.andP;  In time, &quot;It should be possible to puttogether application systems rapidly by purchasing object templates or shellsthat would handle standard business functions,&quot; says Hellenack of IDC.andP;  &quot;Youcould easily tailor such objects for your own needs.&quot;andM;Another OODB benefit: maintenance costs.andP;  RDBMS programs are written asmonolithic blocks of software, notes Chris Stone, president of the ObjectManagement Group Inc.: &quot;When you change one piece of the system, somethingelse is always affected.andP;  Altering a program can mean a maintenancenightmare.andM;But in an OODB, mail, file and print functions, for instance, are eachdeveloped as separate components, each with its own data procedures.andP;  If youwant to change a part of the mail element, you can do that without worryingabout breaking something else.&quot;andM;One other programming factor makes OODBs more efficient for complexapplications than RDBMSes.andP;  Much of the code required to access RDBMSes isdevoted to moving information back and forth between application memory andthe database, according to Jerry Katzke, vice president of softwaredevelopment at Index.andM;&quot;If you use a language like C+ +, a lot of that process becomes transparentbecause of the tight coupling between the data-implementation language andthe OODB,&quot; says Katzke.andP;  &quot;In an OODB, mapping automatically takes placebetween the storage of information in the space where you work on it and itsstorage in the database.&quot;andM;Katzke reports that Index intends to tie together C + + and the Ontosdatabase system from Ontologic in its next generation CASE product.andP;  Amongthe reasons for this move are the ease of program design and the reducedmaintenance afforded by object-oriented languages.andM;Dump those joinsandM;OODBs may also have an easier time than RDBMSes when searching for referencesamong sets of information.andP;  An RDBMS is good at locating relationshipsbetween pairs of tables, but it may take a lot of linkage operations, orjoins,&quot; to obtain the information you want if it is scattered among severaltables.andP;  Such a proposition can be expensive because the search program wouldhave to exhaustively examine each table, row by row, to find the relevantpoints of comparison.andP;  That chews up lots of computing time.andM;For example, &quot;Suppose you wanted to print a report that lists you, yourspouse and all your childrens' names,&quot; says Earl Eckland, product manager forintegration technology at Mentor Graphics Corp. &quot;A join request would takeyour name, go to the list of childrens' records and find all places whereyour name appears as the father.andP;  This operation would be repeated for yourspouse.andP;  Even after some children are found, you have to search the entirechildrens' table to make sure there are no more.andP;  You don't know you'refinished till you're finished.&quot;andM;An RDBMS technique called &quot;hash joins&quot; can improve this situation, addsEckland, by grouping rows together that are similar according to somefunction.andP;  But &quot;similar&quot; is not &quot;identical.&quot; Consequently, hash joins maygive you some information not relevant to your needs.andM;By contrast, an OODB can locate every object in the database in a unique andwell-defined manner by means of object identifiers.andP;  Related objects can bedirectly accessed as objects, without doing a join.andM;Eckland notes that this kind of capability is important in CAD.andP;  Inelectrical design work, for instance, you must verify design-data consistencyas a product moves through schematic editing, simulation and chip or boardlayout.andM;You can do this by examining the relationship between objects in thedatabases associated with each design phase.andP;  Thus, schematic and layoutobjects would be compared to make sure that pins and wires, for example, makecorresponding connections in a given product part.andM;&quot;We used an RDBMS for design activities for nine years,&quot; says Eckland.andP;  &quot;Butan RDBMS is not the right solution for CAD.andP;  We've now changed to an in-houseOODB system.&quot;andM;Distributed-processing networks, where information is shared amongworkgroups, are becoming important features of the database landscape.andP;  Someindustry observers see OODBs as a natural match for such the client-serverarchitectures on which they rest.andM;&quot;RDBMSes have been built on client-server systems, but that's not easy to dowell,&quot; contends Bob Martin, Ontologic's vice president of products andmarketing.andP;  One reason: Data goes into tables in an RDBMS.andP;  &quot;You have tofigure out how to partition the rows on tables in order to distributedifferent pieces of the information over a network,&quot; Martin says.andM;He continues: &quot;This can be complicated.andP;  What you really want to distributeis not, say, an employee's name from a table, but the set of relationshipslinking that employee to particular projects or documents.andP;  That calls for anobject-oriented approach.&quot;andM;Additionally, RDBMSes typically work best when centralized on one machine.andO;But Martin believes that can lead to performance bottlenecks in a networkthat lets multiple clients tap data residing on multiple servers.andM;On the other hand, DG's Forgione says, &quot;Objects, as self-contained, modularpieces of information, lend themselves to being distributed around networksand servers.&quot; But there is a price for such flexibility, he adds.andP;  &quot;You needan object directory that knows such things as which machines objects are on,who is using them and who is authorized to obtain which objects.andP;  The use ofnetworked OODBs can lead to potential problems unless the information iswell-managed.&quot;andM;Tracking objectsandM;Databases, of course, are not the only elements that can be represented asobjects on a network.andP;  So can devices like servers and routers.andP;  HP's Leachnotes that an object broker, as he calls it, could not only track thelocation of such objects, but help you find which ones you need to perform agiven task.andM;He says, &quot;An object broker could direct you to high-quality printers, orcolor printers, or printers not being heavily used, if that's what yourequire.andP;  We call such a system a client-broker object architecture.&quot;andM;Messages in an object-based network would be delivered by remote procedurecalls  (RPCS) and other communications methods.andP;  For instance, every RPC inthe Network Computing System (NCS) from HP's Apollo Systems Division carriesthe identifier of an object to which the call is projected and the name ofthe method to be invoked, according to Leach.andP;  In this way, anobject-oriented RPC could distinguish between, say, a batch queue and a printqueue represented as objects on the same machine.andP;  A traditional RPC dealingwith non-object queues could not figure out which was which.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
