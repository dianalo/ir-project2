 The phases also reflect whether a company isobtaining significant business benefits from its investment in PCtechnologies.andP;  When a company understands its place in the phases hierarchy,steps can be taken to move toward Phase IV, where a tenfold -- not 10 percent -- return on investment becomes the norm.&quot;andM;The first phase, Technical Proficiency, is that period during whichmicrocomputers begin to enter the organization and early adopters of thetechnology become proficient in its use.andP;  During this phase investment isbased on faith, and generally little effort is made to measure the benefits.andM;The second phase is characterized by investments which are aimed at taskautomation and individual productivity improvement, and the penetration ofmicrocomputers is heavier than in the earlier phase.andP;  Cost benefitjustification occurs at a &quot;micro level&quot; and is guided by a technology drivenvision, the return on investment may be as much as 10 to 20 per cent.andM;The &quot;Process Automation&quot; phase or Phase III occurs when there is recognitionthat the individuals within the company rarely work in isolation.andO;Microcomputers have begun to penetrate the business to a large degree andadditional investments are driven by a tactical business vision, directed atimproving the bottom line of a business unit of function through automationof entire processes.andP;  Some &quot;macro level&quot; benefits occur and three-foldreturns on investment may be obtained.andM;The final phase of the model, &quot;Business Transformation&quot;, occurs when desktopcomputing has fully penetrated the business.andP;  This phase typically involvesheavy investment in the infrastructure, encompassing a radical organizationalrestructuring.andP;  Investments are generally being driven by a strategicbusiness vision and the organization is positioned to use technology torestructure its current business process.andP;  In this environment the usercommunity is broad, influential, and experienced.andP;  Macro-level benefits often-fold return on investment may be obtained.andM;The length of time an organization requires to move from one phase to anotheris inconsistent and depends lamost entirely on the EUC vision and strategy.andO;Most of our praticipating organizations are in Phase II and a smallpercentage are in Phase III.andP;  The difficulty of moving into Phase IV, whichis where the maximum potential benefit is to be gained, is amplified if theorganization is operating with a self-limiting technology driven vision.andP;  Ashort-term focus impedes progress and encourages justification based onsingle projects or tasks, rather than on groups of activities or combinedprocesses.andM;The research undertaken by Peat Marwick and Nolan Norton into managementmeasures in end-user computing has exposed a number of issues, including:andM;* End-user Computing has a significant presence in many organizations with anoverall penetration rate of 20 per cent.andM;* Most organizations are still in the Task Automation phase of EUC evolution.andM;* Nearly half of the organizations enforce EUC standards through purchasing.andM;* Large volumes of EUC data are manually rekeyed from reports generated byexisting computer systems.andM;* Many EUC applications are still not seen to be critical to corporatesurvival despite increasing focus on backup and security procedures.andM;* Pressure to support more users with fewer support staff.andM;* User support and maintenance are seen to be the most important EUCactivities.andM;* Many &quot;hidden&quot; organizational costs need to be identified.andM;* EUC Support groups are too tactically oriented, and are not focusingsufficiently on the strategic issues of EUC.andM;* No structured benefits programs are in place.andM;* Hardware is nearly 45 per cent of the EUC budget, with an emphasis onconnectivity and local area networking.andM;* Support costs are underestimated, and training costs have stabilized.andM;* Expected return on investment for hardware, in half of the participatingorganizations, is one to three years.andM;* cost avoidance is still the biggest purchasing justification.andM;The most sought after objective for EUC is an improvement in useproductivity.andP;  Translation to bottom-line profit is also ranked high as anEUC goal, although this appears to be from a corporate perspective sinceimprovement to departmental budgets was ranked much lower.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
