Bulkeley (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> WANB </CO><IN> EDP </IN><DATELINE> LOWELL, Mass.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wang Laboratories Inc. plans to introduce an innovative personal computer system tomorrow that lets &quot;keyboard-phobic&quot; users put information on a computer screen by hand-writing on a digital tablet or by speaking into a telephone handset.    Some consultants who got advance looks at the product described the technology as &quot;dazzling&quot; and &quot;amazing,&quot; but they questioned whether many companies will pay the steep prices Wang plans to charge for the system's parts.    Frederick A. Wang, the company's president, said the Freestyle system marks the &quot;resurgence of Wang as a technological innovator.&quot;    Wang could use a lift. Consultants and analysts have increasingly viewed Wang as a faltering giant that mostly sells products to existing customers. After years of rapid growth, Wang's sales have flattened and profit margins have shrunk. In the year ended June 30, it had profit of $92.7 million, or 56 cents a share, on revenue of $3.07 billion.    Freestyle, which is targeted toward managers and professionals with an aversion to typing, works with any IBM-AT-compatible personal computer, including those made by Wang.    The basic system, which costs $1,995, includes a plastic tablet the size of a sheet of paper with a pen-like stylus attached. By moving the stylus across the tablet, a user can cause a dot to move across a screen to a picture of a mailbox and automatically retrieve any documents that have been sent by electronic mail. Then the user can write comments on them, sign them and send them to someone else.    If the computer is also equipped with a $1,495 voice interface card, the user can dictate comments. Stephen R. Levine, who headed Wang's design effort, recently demonstrated how one person could call a table of numbers from a cost proposal onto a screen and then circle key figures using the stylus and comment on them orally. Then he played it back, and as the pencil-like lines circled a figure on the screen, his voice came out of the computer repeating &quot;if we can hit this number we'll do it.&quot;    Amy Wohl, a Bala Cynwd, Pa.-based office systems consultant, said, &quot;A lot of customers will find this is a very satisfying level of technology.&quot; Scott McCready, a researcher with CAP International Inc., a market research firm in Norwell, Mass., said, &quot;As a desktop tool for management, it's as good as anything produced to date. It doesn't take anything to learn it.&quot;    To make the computer simple to use, Wang uses icons including a picture of a stapler to attach two different documents and a staple remover to take them apart. The user can even choose a screen that looks like lined or unlined paper. Mr. Levine said that some of the features are similar to those of an Apple Computer Inc. Macintosh, but that the stylus is easier to use than a mouse pointing device. &quot;Writing with a mouse is like writing with a potato,&quot; he said.    Sharon Matthews, Wang's product marketing manager, said Freestyle even appeals to Wang's founder and chairman, An Wang, who has always derided personal computers as too difficult to use: &quot;With this, he's a demo master. He keeps pulling people into his office to see it.&quot;    Despite Wang's enthusiasm, consultants are divided on how big the market will be for the product, which will be available in January. Robert Cameron, an analyst with Dataquest Inc. in Boxborough, Mass., said, &quot;If they stay with that price positioning, they'll shoot themselves in the foot. This is an opportunity they haven't had since word processing came out.&quot;    Harry Berkley, publisher of VS News, a Stamford, Conn., newsletter for Wang users, said that the product wouldn't be very useful unless it's placed on many desks in a network. &quot;Otherwise, you have to print out the documents with the marks on them. Most people just use post-it notes,&quot; he said.    But others predicted it would appeal to a larger market. Mr. McCready of CAP International said, &quot;In a large law firm where a senior partner bills at $2,000 a day, this is pretty cheap,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
