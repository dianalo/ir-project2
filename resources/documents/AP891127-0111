Appeal Should Answer Question</HEAD><DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When does a sea turtle egg become aturtle? That twist on the old chicken-egg debate is at the heart ofan appeal by a man convicted of poaching more than 1,000 sea turtleeggs.   Some species of sea turtles are endangered, so state law treatsoffenses against turtle life harshly.   James A. Bivens was found guilty in March, sentenced to 60 daysin jail and fined $500, plus $100 for each egg taken from the beachat John D. MacArthur Beach State Park on Singer Island, for a totalfine of $109,300.   Bivens' appeal claims the fine is illegal because state lawallows a judge to levy a $100 fine ``per unit of marine life.''   ``An egg, according to the facts of nature that an egg becomes alife when it is hatched ... is not a turtle,'' Bivens' lawyer wrotein court briefs. ``Hence the universal question: Which came first,the chicken or the egg?''   Oral arguments on the appeal are set for Jan. 18.   Prosecutors and wildlife officials say the argument is a new oneto them, but ridiculous nevertheless.   ``If you kill an egg, it's not going to become a turtle,obviously,'' said Barbara Schroeder, sea turtle recoverycoordinator for the state Department of Natural Resources.   But Bivens thinks the laws concerning turtles are too vague.   ``Just as a chicken is not an egg (and when one eats eggs forbreakfast, one is not eating chicken), a marine turtle is not aturtle until it comes out of its egg,'' Assistant Public DefenderLouis Carres wrote on Bivens' behalf.   ``Most of (the eggs) don't even turn into turtles,'' said thepublic defender, although he did not know what percentage of seaturtle eggs usually hatch.   Carres did not defend his client's motive, saying he was``probably up to no good'' when caught with the eggs and shouldhave been fined $500 for having them.</TEXT></DOC>
