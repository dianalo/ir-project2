Today's action proposes treatment standards and prohibition effectivedates for these wastes. Today's action also reproposes the prohibitioneffective dates for certain ``First Third'' wastes that were the subjectof a recent, related proposed rulemaking (53 FR 11742, April 8, 1988).EPA is proposing these changes based on data from the Agency's recentlyconducted survey of available alternative capacity at treatment, storage,disposal, and recycling facilities. In addition, the Agency is proposingto rescind the nationwide variance based on inadequate treatment capacitypromulgated for hazardous wastes containing halogenated organic compounds(other than soils), and for F001-F005 spent solvent wastes generated bygenerators of 100-1000 kilograms of hazardous waste per month and solventwastes resulting from Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensationand Liability Act (CERCLA) response actions or RCRA corrective actions.In actions not involving First Third wastes (or not exclusively involvingsuch wastes), EPA is proposing to amend the treatment standard for spentsolvent methylene chloride in wastewaters from the pharmaceutical industry.Also, EPA is proposing to require all hazardous waste derived productsthat are used in a manner constituting disposal and whose placement onthe land is exempt from regulation pursuant to 40 CFR 266.20(b) to meetany applicable treatment standard for each hazardous waste that they containas a condition of retaining that exemption. With respect to Californialist wastes containing halogenated organic compounds (HOCs), the Agencyis soliciting additional comment on an approach that would allow thesewastes to be burned in industrial boilers and furnaces in accordance withapplicable regulatory standards. Finally, EPA is making certain correctionsto the April 8, 1988 proposed rule and is including regulatory languageto andSection; 268.30(a) that was inadvertently omitted from the April 8,1988 proposal. If these proposed actions are finalized, these First Third wastes can beland disposed after the applicable effective dates if the respective treatmentstandards are met or if disposal occurs in units that satisfy the statutoryno migration standard (see 40 CFR 268.6).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments on this proposed rule must be submitted on or beforeJune 16, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The public must send an original and two copies oftheir comments to EPA RCRA Docket (S-205) (WH-562), U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.

The Statute The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA), enacted on November 8,1984, require the Agency to promulgate regulations that prohibit the landdisposal of untreated hazardous wastes, except in land disposal units thatsatisfy the ``no migration'' standard contained in RCRA sections 3004 (d),(e) and (g). Specifically, the amendments include dates when particulargroups of untreated hazardous wastes are prohibited from land disposalunless ``it has been demonstrated to the Administrator, to a reasonabledegree of certainty, that there will be no migration of hazardous constituentsfrom the disposal unit or injection zone for as long as the wastes remainhazardous'' (RCRA section 3004 (d)(1), (e)(1), (g)(5), 42 U.S.C. 6924 (d)(1),(e)(1), (g)(5)). Congress established a separate schedule for restrictingthe disposal by underground injection into deep injection wells of solvent-and dioxin-containing hazardous wastes and wastes referred to collectivelyas California list hazardous wastes (RCRA section 3004(f)(2), 42 U.S.C.6924(f)(2)). The amendments also require the Agency to set ``levels or methods of treatment,if any, which substantially diminish the toxicity of the waste or substantiallyreduce the likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from the wasteso that short-term and long-term threats to human health and the environmentare minimized'' (RCRA section 3004(m)(1), 42 U.S.C. 6924(m)(1)). Wastesthat meet treatment standards established by EPA are not prohibited andmay be land disposed. Although these prohibitions normally take effect immediately, the Agencyis authorized to grant national variances from statutory dates and case-by-caseextensions of effective dates. The Administrator may grant a national variancefrom a statutory date and establish a different date, not to exceed twoyears beyond the statutory deadline, based on ``the earliest date on whichadequate alternative treatment, recovery, or disposal capacity which protectshuman health and the environment will be available'' (RCRA section 3004(h)(2),42 U.S.C. 6924(h)(2)). The Administrator may grant a case-by-case extensionof an effective date for up to one year, renewable once for up to one additionalyear, when an applicant ``demonstrates that there is a binding contractualcommitment to construct or otherwise provide such alternative capacitybut due to circumstances beyond the control of such applicant such alternativecapacity cannot reasonably be made available by such effective date'' (RCRAsection 3004(h)(3), 42 U.S.C. 6924(h)(3)). In addition to restricting the land disposal of hazardous wastes, Congressalso restricted the treatment and storage of hazardous wastes. The statuteallows treatment of restricted wastes in surface impoundments which meetminimum technological requirements (certain exceptions are allowed). Treatmentin surface impoundments is permissible provided the treatment residuesthat do not meet the treatment standards, or applicable statutory prohibitionlevels where no treatment standards have been established, are ``removedfor subsequent management within one year of the entry of the waste intothe surface impoundment'' (RCRA section 3005(j)(11)(B), 42 U.S.C. 6925(j)(11)(B)).Storage of restricted wastes is prohibited unless ``such storage is solelyfor the purpose of the accumulation of such quantities of hazardous wasteas are necessary to facilitate proper recovery, treatment or disposal''(RCRA section 3004(j), 42 U.S.C. 6924(j)). <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Scheduled Wastes </ITAG>The amendments require the Agency to prepare a schedule, by November 8,1986, for restricting the land disposal of all hazardous wastes listedor identified as of November 8, 1984, in 40 CFR Part 261, excluding solvent-and dioxin-containing wastes covered under section 3004(e). The schedule,based on a ranking of the listed wastes that considers their intrinsichazard and their volume, is to ensure that prohibitions and treatment standardsare promulgated first for high volume hazardous wastes with high intrinsichazard before standards are set for low volume wastes with low intrinsichazard. The statute further requires that these determinations be madeby the following deadlines: (A) At least one-third of all listed hazardous wastes by August 8, 1988.(B) At least two-thirds of all listed hazardous wastes by June 8, 1989.(C) All remaining listed hazardous wastes and all hazardous wastes identifiedas of November 8, 1984, by one or more of the characteristics defined in40 CFR Part 261 by May 8, 1990. ``Soft hammer'' provisions specify that if EPA fails to set a treatmentstandard by the statutory deadline for any hazardous waste in the first-thirdor second-third of the schedule, the waste may continue to be disposedin a landfill or surface impoundment provided that (1) the unit is in compliancewith minimum technological requirements and (2) prior to disposal, thegenerator has certified to the Administrator that he has investigated theavailability of treatment capacity and has determined that disposal insuch landfill or surface impoundment is the only practical alternativeto treatment currently available to the generator. This restriction onthe use of landfills and surface impoundments applies until EPA sets atreatment standard for the waste or until May 8, 1990, whichever is sooner.Other forms of land disposal are not similarly restricted and may continueto be used for disposal of the untreated waste until EPA promulgates atreatment standard or until May 8, 1990, whichever is sooner. If the Agencyfails to set a treatment standard for any scheduled hazardous waste byMay 8, 1990, the waste is automatically prohibited from land disposal unlessthe waste is the subject of a successful ``no migration'' demonstration(RCRA section 3004(g)(6), 42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(6)). B. Regulatory Framework By way of preface, EPA notes that the following description of existingrules is for the readers' convenience, and is not intended to reopen anyof these rules for public comment. On November 7, 1986, EPA promulgated a final rule (51 FR 40572) establishingthe regulatory framework for implementing the land disposal restrictionsprogram. This rule also implemented the first phase of the program withregulations prohibiting the land disposal of solvent- and dioxin-containingwastes. Corrections to the November 7, 1986, rule were included in a June4, 1987, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (52 FR 21010) to clarify the Agency'sapproach to regulating restricted wastes. Some changes to the frameworkwere made in a July 8, 1987, final rule (52 FR 25760) that prohibited theland disposal of California list wastes. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Applicability </ITAG>The land disposal restrictions apply prospectively to the affected wastes.In other words, hazardous wastes land disposed after the applicable effectivedates are subject to the restrictions, but wastes land disposed prior tothe effective dates are not required to be removed or exhumed for treatment.Similarly, only surface impoundments receiving restricted wastes afterthe applicable deadline are subject to the restrictions on treatment insurface impoundments contained in andSection; 268.4 and 3005(j)(11). Also,the storage restrictions apply to wastes placed in storage after the effectivedates. If, however, hazardous wastes subject to the land disposal restrictionsare removed from either a storage or land disposal unit, or treated insurface impoundments after the applicable effective date, such wastes aresubject to the restrictions and treatment standards. For the purposes of the restrictions, land disposal includes, but is notlimited to, placement in a landfill, surface impoundment, waste pile, injectionwell, land treatment facility, salt dome or salt bed formation, or undergroundmine or cave (RCRA section 3004(k)). The Agency also considers placementin a concrete vault or bunker intended for disposal purposes to be landdisposal. The provisions of the land disposal restrictions program apply to wastesproduced by generators of greater than 1,000 kilograms of hazardous wasteas well as small quantity generators of 100 to 1,000 kilograms of hazardouswaste (or greater than l kilogram of acute hazardous waste) in a calendarmonth. However, wastes produced by small quantity generators of less than100 kilograms of hazardous waste (or less than 1 kilogram of acute hazardouswaste) per calendar month are conditionally exempt from RCRA, includingthe land disposal restrictions. The land disposal restrictions apply to both interim status and permittedfacilities. The requirements of the land disposal restrictions programsupersede 40 CFR 270.4(a), which currently provides that compliance witha RCRA permit constitutes compliance with Subtitle C of RCRA. Therefore,even though the requirements may not be specified in the permit conditions,all permitted facilities are subject to the restrictions. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Treatment Standards </ITAG>By each statutory deadline the Agency must establish the applicable treatmentstandards under 40 CFR Part 268 Subpart D for each restricted hazardouswaste. After the applicable effective dates, restricted wastes may be landdisposed in Subtitle C facilities if they meet the treatment standards.If EPA does not promulgate treatment standards by the statutory deadlines,such wastes are prohibited from land disposal with the exception of first-thirdand second-third ranked hazardous wastes. The first- and second-third wastesfor which EPA has not promulgated treatment standards can continue to bedisposed in landfills and surface impoundments, provided certain demonstrationsare made, and provided these units meet the minimum technology requirementsof section 3004(o), until May 8, 1990, or until EPA promulgates treatmentstandards, whichever is sooner. Other types of land disposal are not restricteduntil EPA promulgates treatment standards or until May 8, 1990, whicheveris earlier.A treatment standard is based on the performance of the best demonstratedavailable technology (BDAT) to treat the waste. EPA may establish treatmentstandards either as specific technologies or performance standards basedon the performance of BDAT technologies. Compliance with performance standardsmay be monitored by measuring the concentration level of the hazardousconstituents (or in some circumstances, indicator pollutants) in the waste,treatment residual, or in the extract of the waste or treatment residual.When treatment standards are set as performance levels, the regulated communitymay use any technology not otherwise prohibited (such as impermissibledilution) to treat the waste to meet the treatment standard. Treaters thusare not limited to only those technologies considered in determining thetreatment standard. However, when treatment standards are expressed asspecific technologies, such technologies must be employed. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. National Variances From the Effective Dates </ITAG>The Agency has the authority to grant national variances from the statutoryeffective dates, not to exceed two years, if there is insufficient alternativeprotective treatment, recovery or disposal capacity for the wastes (RCRAsection 3004(h)(2)). To make this determination EPA compares the nationallyavailable alternative treatment, recovery, or protective disposal capacityat permitted and interim status facilities which will be in operation bythe effective date with the quantity of restricted waste generated. Ifthere is a significant shortage of such capacity nationwide, EPA will establishan alternative effective date based on the earliest date such capacitywill be available. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Case-By-Case Extensions of the Effective Dates </ITAG>The Agency will consider granting up to a 1-year extension (renewable onlyonce) of a ban effective date on a case-by-case basis. The requirementsoutlined in 40 CFR 268.5 must be satisfied, including a demonstration thatadequate alternative treatment, recovery, or disposal capacity for thepetitioner's waste cannot reasonably be made available by the effectivedate due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control, and that thepetitioner has entered into a binding contractual commitment to constructor otherwise provide such capacity. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. ``No Migration'' Exemptions From the Restrictions </ITAG>EPA has the authority to allow the land disposal of a restricted hazardouswaste which does not meet the treatment standard provided that the petitionerdemonstrates that there will be no migration of hazardous constituentsfrom the disposal unit or injection zone for as long as the waste remainshazardous. 40 CFR 268.6. If a petition is granted, it can remain in effectfor no longer than ten years for disposal in interim status land disposalunits and for no longer than the term of the RCRA permit for disposal inpermitted units. 40 CFR 268.6(h) <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Variances From the Treatment Standards </ITAG>EPA established the variance from the treatment standard to account forthose wastes which are unable to be treated to meet the applicable treatmentstandards, even if well-designed and well-operated BDAT treatment systemsare used. 40 CFR 268.44. Petitions must demonstrate (among other things)that the waste is significantly different from the wastes evaluated byEPA in establishing the treatment standard and the waste cannot be treatedin compliance with the applicable treatment standard. This variance procedurecould result in the establishment of a new treatability group and correspondingtreatment standard that would apply to all wastes meeting the criteriaof the new waste treatability group. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Exemption for Treatment in Surface Impoundments </ITAG>Wastes that would otherwise be prohibited from one or more methods of landdisposal may be treated in a surface impoundment that meets certain technologicalrequirements (andSection; 268.4(a)(3)) as long as treatment residuals thatdo not meet the applicable treatment standard (or statutory prohibitionlevels where no treatment standards are established) are removed for subsequentmanagement within one year of entry into the impoundment and are not placedinto any other surface impoundment. The owner or operator of such an impoundmentmust certify to the Regional Administrator that the technical requirementshave been met and must also submit a copy of the waste analysis plan thathas been modified to provide for testing treatment residuals in accordancewith andSection; 268.4 requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Storage of Prohibited Wastes </ITAG>Storage of prohibited wastes is prohibited except where storage is solelyfor the purpose of accumulating sufficient quantities of wastes to facilitateproper treatment, recovery, or disposal. 40 CFR 268.50. A facility whichstores a prohibited waste for more than one year bears the burden of proofthat such storage is solely for this purpose. EPA bears the burden of proofif the Agency believes that storage of a restricted waste by a facilityfor up to one year is not necessary to facilitate proper treatment, recovery,or disposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Today's Proposed Rule </ITAG>A. Regulatory Approach On May 28, 1986, EPA published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(51 FR 19300) promulgating a schedule for prohibitingthe land disposal of hazardous wastes. This schedule is found in 40 CFR268.10 for so-called ``First Third'' wastes, 40 CFR 268.11 for ``SecondThird'' wastes, and 40 CFR 268.12 for ``Third Third'' wastes. In an April8, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (53 FR 11742) EPA proposed treatment standardsand effective dates for complying with the provisions of the land disposalrestrictions program applicable to certain First Third wastes. In addition,the Agency proposed an interpretation of the ``soft hammer'' provisionsof section 3004(g)(6) of RCRA, which allow disposal in a surface impoundmentor landfill of first- and second-third scheduled wastes for which EPA hasnot established treatment standards by the statutory deadline. Today'snotice proposes treatment standards and effective dates for additionalFirst Third wastes not addressed in the April 8, 1988 proposal. The proposed effective dates for prohibitions for these wastes are basedon a determination of available alternative capacity derived from a recentlyconducted survey of treatment, storage, disposal, and recycling facilities.In addition, the Agency is revising its proposal regarding effective datesfor the First Third wastes for which treatment standards were proposedin the April 8, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice based on the new capacity data derivedfrom this survey. The two notices do not propose treatment standards and effective datesfor all of the First Third wastes listed in 40 CFR 268.10. It was not possibleto develop and analyze treatment data for all of the First Third wasteswithin the time limits imposed by the statute. EPA intends to promulgateregulations prohibiting the land disposal of the wastes having proposedstandards and effective dates on August 8, 1988. All other wastes listedin 40 CFR 268.10 will be subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions of RCRAsection 3004(g)(6) (42 U.S.C. 6924 (g)(6)). The Agency's interpretationof these provisions will be codified in final form when EPA promulgatesthe First Third prohibitions as a final rule. B. Best Demonstrated Available Technologies (BDAT) This notice discusses the technologies the Agency considered in determiningproposed treatment standards for First Third wastes addressed in this proposal.Since the standards are expressed as performance levels of treatment determinedby performance of BDAT, any technology not otherwise prohibited (e.g.,impermissible dilution) may be used to meet these concentration-based treatmentstandards. The model BDAT technologies on which these performance standardsare based are summarized below. For F006 and K046 nonwastewaters, the BDAT performance standard is basedon stabilization; for F006 and K046 wastewaters, the standard is ``No LandDisposal''. For wastes K001 and K086 (solvent washes and sludges subcategory),the performance standard is based on incineration followed by stabilizationof nonwastewater residuals and chromium reduction followed by chemicalprecipitation for wastewater residuals. BDAT for nonwastewater forms ofK022 is based on fuel substitution followed by metals stabilization andmetals precipitation of scrubber water. Fuel substitution or incinerationis the basis for BDAT for K083. EPA is proposing rotary kiln incinerationas the basis for BDAT for K087 and is soliciting information to supporta conclusion that total recycling can be accomplished for some K087 subcategories.Proposed BDAT for K099 is based on chemical oxidation with chlorine. Theperformance achieved by incineration followed by metal stabilization ofash residues represents proposed treatment by BDAT for both K101 and K102.Treatment standards are based on thermal recovery for K106 nonwastewatersand sulfide precipitation followed by filtration for K106 wastewaters.``No Land Disposal'' is the proposed BDAT treatment standard for K021,K025, K060, K044, K045, and K047.EPA is also proposing to revise the performance standard for methylenechloride in F001-F005 wastewaters from the pharmaceutical industry to bebased on steam stripping. This would change the actual performance standardsfor these wastewaters in andSection; 268.41(a). Furthermore, EPA is solicitingadditional comment on an approach that would amend the andSection; 268.42(c)(2)treatment standards to allow burning of California list HOCs in industrialboilers and furnaces in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,xs72,r50 </C><T4>Basis for Treatment Standards </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[BDAT] </ITAG><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>BDAT</H1> F006: <ITAG tagnum="2">Nonwastewaters <D>Stabilization. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Wastewaters <D>[``No land disposal'']. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K001 <D>Rotary kiln incineration; stabilization (nonwastewater residuals); chemicalprecipitation (wastewater residuals). </D></ITAG>K022: <ITAG tagnum="2">Nonwastewaters <D>Fuel substitution; metals stabilization; metals precipitation of scrubberwater. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Wastewaters <D>[``No land disposal'']. </D></ITAG>K046: <ITAG tagnum="2">Nonwastewaters <D>Stabilization. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Wastewaters <D>[``No land disposal'']. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K083 <D>Liquid injection incineration or fuel substitution. </D></ITAG>K086 (solvent washes and sludges subcategory): <ITAG tagnum="2">Nonwastewaters <D>Incineration; stabilization of ash. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Wastewaters <D>Chromium reduction; chemical precipitation; filtration. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K087 <D>Rotary kiln incineration. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K099 <D>Chemical oxidation using chlorine. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K101 <D>Incineration; metal stabilization. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K102 <D>Incineration; metal stabilization. </D></ITAG>K106: <ITAG tagnum="2">Nonwastewater <D>Thermal recovery. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Wastewaters <D>Sulfide precipitation; filtration. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K021 <D>[``No land disposal'']. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K025 <D>[``No land disposal'']. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K060 <D>[``No land disposal'']. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K044 <D>[``No land disposal'']. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K045 <D>[``No land disposal'']. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K047 <D>[``No land disposal''].</D></ITAG></ITAG> C. Waste Analysis Requirements Today's proposed treatment standards are based on the concentration levelsof the hazardous constituents in the waste/treatment residual, the extractof the waste/treatment residual developed using the TCLP, or both the totalcomposition and the extract. Wastes for which destruction and/or removaltechnologies are BDAT would require a total composition analysis. Thesewastes are K001, K022, K086, K087, K099, K101, K102, K106, and methylenechloride in F001-F005 wastewaters from the pharmaceutical industry. Wastesfor which stabilization technologies are BDAT would require an extractanalysis. These wastes are F006 and K046. Proposed treatment standardsfor wastes requiring a total composition analysis are found in 40 CFR 268.43,and proposed treatment standards for wastes requiring an extract analysisare found in 40 CFR 268.41. D. National Variances from the Effective Date EPA is proposing to grant a two-year national variance from the August8, 1988, effective date of the land disposal restrictions for K106 wastes.The Agency is not proposing to grant a variance to wastes F006, K001, K022,K046, K083, K086, K087, K099, K101 and K102. We are proposing (consistentwith drafting in sections 268.30-268.32) that the proposed August 8, 1988,and August 8, 1990 effective dates be codified in andSection; 268.33 of theproposed regulations. In addition, today's action proposes to grant a two year variance fromthe applicable effective dates for certain contaminated soils that requiresolids incineration capacity. EPA is also proposing to change its proposeddecision (addressed in the April 8, 1988 notice) to grant a variance fromthe effective date to wastes K016, K018, K019, K020, K024, K030, and K037.Based on new data, it appears that there is adequate treatment capacityfor these wastes and therefore the prohibition effective date should beAugust 8, 1988. Among the wastes for which EPA will not set treatment standards by August8, 1988, are wastes K011, K013, and K014 resulting from production of acrylonitrile.Information received from the industry trade association states that currently,wastes K011 and K013 are all treated by filtering the wastes, undergroundinjecting the filtrate into deep injection wells, and burning the separatedsuspended matter. The industry association also notes that the producersof the wastes intend to file ``no migration'' petitions for continued undergroundinjection of these wastes. The Agency is preparing procedures to evaluate ``no migration'' petitionsfor underground injection wells. If the petitions are granted, the wastecould be injected into a ``no migration'' underground injection unit. Ifno (or insufficient) ``no migration'' petitions are granted, the Agencymay not have sufficient time to set treatment standards for the K011 andK013 filtrate by May 8, 1990, the date these wastes will be absolutelyprohibited from land disposal (except in ``no migration'' units). EPA is developing treatment standards, which will be promulgated afterAugust 8, 1988, for the separated suspended matter filtered from K011 andK013 wastes, and for K014 still bottoms; these wastes are currently beingburned, thus resulting in a residue that will be land disposed, at leastin some cases, in units that would not meet the ``no migration'' standard.These residues must therefore meet BDAT standards before they are landdisposed. E. Rescission of National Variances for Certain Solvents and CaliforniaList Wastes The Agency is proposing today to rescind parts of the November 7, 1986,nationwide variances from the prohibition effective date granted for solventsand the July 8, 1987 variances granted for HOCs. The wastes which wouldbe covered by this action are: (a) Spent solvent wastes identified as EPA Hazardous Wastes Nos. F001-F005generated by small quantity generators producing from 100-1,000 kilogramsof hazardous waste per month; (b) Solvent waste generated from section 104 or 106 response actions underCERCLA or any RCRA corrective action, except where the waste is contaminatedsoil or debris; and (c) Hazardous wastes containing HOCs in concentrations greater than orequal to 1,000 mg/l, except for California list HOC contaminated soils.Based on revised estimates of the treatment capacity available to treatthese wastes, EPA has determined that sufficient capacity exists to incinerateor thermally combust these wastes. The revised capacity estimates are discussedin section III.E. of this proposal. F. Corrections to the April 8, 1988 Proposal (53 FR 11742) Today's proposal also makes certain corrections to the April 8, 1988 proposal(53 FR 11742). Specifically, these corrections address the following errors:(1) Neglecting to propose regulatory language reflecting the Agency's approach,as currently regulated by andSection; 268.30(a)(3); (2) incorrectly identifyinga hazardous constituent in K103 and K104 (2,4-dinitrophenol) as 2,3-dinitrophenoland stating incorrect levels for aniline, nitrobenzene, and phenol in theregulatory text; (3) incorrectly stating the total composition treatmentstandard for toluene in K015 waste (0.148 mg/l) as 1.00 mg/l; (4) incorrectlyheading the wastewater treatment standard tables for K016 and K018 wastesas ``nonwastewater'', and the K051 tables in the preamble as ``K050'';(5) incorrectly stating the hazardous constituent tetrachloroethene astetrachloroethane in the preamble tables for K019 wastewaters and nonwastewatersand K020 nonwastewaters; (6) stating the incorrect treatment standard forhexachloroethane in K016 wastewater (preamble) and K030 wastewater (regulatorytext); and (7) neglecting to include chlorobenzene in the preamble tablefor K019 nonwastewater.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Approach for the First Third Wastes </ITAG>A. Determination of Treatability Groups and Development of BDAT TreatmentStandards <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Waste Treatability Groups </ITAG>For the First Third wastes, EPA used the individual listed waste codesas the starting point for developing waste treatability groups. In caseswhere EPA believed that wastes represented by different codes could betreated to similar concentrations using identical technologies, the Agencycombined the codes into one treatability group. EPA based its initial treatabilitygroup decisions primarily on whether the waste codes were generated bythe same or similar industries from similar processes. EPA believes thatsuch groupings can be made even with limited data because of the high likelihoodthat the waste characteristics which affect treatment performance willbe similar for these different waste codes. For example, two codes pertainingto wastes from the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals (K101 and K102)were combined into a single treatability group. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Demonstrated Treatment Technologies </ITAG>As discussed in EPA's promulgated methodology for determining BDAT (seeNovember 7, 1986, 51 FR 40572), a technology is considered to be demonstratedfor a particular waste if the technology currently is in commercial operationfor treatment of that waste or a similar waste. For some of the First Thirdwaste codes covered by today's proposal, EPA identified demonstrated technologieseither through review of literature discussing current waste treatmentpractices or on the basis of information provided by specific facilitiescurrently treating the waste or similar wastes. In cases where the Agency did not identify any facilities currently treatingwastes represented by a particular waste code, EPA identified demonstratedtechnologies in the following manner. The Agency first characterized eachwaste for those parameters which the Agency believes affect the selectionof applicable treatment technologies (including recycling). EPA then comparedthese parameters to other wastes for which these technologies are demonstrated.If the parameters were similar, the Agency considered the technology alsoto be demonstrated for the waste of interest. For example, EPA considersrotary kiln incineration a demonstrated technology for many waste codescontaining hazardous organic constituents, high total organic content,and high filterable solids, regardless of whether any facility is currentlyincinerating these wastes in a rotary kiln. The basis for this determinationis data found in literature, as well as data generated by EPA confirmingthe use of rotary kiln incineration on wastes having the above characteristics.EPA's rationale for determining demonstrated technologies for each wastetreatability group is explained in the section III.A.10. in this preamblewhich describes the waste-specific treatment standards. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Selection of Facilities for Engineering Visits and Sampling </ITAG>In those instances where additional data were needed to supplement theAgency's current knowledge of treatment performance on the demonstratedtechnologies, EPA arranged engineering visits to facilities that treatwastes with a demonstrated technology that potentially could be the basisfor the treatment standards. The purpose of the engineering visits wasto confirm that candidates for sampling, in fact, met EPA's criteria ofbeing well designed facilities and that the necessary sampling points wereaccessible. During the visit, EPA also would confirm that the facilityappeared to be well operated, although the actual operation that occursduring sampling is the basis for EPA's decisions regarding whether thesampling data represented the performance of a properly operated treatmentunit. In general, the Agency considers a well designed facility to be one thatcontains all the unit operations necessary to treat the various hazardousconstituents of the waste and any other nonhazardous materials in the wastethat may adversely affect treatment performance. For example, a waste containinghazardous metals and a high concentration of oil and grease would requireremoval of potentially nonhazardous oil and grease in order to facilitatethe subsequent removal of the hazardous metals by precipitation. EPA alsoplaces considerable emphasis on the levels of performance the system isdesigned to achieve in determining whether to sample a particular treatmentfacility, since the facility will seldom exceed the goals of its originaldesign. In addition to ensuring that a system is reasonably well designed, theengineering visit is designed to examine whether the facility has a measurableway of describing the operation of the treatment system during the timethe waste is being treated. For example, EPA may choose not to sample acontinuous treatment system for which an important design parameter cannotbe continuously recorded through the use of a strip chart. In continuoussystems, such instrumentation is important in determining whether the treatmentsystem was operating within the design requirements during the period inwhich the waste was being treated and the samples obtained. In addition to the design and operation of the treatment system, EPA alsobases its decision to sample a facility on whether the piping layout issuch that all samples necessary to evaluate treatment performance can becollected. If piping is not suitable or cannot be easily modified, EPAwould not perform a sampling visit. In order to select potential sites for sampling, EPA has established ahierarchy for conducting its engineering visits. The hierarchy is (1) generatorstreating single wastes on-site; (2) generators treating multiple wastestogether on-site; (3) commercial TSDFs; and (4) EPA in-house treatment.The basis of this hierarchy is founded on two major concepts: (1) EPA believes,to the extent possible, that it should try to develop treatment standardsfrom data produced by treatment facilities handling only a single waste;and (2) facilities that routinely treat a specific waste have had the bestopportunity to optimize design parameters. Although excellent treatmentcan occur at many facilities that are not high in this hierarchy, EPA hasadopted this approach to avoid, when possible, ambiguities related to themixing of wastes (particularly wastes from different treatability groups).Therefore, EPA prefers sampling from on-site treatment facilities wherethe waste of interest is treated alone or as a major component of the totalwaste handled. If such well designed on site facilities are not available,the Agency then looks to commercial treatment facilities where mixing ofmany wastes is generally practiced but where extensive optimization oftreatment may still have occurred. If no suitable TSDF facilities are identified,EPA conducts in-house tests and optimizes the process itself on a morelimited basis. EPA used a number of data bases to determine if any generators were treatingspecific wastes on-site or if there were any commercial TSDFs treatingthis waste. EPA's documentation for locating on-site generating facilitiesand/or commercial TSDFs for each waste can be found in the Docket for today'srulemaking. Although EPA's data bases provided potential sites of treatmentof individual wastes, the data bases provided no data that would preferentiallysupport the selection of one facility for sampling over another. In caseswhere several treatment sites appear to fall into the same level of thehierarchy, EPA selected sites for visits strictly on the basis of whatfacility could be visited most expeditiously and later sampled if justifiedby the engineering visit. A secondary consideration involved with the selection of technologies fortesting was the need to develop data within an ambitious statutory deadline.When selecting technologies to test for performance, these deadlines requiredthat EPA, in some cases, select demonstrated technologies for performancetests based on the Agency's technical judgement. This judgement consideredthe underlying principles of operation of the various technologies andany available data pertaining to the performance of these technologieson specific types of wastes. EPA's rationale for selecting a given technologyis presented by treatability group in Section III.A.10. of this preamble.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Hazardous Constituents Considered and Selected for Regulation (BDATList) </ITAG>The target list of hazardous constituents to be regulated for all wastecodes covered by today's rule is referred to by the Agency as the BDATList. This BDAT List is derived from a composite of 396 compounds and/orclasses of compounds that are presented in 40 CFR Part 261, Appendix VIIand Appendix VIII. This composite number includes compounds selected byEPA as representatives of some of the classes. EPA then identified 175of these 396 for which EPA could not perform an analysis of treatment performancedue to one of three reasons: (1) EPA does not presently have an analyticalmethod; (2) there are no analytical standards available for calibratingthe instruments; or (3) the analytical method requires the use of an extractionsolvent in which the compound would quickly dissociate (break down). Theremaining 221 compounds comprise the BDAT List. For certain treatability groups, the BDAT List was then shortened becauseit was unlikely that particular constituents would be present. EPA's rationalefor shortening the BDAT List for a given waste code or waste treatabilitygroup is presented in the Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) developed foreach Agency sampling visit. The SAP for each tested waste code can be foundin the On-site Engineering Reports in the Docket for today's rulemaking.The specific constituents that the Agency selected for regulation in eachtreatability group were, in general, those found in the untreated wastesat significant (i.e., treatable) concentrations. EPA does not propose toregulate constituents where data show that they would be effectively treatedby use of BDAT and through the regulation of other constituents (i.e.,treatment of the regulated constituent naturally results in treatment ofother constituents). EPA's rationale for the selection of regulated constituentscan be found in the BDAT background document for the treatability group(or waste code) in question. In some cases, control of indicator pollutants or parameters serves asa means of assuring proper treatment performance. EPA has documented inthe record when and why it has selected such indicator pollutants or parameters.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Compliance With Performance Standards </ITAG>All of the treatment standards proposed in today's rule reflect performanceachieved by the Best Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT). As such,compliance with these standards only requires that the treatment levelbe achieved prior to land disposal. It does not require the use of anyparticular treatment technology. While dilution of the waste as a meansto comply with the standard is prohibited, wastes that are generated insuch a way as to naturally meet the standard can be land disposed withouttreatment. With the exception of treatment standards that prohibit landdisposal, all treatment standards proposed today are expressed as a concentrationlevel. In today's rulemaking, EPA has used both total constituent concentrationand TCLP analyses of the treated waste as a measure of technology performance.EPA's rationale for when each of these analytical tests is used is explainedin the following discussion. For all organic constituents, EPA is basing the treatment standards onthe total constituent concentration found in the treated waste. EPA basedits decision on the fact that technologies exist to destroy the variousorganic compounds. Accordingly, the best measure of performance would bethe extent to which the various organic compounds have been destroyed orthe total amount of constituent remaining after treatment.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note</T4>._EPA's land disposal restrictions for solvent waste codesF001-F005 (51 FR 40572) uses the TCLP value as a measure of performance.At the time that EPA promulgated the treatment standards for F001-F005,useful data were not available on total constituent concentrations in treatedresiduals and, as a result, the TCLP data were considered to be the bestmeasure of performance.</ITAG>For inorganic constituents, EPA is using either total constituent concentration,the TCLP, or in some cases, both, as the basis for treatment standards.EPA is using total constituent concentrations when the technology basisincludes a metal recovery operation. The underlying principle of metalrecovery is the reduction of the amount of metal in a waste by separatingthe metal for recovery; therefore, total constituent concentration in thetreated residual is an important measure of performance for this technology.EPA also believes that it is important that any remaining metal in a treatedresidual waste not be in a state that is easily leachable; accordingly,EPA also is using the TCLP as a measure of performance. It is importantto note that, for wastes where treatment standards are based on a metalrecovery process, the waste has to meet both the total constituent concentrationand the TCLP concentration prior to land disposal. In cases where treatment standards for metals are not based on recoverytechniques but rather on stabilization, EPA is using the TCLP as the measureof the treatment technology's performance. The Agency's rationale is thatstabilization is not meant to reduce the concentration of metal in a wastebut only to chemically and physically minimize the mobility of the metalsin the waste. These are parameters measured by the TCLP protocol. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Identification of BDAT </ITAG>A detailed discussion of the Agency's general methodology for establishingBDAT standards is provided in 51 FR 40572 (November 7, 1986) and is notreopened for comment here. This section discusses the specific applicationof the methodology to the First Third wastes, and provides a summary ofsome of the principal elements of the BDAT methodology. As a first step in the development of BDAT treatment standards, EPA screenedthe available treatment data for a particular treatability group with regardto the design and operation of the system, the quality assurance/qualitycontrol analyses of the data, and the analytical tests used to assess treatmentperformance. This screening step is consistent with EPA's promulgated approachin the November 7, 1986, rulemaking for solvent waste codes F001-F005.Also, this screening step recognizes the fact that different performancemeasures may be appropriate depending on the technology used (i.e., totalconstituent analysis for incineration versus TCLP for stabilization) asdiscussed earlier. EPA was able to emphasize the design and operation ofthe treatment system for the First Third wastes because its field testshave been modified to gather detailed data to support these analyses. Asdiscussed earlier, the EPA field tests include data describing the operatingconditions of the treatment unit during the time that treatment sampleswere collected. After the initial screening test, EPA adjusted all treated data valuesbased on the analytical recovery obtained in order to take into accountanalytical interferences associated with the chemical makeup of the treatedsample. For example, a treated residual data point of 0.2 mg/kg with ananalytical recovery of 50 percent would be adjusted to 0.4 mg/kg. In developingrecovery data (also referred to as accuracy data), EPA would first analyzea waste for a constituent and then add a known amount of the same constituent(i.e., spike) to the waste material). The total amount recovered afterspiking minus the initial concentration in the sample divided by the amountadded is the recovery value. After adjusting the data, EPA then averaged the performance values forthe various treatment operations and compared the mean values using theanalysis of variance test (ANOVA), as described in the November 7, 1986,preamble (see 51 FR 40591), to determine if one technology performed significantlybetter. EPA's decisions regarding selection of one technology over anotherthat resulted from this methodology can be found in the ``Identificationof BDAT'' sections that follow for each treatability group. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. BDAT Treatment Standards for ``Derived-From'' and ``Mixed'' Wastes</ITAG>a. <T3>Applicability of BDAT to ``Derived-From'' Wastes from Treatment TrainsGenerating Multiple Residues.</T3> In a number of instances in this proposedrule, the proposed BDAT consists of an operation or series of treatmentoperations which generate additional waste residues. For example, the proposedBDAT treatment for wastes K101 and K102 is based on incineration followedby metals (ash) stabilization. Incineration generates two residues requiringtreatment, namely the ash residues and the scrubber waters. Treatment ofthe scrubber waters (to remove metals) may generate further additionalinorganic residues which also may require stabilization. Ultimately, theseadditional wastes may require land disposal and must, therefore, meet thesame standards as the stabilized ash residues. With respect to these additionalwastes, the Agency wishes to emphasize the following points: (1) All of the residues from treating the original listed wastes are likewiseconsidered to be the listed waste by virtue of the derived-from rule containedin 40 CFR 261.3(c)(2) (this point is discussed more fully in the subsectionbelow). Consequently, all of the wastes generated in the course of treatmentwould be prohibited from land disposal unless they satisfy the treatmentstandard or meet one of the exceptions to the prohibition. (2) The Agency's proposed treatment standards generally contain constituentconcentrations for ``wastewaters'' and constituent concentrations for ``nonwastewaters''.The treatment standards apply to all of the wastes generated in treatingthe original prohibited waste. Thus, for example, all solids generatedfrom treating K101 and K102 would typically have to meet the treatmentstandards for nonwastewaters and all wastewaters generated from treatingthese wastes would have to meet the treatment standards for wastewaters.(For the purposes of this rule, the Agency defines wastewaters as thosewastes, mixed wastes, or derived-from wastes that contain less than 1%total organic carbon (TOC) and less than 1% filterable solids. Those wastes,mixed wastes or derived-from wastes that do not meet this definition aredefined as nonwastewaters. A facility is not allowed to dilute or performpartial treatment on a waste in order to switch the applicability of anonwastewater standard to a wastewater standard or vice versa.) The Agency has not performed tests, in all cases, on every waste that canresult from every part of the treatment train. However, the Agency's treatmentstandards are based on treatment of the most concentrated form of the waste.Consequently, the Agency believes that the less concentrated wastes generatedin the course of treatment also will be able to be treated to meet thesestandards. b. <T3>Applicability of BDAT to Mixtures and Other ``Derived-From'' Residues.</T3>There is a further question as to the applicability of the BDAT treatmentlevels to residues generated not from treating the waste (as discussedabove), but generated instead from other types of management. Examplesare contaminated soil, or leachate that is derived from managing the waste.In these cases, the mixture is still deemed to be the listed waste, eitherbecause of the derived-from rule, the mixture rule (40 CFR 261.3(a)(2)(iv)),or because the listed waste is contained in the matrix (see, e.g., 40 CFR261.33(d)). The prohibition for the particular listed waste consequentlyapplies to this type of waste.The Agency believes that the majority of these types of residues can meetthe treatment standards for the underlying listed wastes (with the possibleexception of contaminated soil and debris for which the Agency is currentlyinvestigating whether it is appropriate to establish a separate treatabilitysubcategorization). For the most part, these residues will be less concentratedthan the original listed waste. By assuming that the values used to establishthe treatment standard exhibit a lognormal distribution, the Agency isallowing for a reasonable amount of process variability in the generationand treatment of the waste. The waste also might be amenable to a relativelynonvariable form of treatment technology such as incineration. Finally,and perhaps most important, the rules contain a treatment variance procedurethat allows a petitioner to demonstrate that its waste cannot be treatedto the level specified in the rule (40 CFR 268.44(a). This provision providesa safety valve that allows persons with unusual waste matrices to demonstratethe appropriateness of a different standard. The Agency notes that to dateit has not received any petitions under this provision (for example, forresidues contaminated with a prohibited solvent waste), indicating, inthe Agency's view, that the existing standards are generally achievable.c. <T3>Residues from Managing Listed Wastes, or that Contain Listed Wastes,are Covered by the Prohibitions for the Listed Waste. </T3>In responseto inquiries, EPA confirms its long-standing interpretation that residues(leachate, for example) that derive from treatment, storage, or disposalof wastes that were disposed before the effective date of the listing arenevertheless subject to the derived-from rule. These residues thereforecould become subject to the land disposal ban for the listed waste fromwhich they derive if they are managed actively after the effective dateof the land disposal prohibition for the underlying waste. This resultfollows from direct application of the regulations and the statute. First, hazardous waste listings are retroactive_that is, once a particularmaterial is identified as a hazardous waste, all of that material, no matterwhen disposed, is a listed hazardous waste (albeit, not subject to SubtitleC regulations if in an inactive unit, and not subject to the land ban ifdisposed of before the ban effective date and not removed or exhumed thereafter).See CERCLA section 103(c) (owners of inactive sites that handled hazardouswaste identified or listed by EPA, where the identification or listingoccurred after the site was closed, must still notify EPA of their existence);46 FR 22146, 22149 (April 15, 1981) (same); RCRA sections 3004(d)(3), 3004(e)(3),and 3020(b) (application of RCRA Subtitle C requirements to listed wastesand residues from CERCLA response actions, most of which involve wastesdisposed of before the listing date); 50 FR 1994 (Jan. 14, 1985) (listingof dioxin-containing waste applies to waste and residues like contaminatedsoil, disposed before the listing effective date_and before the SubtitleC regulation effective date). Second, residues derived-from treating, storing,or disposing (including leaking_see, <T3>e.g. </T3>RCRA section 1004(3) and <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Waste Industries, Inc., </T3>743 F.2d 159, 164 (4th Cir. 1983)), ofthese wastes are also hazardous by virtue of the derived-from rule. Thus, residues from managing First Third wastes, listed California listwastes, and spent solvents and dioxin wastes are all considered to be subjectto the prohibitions for the underlying hazardous wastes. As explained above,this result stems directly from the derived-from rule in 40 CFR 261.3(c)(2),or in some cases because the waste is mixed with or otherwise containsthe listed waste. The underlying principle stated in all of these provisionsis that listed wastes remain hazardous until they are delisted. Nor is there any argument that a residue from managing a listed waste isnot considered to be the listed waste. For example, the Agency's historicpractice in processing delisting petitions addressing mixed residuals hasbeen to consider them to be the listed waste and to require that delistingpetitioners address all constituents for which the original derived-fromwaste (or other mixed waste) was listed. The language in 40 CFR 260.22(b)states that mixtures or derived-from residues can be delisted provideda delisting petitioner makes the identical demonstration that a delistingpetitioner would make for the underlying waste. These residues consequentlyare treated as the underlying listed waste for delisting purposes. Thestatute likewise takes this position, indicating that soil and debris thatare contaminated with listed spent solvents or dioxin wastes are subjectto the prohibition for these wastes even though these wastes are not theoriginally generated waste, but rather are a residual from the waste'smanagement (RCRA section 3004(e)(3)). It is EPA's view that all such residuesare covered by the existing prohibitions and by the treatment standardsfor the listed hazardous waste that these residues contain and from whichthey are derived. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Transfer of Treatment Standards </ITAG>In today's notice, EPA is proposing some treatment standards that are notbased on testing of the treatment technology of the specific waste subjectto the treatment standard. Instead, the Agency determined that the constituentspresent in the waste can be treated to the same performance levels as observedin other wastes for which EPA has previously developed treatment data.EPA believes transferring treatment performance for use in establishingtreatment standards for untested wastes is valid technically in cases wherethe untested wastes are generated from similar industries or from similarprocessing steps. As explained earlier in this preamble, transfer of treatmentstandards to wastes from similar processing steps requires little formalanalysis because of the likelihood that similar production processes willproduce a waste matrix with similar characteristics. However, in the casewhere only the industry is similar, EPA more closely examines the wastecharacteristics prior to concluding that the untested waste constituentscan be treated to levels associated with tested wastes. EPA undertakes a two-step analysis when determining whether wastes generatedby different processes within a single industry can be treated to the samelevel of performance. First, EPA reviews the available waste characteristicdata for identifying those parameters which are expected to affect treatmentselection. EPA has identified some of the most important constituents andother parameters needed to select the treatment technology appropriatefor a given waste. A detailed discussion of each analysis, including howeach parameter was selected for each waste, can be found in the backgrounddocument for each waste. Second, when an individual analysis suggests that an untested waste canbe treated with the same technology as a waste for which treatment performancedata are already available, EPA then analyzes a more detailed list of constituentsthat represent some of the most important waste characteristics which theAgency believes will affect the performance of the technology. By examiningand comparing these characteristics, the Agency determines whether theuntested wastes will achieve the same level of treatment as the testedwaste. Where the Agency determines that the untested waste can be treatedas well as the tested waste, the treatment standards can be transferred.A detailed discussion of this transfer process for each waste and constituentcan be found in the BDAT background documents for each waste or waste treatabilitygroup.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. No Land Disposal as the BDAT Treatment Standard </ITAG>EPA is proposing ``no land disposal'' as BDAT for several of the FirstThird wastes. This standard is analogous to the no discharge standard establishedas Best Available Technology (BAT) under the Clean Water Act's effluentguideline program. It indicates that after examining available data, theAgency has identified that: (1) The waste can be totally recycled withoutgenerating a prohibited residue; (2) the waste is not currently being landdisposed; or (3) the waste is no longer being generated. An alternative to establishing no land disposal as BDAT would be to indicatethat the BDAT treatment standard is a concentration level of ``0'' forall hazardous constituents. This appears to the Agency to be a less desirableway to proceed, given that the analytical limit of detection is alwaysgreater than zero. Given that technologies exist that make land disposalunnecessary, and that ``0'' really means the analytic detection limit andnot truly zero, EPA thinks that specifying no land disposal as BDAT isa better way of expressing its intention. The Agency notes that it could simply allow the statutory prohibition totake effect (at least by May 8, 1990, the date of the absolute statutoryprohibition) to achieve the intended result of no land disposal. The drawbackwith this approach is that it allows no possibility of granting a variancefrom a treatment standard for those wastes that might not be amenable tothe BDAT treatment technology. In the absence of a treatment standard,a facility would have to initially petition the Agency to establish a treatmentstandard for the waste, a more cumbersome and time-consuming process thanapplying for a variance under 40 CFR 268.44. This approach would also allowthe waste to be land disposed until May 8, 1990, under the ``soft hammer''of section 3004(g)(6) of RCRA. Accordingly, the Agency believes the bestway to proceed is to establish ``no land disposal'' as the treatment standard.EPA has recently learned that some F006, K022 and K083 wastewaters maybe disposed through underground injection. If this is the case, the ``NoLand Disposal'' standard proposed for these wastewaters would precludecontinued injection of untreated wastewaters unless a no migration petitionhad been granted. The Agency intends to seek clarification of the circumstancesin which these wastes are being injected underground in order to determinewhether the ``No Land Disposal'' standard should be modified. The Agencythus seeks comment on the circumstances surrounding injection of F006,K022 and K083 wastes, and on the nature of the wastes being injected. <ITAG tagnum="81">10. Waste Specific Treatment Standards </ITAG>This section describes the development of BDAT treatment standards forall of the First Third treatability groups covered by today's rule. Itincludes tables showing the specific constituents regulated, as well asthe treatment standards. a. F006_Wastewater treatment sludges from electroplating operations exceptfrom the following processes: (1) Sulfuric acid anodizing of aluminum;(2) tin plating on carbon steel; (3) zinc plating (segregated basis) oncarbon steel; (4) aluminum or zinc-aluminum plating on carbon steel; (5)cleaning/stripping associated with tin, zinc and aluminum plating on carbonsteel; and (6) chemical etching and milling of aluminum. 1. <T3>Industry Affected and Waste Description.</T3> The listed waste F006is primarily generated by facilities in the electroplating or metal finishingindustries. However, F006 is often generated by many industries where electroplatingis a secondary operation. The Agency estimates that there are approximately4,500 facilities that potentially generate F006. While this waste is generatedin just about all portions of the United States, a large proportion ofthe facilities generating F006 are located in the Midwest, Northeast, andSoutheast. Electroplating has been broadly defined by the Agency to include electrodepositionof common and precious metals, anodizing, chemical conversion coating,electroless plating, immersion plating, chemical etching and milling, andprinted circuit board manufacture (51 FR 43350). The overall process isusually conducted in a series of baths used for various operations suchas degreasing, acid etching, prerinsing, passivation, electrodeposition,and/or product rinsing. These baths often generate wastewater streams containingmetals, metal salts, acids, alkalis, and various bath control compounds.These wastewater streams are typically combined and treated to generatea precipitated, nonwastewater residual defined as F006. The treated wastewateris typically discharged to a POTW or to a surface water under a NPDES permit.Untreated F006 wastes are typically aqueous sludges containing up to 60%by weight filterable solids comprised primarily of hydroxide or sulfidesalts of the metals used in the electroplating process. Since at differentplants, different combinations of metals are being plated and since a varietyof rinse waters and bath solutions are mixed and treated in the wastewatertreatment systems, concentrations of BDAT List metals can vary widely.Wastes identified as F006 are typically generated as sludges that, forthe purposes of BDAT, are classified as nonwastewaters. 2. <T3>Applicable/Demonstrated Treatment Technologies.</T3> Because of thehigh water content of the waste, dewatering technologies such as vacuumfiltration, plate and frame pressure filtration, and centrifugation havebeen identified as applicable technologies for reducing the water entrainedin the waste. This generally will reduce the volume of solid residualsthat require disposal. These technologies, however, are merely simple physicaltreatment technologies. The Agency does not believe that such technologiesprovide any significant treatment of the metals or cyanide contained inthe sludge. Dewatering technologies are not designed to provide chemicalbinding of constituents. Thus, little reduction in leachability of metalsand/or cyanide is achieved. However, dewatering can be considered an applicabletechnology when incorporated into a treatment train that includes wastewatertreatment technologies such as chromium reduction, cyanide destruction,metals precipitation, settling, filtration (or centrifugation), and solidification.The Agency has identified a few cases where metal recovery processes forF006 wastes have been performed. The concentrations and identity of metalsin F006 wastes vary widely depending on the specific metals used in theplating process. The Agency has determined that while metal recovery processesare applicable technologies for some F006 wastes, at this time, it hasnot been able to define any particular subcategories of F006 wastes thatwould be amenable to a particular recovery process. EPA is currently investigatingF006 wastes that are now being recovered, in order to determine the wastecharacteristics that would define these subcategories. Specifically, EPAis investigating high temperature metals recovery for those F006 wastesthat contain greater than 2.5% zinc. EPA solicits comments and data thatcan be evaluated for this purpose. EPA has identified stabilization as an applicable technology for treatmentof nonwastewater forms of F006. Stabilization is designed to chemicallybind metal constituents of the waste into the microstructure of a cementitiousmatrix. The purpose of stabilization is to immobilize the metal constituentsand thereby reduce their leaching potential. A variety of agents, includingPortland cements, cement kiln dust, hydrated limes, quick lime, fly ashand other pozzolanic materials, have been demonstrated to act as bindingagents for various types of wastes containing metals. Stabilization processesgenerate hardened solid residues that, for the purposes of BDAT, are classifiedas nonwastewaters. The Agency believes that these processes do not generatewastewater residuals. The Agency has data that indicate that this technologyis both applicable and demonstrated for F006. EPA does not consider stabilizationto be an applicable technology for the treatment of cyanide. EPA has identified alkaline chlorination, wet air oxidation, ozonation,electrolytic oxidation, and other chemical oxidation as applicable technologiesfor the treatment of cyanide contained in F006 wastes. All of these technologiesare designed to destroy cyanide by converting it to carbon dioxide andnitrogen gas. The Agency is currently investigating the use of these technologiesfor F006 wastes that contain treatable quantities of cyanide to establishthat it is demonstrated for these wastes.3. <T3>Data Base. </T3>The Agency has nine TCLP data points for nonwastewaterF006 (sludges) treated at a commercial treatment, storage, and disposalfacility using a stabilization technology. Cement kiln dust was used asthe chemical binding agent. All of the data points appear to representwell-designed and well-operated treatment. These data points were usedfor the development of the BDAT treatment standards for the metal constituents.The Agency has three TCLP data points for nonwastewater F006 (sludges)treated at a generator's facility using a stabilization technology. Analysisof the quality assurance information for this data was incomplete at thetime of this proposal. Therefore, these data points were not used for thedevelopment of the BDAT treatment standards for the metal constituents.This data is presented in the background document for this waste. 4. <T3>Identification of BDAT. </T3>BDAT for nonwastewater F006 (sludges)was determined to be stabilization for the metal constituents. Data andinformation submitted by the commercial hazardous waste treatment industryindicates that this technology is being widely used throughout the UnitedStates. EPA has determined that this technology is both applicable anddemonstrated for nonwastewater F006 sludges. The Agency currently has nodata demonstrating any other treatment or recycling technology for metalconstituents that would be applicable to all F006 wastes. Stabilizationis judged to be available to treat the metal constituents of F006 wastesbecause (1) it is commercially available or can be purchased from the technologydeveloper and (2) it provides a substantial reduction in the leaching potentialof hazardous constituents. BDAT for F006 wastes that also contain cyanide is stabilization of themetal constituents preceded by a pretreatment step to destroy the cyanide.The Agency is currently investigating the use of technologies such as alkalinechlorination, wet air oxidation, ozonation, electrolytic oxidation, andother chemical oxidation as applicable technologies for F006 wastes thatcontain treatable quantities of cyanide. EPA will confirm these technologiesas BDAT when this data becomes available. 5. <T3>Regulated Constituents and Treatment Standards. </T3>The proposed regulatedconstituents and BDAT treatment standards for wastes identified as F006are listed in the tables at the end of this section. The Agency believesthat regulating these constituents will ensure that other BDAT List constituentswill be effectively treated by the technologies determined to be BDAT.EPA's rationale for selecting the regulated constituents is presented inthe BDAT Background Document for this waste code. Facilities must complywith these treatment standards prior to placement of these wastes in landdisposal units. Those wastes that as generated naturally meet these standardsare not prohibited from disposal in these units. Dilution to achieve thesetreatment standards is forbidden. Treatment standards for metal constituents are based on analyses of leachatefrom the TCLP for all wastes identified as nonwastewaters. The units ofmeasure for all analyses of leachate are mg/l (or parts per million ona weight by volume basis). (i) <T3>Nonwastewaters. </T3>For wastes identified as F006 nonwastewaters,EPA is proposing to regulate twelve constituents from the BDAT List asindicators of effective treatment of these wastes. Eleven of these aremetal constituents including antimony, arsenic, barium, cadmium, totalchromium, copper, lead, nickel, selenium, silver, and zinc. At the timeof this proposal, the Agency has not completed its evaluation of wastecharacterization and treatment information for antimony, arsenic, barium,selenium and cyanide. Therefore, as noted above, the Agency is proposingto reserve BDAT standards for antimony, arsenic, barium, selenium and cyanideuntil this evaluation can be completed. (ii) <T3>Wastewaters. </T3>F006 waste is a sludge consisting of precipitatedresidues generated following treatment of electroplating wastewaters. Thetreated wastewater is typically discharged to a POTW or to a surface waterunder a NPDES permit. No additional wastewater is typically generated duringthe stabilization of nonwastewater F006 sludges. EPA recognizes that wastewater forms of F006 may be generated at a CERCLAsite, during a corrective action at a RCRA facility, as a leachate froma landfill, or as a residual from a treatment process such as sludge dewateringor a process other than stabilization (one that can achieve the same performance).Since generation of these types of wastewaters may occur, the Agency is,therefore, proposing a ``treatment standard'' for F006 wastewaters of ``NoLand Disposal''. By establishing this standard, a facility that generatesand needs to treat a wastewater, can submit a petition to the Agency fora variance from this treatment standard. The Agency believes that few,if any, petitions for a variance will be submitted because facilities generallywill discharge these wastewaters to a POTW or surface water under a NPDESpermit. However, EPA solicits comments from any facility that believesthat elimination of land disposal of these wastewaters is not feasibleand that numerical treatment standards should be promulgated. EPA has recently learned that some F006 wastewaters may be disposed throughunderground injection. If this is the case, the ``No Land Disposal'' standardwould preclude continued injection of untreated wastewaters unless a nomigration petition had been granted. The Agency intends to seek clarificationof the circumstances in which F006 wastewaters are being injected undergroundin order to determine whether the ``No Land Disposal'' standard shouldbe modified. The Agency thus seeks comment on the circumstances surroundinginjection of F006 wastewaters, and on the types of wastes being injected.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,10,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>F006 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Antimony <D>(\1\ ) </D><D>(\2\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic <D>(\1\ ) </D><D>(\2\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium <D>(\1\ ) </D><D>(\2\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>(\1\ ) </D><D>0.066 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>(\1\ ) </D><D>3.8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper <D>(\1\ ) </D><D>0.71 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\ ) </D><D>0.53 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>(\1\ ) </D><D>0.31 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium <D>(\1\ ) </D><D>(\2\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver <D>(\1\ ) </D><D>0.26 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zinc <D>(\1\ ) </D><D>0.086 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanide <D>(\2\ ) </D><D>(\2\ ) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable. </F><F>\2\ Reserved.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0),i1,s50 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>F006 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1> </H1>  <ITAG tagnum="21">NO LAND DISPOSAL</ITAG></ITAG> b. K001_Bottom sediment sludge from the treatment of wastewaters from woodpreserving processes that use creosote and/or pentachlorophenol. 1. <T3>Industry Affected and Waste Description. </T3>The listed waste K001is generated by facilities in the wood preserving industry. The Agencyestimates that there are approximately 400 facilities that have wood preservingprocesses that could potentially generate K001 waste. While this wastecan be generated in just about all portions of the United States, a largeproportion of the facilities generating K001 are located in the Southeast,Northwest, and Central parts of the United States. The preservation of wood using creosote and/or pentachlorophenol generateswastewaters containing hazardous constituents present in the preservatives.The treatment by any means (including simple settling) of these wastewatersgenerates the listed waste K001. Untreated K001 sludges consist of approximately 35% soil, 20% water, and25% total organics. The organic constituents present in the wastes includepentachlorophenol, creosote, phenolics, polynuclear aromatics, and somenonhalogenated volatiles. These wastes also contain less than 1% BDAT Listmetals. K001 wastes are characterized by their high filterable solids concentrationand high organic content. These wastes are typically generated as sludgesthat, for the purposes of BDAT, are classified as nonwastewaters. 2. <T3>Applicable/Demonstrated Treatment Technologies. </T3>EPA has identifiedincineration in a rotary kiln followed by stabilization of the resultantincinerator ash as applicable technologies for treatment of all nonwastewaterforms of K001. Rotary kiln incinerators are designed specifically to handlesludges, solids, tarry wastes, and containerized liquids that are difficultto atomize through a liquid injector. Many rotary kiln incinerators arealso designed to simultaneously incinerate other liquid wastes or supplementalfuel. The purpose of incineration is to thermally destroy (oxidize) theorganic constituents of a waste. The Agency recognizes that any technologysuch as a fluidized bed or multiple hearth incinerator that is designedfor thermal destruction of sludges, solids, or tarry wastes is potentiallyapplicable to these wastes. However, the Agency believes that the performanceof rotary kiln incineration attains the performance achievable by otherthermal destruction technologies that are well designed, well operated,and can handle sludges of this type. These incinerators generate ash residuesthat, for the purposes of BDAT, are classified as nonwastewaters. Scrubberwaters from air pollution control devices are often generated and are classifiedas wastewaters. Both of these residues must meet the BDAT treatment standardsprior to placement in land disposal units.EPA has identified stabilization as an applicable technology for treatmentof certain nonwastewater forms of K001. These include precipitated residuesfrom the treatment of wastewaters (such as scrubber waters), as well asash residues from incineration. Stabilization is designed to chemicallybind metal constituents of the waste into the microstructure of a cementitiousmatrix. The purpose of stabilization is to immobilize the metal constituentsand thereby reduce their leaching potential. A variety of agents, includingPortland cements, cement kiln dust, hydrated limes, quick lime, fly ashand other pozzolanic materials, have been demonstrated to act as bindingagents for various types of wastes containing metals. Stabilization processesgenerate hardened solid residues that, for the purposes of BDAT, are classifiedas nonwastewaters. The Agency believes that these processes do not generatewastewater residuals. The Agency has also identified a wastewater treatment system as an applicabletechnology for removal of metals from wastewater residuals (such as scrubberwaters) generated during treatment or handling of the nonwastewater formsof K001, followed by stabilization of the solid wastewater treatment residues.This wastewater treatment system includes a chemical precipitation stepto precipitate dissolved metals as solids followed by a filtration stepto remove these solids. The residues of this wastewater treatment systeminclude the treated wastewater and the solids that are classified, forthe purposes of BDAT, as nonwastewaters. Further application of a stabilizationprocess to these solids may be necessary in order to conform with the BDATtreatment standards for nonwastewaters. EPA has not identified any facility currently performing incineration andmetals (ash) stabilization of K001 on a commercial scale. However, EPAbelieves this technology is demonstrated for K001 in that it is being usedto treat wastes similar to K001. EPA has confirmed this judgment by usinga test facility to incinerate representative samples of K001 wastes. 3. <T3>Data Base.</T3> For K001 waste, the Agency tested rotary kiln incinerationat two facilities. The Agency has nine data sets for incineration of K001waste collected from two facilities representing both creosote waste andpentachlorophenol waste. Data collected during the testing of rotary kilnincineration technologies show that the treatment systems were well operated.The treatment residuals from rotary kiln incineration (ash and scrubberwater) are expected to contain metals in treatable concentrations. TheAgency has data for stabilization of metals in other incinerator ash andfor chemical precipitation of BDAT List metals in wastewaters. The Agency examined all available treatment data for stabilization of similarincinerator ash as well as chemical precipitation for similar wastewaters.These data were used to develop treatment standards for BDAT List metalsin the treatment residuals. 4. <T3>Identification of BDAT.</T3> EPA has determined that the treatmenttrain consisting of rotary kiln incineration followed by stabilizationof nonwastewater residuals, and chemical precipitation of metals for wastewaterresiduals from incineration, achieves a level of performance that representstreatment by BDAT. The Agency believes that these technologies are availableto treat K001 because (1) these technologies are commercially availabletechnologies and (2) incineration provides substantial reduction of organichazardous constituents, stabilization reduces the leachability of metalsin the nonwastewater residual, and chemical precipitation removes BDATList metals from the wastewater residual. 5. <T3>Regulated Constituents and Treatment Standards.</T3> The proposed regulatedconstituents and BDAT treatment standards for wastes identified as K001are listed in the tables at the end of this section. The Agency believesthat regulating these constituents will ensure that other BDAT List constituentswill be effectively treated by the technologies determined to be BDAT.EPA's rationale for selecting the regulated constituents is presented inthe BDAT Background Document for this waste code. Facilities must complywith these treatment standards prior to placement of these wastes in landdisposal units. Those wastes that as generated naturally meet these standardsare not prohibited from disposal in these units. Dilution to achieve thesetreatment standards is forbidden. Treatment standards for all organic constituents are based on analysesof total constituent concentration. Treatment standards for metal constituentsare based on analyses of leachate from the TCLP for all wastes identifiedas nonwastewaters and analyses of total constituent concentration for allwastes identified as wastewaters. The units of measure for all total constituentanalyses are mg/kg (or parts per million on a weight by weight basis) forthe nonwastewaters and mg/l (or parts per million on a weight by volumebasis) for wastewaters. The units of measure for all analyses of leachateare mg/l (or parts per million on a weight by volume basis). The Agency has recently become aware that data exist that indicate thepresence of trace levels of polychlorinated dibenzofurans and polychlorinateddibenzodioxins in some K001 wastes. At the time of this proposal, EPA hasnot completed its evaluation of these data and thus, defers its decisionto regulate these constituents as indicators of BDAT performance untilafter this evaluation can be completed. (i) <T3>Nonwastewaters.</T3> For wastes identified as K001 nonwastewaters,EPA is proposing to regulate six BDAT List organic constituents as indicatorsof effective incineration of these wastes. These include naphthalene, pentachlorophenol,phenanthrene, pyrene, toluene, and xylenes. EPA is also proposing to regulatethree metal constituents, copper, lead and zinc, as indicators of effectivestabilization of these wastes (based on data from the stabilization ofthe ash from incineration). EPA's proposed standard for pentachlorophenolis the result of a relatively high analytical quantitation limit observedfor this particular K001 waste. EPA solicits data reflecting the quantitationlimits attainable in other K001 wastes. (ii) <T3>Wastewaters.</T3> For wastes identified as K001 wastewaters, EPA isproposing to regulate the same six BDAT List organic constituents as indicatorsof effective destruction of organics in the combustion unit, thus preventingaccumulation of organics in scrubber waters. EPA is also proposing to regulatecopper, lead and zinc as indicators of effective precipitation of metalconstituents from these scrubber waters.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K001 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthalene<D> 7.98</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol<D> 36.75</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenanthrene<D> 7.98</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pyrene <D>7.28</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene <D>0.143</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylenes<D> 0.162</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper<D>(\1\) </D><D>0.71 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Lead<D>(\1\)</D><D> 0.53 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zinc<D>(\1\)</D><D> 0.086</D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K001 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthalene<D> 0.148</D><D>(\1\)  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol<D> 0.875</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenanthrene<D> 0.148</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pyrene<D> 0.140</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene<D> 0.143</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylenes<D> 0.161</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper<D> 0.42</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.037</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zinc <D>1.0</D><D>(\1\)</D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>c. K022_Distillation bottom tars from the production of phenol/acetonefrom cumene. 1. <T3>Industry Affected and Waste Description. </T3>The listed waste K022is generated by facilities in the organic chemicals manufacturing industry.The Agency estimates that there are eight facilities that have this specificproduction process that could potentially generate K022 waste. These arelocated in the Eastern, Central, and Southern parts of the United States.The cumene hydroperoxide process used in manufacturing acetone and phenolfrom cumene involves: (1) Oxidation of cumene to a concentrated cumenehydroperoxide; (2) acid cleavage of the hydroperoxide to phenol and acetonealong with a variety of other products (e.g., cumylphenols, acetophenone,dimethylphenylcarbinol, and alpha methylstyrene); (3) neutralization ofthe cleaved products with sodium hydroxide or other suitable base or withion-exchange resins; and (4) separation of the phenol and acetone usinga series of distillation columns. The still bottoms from the distillationcolumns are RCRA waste K022. As initially generated, K022 wastes are still bottoms that are typicallypumped directly from the distillation unit as viscous organic liquids,while they remain hot. Upon cooling, the viscosity of the waste will increaseand K022 can become tarry and viscous. It can be kept fluidized by mixingit with various light hydrocarbons, waste olefinic oils or solvents. Ifnot fluidized or kept hot, the waste will eventually harden into an organicsolid. K022 consists primarily of partially polymerized phenolics. Majorconstituents include acetophenone, phenol, and cumyl phenol. A total carboncontent of approximately 82-93% makes the waste an excellent fuel substitutewith a very high heat content reported as high as 35,300 BTU per pound.A low ash content and a low chlorine content are further indications ofits usefulness as a fuel substitute. BDAT List organic constituents reportedin significant concentrations are acetophenone, and phenol. Two other BDATlist constituents also were identified in the raw waste from one plantbut were claimed as confidential business information. Wastes identifiedas K022 are typically generated as still bottoms that, for the purposesof BDAT, are classified as nonwastewaters. 2. <T3>Applicable/Demonstrated Treatment Technologies. </T3>EPA has identifiedfuel substitution and liquid injection incineration as applicable technologiesfor treatment of BDAT List organics contained in nonwastewater K022 wastes.Fuel substitution involves the use of combustible organic wastes as substitutesfor conventional fuels burned in high temperature industrial processes.In order for a waste to be a good candidate for a fuel substitute, thewaste must have a reasonably high concentration of organic chemicals withsufficient heat content (BTU per pound). It must also have relatively lowconcentrations of noncombustible materials such as ash, water, metals,and chlorine. Fuel substitution, as a treatment process, has the same purposeas incineration; to thermally destroy (oxidize) the organic constituentsof a waste. The Agency believes that burning of K022 in a well designedand well operated high temperature industrial boiler or kiln attains theperformance achievable by other thermal destruction units such as liquidinjection incinerators. These thermal destruction units often generateash residues that, for the purposes of BDAT, are classified as nonwastewaters.Scrubber waters from air pollution control devices are not typically generatedfrom the units using K022 as a fuel substitute. If they were generated,they would be classified as wastewaters. Both of these residues, if generated,must meet the BDAT treatment standards prior to placement in land disposalunits. EPA has identified stabilization as an applicable technology for treatmentof BDAT List metals contained in the inorganic nonwastewater forms of K022.These include precipitated residues from the treatment of wastewaters (mixedwith or derived from K022 wastes), as well as ash residues from incineration.Stabilization is designed to chemically bind metal constituents of thewaste into the microstructure of a cementitious matrix. The purpose ofstabilization is to immobilize the metal constituents and thereby reducetheir leaching potential. A variety of agents, including Portland cements,cement kiln dust, hydrated limes, quick lime, fly ash and other pozzolanicmaterials, have been demonstrated to act as binding agents for varioustypes of wastes containing metals. Stabilization processes generate hardenedsolid residues that, for the purposes of BDAT, are classified as nonwastewaters.The Agency believes that these processes do not generate wastewater residuals.The Agency has determined that six of the eight facilities that generateK022 are subsequently using the waste as a fuel substitute. The Agencyhas data that indicate incineration can achieve treatment levels similarto these fuel substitution processes on wastes with similar waste characteristics.Therefore, the Agency has determined that both fuel substitution and incinerationare demonstrated for K022 nonwastewaters. 3. <T3>Data Base. </T3>For waste code K022, the Agency has treatment datafrom two facilities using fuel substitution. EPA has twelve untreated andtreated data points. 4. <T3>Identification of BDAT. </T3>EPA has determined that fuel substitutionfollowed by metals (ash) stabilization and metals precipitation of scrubberwater achieves a performance level that represents the best demonstratedavailable treatment technology (BDAT) for nonwastewater forms of K022.While no specific data are available on incineration of K022 in a rotarykiln, EPA believes that it would achieve the same level of performanceas fuel substitution. This treatment system is judged to be available totreat K022 because (1) the treatment system is commercially available and(2) the system provides a substantial reduction in the concentration ofBDAT List organic constituents in K022. 5. <T3>Regulated Constituents and Treatment Standards. </T3>The proposed regulatedconstituents and BDAT treatment standards for wastes identified as K022are listed in the tables at the end of this section. The Agency believesthat regulating these constituents will ensure that other BDAT List constituentswill be effectively treated by the technologies determined to be BDAT.EPA's rationale for selecting the regulated constituents is presented inthe BDAT Background Document for this waste code. Facilities must complywith these treatment standards prior to placement of these wastes in landdisposal units. Those wastes that as generated naturally meet these standardsare not prohibited from disposal in these units. Dilution to achieve thesetreatment standards is forbidden. Treatment standards for all organic constituents are based on analysesof total constituent concentration. Treatment standards for metal constituentsare based on analyses of leachate from the TCLP for all wastes identifiedas nonwastewaters and analyses of total constituent concentration for allwastes identified as wastewaters. The units of measure for all total constituentanalyses are mg/kg (or parts per million on a weight by weight basis) forthe nonwastewaters and mg/l (or parts per million on a weight by volumebasis) for wastewaters. The units of measure for all analyses of leachateare mg/l (or parts per million on a weight by volume basis). (i) <T3>Nonwastewaters. </T3>For wastes identified as K022 nonwastewaters,EPA is proposing to regulate eight constituents from the BDAT List as indicatorsof effective treatment of these wastes. These include toluene, acetophenone,phenol, diphenylamine, diphenyl nitrosamine, sulfide, nickel and totalchromium. The standard for diphenylamine and diphenylnitrosamine is listedas the sum of these constituents. This is necessary because the two compoundscannot be distinguished using EPA's standard analytical testing procedure.At the time of this proposal, the Agency has not completed its evaluationof waste characterization and treatment data for sulfide. Therefore, theAgency is proposing to reserve a standard for sulfide until this evaluationcan be completed. A sample of untreated ash from the burning of K022 as a fuel substitutewas analyzed for isomers of chlorinated dibenzofurans and chlorinated dibenzodioxins.A trace amount (parts per trillion) of tetrachlorodibenzofurans (TCDF)was detected in this sample. This amount was determined to be below thetypical BDAT quantitation level for these compounds. Therefore, the Agencyis not proposing a treatment standard for TCDF. The Agency is currentlyreexamining the validity of the quantification of this analysis. K022 wastesdo not typically have any chlorinated organics that could be the sourceor precursor of the TCDF. The Agency is investigating potential mechanismsfor its formation due to the presence of other chlorinated organics inthe wastes that were blended with the K022. (ii) <T3>Wastewaters. </T3>No scrubber waters are typically generated duringthe use of nonwastewater K022 as a fuel substitute. No additional wastewateris typically generated during the stabilization of the resultant ash residues.EPA recognizes that wastewater forms of K022 may be generated at a CERCLAsite, during a corrective action at a RCRA facility, as a leachate froma landfill, or as a residual from an incineration process that does generatea scrubber water. Since generation of these types of wastewaters may occur,the Agency is therefore, proposing a ``treatment standard'' for K022 wastewatersof ``No Land Disposal''. By establishing this standard, a facility thatgenerates and needs to treat a wastewater, can submit a petition to theAgency for a variance from this treatment standard. The Agency believesthat few petitions for a variance will be submitted. However, EPA solicitscomments from facilities that believe that land disposal of K022 wastewatersis unavoidable. EPA has recently learned that some K022 wastewaters may be disposed throughunderground injection. If this is the case, the ``No Land Disposal'' standardwould preclude continued injection of untreated wastewaters unless a nomigration petition had been granted. The Agency intends to seek clarificationof the circumstances in which K022 wastewaters are being injected undergroundin order to determine whether the ``No Land Disposal'' standard shouldbe modified. The Agency thus seeks comment on the circumstances surroundinginjection of K022 wastewaters, and on the types of wastes being injected.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standard for </T4>K022 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Acetophenone <D>19.0 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenol <D>12.0 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene <D>0.034 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sum of diphenylamine and diphenylnitrosamine <D>13.0 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sulfide <D>Reserved </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>(\1\) </D><D>3.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.25 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0),s25 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standard for </T4>K022 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1> </H1>  <ITAG tagnum="21">[No land disposal]</ITAG></ITAG>  d. K046_Wastewater treatment sludges from the manufacturing, formulation,and loading of lead based initiating compounds. 1. <T3>Industry Affected and Waste Description. </T3>The listed waste K046is generated by facilities in the explosives manufacturing industry. TheAgency estimates that there are approximately 150 facilities that haveprocesses that could potentially generate treatment sludges identifiedas K046. Approximately 35 of these are government owned military facilities.While these wastes are generated in just about all portions of the UnitedStates, a large proportion of the nonmilitary facilities are located inCalifornia, Utah, Missouri and Pennsylvania and the military facilitiesare located primarily in Tennessee, Wisconsin, Virginia and Illinois. Wastewaters are produced during various stages in the manufacture and formulationof lead-based initiating compounds (ones that initiate other explosives)and during the fabrication of these compounds into finished products (suchas ammunition). These wastewaters are contaminated with these initiatingcompounds and with other feedstock chemicals. The wastewater is treatedby boiling and/or addition of caustic to decompose residual explosive material.A sludge is generated from this wastewater treatment and is identifiedas the listed waste K046. K046 wastewater treatment ``sludges'' are typically generated as a fluidmixture consisting of approximately 95% by weight water and total organiccarbon content of approximately 460 ppm. The primary BDAT List constituentin K046 is lead. Wastes identified as K046 are typically generated as sludgesthat, for the purposes of BDAT, are classified as nonwastewaters. 2. <T3>Applicable/Demonstrated Treatment Technologies. </T3>EPA has identifiedstabilization as an applicable technology for treatment of nonwastewaterforms of K046. Stabilization is designed to chemically bind metal constituentsof the waste into the microstructure of a cementitious matrix. The purposeof stabilization is to immobilize the metal constituents and thereby reducetheir leaching potential. A variety of agents, including Portland cements,cement kiln dust, hydrated limes, quick lime, fly ash and other pozzolanicmaterials, have been demonstrated to act as binding agents for varioustypes of wastes containing metals. Stabilization processes generate hardenedsolid residues that, for the purposes of BDAT, are classified as nonwastewaters.The Agency believes that these processes do not generate wastewater residuals.EPA has not identified any facility currently performing stabilizationof K046 on a commercial scale. EPA believes stabilization is demonstratedfor K046, in that, it is being used to treat wastes that EPA believes havetreatability characteristics similar to K046. EPA has confirmed this judgmentby using a test facility to stabilize this waste. 3. <T3>Data Base. </T3>The Agency has ten data sets for K046 nonwastewaters.Data were collected by the EPA at a single test facility that employs stabilizationusing various binder materials. The ten data points for K046 waste wereobtained using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure and appearto represent proper design and operation. These data points were consideredin the development of the treatment standards for K046. 4. <T3>Identification of BDAT. </T3>EPA has determined that the performanceachieved by stabilization represents treatment by BDAT. The Agency performedan analysis of variance test for TCLP performance levels achieved by stabilizationusing three different binder materials: Portland cement, kiln dust, andlime/flyash. The results show that stabilization using Portland cementbinder provides significantly better reduction with regard to the concentrationsof metals in the leachate than the other two binder materials tested. Stabilizationis judged to be available to treat K046 because (1) the treatment systemis commercially available and (2) the system provides a substantial reductionin the leachable levels of BDAT List metals present in the K046 wastes.5. <T3>Regulated Constituents and Treatment Standards. </T3>The proposed regulatedconstituents and BDAT treatment standards for wastes identified as K046are listed in the tables at the end of this section. The Agency believesthat regulating these constituents will ensure that other BDAT List constituentswill be effectively treated by the technologies determined to be BDAT.EPA's rationale for selecting the regulated constituents is presented inthe BDAT Background Document for this waste code. Facilities must complywith these treatment standards prior to placement of these wastes in landdisposal units. Those wastes that as generated naturally meet these standardsare not prohibited from disposal in these units. Dilution to achieve thesetreatment standards is forbidden. Treatment standards for metal constituents are based on analyses of leachatefrom the TCLP for all wastes identified as nonwastewaters. The units ofmeasure for all analyses of leachate are mg/l (or parts per million ona weight by volume basis). (i). <T3>Nonwastewaters. </T3>For wastes identified as K046 nonwastewaters,EPA is proposing to regulate only lead as an indicator of effective treatmentof these wastes. The Agency is also proposing a treatment standard of ``NoLand Disposal'' for K046 nonwastewaters that are explosive. If a K046 wasteis explosive and remains explosive after treatment by solidification itshould meet the same requirements as the explosive wastes identified asK044, K045 and K047. The Agency specifically requests comments on thisapproach. (ii) <T3>Wastewaters. </T3>No additional wastewater is typically generated duringthe stabilization of nonwastewater K046 sludges. EPA recognizes that wastewaterforms of K046 may be generated at a CERCLA site, during a corrective actionat a RCRA facility, as a leachate from a landfill, or as a residual fromdewatering or a treatment process other than stabilization (one that canachieve the same performance). Since generation of these types of wastewatersmay occur, the Agency is therefore, proposing a ``treatment standard''for K046 wastewaters of ``No Land Disposal''. By establishing this standard,a facility that generates and needs to treat a wastewater, can submit apetition to the Agency for a variance from this treatment standard. TheAgency believes that few, if any, petitions for a variance will be submittedbecause these wastewaters usually will be discharged to a POTW or to surfacewaters following treatment to meet NPDES requirements.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K046 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\ ) </D><D>0.176 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0,,),p0,7/8,i1,s20 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K046 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters and Explosive Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="21">No Land Disposal</ITAG></ITAG> e. K083_Distillation bottoms from aniline production. 1. <T3>Industry Affected and Waste Description. </T3>The listed waste K083is generated by facilities in the organic chemicals manufacturing industry.The Agency estimates that there are six facilities that have this specificproduction process that could potentially generate K083 waste. Aniline is produced almost exclusively by the vapor-phase reduction ofnitrobenzene in the presence of a copper catalyst. In a typical process,nitrobenzene is vaporized and fed with excess hydrogen into a reactor.The crude product mixture leaving the reactor consists primarily of aniline,water, hydrogen and some unreacted nitrobenzene. This mixture is condensedto separate the aniline/water mixture from the hydrogen gas stream. Thetwo-phase aniline/water mixture is then separated in a decanter and theaniline phase is purified by a two-stage distillation process. The heavyends from the distillation process is the listed waste K083. Untreated K083 wastes are viscous organic liquids consisting of 45 to 85%by weight of a mixture of aniline, diphenylamine, nitrobenzene, phenylenediamine,and benzene. It also contains approximately 15 to 55% by weight of otherunidentified organics. The BDAT List organic constituents of concern includeaniline, phenylenediamine, diphenylamine, nitrobenzene and benzene. Theheat content of the waste is approximately 13,500 BTU per pound. The totalorganic halogen content of K083 has been reported to range from 0.03 to0.3% (as Chlorine). Copper is the only metal anticipated to be presentand has been measured at 2.5 ppm. 2. <T3>Applicable/Demonstrated Treatment Technology. </T3>The Agency has identifiedliquid injection incineration and fuel substitution as applicable technologiesfor the nonwastewater forms of K083. These technologies have been selecteddue to the high heat (BTU) content, the low halogen content, the low metalcontent, and the fact that the waste can be handled as a liquid. EPA has identified fuel substitution as an applicable technology for treatmentof liquid forms of nonwastewater K083. Fuel substitution involves the useof combustible organic wastes as substitutes for conventional fuels burnedin high temperature industrial processes. In order for a waste to be agood candidate for a fuel substitute, the waste must have reasonably highconcentrations of organic chemicals in order to have sufficient heat content.It must also have relatively low concentrations of noncombustible materialssuch as ash, water, metals, and chlorine. Fuel substitution, as a treatmentprocess, has the same purpose as incineration; to thermally destroy (oxidize)the organic constituents of a waste. The Agency believes that burning ofK083 in a well designed and well operated high temperature industrial boileror kiln attains the performance achievable by other thermal destructionunits such as liquid incinerators. Ash residues and scrubber waters arenot typically generated using these fuel substitution processes. EPA has identified incineration in units with liquid injection as an applicabletechnology for treatment of nonwastewater forms of K083. Many incineratorsare designed specifically to handle only liquid wastes, while others aredesigned to handle both liquids and solids (or sludges). The purpose ofincineration is to thermally destroy (oxidize) the organic constituentsof a waste. The Agency recognizes that any technology that is designedfor thermal destruction of liquids is potentially applicable to these wastes.However, the Agency believes that the performance of liquid injection incineratorsattains the performance achievable by other thermal destruction technologiesthat are well designed and well operated. While many liquid incineratorsgenerate ash residues and scrubber water residues, the Agency believesthat all of the facilities that currently incinerate K083 or use K083 asa fuel substitute are not generating either of these residue types. Liquid injection incineration has been demonstrated on a commercial basisfor the treatment of K083 at two of the facilities that generate K083.Fuel substitution in a steam boiler has been demonstrated on a commercialbasis at one of the facilities that generates K083. 3. <T3>Data Base. </T3>The Agency visited one facility that employs liquidinjection incineration as a treatment for the listed waste K083. Accordingto plant personnel, no residual ash or scrubber wastewaters are generatedfrom this treatment technology. The analyses of the ash content of untreatedK083 confirmed that no ash could be detected below the limit of 0.01% byweight. This facility did not have a vent scrubber or other pollution controldevice on the liquid injection incinerator and, therefore, did not generateany scrubber water. 4. <T3>Identification of BDAT. </T3>EPA has determined that the performanceachieved by liquid injection incineration or fuel substitution representstreatment by BDAT. EPA has determined that liquid injection incinerationof K083 can be accomplished without generating any residuals, either ashor scrubber water. Therefore, the level of performance achieved by liquidinjection incineration obviously cannot be improved upon. Liquid injectionincineration has been demonstrated on a commercial basis. The Agency alsobelieves this technology is available because: (1) This technology is commerciallyavailable or can be purchased from a proprietor and (2) this technologyachieves substantial reduction of the hazardous organic constituents presentin waste K083. Fuel substitution of K083 is also considered by the Agencyto be BDAT. Fuel substitution has been demonstrated on a commercial basis.5. <T3>Regulated Constituents and Treatment Standards. </T3>The Agency isproposing that, since no residuals are anticipated from the use of eitherBDAT technology, the BDAT ``treatment standard'' for wastes identifiedas K083 is ``No Land Disposal''. The Agency recognizes that the possibilityexists that these wastes may be generated at a CERCLA site, during a correctiveaction at a RCRA facility, or from the use of a treatment technology thatdoes produce a residual. By establishing the standard as ``No Land Disposal'',a facility that does generates a treatment residual, can submit a petitionto the Agency for a variance from this treatment standard. The Agency believesthat few petitions for a variance will be submitted. EPA strongly urges facilities that have K083 wastes that they believe willgenerate a treatment residual, to comment on this rule. Specifically, commentsshould provide the following: (1) Reasons why the K083 waste generatedat their site is believed to be different than the waste described in thispreamble; (2) a description of the treatment technology currently beingused to treat the K083 generated at their site; and (3) analytical data,including analyses for total constituents, on the residuals (either ashor scrubber water) that are generated by the treatment technology. EPA has recently learned that some K083 wastewaters may be disposed throughunderground injection. If this is the case, the ``No Land Disposal'' standardwould preclude continued injection of untreated wastewaters unless a nomigration petition had been granted. The Agency intends to seek clarificationof the circumstances in which K083 wastewaters are being injected undergroundin order to determine whether the ``No Land Disposal'' standard shouldbe modified. The Agency thus seeks comment on the circumstances surroundinginjection of K083 wastewaters, and on the types of wastes being injected.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0,,),p0,7/8,i1,s20 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K083 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters and Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1> </H1>  <ITAG tagnum="21">No Land Disposal</ITAG></ITAG>f. K086_Solvent washes and sludges, caustic washes and sludges, or waterwashes and sludges from the cleaning tubs and equipment used in the formulationof ink from pigments, driers, soaps, and stabilizers containing chromiumand lead. 1. <T3>Industry Affected and Waste Description.</T3> The listed waste K086is generated by facilities in the ink formulation industry. The Agencyestimates that there are approximately 460 facilities that formulate inkand may potentially generate K086 waste. While this waste can be generatedin just about all portions of the United States, a large proportion ofthe facilities generating K086 are located in California, New Jersey, andin states surrounding the Great Lakes. By definition K086 wastes can be from one of three major subcategories(depending on the material used for washing). These are: (1) Solvent washes;(2) solvent sludges; and (3) caustic/water washes and sludges. However,EPA is not establishing treatment standards at this time for the lattertwo subcategories. Thus, the discussion that follows relates only to thesolvent washes subcategory. K086 solvent washes can also vary dependingupon which solvent is used to clean the ink formulating equipment. Theprincipal solvents used include acetone, n-butyl alcohol, cyclohexanone,1,2-dichlorobenzene, ethyl acetate, ethyl benzene, methanol, methyl isobutylketone, methyl ethyl ketone, methylene chloride, naphthalene, nitrobenzene,toluene, 1,1,1,-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, and xylenes. It isimportant to note that some of these solvents also fall under the F001-F005solvent listings. In such cases, the treatment standards for the F001-F005wastes that were promulgated in November, 1986, are already in effect.It should be noted, however, that elsewhere in this notice, the Agencyis proposing to modify one of the solvent standards. This change is notexpected to impact the standards applicable to ink formulators. For the purposes of investigating BDAT, the solvent washes subcategoryis defined as those K086 wastes which are derived from processes whichhave used any of the following chemicals as a solvent: Acetone, n-butylalcohol, cyclohexanone, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, ethyl acetate, ethyl benzene,methanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, methylene chloride,naphthalene, nitrobenzene, toluene, 1,1,1,-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene,and/or xylenes. The solvent washes usually contain relatively high concentrations of thecleaning solvents used and low concentrations of solids. The solvent sludgescontain relatively high concentrations of solids. This difference in solidscontent changes the applicability of the type of incineration unit or fuelsubstitution unit that would be necessary to destroy the organic constituentsin the waste. 2. <T3>Applicable/Demonstrated Treatment Technologies.</T3> EPA has identifiedfuel substitution as an applicable technology for treatment of K086 solventwashes. Fuel substitution involves the use of combustible organic wastesas substitutes for conventional fuels burned in high temperature industrialprocesses. In order for a waste to be a good candidate for a fuel substitute,the waste must have a reasonably high concentration of organic chemicalsin order to have sufficient heat content. It must also have relativelylow concentrations of noncombustible materials such as ash, water, metals,and chlorine. Fuel substitution, as a treatment process, has the same purposeas incineration; to thermally destroy (oxidize) the organic constituentsof a waste. The Agency believes that burning of K086 as a fuel in a welldesigned and well operated high temperature industrial boiler or kiln attainsthe performance achievable by other thermal destruction units such as liquidincinerators. Any treatment residues generated from the use of these fuelsubstitution processes must meet the BDAT treatment standards prior toplacement in land disposal units. Batch distillation and fractional distillation can be used to separatecomponents having different boiling points. Distillation technologies canbe used to recover solvents from the solvent washes subcategory. Thesetechnologies reduce the amount of material to be treated; nevertheless,the bottoms from this process would require treatment by incineration priorto land disposal. EPA has identified incineration in units with liquid injection as an applicabletechnology for K086 solvent washes as well as incineration in a rotarykiln. Liquid injection incinerators are designed to only handle liquidwastes. Rotary kiln incinerators are designed specifically to handle sludges,solids, tarry wastes, and containerized liquids but, simultaneously canalso incinerate injected liquid wastes. The purpose of all incinerationis to thermally destroy (oxidize) the organic constituents of a waste.The Agency recognizes that any technology such as a fluidized bed or multiplehearth incinerator that is designed for thermal destruction is potentiallyapplicable to these wastes. However, the Agency believes that the performanceof liquid injection incinerators attains the performance achievable byother thermal destruction technologies that are well designed and welloperated. For the purposes of BDAT, any solid ash residues are classifiedas nonwastewaters. Scrubber waters from air pollution control devices areclassified as wastewaters. Both of these residues must meet the BDAT treatmentstandards for the K086 solvent washes subcategory prior to placement inland disposal units. EPA has determined that the applicable technology for scrubber waters isa wastewater treatment system that includes a hexavalent chromium reductionstep to convert any hexavalent chromium to the trivalent state and a chemicalprecipitation step to precipitate dissolved metals as solids followed bya filtration step to remove these solids. The residues of this wastewatertreatment system include the treated wastewater and the solids that areclassified, for the purposes of BDAT, as nonwastewaters. Further applicationof a stabilization process to these solids may be necessary in order toconform with the BDAT treatment standards for K086 nonwastewaters. EPA has identified stabilization as an applicable technology for treatmentof K086 nonwastewater residues that do not meet the BDAT standards forK086. These include precipitated residues from the treatment of K086 scrubberwaters, as well as ash residues which may be potentially generated fromeither incineration or fuel subtitution. Stabilization is designed to chemicallybind metal constituents of the waste into the microstructure of a cementitiousmatrix. The purpose of stabilization is to immobilize the metal constituentsand thereby reduce their leaching potential. A variety of agents, includingPortland cements, cement kiln dust, hydrated limes, quick lime, fly ashand other pozzolanic materials, have been demonstrated to act as bindingagents for various types of wastes containing metals. Stabilization processesgenerate hardened solid residues that, for the purposes of BDAT, are considerednonwastewaters. The Agency believes that the majority of these processesdo not generate residuals that are considered wastewaters. 3. <T3>Data Base.</T3> The Agency's preference is for total recycling forthe K086 solvent washes. However, residues from batch distillation arestill bottoms that need additional treatment (i.e., incineration and stabilization)prior to land disposal. Therefore, the Agency tested incineration for treatmentof the K086 solvent washes subcategory. At an EPA testing facility, K086 wastes from the solvent washes subcategorywere incinerated in a rotary kiln/liquid injection incinerator. The datawere collected by EPA at its in-house facility. Operating data collectedduring the treatment test show that the facility was properly operatedduring the time that the waste was being treated. Treatment standards forthe BDAT List metals are being transferred from wastewater metals treatmentdata for similar wastes that have been previously developed by the Agency.4. <T3>Identification of BDAT.</T3> Incineration is demonstrated for treatmentof BDAT List organics in K086 solvent washes. The resultant quench watersor scrubber waters are, for the purposes of BDAT, classified as wastewaters.Treatment for the removal of BDAT metals contained by these wastewaterswill result in a sludge, which for the purposes of BDAT, are classifiedas nonwastewaters. Further details regarding BDAT development and datatransfer are provided in the Background Document for this waste code. Incineration of BDAT List organics contained in the solvent washes generateda scrubber water that contained BDAT List Metals. EPA does not have treatmentdata specifically for treatment of this scrubber water. The Agency doeshave performance data on a metal bearing wastewater judged to be similarto the K086 scrubber water. These data consist of eleven data points fromone facility using chromium reduction followed by lime precipitation andsludge filtration. The BDAT List metals contained by the solid residualgenerated from this treatment system did not require further treatmentbecause TCLP leachate concentrations were not found at treatable levels.These technologies are judged to be available to treat these wastes because:(1) They are commercially available or can be purchased from a proprietorand (2) they provide substantial reduction of the concentration of hazardousconstituents released into the environment. 5. <T3>Regulated Constituents and Treatment Standards.</T3> As noted above,the Agency is not, at this time, proposing treatment standards for K086wastes in (1) the solvent sludges subcategory or (2) the caustic/waterwashes and sludges subcategory. Since no standards are being proposed forthese subcategories, the ``soft hammer'' provisions apply. For the purposes of proposing BDAT treatment standards, the solvent washessubcategory is defined as those K086 wastes which are derived from processeswhich have used any of the following chemicals as a solvent: Acetone, n-butylalcohol, cyclohexanone, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, ethyl acetate, ethyl benzene,methanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, methylene chloride,naphthalene, nitrobenzene, toluene, 1,1,1,-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene,and/or xylenes. These solvents are chemicals on the BDAT List that aretypically used in rinsing inks and could become K086 wastes.The proposed regulated constituents and BDAT treatment standards for wastesidentified as K086 in the solvent washes subcategory are listed in thetables at the end of this section. The Agency believes that regulatingthese constituents will ensure that other BDAT List constituents will becontrolled by the technologies determined to be BDAT. EPA's rationale forselecting the regulated constituents is presented in the BDAT BackgroundDocument for this waste code. Facilities must comply with these treatmentstandards prior to placement of these wastes in land disposal units. Thosewastes that as generated naturally meet these standards are not prohibitedfrom disposal in these units. Dilution to achieve these treatment standardsis forbidden. Treatment standards for all organic constituents are based on analysesof total constituent concentration. Treatment standards for metal constituentsare based on analyses of leachate from the TCLP for all wastes identifiedas nonwastewaters and analyses of total constituent concentration for allwastes identified as wastewaters. The units of measure for all total constituentanalyses are mg/kg (or parts per million on a weight by weight basis) forthe nonwastewaters and mg/1 (or parts per million on a weight by volumebasis) for wastewaters. The units of measure for all analyses of leachateare mg/1 (or parts per million on a weight by volume basis). The Agency has data that suggests that approximately sixteen differentBDAT List solvents could be used to clean ink formulating equipment. EPAis concerned that regulation of only the solvents that were found in thetested waste matrix would present an incentive to simply switch to theuse of other solvents. For this reason, EPA is proposing to regulate allsixteen BDAT List solvents. EPA transferred the performance data achievedfor some of these sixteen solvents from performance data for other solventsthat had similar physical and chemical properties. The Agency believesthat the solvents that have been determined to be similar, can be incineratedto the same treatment concentrations. Details on the transfer of standardscan be found in the BDAT Background Document for this waste code. EPA solicitscomments on this transfer of performance data. The comments should providedata that document that the proposed BDAT treatment standards are not achievable.For wastes identified as K086 nonwastewaters and wastewaters in the solventwashes subcategory, EPA is proposing to regulate seventeen organic constituentsand two metal constituents from the BDAT List as indicators of effectivetreatment of these wastes. These include acetone, n-butyl alcohol, ethylacetate, ethyl benzene, methanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethylketone, methylene chloride, toluene, 1,1,1,-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene,xylenes, bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, cyclohexanone, 1,2-dichlorobenzene,naphthalene, nitrobenzene, total chromium, and lead.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp9,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K086 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters; solvent washes subcategory]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Acetone<D> 0.37</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">n-Butyl alcohol<D> 0.37</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethyl acetate<D> 0.37</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethyl benzene<D> 0.031</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methanol<D> 0.37</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methyl isobutyl ketone<D> 0.37</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methyl ethyl ketone<D> 0.37</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methylene chloride<D> 0.037</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene<D> 0.031</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,1-Trichloroethane<D> 0.044</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trichloroethylene<D> 0.031</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylenes<D> 0.015</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate<D> 0.49</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyclohexanone<D> 0.49</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichlorobenzene<D> 0.49</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthalene<D> 0.49</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrobenzene<D> 0.49</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total)<D>(\1\)</D><D> 0.094 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>(\1\) </D><D>0.37 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp9,i1,s10,7.3,10 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K086 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters; solvent washes subcategory]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Acetone<D> 0.015</D><D>(\1\)  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">n-Butyl alcohol<D> 0.031</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethyl acetate<D> 0.031</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethyl benzene<D> 0.015</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methanol<D> 0.031</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methyl isobutyl ketone<D> 0.031</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methyl ethyl ketone<D> 0.031</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methylene chloride<D> 0.031</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene<D> 0.029</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,1-Trichloroethane<D> 0.031</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trichloroethylene<D> 0.029</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylenes<D> 0.015</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate<D> 0.044</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyclohexanone<D> 0.022</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichlorobenzene<D> 0.044</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthalene<D> 0.044</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrobenzene<D> 0.044</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total)<D> 0.32</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D> 0.037</D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> g. K087_Decanter tank tar sludge from coking operations. 1. <T3>Industry Affected and Waste Description.</T3> The listed waste K087is generated by facilities in the coking industry. The Agency estimatesthat there are 36 facilities that have coking plants with decanter tanksand, therefore, could potentially generate K087 waste. The majority ofthese facilities are located in the Eastern United States. In the production of coke, gases evolved from the coke ovens are collectedand subsequently cooled. The condensates and any entrained particulatesare channeled to a decanter tank where tar products and ammonia liquorare separated. The heavy residue (sludge) that settles to the bottom ofthe tank is K087 waste. K087 waste generally contains from six to eleven percent water and 89 to94 percent organic compounds, up to twenty percent of which are BDAT Listsemivolatile organics. The principal BDAT List metals present are arsenic,lead, copper, and zinc; the maximum concentrations for these metals measuredin these wastes are 6, 85, 5, and 66 ppm, respectively. The waste, a viscoussemisolid tar, has a heating value of approximately 15,000 Btu/lb. 2. <T3>Applicable/Demonstrated Treatment Technologies.</T3> EPA has identifiedfuel substitution and rotary kiln incineration as applicable technologiesfor treatment of K087 nonwastewaters. Fuel substitution involves the useof combustible organic wastes as substitutes for conventional fuels burnedin high temperature industrial processes. In order for a waste to be agood candidate for a fuel substitute, the waste must have a reasonablyhigh concentration of organic chemicals with sufficient heat content (BTUper pound). It must also have relatively low concentrations of noncombustiblematerials such as ash, water, metals, and chlorine. Fuel substitution,as a treatment process, has the same purpose as incineration; to thermallydestroy (oxidize) the organic constituents of a waste. The Agency believesthat burning of K087 in a well designed and well operated high temperatureindustrial furnace or kiln attains the performance achievable by otherthermal destruction units such as rotary kiln incinerators. These thermaldestruction units often generate ash residues that, for the purposes ofBDAT, are classified as nonwastewaters. Scrubber waters, from air pollutioncontrol devices of units using K087 as a fuel substitute, generally containless than 1% TOC and less than 1% filterable solids and, therefore, areclassified as wastewaters for the purposes of BDAT. Both of these residuesmust meet the BDAT treatment standards prior to placement in land disposalunits. Total recycling has been identified as a potentially applicable technologyfor K087 wastes. Total recycling involves treating the K087 waste for (1)reuse in the coke ovens or (2) production of a commercial tar product.Treatment prior to reuse frequently involves mixing the waste with a flushingliquor, grinding in a ball mill, and mixing the milled material with coal.This K087/coal mixture is fed back to the coke ovens for coke production.Alternatively, the waste may be added to hot tar, ground in a ball mill,and packaged as a saleable product. At this time, however, EPA has littledata available to define which K087 materials can be benefically recycled.Specific data were submitted by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI)to the EPA with respect to the practice of recycling K087 wastes (See Wednesday,May 6, 1987, FR 17019 and 17020). These data characterize the final products(e.g. coal tar and coke) that result from recycling of K087 and from processingthat did not involve recycling. Only one data point from AISI characterizedthe raw K087 decanter tar sludge. Therefore, the Agency solicits commentsand data to assist in definition of K087 wastes that can be recycled.Wastewater residuals are generated by some of the technologies that aredesignated as applicable to the nonwastewater forms of K087. The applicabletechnology for these wastewaters is a wastewater treatment system thatincludes a chemical precipitation step to remove metals from solution andprecipitate them as a solid residue and a filtration step to remove thesesolids. This wastewater treatment system results in a solid residue thatgenerally contains greater than 1% filterable solids and is considered,for the purposes of BDAT, a nonwastewater. This solid residue must conformwith the treatment standards for nonwastewaters. As described below, furtherapplication of a stabilization process to this residue may be necessaryin order to meet the BDAT standards for metals proposed for nonwastewaters.EPA has identified stabilization as an applicable technology for treatmentof BDAT List metals constituents in the nonwastewater K087 wastes identifiedas treatment residuals. These nonwastewaters include precipitated residuesfrom the treatment of wastewaters forms of K087, and ash residues fromincineration or fuel subtitution of K087, and any other nonwastewatersresulting from the ``mixture'' or ``derived-from'' rules. Stabilizationis designed to chemically bind metal constituents of the waste into themicrostructure of a cementitious matrix. The purpose of stabilization isto immobilize the metal constituents and thereby reduce their leachingpotential. A variety of agents, including Portland cements, cement kilndust, hydrated limes, quick lime, fly ash and other pozzolanic materials,have been demonstrated to act as binding agents for various types of wastescontaining metals. Stabilization processes generate hardened solid residuesthat, for the purposes of BDAT, are classified as nonwastewaters. The Agencybelieves that these processes do not generate wastewater residuals. All of the applicable technologies for BDAT List organics in K087 wasteare demonstrated. Data submitted by industry indicate that recycling andfuel substitution are commonly practiced. EPA has identified seven facilitiesthat use recycling and one facility that uses fuel substitution, and believesmany other facilities also use these technologies. The Agency has identifiedone facility that has used rotary kiln incineration of K087 wastes andthree generators that send their wastes offsite for multiple hearth incinerationof their K087 wastes. 3. <T3>Data Base. </T3>For K087 nonwastewaters, the Agency has five treateddata points (ash residues) showing treatment of BDAT List organics by rotarykiln incineration of K087 at an EPA test facility. Also, the Agency hasstabilization performance data using lime and fly ash as binders from thetreatment of wastes judged to have similar chemical and physical characteristicsto K087 ash residues. These stabilization data demonstrate treatment forBDAT List metals. For K087 wastewaters, the Agency has six treated data points showing thetreatment of BDAT List organics by rotary kiln incineration. Also, theAgency has eleven data points showing the treatment of BDAT List metalsby chemical precipitation followed by sludge filtration from the treatmentof wastes judged to have similar chemical and physical characteristicsto K087 scrubber waters. 4. <T3>Identification of BDAT. </T3>EPA is proposing rotary kiln incinerationas BDAT for BDAT List organics. EPA is soliciting comments and data thatsupport the fact that total recycling can be accomplished for some subcategoryof K087. If EPA receives comments and data that support a determinationthat total recycling can be accomplished, then EPA will promulgate ``NoLand Disposal'' as a BDAT treatment standard for that subgroup of K087wastes. EPA has determined that rotary kiln incineration is demonstratedand available, based on its use treating BDAT List organics contained inK087 and on its use for wastes with chemical and physical characteristicssimilar to K087. EPA has determined that stabilization of K087 ash is demonstrated for BDATList metals contained in K087 ash based on a waste judged to have similarchemical and physical characteristics to K087 wastes. With regard to K087wastewaters, EPA has identified chemical precipitation followed by sludgefiltration is demonstrated and available, based on the performance treatmentdata from wastewaters judged to have similar chemical and physical characteristicsto K087 wastewaters. 5. <T3>Regulated Constituents and Treatment Standards. </T3>The proposed regulatedconstituents and BDAT treatment standards for wastes identified as K087are listed in the tables at the end of this section. EPA's rationale forselecting the regulated constituents is presented in the BDAT BackgroundDocument for this waste code. Facilities must comply with these treatmentstandards prior to placement of these wastes in land disposal units. Thosewastes that as generated naturally meet these standards are not prohibitedfrom disposal in these units. Dilution to achieve these treatment standardsis forbidden. Treatment standards for all organic constituents are based on analysesof total constituent concentration. Treatment standards for metal constituentsare based on analyses of leachate from the TCLP for all wastes identifiedas nonwastewaters and analyses of total constituent concentration for allwastes identified as wastewaters. The units of measure for all total constituentanalyses are mg/kg (or parts per million on a weight by weight basis) forthe nonwastewaters and mg/l (or parts per million on a weight by volumebasis) for wastewaters. The units of measure for all analyses of leachateare mg/l (or parts per million on a weight by volume basis). Standards for BDAT List organic constituents in K087 wastewaters are basedon concentrations found in scrubber waters from rotary kiln incineration.Thermal destruction in a well-designed and well-operated unit results inlevels that are at or near the detection limit. Standards for metal constituentsin K087 nonwastewaters are based on the transfer of metals precipitation/removaldata for treatment of wastewaters containing metals of similar concentrations.These levels are believed to represent performance of the best demonstratedavailable technologies for these constituents in this waste type. Standards for BDAT organic constituents in K087 nonwastewaters are basedon the concentration found in K087 ashes from rotary kiln incineration.For BDAT List metal constituents, however, EPA transferred stabilizationperformance data from a waste judged to have similar chemical and physicalcharacteristics to K087 incinerator ashes. For wastes identified as K087 nonwastewaters and wastewaters, EPA is proposingto regulate nine organic constituents and two metal constituents from theBDAT List as indicators of effective treatment of these wastes. These includeacenaphthalene, benzene, chrysene, fluoranthene, indeno (1,2,3-cd) pyrene,naphthalene, phenanthrene, toluene, xylenes, lead, and zinc. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standard for </T4>K087 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Acenaphthalene <D>3.4 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene <D>0.071 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chrysene <D>3.4 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fluoranthene <D>3.4 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Indeno (1,2,3-cd) pyrene <D>3.4 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthalene <D>3.4 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenanthrene <D>3.4 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene <D>0.65 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylenes <D>0.070 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\ ) </D><D>0.53 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zinc <D>(\1\ ) </D><D>0.086 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,6.4 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standard for </T4>K087 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Acenaphthalene <D>0.028 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene <D>.014 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chrysene <D>.028 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fluoranthene <D>.028 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Indeno (1,2,3-cd) pyrene <D>.028 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthalene <D>.028 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenanthrene <D>.028 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene <D>.008 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylenes <D>.014 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>.037 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zinc <D>1.0 </D><D>(\1\ ) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>h. K099_Untreated wastewater from the production of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyaceticacid (2,4-D). 1. <T3>Industry Affected and Waste Description. </T3>The listed waste K099is generated by facilities in the organic chemicals manufacturing industry(specifically pesticides). The Agency estimates that there is only onefacility that produces 2,4-D and currently generates K099 waste. The manufacturing process for 2,4-D includes the reaction of 2,4-dichlorophenolwith chloroacetic acid in the presence of sodium hydroxide, hydrochloricacid and a catalyst. The 2,4-D is recovered using a solvent and is thenwater washed to form the final product. The wastewater generated from therecovery and water-wash processes is RCRA waste K099. The listed waste K099 principally consists of water, 2,4-D and 2,4-dichlorophenol.The specific concentrations have been claimed by the facility as confidential;however, the organic content of the waste is less than one percent. 2. <T3>Applicable/Demonstrated Treatment Technologies. </T3>The treatmenttechnologies that the Agency believes are applicable are chemical oxidation,wet air oxidation (a specialized form of chemical oxidation), carbon adsorptionfollowed by incineration of the carbon, and biological treatment followedby incineration of the biological sludge. Oxidation is a treatment processthat chemically destroys organics found in solution by reaction with anoxidizing agent such as oxygen, chlorine or hydrogen peroxide. Wet airoxidation is a treatment process that chemically destroys organics andsome inorganics by reaction with molecular oxygen at elevated temperaturesand pressures. Carbon adsorption is the adsorption of hazardous constituents(from a liquid or a gas) by surface attraction within the internal poresof the carbon granules. Biological treatment involves the use of naturallyoccurring, acclimated microorganisms to degrade organic contaminants inwastewater. Incineration technologies such as fluidized bed, rotary kiln,and liquid injection incineration, are destruction technologies that convertthe waste to carbon dioxide, water, and other combustion products. Of the applicable technologies, the Agency is aware of one facility usingoxidation to treat K099. The Agency is not aware of any facility usingwet air oxidation, carbon adsorption followed by incineration of the carbon,or biological treatment followed by incineration of the sludge to treatthe waste. The Agency did not test these technologies on the waste. 3. <T3>Data Base. </T3>For waste code K099, the Agency has treatment datafrom one facility. At this facility, the Agency collected two treatmentdata sets for chemical oxidation of K099 waste using chlorine. 4. <T3>Identification of BDAT. </T3>The best demonstrated available treatmenttechnology (BDAT) for K099 waste was determined to be chemical oxidationusing chlorine. This treatment system shows substantial treatment for 2,4-dichlorophenoxyaceticacid (2,4-D). EPA believes that chemical oxidation with chlorine is demonstratedon K099. This treatment system is judged to be available to treat K099because (1) the treatment system is commercially available and (2) thesystem provides a substantial reduction in the concentration of the BDATList organic constituents present in the largest concentrations in K099.5. <T3>Regulated Constituents and Treatment Standards. </T3>The proposed regulatedconstituents and BDAT treatment standards for wastes identified as K099are listed in the tables at the end of this section. The Agency believesthat regulating these constituents will ensure that other BDAT List constituentswill be effectively treated by the technologies determined to be BDAT.EPA's rationale for selecting the regulated constituents is presented inthe BDAT Background Document for this waste code. Facilities must complywith these treatment standards prior to placement of these wastes in landdisposal units. Those wastes that as generated naturally meet these standardsare not prohibited from disposal in these units. Dilution to achieve thesetreatment standards is forbidden. Treatment standards for all organic constituents are based on analysesof total constituent concentration. The units of measure for all totalconstituent analyses are mg/kg (or parts per million on a weight by weightbasis) for the nonwastewaters and mg/l (or parts per million on a weightby volume basis) for wastewaters. For wastes and treatment residues identified as K099 nonwastewaters orwastewaters, EPA is proposing to regulate seven organic constituents fromthe BDAT List as indicators of effective treatment of these wastes. Theseinclude 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and six chlorinated dioxins andchlorinated dibenzofurans. The 1 ppb analytical detection limit for theseconstituents described in the final rule for dioxin-containing wastes (51FR 40643) also is used here. This level represents the analytical limitof detection that can be routinely achieved. EPA specifically requests comment on the selection of chlorine oxidationas BDAT for K099. Chlorine oxidation was selected as the treatment technologyfor the destruction of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. The data indicatethat this technology provides significant reduction of this chemical. However,the data appear to indicate a slight increase in the concentration of chlorinateddioxins and dibenzofurans (all values below the routine quantitation limitof 1 part per billion) from the untreated waste to the treated residuals.At this time, EPA is not certain that this implies that the chlorine oxidationprocess is responsible for this slight increase. The Agency is specificallyrequesting comments and data that would indicate the existence of an alternativetreatment technology that could achieve the same performance for the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyaceticacid without an increase in the chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K099 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid <D>0.15 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzofurans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzofurans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzofurans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>  <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K099 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid <D>0.15 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzofurans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzofurans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzofurans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>i. K101_Distillation tar residues from the distillation of aniline-basedcompounds in the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals from arsenicor organo-arsenic compounds. K102_Residue from the use of activated carbon for decolorization in theproduction of veterinary pharmaceuticals from arsenic or organo-arseniccompounds. 1. <T3>Industry Affected and Waste Description. </T3>The listed wastes K101and K102 are generated by facilities in the veterinary pharmaceuticalsmanufacturing industry. The Agency estimates that there are only two facilitiesthat have production processes that could potentially generate K101 orK102 wastes. Wastewaters containing arsenic are generated in the manufacture of organo-arsenicveterinary pharmaceuticals. These wastewaters are combined with processarea wash waters and are pumped into a treatment system that consists ofchemical precipitation and resin adsorption. The resin column is regeneratedby a backwash of acetone. The spent acetone solvent mixture is recoveredin a distillation column. The distillation tar residues from the acetonerecovery column constitute the listed K101 waste. The manufacture of arsenic-containing pharmaceuticals requires the reactionof an organic compound with inorganic arsenic to form the organic arsenicalproduct, and generates arsenic-containing solid wastes including K102 waste.The Agency has detailed process flow information concerning the mannerin which K102 waste is generated. This information, however, has been claimedto be confidential business information (CBI). K101 wastes are viscous organic still bottoms containing approximately19% by weight ortho-nitroaniline and less than 1% arsenic. The heat contentof these wastes is approximately 7,000 BTU per pound. K102 wastes consistprimarily of spent activated carbon contaminated with approximately 300parts per million of ortho-nitrophenol. BDAT List organic constituentsidentified as present in K102 include phenol and ortho-nitrophenol. BDATList metal constituents identified as present in K101 and K102 includeantimony, arsenic, barium, cadmium, total chromium, copper, lead, nickel,selenium, and zinc. 2. <T3>Applicable/Demonstrated Treatment Technologies. </T3>EPA has identifiedincineration in a rotary kiln as an applicable technology for treatmentof nonwastewater forms of K101 identified as distillation tar residuesand nonwastewater forms of K102 identified as activated carbon residues.Rotary kiln incinerators are designed specifically to handle sludges, solids,tarry wastes, and containerized liquids that are difficult to atomize througha liquid injector. Many rotary kiln incinerators are also designed to simultaneouslyincinerate other liquid wastes or supplemental fuel. The purpose of incinerationis to thermally destroy (oxidize) the organic constituents of a waste.The Agency recognizes that any technology such as a fluidized bed or multiplehearth incinerator that is designed for thermal destruction of sludges,solids, or tarry wastes is potentially applicable to these wastes. However,the Agency believes that the performance of rotary kiln incineration attainsthe performance achievable by other thermal destruction technologies thatare well designed and well operated. These incinerators generate ash residuesthat, for the purposes of BDAT, are classified as nonwastewaters. Scrubberwaters from air pollution control devices are often generated and are classifiedas wastewaters. Both of these residues must meet the BDAT treatment standardsprior to placement in land disposal units. Wastewaters are generated as residuals by many of the incineration technologiesthat are designated as applicable to the nonwastewater forms of K101 andK102. EPA has determined that the applicable technology for these wastewatersis a wastewater treatment system that includes a chemical precipitationstep to precipitate dissolved metals as solids followed by a filtrationstep to remove these solids. The residues of this wastewater treatmentsystem include the treated wastewater and the solids that are classified,for the purposes of BDAT, as nonwastewaters. Further application of a stabilizationprocess to these solids may be necessary in order to conform with the BDATtreatment standards for nonwastewaters. EPA has identified stabilization as an applicable technology for treatmentof inorganic nonwastewater forms of K101 and K102. These include precipitatedresidues from the treatment of wastewaters, as well as ash residues fromincineration. Stabilization is designed to chemically bind metal constituentsof the waste into the microstructure of a cementitious matrix. The purposeof stabilization is to immobilize the metal constituents and thereby reducetheir leaching potential. A variety of agents, including Portland cements,cement kiln dust, hydrated limes, quick lime, fly ash and other pozzolanicmaterials, have been demonstrated to act as binding agents for varioustypes of wastes containing metals. Stabilization processes generate hardenedsolid residues that, for the purposes of BDAT, are classified as nonwastewaters.The Agency believes that these processes do not generate wastewater residuals.EPA has not identified any facility currently performing incineration andmetals (ash) stabilization of K101 or K102 on a commercial scale. However,EPA believes this technology is demonstrated for K101 and K102 in thatit is being used to treat wastes similar to them in regard to parametersaffecting treatment selection. EPA has confirmed this judgment by usinga test facility to incinerate this waste. 3. <T3>Data Base. </T3>For waste code K101, the Agency has treatment datafrom one full-scale facility. The Agency has four data points of untreatedK101 waste and three data points representing residual concentrations foundin the ash from rotary kiln incineration. The Agency has four scrubberwater data points that represent destruction of organic compounds in theafterburner of the rotary kiln incinerator. For waste code K102, the Agency has treatment data from one full-scalefacility. The Agency has four data sets of K102 waste treated by rotarykiln incineration. The Agency has six scrubber water data points that representdestruction of organic compounds in the afterburner of the rotary kilnincinerator. 4. <T3>Identification of BDAT. </T3>EPA has determined that the performanceachieved by incineration followed by metal stabilization of ash residuesrepresents treatment by BDAT for both K101 and K102. Incineration followedby metal stabilization is judged to be available to treat these wastesbecause: (1) These technologies are commercially available and (2) theyprovide substantial reduction in the levels of organic constituents andsubstantial reduction in the mobility of metal constituents present inthese wastes. 5. <T3>Regulated Constituents and Treatment Standards. </T3>The proposed regulatedconstituents and BDAT treatment standards for wastes identified as K101and K102 are listed in the tables at the end of this section. The Agencybelieves that regulating these constituents will ensure that other BDATList constituents will be effectively treated by the technologies determinedto be BDAT. EPA's rationale for selecting the regulated constituents ispresented in the BDAT Background Document for this waste code. Facilitiesmust comply with these treatment standards prior to placement of thesewastes in land disposal units. Those wastes that as generated naturallymeet these standards are not prohibited from disposal in these units. Dilutionto achieve these treatment standards is forbidden. Treatment standards for all organic constituents are based on analysesof total constituent concentration. Treatment standards for metal constituentsare based on analyses of leachate from the TCLP for all wastes identifiedas nonwastewaters and analyses of total constituent concentration for allwastes identified as wastewaters. The units of measure for all total constituentanalyses are mg/kg (or parts per million on a weight by weight basis) forthe nonwastewaters and mg/l (or parts per million on a weight by volumebasis) for wastewaters. The units of measure for all analyses of leachateare mg/l (or parts per million on a weight by volume basis).Standards for organic constituents are based on concentrations found inscrubber waters from thermal destruction units. Thermal destruction ina well designed and well operated unit results in levels that are at ornear the detection limit. Standards for metal constituents are based onthe transfer of metals precipitation/removal data for treatment of wastewatersthat contain metals at similar concentrations. These levels are believedto represent performance of the best demonstrated available technologiesfor these constituents in this waste type. (i) <T3>Nonwastewaters. </T3>For wastes identified as K101 and K102 nonwastewaters,EPA is proposing to regulate two specific organic constituents that arenot included on the BDAT List but have been selected as indicators of effectiveincineration of these wastes. A standard for ortho-nitroaniline is proposedfor K101 and a standard for ortho-nitrophenol is proposed for K102. EPA is also proposing to regulate nine metal constituents including antimony,arsenic, barium, cadmium, total chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zincas indicators of effective stabilization of these wastes (based on stabilizationof the ash from incineration). At the time of this proposal, the Agencyhas not completed its evaluation of waste characterization and treatmentdata for antimony, arsenic and barium. Therefore, the Agency is proposingto reserve standards for antimony, arsenic and barium until evaluationcan be completed. The standards for the other metals are transferred fromthe treatment of wastes judged to have similar chemical and physical characteristicsto K101 and K102 incinerator ashes. (ii) <T3>Wastewaters. </T3>For wastes identified as K101 and K102 wastewaters,EPA is proposing to regulate two different organic constituents as indicatorsof effective incineration of these wastes. A standard for ortho-nitroanilineis proposed for K101 and a standard for ortho-nitrophenol is proposed forK102. For wastes identified as K101 or K102 wastewaters, EPA is proposing toregulate five metal constituents from the BDAT List as indicators of effectivetreatment of these wastes. These include antimony, arsenic, cadmium, lead,and mercury. At the time of this proposal, the Agency has not completedits evaluation of waste characterization and treatment data for antimony.Therefore, the Agency is proposing to reserve a standard for antimony untilevaluation can be completed.  <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp9,i1,s10,6.4,6.4 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K101 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Ortho-Nitroaniline <D>14.0 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Antimony <D>(\1\) </D><D>(\2\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic <D>(\1\) </D><D>(\2\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium <D>(\1\) </D><D>(\2\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.066 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>(\1\) </D><D>3.8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.71 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.53 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.31 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zinc <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.086 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable. </F><F>\2\ Reserved.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp9,i1,s10,6.4,6.4 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K101 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Ortho-Nitroaniline <D>0.266 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Antimony <D>(\2\) </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic <D>2.036 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>0.238 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.110 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury <D>0.027 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable </F><F>\2\ Reserved.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp9,i1,s10,6.4,6.4 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K102 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Ortho-Nitrophenol <D>13.3 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Antimony <D>(\1\) </D><D>(\2\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic <D>(\1\) </D><D>(\2\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium <D>(\1\) </D><D>(\2\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.066 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>(\1\) </D><D>3.8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.71 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.53 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.31 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zinc <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.086 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable. </F><F>\2\ Reserved.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp9,i1,s10,6.4,6.4 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K102 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Ortho Nitrophenol <D>0.028 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Antimony <D>(\2\) </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic <D>2.036 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>0.238 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.110 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury <D>0.027 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable. </F><F>\2\ Reserved.</F></ITAG></ITAG> j. K106_Wastewater treatment sludges from the mercury cell process in chlorineproduction. 1. <T3>Industry Affected and Waste Description. </T3>The listed waste K106is generated by facilities in the inorganic chemicals industry (specificallychlorine manufacturing by the mercury cell process). The Agency estimatesthat there are 20 facilities that have specific production processes thatcould potentially generate K106 waste. While these facilities are distributedin just about all regions of the United States, a large proportion of themare located in the Southeast. Chlorine is produced by the electrolytic decomposition of a saturated sodiumchloride brine solution. One type of electrolytic cell uses mercury asan electrode. At such facilities, process wastewaters will contain solubleand elemental mercury. Treatment of this wastewater stream is performedusing chemical precipitation of the mercury (primarily as sulfide) followedby sedimentation or filtration of the precipitates. These residuals arethe listed waste K106. Untreated K106 wastes consist primarily of water (60%), mercury sulfide(3%), other metal sulfides (2%), and diatomaceous earth or other filteraid (35%). K106 wastes are sludges and, for the purposes of BDAT, are classifiedas nonwastewaters. Treatment of K106 results in the generation of solidresiduals (nonwastewaters) and wastewaters. 2. <T3>Applicable/Demonstrated Treatment Technologies. </T3>The Agency hasidentified thermal recovery (retorting) as an applicable technology fornonwastewater K106. Retorting is a metal recovery process, whereby heatis added to volatilize the mercury from the waste. Elemental mercury issubsequently condensed as a reuseable material. The residual waste fromretorting contains significantly lower concentrations of mercury. Retortinghas been demonstrated on K106 at one facility. Retorting is also demonstratedon ores consisting primarily of mercury sulfides that the Agency believeshave chemical and physical characteristics similar to K106 nonwastewaters.Thus, while EPA estimates that there are no facilities currently retortingK106, EPA has identified at least one facility that performs retortingof mercury ores that are comparable to the listed waste. Therefore, theAgency considers that retorting is a demonstrated technology for K106 nonwastewaters.The Agency considered stabilization as an applicable technology and performedtesting on nonwastewater K106. Analyses indicated that no significant reductionin leachability of mercury from the waste was achieved by the stabilizationprocess. Therefore, the Agency concludes that stabilization is not a demonstratedtechnology for this waste. The Agency has identified sulfide precipitation followed by filtrationas an applicable technology for K106 wastewaters. EPA believes that K106wastewaters have similar waste characteristics as wastewater generatedfrom the treatment of K071 (brine purification muds from the mercury cellprocess in chlorine production, where separately prepurified brine is notused). Sulfide precipitation (followed by filtration) of mercury containingwastewaters is demonstrated at nineteen or more facilities. Therefore,the Agency believes that sulfide precipitation is both applicable and demonstratedfor wastewaters generated from treatment of K106 nonwastewaters.3. <T3>Data Base.</T3> The Agency has nine untreated and treated data pointsfrom EPA testing of one facility on treatment of K106 nonwastewaters bystabilization. Data collected during these tests show that these technologieswere properly operated. These data indicated that no significant reductionin leachability was achieved. Therefore, the Agency concluded that stabilizationshould not be considered a demonstrated treatment technology for K106.The Agency has five untreated and treated data points from a literaturesource on the treatment of K106 combined with K071 nonwastewaters usingdewatering followed by retorting. Since the source reports that K106 comprisedonly 0.5% of the feed to the retort furnace, the Agency believes the wastemixture does not sufficiently represent the majority of K106 wastes. Therefore,EPA did not consider these in the development of the BDAT treatment standards.The Agency has seven treated data points from the treatment of K106 byretorting. However, the K106 treated was not generated by the conventionalmethod of sulfide precipitation, but consisted of elemental mercury thatwas concentrated in the residual from membrane filtration of wastewaterfrom the mercury cell process. EPA did not consider these data to be representativeof K106 nonwastewaters because nineteen of the twenty facilities generatingK106 currently generate a mercury sulfide sludge or residual. Therefore,these data were not considered in the development of the BDAT treatmentstandards. As noted previously, the Agency also has data from the retorting of mercurysulfide ores. EPA believes that the similarities in chemical and physicalcomposition of these ores and K106 nonwastewaters are sufficient to allowthe transfer of the retorting performance data. These data were used forthe development of the BDAT treatment standards for K106 nonwastewaters.EPA does not have data on treatment of K106 wastewaters generated as partof the retorting operation. EPA believes that these wastewaters are similarin chemical and physical composition to wastewaters generated in treatmentof K071 by acid leaching. Therefore, EPA has transferred these performancelevels to K106 wastewaters. The data base for K071 wastewaters consistsof three untreated and treated data points using sulfide precipitationfollowed by filtration. All of these data represent a well designed andwell operated system and were used in the development of the BDAT standardsfor K106 wastewaters. 4. <T3>Identification of BDAT.</T3> EPA is proposing to set BDAT standardsfor K106 nonwastewaters based on the performance achieveable by the retortingof mercury sulfide ores. The Agency has determined that this technologyis both demonstrated and available. EPA is proposing to set BDAT standardsfor K106 wastewaters based on sulfide precipitation followed by filtration.The Agency has determined that sulfide precipitation is demonstrated andavailable for wastewaters generated from treatment of K106 nonwastewaters(the sulfide residues must meet the standards for nonwastewaters). Thesetechnologies are judged to be available to treat these wastes because:(1) They are commercially available or can be purchased and (2) they providea substantial reduction in the concentrations of hazardous constituentsthat have to be placed on the land. The question of identifying BDAT for K106 also requires some discussionof several other EPA regulations relating specifically to burning hazardouswastes for materials recovery in industrial furnaces, and relating moregenerally to the issue of when secondary materials are RCRA solid wastesunder such circumstances. The most significant issue presented is whetherEPA may permissibly establish a BDAT treatment standard for the residualwhich results from retorting of this waste. The initial question is whether wastewater treatment sludge from the mercurycell process is a RCRA solid and hazardous waste when it is sent to anindustrial furnace for retorting. Under the Agency's existing regulations,this activity is classified as the type of recycling known as ``reclamation''because it involves recovery of metals contained in the wastewater treatmentsludge (see 40 CFR 261.1(c)(4)). Because the material is a listed sludge,it is therefore defined as a solid waste under 40 CFR 261.2(c)(3). The Agency believes that this is an appropriate classification becausea strong element of waste treatment would characterize this recycling activity(as noted, retorting of K106 is not currently practiced). Storage practicespreceding reclamation of this waste also can involve direct placement onthe land (for instance, in open waste piles), another indication that thewastewater treatment sludge is a waste. For a more detailed discussionsee 50 FR 641 (January 4, 1985) which presents the decision factors todetermine whether sludges and byproducts should be designated as solidwastes when they are to be reclaimed. EPA has recently proposed to codifythese factors, with some modifications, in its regulations (53 FR 519 and529, January 8, 1988). The recent opinion of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appealsin <T3>American Mining Congress v. EPA </T3>(824 F. 2d 1177) does not changethis analysis. The court stated that when a generator has a secondary materialof no further use to him, which he discards by giving to another personfor recycling, the material is a ``discarded material'' within the meaningof RCRA section 1004 (27). An example used in the opinion is used oil givenby the original generator to a second person for recycling (824 F. 2d atn. 14). The wastewater treatment sludge is similarly discarded by the generatorwhen it is no longer useful to the original generator, is given to anotherentity for recycling, and is not recycled in the original process or evenin another chlorine and caustic soda process. Thus, it is not the typeof in-process, undiscarded material used in on-going, continuous processesfound in the <T3>American Mining Congress</T3> case to be an undiscarded material (seegenerally, 53 FR 519, 520-521, and 522-523, January 8, 1988). It should be noted that even if the K106 waste was not deemed to be a wastewhen it is reclaimed in processes unrelated to chlorine production, EPAstill could establish BDAT standards for K106 that is being disposed, orotherwise ensure that the waste is recycled by retorting rather than bybeing land disposed. For example, the Agency could simply prohibit landdisposal of the waste and indicate that retorting is BDAT. The Agency alsocould let the statutory prohibition for the waste take effect, which (asa practical matter) would have the same result. Since the Agency can require recycling as a BDAT standard, it must considerwhether it has authority to set treatment standards for the residuals thatresult from retorting. The fact that K106 is a solid and hazardous wastewhen it is sent for retorting does not end the inquiry. The Agency hasdiscussed in a number of preambles the question of whether a waste destinedfor material recovery in an industrial furnace continues to be a wastewhen it is actually fed into the furnace. The issue arises because industrialfurnaces are normally used as essential components of industrial processes,and when they are actually burning secondary materials for material recoverycan be involved in the very act of production, an activity normally beyondthe Agency's RCRA authority (see 50 FR 630, January 4, 1985; 50 FR 49167,November 24, 1985; and 52 FR 16889-990, May 6, 1987). Accordingly, theAgency has stated that, even when secondary materials sent to be reclaimedin these devices are wastes before they are reclaimed, they cease to bewastes when they are actually placed in the industrial furnace for materialsrecovery. To retain authority over industrial furnaces where waste treatmentis a driving element of the reclamation activity, the Agency has furtherstated that the secondary material being reclaimed in the industrial furnacemust be ``indigenous'' to that furnace for it to cease being a waste. TheAgency has proposed to define ``indigenous'' to be any material generatedby the same type of furnace in which it will be reclaimed (see the proposalin 52 FR 17034, May 6, 1987). The Agency suggested other possible alternativesin the May 6 proposal, including classifying wastes that contained insignificantconcentrations of Appendix VIII constituents in the waste which are notnormally found in the feed material to be indigenous. The K106 sludges would not be considered indigenous, under the May 6 proposal,to the retort furnaces used as the basis for the proposed treatment standard.However, if an alternative such as classifying wastes that contained insignificantconcentrations of other Appendix VIII constituents to be indigenous werefinalized, the waste may not be considered indigenous. The Agency solicitscomments on the similarities of the concentrations of other Appendix VIIIconstituents (other than mercury) that are present in both K106 and themercury ores that are retorted in mining operations.If such a determination of indigenous is made for K106, it would ceaseto be a solid waste when it is retorted. This would mean that the residualsproduced by the furnace during the retorting of the sludge would no longerautomatically be deemed to be a hazardous waste by virtue of the ``derived-from''rule in 40 CFR 261.2(c), because it would no longer derive from treatmentof a listed hazardous waste (the K106 waste would no longer be a hazardouswaste at the moment of burning). Thus, the residual would be a hazardouswaste only if it exhibited a characteristic of a hazardous waste. Dependingupon the type of device doing the retorting, and the feed materials tothat device, the residual might also presently be excluded from regulationas a waste from the mining, beneficiation, or processing of an ore or mineral(see 52 FR 17012, May 6, 1987). Under these circumstances, the Agency probablycould not set treatment standards for the residual which does not exhibita characteristic of hazardous waste, since the land disposal prohibitionsapply only to ``hazardous wastes''. In addition, any prohibition for residualsexhibiting a characteristic of hazardous waste would take effect on May8, 1990, as a third third waste. Thus, although the Agency has proposed treatment standards based on totaland leachable mercury concentrations in the residual, EPA solicits commenton the issues with the view that EPA could establish either ``total recycle''or ``no land disposal'' as the treatment standard for K106 should it determinenot to set treatment standards for the residual. 5. <T3>Regulated Constituents and Treatment Standards.</T3> The proposed regulatedconstituents and BDAT treatment standards for wastes identified as K106are listed in the tables at the end of this section. EPA is proposing thatmercury is the only constituent that needs to be regulated for wastes identifiedas K106. EPA's rationale for selecting mercury is presented in the BDATBackground Document for this waste code. Facilities must comply with thesetreatment standards prior to placement of these wastes in land disposalunits. Those wastes that as generated naturally meet these standards arenot prohibited from disposal in these units. Dilution to achieve thesetreatment standards is forbidden. The treatment standards are based on analyses of total constituent concentrationand leachate from the TCLP for all wastes identified as nonwastewatersand analyses of total constituent concentration for all wastes identifiedas wastewaters. The units of measure for total constituent analyses aremg/kg (or parts per million on a weight by weight basis) for the nonwastewatersand mg/l (or parts per million on a weight by volume basis) for wastewaters.The units of measure for analyses of leachate are mg/l (or parts per millionon a weight by volume basis).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K106 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury<D> 630</D><D> 0.028</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K106 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>   <ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury<D> 0.030</D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> k. Revision of BDAT Treatment Standard for Methylene Chloride in Wastewatersfrom the Pharmaceutical Industry Listed as F001, F002, F003, F004 and /orF005. On November 7, 1986, EPA promulgated treatment standards for regulatedconstituents in F001-F005 spent solvent wastewaters and nonwastewaters.Since that time, EPA has collected additional data on steam stripping ofmethylene chloride in wastewaters at similar concentrations as those wastewatersfrom the pharmaceutical industry. Where EPA has set a treatment standard,it is not precluded from revising that standard after the statutory dateprovided that rulemaking procedures are followed. RCRA section 3004(m)(1)specifically states that treatment standards are to be revised as appropriate.Therefore, in light of the new data collected, EPA is today reproposingthe treatment standard for methylene chloride in F001-F005 wastewatersfrom the pharmaceutical industry. The treatment standards for all otherhazardous constituents in F001-F005 wastewaters, and all hazardous constituentsin F001-F005 nonwastewaters are not being reproposed and therefore remainas promulgated on November 7, 1986 (51 FR 40572). The Agency also is notreproposing the standard for methylene chloride in F001-F005 wastewatersother than those from the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. EPA established two separate waste treatability groups for wastewaters:Methylene chloride in F001-F005 wastewaters from the pharmaceuticals manufacturingindustry and all other F001-F005 wastewaters containing methylene chloride.A BDAT treatment standard of 12.7 mg/1 was promulgated for methylene chloridein wastewaters in the pharmaceuticals manufacturing industry treatabilitygroup, based on the performance data for steam stripping. A BDAT treatmentstandard of 0.20 mg/1 was promulgated for all other F001-F005 wastewaterscontaining methylene chloride, based on performance data for biologicaltreatment. BDAT for methylene chloride in wastewaters from the pharmaceutical industryhas been confirmed to be steam stripping. Data was obtained from the treatmentof wastewaters with influent concentrations of methylene chloride thatare similar to the influent concentrations in wastewaters from the pharmaceuticalindustry. The Agency has determined that the wastewaters that were tested,are in the same treatability group as the wastewaters from the pharmaceuticalindustry and is transferring the data and standards to the pharmaceuticalindustry. The Agency is aware of at least two facilities that use steam strippingto treat methylene chloride in wastewater. EPA has determined that steamstripping is demonstrated to treat F001-F005. Steam stripping is judgedto be available to treat these wastewaters because: (1) Steam strippingis commercially available or can be purchased and (2) steam stripping providesa substantial reduction in the concentration of methylene chloride in F001-F005wastewaters from the pharmaceutical industry. The revised BDAT treatment standard proposed for methylene chloride inwastewaters identified as F001, F002, F003, F004 and/or F005 from the pharmaceuticalsindustry is listed in the table at the end of this section. (Note thatthe proposed treatment standard is reflected in the regulations by amendingandSection; 268.41 by removing methylene chloride (from the pharmaceuticalindustry) and its corresponding concentration, and adding the revised treatmentstandard in andSection; 268.43.) Facilities must comply with this treatmentstandard prior to placement of these wastes in land disposal units. Thosewastes that as generated naturally meet these standards are not prohibitedfrom disposal in these units. Dilution to achieve these treatment standardsis forbidden. The treatment standard is based on analysis of total constituentconcentration and is expressed in mg/l (or parts per million on a weightby volume basis). The data and analyses used to develop this standard have been placed inthe docket for today's proposed rule and are available as an addendum tothe background document for the final rule for F001-F005 solvent wastes.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>F001, F002, F003, F004, <T4>and </T4>F005 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters; pharmaceuticals industry subcategory]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Methylene chloride <D>0.44</D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> l.

Based on available information, the Agency believes that these wastes areno longer generated, and therefore, are not currently being land disposed.EPA solicits comment to the contrary. The Agency is prohibiting land disposalof these wastes. This approach ensures that these wastes will not be landdisposed in the future. The proposed treatment standard for these wastes is ``No Land Disposal,''allowing for the possibility that these wastes may be generated at a CERCLAsite or during a corrective action at a RCRA facility and may require avariance from the treatment standard.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0,,),p0,7/8,i1,s20 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K021, K025, <T4>and </T4>K060 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters and Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1> </H1>  <ITAG tagnum="21">No Land Disposal.</ITAG></ITAG>m. K044_Wastewater treatment sludges from the manufacturing and processingof explosives. K045_Spent carbon from the treatment of wastewater containing explosives.K047_Pink/red water from TNT operations. EPA has determined that a proposed standard of ``No Land Disposal'' isappropriate for K044, K045, and K047 wastes. This determination is basedon the fact that open burning and open detonation of reactive wastes isnot considered land disposal. So long as no reactive constituents remainafter detonation, there would be no land disposal of a hazardous waste(40 CFR 261.3(a)(2)(iii)). EPA's listing of K044, K045, and K047 was based solely on the potentialof these wastes to explode. The Agency does not have any data to suggestthat any hazardous residuals are present following open burning or opendetonation. However, EPA solicits comments providing data that show thepresence of BDAT List constituents in treatable concentrations in residualsfrom managing these wastes in this manner. In the absence of such data, EPA concludes that the current practices ofopen burning and open detonation provide complete destruction of the hazardouscomponents of K044, K045, and K047 and subsequent land disposal of residualsis unnecessary. Therefore, EPA is proposing ``No Land Disposal'' as therequirement for these wastes. This standard is consistent with EPA's generalapproach in that the standard provides a significant reduction in the hazardpresented by these wastes and is based on demonstrated and available technology.EPA recognizes alternative technologies, such as incineration in speciallydesigned units, is being investigated for wastes similar to K044, K045,and K047. By establishing a treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal''rather than allowing the statutory bans to take effect, a petition fora variance from the standard can be submitted to the Agency for evaluation.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0,,),i1,s25 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K044, K045, <T4>and </T4>K047 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters and Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1> </H1>  <ITAG tagnum="21">[No Land Disposal]</ITAG></ITAG> n.

All remaining ``First Third'' wastes originally listed under andSection;261.33 (e) and (f) (i.e., those beginning with a ``P'' or ``U''). The Agency has not completed its evaluation of BDAT for these wastes andis not proposing treatment standards at this time. Therefore, the Agencywill not promulgate standards for these wastes by their statutory deadlineof August 8, 1988. RCRA section 3004(g)(6) (42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(6)) providesthat if EPA fails to set treatment standards for any hazardous waste includedin the schedule promulgated on May 28, 1986 (51 FR 19300) by the statutorydeadline, such waste may be land disposed in a landfill or surface impoundmentonly if the facility meets certain statutory requirements and only untilMay 8, 1990. These requirements have been termed the ``soft hammer'' provisions.Wastes identified as K011, K013, and/or K014 are wastes generated fromthe production of acrylonitrile. Information supplied by industry tradeassociations indicate that many of the facilities are combining K011 andK013 and removing filterable solid materials prior to disposal of the filtratein underground injection wells. The filtered K011 and K013 residues areoften combined with K014 and incinerated in a hazardous waste incinerator.The Agency anticipates that many facilities will submit petitions for evaluationof ``no migration'' from these underground injection units into which filtratesof K011 and K013 are being injected. At this time, EPA has not completedits investigation of the incineration of the filtered residuals nor hasit evaluated a ``no migration'' petition specific to these waste codes.EPA anticipates that it will establish treatment standards based on analysisof the performance of incineration or based on an extrapolation of datafor wastes with similar physical and chemical characteristics. This investigationof K011, K013, and K014 will not be completed in time for proposal andpromulgation by the statutory deadline of August 8, 1988. Therefore, untilEPA promulgates treatment standards (and until May 8, 1990), the ``softhammer'' provisions would apply to these wastes if they are placed in landdisposal units. Finally, EPA notes that many of these wastes, when existing as untreatedwastes, are already prohibited from land disposal because they are CaliforniaList wastes. The liquid cyanide wastes, for example, could exceed the statutoryprohibition levels for cyanide. Several of the organic hazardous wastesundoubtably exceed the statutory levels for wastes containing halogenatedorganics (HOC wastes). To the extent that these wastes are prohibited underthe California List rule (52 FR 25773, July 8, 1987) or statutory provisions(RCRA section 3004(d)(2)) and also fall under the soft hammer, the CaliforniaList prohibitions and treatment standards (if any) apply. Thus, for example,any prohibited HOC wastes that also are First Third ``soft hammer'' wasteswould have to be incinerated before land disposal. o. Burning in Industrial Boilers and Industrial Furnaces as BDAT for HOC's.EPA has also decided to repropose for additional comment a notice thatappeared in the May 6, 1987, proposed rule on boilers and industrial furnacesburning hazardous wastes. 52 FR 17021. This proposal would have allowedburning in industrial boilers and furnaces to be considered BDAT for CaliforniaList HOCs. Although most of the comments supported this approach, EPA issoliciting further comment. We note that this rule might become effectivea short time before final permitting and interim status standards for emissionsfrom these devices become effective (current schedules call for the boilerand industrial furnace rules to be promulgated early in 1989). EPA is tentativelyprepared to accept this possibility because these devices are likely tobe operated efficiently so as to achieve substantial destruction of theHOCs in the waste. This is because industrial boilers and industrial furnaceshave a commercial purpose which requires relatively efficient burning (seeandSection; 260.10 definitions of ``boiler'' and ``industrial furnace'' whichrequire, for boilers, energy recovery efficiency of 60 percent and 75 percentexport and utilization of recovered energy, and, for industrial furnaces,that the device be an integral part of a manufacturing process). In addition,non-industrial boilers, some of which might be expected to destroy HOCsless efficiently, are essentially prohibited from burning hazardous wasteat all. Section 266.31(b). The rule as proposed would amend andSection; 268.42(a)(2) to say that boilersand industrial furnaces burning in accordance with applicable regulatorystandards could burn HOCs. When Part 266 standards exist for these devices,the devices thus must meet these standards. Until then, they would haveto meet other applicable Federal, state, and local standards.11. Requirement that Hazardous Waste Derived Products Used in a MannerConstituting Disposal Meet BDAT in Order to Remain Exempt from RegulationUnder the Agency's rules, hazardous secondary materials being used in amanner constituting disposal are defined as solid and hazardous wastes.40 CFR 261.2(c)(1). Examples are use of hazardous waste as dust suppressants,road base material, or fertilizers. Products produced from hazardous secondarymaterials, which are placed on or applied to the land, are likewise definedas solid and hazardous wastes (assuming the waste-derived product remainshazardous, per the definitions in andSection; 261.3). 40 CFR 261.2(c)(1)(B).If the hazardous waste component has ``undergone a chemical reaction inthe course of producing the product so as to become inseparable by physicalmeans'', then such waste-derived products used in a manner constitutingdisposal are not presently subject to federal regulation. 40 CFR 266.20(b).Commercial waste-derived fertilizers are likewise presently exempt fromFederal Subtitle C regulation. The question we are addressing here_andalso addressed in a more specific content for waste-derived fertilizersproduced from waste K061 in the April 8, 1988 proposed rule_is whetherwaste-derived products whose placement on the land is presently exemptfrom Federal regulation should be allowed to be placed on the land if theydon't meet the BDAT treatment standards for each prohibited hazardous wastethat they contain. The Agency is proposing to qualify the exemption from regulation for hazardouswaste-derived products that are used in a manner constituting disposal(andSection; 266.20(b)) to provide that such waste-derived products mustmeet any (and all) applicable treatment standard(s) in Subpart D of Part268 for the waste. The Agency believes that this approach is warrantedfor the following reasons. First, this type of use constituting disposal consists of placing wastesdirectly on the land, a form of land disposal under section 3004(k). Underthe land disposal prohibition program, untreated hazardous wastes are notto be placed directly on the land (i.e., land disposed) except in ``nomigration'' units. Second, the Agency (with few exceptions) has not evaluated whether theplacement of hazardous waste-derived products on the land is safe. TheAgency has merely deferred regulation while it studies the problem to determinean appropriate regulatory regime. See 50 FR 646-647 (January 4, 1985).Thus, continuation of the current exemption from regulation in andSection;266.20(b) appears to directly thwart the policy, and indeed the expresscommand, of the land disposal prohibition statutory provisions. There isnot even a countervailing environmental objective at stake since the Agencyhas no data demonstrating the safety of most of these practices. Indeed,the existing exemption in andSection; 266.20(b) may create an incentive toavoid treatment (or to avoid BDAT-level treatment) and to utilize thisform of disposal instead. It consequently appears to the Agency that allhazardous waste-derived products, in order to be exempt from regulationwhen they are placed on the land, should have to meet any applicable treatmentstandard for the waste established in Subpart D of Part 268. At that point,even though hazardous wastes were being placed on the land, they at leastwould be meeting the treatment standard required for all other wastes ofthe same type. The Agency consequently solicits comment on whether the existing exemptionin andSection; 266.20(b) should be conditioned by requiring that any suchwaste-derived product meet applicable treatment standards. EPA notes furtherthat if the Agency adopts this proposal, it would not necessarily be findingthat further regulation of this type of use constituting disposal is unnecessary,or finding that use constituting disposal of waste-derived products thatmeet the treatment standard is necessarily safe. Disposal of hazardouswaste would still be occurring in unregulated units. Rather, this typeof placement on the land would at least be meeting the minimum statutoryrequirements in section 3004 (d), (e), (g) and (m). In order to implement this type of requirement, the Agency would need tohave some type of tracking scheme in place, and some means for personsproducing waste-derived products to demonstrate that they are meeting theapplicable treatment standard. Of course, hazardous wastes utilized toproduce waste-derived products that are used in a manner constituting disposalare already subject to regulation until the waste-derived product is produced,and so are subject to andSection; 268.7 tracking controls (as well as theother applicable Subtitle C requirements) until that point. The issueson which we are soliciting comment are how should the producer documentthat the waste-derived product meets BDAT_for instance, is there any reasonnot to follow the testing procedures in andSection; 268.7(b)_and whetherany further tracking to the ultimate user (as occurs normally under andSection;268.7(b) (1) and (2)) is needed. Finally, the Agency reiterates that there does not appear to be any questionthat waste-derived products that are placed on the land are ``solid wastes''under RCRA. Nothing in <T3>American Mining Congress </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>824 F. 1177 (D.C. Cir. 1987) is to the contrary. The hazardouswastes in the waste-derived product are being gotten rid of by disposingof them, and so are being discarded. See generally, 53 FR 521-522 (January8, 1988), and underlying record materials. The following examples show how the Agency envisions the proposal wouldoperate. 1. A generator generates a listed wastewater treatment sludge which isprohibited from land disposal and for which the Agency has establishedtreatment standards. The sludge is combined with virgin materials in away that causes the hazardous waste to undergo a chemical reaction so asnot to be separable from the product matrix by physical means. The waste-derivedproduct is then sold to the public as road base material. Assuming that the activity is not sham recycling (i.e., that the listedhazardous waste and its hazardous constituents really contribute legitimatelyto the waste's use as road base material), then the waste-derived productwould have to meet the BDAT standard for the listed hazardous waste orit could not legally be placed on the land. The generator of the productalso would have to document that the waste-derived product meets the treatmentstandard. 2. An aggregate kiln burns a variety of prohibited hazardous wastes generatedby other generators along with virgin materials to generate waste-derivedaggregate, which is sold to the general public for direct placement onthe land. Assuming that the activity is not sham recycling (i.e., that the prohibitedhazardous wastes and their hazardous constituents do contribute legitimatelyto producing aggregate), then the aggregate would have to meet the treatmentstandard for <T3>each </T3>prohibited hazardous waste that it contains. The kiln operatorwould also have to document that each batch meets these standards.<ITAG tagnum="81">12. Corrections to the April 8, 1988 Proposal (53 FR 11742) </ITAG>Although there were several typographical and editorial errors in the April8, 1988 proposal, this preamble section addresses only the most pertinent.First, on page 11770 of the April 8th proposal, the Agency discusses theavailability of the 2-year nationwide variance for solvent wastes whichcontain less than one percent total F001-F005 solvent constituents. Althoughthe Agency did not propose to change its approach from the existing regulationin andSection; 268.30(a)(3), EPA stated that it was proposing regulatorylanguage and soliciting comment on this approach. The Agency, however,inadvertently neglected to include the proposed regulatory language. Today'sproposed regulatory language corrects this oversight by proposing the existingregulatory language, as discussed in the April 8th preamble. Second, an error was made in identifying a hazardous constituent for K103and K104 wastes in both the preamble and in the regulatory language. Onpages 11758 and 11790 of the April 8 proposal, the treatment standard tablesfor nonwastewater and wastewater K103 and K104 list 2,3-dinitrophenol.The actual constituent, however, is 2,4-dinitrophenol, as stated in thebackground document for these wastes. Also, regarding the regulatory textfor K103 and K104 nonwastewaters on page 11790, an error was made in statingthe total composition levels for aniline, nitrobenzene, and phenol. Thecorrect level, 5.44 mg/kg, is correctly stated in the preamble discussionon page 11758. Although the BDAT background document supports these corrections,anyone confused by this may submit further comment addressing the point.Third, on pages 11763 and 11791 of the April 8 proposal, the concentrationlevel for toluene in K015 waste is stated incorrectly. The tables in thepreamble and regulatory language for K015 list the total composition levelfor toluene as 1.00 mg/l. The actual value, as stated in and supportedby the background documents is 0.148 mg/l. Even though the treatment standardis stated correctly in the background document, anyone confused by theApril 8 preamble may submit comment on the toluene treatment standard upuntil the date for comment on this proposed rule. Fourth, on page 11789 of the April 8 proposal, an error was made in theheadings for the treatment standard tables for K016 and K018 wastes (the``wastewater'' tables are incorrectly labeled as second ``nonwastewater''tables). These tables are correctly labeled in the preamble discussionon page 11756. Also, on page 11762 the second and third tables in the firstcolumn are incorrectly labeled K050 wastes. These tables actually presentthe treatment standards for K051 wastes, as is correctly stated in theregulatory language. The Agency will accept further comment on this issuefrom anyone confused by these corrections. Fifth, the tables for K019 wastewater and nonwastewater, and K020 nonwastewateron page 11756 incorrectly state the hazardous constituent tetrachloroetheneas tetrachloroethane. The constituent is, however, correctly stated inthe regulatory language. Sixth, in the preamble for K016 wastewater on page 11756 and in the regulatorytext for K030 wastewater on page 11790, the total composition treatmentstandard for hexachloroethane is incorrect. The correct treatment standardis 0.033 mg/l, as supported by the background document. EPA will acceptcomment on these corrections from anyone confused by the change throughoutthe comment period on this proposed rule. Finally, EPA neglected to include a hazardous constituent in the preambletable for K019 nonwastewaters on page 11756. This constituent, chlorobenzene(with a total composition treatment standard of 5.66 mg/kg), is correctlyincluded in the regulatory text and is supported by the background document.B. Determination and Measurement of Applicable Treatment Standards <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relationship to Restrictions on California List Wastes </ITAG>Certain First Third wastes having proposed treatment standards and prohibitioneffective dates are also California list wastes. The California list coversa broad group of corrosive wastes and specific metal-, cyanide-, and halogenatedorganic-containing wastes, for which EPA has promulgated treatment standardsand/or effective dates in the July 8, 1987 rule (52 FR 25760). Once thestandards and dates proposed today are finalized, they supersede the applicableCalifornia list waste treatment standards and effective dates. Under 40CFR 268.32(h) this interpretation, pursuant to which a waste-specific determinationsupplants a California list waste determination, has been applied to solvent-and dioxin-containing wastes which have treatment standards and effectivedates and are California list wastes. The April 8, 1988, rule (53 FR 11742) proposed a reading different fromthat stated above for First Third wastes which have waste-specific treatmentstandards and are also California list wastes, but for which, due to asignificant shortage of alternative capacity, the Agency grants a nationalvariance from the effective date. EPA solicited comment on an approachwhere, for these wastes, the applicable California list waste treatmentstandards and effective dates would remain in effect, superseding the waste-specificdeterminations for the duration of the variance. This rule also proposedthat First Third wastes for which the Agency has not set treatment standardsand effective dates by August 8, 1988 (wastes covered by the ``soft hammer''requirements), are subject to any applicable California list waste treatmentstandards and effective dates. Comments addressing these proposed interpretationsare also requested here. C. Proposed Approach To Comparative Risk Assessment Within the regulatory framework established for implementing the land disposalrestrictions, EPA included certain criteria in the determination of ``available''treatment technologies. One criterion required that treatment technologiesnot present greater total risks than land disposal waste management practices.See 51 FR 40592-40593 (November 7, 1986). Although the Agency conductedcomparative risk assessments in the development of regulations prohibitingland disposal of certain spent solvent and dioxin-containing hazardouswastes (November 7, 1986 final rule) and California list wastes (July 8,1987 final rule), the analyses did not affect the determinations that treatmentwas available. Upon further consideration of the existing comparative risk analysis, theAgency has decided not to utilize comparative risk assessment in this rulemakingbecause it is problematic. In cases where the land disposal practice couldbe found to be less risky than any of the treatment alternatives, the analysiscould lead to anomalous results. For example, in situations where the comparativerisk analysis indicated that land disposal was the least risky alternativeavailable, there would be no specified treatment technology for the wastes.At the same time, land disposal would be prohibited by statute. Thus, thegenerator could not treat or land dispose the wastes, even though treatmentcould be conducted pursuant to other regulatory standards that assure protectionof human health and the environment. A second anomaly is that unless EPA actually specifies a treatment methodas the treatment standard_normally an undesirable option (see 51 FR 44725,December 11, 1986)_the regulated community may still use treatment technologiesidentified as riskier than land disposal to comply with the treatment standards.In this respect, the comparative risk assessments would not deter the useof treatment found to present greater total risk. In light of these considerations, EPA has not used the existing comparativerisk assessment approach in this proposal and is reconsidering its applicationas a decision tool in future rulemakings in the determination of ``available''treatment technologies. In the future the Agency may conduct risk analysesto distinguish between the overall degree of risk posed by alternativetreatment technologies and to make determinations concerning the ``best''technology based on net risk posed by the alternative practices. In theApril 8, 1988 proposal the Agency solicited comment on this new approach.D. Determination of Alternative Capacity and Effective Dates for FirstThird Wastes <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Capacity Data Base and Methodology </ITAG>EPA has developed a new data base for capacity analyses. This data baseis comprised of information from responses to the National Survey of HazardousWaste Treatment, Storage, Disposal and Recycling Facilities (the TSDR Survey).EPA conducted the TSDR Survey during 1987 and early 1988. One major objectiveof the survey was to obtain comprehensive data on hazardous waste managementcapacity and on volumes of hazardous waste being land disposed. The TSDRSurvey was sent to all RCRA permitted or RCRA interim status facilitiesthat have or plan to have treatment, disposal or recycling capabilities.The TSDR Survey was also sent to a statistical sample of facilities thathave only storage. This new data base is the primary source of data forevaluation of capacity for this rule, with supplemental data used as needed.(See the <T3>Background Document for First Third Wastes to Support 40 CFR Part 268Land Disposal Restrictions, Part II., </T3>referred to hereafter as the``Capacity Background Document,'' for a complete description of the TSDRSurvey data set and other supplemental data.) The general approach for capacity analyses for this rule is similar tothat used for the past land disposal restrictions rules, but the new dataset provides for more comprehensive analyses. Major changes in the capacitymethodology include an analysis of volumes being treated in surface impoundmentsthat meet the minimum technology requirements, an analysis of planned closureof surface impoundments through replacement with tanks, and an analysisof the sequences of management processes that minimizes the possibilityof double counting. (See the Capacity Background Document for a detaileddescription of the capacity data set and methodology.) <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Capacity Analysis of First Third Wastes, Solvent Wastes, CaliforniaList Wastes, and Soil and Debris </ITAG>The following discussion presents EPA's capacity analyses for the FirstThird wastes for which EPA is proposing treatment standards. These analyseswere performed using the new TSDR Survey data. EPA is also presenting updatedcapacity analyses for the wastes addressed in the Proposed First ThirdRule on April 8, 1988 (53 FR 11742). The Agency explained in this recentnotice that the new TSDR Survey data would be used to reassess availabletreatment capacity for those wastes as soon as it was available (see 53FR 11742). Section III.E briefly covers new capacity analyses of waste volumes requiringalternative capacity pursuant to the Solvents Rule (51 FR 40572) and theCalifornia List Rule (52 FR 25760). Section III.F presents our analysisof soil and debris wastes. These waste volumes are not included in theanalyses of the First Third wastes. However, it is important to note thatthe discussion of capacity available for treating First Third wastes doesreflect only the amount of available capacity remaining after accountingfor the treatment of wastes restricted from land disposal under the SolventsRule and HOCs under the California List Rule. a. <T3>Total Quantity of Land Disposed First Third Wastes.</T3> EPA has estimatedthe total quantities of all of the scheduled First Third wastes that areland disposed annually based on the results of the TSDR Survey. These wastequantities, and the methods by which the wastes are stored, treated, anddisposed, are presented in the table below. Underground injection, onemethod of land disposal, is not included, but will be addressed in a separaterulemaking. Other methods of land disposal that are affected by today'sproposal (e.g., utilization of salt dome and salt bed formations and undergroundmines and caves) are not addressed in the capacity analyses because ofinsufficient data.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,0,0),p0,7/8,i1,s25,10 </C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4> Total Volume of Land Disposed First Third Wastes </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Million gallons/year]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1> </H1> Storage: <ITAG tagnum="2">Waste piles<D> 48 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Surface impoundments<D> 6 </D></ITAG>Treatment: <ITAG tagnum="2">Waste piles<D> 29 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Surface impoundments<D> 612 </D></ITAG>Disposal: <ITAG tagnum="2">Landfills<D> 303 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Land treatment<D> 77 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Surface impoundments<D> 78</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total</ITAG><D> 1,153</D></ITAG> About 78 million gallons of First Third wastes are disposed of in surfaceimpoundments annually. Ultimately, all of this waste will require alternativetreatment capacity. Approximately 6 million gallons of First Third wastesare stored in surface impoundments annually. Since storage means a temporarycontainment of waste, EPA has assumed that stored wastes are eventuallytreated, recycled or permanently disposed of in other units. To avoid doublecounting (i.e., counting them once when they are stored and then againwhen they are finally disposed of) of such wastes, the volumes of wastesreported as being stored in surface impoundments were not included in theestimates of volumes requiring alternative treatment capacity. However,the Agency recognizes that these wastes will eventually require alternativestorage capacity because of the restrictions on placement of wastes intosurface impoundments. In addition to the wastes stored and disposed in surface impoundments,about 612 million gallons of First Third wastes are treated annually insurface impoundments that do not meet the minimum technology standardsor are residuals that have been removed from those surface impoundmentsthat do meet the minimum technology standards. Additionally, about 48 milliongallons were stored in waste piles, 29 million gallons were treated inwaste piles, and 380 million gallons were disposed of by landfill and landtreatment.

Waste streams were characterized on the basis of land disposalmethod, waste code, and physical/chemical form. Using this information,the Agency then determined which treatment technologies are applicableto the waste volumes and placed the wastes into treatability groups (groupsof wastes for which proposed treatment standards are based on the sametechnology). Finally, EPA determined the volumes of alternative treatmentcapacity that would be required when owners/operators comply with the landdisposal restrictions being proposed today. Based on this analysis, the Agency estimates that today's proposed rulecould potentially affect about 833 million gallons of First Third wastesthat are land disposed annually. Of this total, about 789 million gallonswill require alternative treatment capacity (the remainder is stored).As explained elsewhere in this preamble, EPA is proposing treatment standardsthat are expressed as concentration limits and is identifying the technologybasis of the standards (the Best Demonstrated Available Technology or BDAT).EPA is not requiring that the specified treatment technologies be usedto comply with the standards, but these technologies, as described below(Section III.D.3), were generally used as the basis for determining availablecapacity. The volumes of First Third wastes that require alternative treatment/recyclingcapacity are presented in Table 4. This table includes only the quantitiesof wastes that require alternative commercial capacity; the volumes givendo not include wastes that can be treated on-site by the generator. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,9 </C><T4>Table </T4>4._<T4>Required Alternative Commercial Treatment/Recycling Capacity for FirstThird Wastes Being Proposed Today </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Million gallons/year] </ITAG><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>Required capacity</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">F006 <D>126.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K001 <D>2.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K021 <D>\1\ 0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K022 <D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K025 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K044 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K045 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K046 <D>1.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K047 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K060 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K083 <D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K086 <D>0.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K087 <D>1.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K099 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K101/102 <D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K106 <D>0.4 </D><F>\1\ See section III.D.3 for a discussion of wastes not requiring alternativetreatment capacity.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,10 </C><T4>Table </T4>5._<T4>Required Alternative Commercial Treatment/Recycling Capacity for FirstThird Wastes Proposed April 8, 1988 </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Million gallons/year] </ITAG><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>Required capacity</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">K004 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K008 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K015 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K016 <D>0.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K018 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K019 <D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K020 <D>andless;0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K024 <D>0.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K030 <D>andless;0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K036 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K037 <D>andless;0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K048 <D>37.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K049 <D>31.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K050 <D>11.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K051 <D>78.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K052 <D>12.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K061 <D>82.8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K062 <D>40.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K069 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K071 <D>3.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K073 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K100 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K103 <D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K104 <D>andless;0.1  </D><F>See Section III D.3 for a discussion of wastes not requiring alternativetreatment capacity.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Capacity Currently Available and Effective Dates </ITAG>The table below also presents the volumes of First Third wastes that requirealternative treatment capacity, but, in this case, the volumes are givenaccording to the technology description of the type of alternative treatmentrequired. This table also presents the amount of capacity that is availablein each case. It is important to note that the volumes given for each treatability grouprepresent figures derived by summing volumes reported as land disposedin the TSDR Survey for each waste code. Some of these wastes, because oftheir actual physical form, cannot meet treatment standards simply by usingthe technology designated as BDAT (e.g., a waste in the form of a sludgecannot undergo liquid injection incineration, even though this may havebeen identified as BDAT for a particular waste code). These wastes mustbe treated through several steps, called a treatment train (in the examplegiven, the sludge would require de-watering and possibly other types oftreatment before the residuals could undergo incineration). EPA has assumedthat the residuals in such cases will be treated using alternative technologiesprior to land disposal and, therefore, EPA has assigned the total volumesreported to appropriate technologies.

Using the new TSDR survey data, the Agency has evaluatedcommercial capacity and has determined that there is ample capacity availableto treat these wastes (approximately 246 million gallons). Thus, EPA doesnot propose to grant a capacity variance for K015, K083, or K086 wastes.<T3>Solid/Sludge Incineration Capacity. </T3>EPA estimates that about 157million gallons per year of First Third wastes would require solid/sludgeincineration capacity as a result of the treatment standards proposed todayand on April 8, 1988. Treatment standards for the wastes K001, K016, K019,K020, K022, K024, K030, K037, K048-K052, K087, K101 and K102 are basedon solid/sludge incineration. Using the new TSDR Survey data, the Agency has evaluated commercial capacityand has determined that there is only about 7 million gallons of solid/sludgeincineration capacity available. Therefore, EPA proposes to grant a two-yearnational capacity variance from the effective date for the wastes K048-K052.The total volume for these wastes dominates the analysis. If they are granteda variance, all of the remaining wastes in this treatability group maybe treated. As explained previously, contaminated soil and debris wastes are not includedin this section of the preamble, but are discussed in section III.F. However,note that this discussion of incineration capacity demonstrates that thereis insufficient commercially available treatment capacity for certain contaminatedsoils that would require solids incineration to comply with the land disposalrestriction standards. <T3>Stabilization. </T3>EPA estimates that about 145 million gallons peryear of First Third wastes would require stabilization capacity as a resultof the treatment standards proposed today and on April 8, 1988. Treatmentstandards for the wastes F006 and K046 are based on stabilization. Using the new TSDR survey data, the Agency has evaluated commercial capacityand has determined that there is more than enough capacity available totreat these wastes (approximately 427 million gallons). Therefore, theAgency does not propose to grant a capacity variance to wastes for whichtreatment standards are based on stabilization. <T3>Mercury Retorting and High Temperature Metals Recovery. </T3>EPA estimatesthat less than one million gallons of First Third wastes would requiremercury retorting and about 83 million gallons would require high temperaturemetals recovery capacity per year as a result of the treatment standardsproposed today and on April 8, 1988. Treatment standards for the wastesK061 and K106 are based on high temperature metals recovery and mercuryretorting, respectively. Using the new TSDR survey data, the Agency has evaluated commercial capacityand has determined that there is not enough capacity available to treatK061 or K106. Therefore, EPA proposes to grant a 2-year national capacityvariance from the ban effective date for these wastes. <T3>Wastewater Treatment. </T3>EPA estimates that less than 43 milliongallons per year of First Third waste would require various types of wastewatertreatment as a result of the treatment standards proposed today and onApril 8, 1988. (See Table 6 for descriptions of the various types of wastewatertreatment.) Treatment standards for the waste K062 are based on wastewatertreatment (chromium reduction, chemical precipitation and filtration).Using the new TSDR survey data, the Agency has evaluated commercial capacityand has determined that there is adequate capacity available for wastewatertreatment. Therefore, the Agency does not propose to grant a capacity variancefor K062.<T3>Sludge Treatment. </T3>EPA estimates that about four million gallonsper year of First Third wastes would require sludge treatment as a resultof the treatment standards proposed today and on April 8, 1988. Treatmentstandards for the waste K071 are based on sludge treatment (acid leaching,chemical oxidation, and sulfide precipitation and filtration). After analyzing the new TSDR Survey data, the Agency has determined thatthere is not enough treatment capacity commercially available to treatK071. Therefore, EPA proposes to grant a 2-year national capacity variancefrom the ban effective date to K071. <T3>Wastes for Which Treatment Standards Are Based on Solvent Recoveryor Solvent Extraction. </T3>Proposed treatment standards for the wastesK103 and K104 are based on solvent recovery. BDAT for K103 is solvent extraction,followed by steam stripping, followed by carbon adsorption, followed bycarbon regeneration. BDAT for K104 is solvent extraction followed by liquidincineration and followed by steam stripping, followed by carbon adsorption,followed by carbon regeneration. Using the new TSDR Survey data, EPA has determined that the only volumesof these wastes that require alternative commercial capacity are thosenot amenable to solvent recovery or solvent extraction because of theirphysical forms. Therefore, the Agency has assumed that the K103 and K104wastes requiring alternative treatment will undergo incineration, followedby stabilization of the ash. Again, the Agency believes that this treatmentcan achieve the standard and the volumes of K103 and K104 requiring alternativetreatment have been included in the incineration and stabilization totalspresented in Table 6. <T3>Wastes Not Requiring Alternative Capacity. </T3>After reviewing thenew TSDR Survey, EPA has determined that many First Third wastes do notrequire alternative capacity, even though treatment standards are beingproposed. These wastes are: K021, K025, K044, K045, K047, K060, K099, K004,K008, K015, K018, K036, K069, K073, and K100. Each of these is discussedbelow. Proposed treatment standards for K044, K045 and K047 wastes are based onopen detonation, for which there is no capacity constraint provided theresiduals are not hazardous. The Agency believes that when open detonationis properly conducted, no reactive residues remain and the residuals exhibitno other characteristic. Therefore, no K044, K045, or K047 would requirealternative commercial capacity and no further analysis is necessary. Proposed treatment standards for the First Third waste K099 are based onchlorine oxidation. The Agency has determined that this waste is only beinggenerated at one facility, and that the generator is able to treat thewaste on-site. Therefore, no volumes were reported as requiring alternativecommercial capacity and no further analysis is necessary. Proposed treatment standards for the First Third waste K015 are based onliquid incineration and standards for waste K018 are based on solid/sludgeincineration. However, after analyzing the new TSDR Survey data EPA hasdetermined that neither of these wastes requires alternative treatmentcapacity. There are several possible explanations for this. First, it ispossible that all of these wastes now being generated are being treatedon-site, and do not require commercial capacity. Second, it is possiblethat these wastes are simply not being land disposed or are being landdisposed by a method either not covered in the TSDR Survey or not includedin the proposed rule (e.g., the wastes may be land disposed in an undergroundmine or may be deep-well injected). Finally, the waste may not have requiredalternative capacity in 1986, the reporting date covered by the TSDR Survey.Proposed treatment standards for the First Third waste K069 are based ontotal recycle; this waste cannot be land disposed. Available informationshows that all K069 wastes currently being generated are now being recycledand that no land disposal is occurring. Thus, this waste does not requirealternative capacity. The Agency has determined that several First Third wastes are no longerbeing generated. The treatment standards for these wastes are ``no landdisposal.'' These wastes are: K021, K025, K060, K004, K008, K036, K073,and K100. Since none of these wastes were reported as being land disposedin the TSDR Survey, no further capacity analysis was required. Finally, EPA notes that these new TSDR data have implications for softhammer certifications. EPA will be very skeptical about and will probablyinvalidate any soft hammer certification for a waste amenable to treatmentby a treatment method for which ample capacity is now known to exist. Examplesare any waste amenable to liquid injection incineration or to stabilization.E. Alternative Capacity and Effective Dates for Solvent Wastes and CaliforniaList Wastes Using the new capacity data, EPA has reevaluated waste volumes requiringalternative capacity because of the Solvents Rule (51 FR 40572) and theCalifornia List HOC rule (52 FR 25760). As described above, the new analysisindicated significant changes in waste management practices and capacity,including significant increases in incineration capacity. Consequently,some national capacity variances are no longer necessary. Specifically,capacity variances are no longer needed for: (1) Solvents (F001-F005) generatedby small quantity generators, CERCLA response action and RCRA correctiveaction sites addressed in andSection; 268.30(a) (1) and (2) (except solventcontaminated soils) and for (2) California List HOCs (except HOC soils).The BDAT treatment for these wastes is incineration, and the new capacitydata indicate significant increases in incineration capacity, assuringadequate capacity for these wastes (See Table 6).F. National Variance From the Effective Date for Contaminated Soils <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Legal Authority </ITAG>Under RCRA sections 3004 (d)(3) and (e)(3), Congress provided that theland disposal restriction provisions for disposal of certain ``contaminatedsoil'' and ``debris'' from CERCLA 104 and 106 response actions and fromRCRA corrective actions would not apply until 48 months from the enactmentof HSWA. These provisions apply specifically to soil and debris contaminatedwith spent solvents, certain dioxin-containing wastes, and California listrestricted hazardous wastes. November 8, 1988, therefore, is the applicableeffective date established under RCRA 3004 subsections (d)(3) and (e)(3)for CERCLA and RCRA corrective action contaminated soil and debris. Congressprovided no such alternative statutory effective date for CERCLA and RCRAsoil and debris contaminated with First Third (or Second Third) wastes.Thus, the statutory effective date for these wastes is the same as forany other hazardous waste which is included in the first one-third of theschedule_August 8, 1988. EPA has considered carefully the argument that the statutory effectivedate for solvent, dioxin, and HOC contaminated soils and debris from CERCLAresponse action and RCRA corrective actions cannot be extended becausethe national effective date for the underlying hazardous waste alreadyhas been extended for the maximum two years. EPA does not find this argumentpersuasive. First, sections 3004 (d)(3) and (e)(3) appear to establisha November 8, 1988 effective date for a particular category of wastes,namely contaminated soil and debris from CERCLA response actions and RCRAcorrective actions. Section 3004(h)(2) then gives the Agency the authorityto extend effective dates that otherwise would apply under subsection (d)or (e) for up to two years. The scheme, in fact, is similar to that forsolvent, dioxin and California list wastes land disposed by undergroundinjection, which are prohibited from land disposal on August 8, 1988 (RCRAsection 3004(f)), which effective date likewise may be extended due toa lack of protective alternative capacity for up to two years. Second, it is logical that Congress would have intended a later effectivedate for these wastes. An extra measure of environmental protection andaccountability is afforded for these wastes due to the CERCLA and RCRAcorrective action processes. These processes provide a documented connectionwith a regulatory process. Such a connection is not present for normaldisposal of restricted wastes, and thus makes less pressing the need foran immediate prohibition effective date. Most important, however, is Congress'evident acknowledgment that it would take extra time to develop treatmentcapacity for soils and debris at the cleanup sites contaminated with thesewastes. Foreseeing this potential shortfall, Congress placed these wasteson an alternative schedule approximately the same as the one for the firstgroup of wastes prohibited under section 3004(g). Restricted hazardouswastes are normally prohibited from land disposal as soon as the statutorydeadline passes. (RCRA section 3004(h)(1)). If, however, there is a lackof adequate alternative protective treatment, recovery, or disposal capacityto treat the wastes, the Agency may set an alternative effective date basedon the earliest date on which such adequate capacity becomes available,not to exceed two years. (RCRA section 3004(h)(2)). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Summary of the Proposed Agency Action </ITAG>In today's action, the Agency is proposing to grant a national capacityvariance for certain contaminated soils that require solids incinerationcapacity. This variance applies to the following specific categories ofsoils contaminated with the following wastes: (a) Soils contaminated withspent solvent (F001-F005) and dioxin-containing (F020-23 and F026-28) wastes(restricted under section 3004(e)) from a response action taken under CERCLAsection 104 or 106 or a RCRA corrective action; (b) soils contaminatedwith California list HOC wastes (under 3004(d)) from a response actiontaken under CERCLA section  104 or 106 or RCRA corrective actions; and(c) soils contaminated with certain First Third wastes for which the proposedtreatment standards are based on incineration. (This final capacity variancedoes not apply exclusively to soils from CERCLA response and RCRA correctiveactions. This is because there is no statutory distinction as to effectivedate between CERCLA/RCRA 3004(g) soils and all other soils as there isfor 3004 (d) and (e) soils.) The applicable First Third wastes includeK015, K016, K018, K019, K020, K024, K030, K037, and K048-K052 wastes addressedin the April 8, 1988 proposed rule (53 FR 11742), and K001, K083, K087,K101 and K102 wastes addressed in this proposal. Today's action proposesa 2-year national capacity variance from the applicable statutory effectivedate for these wastes. As such, the soils contaminated with the specifiedFirst Third wastes would receive a variance that extends the effectivedate for the land disposal restrictions to August 8, 1990. On the otherhand, CERCLA and RCRA soils contaminated with spent solvent, certain listeddioxin-containing wastes and California list HOC wastes would be coveredby the capacity variance until November 8, 1990_two years from the endof the statutory effective date applicable to these wastes.

For all other soils contaminatedwith these wastes, an application for a case-by-case extension may be submittedif adequate alternative capacity cannot reasonably be made available bythe applicable effective date. (See section 3004(h)(3).) Similarly, theproposed variance does not apply to California list HOC contaminated soilsexcept those resulting from a CERCLA 104 or 106 response action or RCRAcorrective action. Note that even though today's action proposes to rescindparts of the July 8, 1987 variances granted for HOCs, the existing capacityvariance remains in place until July 8, 1989 for California list HOC contaminatedsoils. Furthermore, the proposed variance does not apply to soils contaminatedwith First Third waste for which treatment standards have not been established(i.e., those wastes subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions). As a generalmatter, EPA is not proposing capacity variances for <T3>any </T3>soft hammer wastes. This is because the soft hammer itselfprovides a mechanism for ascertaining availability of treatment capacity(for wastes whose intended disposition is a landfill or impoundment), byplacing the burden of investigating and certifying on the person managingthe prohibited waste. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. The Facts Justifying a National Capacity Variance for These Soils</ITAG>Soils require rotary kiln incineration to meet BDAT standards. As mentionedin the section on capacity determinations (specifically III.D.4.), theevaluation of commercial rotary kiln incineration capacity required forsolids incineration, shows that there is only about 2 million gallons ofavailable commercial capacity (i.e., available after the effective datesfor the non-soil solvents wastes, the non-soil California list HOC wastesand non-soil First Third wastes).The amount of soil estimated to require solids incineration is shown below(These amounts represent the quantity of soils handled by commercial treatmentfacilities in 1986. Note, that the amount of soils requiring solids incinerationthat are generated hy CERCLA response or RCRA corrective actions is notcurrently known.):andbullet; Solvent_12 million gal/yr. andbullet; Dioxin_(none reported in 1986) andbullet; California List HOC's (other than First Third wastes for whichtreatment standards have been proposed)_4 million gal/yr. andbullet; First Third (for which treatment standards have been proposed)_10million gal/yr.Thus, all of the solids incineration capacity would be utilized as a resultof other actions taken today, and there will be a lack of capacity forsoils incineration. EPA acknowledges that in proposing a national capacity variance for contaminatedsoils, it is making a policy choice. That is, instead of proposing to rescindthe variance for other HOC and solvent wastes requiring solids incineration,and not proposing a variance for certain First Third wastes requiring thistype of treatment, EPA instead could try and carve out some segment ofCERCLA and RCRA corrective action soils for immediate prohibition (leavingin place, or proposing a variance for these other waste). EPA is not pursuingthis course for several reasons. First, it would be hard, if not impossible,to carve out a discrete segment of contaminated clean up soils to fit theavailable treatment capacity. More importantly, the precise amount of CERCLAand RCRA corrective action soils to be generated over the next 24 monthsis not certain (due to the unpredictable pace of clean up actions), whereasthe amount of the other surface disposal wastes discussed above that requiresolids incineration capacity is much better quantified. By rescinding,or not proposing, variances for the wastes whose volume is better quantified,EPA is far more certain that the existing treatment capacity will actuallybe utilized. That is, EPA will not be reserving scarce solids incinerationcapacity for contaminated soils that might never be generated. EPA thusis structuring these proposed variances to make certain that scarce solidsincineration capacity will actually be utilized. This is not to say that EPA will invariably allocate treatment capacityto prohibited wastes whose generation rate is qualified. For example, ifthe Agency were required to allocate between corrective action/responsewastes and wastes presently disposed of in underground injection wellsor surface units other than impoundments and landfills, the Agency mightchoose to allocate the capacity to the corrective action/response wastes,given that they are customarily generated at sites actually posing a risk.EPA plans to discuss this point further in regulations dealing with FirstThird wastes that are injected into underground wells. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Request for Comment on Variance for Contaminated Debris </ITAG>EPA is not proposing to grant a capacity variance for contaminated debris.Debris encompasses so many different types of materials_many of them highlyout of-the-ordinary_that generic determinations as to type of treatmentneeded, and amount generated, are difficult. EPA, however, solicits comment on whether a variance for contaminated debrisshould be granted. Such a variance would apply to all debris from CERCLAresponse actions and RCRA corrective actions which is contaminated withsolvents, certain dioxins or HOCs above 1,000 ppm. It would also applyto debris contaminated with first third wastes whose treatment standardis based on incineration. Although it is difficult to pinpoint exactlyhow much debris will be generated, much of it will be solids (see 51 FR40577, November 7, 1986) defining ``debris'' to include ``wood, stumps,clothing, equipment, building materials, storage containers, and liners'').The treatment standard for these solids will be based on incineration,and as noted above, EPA has allotted available solids incineration capacityfor wastes other than soils and debris. Put another way, if there is notenough solids incineration capacity to accommodate contaminated soils,there also is not enough solids incineration capacity to accommodate bothcontaminated soils plus contaminated debris. In addition, Congress linkedcontaminated soils and debris when it established a different effectivedate for these wastes in sections 3004 (d)(3) and (e)(3). EPA thus solicitscomment on extending the scope of the variance to include contaminateddebris. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. No Proposed Variance for Other Contaminated Soils </ITAG>EPA is not proposing a national capacity variance for any of the followinghazardous wastes: (a) Soils contaminated with solvents or dioxins whichdo not result from CERCLA response actions or RCRA corrective actions;and (b) soils contaminated with wastes whose treatment standard is notbased on incineration. (See chart: Summary of Current and Proposed EffectiveDates). With respect to soils that are not generated in the course of CERCLAor RCRA clean up activities, the applicable statutory effective date ofNovember 8, 1986 has already passed and cannot be extended further (anyperson who manages such wastes may, however, submit an application fora case-by-case extension to the effective date). With respect to contaminatedsoils not requiring incineration to achieve the treatment standard, thereis ample treatment capacity (for example, stabilization) so that a capacityvariance is not warranted. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Definition of ``Soil'' </ITAG>For the purpose of determining whether a contaminated material is subjectto this national variance, some definition of the term ``soil'' is needed.Soil is defined as materials that are primarily geologic in origin suchas silt, loam, or clay, and that are indigenous to the natural geologicalenvironment. In certain cases soils will be mixed with liquids, sludgesor debris. The Agency is soliciting comment with respect to appropriatemethods for determining whether such mixtures should be considered a soilwaste. Soils ordinarily do not include any wastes withdrawn from hazardouswaste management units, however, such as impoundment dredgings. EPA hascalculated that treatment capacity exists for these wastes, and in addition,they are sludges, not soils. In addition, contaminated soils would ordinarilyhave to result from some type of cleanup activity not associated with ahazardous waste management unit currently subject to regulations underParts 264 and 265. The Agency also notes that the proposed variance obviously would not applyto materials produced as a result of the deliberate addition of soil ordirt to a restricted hazardous waste. Such a practice is forbidden by theprovisions of the dilution prohibition (40 CFR 268.3). <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Notes on Drafting of the Regulatory Language </ITAG>To implement these changes in the various capacity variances, EPA is proposingto amend regulatory language in andSection;andSection; 268.30-268.33. Withrespect to the solvent wastes covered in andSection; 268.30, the Agency isproposing to add a new andSection; 268.30(a)(4) dealing with contaminatedsoil and debris from CERCLA response and RCRA corrective actions. Thisprovision would replace existing andSection; 268.1(c)(3). New andSection; 268.30(a)(5)-(7)would then indicate that certain residues from treating solvent wastesalso would have prohibition effective dates other then November 7, 1986.(Incidentally, we note that the final changes in new andSection; 268.30(a)(5)refers by cross-reference to treatment residues that have less than 1 percentsolvent (treatment residues in the (a)(3) treatability group) but not tocontaminated soils; this is because the contaminated soils in proposedandSection; 268.30(a)(4) would never be generated as residues from treatinganother restricted solvent waste). New andSection; 268.30(b) would then group all the solvent wastes havinga November 8, 1988 prohibition effective date (the andless;1% wastes in andSection;268.30(a)(3), the treatment residues in proposed andSection; 268.30(a)(5),and CERCLA response and RCRA corrective action debris, and residues fromtreating the debris). New andSection; 268.30(c) would group the wastes havingan earlier effective date: i.e., Small Quantity Generator, CERCLA responseand RCRA corrective action non-soil and debris wastes and residues fromtheir treatment. New andSection; 268.30(d) would set forth the 1990 effectivedate for CERCLA response and RCRA corrective action wastes. We also haveadded language indicating that if these wastes are to be disposed in landfillsor impoundments until the prohibition effective date then the landfillor impoundment unit must meet the section 3004(o) minimum technology requirements.(See 53 FR 11769 (April 8, 1988)). The Agency is proposing to make similar changes in andSection;andSection; 268.31,268.32, and 268.33 (this last provision still is proposed form) to reflectthe proposed, revised effective dates. The language in andSection; 268.33(c)would indicate that the 1990 effective date would apply to all soils contaminatedwith First Third wastes where the treatment standard for the waste is basedon incineration. Appendix II of Part 268 will list the technology basisfor treatment standards, and so provide a ready means of ascertaining whichstandards are based on incineration.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Modifications to the Land Disposal Restrictions Framework andto Proposed Soft Hammer Provisions </ITAG>A. Applicability (40 CFR 268.1) The Agency is proposing to add a new andSection; 268.1(d) to clarify thatthe Part 268 standards do not apply invariably to prohibited wastes generatedfrom CERCLA response actions. Rather, such wastes could be subject to oneor more of the waivers from otherwise applicable standards, which waiversare contained in CERCLA section 121(d)(4) (A)-(F). The same is true, ofcourse, of all other RCRA provisions, but EPA believes it particularlyimportant to mention this with respect to Part 268 because there are regulatoryprovisions that deal explicitly with prohibited wastes from CERCLA responseactions (see e.g. proposed andSection;andSection; 268.30(a)(4) and 268.30(c)).B. Recordkeeping (40 CFR 268.7) The November 7, 1986, rule (51 FR 40572) established a tracking systemfor wastes subject to the land disposal restrictions requiring treatmentfacilities to have records of the notices received from generators or othertreatment facilities, and disposal facilities to have copies of the notificationsand certifications provided by generators or treatment, storage and disposalfacilities as codified in 40 CFR 268.7. The April 8, 1988, notice (53 FR11742) proposed to modify the tracking system by having storage facilitiesmaintain files of the notices and certifications sent by generators andtreatment facilities. This proposal also developed a similar tracking systemfor wastes subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions which would requiregenerators and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities to keep recordsof the notices and 40 CFR 268.8 demonstrations and certifications. Today's notice proposes to further modify the tracking system to includein 40 CFR 268.7 (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) provisions statingthat generators and storers must retain copies of the notifications andcertifications forwarded to treatment, storage, and disposal facilitiesand received from storage facilities. The Agency believes that these changeswill enhance the enforceability of the land disposal restrictions regulationsand will make generator and storage recordkeeping requirements consistentwith the recordkeeping requirements of treatment and disposal facilities.Today EPA is also proposing an additional amendment to 40 CFR 268.7(a)(3)specifying that generators of wastes which are the subject of case-by-caseextensions or national variances, or disposers of wastes with ``no migration''exemptions must notify treatment and storage facilities receiving the wastes,a change that supplements, and is consistent with, the existing requirementto notify disposal facilities. In addition, the Agency is proposing thatgenerators must retain records of this notification. EPA is also proposing to add 40 CFR 268.7(a)(5) to require generators toretain records of data from testing the waste, treatment residual, or extractof the waste or treatment residual developed using the TCLP. The Agencybelieves that this addition to the regulations will establish consistencywith the existing provisions requiring that data supporting decisions torestrict wastes based on knowledge of the wastes must be maintained inthe generator's files. Furthermore, this action appears to enhance theenforceability of the regulations. EPA is requesting comment on the proposedrecordkeeping changes explained in this section of the preamble. EPA is also proposing to modify andSection; 268.7(a) to provide for a limitationon the time period that records are required to be retained by generators.Although the current regulations require owners and operators of facilitiesto maintain andSection; 268.7 records for a finite period of time, <T3>i.e., </T3>until closure of the facility (see andSection;andSection; 264.73(b)and 265.73(b)), the regulations currently provide that generators mustmaintain, for an <T3>indefinite </T3>period of time, all supporting data used to determinethat a waste is restricted based solely on the generator's knowledge. <T3>See </T3>existing andSection; 268.7(a)(4) (proposed to be redesignatedas andSection; 268.7(a)(5) in today's notice). In light of the indefinitetime period stated in this existing requirement and today's proposal torequire generators to maintain additional information (<T3>i.e., </T3>copies of the andSection; 268.7 notices, certifications, andall waste analysis data), the Agency believes that a finite time periodmay be a more appropriate burden on generators, while preserving the Agency'senforcement ability. Therefore, EPA is today proposing a 5-year limitationon the retention requirement for all records generators produce to complywith andSection; 268.7 of the land disposal restrictions. Similar to the generator manifest retention requirements in andSection; 262.40,EPA is proposing that the 5-year time period would begin on the date thatthe restricted waste is sent to on-site or off-site treatment, storage,or disposal. Also similar to the andSection; 262.40 manifest provision, the5-year retention requirement would be extended automatically during thecourse of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activityor as requested by the Administrator. Unlike the generator manifest requirements in andSection; 262.42, which providethat generators must submit an Exception Report to EPA if they have notreceived a signed copy of the manifest from the designated owner or operatorwithin 45 days from when the waste is accepted by the initial transporter,EPA is not proposing to create an exception reporting requirement for andSection;268.7generator records. The Agency believes that an additional exception reportingrequirement would be an undue burden on generators. Instead, EPA believesthat requiring generators to retain for a 5-year period the andSection;268.7records they produce is a more reasonable requirement, and that this wouldbe adequate to support the Agency's enforcement program. The Agency recognizesthat the proposed 5-year limit is unlike andSection; 262.40, which requiresgenerators to maintain a copy of the manifest for a 3-year period (subjectto the automatic extension mentioned above). EPA believes that a 5-yearlimit is an appropriate compromise to imposing an additional exceptionreporting requirement, particularly in light of the additional concernsCongress has expressed regarding the proper management of wastes that areprohibited from land disposal. However, the Agency also solicits commenton the need for a 5-year limit versus the usual 3-year limit. EPA also recognizes that the proposed 5-year retention requirement may,as a practical matter, result in a <T3>de facto</T3> change in the manifest retention requirement from threeyears to five years because many generators are putting the andSection; 268.7notices and certifications directly onto their manifests. The Agency doesnot intend to discourage the practice of putting this andSection; 268.7 documentationon the manifest to the extent that such practices comply with State requirements.However, EPA is requesting comment on the generator record retention requirementproposed in today's notice, including comment on whether a finite periodshould be specified and, if so, whether five years or some other time periodis appropriate. C. National Variance for Spent Solvent Waste Residues (40 CFR 268.30) EPA is also proposing to make a minor correction to 40 CFR 268.30(b) whichwill cross-reference rule language in the July 8, 1987, regulations (52FR 25760). Under this rule the Agency added 40 CFR 268.30(a)(4) statingthat residues from treating the wastes described in section 40 CFR 268.30(a)(1), (2), and (3) are eligible for a two-year variance from the effectivedate of the restrictions. EPA omitted, inadvertently, to cross-referenceparagraph (a)(4) in 40 CFR 268.30(b). We are proposing to correct the omissionin this rule. EPA is not soliciting further comment on 40 CFR 268.30(a)(4)or any other provision in 40 CFR 268.30(a) which does not address the rescissionof the variance for solvent-containing wastes (with the exception of andSection;268.30(a)(3) on which EPA has solicited comment; see 53 FR 11770). EPA is proposing the following minor changes to the provisions implementingthe section 3004(g)(6) soft hammer, which EPA proposed on April 8, 1988.D. Section 268.8(a)(3) EPA is proposing a small change in the language of proposed andSection; 268.8(a)(3),proposed at 53 FR 11788. The language should refer to landfills and surfaceimpoundments rather than all land disposal facilities, since the soft hammer,which proposed andSection; 268.8(a)(3) implements, restricts disposal onlyto landfills and surface impoundments. E. Section 268.8(b)(2) We are proposing language identical to that proposed on April 8, exceptthat we would delete the final clause which would allow the Regional Administratorto require a given method of treatment upon invalidating a certification.The soft hammer does not appear to allow EPA to affirmatively specify atype of treatment. F. Section 268.8(c) We are also proposing a change in proposed andSection; 268.8(c) to indicatemore clearly that prohibited soft hammer wastes can be disposed of in impoundmentsor landfills until the occurrence of the first of three events: (1) Thecertification is invalidated; (2) EPA establishes a treatment standard;or (3) the hard hammer falls.G. Section 268.33(g) We are proposing modified language to clarify a generator's testing obligationswhen a treatment standard specifies concentration levels in the total wasteversus the waste extract, and also proposing to delete the final threewords (``in this section'') since this reference was overly restrictive(omitting reference to no migration variances or treatability variances,to maintain only two of the omissions). <ITAG tagnum="84">V. State Authority </ITAG>A. Applicability of Rules in Authorized States Under section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administerand enforce the RCRA program within the State. Following authorization,EPA retains enforcement authority under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 ofRCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility.The standards and requirements for authorization are found in 40 CFR Part271. Prior to HSWA, a State with final authorization administered its hazardouswaste program in lieu of EPA administering the federal program in thatState. The Federal requirements no longer applied in the authorized State,and EPA could not issue permits for any facilities that the State was authorizedto permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgatedor enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority withinspecified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect inan authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.In contrast, under RCRA section 3006(g) (42 U.S.C. 6926(g)), new requirementsand prohibitions imposed by HSWA take effect in authorized States at thesame time that they take effect in nonauthorized States. EPA is directedto carry out these requirements and prohibitions in authorized States,including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorizationto do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as Statelaw to retain final authorization, HSWA applies in authorized States inthe interim. Today's rule is proposed pursuant to sections 3004 (d) through (k), and(m), of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6924 (d) through (k), and (m)). Therefore, it willbe added to Table l in 40 CFR 271.1(j), which identifies the Federal programrequirements that are promulgated pursuant to HSWA and take effect in allStates, regardless of their authorization status. States may apply foreither interim or final authorization for the HSWA provisions in Table1, as discussed in the following section. When this rule is promulgated,Table 2 in 40 CFR 271.1(j) will be modified also to indicate that thisrule is a self-implementing provision of HSWA. B. Effect on State Authorizations As noted above, EPA will implement today's proposal in authorized Statesuntil their programs are modified to adopt these rules and the modificationis approved by EPA. Because the rule is promulgated pursuant to HSWA, aState submitting a program modification may apply to receive either interimor final authorization under RCRA section 3006(g)(2) or 3006(b), respectively,on the basis of requirements that are substantially equivalent or equivalentto EPA's. The procedures and schedule for State program modifications foreither interim or final authorization are described in 40 CFR 271.21. Itshould be noted that HSWA interim authorization will expire on January1, 1993 (see 40 CFR 271.24(c)). Section 271.21(e)(2) requires that States that have final authorizationmust modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and mustsubsequently submit the modification to EPA for approval. State programmodifications must be made by July 1, 1991, if only regulatory changesare necessary or July 1, 1992, if statutory changes are necessary. Thesedeadlines can be extended in exceptional cases (see andSection; 271.21(e)(3)).States with authorized RCRA programs may have requirements similar to thosein today's proposal. These State regulations have not been assessed againstthe Federal regulations being proposed today to determine whether theymeet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State is not authorized to implementthese requirements in lieu of EPA until the State program modificationis approved. Of course, States with existing standards may continue toadminister and enforce their standards as a matter of State law. In implementingthe Federal program, EPA will work with States under agreements to minimizeduplication of efforts. In many cases, EPA will be able to defer to theStates in their efforts to implement their programs rather than take separateactions under Federal authority. States that submit official applications for final authorization less than12 months after the effective date of these regulations may be approvedwithout including equivalent standards. However, once authorized, a Statemust modify its program to include standards substantially equivalent orequivalent to EPA's within the time periods discussed above. The amendments being proposed today need not affect the State's UndergroundInjection Control (UIC) primacy status. A State currently authorized toadminister the UIC program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) couldcontinue to do so without seeking authority to administer these amendments.However, a State which wished to implement Part 148 and receive authorizationto grant exemptions from the land disposal restrictions would have to demonstratethat it had the requisite authority to administer section 3004 (f) and(g) of RCRA. The conditions under which such an authorization may takeplace are summarized below and are discussed in 50 FR 28728, <T3>et seq., </T3>July 15, 1985. C. State Implementation The following four aspects of the framework established in the November7, 1986, rule (51 FR 40572) affect State implementation of today's proposaland impact State actions on the regulated community: 1. Under Part 268, Subpart C, EPA is proposing land disposal restrictionsfor all generators, treaters, storers, and disposers of certain types ofhazardous waste. In order to retain authorization, States must adopt theregulations under this Subpart since State requirements can be no lessstringent than Federal requirements. 2. Also under Part 268, EPA is proposing to grant and rescind two-yearnational variances from the effective dates of the land disposal restrictionsbased on an analysis of available alternative treatment, recovery, or disposalcapacity. Under andSection; 268.5, case-by-case extensions of up to one year(renewable for one additional year) may be granted for specific applicantslacking adequate capacity. The Administrator of EPA is solely responsible for granting variances tothe effective dates because these determinations must be made on a nationalbasis. In addition, it is clear that RCRA section 3004(h)(3) intends forthe Administrator to grant case-by-case extensions after consulting theaffected States, on the basis of national concerns which only the Administratorcan evaluate. Therefore, States cannot be authorized for this aspect ofthe program. 3. Under andSection; 268.44, the Agency may grant waste-specific variancesfrom treatment standards in cases where it can be demonstrated that thephysical and/or chemical properties of the wastes differ significantlyfrom wastes analyzed in developing the treatment standards, and the wastescannot be treated to specified levels or treated by specified methods.The Agency is solely responsible for granting such variances since theresult of such an action will be the establishment of new waste treatabilitygroups. All wastes meeting the criteria of these new waste treatabilitygroups will also be subject to the variances, and thus, granting such varianceshas national impacts. Therefore, this aspect of the program is not delegatedto the States. 4. Under andSection; 268.6, EPA may grant petitions of specific durationto allow land disposal of certain hazardous wastes where it can be demonstratedthat there will be no migration of hazardous constituents for as long asthe waste remains hazardous. States which have the authority to impose restrictions may be authorizedunder RCRA section 3006 to grant petitions for exemptions from the restrictions.Decisions on site-specific petitions do not require the national perspectiverequired to restrict wastes or grant extensions. However, the Agency isplanning to propose an interpretation of the ``no migration'' languagein the <T4>Federal Register </T4>for public comment. Because of the controversysurrounding the interpretation of the statutory language, and the potentialfor changes in policy, EPA will be handling ``no migration'' petitionsat Headquarters, though the States may be authorized to grant these petitionsin the future. The Agency expects to gain valuable experience and informationfrom review of ``no migration'' petitions which may affect future landdisposal restrictions rulemakings. In accordance with RCRA section 3004(i),EPA will publish notice of the Agency's final decision on petitions inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>. States are free to impose their own disposal restrictions if such actionsare more stringent or broader in scope than the actions of Federal programs(RCRA section 3009 and 40 CFR 271.1(i)). Where States impose such restrictions,the broader and more stringent State restrictions govern.<ITAG tagnum="85">VI. Effect of the Land Disposal Restrictions Program on Other EnvironmentalPrograms </ITAG>A. Discharges Regulated Under the Clean Water Act As a result of the land disposal restrictions program, some generatorsmight switch from land disposal of restricted First Third wastes to dischargeto publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs) in order to avoid incurring thecosts of alternative treatment. In shifting from land disposal to dischargeto POTWs, an increase in human and environmental risks could occur. Alsoas a result of the land disposal restrictions, hazardous waste generatorsmight illegally discharge their wastes to surface waters without treatment,which could cause damage to the local ecosystem and potentially pose healthrisks from direct exposure or bioaccumulation. Some generators might treat their wastes prior to discharging to a POTW,but the treatment step itself could increase risks to the environment.For example, if incineration were the pretreatment step, metals and otherhazardous constituents present in air scrubber waters could be dischargedto surface waters. However, the amount of First Third waste shifted toPOTWs would be limited by such factors as the physical form of the waste,the degree of pretreatment required prior to discharge, and State and localregulations. B. Discharges Regulated Under the Marine Protection, Research, and SanctuariesAct (MPRSA) Management of some First Third wastes could be shifted from land disposalto ocean dumping and ocean-based incineration. If the cost of ocean-baseddisposal plus transportation were lower than the cost of land-based treatment,disposal, and transportation, this option could become an attractive alternative.In addition, ocean-based disposal could become attractive to the regulatedcommunity if land-based treatment were not available. Although there may be economic incentives to manage restricted First Thirdwastes by ocean dumping and ocean-based incineration, both technologiesrequire permits, which could be issued only if technical requirements (e.g.,physical form and heating value) and MPRSA environmental criteria (e.g.,constituent concentrations, toxicity, solubility, density, and persistence)were met. MPRSA requires that nine specific factors, including the availabilityand impacts of land-based disposal alternatives, be considered before permitscan be issued for ocean disposal. C. Air Emissions Regulated Under the Clean Air Act Some treatment technologies applicable to First Third wastes could resultin cross-media transfer of hazardous constituents to air. For example,incineration of metal-bearing wastes could result in metal emissions toair. Some constituents, such as chromium, can be more toxic if inhaledthan if ingested. Therefore, it might be necessary to issue regulatorycontrols for some technologies to ensure they are operated properly. The Agency has taken several steps to address this issue. EPA has initiateda program to address metal emissions from incinerators. It has also initiatedtwo programs under section 3004(n) to address air emissions from othersources. The first program will address fugitive emissions from equipmentsuch as pumps, valves, and vents from units processing concentrated organicwaste streams. The second program will address other sources of air emissions,such as tanks and waste transfer and handling. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Regulatory Requirements </ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact Analysis <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Purpose </ITAG>The Agency estimated the costs, benefits, and economic impacts of today'sproposed rule. These estimates are required for ``major'' regulations asdefined by Executive Order 12291. The Agency is also required under theRegulatory Flexibility Act to assess small business impacts resulting fromthe proposed rule. The cost and economic impact estimates serve, additionally,as measures of the practical capability of facilities to comply with theproposed rule. The results indicate that today's supplementary proposed rule is not amajor rule. (However, in combination with the previous proposal (April8, 1988; 53 FR 11742), the rule is a major rule.) This section of the preamblediscusses the results of the analyses of the proposed rule as detailedin the draft Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the proposed rule. Thedraft RIA is available in the public docket. The analyses presented in this section and in the draft RIA do not fullyreflect the current status of the proposed rule. Certain wastes were includedin the RIA, but due to the additional time required to set treatment standardsfor the wastes, were not part of the proposed rule. In addition, treatmentstandards were set in the proposed rule for certain wastes which did notappear in the database used for the RIA and which were therefore not analyzed.These discrepancies will be addressed in the RIA for the First Third finalrule. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Executive Order No. 12291 </ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires EPA to assess the effect of proposed Agencyactions and alternatives during the development of regulations. Such anassessment consists of a quantification of the potential benefits and costsof the rule, as well as a description of any beneficial or adverse effectsthat cannot be quantified in monetary terms. In addition, Executive OrderNo. 12291 requires that regulatory agencies prepare a Regulatory ImpactAnalysis (RIA) for major rules. Major rules are defined as those likelyto result in: andbullet; An annual cost to the economy of $100 million or more; or andbullet; A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individualindustries; or andbullet; Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,innovation, or international trade. The Agency has prepared an RIA and has concluded that the supplementaryproposed rule is not a major rule. The annual cost to the economy of thesupplementary proposed rule would be approximately $36 million. (However,in combination with the previous proposal (April 8, 1988, 53 FR 11742),the rule would be a major rule with an annual cost of $717-732 million.)<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Basic Approach </ITAG>EPA is proposing to set treatment standards for a subset of the First ThirdF and K wastes. The effects of the proposed rule were estimated by comparisonof post-regulatory costs, benefits, and economic impacts with those resultingunder baseline conditions. The baseline is defined to be continued landdisposal of wastes in units meeting minimum technological requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Methodology </ITAG>a. <T3>Determination of Affected Population and Waste Management Practices.</T3>The first step in determining the populations of affected wastes andfacilities was to characterize waste streams based on available characterizationreports and professional judgement. (See Section C for references.) Thischaracterization data was matched with information on waste quantitiesand management practices from the 1981 RIA Mail Survey and the 1984 SmallQuantity Generator Survey to determine the waste streams and facilitiespotentially affected by the proposed rule. Waste quantities and numbersof facilities from each survey were scaled up, by means of weighting factors,to represent the national population of wastes and facilities. Next, it was necessary to adjust the affected waste and facility populationsby considering the cost of compliance with regulations which have takeneffect since the 1981 RIA Mail Survey was conducted. In particular, EPAadjusted reported waste management practices to reflect compliance withthe provisions of 40 CFR Part 264, which apply to permitted treatment,storage, and disposal facilities. In making this adjustment, the Agencyassumed that facilities would elect the least costly methods of compliance.This adjustment defines not only baseline management practices and costsassociated with them, but also the number of facilities and wastes streamsin the affected population. For example, for some facilities, the costsof land disposing certain wastes may have been driven so high by the minimumtechnological requirements that other management modes became less expensive.EPA assumes that these facilities no longer land dispose these wastes andthat these wastes are no longer part of the population of wastes that maybe affected by any restrictions on land disposal. Finally, it was necessary to consider the overlap between First Third wastesand California list, solvent, and dioxin wastes. A number of First Thirdwastes are California list wastes, and a few First Third mixed wastes containsolvents and dioxins. To isolate the impacts of this proposed rule, itwas necessary to ``net out'' the costs, economic impacts, and benefitsstemming from treatment standards established under other rules; in somecases this resulted in waste streams and facilities being dropped fromthe affected population for this rule. The population of wastes which would be affected by the proposed rule mayinclude some wastes from CERCLA responses or RCRA corrective actions. However,there are insufficient data at present to estimate these quantities. Undergroundinjected wastes were excluded from this analysis; these wastes will bedealt with in the RIA for a separate rule.The population of affected facilities may include: andbullet; Commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities(commercial TSDFs), which charge a fee for hazardous waste disposal; andbullet; Non-commercial TSDFs, which provide disposal services for wastesgenerated on-site or off-site by their parent firms; andbullet; Generators, which send their waste off-site to commercial TSDFsfor disposal; and andbullet; Small quantity generators (SQGs), which send their waste off-siteto commercial TSDFs. b. <T3>Cost Methodology. </T3>Once waste quantity, type and method of treatmentwere known for the population of affected facilities, EPA developed estimatesof costs of compliance for individual facilities, based on cost estimatesfor surveyed facilities representing the affected population. EPA estimatedbaseline and compliance waste management costs using engineering judgment.Wastes amendable to similar types of treatment were grouped to identifyeconomies of scale available through co-treatment and disposal. Facilities face several possible options if they may no longer land disposeof their wastes. EPA applied the same rationale in predicting facilitychoice among these options as it did in establishing the affected population:Facilities were assumed to elect the least costly method of complying withthe requirements of this rule. Costs of compliance were derived by predictingthe minimum-cost method of compliance with land disposal restrictions foreach facility and calculating the increment between that and baseline disposalcosts. As in the analysis of baseline costs, economies of scale in wastemanagement were considered. Shipping costs for wastes sent off-site formanagement were also considered. EPA developed facility-specific compliance costs in two components, whichwere weighted and then summed to estimate total national costs of the rule.The first component of the total compliance cost is incurred annually foroperation and maintenance (O andamp; M) of alternative modes of waste treatmentand disposal. The second component of the compliance cost is a capitalcost which is an initial facility outlay incurred for construction anddepreciable assets. Capital costs were restated as annual values by usinga capital recovery factor based on a nominal interest rate of nine percent.These annualized capital costs were then added to yearly O andamp; M coststo derive an annual compliance cost. c. <T3>Economic Impact Methodology_</T3>(1) <T3>Non-Commercial TSDFs and SQGs. </T3>EPA assessed economic impacts onnon-commercial TSDFs and SQGs in several steps. First, the Agency employeda general screening analysis to compare facility-specific incremental coststo financial information for firms, disaggregated by Standard IndustrialClassification (SIC) and number of employees per facility. (See SectionC for references.) This comparison was based on two ratios, which wereused to identify facilities likely to experience adverse economic effects.The first is a ratio of individual facility compliance costs to costs ofproduction. This ratio represents the percent product price increase forfacility output that occurs if the entire compliance cost_accompanied byfacility profit_is passed through to customers in the form of higher prices.A change exceeding five percent is considered to imply a substantial adverseeconomic effect on a facility. The second is a coverage ratio relatingcash from operations to costs of compliance. This ratio represents thenumber of times that facility gross margin covers the regulatory compliancecost if the facility fully absorbs the cost. For this ratio, a value ofless than 20 is considered to represent a significant adverse effect. Thecoverage ratio is the more stringent of the two ratios, but exceeding thecritical level in either one suggests that facility is likely to be significantlyaffected. These ratios bound possible effects on individual firms. Once facilities experiencing adverse economic effects were identified usingthe two screening ratios, a more detailed financial analysis was performedto verify the results and to focus more closely on affected facilities.For this subset of facilities, the coverage ratio was adjusted by allowinga portion of costs to be passed through. Economic effects on individualfacilities were examined assuming that product price increases of fivepercent were possible. Those facilities for which the coverage ratio wasless than two were considered likely to close. (2) <T3>Commercial TSDFs. </T3>For this group of facilities, there exists noCensus SIC from which to draw financial information. Two SICs which mightbe used as proxies, 4953 and 4959, do not distinguish between financialdata for hazardous waste treatment firms and for firms managing municipaland solid wastes. Consequently, the analysis of economic effects on commercialfacilities was qualitative. This analysis included an examination of thequantity of waste each facility received from the waste group restrictedby today's rule. EPA also examined the ability of each facility to providethe additional treatment required once these restrictions were promulgated,and thus to retain or expand that portion of its business generated byrestricted wastes. (3) <T3>Generators. </T3>EPA's analysis of the economic effects of this ruleon generators disposing of large quantities of affected wastes off-siteassumed that commercial facilities could entirely pass on to them the costsof compliance with this regulation in the form of higher prices for wastemanagement services. Because of data limitations in the RIA Mail Survey,EPA did not develop plant-specific waste characterizations, treatment methods,and compliance costs for generators, as it did for TSDFs. The analysisof the economic effects of today's proposed rule on this group used RIAMail Survey data to develop model plants generating average waste quantities.This allowed EPA to assess possible effects on generating plants. d. <T3>Benefits Methodology. </T3>The benefits of today's proposed rule wereevaluated by considering the reduction in human health risk that wouldresult from using alternative treatment for First Third wastes rather thanemploying baseline management practices. Due to time and budget constraints,the benefits from human health risk reduction were analyzed qualitatively.Estimates of risk reduction from previous RIAs were used for certain wastesin this RIA where there was correspondence between the wastes in termsof waste codes, physical forms, baseline and alternative management practices,and quantities. Human health risk is defined herein as the probability of injury, disease,or death over a given time (70 years) due to responses to doses of disease-causingagents. The human health risk posed by a waste management practice is afunction of the toxicity of the chemical constituents in the waste streamand the extent of human exposure to the constituents. The likelihood ofexposure is dictated by hydrogeologic and climatic settings at land disposalunits and the fate and transport of chemical constituents in environmentalmedia. EPA estimated human health risk in previous RIAs in four steps. The firststep was to estimate the concentrations of each of the hazardous constituentsof the waste stream in each of the three media (air, surface water, andground water) into which they might be released by a certain waste managementtechnology. These estimates depend on the steady-state (i.e., continuous)release rates calculated for each technology, and on environmental fateand transport characteristics for constituents. The next step was to estimate the total human intake, or dose, of eachof the chemicals through inhalation of air and ingestion of ground water,surface water, and contaminated fish. A 65 kilogram person was assumedto be continuously exposed to contaminated media over a 70-year lifetime.The Agency next calculated the risk to an individual from the dose derivedin the previous step. EPA estimated the relationship of dose to effect(using a ``dose-response'' curve developed based on toxicity data) andweighted the effect according to severity. Finally, EPA estimated the population risk by multiplying the average individualrisk by the number of people in a given environment. The whole processdescribed above was repeated 2,000 times, using different population sizesand environmental settings drawn from representative distributions, togenerate a population risk distribution for each waste-technology combination.The mean of the distribution for the baseline disposal technology was comparedwith the mean of the distribution for an alternative treatment technologyto derive the net benefit of the land disposal restrictions for that wastestream. Risks were not discounted.Benefits other than reduction in human health risk_such as resource damageavoided and corrective action costs avoided_were not quantified. As a result,the benefits of the land disposal restrictions for First Third wastes arelikely to be understated. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Results </ITAG>a. <T3>Population of Affected Facilities. </T3>Most of the affected facilitieswere generators. Of 138 affected facilities, 95 were generators, 23 werenon-commercial TSDFs, and 20 were commercial TSDFs. No SQGs were affected.b. <T3>Costs. </T3>The annualized incremental cost of the supplemental proposedrule is approximately $36 million, making the rule a minor rule. (However,in combination with the previous proposal (April 8, 1988; 53 FR 11742),the rule would be a major rule with an annual cost of $717-732 million.)Most of the cost of the rule is associated with the treatment of K086 andK087 wastes. Most of the waste affected by the proposed rule was land disposed in thebaseline (as opposed to being stored or treated in surface impoundmentsor treated under California list land disposal restrictions); the post-regulatorypractice for most of the waste was incineration. All of the waste storedin surface impoundments in the baseline dropped out of the analysis becausestorage in tanks was found to be less expensive than retrofitting surfaceimpoundments to meet Part 264 requirements. Nearly all of the waste treatedin surface impoundments dropped out of the analysis, since treatment wasless costly than compliance with Part 264 requirements. The small quantityof dredged material from these impoundments requiring treatment causedthese costs to be low. c. <T3>Economic Impacts. </T3>Twenty-six facilities would be significantlyimpacted by the proposed rule. Of these, 21 are generators and 5 are non-commercialTSDFs. Commercial TSDFs were assumed to pass all compliance costs throughto generators; therefore, the number of significantly affected commercialfacilities was not calculated. The significantly impacted non-commercial TSDFs are from the Chemicalsand Allied Products industry and the Primary metals industry (SICs 28 and33, respectively). Significantly impacted generators are from the PrimaryMetals industry (SIC 33), Fabricated Metals industry (SIC 34), and TransportationEquipment industry (SIC 34). Commercial TSDFs fall primarily into the Electric,Gas, and Sanitary Services sector (SIC 49); those facilities specializingin land disposal services could be adversely affected. d. <T3>Benefits. </T3>Quantitative estimates of human health risk reduction,derived from previous RIAs, were available for four of the 19 waste streamsincluded in the cost analysis. These four waste streams represent approximately25 percent of the total waste volume included in the cost analysis. Thetotal benefits for these four waste streams are a reduction of 20 casesof adverse health effects over 70 years, or an annual reduction of 0.29cases. All of these benefits are due to one K087 waste stream. Benefits for another six waste streams were assessed qualitatively andfound to be low or zero. Data for assessing the benefits of the remainingnine waste streams were not available. B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>whenever an agency is required to publish a notice ofrulemaking for a proposed rule, it must prepare and make available forpublic comment a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) that describes theeffect of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations,and small governmental jurisdictions). This analysis is unnecessary, however,if the Agency's administrator certifies that the rule will not have a significanteconomic effect on a substantial number of small entities. EPA evaluated the economic effect of the proposed rule on small entities,here defined as concerns employing fewer than 50 persons. Because of datalimitations, this small business analysis excluded generators of largequantities of First Third wastes. The small business population thereforeincluded only two groups: All non-commercial TSDFs employing fewer than50 persons and all SQGs which were also small businesses. According to EPA's guidelines for conducting an RFA, if over 20 percentof the population of small businesses, small organizations, or small governmentjurisdictions is likely to experience financial distress based on the costsof the rule, then the agency is required to consider that the rule willhave a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities andto perform a formal RFA. EPA has examined the proposed rule's potentialeffects on small entities as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act.Only small businesses were identified as being affected by the proposedrule, and fewer than 20 percent of the small businesses were significantlyaffected based on the EPA guidelines. EPA has therefore concluded thattoday's proposed rule will not have a significant effect on a substantialnumber of small entities. As a result of this finding, EPA has not prepareda formal RFA in support of the rule. More detailed information on smallbusiness impacts is available in the RIA for this rule. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have beensubmitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) underthe Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information CollectionRequest document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 1447) and a copy maybe obtained from Rick Westlund, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M StreetSW. (PM-223), Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202) 382-2745. Submitcomments on these requirements to EPA and: Office of Information and RegulatoryAffairs, OMB, 726 Jackson Place NW., Washington, DC 20503 marked ``Attention:Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or publiccomments on the information collection requirements. D. Review of Supporting Documents The primary source of information on current land disposal practices andindustries affected by this rule was EPA's ``National Survey of HazardousWaste Generators and Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities Regulatedunder RCRA in 1981'' (the RIA Mail Survey) (April 1984). EPA's ``NationalSmall Quantity Hazardous Waste Generator Survey'' (February 1985) was themajor source of data on small quantity generators. Waste stream characterization data and engineering costs of waste managementwere based on the following EPA documents: andbullet; ``Characterization of Waste Streams Listed in 40 CFR Part 261Waste Profiles,'' Vols. I and II (August 1985); andbullet; ``Characterization of Constituents from Selected Waste StreamsListed in 40 CFR Part 261,'' Vols. I and II (August 1985); andbullet; RCRA background and listing documents for 40 CFR Part 261; andbullet; RCRA Section 3007 industry studies; andbullet; ``RCRA Risk-Cost Analysis Model, Appendix A: Waste Stream DataBase'' (March 1984); and andbullet; Source assessment documents for various industries. Financialinformation for the economic impact analysis was obtained from the 1982Census of Manufacturers and 1984 Annual Survey of Manufacturers. Producerprice indices were used to restate 1984 dollars in l987 terms. E. Rescission of National Variance for Certain Solvent and California ListWastes EPA is proposing to rescind parts of the variances granted under the November7, 1986 and July 8, 1987 rules. Specifically, variances would be rescindedfor small quantity generator (SQG) solvent wastes; non-wastewater HOCswith concentrations greater than 1,000 mg/l; and solid HOCs with concentrationsgreater than 1,000 mg/kg (except HOC soils). Rescission of these varianceswould have two impacts. First, affected waste generators would have tocomply with waste treatment standards at an earlier date. In the case ofSQG solvents, rescission of the variance would cause post-regulatory coststo be incurred in August 1988 rather than in November 1988. In the caseof California list HOCs, rescission of the variance would cause post-regulatorycosts to be incurred in August 1988 rather than in July 1989. The movementof the post-regulatory costs forward in time would result in only minorincreases in overall post-regulatory costs (approximately five percentof pre-rescission post-regulatory costs for the wastes affected). (Referto the background materials on the rescission of land disposal restrictionvariances for a discussion of the methodology and results of the rescissionanalysis.) The second impact of the rescission would be to prohibit wastes from landdisposal at an earlier date. This would result in short-term benefits tohuman health and the environment to the extent that alternative treatmentis less risky than land disposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Implementation of the Land Disposal Restrictions Program </ITAG>The generator or owner/operator of a treatment, storage, and disposal facilitymust follow the waste management procedures specified in 40 CFR Part 268which are applicable to the restricted hazardous wastes subject to theprovisions in today's proposal. These wastes are listed in Subpart C ofPart 268. The corresponding treatment standards and effective dates arefound in Part 268 Subpart D. After the applicable effective date, a generatorof a waste must determine, at the point of initial generation, if the wastemeets the treatment standard. This determination can be made based on knowledgeor analysis of the hazardous constituents in the waste, treatment residual,or extract of the waste or treatment residual. Data supporting a determinationbased on knowledge must be kept in the generator's files. A waste which meets the treatment standard or is the subject of a nationalvariance, case-by-case extension, or ``no migration'' exemption can beland disposed. The generator must satisfy the notification and certificationrequirements of 40 CFR 268.7(a) (2) and (3). The land disposal facilityis required by 40 CFR 268.7(c) to keep a record of the notice and certificationand verify that the treatment standard was met by testing according tothe frequency specified in the facility's waste analysis plan. A waste which does not meet the treatment standard can be land disposedafter adequate treatment. The generator must notify the treatment facilityin accordance with 40 CFR 268.7(a)(1). The treatment facility must maintaina record of the notification and test the treated wastes according to thefrequency specified in the facility's waste analysis plan. For treatedwastes which meet the standard the treatment facility must provide thenotice and certification required under 40 CFR 268.7(b) (1) and (2) tothe land disposal facility. For treated wastes which do not meet the standardthe treatment facility must comply with the notice requirements of 40 CFR268.7(a)(1) if the waste will be managed at a different treatment facility.In the April 8, 1988, rule (53 FR 11742) EPA solicited comment on modificationsto 40 CFR 268.7 which would enable the Agency to track, from generatorto treatment and/or disposal facility, the management of restricted hazardouswastes subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions. For today's proposalthese are wastes listed in 40 CFR 268.10 which do not have treatment standardsproposed in this notice or the April 8, 1988 notice. Comments pertainingto the proposed demonstration, certification, and notification requirementsfor these wastes should be addressed to the   April 8, 1988 notice. Although EPA has stated in earlier rules (<T3>see </T3>51 FR 40572, November 7, 1986; 52 FR 21010, June 4, 1987;52 FR 25760, July 8, 1987) that restricted wastes are subject to certainPart 268 requirements (e.g., the andSection; 268.7 recordkeeping requirementsand the andSection; 268.3 dilution prohibitions) even if such wastes aresubject to an exemption, extension, or variance making them eligible forland disposal, the Agency has become aware of some confusion in the regulatedcommunity regarding this point. The confusion seems to have been createdthrough the interchanging use, by both the regulated community and, insome instances, by EPA, of the terms ``restricted'' and ``prohibited.''To eliminate this confusion, EPA is clarifying the distinction between``restricted'' and ``prohibited'' wastes in today's notice. ``Restricted'' wastes are those categories of hazardous wastes that areprohibited from land disposal either by regulation or statute (regardlessof whether subcategories of such wastes are subject to a andSection; 268.5extension, andSection; 268.6 ``no migration'' exemption, or national capacityvariance, any of which makes them currently eligible for land disposal).In other words, a hazardous waste is ``restricted'' no later than the dateof the deadline established in, or pursuant to, RCRA section 3004. Therefore,the F001-F005 solvent wastes and the F020-F023 and F026-F028 dioxin-containingwastes were ``restricted'' as of November 8, 1986, despite the fact thatseveral subcategories of these wastes obtained 2-year national capacityvariances allowing them to be land disposed until November 8, 1988. Similarly,California List wastes were ``restricted'' as of July 8, 1987, despitethe fact that several subcategories of such wastes obtained 2-year nationalcapacity variances allowing continued land disposal until July 8, 1989.Wastes contained in the schedule of thirds (51 FR 19300, May 28, 1986)are considered ``restricted'' no later than the dates specified in theschedule promulgated at 40 CFR 268.10, 268.11, and 268.12. Generators must determine whether their wastes are ``restricted'' at thepoint of initial generation, <T3>i.e., </T3>when the waste is first considered a hazardous wastes subjectto RCRA regulation. To determine whether a hazardous waste is ``restricted,''generators need only determine whether the waste belongs to a categoryof wastes that has been prohibited from land disposal by regulation orby the automatic ``hammer'' provisions of RCRA. ``Prohibited'' wastes area subset of ``restricted'' wastes, <T3>i.e., </T3>they are those ``restricted'' wastes that are currentlyineligible for land disposal. Therefore, a hazardous waste that is not``restricted'' cannot be ``prohibited'' under RCRA section 3004. However,once a waste is considered ``restricted,'' at least some of the Part 268requirements apply. The first Part 268 requirement applicable to ``restricted'' wastes is thatgenerators must determine whether their waste currently is eligible forland disposal pursuant to the requirements of andSection; 268.7. If the wastescurrently is not eligible for land disposal (<T3>i.e., </T3>the prohibition effective date has passed, the waste doesnot meet all applicable treatment standards or prohibition levels, andno andSection; 268.5 extensions, andSection; 268.6 ``no migration'' exemptions,or national capacity variances apply), then the waste currently is ``prohibited''from land disposal as well as ``restricted.'' If, however, the waste currentlyis eligible for land disposal (<T3>i.e., </T3>the prohibition effective date has passed but the wastemeets the applicable treatment standards or prohibition levels or is subjectto a andSection; 268.5 extension, andSection; 268.6 ``no migration'' exemption,or national capacity variance) then the waste is considered ``restricted''but not currently ``prohibited.'' All wastes that are ``restricted'' mustcomply with the andSection; 268.3 dilution prohibition (assuming the wastesare land disposed or otherwise managed after the prohibition effectivedate), the andSection; 268.7 waste analysis and recordkeeping requirements,and all other applicable Part 268 requirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">IX.
