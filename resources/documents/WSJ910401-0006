The CBS executives met over a two-day period with themanagement-consulting firm McKinsey andamp; Co., which was hired inJanuary by CBS Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer. InJanuary, Mr. Stringer said McKinsey was retained to focus onmaking CBS more efficient rather than on trimming the6,650-employee company's payroll.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Stringer couldn't be reached for comment on thesessions with McKinsey or on the rumors of impending layoffs.A company spokeswoman declined to comment.   The meetings with McKinsey come as the CBS network bracesfor an expected operating loss for 1991, hurt by slowadvertising spending, costly war coverage, high sports costsand weak ratings. CBS is expected to finish the 1990-91season next month in third place for the fourth consecutiveyear, albeit by only two-tenths of a ratings point behind theABC network, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.   The overall company expects operating profit in thecurrent quarter to be significantly below the $89.1 millionposted in the year-earlier period, CBS said in its annualfiling with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlierthis month. CBS also has said it will post a full-yeardecline in earnings in 1991.   Some CBS officials said it was doubtful that McKinseyrecommended layoffs. Mr. Stringer had asked the firm &quot;totackle with some insight the spiraling costs and dwindlingrevenues that are leading some of us to say, `Stop the world,I want to get off.'&quot; Nonetheless, rumors about layoffs arerife at CBS corporate headquarters and at CBS News.   At CBS News, whose work force is down to 1,070 from 1,470before Mr. Tisch took control of CBS in 1986, staff membersare bracing for a possible reduction of at least 100employees. There was speculation that the personnel in somenews bureaus, including Dallas and Johannesburg, SouthAfrica, would be reduced. A CBS News spokesman declinedcomment.</TEXT></DOC>
