Four kinds of gas mixture wereused in the prototyp: 40% Ar/60% isobutane, 44.5% Ar/44.5% CH/sub 4//11%methylal 47% Ar/47% CH/sub 4//6% methylal, and 49.3% Ar/49.3% CH/sub4//1.4% ethyl alcohol. The results show that using SQS tube as a samplingmeans in the BES shower counter is feasible for Beijing Electron PositronCollider (BEPC) energy region of 2 x 2.2/2.8 GeV.</TEXT></DOC>
