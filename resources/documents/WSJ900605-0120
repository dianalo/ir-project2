A brace of Supreme Court decisions yesterday showedcommon sense prevailing over legal abstractions.   The court upheld the constitutionality of Bible readingclubs in public schools. It ruled that undercover policeagents do not need to warn suspects that they have a right toa lawyer. And it held that when police with a search warrantfind incriminating evidence in plain sight they can seize iteven if the warrant didn't specifically mention it.</LP><TEXT>   It is a commentary on past rulings that such self-evidentoutcomes constitute progress, but you have to startsomewhere. And it is impressive that two of the rulingscommanded 8-1 majorities, while the third drew only twodissents. Even some of the more liberal members of the court,it seems, are starting to sense that the court risks losingpublic support if it operates in some hypertechnical andincomprehensible netherworld.   The rules of evidence, for example, bewilder almost anyonlooker. The fundamental problem is the exclusionary rule,which makes the test of &quot;evidence&quot; not truth but the mannerin which it was seized. At the time this rule was propounded,Justice Cardozo remarked on its essential silliness, &quot;Becausethe constable has blundered, the criminal shall go free.&quot; Inaddition, the rule gave the Supreme Court the quixotic taskof finding the precise line police may not cross.   Terry Brice Horton, for example, was convicted of holdingup the treasurer of a San Jose coin club, stunning him withan electrical device and taking cash and coins worth $30,000.The victim said he recognized Horton's voice, and police gota warrant to search his apartment. They failed to find theloot, but did find two stun guns. Their warrant listed coinsbut not the guns. Was it constitutional to tell the juryabout the stun guns? Yes, the court said, with JusticesBrennan and Marshall dissenting.   Lloyd Perkins was convicted of a murder he confessed,while jailed on an unrelated charge, to an undercovernarcotics agent. The agent was introduced into his cell afteranother inmate said Perkins had talked of the killing, andthe Miranda warning was not read until after the confession.Was it constitutional to tell the jury what Perkins said tothe agent? Yes, the court ruled, with even Justice Brennanjoining the majority, leaving Justice Marshall to dissentalone.   When it comes to religion in the public schools, the courtgets to count angels on pinheads. A moment of silence is anunconstitutional prayer, it has divined. This set of rulingshas also bewildered onlookers and left much of the publicsuspicious and resentful at what it saw as an attempt toexpel religion from public life. Indeed, public schoolofficials in Omaha might be forgiven for believing they wereobligated to refuse an application for a Christian Biblestudy club as an extracurricular activity. But in 1984Congress passed a law saying public high schools acceptingfederal aid must not discriminate against groups based on&quot;the religious, political, philosophical or other content ofthe speech at such meetings.&quot; Despite opposition from groupssuch as the National School Boards Association, the Courtheld that the law was within Congress's right, and meant whatit said. Justice Stevens dissented.   Surely there are other ways to keep students from beingcoerced into prayer against their own beliefs, andauthorities other than the Supreme Court who can see theright thing to do. There even are other ways to disciplinepolice excesses, especially now that segregationist Southernsheriffs are no longer the rule. The Supreme Court invitesendless agony and erodes its own standing when it invokes theConstitution to decide every detail of public life, and it'scomforting to see the court back away.</TEXT></DOC>
