But it's still waiting for similar commitments from other allies.    Norway, responding to a U.S. appeal, has announced its intention to enact major reforms in its export-control system. The planned changes include extending export controls to cover transfer of technical knowledge and services. The country's current law applies only to exports of physical products. Norwegian Trade and Shipping Minister Kurt Mosbakk also assured the U.S. that the new law would stiffen criminal penalties to deter potential violators.    Meanwhile Japan, in an apparent reversal of an earlier stance, announced plans to consider revising its own export-control laws and to expand the staff of a Ministry of International Trade and Industry unit charged with enforcing these statutes.    Both Norway and Japan are trying to stave off trade sanctions that Congress could slap on them for their part in the unauthorized shipments to the Soviet Union of technology that would allow the production of &quot;quiet&quot; submarines that are difficult to track.    U.S. officials acknowledged, however, that they have yet to hear similar pledges from other members of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, the Paris-based panel created to harmonize the export-control policies of the U.S. and its allies. Cocom is discussing possible concerted actions at a closed-door meeting in Paris this week.    Of the 17 Cocom members, the U.S. operates the most rigorous export-control program. Britain and France make comparable efforts, but other members fall short of U.S. standards, American officials say.    For instance, U.S. officials are urging West Germany to revise certain provisions of its trade laws that effectively confer on its citizens the right to export goods as they please. Such provisions make it hard for German authorities to enforce Cocom bans on exports to the Soviet bloc.    The U.S. also is trying to persuade Belgium to augment its tiny staff of export-control officers. And it's urging Greece to fill up certain gaps in its export laws.    Although the U.S. is pleased with Japan's latest commitments, it's less happy about Tokyo's meager contribution to Cocom's upkeep. The U.S. is urging Japan to raise its contribution -- currently only $40,000 a year, a small fraction of the U.S. contribution -- to a level commensurate with the volume of its trade. </TEXT></DOC>
