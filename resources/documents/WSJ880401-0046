Mr. Bloom will be sentenced before federal Judge David N. Edelstein May 12. He faces a maximum five years in prison for each of the two counts. He also could be fined as much as twice the amount investors lost, which the government currently estimates at $10 million.    Earlier this year, Mr. Bloom settled civil charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning the diversion of the money. Without admitting or denying the allegations, he agreed not to violate securities laws and agreed to be barred for life from the securities industry.    Mr. Bloom operated through Greater Sutton Investors Group Inc., which had about 130 clients, although he never registered with the SEC, the agency said. The identities of the investors who gave him money haven't been disclosed.    A court-appointed receiver will consign to the auction house Sotheby's Holdings Inc. certain of Mr. Bloom's artworks for sale at a May American art auction in New York or at other sales. Whether the proceeds will fully reimburse investors isn't clear.    In addition to the art, Mr. Bloom also turned over a Manhattan condominium; a house in East Hampton, N.Y.; a 1988 Aston Martin Valente, and a 1987 Mercedes-Benz 560 SEL. </TEXT></DOC>
