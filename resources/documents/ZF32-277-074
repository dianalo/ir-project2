 Touch's lead product is Touch OSI, a networkoperating system for DOS, Macintosh, and VMS computers.andP;  Using a VMS server,Touch OSI provides standard networking capabilities: file and print services,security, and terminal emulation support.andP;  Since it is an open system, TouchOSI is able to coexist with proprietary networks and will be able to connectwith other OSI standards-based systems.andM;Unfortunately for Touch, though, most users have systems up and running now:proprietary systems, perhaps, but systems that work nonetheless.andP;  And usershave applications running on those systems, applications necessary to theirbusinesses.andP;  Much as users would like to implement standards, they mustsupport the systems and applications they already have in place.andP;  They needfunctionality and compatibility, which come before desires for standards.andP;  Sousers will not buy a new system simply for the standards on which the systemis based.andP;  This contrast between users' needs and desires is reflected inTouch OSI's limited success in the marketplace.andM;NEW PRODUCT, NEW STRATEGY.andP;  Late last month, Touch introduced a new product.andO;The Touch Fastport/X.400 messaging software provides a connection betweenSMTP and UUCP users to X.400 systems.andP;  It is a software product that runsover any Unix Transport Library Interface (TLI) lower layer protocol stack orX.25 WAN.andM;The Fastport/X.400 includes source code, documentation, and engineeringservices.andP;  It is aimed at OEMs and System Integrators, but it is alsoavailable (in object code form) to end users.andP;  The Touch Fastport/X.400source code is modular and portable, this gives OEMs and System Integratorsthe ability to develop X.400 products for other software and hardwareenvironments.andM;More from Touch.andP;  Touch, however, is not leaving further developments of thissort of product solely up to other developers.andP;  Touch next intends to producea Microsoft Mail to Fastport/X.400 gateway.andP;  (Touch is familiar withMacintoshes--one of the computers supported by Touch OSI.)andP;  And Touch willproduce other gateways to the Fastport/X.400, providing support for otherelectronic mail systems.andM;Touch also plans to add further value to the Fastport/X.400 by includingsupport for X.500 standards.andP;  X.500's sophisticated directory services willbe difficult for developers to implement but valuable to users.andM;What's the Gestalt?andP;  This product set works together in an interesting way.andO;Instead of providing gateways from one proprietary system to another, Touchis providing gateways from individual proprietary systems to an OSI standard.andO;So, instead of having to write gateways for each proprietary system to everyother system, one gateway per system is sufficient.andM;Touch is, in effect, producing a black box.andP;  Each proprietary system's outputis turned into X.400 in the black box, then converted to another proprietaryformat or sent on to another X.400-based system (see illustration, above).andO;The black box provides connectivity while remaining transparent to the user.andM;As we said earlier, users would like a standards-based system, but they needa system that provides functionality.andP;  Touch is developing a system thathappens to use OSI standards and that will provide the mail connectivity thatusers need.andP;  The system is standards based as well as functional, so usershave extra incentives for buying this system over another functional,non-standards-based one.andM;Touch's Strategy.andP;  Touch seems to be pursuing a new strategy with theseproducts.andP;  Instead of providing another OSI standards-based networkingsystem, Touch has introduced a particular interconnectivity solution based onone OSI aplication standard: X.400.andP;  (Standards alone might not sell aproduct, but standards will help to sell a functional product.)andP;  And, insteadof providing end-user networking products, Touch is producing products aimedat OEMs and VARs.andP;  As Touch completes more parts of its black box, however,it will probably aim the product toward end users.andM;CONCLUSION: IMPLEMENTING STANDARDS.andP;  It is difficult for companies like Touchto try to introduce new standards-based systems (like Touch OSI) whenexisting proprietary systems (like Novell or 3Com) are already in widespreaduse.andP;  Users can't give up current functionality for standards, even thoughthey know that the standards will be useful in the future.andM;(Only when the government mandates a standard is it possible to implementthat standard quickly.andP;  Vendors can afford to move faster towards thatstandard because there is money to support a fast transition.)andM;How Can We Use Standards Now?andP;  Standards can be used effectively even whilethe computer industry at large is only starting to accept them.andP;  Touch's useof OSI standards to provide interconnectivity among proprietary systemsillustrates this opportunity.andM;We have proprietary systems, we want to be able to connect those systems, andso we develop standards.andP;  But we can't drop our proprietary systems entirelyand rebuild with standards-based systems.andP;  So we use standards-based productsto give us the connectivity we currently need.andP;  Then, as more standards-basedsystems enter the market, we will be able to continue to connect our olderproprietary systems to the newer ones, thanks to the connectivity products.andO;Functionality is maintained while standards begin to be implemented--a user'sdreams come true!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
