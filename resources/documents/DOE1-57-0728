The human DNA sequencespresent in primary, secondary, and tertiary NIH 3T3 transformants encompassabout 32 kilobases (kb) and contain four rearrangements with respectto normal human DNA and a portion of the c-fms protooncogene (FMS inhuman gene nomenclature). However, the minimal transforming region (6.6kb) identified in our cloned DNA borders on the c-fms DNA region butdoes not contain c-fms coding sequences. The fms sequences are also notrepresented in the two transcripts ({approx} 1.2 and 3.5 kb) detectedin NIH 3T3 transformants; however, they might provide elements regulatingexpression. Hybridization to several known oncogene probes and preliminarysequencing data indicate that we have identified a previously unrecognizedactivated oncogene. Since the rearrangements present in our cloned DNAsequences are not detectable in the original Kaposi tumor DNA used fortransfection, it is possible that this oncogene was generated duringgene transfer.</TEXT></DOC>
