Tungsten with porosities up to 35% has been investigated, supplyingthe cesium coverage by diffusion through the body from a heated reservoir.A test diode has been designed by computer simulation, achieving extremelyhigh current densities by a convex emission surface. In dc mode of operation,the obtained ion current density of 8 mA/cm/sup 2/ compares well withdata from literature, whereas the electron emission was negligible. Inpulsed operation, however, electron densities of up to 512 A/cm/sup 2/have been obtained for pulses as long as 100 {mu}s. Even more surprisingis an increase of the emitted ion current density to 200 mA/cm/sup 2/for up to 0.8 ms.</TEXT></DOC>
