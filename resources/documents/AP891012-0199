Technicians are working in minus 40-degree temperatures areattempting to clean up the mess.   Jack Renirie, a spokesman for the National Science Foundationwhich directs the U.S. Antarctic research, said Thursday thatexperts have not ruled out sabotage as a cause.   He said the leaks occurred ``in as many as seven'' of 10rubberized bladders used to store jet fuel, diesel fuel andgasoline at Williams Field, an aircraft landing strip five milesfrom McMurdo Station, the principle U.S. research and supplystation in the Antarctic.   ``We've used these tanks at several locations in the Antarcticand we've never had leaks from seven tanks simultaneously,'' saidRenirie.   ``Nobody has used the word sabotage,'' he said. ``Not yet.''   The summer reasearch season is just beginning at McMurdo, andabout 400 people are now working there. At the peak of the season,about 800 scientists, engineers, technicians and workers will liveat the station for the warmer months of the Antarctic year.   Renirie said the leaky tanks are in a storage area that issurrounded with protective dikes made of ice. He said the fuel isthought to have leaked and then filtered down through snow to anice layer about 30 feet below the surface, forming a subsurfacepool of about 180 feet long by 60 feet wide.   The estimate of the amount of fuel leaked comes from recordsthat indicate a shortage of about 50,000 gallons, he said.   McMurdo and Williams Field are located on the Ross Ice Shelf, adeposit of ice several thousand feet thick that forms a large partof the apparent surface of the Antarctic continent. Williams Fieldis used as a major supply depot for all of the U.S. operations inthe South Polar area, including stations at the South Pole and atPalmer Station on the Ross Sea.   The ice where Williams is located is considered stable andRenirie said it will not move to the sea for years. As aconsequence, he said, there is little danger that the spilled fuelwill end up in the ecologically fragile ocean waters around theAntarctic.   ``We expect that the environmental impact will be minimal whenwe get it out of there and tanked up,'' he said. ``It (spilledfuel) could be confined to the area just under the tanks for sometime.''   Renirie said workers are attempting to dig snow away from thetanks to find and repair the leaks. They then will start thecleanup.   ``They will pump out the fuel and slush and put it on a tankersled and take it back to McMurdo for disposal,'' he said. Thetanker sled holds about 3,000 gallons, he said, which means anumber of trips will be required.   The clean up workers must contend with temperatures dippingregularly to a minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the spokesman said.   No method has yet been chose for disposal of the fuel, saidRenirie.   The fuel spill is the second in recent weeks at U.S.installations at Antarctica. Earlier, personnel at theAmundsen-Scott Station at the South Pole found that severalthousand gallons of diesel fuel had leaked from a pipe that carriedthe fuel to a generator. Officials said then that the fuel draineddown though the porous snow covering the South Pole and pooled deepunder the surface. No attempt was made to clean up that spill.   On Jan. 28, an Argentine ship called the Bahia Paraiso ranaground near Palmer Station and spilled about 200,000 gallons offuel and lubricants into the ocean. About 64,000 gallons remainaboard the Bahia Paraiso. The ship was abandoned and remainsaground, leaking small amounts of fuel.</TEXT></DOC>
