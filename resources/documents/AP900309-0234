Digital officials would not give specific figures on how manyemployees might be cut, saying the plan was still being prepared.But Brad Allen, manager of shareholder relations, said the numberwas ``in the ballpark'' of previously estimated figures.   Industry analysts have said Digital, which employs about 125,900people worldwide and more than 70,000 in the United States, wantsto pare its staff by at least 5,000 and eventually redeploy as manyas 15,000 employees in new jobs.   ``The momentum has picked up, the program definitely will beexpanded,'' Allen said, adding the program was to be implemented bythe end of the company's fiscal year on June 30.   Digital spokeswoman Nikki Richardson said the program will besimilar to a package offered last year to 700 employees at thecompany's manufacturing plant in Salem, N.H.   In that plan, which has been accepted by 260 workers so far,employees choosing to participate received a cash payment based onyears of service, as well as medical, dental and life insurancecoverage for one year.   Workers with up to two years of service, for example, received40 weeks of pay. Those with three to 10 years got 40 weeks, plusthree weeks for each year between three and 10 years.   ``We are looking at all transition programs on abusiness-by-business basis,'' Richardson said. ``What isimplemented will be based on the Salem model.''   Digital, the world's second-largest computer company behindInternational Business Machines Corp., saw its earnings fall 39percent for the six months ended Dec. 31.   The company, based in suburban Maynard, blames the drop on alackluster computer market in the United States, which has forcedother companies to make cutbacks as well.   Digital also has reassigned hundreds of employees frommanufacturing to sales.</TEXT></DOC>
