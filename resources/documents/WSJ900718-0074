The maker of control systems had net income of $99.1million, or $2.58 a share, up 32% from $74.8 million, or$1.73 a share, the year earlier. Profit from continuingoperations climbed 54% to $92.4 million, or $2.40 a share,from $60 million, or $1.39 a share.

New tax regulations reduced the tax the company must payon the earlier sale of a portion of its stake in a Japanesejoint venture. The company said it had been projecting a 37%tax rate for 1990; as a result of the ruling, it lowered thatprojection to 30%. The adjustment allowed the company to paya tax rate of just 22%. Earnings would have been $1.96 ashare without benefit of the tax break.   Martin Sankey, First Boston Corp. analyst, noted thatHoneywell's earnings were &quot;operationally, modestly strongerthan expectations&quot; on Wall Street but that the tax advantageswere more of a surprise.   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,Honeywell shares jumped $3.50 to close at $110.50.   For more than a year, Honeywell has been streamliningoperations as part of a program to boost profitability. It ispursuing plans to spin off its defense business and hastrimmed its work force. One effect of the restructuring hasbeen to reduce interest expense, which in the latest periodfell 18% to $28.9 million.   Honeywell's industrial business showed a sharp increase inprofitability, as continuing strength in industrialautomation systems -- process control systems used infactories -- more than offset softer markets for theindustrial-parts business. Pretax earnings for the segmentrose to $60.5 million from $46.1 million.   The company's space and aviation business, which includescommercial flight systems, military avionics and spacesystems, showed an even stronger upturn, with pretax profitincreasing to $52 million from $29 million.   Honeywell noted that orders for the segment, excludingresults from units disposed of since last year, &quot;were downmoderately,&quot; largely on a downturn in orders for spacesystems.   Weakness in U.S. residential building contributed to adecline in pretax earnings at the homes and buildingsoperation to $41.9 million from $42.8 million.</TEXT></DOC>
