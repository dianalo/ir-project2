Resolution on Higgins</HEAD><DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An official of the Iranian-backedHezbollah, or Party of God, today attacked the U.N. SecurityCouncil's call for the release of kidnapped U.S. Marine Lt. Col.William R. Higgins.   ``We denounce and condemn the U.N. Security Council whichaccepted to allow such an agent (Higgins) to confront our people,''said Abbas Mousawi, a ranking Hezbollah official.   ``The arrest (of Higgins) was in defense of our nation's honor,dignity and existence,'' Mousawi added in an interview with theweekly An-Nahar Arab and International magazine.   The Security Council on July 29 unanimously condemnedpolitically motivated kidnappings in the Middle East and appealedfor the immediate release of Higgins, who headed a 76-member U.N.observer group in south Lebanon.   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was abducted near the southernport city of Tyre on Feb. 17.   Higgins' pro-Iranian kidnappers, the underground Organization ofthe Oppressed on Earth, said April 21 that he was to be tried oncharges of spying for the United States.   The United States and the United Nations have denied the spyingcharge.   Bassam Abu Sharif, spokesman for the Palestine LiberationOrganization, said in an interview published July 8 that Higginswas planning an operation before his abduction to rescue eightAmerican hostages.   The 18 foreign hostages held by Hezbollah-affiliated factions inLebanon, in addition to the nine Americans, are three Britons, aWest German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and twounidentified men.   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Lebanese and foreign security officials believe that Hezbollah,made up of radical Shiite zealots loyal to Iran's AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini, is an umbrella for the hostage-holding groups.   Asked whether Hezbollah would help in the release of the foreignhostgages if it was asked to do so by Iran, Mousawi said: ``We arenot involved in this issue.'' He did not elaborate.</TEXT></DOC>
