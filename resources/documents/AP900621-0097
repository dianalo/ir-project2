(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge today delayed for at least 24hours the execution of a woman dubbed the ``Black Widow'' forkilling her husband and trying to kill other men in her life.   U.S. District Judge Patricia C. Fawsett in Orlando temporarilyblocked today's scheduled 12:01 p.m. electrocution of Judi Buenoanoat Florida State Prison near Starke.   The case went to federal court when a split state Supreme Courtrejected defense arguments Wednesday that Florida's electric chairhas a defect.   The judge issued the temporary delay and scheduled a hearing fortoday to review the workings of the electric chair, said RichardDoran, director of criminal appeals in the state attorney general'soffice.   The 24-hour postponement would begin after the hearing, unlessthe judge grants the appeal and extends the execution delay.   Ms. Buenoano, 47, could become the first women executed inFlorida's electric chair since it came into use in 1924, and the23rd person put to death in the state since the U.S. Supreme Courtlifted its ban on capital punishment in 1976.   Only one woman has been executed in the United States since theU.S. Supreme Court ruling. North Carolina executed Velma Barfieldby injection in 1984 for poisoning her boyfriend.   Prosecutors nicknamed Ms. Buenoano the Black Widow because ofher record of trying, in most cases successfully, to poison, blowup or drown the men in her life. She was condemened for the 1971fatal poisoning of her husband.   Her latest state appeal was based on the botched execution inFlorida of Jesse Tafero. Flames and smoke shot out from underTafero's hood May 4, and witnesses said he seemed to breathe andmove after two of the three jolts he was given.   Defense attorneys allege Tafero was burned alive and that Ms.Buenoano would suffer the same fate because a faulty electrode hasnot been fixed.   Such a fate, they argue, would violate the Constitution's ban oncruel and unusual punishment.   ``We are fully confident that we know what went wrong in thelast execution and it's been fixed,'' said Jon Peck, a spokesmanfor Gov. Bob Martinez.   The Department of Corrections concluded the problem withTafero's execution was the use of a synthetic sponge under theheadpiece instead of the usual natural sponge. Tafero did notsuffer because of it, and the sponge was replaced, the departmentsaid.   In Wednesday's 4-3 ruling, Florida's high court said the matterwas one for the executive branch of government and that the courtmust presume the Corrections Department would carry out its dutiesproperly.   ``One malfunction is not sufficient to justify a judicialinquiry into the Department of Corrections' competence,'' the courtsaid.   In a dissent, Justice Gerald Kogan said he found it difficult tobelieve the sponge was the main problem. He warned of a ``ghastlypossibility.''   In another dissent, Justice Rosemary Barkett said, ``To myknowledge this is the first time any court has ever held that it isthe executive branch that decides, without question or appeal, aconstitutional claim of cruel or unusual punishment.''   Ms. Buenoano was condemned for murdering her husband, Air ForceSgt. James E. Goodyear. His body was exhumed a decade later after acar bombing injured Ms. Buenoano's boyfriend.   She was also convicted of killing her 19-year-old paralyzed sonby pushing him from a canoe in 1980.   She was convicted of attempted murder in the car bombing and issuspected of using arsenic to kill a common-law husband in Coloradoin 1977.</TEXT></DOC>
