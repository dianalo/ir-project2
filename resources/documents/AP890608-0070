It was the first time a top Iranian leader has commented on theforeign hostages since the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini onSaturday. Under Khomeini, Iran supported pro-Iranian groups inLebanan which are believed to be holding most of the 15 foreignhostages, including nine Americans.   Responding to a recent appeal by President Bush to help gain therelease of U.S. hostages, Rafsanjani said that if ``the Americanswho have more influence than us on the Phalangists (right-wingChristians in Lebanon) take action in securing the release of ourhostages, then they can expect our help.''   Rafsanjani was referring to four Iranians who have been missingin Lebanon for nearly seven years. Although the four are widelybelieved to be dead, Iran has repeatedly tried to use them as abargaining chip with the United States.   In his other remarks during an unusual news conference withforeign reporters, Rafsanjani said it could take a long time toformally end the Iran-Iraq war and that Khomeini told him to improverelations with the Soviet Union. He also said Britain must take theinitiative to improve ties with Iran. According to British newsreports today, Iran will not withdraw Khomeini's February order thatMoslems seek out and kill the Salman Rushdie, author of ``TheSatanic Verses,'' but ``is prepared to let the matter drop.'' ManyMoslems believe the book defames Islam.   The four Iranians Rafsanjani referred to were seized byright-wing Christians in Beirut in 1982 during the Israeli invasion.They include Ahmad Motevaselian, commander of the contingent ofIranian revolutionary guards based in the Bekaa valley in eastLebanon; Embassy Charge d'Affaires Hussein Musavi and Kazem Akhavan,a correspondent for Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.   The fourth was their Lebanese Shiite Moslem driver, RastegarMoqadam, who also held an Iranian passport.   Pro-Iranian groups are believed to be holding 15 foreigners,including nine Americans. Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, is the longest held of theforeign hostages in Lebanon. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   On the 8{-year Iran-Iraq war, Rafsanjani, who is acting militarycommander, said Iran was not willing to make any concessions to Iraqin the peace talks. The U.N.-sponsored talks stalled soon after theystarted Aug. 25.   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying,``We are determined to put an end'' to the war. He said thestalement in peace talks may last for some time.   At his news conference, Rafsanjani quoted Khomeini as saying daysbefore he died that Iran should improve ties with the Soviet Union.Rafsanjani said he would visit the Soviet Union later this month butthat a date had not been set.   Rafsanjani said Khomeini told him to ```try to promote yourrelations with your big northern neighbor' and we will follow thispolicy drawn by the imam.''   Iranians refer to Khomeini as their imam, or spiritual leader. Hedied of a heart attack Saturday, 11 days after undergoing surgeryfor internal bleeding in his intestines. Rafsanjani was addressingforeign correspondents who gathered in Tehran for Khomeini's funeralTuesday.   In his will read to Parliament after his death, Khomeini singledout the United States for special criticism, but it also warned Iranagainst aligning itself with the communist bloc.   On Iran's relations with the neighboring Arab states in thePersian Gulf, Rafsanjani said: ``There is no problem on our side''for improving ties.   ``We have received positive signals from the Persian Gulf states,except Saudi Arabia,'' the speaker said.   Saudi Arabia severed ties with Iran in April 1988, complainingthat it supports terrorism and attempts to destabilize governmentsin the region. The Arab states backed Iraq against Iran in the gulfwar.   Strains developed again with Saudi Arabia after the kingdomannounced it was maintaining quotas introduced last year on thenumber of pilgrims allowed to attend the annual hajj, the pilgrimageto the Moslem holy cities of Mecca and Medina. More than 400 people,most of them Iranians, died in clashes between Saudi police anddemonstraters during the hajj in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
