It is Article 14, commonly known as the non-circumvention clause, and could present serious obstacles to our ability to defend Europe once the INF missiles are removed.    The reason is that Article 14 -- in conjunction with the treaty's vague provisions concerning what's banned -- may spawn a debate over what kinds of INF-capable systems may or may not be deployed in Europe at some point in the future. Unless the administration moves quickly to clarify the situation, Article 14 and the treaty's missile-definition provisions may become to the INF debate what Agreed Statement D was to the ABM Treaty last year on the Senate floor: the cause of a bitter dispute over interpretation of the treaty.    Agreed Statement D attempted to set out the guidelines for the eventual development and deployment of future systems -- those based on &quot;other physical principles&quot; not known at the time of the 1972 negotiations -- with ABM capabilities. The interpretation of that statement languished for a decade. Not until Ronald Reagan proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative did the U.S. begin to take a closer look at the ABM treaty to determine what kinds of ABM-capable systems would circumvent it.    What the administration discovered was, at best, a quagmire of uncertainty about whether the treaty banned the development of &quot;futuristic&quot; ABM systems. It was precisely this lack of any clarity on what the ABM treaty -- or, more specifically, Agreed Statement D -- had to say about &quot;future&quot; systems that prompted the protracted Senate debate last year over the treaty interpretation.    Interpreting the INF Treaty's various restrictions on future INF-capable systems may prove equally difficult.    Under Articles 2 and 7, for instance, only new missile types that are unarmed or dedicated to air defense are allowed, yet there's no definition of what a new &quot;type&quot; is. Could the Soviets take an existing missile, paint it a different color, claim it was unarmed and deploy it?    Under Article 14, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union agree that they will not assume any &quot;international obligations or undertakings which would conflict with its provisions.&quot; There is, however, no explanation accompanying Article 14 to clarify what kinds of &quot;international obligations or undertakings&quot; might conflict with the treaty or even what the term &quot;conflict&quot; means in the context of the treaty.    Yet the interpretation of Article 14 is absolutely crucial to the future defense of Europe.    Is, for example, a NATO decision to modernize the outdated Lance missile (a tactical nuclear missile not banned by the INF Treaty) and extend its range to nearly 500 kilometers an &quot;undertaking&quot; that would &quot;conflict&quot; with the treaty's provisions? The Soviets have already hinted publicly that they might object to such a Lance follow-on -- that it would violate at least the intent and spirit of the INF treaty. Will the Soviets formally object to a follow-on Lance nuclear missile -- which NATO's supreme commander has said is critical to the defense of Europe once the INF missiles are removed -- and use Article 14 as the basis of their objection?    More important, will NATO capitulate before the Soviets even formally object? From what I've seen of NATO's and the Pentagon's post-INF plans, I fear that this is precisely what may occur.    It shouldn't. Given the growing East-West military imbalance, it seems clear that NATO must abide by the decision its defense ministers made in 1983 at Montebello, Canada, to reduce but modernize its tactical nuclear deterrent.    Whether NATO has the political will to modernize its remaining nuclear deterrent -- especially if it is faced with Soviet challenges on the no-circumvention issue -- remains to be seen. But the need to implement the Montebello decision must be pushed aggressively by U.S. leaders.    Beyond the Lance, what about possible future systems that overlap with the current INF mission in Western Europe? Will Article 14 -- in conjunction with Articles 2 and 7 -- keep NATO from deploying additional cruise missiles (either nuclear or non-nuclear) or dual-capable aircraft? And what about the deployment of a hypersonic boost glide vehicle -- which is a crossbreed between a cruise and ballistic missile -- and other hypervelocity weapons still being researched?    In addition, what will the Soviets say if the British and French develop their own nuclear arsenals using guidance systems similar to those in the banned INF missiles? Is this an &quot;undertaking&quot; by the U.S. that &quot;conflicts&quot; with the treaty?    I don't know the answers to these questions. And, based on testimony during the first few days of INF hearings, I don't think the administration knows yet either. The Defense Department, genuinely stumped, is groping for answers. The State Department meanwhile apparently believes there is no problem.    What we do know, however, is that the ability to deploy such &quot;smart&quot; weapons systems based on new or emerging technology will be critical to Europe's safety after the INF missiles are gone.    We also know that, during the lengthy negotiations over the INF forces in Europe, the Soviets pressed American negotiators quite hard on Article 14. In fact, it is my understanding that the Soviets demanded a list of specific types of future INF-capable systems that could not be deployed because, in their view, they circumvented the treaty. While the U.S. apparently did not capitulate to those Soviet demands, the resulting language dealing with the issue -- in Articles 2, 7 and 14 -- may still present considerable problems for future administrations. These problems are aggravated even further by the treaty's vague descriptions of how existing cruise and ballistic missiles will be destroyed and monitored.    The Senate must have a clear understanding of what these and other vague or ambiguous provisions mean before it consents to the INF treaty. The U.S. needs to know whether this treaty prohibits the development of certain kinds of future INF-capable systems and whether both sides have agreed to such a ban.    If there is any question about what Article 14 or any other provision prohibits, then it is only fair that we express this uncertainty both to the Soviets and our own defense planners, who are even now developing a new military strategy for the NATO alliance.    ---   Sen.
