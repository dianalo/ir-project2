Even in a country as supportive of the U.S. role as Egypt,the suggestion of long-term foreign military involvement inthe Gulf is viewed as ominous and plays into the hands ofpolitical forces already suspicious that the U.S. is onlyafter oil or control of the strategic region.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It wasn't a bright idea on the part of the Americans toraise it at this time,&quot; says Akmed Kamal Abul-Magd, anEgyptian lawyer and academic. &quot;It's very alarming. It's mostdestructive and most divisive.&quot;   Secretary of State James Baker broached the concept of along-term U.S. presence as an element of a regional securitystructure, partly to pacify critics at home who were pressingofficials to come up with long-range plans after the hastybuildup of a U.S.-led Western and Arab military force inSaudi Arabia. But instead of reassuring Arabs, it soundedalarm bells in certain quarters in countries near theconflict. Now, to recover from its tactical blunder, U.S.officials are promising to remove the troops as soon as theyaren't needed any longer.   But the mixed signals have stirred sentiments in Arabsociety that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is trying tosubdue. To forge an Arab military coalition to confront Iraqafter its Aug. 2 invasion and occupation of Kuwait, Mr.Mubarak had to maneuver around a split among Arab nationsover the use of foreign troops to defend Saudi Arabia. InsideEgypt, while there is near-unanimous condemnation of theinvasion of Kuwait, the public is divided over the deploymentof foreign troops on Saudi soil. Even the Islamic movement issplit over the presence of Western &quot;infidels&quot; in the land ofMoslem's holiest shrines.   The balance of support still tips strongly in favor of Mr.Mubarak's pivotal decision to deploy Egyptian soldiers aspart of an Arab force to defend Saudi Arabia against possibleIraqi attack. But Mideast experts say a permanent securityforce raises more troubling issues.   &quot;Arabs wouldn't welcome a long-term presence,&quot; said anEgyptian official privy to foreign-policy decision-making,&quot;because the Arab mind turns in a conspiratorial way.&quot;Unlikely as it may seem to Americans, many Arabs would tendto think the U.S. somehow contrived to create the Kuwaiticontroversy to win a toehold in the oil-rich region, he said.   Any security arrangement, the official said, &quot;has toemanate from the important powers in the region,&quot; namelyEgypt and Saudi Arabia, even if it ultimately relies oninternational military help. The sentiment suggests that U.S.officials will have to play down talk of securityarrangements for the Gulf at least until the immediate crisis-- the occupation of Kuwait -- is over.   Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, publicly blasting Mr.Baker's plan, last week called for a &quot;holy war&quot; against theU.S. presence in the region. Mr. Mubarak hasn't made an issueof long-term security arrangements, but his government issubtly trying to calm resentment stirred by the presence offoreign forces.   For example, government-controlled Egyptian televisionreran a show in which a popular TV-personality cleric, SheikMohammed Metwalli Sharawi, talked about how even the prophetMohammed, father of the Moslem faith, relied on non-believersfor arms and for guidance through the desert. And whenWestern news reports recently seemed fixated on theU.S.-Soviet summit in Helsinki, Finland, Cairo radio led itsnewscasts with a statement by President Bush calling thedeployment of U.S. troops in the Gulf &quot;temporary.&quot;   President Bush himself appeared to go out of his wayyesterday to defuse Arab concern about the U.S.'s long-termintentions. In speaking to reporters about U.S. forces inSaudi Arabia, Mr. Bush said: &quot;I want those soldiers out assoon as possible. I want them all out -- all out, period.&quot;But the president then added: &quot;And yet, I can't say when thatwill be.&quot;   In a further sign of its struggle to present a unitedfront, the Egyptian government last week barred severaljournalists and opposition party members who object to thepresence of foreign troops in Saudi Arabia from traveling toJordan for a conference with Arabs sympathetic to IraqiPresident Saddam Hussein.   Arabs' deep-seated disdain for foreign militaryinvolvement in the region is rooted in sour memories offoreign domination by the Turks, French and British and fearsthat foreign occupiers will pursue their own specialinterests, such as ensuring the flow of Middle Eastern oil tothe outside world.   &quot;It also touches on something very deep in the heart ofMoslems,&quot; says Ibrahim Shoukry, an opposition leader whoseparty is allied with the religious Moslem Brotherhoodmovement and who was one of those barred from going toJordan. &quot;Jews {in the U.S. armed forces} will be defendingthe Islamic holy land.&quot;   At least among moderate Arab intellectuals, discussionsare beginning not just on the need for regional securityarrangements but also on new long-term economic, politicaland social arrangements. &quot;If the Arabs don't come up withsome solutions, others will come up with something for them,&quot;warns a leading political analyst, Ali Dessouki of CairoUniversity. &quot;Arabs have to get their acts together.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
