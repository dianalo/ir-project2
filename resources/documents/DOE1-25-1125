Information gained from these wells, inthe form of temperature and pressure, has been used to attempt to conceptualizerecovery mechanisms and calculate heat balances. Assumptions must bemade to distinguish hot water from steam to qualitatively and quantitativelyanalyze observation well data. Often completion methods used to obtainpressure information effectively mask some temperature data and, as pressureand temperature data are required to ascertain the existence of steam,some information is sacrificed to gain steam information. The paper describesthe principles and algorithms for distinguishing live steam zones fromhot water zones at observation wells using temperature gradients andindependent of pressure information. If sufficient data exists, the analysiscan be represented in real time video display to yield qualitative analysisof steam zone conformity. Knowledge of the growth and shape of live steamzones can be useful in conceptual project design for well spacing, patternorientation, aspect ratios and completion intervals. Distinction of hotwater zones from live steam zones can provide insight into changing recoverymechanisms over the life of a project. 4 refs., 6 figs.,</TEXT></DOC>
