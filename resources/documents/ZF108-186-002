Rooker Jr., IBM vice president for national federalmarketing, said in a cover letter.andM;&quot;The committee staff paper continually stretches to insinuate improperactivity, but it fails to provide any substantive evidence in support of itsinsinuations.&quot;andM;The Navy is working on its response to the memo.andP;  A spokesman, Lt.andP;  Jim Wood,said the service would respond by next month.andM;Committee staff did not return telephone calls seeking their response toRooker's letter.andM;The committee also is expected to begin hearings soon as charges that theNational Institutes of Health unfairly favored IBM in acquisitions.andM;The same six vendors -- PacificCorp Pacital Inc., Amdahl Corp., Memorex TelexCorp., NCR Comten, Storage Technology Corp. and Vion Corp. -- that made theallegations against the Navy also made similar charges against the NIH.andM;In its response, IBM repeatedly denied the committee's charges that allowingNavy contracting officials to attend training seminars without paying tuitionconstituted gratuities.andP;  The staff memo said the company may have brokenbribery laws and accused IBM of &quot;blantant disregard for the application ofrelevant law or regulation.&quot;andM;IBM called the allegations &quot;preposterous&quot; because Navy officials who attendedIBM's Data Processing Executive Institute in San Jose, Calif., paid all theirown transportation, lodging and meal expenses.andM;The company also denied allegations of bias and of improperly influencingNavy procurements.andP;  The response attacked the committee's interpretations ofreports from the General Accounting Office and the Defense Departmentinspector general, as well as decision from the GSA Board of ContractAppeals.andM;The staff memo said two BSBCA protests were &quot;successful protests based on IBMbias allegations.&quot;andP;  The first protest, in which NCR Comten challenged therequest for proposals for the Navy's Data Processing Installation EquipmentTransition Phase 3, was settled.andM;PacifiCorp also protested the DPI-ET RFP.andP;  In that case the GSBCA directedthe Navy to scrap its solicitation and split the buy into two parts.andP;  But&quot;nowhere in Judge [Rober W.] Parker's opinion is an allegation of bias towardIBM even mentioned, much less given any weight as evidence,&quot; the IBM responsesaid.andM;IBM disagreed with the committee staff's conclusion that a GAO reportcondemning the Naval Standard Civilian Payroll System II acquisition asflawed showed Navy bias toward IBM.andP;  It also disputed the claim that a DOD IGfinding that the Naval Military Personnel Command Procurement was undulyrestrictive showed bias.andM;The staff memo also alleged IBM employees &quot;coached&quot; Navy officials in theirpreparations of solicitation documents.andP;  The IBM response denied aiding orpreparing draft specifications for specific procurements.andP;  Instead, it said,the company offered examples of publicly available specifications from othergovernment buys.andM;The committee staff also alleged that IBM misled the Navy on the DPI-ETprocurement by saying it would provide a low-end processor to other bidders.andM;A new IBM marketing representative did tell the Navy it would supply themachine, the IBM document said.andP;  Later, after IBM officials learned of themistake when competitors sought to buy the equipment, IBM negotiated with theNAvy and agreed to let DPI-ET bidders buy the machine through the GSAschedule, the response said.andM;The committee staff also claimed IBM violated the Buy American Act.andP;  Duringthe hearings, GSA officials disclosed that the agency's IG was investigatingallegations that IBM had supplied used machines as new and certifiedequipment as American-made when it included foreign-manufactured parts.andM;IBM's response said the company first reported the violations to GSA forcorrection.andM;&quot;IBM believes its voluntary disclosure of this matter confirms IBM's standingas an ethical and responsible contractor, rather than, as the committee staffimplies, a contractor seeking to cover up wrongdoing,&quot; the response said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
