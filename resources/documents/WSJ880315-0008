Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman said his agency, the Federal Reserve Board and the Comptroller of the Currency &quot;have begun working with (A. Robert) Abboud and his investor group to handle First City in an alternate fashion in the event the tender is not successful.&quot;    While stressing that their involvement with First City wasn't intended to put additional pressure on First City debt holders, the actions by FDIC officials would nonetheless have that effect. The FDIC has repeatedly said that the First City bailout is a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; proposition to existing First City investors. The alternative is to let the bank fail and leave these investors empty handed.    One option under study at the FDIC is allowing First City's banks to fail and merging them into a &quot;bridge bank,&quot; essentially a corporate shell to hold and operate an insolvent bank until it can be sold. Another option is for the holding company to enter bankruptcy proceedings voluntarily.    Either option could strip shareholders of their equity and leave creditors to share the proceeds of liquidation or sale of the assets. And either option could lead to a completion of the sale of First City's banks to the investor group led by Mr. Abboud.    Both Messrs. Abboud and Seidman are lobbying for the deal to go through as planned, though Mr. Abboud said he might extend the tender offer again; it was scheduled to expire today. Whatever alternative they may later take, Mr. Abboud said, &quot;we have no intention of changing the terms of the debt tender in a major monetary fashion.&quot; The FDIC has also ruled out bearing any more of the cost in the First City bailout.    Either way, Mr. Abboud vowed, &quot;There will be a transaction in one form or another. The only question is what form will that transaction take.&quot; He said he and his investment bankers have raised the $500 million to complete the deal by the end of the month. He added that he intends to take over First City without agreeing to pay more money to balky First City debt holders.    Mr. Abboud indicated that some existing First City debt holders seem to be intent on trying to kill the transaction by refusing to exchange their notes for discounted amounts of cash. The debt tender offer provides holders between 35 cents to 45 cents on the dollar for four issues. A week ago, as reported when the offer was extended, First City said it received tenders for only 41.4%, less than half the 90% minimum required by Mr. Abboud's plan. A total of $225.8 million in long-term debt is involved.    One other possibility would be to lower the minimum amount of debt required in the tender to less than 90%. Mr. Abboud doesn't specifically rule it out, but he opposes it because the cost of carrying more debt could depress his ambitious earnings forecasts for a recapitalized First City.    Mr. Abboud, when faced with opposition from some First City preferred stockholders, did an end-run around them to get shareholder approval of his plan earlier this month. As previously reported, Mr. Abboud revised First City's shareholder voting rules to effectively strip a minority of shareholders of the power to defeat the proposal. Mr. Abboud changed the rules so that a two-thirds majority of all classes of shareholders was required instead of a two-thirds majority of each class.    First City common shares closed unchanged at 56.25 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
