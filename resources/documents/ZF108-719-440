Brown, president of Bell Atlantic Europe S.A.andO;&quot;We are pleased to join with U S WEST in introducing high-quality businesscommunications services that will support Czechoslovakia's move to amarket-based economy.&quot;andM;Steven Andrews, president of U S WEST International, said: &quot;This agreement,along with our plans for a cellular system, will greatly enhanceCzechoslovakia's communications capabilities.andP;  A modern data network willprovide the communications services necessary to help the economy of theCzech and Slovak Federated Republic grow and expand.&quot;andM;Besides U S WEST International, which markets the company's services in theinternational marketplace, U S WEST also owns companies involved worldwide inradio communications, including cellular, paging and Personal CommunicationsNetworks; cable television; business telecommunications products andservices; data solutions, and financial services.andM;Bell Atlantic Corp. is the Philadephia-based parent of telephone companiesserving more than 17 million customers in the mid-Atlantic region of theUnited States and companies that provide cellular communications, computermaintenance, and financial and leasing services in U.S.andP;  and internationalmarkets.andP;  The company had 1989 assets of $26.2 billion.andM;With more than 900 employees today living and working in 14 countries outsideNorth America, Bell Atlantic expanded its overseas activities last week withthe announcement that it, Ameritech and two New Zealand companies were thewinning bidders to purchase New Zealand's state-owned telephone company.andO;(EDGE 6/18/90).andM;EDGE Commentary: Meanwhile, back at the ranch, here in New Jersey, where EDGEoriginates, we tried to get a quote from New Jersey Bell three weeks ago forISDN service.andP;  After waiting two days for a callback from someone&quot;knowledgeable,&quot; we were told that frankly, NJ Bell didn't have a tarrif,didn't expect to get one for about a year and therefore couldn't provide aprice quote.andM;We thought that divestiture mean't that the RBOC's had to invest in makingimprovements in their respective, American regions.andP;  Making those Regulatedportions of the U.S.andP;  more modern and responsive to their Guaranteed,Monopoly customer base.andP;  We thought.andM;But, it seems that every one of the RBOC's is involved with one scheme oranother that, on the surface, doesn't have a darn thing to do with theirassigned Region.andP;  If it isn't an undersea cable (both coasts), its nationalpaging or cellular or wiring the Shanghai Center in China.andP;  But they alwaysprotest the slightest hint of competition to local competition for telephoneservice (NYNEX vs Teleport).andM;They all seem to want to play outside their &quot;assigned&quot; Regions, with theircustomer's money.andP;  Sure, the RBOCs have reduced rates over the past fewyears.andP;  But that's a token to the regulators.andP;  How about a reduction inaccess charges to the long-distance carriers, ATandamp;T, MCI, Sprint, etc?andP;  Thenthey can &quot;pass on&quot; their savings to the public.andM;Well, not all of the savings.andM;It's a vicious circle.andP;  When ATandamp;T had a guaranteed rate of return, they spentevery dime in revenue on people and &quot;stuff&quot; and, improving the network, tomake sure they didn't exceed their ceiling.andP;  Now that they have Price-Caps,they're becoming &quot;efficient.&quot;andM;And the RBOcs want to manufacture?andP;  What? PBX's, modems, switches?andM;Then what?andP;  After they take over a few manaufacturers of telecom gear, whynot Chrysler or General Foods or Allstsate Insurance or ATandamp;T?andP;  Farfetched?andO;With the right lawyers, a little imagination, and a few &quot;strategicalliances,&quot; anything is possible.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
