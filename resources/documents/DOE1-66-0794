It uses a bag filter. To protect the filter against possible abnormalheat of blast furnace gas, a unique stepless gas temperature controlsystem is adopted for water spray for cooling. This permits operationat temperatures near the heat-resistant limit of the filter. Thus, thetemperature at the inlet of the top pressure recovery turbine (TRT) isincreased and the pressure loss in the dust removal system is decreased,resulting in an 11 percent increase in the TRT output. Unlike the conventionalwet type systems, the preheating of gas prior to the TRT is not required,leading to a great reduction in the running cost of the auxiliary facilities.Collected dust is screened and components with a high content of zincare separated, serving to control the amount and zinc concentration oflow-zinc dust components to be reused as sintering material. The systemhas been operating in good condition since its installation. (7 figs,3 tabs, 1 photo, 4 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
