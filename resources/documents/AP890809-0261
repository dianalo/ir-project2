(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cummins Engine Co. Inc. Wednesday said itamended provisions of its shareholders' rights plan to lower theamount of common stock a shareholder must own to be eligibile.   The amendment lowers from 25 percent to 15 percent the ownershipof the company's common stock that results in the rights kickingin, said Ann C. Smith, public relations director of Cummins, whichproduces diesel engines, components and power systems.   Ms. Smith said the amendment would have no immediate effect,since no one shareholder has acquired 15 percent of the company'scommon stock.   Last December, the U.S. arm of the British conglomerate HansonPLC announced it had acquired 8.32 percent of Cummins' commonstock, then filed for permission to increase its holdings up to 15percent.   Last month, Cummins' 80-year-old former chairman, J. IrwinMiller, and other family members bought back the shares to allayfears the engine-maker might be bought and moved.   Nine days later, Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., a HongKong-based investment concern, paid $60.2 million for 1.01 millionshares, or 9.9 percent of common stock. IEP filed for permissionfrom the Securities and Exchange Commission to increase its staketo between 15 percent and 25 percent.   IEP officials have said the purchase was made for investment andtakeover purposes.   ``All of these factors were considered by the board when itinacted the amendment,'' Ms. Smith said today.   The company adopted its shareholder rights plan three years agoand declared a dividend of one right per outstanding share ofcommon stock. When the rights become effective, they entitle theholder to buy one share of common stock for $200. Under certaincircumstances, the rights entitle the stockholder to purchase for$200 common stock with a market value of two times the purchaseprice.</TEXT></DOC>
