(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 20,000 coal miners in sixstates stayed off the job Friday in an expanding wildcat strike thatone union official said was being directed by United Mine WorkersPresident Richard Trumka.   Miners in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Virginia and Tennesseejoined the walkout, which began Monday in West Virginia in sympathywith 1,600 miners on strike in Virginia and West Virginia againstThe Pittston Coal Group.   UMW officials gave conflicting indications of whether they areresponsible for the wildcat strike, which the companies say violatesthe 1988 national contract the union signed with the Bituminous CoalOperators Association.   In Pennsylvania, 2,300 miners were on strike, less than 14percent of the state's total. UMW District 2 President Nick Molnarsaid union officials planned to tell each of the district's 52 localunions by telegram that their members should report to work asusual. Molnar said he could not predict whether the miners wouldobey.   But in Birmingham, Ala., District 20 international executiveboard member Tommy Buchanan said the final decision on whetherAlabama miners will join the strike will be with Trumka.   ``It might be two days. It might be a week. It will startwhenever it comes down from the union president,'' Buchanan said.   Buchanan said earlier there is a ``100 percent chance of asympathy strike'' by the district's 5,000 members.   Trumka did not return telephone calls Friday. UMW spokesman JoeCorcoran in Washington was not in his office and has not returnedphone calls this week.   About 5,000 miners on Friday attended a rally in Ebensburg, Pa.,near Johnstown. Meanwhile, in Hazleton, Pa., union officialsorganized miners who could leave on short notice from Trumka topicket in support of the Pittston strikers, said Bill Ray, District25 president and an acting member of the union's internationalexecutive board.   The walkout has affected about two-thirds of West Virginia's24,000 miners, industry officials estimated, including 2,500Consolidation Coal Co. miners and 1,000 Island Creek Coal Co.employees.   Some non-union mines and coal-related businesses, includingbarge-loading docks and power plants, also were hit by bands ofroving pickets.   About 650 Westmoreland Coal Co. workers went back to work inVirginia Friday, but about 790 Island Creek miners went on strike inthat state at the same time, company spokesmen said. Virginia hasabout 12,000 miners.   About 200 Consolidation miners at Arco, Tenn., joined the strikeon Friday, a company spokesman said.   At least 1,390 workers were off the job Friday at seven Indianamines. UMW Local 5179 leaders ordered workers to return to theirjobs at Old Ben Coal Co.'s No. 1 mine near Spurgeon, Ind., during ameeting Friday, but local president Jim Griffith said he was unsurewhether workers would obey the order. Company officials also refusedto comment.   Lester Weist, chairman of the local's mine committee, said themembers were ordered back to work because the work stoppage violatesthe contract.   ``No local issues are involved,'' he said. ``The stoppage was notinitiated on the local level, and at this point we're unsure of whatlevel it was initiated.''   He said union members on the midnight shift apparently receivedphone calls that they were on strike until further notice.   In Terre Haute, UMW District 11 spokesman Mark Arnold said theCBS television program ``48 Hours,'' whose program Thursday nightfocused on the Pittston strike, apparently sparked the Spurgeonminers to walk off the job.   About 290 miners at Peabody Holding Co.'s Camp No. 1 mine inMorganfield, Ky., didn't report for work Friday, company spokesmanTom Clarke said, but they represent less than 1 percent of thestate's 32,000 miners.   The largest contingent of striking miners in Pennsylvania was atthe Rochester andamp; Pittsburgh Coal Co. operations in centralPennsylvania, where 1,600 workers failed to show up, companyspokesman Hank Waneck said.   The original strike by West Virginia and Virginia miners began inApril when Pittston dropped out of the Bituminous Coal OperatorsAssociation to negotiate with the union independently. The two sideshave failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
