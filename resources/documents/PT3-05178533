In order      to procure a process and burner which may operate with a smaller      proportion of primary air and a greater range of adjustment, a dead zone      is provided at the center of the flame directly all around a central fuel      conduit and within an annular fuel supply conduit, in which a very small      proportion of fuel is sent. </PAL></ABST><PARN> <PAR>  This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/581,801,      filed Sept. 13, 1990, and now abandoned. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to a process for exploitation of a burner for      a rotary tube furnace, in which fuels and primary air are supplied      concentrically. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention also relates to a burner for a rotary tube furnace      equipped with a burner nozzle fitted with fuel and primary air conduits      which are disposed substantially concentrically with respect to one      another, which primary air includes air set in rotation and air flowing      axially. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  A burner of this type is disclosed in German Patent DE 2 905 746. </PAR><PAR>  This known burner comprises, in addition to a central fuel admission for      the oil, another fuel admission disposed concentrically thereto for      powdered coal or any other like fuel. </PAR><PAR>  For the purpose of obtaining a good mixture, this solid fuel admission lies      between two streams of primary air, of which one, which is the central      stream, is set in rotation or eddy, i.e. it comprises a component in      tangential or peripheral direction, and of which the other, outer, stream      comprises an essentially axial flow velocity for the purpose of      stabilizing the flame which penetrates far in the rotary furnace. </PAR><PAR>  In other known burners, the stream of primary air is also provided to      extend relatively far in the interior. </PAR><PAR>  The known burner comprises, at its centre, a liquid fuel, generally oil,      admission. The liquid fuel is atomized into fine droplets by means of a      spray nozzle and is mixed, after leaving the central opening of the      nozzle, with primary air which issues from the opening for outlet of      eddying air, which opening is located radially around the central opening. </PAR><PAR>  The known burners are usually employed with a proportion of primary air of      between 8% and 25% of the total quantity of combustion air. </PAR><PAR>  The power of the burner, i.e. the operational working, is regulated by a      respective reduction or increase of the fuel and the air admission within      a determined range of adjustment, in which the minimum adjustable working      for obtaining a stable flame is equal to about 20 to 25% of the maximum      working possible. </PAR><PAR>  When the burner is started, oil must, as a general rule, be injected      through the central orifice of the nozzle and must be ignited in order to      pre-heat the furnace, since combustion of the solid fuel, which is      supplied concentrically, is possible only in a sufficiently pre-heated      furnace. </PAR><PAR>  With respect to this state of the art, the present invention has for its      object to provide a process for exploiting a burner of a rotary tube      furnace and also a burner adapted to carry out this process, which may      operate with a smaller proportion of primary air and present a broader      range of adjustment of the operational working. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  As far as the process is concerned, this object is attained by providing      directly all around a central fuel supply conduit and/or radially inside      an annular fuel supply conduit, a central dead zone in which, at the most,      a reduced proportion of the primary combustion air is sent. </PAR><PAR>  Thanks to the presence of a central dead zone, combustion thus begins at a      greater distance in front of the centre of the nozzle of the burner      compared with the heretofore known processes and burners </PAR><PAR>  In this way, seen in longitudinal section, starting from the centre of the      front end of the nozzle, the resultant flame comprises a central zone      which extends forwardly and radially, in which virtually no noteworthy      combustion of the fuel is produced with the oxygen of the air. </PAR><PAR>  It is true that such a central flame heart is also present in principle in      the known burners, whilst, according to the present invention, this      central dead zone is provoked deliberately and enlarged, more particularly      by the fact that the least primary air possible is supplied in this zone. </PAR><PAR>  However, even if it is not provided in the first place for combustion, a      small proportion of primary air may be supplied in this central zone, this      small proportion of primary air serving, however, in the first place to      stabilize the flame and to prevent a rearward return of the combustion      gases, the coal ash and the coke, which, without that, would lead to the      soiling of the central part of the nozzle. </PAR><PAR>  A small stream of primary air in this central zone, which is below 20% and      preferably below 10% of the total primary air, avoids such a rearward      return of the combustion products, without supplying much oxygen which      would reduce the central zone rich in fuel. </PAR><PAR>  It has been unexpectedly found that, thanks to the presence of such      enlarged central dead zone, the range of adjustment of the burner may be      considerably increased, up to less than 10% of the maximum working for      which the burner is designed. </PAR><PAR>  Insofar as such a burner must operate especially with solid and pulverized      fuels, this means that, after a brief pre-heating with oil, it may already      function with the solid fuel. </PAR><PAR>  At the same time, it has been shown that, in such a process and in a burner      designed for this process, the proportion of primary air which must be      used for stabilizing the flame may be reduced by 2 to 10% and preferably      below 6% with respect to the overall quantity of combustion air. This      facilitates manufacture of the primary air supply devices which may be      designed respectively weaker. </PAR><PAR>  A particular advantage of the reduced consumption of primary air resides in      the resulting saving of energy for an equal performance and also in the      reduction of the proportion of nitrogen oxides in the combustion gases. </PAR><PAR>  According to the invention, it is provided that, separately from the      introduction of a small proportion of primary air in the central zone, at      least two other separate streams of primary air are supplied, one of which      is essentially axial and the other has a major part of the flow components      in peripheral direction. </PAR><PAR>  As far as the device mentioned above is concerned, the object of the      invention is attained by locating the orifices for admission of the      eddying air and of the axial air, outside the orifices for admission of      the fuel, and the minimum radial distance with respect to the centre of      the nozzle of the burner from the outlet orifices for the eddying air and      the axial air, is at least equal to twice the radius of a central orifice      of the flame stabilizer. </PAR><PAR>  The flame stabilizer comprises a flange which surrounds a central opening,      and which is located at the centre of the nozzle of the burner and,      preferably at the end of a nozzle-holder for the oil. It contributes to      forming and stabilizing the flame. The flame stabilizer which projects      radially with respect to the central nozzle-holder for the oil, thus      procures a sufficient radial distance from the other annular openings for      the primary air and/or other fuels which are located radially outside the      flame stabilizer. </PAR><PAR>  The radii of the central opening of the flame stabilizer and of the annular      orifice for the principal stream of primary air located more to the inside      are chosen, with the result that the inner stream of primary air lies at a      distance from the centre of the nozzle which corresponds to at least      double the central opening of the flame stabilizer. In this way, the      central opening of the flame stabilizer corresponds substantially to the      orifice of the nozzle of the central fuel conduit. </PAR><PAR>  In this way, the fuel issuing centrally does not come into contact too soon      with the oxygen of the principal streams of primary air. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, in the preferred embodiment of the invention, there is      provided in addition an annular conduit for a solid and/or gaseous fuel,      disposed radially inside the primary air conduit and radially outside the      flame stabilizer. </PAR><PAR>  The expression &quot;primary air conduit&quot; generally refers to the major part of      the primary air which is supplied axially or in eddying form and must not      cover the small proportion of primary air (central air) which is supplied      in the central zone of the flame to avoid the rearward return of the      combustion products. </PAR><PAR>  For the supply of this latter small proportion of primary air, according to      the invention, openings are provided in the flame stabilizer, outside the      central opening. </PAR><PAR>  The circulation of this small part of primary air takes place in an annular      conduit included between the central support of the oil nozzle and the      following inner wall in radial direction for another admission of fuel or      for one of the principal streams of primary air. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, it is advantageous if the outlet opening for the axial air      stream lies as far to the outside as possible in the radial direction and      if it presents, furthermore, an axially projecting outer edge. </PAR><PAR>  This outer ring contributes to a better constancy of the axial direction of      the air, with the result that combustion is improved and the flame is      stabilized. </PAR><PAR>  According to the invention, the annular conduits for supplying primary air      and/or solid or gaseous fuel, have conical walls and these walls as well      as the concentric tubes connected thereto are axially displaceable with      respect to one another, so that the free transverse section of the annular      passage can thus be adjusted. </PAR><PAR>  However, the ends of each conduit are preferably cylindrical in order to      avoid a divergent flow parallel tc the direction of the conical walls. </PAR><PAR>  According to the invention, in the conical part of the annular conduit for      the axial air, radial partitions are disposed, intended for the axial      orientation and for the circulation of the primary air in separate      channels, which are disposed on a ring and which extend essentially in      axial direction. </PAR><PAR>  These partitions contribute to an additional axial orientation of the      corresponding primary air and also increase the axial outlet velocity, in      that they reduce the free section of the annular conduit and they divide      it into a plurality of individual channels disposed all around a ring.      Moreover, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, some of these      channels are closed at least partly or are adjustable. To that end, the      partitions may for example be made sufficiently wide in peripheral      direction to obturate a channel at least partly or they correspond to a      closed channel. </PAR><PAR>  It is thus possible to obtain that the sum of the free sections of the      channels be less than the transverse section of the annular conduit for      the primary air flowing in axial direction. </PAR><PAR>  As has already been explained, the axial flow velocity of the air is thus      increased, which further contributes to stabilizing the flame. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, according to the invention, the flame stabilizer is provided      to be offset rearwardly in axial direction with respect to the openings      for outlet of the principal part of the primary air and the solid or      gaseous fuels. This may be effected for example by fixing the flame      stabilizer to the tube enveloping the pipe of the burner, which is axially      displaceable, which tube is consequently offset axially. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The invention will be more readily understood on reading the following      description with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is an overall view of a burner with part of the supply      installations. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2a is a longitudinal section through a first embodiment of a burner      nozzle. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2b is a partial left-hand view of FIG. 2a. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a longitudinal section through another embodiment of a burner      nozzle with possibility of supplying pulverized solid fuels. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a longitudinal section through a burner nozzle with additional      possibility of supplying a gaseous fuel. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a longitudinal section through a burner nozzle with additional      possibility of supplying a solid fuel and a gaseous fuel. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows a burner nozzle 1 placed at the      end of an outer burner tube 5&quot;, which is at the same time the outer wall      of a conduit 5' for primary air which flows in axial direction. </PAR><PAR>  At the other end of the outer tube 5&quot;, different supply devices are fixed      or connected by flanges. </PAR><PAR>  The axial air arrives via a tube 25, the eddying air arrives via a tube 24,      and these two primary air parts are adjustable separately by respective      valves 45 and 44 and are connected to the same principal primary air      conduit. At the rear end of the burner shown in FIG. 1, a conduit 22      branches from this principal primary air conduit and this branch      terminates in a tube which concentrically surrounds the tube enveloping      the burner pipe 10'. </PAR><PAR>  In this way, a small part of the primary air coming from the branch 22      flows through an annular conduit 11' and issues through openings 13 (cf.      FIG. 2b) in the central zone of the flame. A liquid fuel such as oil is      supplied centrally to the nozzle of the burner via conduit 21. </PAR><PAR>  A tube 23, which is intended for supplying pulverized solid fuels,      generally powdered coal, is connectted to the annular conduit 15' visible      in FIGS. 3 and 5. </PAR><PAR>  The concentric tubes 10&quot;, 11&quot;, 4&quot;, 5&quot;, 15&quot; and 19&quot;, which are engaged in      one another, have different lengths. The innermost tubes project axially      towards the rear beyond the outermost tubes, with the result that, as      shown in FIG. 1, adjusting devices 33, 34, 35 may be positioned which      allow a relative axial displacement of the tubes with respect to one      another. To that end, the individual tubes are connected to one another by      means of deformable gussets. </PAR><PAR>  A monitoring unit 30 serves to monitor and control the streams of primary      air. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2a shows a longitudinal section and FIG. 2b a partial front view of a      burner nozzle which is designed to operate exclusively with a fuel, for      example oil, arriving at the centre. </PAR><PAR>  The flame stabilizer 3, which is located at the end of tube 10', which      envelops the nozzle-holder pipe of the oil burner and which projects      radially with respect to the opening of the nozzle, guarantees that the      opening 4 of the annular supply conduit along 4' opens out at a      considerable radial distance from the central opening 2 of the flame      stabilizer. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment shown, the radial distance D of the annular opening 4      with respect to the axis of the burner is more than triple the radius d of      the opening 2. The corresponding distances are indicated in FIG. 4, in      which the ratio D/d is even greater. </PAR><PAR>  The zone located essentially in front of the flame stabilizer constitutes a      central dead zone 20, which is located outside the central fuel stream and      clearly within the principal admission of primary air issuing from the      annular openings 4 and 5. </PAR><PAR>  This dead zone may extend axially up to a multiple of the diameter of the      flame stabilizer. A mixture of the primary combustion air and of the fuel      sufficient for the formation of a flame is produced only outside this      central dead zone. The flame stabilizer comprises a hub in the form of a      flange surrounding a central orifice 2. This hub comprises small openings      13. The outer face of the hub, i.e. the front face, bears fins 12 which      guide the small proportion of primary air issuing from openings 13. </PAR><PAR>  The outer supply conduit 5' comprises at its end conical walls 6 which      diverge outwardly. In the zone of these walls 6 are located juxtaposed      partitions 6' which have a longitudinal section of triangular shape. These      triangular walls are juxtaposed along a common side which is parallel to      the axis of the burner and which is placed at the same radial distance      from this axis as the outer wall of the conduit 5'. </PAR><PAR>  In this way, it is possible to displace the tube 4&quot; axially with respect to      tube 5&quot; without the function of partitions 6' being influenced thereby. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2b shows a front view of the front edges of the partitions 6'. </PAR><PAR>  However, partitions 6' may also have, in peripheral direction, a sufficient      width for them to correspond to the parts located between the channels 5      shown in FIG. 2b. These parts may also be considered as closed channels 5. </PAR><PAR>  The supply conduit 4' comprises in front of the conical end, a device 14      for eddying the air, i.e. for setting it in rotation about the axis of the      burner. This device is essentially constituted by fins for guiding the air      which are oriented obliquely with respect to the axis of the burner.      Thanks to the axial displacement of tube 11&quot; with respect to tube 4&quot;, the      distance between the conical walls 7 of conduit 4' may be varied, with the      result that the transverse section of conduit 4' may thus be modified. The      terminal part of conduit 4' in the zone of opening 4 is, however, again      cylindrical in order to avoid a divergent flow of the eddying air issuing      from this opening. </PAR><PAR>  Similarly, edge 8, which projects forwardly in axial direction, procures an      axial outlet direction of the axial air stream. </PAR><PAR>  In connection with the outlet direction and the acceleration of the axial      air in conduit 5' this guarantees an axial air flow which is stable,      uniform and of broad scope. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows an embodiment of the burner nozzle which differs from the      embodiment shown in FIGS. 2a and 2b 2, essentially by the presence of an      additional conduit 15', for powdered solid fuels, which is located between      the flame stabilizer 3 and the conduit 4' of eddying primary air. </PAR><PAR>  It is generally question of powdered coal which is transported in the      burner by a vector gas, for example air. Due to the abrasive properties of      such a solid fuel, the terminal zone of conduit 15' is only slightly      conical in order to allow passage of the fuel which is as easy as      possible. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows an embodiment comprising, in place of conduit 15' for a solid      fuel, another conduit 19' for a gaseous fuel, whose terminal section may      be conical, like conduit 4', and which may also comprise a device for      eddying the gas issuing from this conduit. In that case too, the terminal      section of conduit 19' is cylindrical in the zone of opening 19, in order      to avoid a divergence of the gaseous fuel which issues therefrom. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 shows an embodiment which comprises both a supply conduit 15' for      solid fuels and a conduit 19' for gaseous fuels. </PAR><PAR>  Conduits 4' and 5' for the principal proportion of primary air in the form      of eddying air and air having an axial direction are disposed outside      these two fuel conduits in radial direction. The inner edge of the opening      15, by which a considerable part of the primary combustion air may      penetrate in the burner in the form of vector gas for the solid fuel, is      located at a distance D' from the axis of the burner, which is more than      double the radius d of the opening 2 of the flame stabilizer, with the      result that, in all cases, the existence is guaranteed at the centre of      the flame of a sufficiently large dead zone which procures the      advantageous properties of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  Thanks to the invention, a burner and a process for exploiting a burner      equipping a rotary tube furnace have been created, which allow a reduced      proportion of primary air and a broader range of adjustment of the burner,      this leading to reduced energy consumption and a reduction of the      formation of nitrogen oxides detrimental to the environment. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
