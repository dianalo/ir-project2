Police used batons to disperse the crowd of 200 gathered in anarea of the city where disturbances are common after the annualApprentice Boys' Parade.   ``Officers were attacked by petrol bombs thrown by a riotous mobof 200,'' said a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, aBritish police force.   No injuries were reported, he said on condition of anonymity.   Twenty years ago, the Apprentice Boys' Parade caused riots inRoman Catholic districts of Londonderry and led to the dispatchingof British troops to Northern Ireland three days later on Aug. 14,1969.   Catholics plan their own march Monday to mark the anniversary,followed by a speech by Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, a prominentfigure in the republican movement in the 1960s.   On Saturday, four hours before thousands of Protestants marchedpeacefully along city streets banging drums, security forces founda bomb in a bar near a gate to the Catholic section of Londonderry,known as Bogside.   The bomb went off as it was being defused by British armyexperts. It shattered glass in the Apprentice Boys Memorial Hall,but no one was injured.   The Irish Republican Army later claimed responsibility and saidin a statement that the bomb was timed to go off while securityforces toured the area to demonstrate the IRA could strike in spiteof tight security.</TEXT></DOC>
