The book will focus on the negative effects of surrogatemotherhood on people, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Robert D.Arenstein, said Thursday.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's unsuccessful legal fight to keep the childshe agreed to bear for William and Elizabeth Stern under a $10,000contract sparked nationwide debate on surrogacy contracts.   The girl was known in court papers as Baby M.   The book was written with Pennsylvania investigative journalistLoretta Schwartz-Nobel and published by St. Martin's Press.   The 31-year-old Mrs. Whitehead-Gould lives in Bayport, N.Y., withher second husband and three of her children, Arenstein said.   ``She is pregnant and she is happy about it,'' the attorney added.   Stern, eventually granted custody of the girl by the New JerseySupreme Court, had tried to stop Mrs. Whitehead-Gould from writingthe book, arguing it would exploit the child, named Melissa.   But a Superior Court judge ruled that the book could focus onMrs. Whitehead-Gould's relationship with the child up until hersecond birthday.</TEXT><DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Actor Martin Sheen won a ruling from theNevada Supreme Court overturning a requirement that he post a $5,000bond aimed at stopping a protest trespass at a nuclear test site.   Sheen, active in the movement against nuclear testing, was forcedto post the ``peace bond'' after saying on national television hewould ``hopefully commit civil disobedience'' at the Nevada TestSite.   The Supreme Court, reversing a district judge's order, saidThursday that prosecutors had conceded that civil disobediencewasn't a crime in Nevada.   ``We conclude that (Sheen's) remarks did not indicate anintention to commit a criminal offense in this state,'' the courtadded in holding that the ``peace bond'' statute doesn't apply insuch cases.   Under Nevada law, the threat of a criminal act is enough torequire a ``peace bond.'' If a violation actually occurs, the bondcould be forfeited and the person could be jailed for up to sixmonths.</TEXT></DOC>
