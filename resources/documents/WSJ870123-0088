The complex, 147-page agreement was worked out by LTV and its 22-member bank group in December. At issue are controversial clauses in the agreement that affect the banks' collateral and restrict the profits LTV can funnel from its successful aerospace and defense unit to its troubled steel and energy units.    LTV, based in Dallas, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from its creditors in July 1986.    &quot;There's just been no need demonstrated for these funds,&quot; said Lawrence Galie, chairman of the committee representing LTV's unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. &quot;It benefits bank creditors at the expense of general creditors,&quot; he added.    LTV had urged swift approval of the agreement, saying it needs the new financing for letters of credit to support foreign sales of military and drilling equipment. It also said the agreement will save &quot;millions of dollars&quot; annually. But after two days of hearings, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland yesterday adjourned the matter until next month.    Under the agreement, the banks will provide $100 million in new financing and will repackage about $435 million of secured debt and letters of credit into a new revolving credit line. LTV would be required to pay current interest as it comes due on both the new line and the repackaged loan and in return has agreed to limit the amount of money transferred out of the aerospace and defense unit to $77 million in the first year plus 50% of the unit's profit in future years.    As part of the agreement, the banks aren't requiring new collateral for the additional $100 million in financing. But as part of the agreement on the repackaged loans, banks owed money by the LTV Steel Co. unit could also have a right to the assets of LTV Sales Finance Co. for collateral, and vice versa. The unsecured creditors are concerned that that aspect of the agreement would hurt creditors of the steel and finance units. &quot;It unnecessarily scrambles the eggs and undermines the independent character of the debtors,&quot; Mr. Galie said.    An attorney for the banks, Joel Zweibel, however, countered that because the new $100 million line would have a priority claim ahead of the repackaged debt, it &quot;decreases the cushion available to pay the old debt. We want to be sure that as a result of the new debt we're not jeopardizing the old.&quot;    Among other things, the unsecured creditors also are objecting to the limitations on the transfer of funds from the aerospace and defense unit, because the transfer alters one aspect of LTV's previously agreed-to cash management program and doesn't constitute a &quot;global rethinking&quot; of LTV's policies. Mr. Galie, the creditors group chairman, noted that the new agreement doesn't, for example, restrict the transfer of money from LTV Steel, which is said to have accumulated $500 million in cash since the bankruptcy filing.    The federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which has taken over four of LTV's troubled steel pension plans, said it objected to the financing agreement because it is a &quot;de facto plan of reorganization, which should not be approved outside the protections afforded by Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.&quot; The agency is also concerned that the revolving line of credit could be repaid outside of a formal bankruptcy reorganization plan. Mr. Zweibel, the banks' attorney, contended that &quot;nothing in the agreement dictates the terms of a reorganization plan.&quot; He said that the revolving line of credit would be repaid only as part of a court-approved reorganization plan. </TEXT></DOC>
