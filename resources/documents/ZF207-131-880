Federal Maritime CommissionInformation Storage and RetrievalCompetitionInformation ServicesTariffRequest for Proposals.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Information Industry Fights Competition From Govt.andM;It all came down to a single question: How is getting information over thetelephone any different from getting the same information in person at apublic reading room in Washington?andM;Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) officials, information industry executivesand members of the House of Representatives argued the issue at a recenthearing of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Subcommittee on MerchantMarine.andM;The FMC is planning to automate its tariff filing process, which is mostlypaper-intensive now and involves manually processing 700,000 pages of filingsa year.andM;As part of the Automated Tariff Filing and Information (ATFI) system, the FMChas proposed a remote retrieval feature that would allow users to dial-up thesystem and get tariff information for a marginal fee.andP;  Many industryobservers said the remote retrieval option would compete with servicesalready available by private sector vendors.andM;&quot;It would change the nature of the government's role in the distribution ofinformation,&quot; said Ken Allen, senior vice president of government relationsfor the Information Industries Association (IIA).andP;  IIA members believe theFMC's proposal could start an avalanche in government, where agencies wouldcompete openly with industry to provide information services, he said.andM;&quot;We cannot deal with this as an isolated case,&quot; Allen said.andP;  &quot;We must look atit as a long-term policy issue.&quot;andM;If the government increasinly provides information products that compete withindustry then &quot;you're going to discourage private sector investment,&quot; Allensaid.andM;Keeping the Work PrivateandM;The Office of Management and Budget as well as the House GovernmentOperations Committee are on IIA's side.andP;  &quot;An agency, for example, may havethe capability to ffer dial-up on-line access to its databases, but the samecapability may also be available from private firms that purchase theagency's databases,&quot; OMB note in a recent draft proposal on informationdissemination.andM;&quot;For the agency to offer the service will always entail some cost to thegovernment and the availability of virtually identical services from privatefirms is a compelling argument against the need for the government to offerthe service.&quot;andM;FMC officials considered these arguments against the remote retrievalfeature, but decided it was &quot;integral&quot; to the ATFI system, FMC chairwomanElaine L. Chao told the subcommittee.andM;Early this year, after five years of planning, the FMC released a final ATFIrequest for proposals that included a specification for a dial-up retrievalfeature.andP;  Bids are due in March and the FMC intends to make an award in July,Chao said.andP;  The agency requested $1.9 million for ATFI development costs forfiscal 1990.andM;&quot;The commission will not compete with third-party vendors,&quot; Chao said.andP;  &quot;Theservice we intend to offer is very rudimentary in nature.&quot;andM;Not all vendors are concerned.andP;  &quot;I believe other bidders will concur thatsophisticated tariff enhancement programs, which DXI and others will offer,are hardly threatend by the limited remote retrieval component of the FMC'sATFI proposal,&quot; said Robert M. Ryan, president of Data Exchange InternationalInc., a Pittsburgh-based company that provides information services to thetrade industry and intends to bid for the ATFI contract.andM;System Cued by TariffsandM;Now tariff rates appear on pages of information filed with FMC.andP;  Mostcompanies that supply automated versions of the tariff information use afull-text page format.andP;  The ATFI RFP calls for vendors to propose a databasesystem cued by tariffs, not by filing page formats.andM;Even so, exporters and others who use the tariff rates usually need moreinformation than a single tariff when working on a sale or planning ashipment, Ryan said.andP;  He said ATFI is a very small piece of the authomationpie existing in the maritime industry.andM;Without intervention, the ATFI procurement can move ahead.andP;  But IIA calledfor Congress to step in a settle the debate over information dissemination.andM;Members of the subcommittee seemed to lean toward the FMC.andP;  &quot;It seems to methe Maritime Commission is fulfilling the charge that the Congress put onthem in the Shipping Act of 1984&quot; to provide tariff information to thepublic, said Rep.andP;  Norman F. Lent (R-N.Y.).andP;  The vendors &quot;can still analyzethe information,&quot; he added.andP;  &quot;You can still put your own spin on theinformation and sell it.&quot;andM;And Rep.andP;  Herbert H. Bateman (R-Va.) concluded the information had notchanged so much and the agency was simply trying to supply it using the mostmodern technologies available.andM;&quot;Giving the shipping community computer access to the public information onfile with the FMC, via computer terminals at FMC's document room or remoteretrieval capability, does not expand on the agency's basicresponsibilities,&quot; said Rep.andP;  Helen D. Bentley (R-Md.).andM;&quot;The FMC is merely offering to extend its informational acess and not expandon existing available services,&quot; she said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
