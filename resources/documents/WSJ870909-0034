The proposal, envisioned as a pilot project, isn't seen as a major plank in the strategy the Bank Board is devising for dealing with insolvent thrifts. But it could solve a specific problem faced by troubled thrifts burdened by high interest costs. Some 460 of the nation's 3,200 federally insured thrifts are insolvent.    Currently, the Bank Board's Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. guarantees thrift institution deposits of as much as $100,000, but not the interest rate paid on them. As a result, depositors risk earning a lower rate if a thrift fails and its deposits are transferred to another institution.    Under the pilot project, the Bank Board would guarantee the interest rates paid on certain insured deposits at troubled thrifts. If the thrift holding such deposits were liquidated, the deposits would continue to earn the promised interest rate until maturity, even after being transferred to another institution.    Bank Board officials reason that with such guarantees, troubled thrifts wouldn't have to offer above-market rates to lure depositors. The ailing thrifts, by spending less of their scarce resources to attract deposits, could lower their operating costs, also easing the cost to federal insurers if they ultimately have to be liquidated.    Bank Board officials said that healthy thrifts also would benefit by not having to match the inflated rates offered by troubled savings and loan associations.    The Bank Board is seeking suggestions from the public and the financial industry until Sept. 21 on how a pilot project might be designed.    Currently, the Bank Board is considering a one-year experimental program involving a limited number of thrifts. It also is considering limiting its interest-rate guarantees, possibly by covering only large deposits placed by select brokers. Bank Board officials said they haven't yet drawn up a list of thrifts that might be included in the pilot project. </TEXT></DOC>
