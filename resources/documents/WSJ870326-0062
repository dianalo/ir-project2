New York-based Lear Siegler Holdings said the eight companies, which produce instruments, electronic systems and parts for weapons, airplanes and vehicles, are projected to have revenue totaling $700 million for the fiscal year ending June 30. In fiscal 1986, Lear Siegler had total revenue of $2.5 billion.    A company spokesman said the aerospace group is profitable, but he declined to elaborate on any talks that may be under way with potential buyers. The eight units employ 7,200 workers, or about 24% of the company's work force of 29,000.    Lear Siegler Holdings was created when Forstmann Little andamp; Co. completed a $2.1 billion leveraged buyout of Lear Siegler Inc., an aerospace and industrial company based in Santa Monica, Calif. Forstmann Little is an investment firm specializing in leveraged buyouts, transactions in which a group of investors borrows to finance the acquisition of a company. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    In February, the holding company said it planned to sell six other units and reported a loss of $65.6 million for its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31. The spokesman said that, thus far, none of those units have been sold.    Lear Siegler Holdings said it plans to retain one unit in its aerospace group, Management Services Corp., Oklahoma City, which maintains aircraft for various military agencies.    The holding company said the units being put up for sale include: Instrument andamp; Avionic Systems Corp., Grand Rapids, Mich.; Astronics Corp., Santa Monica, Calif.; International Corp., Stamford, Conn.; Developmental Sciences Corp., Ontario, Calif.; Power Equipment Corp., Cleveland; Romec Corp., Elyria, Ohio; Energy Products Corp., Santa Ana, Calif.; and Transport Dynamics Corp., Santa Ana, Calif.    Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. will act as financial adviser for Lear Siegler Holdings on the sales, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
