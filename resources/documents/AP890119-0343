The Atlanta Constitution reported that Louis O. Kelso, a SanFrancisco lawyer and a leading promoter of employee buyouts, saidthe group is almost ready to approach the board of directors ofTexas Air Corp., Eastern's parent.   The group organized last October as Grandview Acquisition Corp.,   Among the investors involved in Grandview is former CBS Inc.President John Backe, the Constitution said.   A spokeswoman for Kelso reached in New York said no one wasavailable to comment on the report Thursday.   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent declined to comment on the buyouteffort, except to emphasize that Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzohas repeatedly said Eastern is not for sale.   Eastern union officials also declined to discuss the buyouteffort.   ``It is very sensitive,'' said Charles E. Bryan, president of the8,500-member Eastern unit of the International Association ofMachinists and Aerospace Workers.   Kelso reportedly acknowledged that Grandview has yet to arrangeall of the financing needed to buy Miami-based Eastern, whichanalysts have speculated could go for between $600 million and $800million.   Kelso told the Constitution he does not expect financing to be aproblem, even though Eastern is nearly $2.5 billion in debt, islosing $1 million a day and has lost what were its two most valuableassets. Those assets included the System One computer reservationsystem, which is now a separate Texas Air subsidiary, and theWashington-New York-Boston shuttle, which is being sold to developerDonald J. Trump for $365 million.   ``I think that Eastern can be structured in a way that it couldbe a good opportunity,'' said Kelso, who developed many of thefinancing methods now used in employee stock ownership plans, knownas ESOPs.   The degree of employee ownership envisioned by Grandview and theconcessions that would be required of Eastern's workers has not beenfully determined, said Kelso and others familiar with the effort.   Eastern's unions have been seeking employee ownership of theairline for years. Kelso was involved in an unsuccessful ESOP effortin the months before Texas Air bought Eastern in late 1986.   Eastern's unions have made no secret of their desire to forceLorenzo to sell the airline.</TEXT></DOC>
