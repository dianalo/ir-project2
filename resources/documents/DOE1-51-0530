The paper gives a ranking of known fields according to per unitcosts. The ranking is based on individual anticipated cost and productionprofiles available from Wood and MacKenzie. Incomes and &quot;oil-rents&quot; byfield are also calculated under different assumptions of prices and costs.Finally, an attempt is made to estimate cost functions and productionprofiles, dependent on field specific key parameters as size of reservoir,water depth, number of wells, etc.</TEXT></DOC>
