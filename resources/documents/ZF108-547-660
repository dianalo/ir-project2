Snow is a whitecrow.&quot;andM;In unpopular scientific writings, such as papers from Utah on cold nuclearbombs or essays from San Diego on creationism, the overture &quot;There is someevidence that.andP;  .  .&quot; also carries a dash of &quot;Wouldn't it be wonderful if.andP;  .andO;.?&quot;.  The quantum mechanical variation is that there is evidence but the veryact of finding and revealing it would invoke instant vitiation.andP;  We are allagog at rumors that they've discovered a taped commentary recorded bySchrodinger's demon (or was it Maxwell's ass, or Buridan's cat?).andP;  Thequestion is, Which of the three options will be taken?andM;(1) listen to the tape;andM;(2) let the tape play in an empty, sealed, soundproofed room;andM;(3) erase the tape unheard.andM;Apparently, there are waves-cumparticles out there with severe identitycrises, anxiously awaiting this decision.andM;Let me quickly unconfuse you on l'Affaire Schrodinger.andP;  There is ampleevidence ([1] Bohm.andP;  D.: collect telephone call to the author, 1976) thatSchrodinger really did put a small cat in a sealed compartment.andP;  Thecompartment was divided down the middle by a screen containing a tiny hingedcat-flap (see Figure 23.4.vi).andP;  Each half of the compartment had a bale ofFarmer Brown's hay floating around (the so-called Brownian motion).andP;  Thebales were of equal mass and remained equidistant from the flap.andP;  The catoperated the flap, hoping to entice the left bale into the right compartmentor vice versa.andP;  The cat died.andP;  Why?andP;  Candidates should select from thefollowing:andM;(1) the flap was smaller than the bales;andM;(2) the entropy of a closed cat is monotonic increasing after death;andM;(3) cats don't eat hay;andM;(4) if one bale reached the flap, so would the other bale;andM;(5) lack of oxygen.andM;Do the animal libbers out there know about these experiments, by the way?andO;Gedanken oder nicht gedanken, it's still very painful.andM;P andamp;andamp; !PandM;While near the subject of self-antonyms, there is some evidence that readershave been responding to my call.andP;  Bruce N. Baker of SRI International(pronounced Ess-Ar-Eye--the &quot;Stanford&quot; is silent) sends me:andM;scan--to examine closely scan--to look over hastilyandM;anon--at once, immediately anon--later, at another timeandM;Bruce was unsure of the proper salutation when addressing this columnist,offering the string, &quot;Mr? Dr? Prof? Guru?&quot;.andP;  For future reference, pleasenote that &quot;Your Serene Meathead&quot; is the only form sanctioned by Debrett.andP;  Myown search for self-antonyms has uncovered:andM;cut--(Amer.) to prepare and sign (a check) cut--to reduce or withhold (salaryor wages)andM;regular--normal, reasonable, straightforward regular--(of a UNIX expression)cryptic, convoluted, unobviousandM;bait--v.t.andP;  to entice, to attract by subterfuge bait--v.t.andP;  to torment (abear) by jeering and proddingandM;There's also &quot;operating&quot; as in the ancient oxymoron:andM;OS: (1) rag trade abbrev.andP;  for Outsize (large garment).andP;  (2) OperatingSystem: that which prevents system from operating.andM;Readers, have we any more out there?andM;GOTO main()andM;Returning to my opening thesis, I remarked that &quot;Intelligent&quot; wasdisappearing from product names.andP;  However.andP;  .  .(Churchillian pause).andP;  .  .myjoy is somewhat alloyed (the rare, for some reason, antonym of unalloyed) byan emerging trend in the computer-vendor onomasticon.andP;  I refer to theinvasion of Knowledge-Based goods and services of all kinds, adverts forwhich apply generous baitings of &quot;Expert&quot; as both noun, adjective, and partsof speech yet to be parsed satisfactorily.andM;Is there no rest for the crusader?andP;  For perestroikered anti-Soviet TV andradio envangelists, perhaps there is a short, puzzled respite, but now eventhey have bounced back with &quot;Bibles for Russia&quot; as their new, lucrativefundraising slogan.andP;  In the endless struggle for preciser English, it seems,redeyed, doryphoric vigilance is the dull cry.andM;&quot;Knowledge-Based&quot; has become persistent enough to gain a place in theacronymic zoo: KBMT, for example, is Knowledge-Based Machine Translation, adiscipline prominently featured in the current ALLC Journal.andP;  Plain old MT,as you may know, has been in the doldrums since the expensive failures of the1970s.andP;  You still hear the jokes from that era: folksinger Leadbelly becameTin Stomach in an English-Russian MT program; &quot;second to none&quot; came out as&quot;next to nothing&quot;; &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot; translated to &quot;invisibleidiot&quot;, and so on.andP;  In Vol.andP;  15 No.andP;  1 of my favorite ACM publication,Software Engineering Notes, Editor Peter Neumann reports some new MT snafusin the EEC French-English SYSTRAN service: &quot;Les agriculteurs vis a vis de lapolitique agricole commune.andP;  .  .&quot; became &quot;farmers live to screw the commonagricultural policy&quot;--a remarkable case of In MT veritas.andP;  Peter cites thehilarious case of &quot;nous avions&quot; going to &quot;us airplanes&quot;.andP;  I have a sneakingfeeling that I heard that one in the 1970s.andM;Somewhere along the way, apparently, the idea emerged that MT programs justdidn't know enough about the quirks of natural (some prefer &quot;ordinary&quot;)language, whence the rush to catenate KB and MT.andP;  I have my doubts but remaincalmly agnostic.andM;Certainly, we often criticize machines unfairly for failing to disambiguateinput that many humans would struggle with.andP;  However, the major problems ofidioms, ironies, and other NL idiosyncrasies seem insuperable even with thelargest KBMT databases.andP;  Irony, by the way, is best explained by the responseof a Liverpool father faced with the news that his unmarried daughter ispregnant.andP;  He says, &quot;Marvellous!andP;  Bloody marvellous!&quot;andP;  You need an immenseamount of K in your KBMT to decide when P means !P.andM;Expert Wanted--NoandM;Experience NecessaryandM;It is hard to resist a package claiming to have &quot;expertise&quot;, especially if itis &quot;knowledge-based expertise&quot;.andP;  The implication is that rival products offersomething a tad antithetical: intuitive or ignorance-based expertise orknowledge-based incompetence.andP;  &quot;This we should pay for?andP;  No, this we havewithout leaving home, already!&quot; ([97] spinoza, B.: private note to author,1674).andP;  We seek unambiguous, practical advice from &quot;those who know fromexperience&quot;.andP;  But do we know enough to distinguish expert from charlatan?andP;  Weneed a meta-expert, perhaps, to guide us here.andP;  During the call-in radiotalk-show, the advisor tells the caller &quot;to find a good realtor you cantrust&quot;.andP;  &quot;How do i do that?&quot;andP;  &quot;Ask around, ask your attorney.&quot;andP;  &quot;I don't knowany attorneys.&quot;andP;  &quot;You'll need to find a good attorney you can trust.&quot;andM;And when the experts disagree, as oft they do, what then?andP;  Put all thesurviving Nobel laureates in Economics in a room.andP;  It's mildly disconcertingthat they differ fiercely on major aspects of fiscal policy.andP;  The big shockis that they come to blows over the question &quot;What is money?&quot;andM;A wonderfully down-to-earth flier from Mike Siewruk, VP of PerformanceComputer Diagnostics, pushing his do-it-yourself Checklt PC Diagnosticsoftware, is worth ten books of Heideggerian epistemology.andP;  Mike writes thatmost of us live in fear of being conned by computer-service technicians.andM;WHY?andP;  Because you're uninformed, my friend.andP;  No offense, but let's face it.andO;When you know what the real facts are, you're not in fear.andP;  Knowledge iscertainty.andP;  It's confidence.andP;  It's what you really need to prevent anyonefrom taking advantage of you.andP;  And computers are no different than cars,insurance, or you name it.andP;  When you really know something, no one is goingto give you a bath.andM;Each bold sentence warrants an essay, but I limit myself to two observations.andO;I usually cringe (but only briefly) at the &quot;you name it&quot; terminator, now acommon alternative to the equally lazy &quot;etc.&quot;andP;  In the above context, though,&quot;or you name it&quot; coming after computers, cars, and insurance, has anattractive, no-nonsense cadence that works.andP;  British con-artists &quot;take you tothe cleaners&quot;, presumably removing your clothes and possessions in theprocess.andP;  I take it that &quot;give you a bath&quot; is the American version of thisidiom.andP;  David W. Maurer's Language of the Underworld (LExington, KY: Univ.andO;Press of Kentucky, 1981) gives many idioms involing the &quot;cleaning&quot; of victimsby a fine gallery of confidence tricksters (there's even a chapter called&quot;The Argot of the Three-Shell Game&quot;), but none has an explicit reference tobaths or bathing.andM;Blowing HotandM;Temperature is the fashionable criterion of fashionability.andP;  John C. Dvorakdescribes a mundane program as &quot;hotter than hot&quot;.andP;  We buy hot chips and hotprinters, then expensively contrive to keep them cool.andP;  An advert from SnowSoftware of Clearwater, FL, claims that:andM;All language [sic] Snow Report[R] Writer is the hottest thing sinceArtificial Intelligence!andM;It's a 1990 advert that sounds as though it was written in 1956.andM;Seduced Instruction SetandM;UCLA Extension offers a three-day course by William Horton (author of theprize-winning paper, &quot;Toward the Four-Dimensional Page&quot;) called &quot;DesigningObvious Systems&quot;.andP;  Among the touted topics are the usual question-beggars:&quot;Design Legible and Attractive Displays&quot;, &quot;Incorporate Appropriate Job Aids&quot;,and &quot;Select Input and Output Devices to Match the Task&quot;.andP;  So that's why theyare called &quot;Obvious Systems&quot;?andP;  More riveting was the section called &quot;SeduceReluctant or Anxious Users&quot;.andP;  I wonder what the $595 fee covers here.andP;  Do youhave to bring your own champagne, light dimmer, candelabra, hi-fi, and stampcollection?andP;  This list probably reveals my advancing years more than myunwitting use of words such as &quot;wireless&quot;, &quot;core&quot;, and &quot;gramophone neeldes&quot;.andM;Stan Kelly-Bootle has been computing, on and off, for over 35 years since hisdays at Cambridge University, where he earned the world's first postgraduatediploma in computer science.andP;  Among his many pursuits, he has authored TheDevil's DP Dictionary, the MC68000 Primer, Mastering Turbo C, and MasteringQuickC.andP;  with the publication of Mastering C++, Kelly-Bootle will havewritten nine books.andP;  His Porsche sports California license numberMC68000--which he calls the final, shameful step in his Marin Countyyuppification.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
