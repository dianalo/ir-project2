<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-74-0698 </DOCNO><TEXT>The source rock potential of Mesozoic sediments (cuttings) from the Hyllebjerg1 well, Danish Subbasin, has been assessed using a number of differentpetrographical and organochemical methods. Sediments with the most promisingsource rock characteristics for liquid hydrocarbons were detected mainlyin the lower Jurrassic sequences of the upper Fjerritslev Formation (F-4and upper F-3 Member) and in one horizon in the Upper Cretaceous VedstedFormation. But these sediments may be excluded as actual source rocksin this well as maturity is first reached at the top of the Gassum Formation(Upper Triassic/Lower Jurassic). The conditions may only be sligthlydifferent off - structure in this area, as the F-4 and F-3 Member sequenceaccording to seismic sections is found at approximately the same depth.But the depth to (and the thickness of) the Fjerritslev Formation isincreasing towards the SE into the rimsynclines of the saltdomes nearby.While sufficient maturity is reached in the deeper part of the well,no commercial accumulations of hydrocarbons were encountered. However,generation and migration of small amounts of gaseous hydrocarbons fromGassum Formation sediments containing more humic-influenced organic matterwith only minor reworking cannot generally be excluded either here orelsewhere in the basin. More attention should also be paid to the VindingFormation sediments which contain some algae-rich (Botryocous-type) oil-pronehorizons of more favourable source rock conditions. Mature sedimentsare found at shallower depths (8500') in this well in the central partof the basin compared to the more marginal areas (8900') where a slightlyhigher geothermal gradient in Hyllebjerg 1 (28 deg. C/km uncorrected)is seen compared with the marginal areas (23.5 deg. C/km uncorrected)away from the basinal depocenter. The basinal depocenter also has a higherheat flow. (AB) 69 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
