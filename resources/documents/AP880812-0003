(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thanks to the meddling of a group ofsharp-eyed Montana fifth graders, Oregon's ``D River'' has lost its30-year title as the world's shortest river, but not without afight from miffed local officials.   Editors of the Guinness Book of World Records agreed to give thetitle to the Roe River in Great Falls, Mont., after students therespent the past school year researching the river, which flowsthrough a state park.   The students concluded the Roe is 201 feet, far shorter than the440-foot D River near Lincoln City, and submitted their evidence tothe Guinness editors.   ``On the basis of that, the Roe River was shorter,'' assistanteditor Cyd Smith said from the publisher's New York office.   News of the change was not well-received in Lincoln City,however, where the D River has held the title of shortest namedriver for 30 years.   ``Where a river begins and ends may be in the eye of thebeholder,'' Mayor Dell Isham said Wednesday.   In fact, Lincoln City now insists the D is only 120 feet long,give or take 5 feet. City officials are preparing documentation toconvince Guinness editors that they were right the first time andthat the D River should regain its rightful title in the book's1990 edition. The deadline is past for next year's edition.   Of course, the question being asked in Great Falls is: How can ariver shrink from 440 feet to 120 feet? At first it was funny, butfewer people are laughing now that it's clear Lincoln City isserious.   ``It's fun to a point, but it has no end when people can comeback and keep shortening it until it's kind of ridiculous,'' saidSusie Nardinger, the Great Falls teacher who led her class in theriver study.   The Roe River's acceptance into the records book is a matter ofpride to the community's 60,000 residents, she said.   ``Our students went about it perfectly innocently,'' she said.``The victory has been marred because Oregon came out with itsclaims and, in a sense, stole the limelight at the peak of theirsuccess.''   Signs soon will grace the banks of the Roe to proclaim itsworld-class status. About 625 miles away in Lincoln City, similarsigns remain along the D River and there are no plans to removethem.   Isham says the dispute is simply a matter of setting the recordstraight. Lincoln City insists previous estimates of the river'slength inaccurately measured from a point in the river thatactually is part of Devil's Lake.   That point looked like part of the river because a landfill hadclosed in the banks of the lake, Isham said.   A spokesman for Gov. Neil Goldschmidt says the states' governorscould get out their yardsticks and settle the issue once and forall.   ``If it's a good, honest fight, we'll be there,'' Gregg Kantorsaid. ``But it'll always be the shortest river in our hearts.''</TEXT></DOC>
