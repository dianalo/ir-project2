HAMM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A second effort to impose a youth curfew aspart of an effort to curb the drug trade in the District ofColumbia again failed to pass constitutional muster in a federalcourt.   Hours before it was to take effect late Monday, U.S. DistrictJudge Charles H. Richey blocked enforcement of the curfew for atleast 10 days pending a further hearing.   ``There are serious First, Fourth and Fifth amendment concernsraised in this issue,'' Richey said, mentioning the constitutionalsafeguards of the right of assembly, reasonable search and seizuresand due process.   The bill, which would have required people under age 18 to beoff the city's streets, sidewalks and other public spaces by 11p.m. Sunday through Thursday and midnight Friday and Saturday, withsome exceptions, was to have taken effect for 90 days at 11 p.m.Monday.   The D.C. Council had approved the curfew April 4, amending abroader bill struck down by Richey on March 20.   Arthur B. Spitzer, legal director for the American CivilLiberties Union, argued that no curfew could prevent youths frombecoming involved with drugs and crime.   ``It's absurd to think a youngster who's out dealing drugs andcarrying a gun is going to go home and go to bed when the clockstrikes 11,'' said Spitzer, who represents 15 plaintiffs.   Spitzer said the curfew bill discriminates against poorerjuveniles and defines the word ``parent'' too strictly, ruling outother adult relatives or friends. Spitzer pointed out thatemployers, not employees, are required by law to possess youths'work permits.   Assistant corporation counsel Victor Long told Richey the D.C.Council adopted the ``least restrictive measure'' it could totackle juvenile crime. The law would not infringe on constitutionalrights, he said, but rather would place ``reasonable restraints''for ``a valid reason,'' he said.   Under the law, police would take violators to the nearest policestation and call their parents. The first violation would notresult in a fine, but parents would be fined $100 for the secondcurfew violation and $300 for all subsequent violations.   The exceptions in the amended bill include minors accompanied bya parent; returning home from an activity sponsored by a church,school or non-profit organization; traveling in a motor vehicle;employed during curfew hours; or on an emergency errand.   Only one federal court has upheld a curfew bill, in Middletown,Pa., in 1975, according to Spitzer. Since then, federal courts havestruck down curfew laws three times.</TEXT></DOC>
