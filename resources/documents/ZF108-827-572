(Sharedcommon RAM network) (SCRAMNet)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Williams, Tom.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Systran is addressing the needs of distributed multi-processor,real-time systems by developing the Shared Common RAM Network(SCRAMNet), a shared memory network technology based onfiber-optic waveguide media that combines the best aspects ofshared memory architectures and message-passing networks.andO;SCRAMNet's ring topology eliminates contention uncertainties, andthe expensive software protocol overhead associated with mostnetworks is not a factor.andP;  Its 150M-bps data rats is 50 percentfaster than Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).andP;  Up to 256computers can be connected via of the fiber link; an interfaceboard contains the network interface electronics and 8kbytes to2Mbytes of shared memory at each node.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Systran Translation Systems Inc.
