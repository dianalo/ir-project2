Boesky has given investigators a &quot;window on the rampant criminal conduct&quot; that has &quot;permeated the securities industry,&quot; the government said in a pre-sentencing memorandum describing Mr. Boesky's cooperation.    The government said &quot;dozens&quot; of individuals are currently under investigation as a result of Mr. Boesky's disclosures. The comments are the government's most explicit so far about the progress of its massive investigation of wrongdoing on Wall Street and the value of Mr. Boesky's cooperation.    Mr. Boesky &quot;revealed that criminal conduct is at the heart of a substantial amount of market activity by established securities industry professionals,&quot; the government said.    Mr. Boesky, who pleaded guilty to one felony for his role in Wall Street's insider trading scandal, is scheduled to be sentenced this Friday. He faces a maximum prison term of five years and a maximum fine of $250,000.    According to the government, the crimes disclosed by Mr. Boesky, in addition to insider trading, include manipulation of stock prices, unlawful takeover activity, undercapitalization of broker-dealers, the filing of false books and records, failure to disclose participation in a group controlling more than 5% of the stock in a company, and so-called parking of stock as an accommodation to others. As for parking, the government said it is an illegal practice that appears to be &quot;deeply rooted in the brokerage industry.&quot; Parking occurs when one investor buys a stock for another investor who doesn't want to be identified as the owner.    The government's memorandum released by the court was heavily censored so as not to disclose the names of any people implicated by Mr. Boesky that haven't already been identified by the government.    Among those known to be under investigation as a result of Mr. Boesky's disclosures are Michael Milken, head of the &quot;junk&quot; bond operations of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.; New York investor Carl Icahn; and John Mulheren, an arbitrager and head of Jamie Securities Inc. None has been charged with any wrongdoing and all three have asserted their innocence.    Mr. Boesky's cooperation has led to guilty pleas by Martin A. Siegel, the former Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. takeover specialist, and Boyd L. Jefferies, former chairman of Jefferies andamp; Co. His cooperation also has led to numerous criminal charges against individuals involved in the Guinness PLC takeover scandal in Britain.    The government emphasized that it knew only about an insider trading scheme involving Mr. Boesky and former investment banker Dennis B. Levine when Mr. Boesky surrendered a year ago and agreed to cooperate. The government said that Mr. Boesky's cooperation has been &quot;unprecedented&quot; and that not since the passage of the securities laws in the 1930s has the government &quot;learned so much at one time about securities law violations.&quot;    In its memo, the government didn't recommend any sentence, but asked U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker, who is scheduled to sentence Mr. Boesky on Friday, to weigh Mr. Boesky's &quot;serious and widespread criminal conduct&quot; against his &quot;outstanding cooperation.&quot;    The government memo was released by Judge Lasker in response to motions filed by Newsday, a Long Island, N.Y., newspaper, and American Lawyer magazine. In a letter to the judge opposing American Lawyer's motion for release of the entire memo, the government wrote that releasing censored portions of the memo would provide &quot;Drexel Burnham with premature access to closely held details of the ongoing criminal investigation,&quot; apparently confirming that Drexel is under investigation. John Carroll, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the matter, said that &quot;the letter speaks for itself.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
