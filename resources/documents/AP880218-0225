The 26-year-old victim, whose identity was not released,suffered from AIDS-related pneumonia, said Howard Rubenstein, aspokesman for Downtown Beekman Hospital.   The fire remained confined to the respirator but forced theevacuation of 26 patients in the intensive care unit and patientsfrom elsewhere in the hospital, Rubenstein said. No other injurieswere reported.   A short-circuit in the respirator may have ignited the oxygen,fire officials said.   ``Nothing else around (the respirator) burned,'' said FireDepartment spokesman Lt. Frank Martinez. ``The bed ... was notburned in any way. We really have no idea of what killed thepatient actually.''   Thick black smoke enveloped the third-floor intensive care unitand extended down to the first floor, Rubenstein said.</TEXT></DOC>
