Toussie L.P., a New York-based investment partnership with a 9.9% stake in Lionel Corp., said it would consider extending its offer to acquire the rest of the specialty toy retailer.    The partnership had set a Sept. 18 deadline for the company to consider the $8.25-a-share, or about $100 million, offer for the remaining stock.    In a letter contained in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Toussie chastised Lionel for letting the offer expire without first convening a board meeting to consider it.    According to the SEC filing, Lionel informed the partnership that the regularly scheduled September board meeting fell after the deadline for the proposal expired. If the offer was still valid at that time, it would be added to the regular agenda, it said.    Mr. Toussie said the partnership is considering adding to its stake and would &quot;keep all of our options open&quot; regarding the possibility of either filing a lawsuit or making a hostile offer if the board refuses to meet with it. A Lionel spokeswoman said the company hadn't seen the SEC filing and wouldn't comment. </TEXT></DOC>
