Last November, the FTC, by a 4-1 vote, extended until 2006 a ban on Union Carbide entering into long-term contracts to sell industrial gas to distributors, or requiring distributors to purchase exclusively from the company at certain locations.    The ban had been imposed in 1977. Late last year the FTC extended the ban, asserting that senior company officials had methodically violated the prohibition.    Union Carbide, in related suits filed in federal district court in Bridgeport, Conn., and in the federal appeals court in New York City, challenged the FTC's legal right to extend the ban. The company also said the agency had acted &quot;arbitrarily and capriciously.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
