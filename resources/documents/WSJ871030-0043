Concern about the dollar had knocked down stock prices in Tokyo in trading Thursday, and had helped check gains in London.    The Nikkei average of 225 selected stocks surged 662.60 points to close the Friday morning session at 22,696.49. Markets in London, too, could get a boost from the dollar's recovery Thursday of nearly all its losses in New York trading and from the rise in U.S. stock prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 91.51 points to 1938.33, a gain of nearly 5%.    Also, London could be buoyed by the British government's decision to proceed with a huge offering of British Petroleum Co. stock as well as its decision to give underwriters some protection from potential losses. Uncertainty about the sale had weighed on the market, analysts said.    Tokyo share prices closed down more than 540 points Thursday on selling in export-led shares as the dollar traded below the 140 yen level in currency dealings.    The Nikkei index, which fell 257.43 points Wednesday, fell 543.64 points Thursday to 22033.89.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index fell 38.61 points, or 2.1%, to 1802.77. Turnover in the first section index came to an estimated 700 million shares, down from 850 million shares Wednesday and a billion shares Tuesday.    Losers outnumbered gainers, 867 to 83.    Traders said bearish interpretations of the willingness of central banks to support the dollar as it slumped below the important 140 yen level in Thursday currency dealings undercut share prices of exportled blue chips. That erased a promising turnaround in the morning session, when buying in heavy industrial and steel shares led by large Japanese securities companies began to soften a roughly 400-point drop on the index. Morning strength in power utility, gas and rail shares dissipated by the afternoon.    One trader for a major foreign securities house said selling in exporters reflected feelings there were &quot;no convincing moves to support the dollar,&quot; despite reports of intervention by the Federal Reserve in Wednesday New York dealings. He argued the U.S. central bank is &quot;experimenting to see if the dollar can go lower,&quot; partly in an effort to get Japan and West Germany to lower their interest rates and stimulate their economies.    Some steel issues managed to close higher, but pharmaceutical, financial, retail, real estate and other sectors fell.    In blue-chip electrical and computer makers, Kyocera fell 400 yen to 4,200 ($30.50). Matsushita Electric Industry dropped 80 to 1,830.    Brokerages were sold in the financial sector. Nomura fell 20 points to 3,440 on worries of reduced business volume in the bearish market. Yamaichi was down 90 points to 1,650. Daiei fell 70 points to 1,350 in the retail sector. In banking shares, Bank of Tokyo fell 70 points to 1,280.    In Hong Kong, share prices closed sharply lower, pushed by selling by foreign institutional investors and local unit trust managers in moderate trading. Shares fell across the board. Utility shares were hurt the least; buyers again looked for bluechip issues as smaller, more speculative stocks languished. Brokers said overseas institutions continued to dump shares. The Hang Seng index closed at 2204.52, down 165.64.    Share prices closed firmer Thursday in London, but below the day's peak as participants waited for the government's decision on whether the British Petroleum share offering will go ahead.    The Financial Times 30-share index closed 14.9 points ahead at 1303.4. Volume was 481.5 million shares, well down from 698.4 million shares a day earlier. The 100-share index was up 23.6 points at 1682.0.    Dealers said the market was buoyed by Thursday's early rise on Wall Street and speculation that British interest rates will fall further. Analysts said the government might sanction another cut in interest rates as part of an international effort to avoid a recession after recent stock market crashes.    But share prices were held back from a major rally by uncertainty surrounding the huge BP share issue and by worry about the recent slide in the dollar, they added.    &quot;If we could get the BP offering out of the way the market would really take off,&quot; one dealer said.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed mostly lower in active trading on an avalanche of sell orders by small domestic investors, brokers said.    Private clients, who had bought heavily into the market last week and this Tuesday to take advantage of rock-bottom prices, seemed to have lost their nerves and attempted to cut their losses at any price, brokers said. The official fixing of stock prices had to be delayed half an hour because of the flood of sell orders.    The continuous fall of the dollar, which touched another seven-year low of 1.7360 marks at the Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing, also induced institutional investors to reduce their holdings, and kept buying interest at a bare minimum.    But the market recouped some of its losses later in the session, and a few heavily traded blue-chip stocks ended with narrow gains.    The market seems to have finally found support at its present level, one broker said. Participants said they are encouraged to see that selling was spearheaded by small players, not institutions, a trend that usually signals the end to a market slump.    Automobile, chemical and electrical shares were again the main losers in the market. Daimler-Benz tumbled 37 marks to 758 marks ($436.50), and Volkswagen dropped 27.5 to 260.5. But Bayerische Motorenwerke, which was hardest hit early this week, edged up 5 to 495.    Among chemical shares, BASF tumbled 11.5 marks to 259., Bayer fell 8.5 to 272., and Hoechst eased 7 to 249. But Schering, which lost 12.4% Wednesday, inched up 2 to 447.    In other European markets, stocks fell in Brussels, Stockholm and Milan and were mixed in Paris, Zurich and Amsterdam.    Elsewhere, Australian share prices resumed their slide, with the main market indicator down 7.5% and at its lowest level since early October last year.    The index lost all its Wednesday gains and finished near the day's low, with little sign of any rally ahead.    The U.S. dollar's retreat and subsequent sharp fall in the Australian dollar sent new shudders through the stock market as Australian interest rates climbed. The renewed slide in Tokyo stocks further depressed sentiment.    Shares were also down in Singapore in heavy selling.    Prices on the Toronto Stock Exchange were mixed. The exchange's composite index of 300 stocks rose 1.22%, but declines outnumbered advancing shares, 603 to 404. Volume declined to 31.2 million shares from Wednesday's 34.5 million.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                     % This                                 Oct 27    Oct 26     Year U.S. ........................... 218.9     213.3    -  4.0 Britain ........................ 510.6     506.0    +  2.6 Canada ......................... 320.8     316.3    -  3.7 Japan ......................... 1096.3    1068.8    + 16.0 France ......................... 323.2     319.1    - 20.8 Germany ........................ 193.5     192.2    - 25.5 Hong Kong ..................... 1706.8    1625.6    -  4.1 Switzerland .................... 164.9     158.3    - 17.9 Australia ...................... 249.2     261.7    -  5.6 World index .................... 384.2     377.1    +  7.7</TEXT></DOC>
