This documentalso contains proposed amendments to the Pension Excise Tax Regulations(26 CFR Part 54) under section 4979. These amendments are proposed to conformthe regulations to sections 1105, 1116 and 1117 of the Tax Reform Act of1986 (TRA '86). <ITAG tagnum="84">Changes to 401(k) Arrangements</ITAG>Section 1116 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 made several changes affectingcash or deferred arrangements. Those changes relating to computation ofthe actual deferral percentage (ADP), allowing rural electric cooperativesto maintain qualified cash or deferred arrangements, new standards fortesting discrimination in coverage, and new definitions of compensationand highly compensated employee were contained in final regulations publishedunder section 401(k) on August 8, 1988. Additional changes affecting cashor deferred arrangements are included in this notice of proposed rulemaking.Section 401(k)(2)(B) permits distributions from cash or deferred arrangementsupon termination of a plan without establishment of a successor plan, thesale by a corporation of substantially all of its assets used in its tradeor business to another corporation, or the sale by a corporation of suchcorporation's interest in a subsidiary to an unrelated entity. The proposedregulations provide that a sale of 85 percent of the relevant assets willbe deemed a sale of substantially all assets.Prop. Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.401(k)-1(e)(4) reflects new limits imposedby section 1116(f) of TRA '86 on the ability of state or local governmentsand tax exempt organizations to establish cash or deferred arrangementsafter certain dates. A state or local government may not establish a cashor deferred arrangement after May 5, 1986. An organization exempt fromtax under Subtitle A of Code, including federal instrumentalities describedin section 501(c)(1) of the Code, may not establish a cash or deferredarrangement after July 1, 1986. The proposed regulations contain specialrules allowing all employees of an employer to participate in a plan establishedby the employer before the applicable effective dates. Comments are specificallyrequested on the definition of the appropriate employer.Plans established by state and local governments and tax-exempt organizationsbefore the applicable effective dates are, of course, subject to all requirementsapplicable to other plans that include cash or deferred arrangements. However,special effective dates are provided for plans of state and local governmentsto comply with the new discrimination tests of section 401(k)(3).Prop. Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.401(k)-1(e)(5) reflects the amendment ofsection 401(k)(2) to require a plan to permit an otherwise eligible employeeto participate in a cash or deferred arrangement after the employee hascompleted one year of service.Section 401(k)(4) provides that a cash or deferred arrangement does notmeet the requirements of section 401(k) if any other benefit (other thana matching contribution described in section 401(m)) is contingent uponthe employee's electing to have the employer make or not make contributionsunder the cash or deferred arrangement in lieu of receiving cash. The proposedregulations clarify that other employer benefits include, but are not limitedto, health benefits, vacations or vacation pay, life insurance, dentalplans. legal services plans, increases in salary, bonuses, loans, financialplanning services, subsidized retirement benefits, stock options and propertysubject to section 83. Also, nonqualified deferred compensation is an employerbenefit only to the extent that an employee may receive additional nonqualifieddeferred compensation to the extent the employee does not make electivecontributions.Section 401(k)(8) permits the distribution or recharacterization of excesscontributions which would otherwise cause an employer's plan not to meetthe ADP requirements of section 401(k)(3)(A). The proposed regulationsprovide that, for nondiscrimination purposes, recharacterized amounts aretreated as employee contributions for the year in which the elective contributionswould have been received (but for the deferral election) and must, therefore,be tested under section 401(m) for that year. The proposed regulationsalso provide that, whether distributed or recharacterized, excess contributionsare annual additions in the year of deferral. Additional rules concerningrecharacterization were contained in final regulations under section 401(k)published in August 8, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Nondiscrimination Requirements for Employee and Matching Contributions</ITAG>Section 401(m), added by section 1117 of TRA '86, contains new nondiscriminationrules for employee and matching contributions. These new nondiscriminationrules, which supplement the ADP tests applicable to cash or deferred arrangements,apply to plans described in section 401(a), annuity plans described insection 403(a), and annuity contracts described in section 403(b).The proposed regulations define the term ``employee contribution'' to includeboth voluntary and mandatory contributions that are credited to a separateaccount to which gains or losses are allocated. The term also includesrecharacterized elective contributions. The term also includes employeecontributions to the defined contribution portion of a plan described insection 414(k), employee contributions to a qualified cost-of-living arrangementdescribed in section 415(k)(2)(B), employee contributions applied to thepurchase of whole life insurance or survivor benefit protection under adefined contribution plan and employee contributions to a contract describedin section 403(b). The term ``employee contribution'' does not includerepayment of loans or buy-backs of benefits described in section 411(a)(7)(C).The proposed regulations do not allow either elective contributions ormatching contributions to be used to satisfy the minimum contribution orbenefit which must be made to top-heavy plans on behalf of non-key employees.This is because a non-key employee must receive the top-heavy minimum contributionor benefit regardless of whether he makes an elective contribution or hasa matching contribution made on his behalf. This rule applies to plan yearsbeginning after December 31, 1988. Qualified nonelective contributions,however, can be used to satisfy the minimum required contribution in atop-heavy plan.The proposed regulations require that employee contributions and matchingcontributions meet both the special nondiscrimination test of section 401(m)(2)(A)with respect to the amount of contributions and the nondiscrimination testof section 401(a)(4) with respect to other benefits, rights, and features,including the availability of contributions. The special nondiscriminationtest requires that the actual contribution percentage for eligible highlycompensated employees not exceed the greater of (1) 125 percent of theactual contribution percentage for all other eligible employees, or (2)the lesser of 200 percent of the actual contribution percentage for allother eligible employees, or the actual contribution percentage for allother eligible employees plus two percentage points.An employee contribution is taken into account under the special nondiscriminationtest of section 401(m)(2)(A) for the plan year in which such amounts arecontributed to the trust. Payment by the employee to an agent of the planis treated as a contribution to the trust at the time of payment to theagent if the funds so paid are transmitted to the trust within a reasonableperiod after payment to the agent.Section 401(m)(6) permits correction of excess aggregate contribution amountscontributed to a plan subject to the requirements of section 401(m). Suchcorrection must be made through a plan distribution; recharacterizationis not available as a method of correction. In addition, excess aggregatecontributions may be avoided through making additional qualified nonelectiveor matching contributions. The proposed regulations also provide rulesfor coordinating the correction of elective deferrals, excess contributions,and excess aggregate contributions.For plan years to which section 401(m) applies, the rules of Rev. Rul.80-307, 1980-2 C.B. 136, and Rev., Rul. 80-350, 1980-2 C.B. 133, whichset forth rules governing employee contributions, will no longer apply.Thus, for example, whether mandatory employee contributions and matchingcontributions are discriminatory will be determined without regard to the``six percent of compensation'' rule, and voluntary employee contributionswill not be limited to ten percent of compensation.Section 401(m)(9) gives the Secretary of the Treasury the authority toprescribe rules limiting the use of the alternative limitation test (200percent/2 percentage points) of sections 401(k)(3)(A)(ii)(II) and 401(m)(2)(A)(ii).In general, the proposed regulations take the position that if the alternativelimitation is used to meet the section 401(k) test for any plan year beginningafter December 31, 1988, it cannot be used to meet the section 401(m) testfor any plan year beginning with or within such 401(k) plan year. Similarly,if the alternative limitation is used to meet the section 401(m) test,it cannot be used to meet the section 401(k) test. There is no limit onmultiple use of the alternative limitation for plan years beginning beforeJanuary 1, 1989. The proposed regulations take the position that the restrictionon the alternative limitation applies only to the overlap group consistingof those highly compensated employees who are eligible to participate inboth a plan subject to section 401(m) and an arrangement subject to section401(k).Section 4979 imposes a ten percent excise tax on excess contributions (amountswhich exceed the limitations of section 401(k)(3)(A)(ii)) and excess aggregatecontributions (amounts which exceed the limitations of section 401(m)(2)(A))if such amounts are not corrected by 2\1/2\ months following the closeof the plan year to which they relate. A plan which does not correct theseamounts by the end of the plan year following the plan year to which theyrelate is disqualified for the plan year to which they relate and all subsequentplan years that they remain in the plan.<ITAG tagnum="84">$7,000 Limit on Elective Deferrals</ITAG>Section 402(g) limits the amount an employee may defer under a cash ordeferred arrangement for any taxable year to $7,000. This amount is increasedto $9,500 for elective deferrals under a salary reduction agreement toa section 403(b) contract.A number of special transition rules relating to section 402(g) were containedin section 1105 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. These transition rules arenot discussed in the proposed regulations, but were discussed in Notice87-13, 1987-4 I.R.B. 14.The proposed regulations set forth the methods and requirements for correctingexcess deferrals. Such deferrals may be corrected in the taxable year inwhich made as well as during the period ending on the first April 15 ofthe subsequent taxable year. The proposed regulations also set forth themanner in which income is computed on excess deferrals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Safe-Harbor Income Rule</ITAG>Section 402(g)(2)(A)(ii) requires that income on an excess deferral bedistributed in order to correct such excess deferral. Similar rules applyunder sections 401(k)(8) and 401(m)(6) to the correction of excess contributionsand excess aggregate contributions, respectively. The proposed regulationsclarify that income attributable to the period between the end of the taxableor plan year and the date of distribution must be distributed in orderto correct such defects. In order to simplify plan administration, theproposed regulations contain an optional safe-harbor rule for determiningincome generated in such period. The income applicable to each month insuch period is ten percent of the income for the previous plan year. Amountsdistributed on or before the fifteenth day of the month are deemed to havebeen distributed on the last day of the preceding month. Amounts distributedafter the fifteenth day of the month are deemed to be distributed on thelast day of the month in which the distribution took place. In the caseof excess deferrals, the taxable year of the participant is used insteadof the plan year. Comments are invited on additional safe-harbor or proceduralmethods appropriate for determining income or loss for the period betweenthe end of the taxable or plan year and the date of distribution.For plan years which begin in 1987, plan sponsors may use any reasonablemethod for computing the gain or loss allocable to excess deferrals, providedthat such method is used consistently for all participants and for allcorrective distributions under a plan for that plan year. A similar ruleis set forth for correction of excess contributions and excess aggregatecontributions.Additional transition rules relating to correction of excess contributions,excess aggregate contributions, and excess deferrals are contained in Notice88-33, 1988-13 I.R.B. 17.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date of the Proposed Regulations</ITAG>These regulations are generally proposed to be effective for plan yearsbeginning after December 31, 1986. However, certain provisions relatingto permitted plan distributions, time of participation, contingent benefits,multiple use of the alternative limitation, and other items are proposedto be effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 1988.A special effective date is provided for plans maintained pursuant to oneor more collective bargaining agreements. This special date is applicableon a plan-wide basis to plans maintained pursuant to one or more collectivebargaining agreements even if such plans cover employees other than thosein a collective bargaining unit. To use the special effective date, atleast twenty-five percent of the plan participants must be members of employeeunits covered by collective bargaining agreements. The special effectivedate must be used for sections 401(k)(2) and (8) as well as for other purposes.An additional special effective date is provided for cash or deferred arrangementsmaintained by state and local governments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Time of Plan Amendments</ITAG>Plan amendments to reflect the changes contained in these proposed regulationsneed not be made until the earlier of plan termination or the dates specifiedin section 1140 of TRA '86 (as amplified by the regulations under section401(b)). This deferred amendment date is available only if (1) the planis operated in accordance with the applicable provisions of TRA '86 forthe period beginning with the effective date of the provision with respectto the plan; and (2) those plan amendments adopted which are required byTRA '86 are retroactive to such effective date and are consistent withplan operations during the retroactive effective period. <ITAG tagnum="84">Reliance on These Proposed Regulations</ITAG>Taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations for guidance pending theissuance of final regulations. Because these regulations are generallyeffective for plan years after 1986, the Service will apply these proposedregulations in issuing determination letters, opinion letters, and otherrulings and in auditing returns with respect to taxpayers and plans. Iffuture guidance is more restrictive, such guidance will be applied withoutretroactive effect.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses</ITAG>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that this proposedrule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291. Therefore,a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. Although this document isa notice of proposed rulemaking which solicits public comment, the InternalRevenue Service has concluded that the regulations proposed herein areinterpretative and that the notice and public procedure requirements of5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply. Accordingly, these proposed regulations do notconstitute regulations subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.chapter 6).<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Requests for Public Hearing</ITAG>Before adopting these proposed regulations, consideration will be givento any written comments that are submitted (preferably eight copies) tothe Commissioner of Internal Revenue. All comments will be available forpublic inspection and copying. A public hearing will be held upon writtenrequest to the Commissioner by any person who has submitted written comments.If a public hearing is held, notice of the time and place will be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of these proposed regulations is William D.

Consistent with andSection; 1.402(a)-1(d),any such elective contributions will constitute after-tax employee contributionsunless the arrangement constitutes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement.For example, the arrangement will constitute a qualified cash or deferredarrangement only if the requirements of section 401(k) and this section(including paragraph (b)) are satisfied. In addition, if such electivecontributions are made under a qualified cash or deferred arrangement,the contributions would constitute after-tax employee contributions tothe extent they exceed the applicable limit under section 402(g). Conversely,if such an arrangement does not constitute a qualified cash or deferredarrangement, the contributions will be includible in the partner's incomeand are not deductible or excludable as employer contributions.

In the event of a reduction under this paragraph (f)(5)(i)(B),the amount of excess contributions includible in the gross income of theemployee and the amount of excess contributions reported by the payor orplan administrator as includible in the gross income of the employee shallbe reduced by the amount of the reduction under this paragraph (f)(5)(i)(B).(ii)<T3> Combination of correction methods.</T3> A plan may use qualified nonelectivecontributions, qualified matching contributions, the recharacterizationmethod, the corrective distribution method, or a combination of these methods,to avoid or correct excess contributions. Thus, for example, with respectto a highly compensated employee who has made excess contributions fora plan year, a portion of the excess contributions may be recharacterizedand the remaining portion of the excess contributions may be distributedunder this subparagraph. A plan may require that, upon commencement ofparticipation, a highly compensated employee may elect whether any excesscontributions are to be recharacterized or distributed. In addition, aplan may permit a highly compensated employee to have all or a portionof the excess contributions on behalf of such employee for a plan yearrecharacterization distributed. Any recharacterization or distributionof less than the entire amount of excess contributions with respect toany highly compensated employee is treated as a pro rata recharacterizationor distribution of excess contributions and allocable income or loss.(iii) <T3>Family Members. </T3>The determination and correction of excess contributionsof a highly compensated employee whose actual deferral ratio is determinedunder the family aggregation rules of paragraph (g)(8) of this sectionis accomplished as follows: If the actual deferral ratio of the highlycompensated employee is determined under paragraph (g)(8)(iii)(A)(<T3>1</T3>) of this section, then the actual deferral ratio is reducedas required under paragraph (f)(2) of this section and the excess contributionsfor the family unit shall be allocated among the family members in proportionto the elective contributions of each family member that are combined todetermine the actual deferral ratio. If the actual deferral ratio of thehighly compensated employees is determined under paragraph (g)(8)(iii)(A)(<T3>2</T3>), then the actual deferral ratio is reduced as required underparagraph (f)(2) of this section in two steps. First, the actual deferralratio is reduced as required under paragraph (f)(2), but not below theactual deferral ratio of the group of eligible family members who are nothighly compensated employees without regard to family aggregation. Excesscontributions are determined by taking into account the contributions ofthe family members whose contributions were combined to determine the actualdeferral ratio of the highly compensated employee under paragraph (g)(8)(iii)(A)(<T3>1</T3>), and shall be allocated among such family members in proportionto each such family member's elective contributions. If further reductionof the actual deferral ratio is required under paragraph (f)(2), excesscontributions resulting from this reduction are determined by taking intoaccount the contributions of all the eligible family members and are allocatedamong such family members in proportion to the elective contributions ofeach family member.(6) <T3>Failure to correct. </T3>(i) If a plan does not correct excess contributionswithin 2\1/2\ months after the close of the plan year for which such excesscontributions are made, the employer will be liable for a 10 percent excisetax on the amount of the excess contributions. See section 4979 and andSection;54.4979-1. Qualified nonelective contributions and qualified matching contributionsproperly taken into account under paragraph (b)(3) of this section fora plan year may permit a plan to avoid having excess contributions evenif such contributions are made after the close of the 2\1/2\ month period.(ii) If excess contributions are not corrected before the close of theplan year following the plan year for which they were made, the cash ordeferred arrangement will fail to meet the requirements of section 401(k)(3)for the plan year for which the excess contributions are made and all subsequentplan years during which the excess contributions remain in the trust.(7) <T3>Examples. </T3>The provisions of this paragraph may be illustratedby the following examples.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>The Y corporation maintains a cash or deferred arrangementdescribed in section 401(k).

(ii) The excess of the actual contribution percentage for the group ofeligible highly compensated employees over the actual contribution percentagefor the group of all other eligible employees is not more than two percentagepoints, and the actual contribution percentage for the group of eligiblehighly compensated employees is not more than the actual contribution percentageof the group of all other eligible employees multiplied by two.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For plan years which begin after December 31, 1988, or such laterdate provided under paragraph (g) of this section, if any highly compensatedemployee is eligible to make elective contributions under a cash or deferredarrangement and to make employee contributions or to receive matching contributionsunder the plan that includes the cash or deferred arrangement or underany other plan of the employer, the disparities between the actual contributionpercentages of the respective groups must be reduced as described in andSection;1.401(m)-2. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), the plan may incorporateby reference the provisions of section 401(m), this section, and andSection;1.401(m)-2. (4)<T3> Aggregation rules</T3>_(i)<T3> Permissive aggregation.</T3> Two or more plans to which employee contributions,matching contributions or both, are made may be considered as a singleplan for purposes of determining whether or not such plans satisfy sections401(a)(4), 401(m), and 410(b). In such a case, the aggregated plans mustsatisfy paragraph (b)(1) of this section and section 401(m) with respectto the amount of the employee contributions and matching contributionsand must satisfy sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b) as though such aggregatedplans were a single plan. If an employee maintains two or more plans thatare treated as a single plan for purposes of section 401(a)(4) or 410(b)(other than, for plan years beginning after December 31, 1988, or suchlater date provided in paragraph (g) of this section, section 410(b)(2)(A)(ii)),all employee contributions and matching contributions are to be treatedas made under the same plan for purposes of sections 401(a)(4), 410(b),and 401(m). (ii)<T3> Impermissible aggregation.</T3> For plan years which begin after December31, 1988, notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section,contributions and allocations under a plan described in section 4975(e)(7)(an ESOP) generally may not be combined with contributions or allocationsunder any plan not described in section 4975(e)(7) (non-ESOP) for purposesof determining whether either the ESOP or the non-ESOP satisfies this paragraph(b) and section 401(a)(4), 401(k), and 410(b). See andSection; 54.4975-11(e),which includes an exception to this rule for certain plans in existenceon November 1, 1977. See also andSection; 54.4975-11(a)(5), which providesthat an ESOP may form a portion of a plan the balance of which includesa qualified pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plan which is not anESOP. Thus, for example, in determining whether matching contributionsunder the portion of a plan that is not an ESOP satisfy paragraph (b) andsection 401(a)(4), and whether nonelective contributions under the portionof the plan that is an ESOP satisfy section 401(a)(4), such matching contributionsand nonelective contributions may not be considered together. Thus, withrespect to such matching contributions, the nonelective contributions maynot be treated as qualified nonelective contributions. (iii)<T3> Plans must have same plan year.</T3> For plan years which begin afterDecember 31, 1989, or such later date provided in paragraph (g) of thissection, plans may be aggregated under this paragraph (b)(4)(iii) onlyif they have the same plan year. (5)<T3> Employee and matching contributions taken into account for a planyear</T3>_(i)<T3> Employee contributions.</T3> An employee contribution is taken intoaccount under this paragraph for a plan year in which such amounts arecontributed to the trust. Payment by the employee to an agent of the planshall, for such purposes, be treated as a contribution to the trust atthe time of payment to the agent if the funds so paid are transmitted tothe trust within a reasonable period after the payment to the agent. Excesscontributions that are recharacterized under andSection; 1.401(k)-1(f)(2)are taken into account as employee contributions for the plan year thatincludes the time at which such excess contributions are includible inthe gross income of the employee under andSection; 1.401(k)-1(f)(2)(ii).(ii)<T3> Matching contributions.</T3> A matching contribution is taken intoaccount under this paragraph for a plan year only if such contributionis allocated to the employee's account under the terms of the plan as ofany date within the plan year, is actually paid to the trust no later thanthe end of the twelve-month period beginning on the day after the closeof such plan year, and is made on behalf of an employee on account of suchemployee's elective contributions or employee contributions for the planyear. Matching contributions that do not satisfy all of the preceding requirementsmay not be taken into account under paragraph (b) for any plan year, butinstead must satisfy section 401(a)(4) (without regard to the special nondiscriminationrule in this paragraph (b)) for the plan year for which allocated as ifthey were the only employer contributions for that year. (c) <T3>Additional requirements</T3>_(1) <T3>Nondiscrimination requirements.</T3> A plan to which employee contributionsor matching contributions may be made satisfies section 401(a)(4) onlyif, in addition to satisfying paragraph (b) of this section with respectto the amount of employee contributions and matching contributions, suchplan also satisfies section 401(a)(4) with respect to other benefits, rightsand features under the plan, including the availability of employee contributionsand the availability of matching contributions. Also, the method of distributingexcess aggregate contributions provided in the plan must meet the requirementsof section 401(a)(4). See paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section. The determinationof whether a rate of matching contributions discriminates under section401(a)(4) shall be made after any corrective distributions of excess deferrals,excess contributions, and excess aggregate contributions. See also andSection;1.401(a)-4 with respect to optional forms of benefit. (2) <T3>Recordkeeping requirement.</T3> A plan does not satisfy this sectionunless the employer maintains such records as are necessary to demonstratecompliance with the applicable rules of section 401(m) and the regulationsthereunder. Among other requirements, such records must be sufficient todemonstrate satisfaction of the applicable nondiscrimination requirementof paragraph (b) of this section, including the extent to which qualifiednonelective contributions and elective contributions are taken into account.(d) <T3>Examples.</T3> The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (c) of thissection may be illustrated by the following examples. Assume in each casethat the employer is a corporation, and that the employer's taxable yearand plan year are both the calendar year. Also assume that the employeecontributions, elective contributions, matching contributions and qualifiednonelective contributions meet the applicable requirements of sections401(a)(4) and 410. For methods to be used to correct excess aggregate contributions,see paragraph (e) of this section. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> Employer L maintains a voluntary employee contributionaccount under a profit-sharing plan.

Similarly, the actual contribution percentagesfor the two groups are 6 and 5 respectively, thus satisfying the 125 percenttest. </ITAG>(e) <T3>Correction of excess aggregate contributions.</T3>_(1) <T3>In general.</T3> A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet therequirements of section 401(m) or paragraph (b)(3) of this section withrespect to the amount of employee contributions and matching contributionsunder such plan if the employer, in accordance with the terms of the planand paragraph (b)(2) of this section, makes qualified nonelective contributionsthat, in combination with employee contributions or matching contributionsfor the plan year, satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of thissection. In addition, a plan subject to the requirements of section 401(m)will not be treated as failing to satisfy section 401(m)(2) or paragraph(b)(3) of this section if, in accordance with the terms of the plan, excessaggregate contributions (and the income allocable to such contributions)are distributed (or, if forfeitable under the terms of the plan, forfeited)in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Matching contributionsthat are vested may not be forfeited to correct excess aggregate contributions.Neither recharacterization of excess aggregate contributions nor the failureto make matching contributions required under the terms of the plan isa permitted method of correction. See paragraph (e)(5) of this sectionwith respect to the failure to correct excess aggregate contributions.Excess aggregate contributions for a plan year may not remain unallocatedor be allocated to a suspense account for allocation to one or more employeesin any future year. (2) <T3>Amount of excess aggregate contributions.</T3> The amount of excessaggregate contributions for a highly compensated employee for a plan yearis to be determined by the following leveling method, under which the actualcontribution ratio of the highly compensated employee with the highestactual contribution ratio is reduced to the extent required to_ (i) Enable the plan to satisfy the actual contribution percentage test,or(ii) Cause such highly compensated employee's actual contribution ratioto equal the ratio of the highly compensated employee with the next highestactual contribution ratio. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This process must be repeated until the plan satisfies the actualcontribution percentage test. For each highly compensated employee, theamount of excess aggregate contributions is equal to the total employeecontributions and matching contributions, plus qualified nonelective contributionsand elective contributions treated as matching contributions, on behalfof the employee (determined prior to the application of this paragraph(e)(2)) minus the amount determined by multiplying the employee's actualcontribution ratio (determined after application of this paragraph (e)(2))by his compensation used in determining such ratio. For plan years whichbegin after 1988, or such later date provided in paragraph (g) of thissection, in determining the amount of excess aggregate contributions underthis method, actual contribution ratios must be rounded to the nearestone-hundredth of one percent of the employee's compensation. In no caseshall the amount of excess aggregate contributions with respect to anyhighly compensated employee exceed the amount of employee contributionsand matching contributions on behalf of such highly compensated employeefor such plan year. (3) <T3>Corrective distribution of excess aggregate contributions (and income)</T3>_(i)<T3>General rule.</T3> Excess aggregate contributions (and income allocablethereto) are corrected in accordance with this paragraph (e)(3) only ifsuch excess aggregate contributions and allocable income are designatedby the employer as a distribution of excess aggregate contributions (andincome) and are distributed to the appropriate highly compensated employeesafter the close of the plan year in which the excess aggregate contributionarose and within twelve months after the close of the following plan year.In the event of the complete termination of the plan during the plan yearin which an excess aggregate contribution arose, such distributions areto be made after termination of the plan and before the close of the twelve-monthperiod immediately following such termination. (ii) <T3>Income allocable to excess aggregate contributions</T3>_(A) <T3>General rule.</T3> The income allocable to excess aggregate contributionsis equal to the sum of the allocable gain or loss for the plan year andthe allocable gain or loss for the period between the end of the plan yearand the date of distribution. Income includes all earnings and appreciation,including such items as interest, dividends, rent, royalties, gains fromthe sale of property, appreciation in the value of stocks, bonds, annuityand life insurance contracts, and other property, without regard to whethersuch appreciation has been realized. (B) <T3>Allocable income for the plan year</T3>. The income allocable to excessaggregate contributions for the plan year is determined by multiplyingthe income for the plan year allocable to employee contributions, matchingcontributions, and amounts treated as matching contributions by a fraction.The numerator of the fraction is the amount of excess aggregate contributionsmade on behalf of the employee for the plan year. The denominator of thefraction is the total account balance of the employee attributable to employeecontributions, matching contributions and amounts treated as matching contributionsas of the end of the plan year, reduced by the gain allocable to such totalamount for the plan year and increased by the loss allocable to such totalamount for the plan year.(C) <T3>Allocable income for the period between the end of the plan year anddate of corrective distribution</T3>. The income allocable to excess aggregatecontributions for the period between the end of the plan year and the dateof a corrective distribution may be calculated under the fractional methodset forth in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, or alternatively,under the following safe harbor method. Under the fractional method, theincome for the period between the end of the plan year and the last dayof the month preceding the distribution date that is allocable to employeecontributions, matching contributions and amounts treated as matching contributionsis multiplied by a fraction determined under the method described in paragraph(e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. Under the safe harbor method, the allocableincome or loss for the period between the end of the plan year and thedistribution date is equal to 10 percent of the income or loss allocableto excess aggregate contributions for the plan year (as calculated underparagraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section) multiplied by the number of calendarmonths that have elapsed since the end of the plan year. For purposes ofdetermining the number of calendar months that have elapsed under the safeharbor method, a distribution occurring on or before the fifteenth dayof the month will be treated as having been made on the last day of thepreceding month, and a distribution occurring after such fifteenth daywill be treated as having been made on the first day of the next month.(D) <T3>Allocable income for recharacterized elective contributions</T3>. Theincome allocable to excess aggregate contributions resulting from the recharacterizationof elective contributions shall be determined and distributed as if suchrecharacterized elective contributions had been distributed as excess contributions.(E) <T3>Special rules for plan years which begin in 1987. </T3>For plan yearswhich begin in 1987, plan sponsors may use any reasonable method for computingthe income allocable to excess aggregate contributions, provided that suchmethod is used consistently for all participants and for all correctivedistributions under a plan for that plan year. The closing balance methodis a reasonable method for this purpose. Under the closing balance method,the income allocable to the excess aggregate contribution is equal to thesum of (<T3>1</T3>) the income allocable to the account containing the excess aggregatecontribution for the applicable year, and (<T3>2</T3>) the income allocable to such account for the gap period, multipliedby a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the excess aggregate contributionand the denominator is the closing balance (as of the end of the applicableyear) of the account containing the excess aggregate contribution. Theclosing balance includes income for the applicable year. A method willnot be considered unreasonable if gains or losses between the end of theplan year and the date of distribution (``gap period'') are not taken intoaccount.(iii) <T3>Treatment of corrective distributions as employer contributions</T3>.Excess aggregate contributions attributable to amounts other than employeecontributions, including forfeited matching contributions, shall be treatedas employer contributions for purposes of section 404 and 415 even if distributedfrom the plan.(iv) <T3>No employee or spousal consent required</T3>. A distribution of excessaggregate contributions (and income) may be made under the terms of theplan without regard to any notice or consent otherwise required under sections411(a)(11) and 417.(v) <T3>Tax treatment</T3>. A corrective distribution of excess aggregate contributions(and income) under the terms of the plan is includible in gross incomefor the taxable year of the employee ending with or within the plan yearfor which the excess aggregate contributions were made or, if distributedmore than 2\1/2\ months after the plan year for which such excess aggregatecontributions were made, in the taxable year of the employee in which distributed.The portion of such distribution that is treated as an investment in thecontract is to be determined without regard to any plan contributions otherthan those distributed as excess aggregate contributions. In addition,such a corrective distribution of excess aggregate contributions (and income)is not subject to the early distribution tax of section 72(t) and is nottreated as a distribution for purposes of applying the excise tax undersection 4981A.(vi) <T3>No reduction of required minimum distribution</T3>. A distributionof excess aggregate contributions (and income) is not treated as a distributionfor purposes of determining whether the plan satisfied the minimum distributionrequirements of section 401(a)(9).(vii) <T3>Partial correction</T3>. Any distribution of less than the entire amountof excess aggregate contributions (and income) is treated as a pro ratadistribution of excess aggregate contributions and income.(viii) <T3>Method of distributing excess aggregate contributions</T3>. Any distributionor forfeiture of excess aggregate contributions for any plan year shallbe made on the basis of the respective portions of such amounts attributableto each highly compensated employee.(4) <T3>Special rules</T3>_(i) <T3>Coordination with correction of excess contributions and excess deferrals</T3>.The determination of the amount of excess aggregate contributions withrespect to a plan year shall be made after determining the excess contributions,if any, to be treated as employee contributions due to recharacterizationunder section 401(k) for the plan year of the plan subject to section 401(k)ending with the plan year of the plan being tested under section 401(m).(ii) <T3>Coordination with section 401(a)(4). </T3>The method of distributingexcess aggregate contributions provided in the plan must meet the requirementsof section 401(a)(4). Thus, a plan under which employee contributions aredistributed under this paragraph (e) to highly compensated employees tothe extent needed to meet the requirements of section 401(m)(2), whilematching contributions attributable to such employee contributions remainallocated to the highly compensated employee's account will not meet therequirements of section 401(a)(4). A method of distributing excess aggregatecontributions will not be considered discriminatory solely because, inaccordance with the terms of the plan, unmatched employee contributionsthat exceed the highest rate at which employee contributions are matchedare distributed before matched employee contributions, or matching contributionsare distributed (or forfeited) prior to employee contributions. See Examples(5) and (6) in paragraph (e)(6) of this section.(iii) <T3>Correction of family members. </T3>The determination and correctionof excess aggregate contributions of a highly compensated employee whoseactual contribution ratio is determined under the family aggregation rulesof paragaph (f)(13) is accomplished as follows: If the actual contributionratio of the highly compensated employee is determined under paragraph(f)(13)(iii)(<T3>1</T3>) of this section, then the actual contribution ratio is reducedas required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section and the excess aggregatecontributions for the family unit shall be allocated among the family membersin proportion to the employee contributions and matching contributionsof each family member that are combined to determine the actual contributionratio. If the actual contribution ratio of the highly compensated employeeis determined under paragraph (f)(13)(iii)(<T3>2</T3>) of this section, then the actual contribution ratio is reducedas required under paragraph (e)(2) in two steps. First, the actual contributionratio is reduced as required under paragraph (e)(2), but not below theactual contribution ratio of the group of eligible employees who are membersof the family group and are not highly compensated without regard to familyaggregation. Excess aggregate contributions are determined by taking intoaccount the contributions of the family members whose contributions werecombined to determine the actual contribution ratio of the highly compensatedemployee under paragraph (f)(13)(iii)(<T3>1</T3>), and shall be allocated among such family members in proportionto each such family member's employee contributions and matching contributions.If further reduction of the actual contribution ratio is required underparagraph (e)(2), excess aggregate contributions resulting from this reductionare determined by taking into account the contributions of all the eligiblefamily members and are allocated among such family members in proportionto the employee contributions and matching contributions of each familymember.(5) <T3>Failure to correct. </T3>(i) If a plan does not correct excess aggregatecontributions within 2\1/2\ months after the close of the plan year forwhich such excess aggregate contributions are made, the employer will beliable for a 10 percent excise tax on the amount of the excess aggregatecontributions. See section 4979 and andSection; 54.4979-1. Qualified nonelectivecontributions properly taken into account under paragraph (b)(2) for aplan year may permit a plan to avoid having excess aggregate contributionseven if such contributions are made after the close of the 2\1/2\ monthperiod.(ii) If excess aggregate contributions are not corrected by the close ofthe plan year following the plan year for which they were made, the planwill fail to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(4) for the plan yearfor which the excess aggregate contributions were made and all subsequentplan years in which the excess aggregate contributions remain in the plan.(6) <T3>Examples.</T3> The principles of this paragraph may be illustratedby the following examples. Assume in each example that no income or lossis allocable to matching contributions, employee contributions or electivecontributions.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> Employer A maintains a thrift plan under which theactual contribution percentage for nonhighly compensated employees is fourpercent.

Thus A's contribution is first reduced to $7000or 7.0 percent. Because the actual contribution percentage after this reductionis still 6.33%, the contributions allocated to A and B must be reducedto 6.5%. This results in an actual contribution percentage of six percent,which meets the 200 percent/2 percentage point test. The excess aggregatecontributions for A and B are $3,500 and $450 respectively.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Employee A is the sole highly compensated participantin cash or deferred arrangements maintained by unrelated employers X andY. Plan X provides a fully vested 50% matching contribution. Both plansuse the calendar year as the plan year. Plan X corrects excess contributionsby recharacterization. For the 1988 plan year, A's compensation from employerX is $58,333 and his elective contributions under the X plan is $7000.A made an elective contribution of $1000 under plan Y. The actual deferralratios and percentages and actual contribution ratios and percentages ofA and other employees under plan X are shown below:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,8,8</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Actual deferral ratios (percentage)</H1><H1>Actual contribution, ratios, (percentage)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Employee A<D>12</D><D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nonhighly compensated <D>8</D><D>4</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In January, A requests and receives a distribution of the $1000 excessdeferral from plan X. This does not reduce the amount taken into accountin determining A's actual deferral ratio under plan X. In February, employerX determines that A's actual deferral ratio must be reduced to 10%, or$5833, which requires a recharacterization of $1167. The amount requiredto be recharacterized is reduced by the $1000 previously distributed asan excess deferral. The $167 recharacterized as an employee contributioncauses A's actual contribution ratio to exceed the permitted maximum andrequires a distribution of $167. This distribution may be made from matchingcontributions, from unmatched employee contributions or pro rata from employeeand matching contributions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>Same as <T3>Example </T3>(2), except that A does not request a distribution ofexcess deferrals until March. In this case Employer X would have alreadyrecharacterized $1167 as employee contributions, thus requiring a distributionof $1167 in excess aggregate contributions. Because the amount recharacterizedexceeds the amount of excess deferrals and will be distributed as an excessaggregate contribution, no further amounts can or need be distributed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>For the 1989 plan year, employee B defers $7000 underplan C and $1000 under plan D. Plans C and D are maintained by unrelatedemployers; both plans C and D have a calendar year plan year. Plan C providesa 100 percent matching contribution and does not take elective contributionsinto account under section 401(m) or take matching contributions into accountunder section 401(k). B timely requests and receives a distribution ofthe $1000 excess deferral from plan C. Employer C subsequently determinesthat employee B has an excess contribution of $600, and an excess aggregatecontribution of $600. The plan provides that such excess amounts are correctedby distribution. No distribution is required or permitted to correct theexcess contribution because $1000 has been distributed from this plan asexcess deferrals. The distribution required to correct the excess aggregatecontribution is $600. If B had corrected the excess deferrals of $1,000by withdrawing $1,000 from plan D, the employer would have had to correctthe $600 excess contribution in Plan C by distributing $600 from Plan Cand the $600 of excess aggregate contributions n plan C distributing anadditional $600 from Plan C.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (5). </T3>Employee A is the sole highly compensated employeein a thrift plan under which the employer matches 100 percent of the firstfour percent of employee contributions. For the 1988 plan year, A has compensationof $100,000. A makes an employee contribution of $6,000, or six percentand receives a for percent matching contribution of $4,000. This, A's actualcontribution ratio (ACR) is ten percent. The actual contribution percentagefor the non-highly compensated employees if four percent, and the employerdetermines that A's ACR must be reduced to six percent to comply with therules of section 401(m). In this case, the plan satisfies the requirementsof this paragraph if it distributes the unmatched employee contributions($2,000) plus $1,000 of matched employee contributions with its $1,000of matching contributions, leaving three percent in employee contributionsand three percent in matching contributions for an ACR of six percent.The plan could instead have distributed all matching contributions. Theplan would fail to meet the requirements of this paragraph if it distributed$4,000 (four percent) of A's employee contributions and none of A's matchingcontributions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (6). </T3>Employee B is the sole highly compensated employeein a thrift plan under which the employer matches 100 percent of the firsttwo percent of employee contribution and 50 percent of the next four percentof employee contributions. For the 1988 plan year, B has compensation of$100,000. B makes an employee contribution of $7,000, or seven percent,and receives a four percent matching contribution of $4,000. Thus, B'sACR is eleven percent. The actual contribution percentages for the non-highlycompensated employees is five percent, and the employer determines thatB's ACR must be reduced to seven percent to comply with the rules of section401(m). In this case, the plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraphif it distributes the unmatched employee contributions of $1,000, and $2,000of matched employee contributions with their accompanying matches of $1,000.This would leave B with four percent employee contributions, and threepercent matching contributions, for an ACR of seven percent. The plan couldinstead distribute all matching contributions. The plan would fail to meetthe requirements of this paragraph if it distributed $4,000 (four percent)of B's employee contributions and none of B's matching contributions.</ITAG>(f) <T3>Definitions. </T3>The following is a list of terms and definitionsto be used for purposes of section 401(m), this section, and andSection;1.401(m)-2.(1) <T3>Employee. </T3>The term ``employee'' means an individual who performsservices for the employer and who is either a common law employee of theemployer or a self-employed individual treated as an employee pursuantto section 401(c)(1). The term ``employee'' also includes a leased employeewho is treated as an employee of the employer-recipient pursuant to theprovisions of section 414(n)(2) or 414(o)(2) (other than individuals coveredby a plan described in section 414(n)(5)). Individuals that an employertreats as leased employees under section 414(n), pursuant to the requirementsof section 414(o), are considered to be leased employees for purposes ofthis rule.(2) <T3>Employer.</T3> The term ``employer'' means the employer maintainingthe plan and those employers required to be aggregated with such employerunder sections 414(b), (c), (m), or (o).(3) <T3>Eligible employee_</T3>(i) <T3>In general.</T3> The term ``eligible employee'' means an employee whois directly or indirectly eligible to make an employee contribution orto receive an allocation of matching contributions (including matchingcontributions derived from forfeitures) under the plan for a plan year.For example, if an employee must perform certain acts in order to be eligibleto make an employee contribution for a plan year, such employee is an eligibleemployee for such plan year without regard to whether the employee performssuch acts. An employee is an eligible employee if he is unable to makean employee contribution or to receive an allocation of matching contributionsmerely because his compensation is less than a stated dollar amount. Anemployee who would be eligible to make employee contributions but for asuspension due to a distribution, a loan, or an election not to participatein the plan, will not fail to be an eligible employee for purposes of section401(m) for a plan year merely because the employee may not make an employeecontribution or receive an allocation of matching contributions by reasonof such suspension. Finally, an employee will not fail to be an eligibleemployee merely because the employee may receive no additional annual additionsbecause of section 415(c)(1) or 415(e).(ii) <T3>Certain one-time elections.</T3> An employee is not an eligible employeemerely because such employee, upon commencing employment with the employeror upon the employee's first becoming eligible under any plan, is giventhe one-time opportunity to elect, and such employee did in fact elect,not to be eligible to make employee contributions or to receive allocationsof matching contributions under such plan or any other plan maintainedby the employer (including plans not yet established) for the durationof the employee's employment with the employer.(4) <T3>Highly compensated employee.</T3> The term ``highly compensated employee''has the meaning set forth in section 414(q).(5) <T3>Elective contribution.</T3> The term ``elective contribution'' hasthe meaning set forth in andSection;1.401(k)-1(g)(4).(6) <T3>Nonelective contribution.</T3> The term ``nonelective contribution''has the meaning set forth in andSection;1.401(k)-1(g)(5).(7) <T3>Employee contributions.</T3> The term ``employee contributions'' meansany contributions to the plan that are designated or treated at the timeof deferral or contribution as after-tax employee contributions (e.g.,by reporting the contributions as taxable income subject to applicablewithholding requirements) and are allocated to a separate account to whichthe attributable earnings and losses are allocated. See andSection;1.401(k)-1(a)(2)(ii).Such term includes_(i) Employee contributions to the defined contribution portion of a plandescribed in section 414(k),(ii) Employee contributions to a qualified cost-of-living arrangement describedin section 415(k)(2)(B),(iii) Employee contributions applied to the purchase of whole life insuranceprotection or survivor benefit protection under a defined contributionplan,(iv) Amounts attributable to excess contributions within the meaning ofsection 401(k)(8)(B) which are recharacterized as employee contributions,and(v) Employee contributions to a contract described in section 403(b).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Such term does not include repayment of loans or buy-backs of benefitsdescribed in section 411(a)(7)(C) or employee contributions which are transferredto a plan. For purposes of this paragraph (f), employee contributions describedin paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section shall be deemed contributed toa defined contribution plan.(8) <T3>Matching contribution.</T3> The term ``matching contribution'' means_(i) Any employer contribution made to a plan on account of an employeecontribution to a plan maintained by the employer;(ii) Any employer contribution made to a plan on account of an electivecontribution to a plan maintained by the employer; and(iii) Any forfeiture allocated on the basis of employee contributions,matching contributions, or elective contributions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of paragraphs (f)(8) (i) and (ii) of this section, whetheran employer contribution is made on account of an employee contributionor an elective contribution will be determined on the basis of all relevantfacts and circumstances, including the relationship between the employercontribution and employee actions outside the plan. Thus, for example,an employer contribution made to a plan on account of contributions madeby an employee under an employer-sponsored savings arrangement that arenot held in a plan that is intended to be a qualified plan shall not constitutea matching contribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for plan yearsbeginning before January 1, 1989, an employer may elect to take into accountas matching contributions, contributions made to a plan pursuant to anarrangement under which the employer makes contributions to the plan onaccount of either employee contributions to the plan or contributions madeby an employee to an employer-sponsored savings arrangement that are notheld in the plan, provided that such arrangement was in effect prior toAugust 8, 1988.For plan years which begin after December 31, 1988, a contribution and/orallocation that is used to meet the minimum contribution or benefit requirementof section 416, is not treated as made on account of an employee or electivecontribution and therefore is not a matching contribution.(9) <T3>Qualified nonelective contributions. </T3>The term ``qualified nonelectivecontributions'' has the meaning set forth in andSection; 1.401(k)-1(g)(7)(ii).(10) <T3>Excess deferrals._</T3>The term ``excess deferrals'' has the meaningset forth in andSection; 1.402(g)-1(b)(2).(11) <T3>Excess contributions. </T3>The term ``excess contributions'' has themeaning set forth in andSection; 1.401(k)-1(g)(13).(12) <T3>Excess aggregate contributions._</T3>The term ``excess aggregate contributions''means, with respect to any plan year, the excess of the aggregate amountof the matching contributions and employee contributions (and any qualifiednonelective contribution or elective deferrals taken into account in computingthe contribution percentage) actually made on behalf of highly compensatedemployees for such plan year, over the maximum amount of such contributionspermitted under the limitations of section 401(m)(2)(A). The amount ofexcess aggregate contributions for each highly compensated employee isdetermined by using the method described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.For purposes of this definition, qualified matching contributions treatedas elective contributions in accordance with andSection; 1.401(k)-1(b)(3)shall be disregarded.(13) <T3>Actual contribution percentage</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>The term ``actual contribution percentage'' meansthe average of the actual contribution ratios (calculated separately foreach employee in a specified group) of the sum of_(A) The matching contributions(B) The employee contributions,(C) The qualified nonelective contributions taken into account under paragraph(f)(2) of this section, and(D) The elective contributions taken into account under paragraph (f)(1)of this section,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">for each plan year, divided by the employee's compensation for suchplan year. For plan years which begin after December 31, 1988, or suchlater date provided in paragraph (g) of this section, such actual contributionratios and the actual contribution percentage for each group shall be calculatedto the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. Matching contributions treatedas elective contributions shall be taken into account only as providedin andSection; 1.401(k)-1(b)(3).(ii) <T3>Highly compensated employees. </T3>In the case of a highly compensatedemployee who is eligible to participate in two or more plans of an employerto which matching contributions, employee contributions, or both, are made,all such contributions on behalf of such highly compensated employee mustbe aggregated for purposes of determining such employee's actual contributionratio.(iii) <T3>Aggregation of family members. </T3>(A) For plan years beginning afterDecember 31, 1986, or such later date provided in paragraph (h) of thissection, if an eligible highly compensated employee is subject to the familyaggregation rules of section 414(q)(6) because such employee is eithera five-percent owner or one of the ten most highly compensated employees,the combined actual contribution ratio for the family group (which is treatedas one highly compensated employee) shall be the greater of:(<T3>1</T3>) The actual contribution ratio determined by combining the employeecontributions, matching contributions of all the eligible family memberswho are highly compensated without regard to family aggregation, and (<T3>2</T3>) The actual contribution ratio determined by combining the employeecontributions, compensation, matching contributions and amounts treatedas matching contributions of all the eligible family members.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">If the amount determined under paragraph (f)(13)(iii)(A) (<T3>1</T3>) of this section exceeds the amount determined under paragraph(f)(13)(iii)(A) (<T3>2</T3>) of this section, then it may be necessary, for purposes ofcorrecting excess aggregate contributions of the family members under paragraph(e)(4)(iii) of this section, to calculate an actual contribution ratiofor the group of eligible family members who are not highly compensatedwithout regard to family aggregation. This actual contribution ratio isdetermined by combining the employee contibutions, compensation, matchingcontributions and amounts treated as matching contributions of all suchemployees.(B) The employee contributions, matching contributions compensation, andamounts treated as matching contributions of all family members are disregardedfor purposes of determining the actual contribution percentage for thegroup of highly compensated employees, and the group of nonhighly compensatedemployees, except to the extent taken into account in paragraph (f)(13)(iii)(A)of this section.(C) If an employee is required to be aggregated as a member of more thanone family group in a plan, all eligible employees who are members of thosefamily groups that include that employee are aggregated as one family groupin accordance with paragraphs (f)(13)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section.(14) <T3>Compensation.</T3> The term ``compensation'' has the meaning givensuch term by section 414(s). For plan years beginning after December 31,1988, or on or after the later date provided under paragraph (g) of thissection, the applicable period under section 414(s) for purposes of applyingthis section is the plan year for which a determination under paragraph(b) is being made. Thus, in the case of an employee who begins, resumes,or ceases to be eligible to make employee contributions or to receive allocationsof matching contributions during a plan year, the amount of compensationreceived by the employee during the entire plan year shall be taken intoaccount for such plan year. Also for such plan years, in computing theactual contribution ratio for an employee for the first plan year of theplan, the amount of compensation received by such employee during the entire12-month period ending on the close of such plan year shall be taken intoaccount.(g) <T3>Effective dates._</T3>(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (g)(2),(g)(3), (g)(4), and (g)(5), or as specifically provided otherwise in thissection, this section is effective for plan years which begin after December31, 1986.(2) In the case of a plan maintained pursuant to one or more collectivebargaining agreements between employee representatives and one or moreemployers ratified before March 1, 1986, this section shall not apply toyears beginning before the earlier of_(i) Janaury 1, 1989, or,(ii) The date on which the last of such collective bargaining agreementsterminates (determined without regard to any extension thereof after February28, 1986).(3) In the case of an annuity contract (not maintained pursuant to a collectivebargaining agreement) under section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Codeof 1986, this section shall apply to plan years beginning after December31, 1988.(4) In the case of an annuity contract described in section 403(b) (maintainedpursuant to a collective bargaining agreement described in paragraph (g)(2)of this section) this section shall not apply to years beginning beforethe earlier of(i) The later of_(A) January 1, 1989, or(B) The date determined under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, or(ii) January 1, 1991.(5)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section, in thecase of a plan maintained by a state or local government, the provisionsof this section shall apply for plan years which begin after December 31,1988.(ii) In the case of a plan maintained pursuant to one or more collectivebargaining agreements between employee representatives and state or localgovernments, this section shall not apply to plan years beginning beforethe earlier of_(A) The later of_(<T3>1</T3>) January 1, 1989, or(<T3>2</T3>) The date on which the last such collective bargaining agreementterminates (determined without regard to any extension thereof after February28, 1986), or(B) January 1, 1991.Par. 12.

Thus, an individual's elective deferrals inexcess of the applicable limit for a taxable year (i.e., the individual'sexcess deferrals for such year) must be included in such individual's grossincome for such year.(b) <T3>Elective deferrals. </T3>An individual's elective deferrals for a taxableyear are the sum of the following:(1) Any elective contribution under a qualified cash or deferred arrangement(as defined in section 401(k)) to the extent such contribution is not includiblein the individual's gross income for the taxable year on account of section402(a)(8).(2) Any employer contribution to a simplified employee pension (as definedin section 408(k)) to the extent such contribution is not includible inthe individual's gross income for the taxable year on account of section402(h)(1)(B).(3) Any employer contribution to an annuity contract under section 403(b)under a salary reduction agreement (within the meaning of section 3121(a)(5)(D))to the extent such contribution is not includible in the individual's grossincome for the taxable year on account of section 403(b).(4) Any employee contribution designated as deductible under a trust describedin section 501(c)(18) to the extent that such contribution is deductiblefrom such individual's income for the taxable year on account of section501(c)(18). For purposes of this section, such employee contribution shallbe treated as though it were excluded from the individual's gross income.(c) <T3>Applicable limit</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as adjusted under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)of this section, the applicable limit for an individual's taxable yearbeginning in the 1987 calendar year is $7,000. Such amount is to be increasedfor the taxable year beginning in 1988 and subsequent calendar years inthe same manner as the $90,000 amount is adjusted under section 415(d).(2) <T3>Special adjustment for elective deferrals with respect to a section403(b) annuity contract. </T3>The applicable limit for an individual whomakes elective deferrals described in paragraph (b)(3) of this sectionfor a taxable year is to be adjusted by increasing the applicable limitotherwise determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the amountof the individual's elective deferrals described in paragraph (b)(3) ofthis section for such taxable year. This adjustment shall not cause theapplicable limit for any taxable year to exceed $9,500.(3) <T3>Special adjustment for elective deferrals with respect to a section403(b) annuity contract for certain long-term employees. </T3>The applicablelimit for an individual who is a qualified employee (as defined in section402(g)(8)(C)) and has elective deferrals described in paragraph (b)(3)of this section for a taxable year is to be adjusted by increasing theapplicable limit otherwise determined under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2)of this section in accordance with section 402(g)(8)(A).(4) <T3>Example. </T3>The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated bythe following example.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example. </T3>An employer (X) maintains a section 401(k) cash or deferredarrangement and also offers its employees section 403(b) contracts to whichelective deferrals may be made. For the 1987 taxable year, three of X'semployees, A, B, and C, contribute $3,500, $1,000 and $8,500, respectively,as elective deferrals under the section 403(b) contract. The maximum amountsthat A, B, and C may contribute to the section 401(k) cash or deferredarrangement are $6,000, $7,000 and $1,000 respectively.</ITAG>(d) <T3>Treatment of excess deferrals_</T3>(1) <T3>Plan qualification. </T3>A plan, annuity contract, simplified employeepension, or trust shall not fail to meet the requirements of section 401(a),section 403(b), section 408(k), or section 501(c)(18), respectively, merelybecause excess deferrals are made with respect to such plan, contract,pension, or trust. For purposes of applying the requirements of section401(a)(4), 401(k)(3), and 415, to a plan or arrangement, excess deferralsare not to be disregarded merely because they are excess deferrals or becausethey are distributed in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.However, excess deferrals by nonhighly compensated employees are not tobe taken into account under section 401(k)(3) to the extent such excessdeferrals are made under a plan or plans of the same employer.(2) <T3>Correction of excess deferrals after the taxable year</T3>. A planmay provide that, if any amount is included in the gross income of an individualunder paragraph (a) of this section for a taxable year_(i) Not later than the first April 15 (or such earlier date as the planmay specify) following the close of the individual's taxable year, theindividual may notify each plan under which deferrals were made of theamount of the excess deferrals received by such plan, and(ii) Not later than the first April 15 following the close of the taxableyear, each such plan may distribute to the individual the amount specifiedunder paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section (and any income allocable tosuch amount).(3) <T3>Correction of excess deferrals during taxable year</T3>. (i) A planmay provide that an individual who has excess deferrals for a taxable yearmay receive a corrective distribution of such deferrals during the sameyear. Such corrective distribution may be made only if all of the followingconditions are satisfied.(A) The individual designates the distribution as an excess deferral.(B) The correcting distribution is made after the date on which the planreceived the excess deferral.(C) The plan designates the distribution as a distribution of excess deferrals.(ii) The provisions of this paragraph (d)(3) may be illustrated by thefollowing example:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example</T3>. S is a 62 year old individual who participates in hisemployer's qualified cash or deferred arrangement. In January, 1989, Swithdraws $5,000 from his employer's cash or deferred arrangement. Forthe period February through November, S defers $800 per month. In Januaryof 1990, S becomes aware of his $1000 excess deferral for 1989. S mustmake an additional withdrawal of $1,000 before April 15, 1990 to correctthe excess deferral. The $5,000 withdrawal did not correct the excess deferralbecause it occurred before the excess deferral was made.</ITAG>(4) <T3>Plan provisions</T3>. In order to distribute excess deferrals pursuantto paragraphs (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section, a plan must contain languagepermitting distribution of excess deferrals. A plan may require the specificationin paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section to be in writing and mayrequire that the employee certify or otherwise establish that the specifiedamount is an excess deferral. A plan need not permit distribution of excessdeferrals.(5) <T3>Income allocable to excess deferrals</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule</T3>. The income allocable to excess deferrals is equalto the sum of the allocable gain or loss for the taxable year of the individualand the allocable gain or loss for the period between the end of the taxableyear and the date of distribution. Income includes all earnings and appreciation,including such items as interest, dividends, rent, royalties, gains fromthe sale of property, appreciation in the value of stocks, bonds, annuityand life insurance contracts, and other property, without regard to whethersuch appreciation has been realized.(ii) <T3>Allocable income for the taxable year</T3>. The income allocable toexcess deferrals for the taxable year of the individual is determined bymultiplying the income for the taxable year of the individual allocableto elective deferrals by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is theamount of excess deferrals made by the employee for the taxable year. Thedenominator of the fraction is the total account balance of the employeeattributable to elective deferrals as of the end of the taxable year, reducedby the gain allocable to such total amount for the taxable year and increasedby the loss allocable to such total amount for the taxable year.(iii) <T3>Allocable income for the period between the end of the taxable yearand time of distribution</T3>. The income allocable to excess deferralsfor the period between the end of the taxable year and the date of distributionmay be calculated under the fractional method set forth in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)of this section or, alternatively, under the following safe harbor method.Under the fractional method, the income for the period between the endof the taxable year and the distribution date that is allocable to electivedeferrals is multiplied by a fraction determined under the method describedin paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section. Under the safe harbor method,the allocable income for the period between the end of the taxable yearand the distribution date is equal to 10 percent of the income allocableto excess deferrals for the taxable year (as calculated under paragraph(d)(5)(ii) of this section) multiplied by the number of calendar monthsthat have elapsed since the end of the taxable year. For purposes of determiningthe number of calendar months that have elapsed under the safe harbor method,a distribution occurring on or before the fifteenth day of the month willbe treated as having been made on the last day of the preceding month,and a distribution occurring after such fifteenth day will be treated ashaving been made on the first day of the next subsequent month.(iv) <T3>Special rule for corrective distributions within taxable year</T3>.In the case of a corrective distribution of excess deferrals describedin paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the income allocable to elective deferralsfrom the beginning of the taxable year to the date on which the distributionis made shall be determined using the method described in paragraph (d)(5)(iii)of this section. (v) <T3>Special rules for taxable years which begin in 1987. </T3>For taxableyears which begin in 1987, plan sponsors may use any reasonable methodfor computing the income allocable to excess deferrals, provided that suchmethod is used consistently for all participants and for all correctivedistributions under a plan for that plan year. The closing balance methodis a reasonable method for this purpose. Under the closing balance method,the income allocable to excess deferrals is equal to the sum of (A) theincome allocable to the account containing the excess deferrals for theapplicable year, and (B) the income allocable to such account for the gapperiod, multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is theexcess deferral and the denominator is the closing balance (as of the endof the applicable year) of the account containing the excess deferral.The closing balance includes income for the applicable year. A method willnot be considered unreasonable if income between the end of the taxableyear and the date of distribution (``gap period'') is not taken into account.(6) <T3>Coordination with distribution or recharacterization of excess contributions.</T3>The amount of excess deferrals that may be distributed under thisparagraph (d) with respect to an employee for a taxable year shall be reducedby any excess contributions previously distributed or recharacterized withrespect to such employee for the plan year beginning with or within suchtaxable year. In the event of a reduction under this paragraph (d)(6),the amount of excess contributions includible in the gross income of theemployee and reported by the employer as a distribution of excess contributionsshall be reduced by the amount of the reduction under this paragraph (d)(6).See andSection; 1.401(k)-1(f)(5)(i). In no case may an individual receivefrom a plan as a corrective distribution for a taxable year under paragraph(d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section an amount in excess of the individual'stotal elective deferrals under the plan for the taxable year.(7) <T3>Other provisions of law. </T3>A corrective distribution of excess deferrals(and income) may be made under the terms of the plan without regard toany notice or consent otherwise required under section 411(a)(11) or 417.(8) <T3>Tax treatment_</T3>(i) <T3>Corrective distribution. </T3>A corrective distribution of excess deferralsdescribed in paragraph (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this paragraph is excludiblefrom the employee's gross income. However, a corrective distribution ofincome allocable to excess deferrals is includible in the employee's grossincome for the taxable year in which the elective deferrals by the employeewould have been received by the employee had he originally elected to receivethe amounts in cash. A corrective distribution of excess deferrals (andincome) under paragraphs (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section is not subjectto the early distribution tax of section 72(t) and is not treated as adistribution for purposes of applying the excise tax under section 4981A.(ii) <T3>Other distributions of excess deferrals. </T3>If excess deferrals (andincome) for a taxable year are not distributed in accordance with paragraphs(d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, such amounts are treated when distributedas elective deferrals (and income) that were excludible from the individual'sgross income under section 402(g). Thus, any amount includible in grossincome for any taxable year under this section which is not distributedby April 15 of the following taxable year shall not be treated as an investmentin the contract for purposes of section 72 and shall be includible in theemployee's gross income when distributed from the plan.(9) <T3>No reduction of required minimum distribution. </T3>A distributionof excess deferrals (and income) under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) ofthis section is not treated as a distribution for purposes of determiningwhether the plan meets the minimum distribution requirements of section401(a)(9).(10) <T3>Partial correction. </T3>Any distribution under paragraphs (d)(2) or(d)(3) of this section of less than the entire amount of excess deferrals(and income) is to be treated as a pro rata distribution of excess deferralsand income.(11) <T3>Examples. </T3>The provisions of this paragraph may be illustratedby the following examples. Assume in Example (1) and (2) that there isno income or loss allocable to the elective deferrals.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Employee <T3>A </T3>is a 60 year old highly compensated employee who participatesin his employer's section 401(k) arrangement. During the period of Januarythrough September of 1988. A contributed $7500 to the arrangement in electivedeferrals. In December of 1988, A made a withdrawal of $1,000 but did notdesignate this as a withdrawal of an excess deferral. In January of 1989,A discovers the excess deferral of $500 for 1988. To correct excess deferrals,A must withdraw an additional $500 even though he has already withdrawn$1,000 for 1988. A may exclude from income in 1988 only $7,000. However,if the $500 is distributed by April 15, 1989, the distribution is excludiblefrom A's gross income. Even if A withdraws the $500, the employer musttake into account the entire $7,500 in computing A's actual deferral percentagefor 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Corporation X maintains a cash or deferred arrangementdescribed in section 401(k). The plan year is the calendar year. For planyear 1989, all ten of X's employees are eligible to participate in theplan.

Employees 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are nonhighlycompensated employees. The actual deferral percentage for the highly compensatedemployees and nonhighly compensated employees are 8.33% and 4.43% respectively.These percentages do not satisfy the requirements of section 401(k)(3)(A)(ii).The actual deferral percentage for the highly compensated employees cannotexceed 6.43%. This was done by reducing the actual deferral percentageof employees 2 and 3 to 7.14 and distributing $2002 ($7000 - .0714 ($70,000))to employees 2 and 3, respectively in January of 1990. Section 401(k)(3)(A)(ii)was therefore satisfied. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In February of 1990, employees 2 informs Corporation X that he madeelective deferrals of $2,000 under a 401(k) plan maintained by an unrelatedemployer in 1989 and requests distribution of $2,000 from the CorporationX plan. However, since employee 2 has already received a distribution of$2,002 to meet the ADP test, no additional amounts can or need be distributedas excess deferrals by this plan. However, the employer must report $2000as a distribution of an excess deferral and $2 as a distribution of anexcess contribution. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>Employee T has excess deferrals of $1,000. The incomeattributable to such deferrals is $100. Employee T properly requests adistribution of the excess deferral (and income) on February 1. The plandistributes $1,000 to the employee by April 15. Because the plan did notdistribute income, $909 is treated as a distribution of excess deferrals,and $91 is treated as a distribution of earnings. With respect to amountsremaining in the account, $91 is treated as an elective deferral, and,because it was not distributed by the required date, will be includiblein gross income upon distribution as well as in the year of deferral. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>Participant A made an elective contribution of $30,000to a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under section 401(k) during1987, resulting in an excess deferral for 1987 of $23,000. A had an openingaccount balance of $80,000. The gain allocable for the calendar year tothe elective contribution account is $15,000. The gain allocable for thegap period, January 1, 1988 to March 1, 1988 (the date of distribution),is $5,000. The 1987 closing elective deferral account balance for A is$125,000, determined as follows: $80,000 opening account balance plus $15,000gain earned through the end of the taxable year plus the $30,000 electivecontribution. Under the closing balance method, the income allocable tothe excess deferral for the 1987 taxable year is $2,760 ($15,000 multipliedby 23,000/125,000). The income for the gap period is $920 ($5,000 multipliedby 23,000/125,000). Thus, under the closing balance method, the incomeallocable to the excess deferral is $3,680 ($2,760 plus 920). The sameresult would be obtained by multiplying the combined income for the applicableyear and gap period ($20,000) by the closing balance method fraction ($23,000/125,000).In either case, the amount of income subject to distribution is $3,680.Thus, the amount of income required to be distributed is $26,680 ($23,000excess plus $3,680 income). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (5). </T3>Assume the facts set forth in Example (4). The electivedeferral account balance for the end of the year is $125,000. Under theadjusted balance method, the denominator of the fraction, $110,000 is computingby subtracting from the account balance ($125,000), the gain allocableto the account, ($15,000). Thus, the income allocable to the excess deferralfor the 1987 taxable year is $3,136.36 ($15,000 income multiplied by 23,000/110,000).For purposes of computing the gap period income under the adjusted balancemethod, the elective deferral account balance on the date of distributionis $130,000 ($125,000 opening balance on January 1, 1988 plus $5,000 earningsthrough the date of distribution). The denominator of the fraction is $125,000($130,000 minus $5,000). The income allocable to the excess deferral forthe gap period under the adjusted balance method is $920 ($5,000 multipliedby 23,000/125,000). Thus, under the adjusted balance method, the totalincome allocable to the excess deferral in this example is $4,056.36 ($3,136.36plus $920).

May qualified nonelective contributions described in section 401(m)(4)(C)be treated as employer contributions for purposes of the minimum contributionor benefit requirement of section 416? A. Yes. This is the case even if the qualified nonelective contributionsare treated as elective contributions under andSection; 1.401(k)-1(b)(2)and (3) or as matching contributions under andSection; 1.401(m)-1(b)(1) and(2). M-19 Q. May matching contributions described in section 401(m)(4)(A) betreated as employer contributions for purposes of the minimum contributionor benefit requirement of section 416? A. Matching contributions allocated to key employees are treated as employercontributions for purposes of determining the minimum contribution or benefitunder section 416. However, if a plan utilizes contributions allocatedto employees other than key employees on the basis of employee contributionsor elective contributions to satisfy the minimum contribution requirement,such contributions are not treated as matching contributions for purposesof applying the requirements of sections 401(k) and 401(m) for plan yearswhich begin after December 31, 1988. Thus, such contributions must meetthe nondiscrimination requirements of section 401(a)(4) without regardto section 401(m). See sesction 401(k)(4)(C) and the regulations thereunder.M-20 Q. May elective contributions be treated as an employer contributionfor purposes of satisfying the minimum contribution or benefit requirementof section 416(c)(2)? A.
