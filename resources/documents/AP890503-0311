The House Banking Committee capped four days of debate byapproving the plan on a 49-2 vote Tuesday minutes before midnight.The Senate had passed its own version of the bill last week.   The legislation provides $157 billion over the next decade, mostof it from taxpayers, to close or merge more than 500 failedinstitutions.   It also would put Sandamp;L regulators under more directadministration control, increase spending to uncover fraud at Sandamp;Lsand, in the key reform, require Sandamp;L owners to risk more of theirown capital when they make loans.   The Bush administration is particularly pleased with the Housebill's capital provisions and is calling for Congress to swiftlycomplete the legislative process and put a finished bill on thepresident's desk.   ``The risk now is delay,'' said Assistant Treasury SecretaryDavid W. Mullins, one of the architects of the Bush plan. The billhas ``gone through so far without major changes. ... If someonewanted to tinker with major components, we would argue that wouldbe unwarranted and very costly.''   In a statement, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady indicated theadministration would be working to modify some provisions of thebill passed by the House Banking Committee before the measureclears Congress.   Brady singled out changes in the administration's proposals forsetting up the Resolution Trust Corp., a new federal agency todispose of repossessed assets of insolvent Sandamp;Ls, including aprovision which would require that some of the property be sold tolow-income people at a discount.   ``We do have serious concerns about the nature and direction ofamendments which reconfigure the Resoution Trust Corp. Thecommittee has made substantial modifications which alter theoriginal design and intent of the administration proposal,'' Bradysaid. ``We are particularly concerned about provisions that woulddivert resources needed for savings and loan resolutions to housingsubsidies.''   Staff aides to the banking committee are expected to take untilthe end of next week to put the panel's bill in proper form andwrite a report accompanying the legislation. Other committees withan interest in parts of the measure would then get a week toproduce alternatives, leaving a slim chance that the full Housewould before Memorial Day.   Administration officials are also happy that both the Senate andHouse, so far, have stuck with Bush's complicated mechanism forkeeping $50 billion in Sandamp;L spending out of the budget deficit.   However, both Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the House Ways andMeans Committee chairman, and Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., thechairman of the Rules Committee, disagree with major provisions ofthe bill.   Rostenkowski, in a speech last month, said he believes the Bushfinancing mechanism wastes about $150 million a year because itinflates the government's borrowing costs.   He's being urged by Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member ofthe banking committee, to pursue the issue by including the Sandamp;Lspending in the budget deficit, but exempting it from the automaticcuts under Gramm-Rudman.   ``If nothing else, Rostenkowski can push it and back off andcollect a few chits from the administration,'' said an industrylobbyist who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``He's got absolutelynothing to lose. It makes him a player on a very important issue.''   Pepper, whose panel governs debate on the House floor, ispushing for looser capital rules, arguing that it is unfair to takeaway accounting breaks given to Sandamp;Ls in the early 1980s in exchangefor their takeover of ailing institutions.   The legislation requires Sandamp;L owners to risk $3 of ``real money''or ``tangible'' capital for every $100 they lend _ double therequirement of the bill passed by the Senate last month. Thecapital would act as a buffer to absorb losses before governmentdeposit insurance kicks in.   Pepper is likely to insist that the full House get a chance toreconsider the capital provisions.</TEXT></DOC>
