If the holes remain localized as neutral atoms where they are created,they will assist the F{sup +} ion to desorb, or assist in the desorptionof Na{sup +} ions. The neutral atoms themselves may also desorb. We usemolecular-dynamics calculations to investigate whether the F{sup +} ionand neutral F atoms produced by the Na K-shell Auger cascade in NaF canin fact lead to the desorption of positive ions and/or neutral F atoms.Simple fits to the Gordon-Kim potentials are used for the ionic interactions.Ab initio two-body potentials are developed to describe the interactionbetween a neutral F atom just outside of the crystal surface and a Naor F ion in the surface plane. The potentials exhibit a repulsive innerwall similar to that found for the diatomic molecules, and a shallowwell. The integration time required for a satisfactory simulation ofpositive-ion desorption by the Knotek-Feibelman mechanism is shown tobe 1--2 ps. Using 2-ps simulations, it is shown that only when the F{sup+} ion is accompanied by four neighboring F atoms from the same Augercascade does positive-ion desorption occur from the perfect (100) surface.Analogous results are obtained in simulations designed to relate to theimperfect (100) surface. It is concluded that the neutral atoms assistpositive ions to desorb only in configurations which appear to be toorare to be of experimental significance. It is shown that crystal temperature,near room temperature, is not a factor in determining whether positive-iondesorption occurs by the Knotek-Feibelman mechanism.</TEXT></DOC>
