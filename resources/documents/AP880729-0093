The labor newspaper Trud said 44 people face criminal charges inYerevan, the Armenian capital, following an incident in whichArmenian activists attached slogans to their cars and drove aroundthe city.   The newspaper did not indicate the date or the size of thedemonstration. It said 155 drivers had their licenses revoked and310 were fined, indicating a sizeable turnout.   The protest involved Aremenians' demand for control ofNagorno-Karabakh, in the republic of Azerbaijan.   Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-dominated area. Most Armeniansare Christians, and most Azerbaijanis are Moslems.   Demonstrations in Yerevan and in Nagorno-Karabakh began inFebruary. This month, Armenian officials voted to annex thedisputed region, but Azerbaijani leaders refused.   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on July 18 deemed thatNagorno-Karabakh should remain part of Azerbaijan. The Presidiumalso ordered local law enforcement agencies to ensure that orderwas restored in the area.   The official Tass news agency reported today that the situationwas stabilizing in Armenia, but it said that at ``the urging ofinstigators,'' some strikes and protests continued.   Tass said party and government leaders in the regions involvedhad been penalized for failing to take appropriate action againstthose organizing the unrest.   It praised the ``vigorous stand'' taken against continuedactivism.</TEXT></DOC>
