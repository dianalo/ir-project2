 Many companies are starting to plan for all of these cablingneeds.andP;  This means big business for companies that install universal orstructure wiring plans.andM;A universal-wiring system is a planned network of cables that gives everyworkstation the ability to tap into all available communication networkseasily and without a major disruption of the workplace.andM;Although there are many cables and connectors in use today, each cablingsystem is comprised of the same basic subsystems.andP;  I like to think of thissystem in terms of the human nervous system.andM;Remember The Fantastic Voyage?andP;  Raquel Welch and Steve Boyd were miniaturizedand put aboard a subcellular ship which was injected into a dying man.andP;  Theirmission: clean his heart valve .andP;  .  .  or something like that (it wasn'tthat memorable).andM;Well, here's our own fantastic voyage through the eight major components of auniversal-wiring system.andM;Equipment rooms, the vertebraeandM;of the system.andM;The equipment room plays a vital role in any structured-wiring plan.andP;  Theserooms provide housing for the main and intermediate-distribution frames aswell as termination points for the riser and horizontal-wiring subsystems.andO;Normally, the equipment rooms are stacked, much like vertebrae in ourbackbone.andM;The main distribution frame,andM;cebrebral ganglia.andM;In our analogy, the brain can be compared to a PBX or a computer's centralprocessing unit (CPU).andP;  But the brain is useless unless connected to thespinal cord.andP;  In a universal-wiring system, the main distribution frame (MDF)provides this vital connection between the PBX and CPU and the risersubsystem.andP;  Think of the cerebral ganglia between the brain and the centralnervous system.andM;The MDF consists of a variety of equipment including termination blocks,patch panels and patch cords.andP;  A cabling vendor should be able to recommendthe equipment which will work best with a particular scheme.andM;The riser subsystem, theandM;spinal cord.andM;The riser or backbone subsystem is essentially the spinal cord of thebuilding.andP;  Different types of cable can be used to move information fromfloor to floor.andP;  The most common risers are twisted-pair or coaxial cables.andO;Fiber optics are also increasingly used for riser applications.andM;In most cases, different riser cables are used in this subsystem to keep thevoice and data networks separate.andP;  This is a precautionary measure taken toprevent data corruption.andM;The intermediate distributionandM;frame.andM;The intermediate distribution frame (IDF) is a secondary-distribution centerin a structured-wiring plan.andP;  These are found in the equipment rooms on eachfloor.andP;  The IDFs provide the cross-connects between the riser subsystem andthe horizontal subsystem.andP;  Any type of LAN can be established at the IDF.andO;This means that employee interruptions are kept to a minimum during theinstallation of the LAN.andM;The horizontal wiring subsystem.andM;Technological advances that let data flow freely over twisted-pair cableshave basically eliminated new installation of coaxial cable to theworkstation.andP;  Horizontal wiring consists of the cables that run between theIDF and the workstation.andP;  All workstations are &quot;star-wired&quot; back to the IDF.andO;Twisted-pair cable is the accepted standard for horizontal wiring -- butfiver optic calbe is invading this province.andM;Twisted pair can be shielded or unshielded.andP;  If unshielded wiring is used,the tpical horizontal cable will consist of two four-pair cables to eachworkstation.andP;  One of these cables will be used for voice transmission and theother for data transmissions.andM;In the shielded environment, two-shielded twisted pairs and four-unshieldedpairs will run to each station.andP;  These can be in one sheath or two separatesheaths.andP;  The shielded cable pairs will be used for data communications andthe unshielded for voice.andM;The terminal subsystem.andM;The terminal equipment includes the wall-mounted outlets and any equipmentneeded to connect the telephone and a computer to those outlets.andP;  The typicalvoice outlet is a six-pin RJ-11-type jack.andM;The data outlet is another question.andP;  Many different outlets are used as datajacks.andP;  The most common are the RJ-11, an eight-pin RJ-45 and thefour-position data connector.andP;  The choice of outlets depens upon the dataapplication desired and the type of cable being used.andM;A connecting cable of some kind is required to connect the telephone andcomputer equipment to the wall outlets.andP;  The jumper cord for the telephone isa standard tie, and is usually supplied by the telephone vendor.andP;  A balun isrequired to attach a computer to the structured-wiring plan.andP;  The balunconverts balanced twisted-pair cable to unbalanced-coaxial cable.andP;  Baluns arebeautiful as well as hot in today's world.andM;The campus subsystem.andM;If multiple buildings need to share common information, the campus subsystemwill play a major role.andP;  This subsystem consists of the cabling used toconnect buildings.andP;  The choice of cable type is the critical issue.andP;  Thecable selected depends upon the type, speed and amount of information to betransferred.andM;Voice grade and low-speed data transmission can use twisted pair.andP;  Higherdata speeds and heavier traffic will run better over coaxial or fiber opticcable.andM;AdministrationandM;The administration of a wiring plan is not part of the cabling itself.andO;However, the long-term effectiveness of the cabling system depends on clearrecord keeping.andP;  In the administration system, every wire is numbered andlabeled.andM;Horizontal cables will be identified differently than riser cables, data runsdifferently than from voice runs.andP;  The MDF and the IDFs will be labeledaccordingly.andP;  This will all make moves and adds much easier.andP;  In fact, inmost cases it will only be necessary to move a wire or two at the IDF or MDF.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
