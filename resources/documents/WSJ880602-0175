Pretax profit increased to 125.47 billion yen ($1 billion) from 78.02 billion yen, while net income rose to 60.71 billion yen from 34.18 billion yen. Sales grew 8%, to 3.572 trillion yen ($28.55 billion) from 3.308 trillion yen.    Last week, Toshiba said that on an unconsolidated, or parent-company, basis, pretax profit rose 58%, net 56% and sales 7.2% in the fiscal year.    In addition to the strong yen, which makes Japanese products more expensive in terms of other currencies, Toshiba was hurt by punitive steps taken against the company in the U.S. because of the discovery that a Toshiba unit had illegally sold militarily sensitive equipment to the Soviet Union. Shipments to the U.S. declined 6.3%, to 300 billion yen.    Sales of electronic devices and communications-information equipment rose 15%, to 1.528 trillion yen, aided by a recovery in the world semiconductor market and steady demand for office-automation equipment, including personal computers and copiers. </TEXT></DOC>
