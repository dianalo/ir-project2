After the Fremont fires, Lann leafleted theneighborhood near the plants, searching for clients.;    In the latter cases,Lann also sent scores of clients to a Fremont doctor a month after the firesand then sent falsified medical reports to show his clients were injured,according to papers filed this week in Alameda County Superior Court inconnection with raids on Lann's Oakland office last week.;    &quot;I've never seenanything like this before,&quot; said James C. Hyde, an attorney for the twoFremont firms, Advanced Dielectrics Inc. and Trend Circuits Inc., which weresued by Lann after fires in May 1989.;    &quot;Although there were 80-plus reports(for alleged victims), there were only three forms and only the names werechanged,&quot; Hyde said. &quot;We called it report versions A, B and C.&quot;;    In a sworndeposition, Dr. Stephen B. Turner said he had examined some of Lann's clientsat the attorney's request but never signed the medical reports Lann's officedelivered to Hyde. Turner said his signature was faked on them.;    Lann, aRussian immigrant admitted to the California bar in 1987, did not return callsWednesday to his Los Angeles office for comment.;    District Attorney'sInspector John Lovelady is investigating Lann for allegedly falsifying themedical reports and for insurance fraud, according to the court documents.;   In addition, Lann is suspected of violating state bar rules of professionalconduct by cashing at an Oakland grocery store checks totaling as much as$400,000 made out to some of the thousands of clients he represents in theSafeway warehouse and Southern Pacific train disasters.;    Attorneys arerequired to set up trust accounts at banks for money they collect on theirclients' behalf, but Lann employees frequently sent checks to the Lake MerrittMarket on Grand Avenue in Oakland, court documents said. Included were checksmade out to his Southern California clients.;    Lovelady stated in his filingthat Lann possibly cashed the checks at the market to make an audit traildifficult to follow or to avoid reporting income to the IRS.;    Lovelady alsosaid that several checks from Southern Pacific cashed by Lann employees hadforged endorsement signatures.;    Attorneys for Safeway and Southern Pacificsaid the two companies have paid off thousands of claims from both disasters-- Safeway's payments alone total more than $35 million to date -- but eachhas received numerous suspect claims from people who were far from the fires.;   Gerald Martin Jr., an attorney for Safeway in Oakland, has sought courtsanctions against Lann for filing suit on behalf of hundreds of childrenwithout also naming guardians for those clients, making the suits impossibleto pursue.;    Southern Pacific's Los Angeles attorney, George Link, said thatLann has filed suit on behalf of nearly 2,800 people in San Bernardino butthat none has been pursued sufficiently yet to evaluate whether they arelegitimate. However, S.P. has made numerous small payments to Lann clients whofiled damage claims shortly after the accident.;    Hyde, the attorney for thetwo Fremont firms, said nearly a third of the 200 plaintiffs in those suitshave already been dismissed. He added the companies have yet to see any reasonto pay damages to the remainder.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BARRY WITT, Mercury News Oakland Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Oakland  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910411  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  641  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday April 11, 199100102022,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
