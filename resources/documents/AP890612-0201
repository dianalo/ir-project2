The Iberian country of 38.8 million people and 196,000 squaremiles has transformed itself into a confident, Western democracysince Generalissimo Francisco Franco's crippling 36-yeardictatorship.   Today, Spain is Europe's star economic performer, eagerlymarching toward 1992, when the Common Market nations' internal tradebarriers are to fall.   But there are signs of economic overheating and a new feeling ofpolitical uncertainty as Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalezfaces challenges from left and right.   Spain's new prosperity isn't felt by all, and there are worriesthat the benefits of its economic transformation _ prosperity,confidence, optimism _ are being accompanied by less favorablechanges. This is prompting some soul-searching questions amongSpaniards about the young democracy's direction.   In the rush to modernize, Spaniards are polluting theirenvironment. Crime, much of it drug-related, is on the rise, and inthe capital women clutch their purses to prevent their snatching.   But overriding the misgivings is a tremendous sense of vitality,what some are calling a gold-rush feeling, as 1992 approaches.   ``In one generation, you had people very scared about what wasgoing to happen to their futures and now I think there is a lot moreoptimism,'' says Jorge Hay, a director of Banco Hispano Americano.   For four years, growth has been spurred by low oil prices, strongglobal economic expansion, agreed low wages, tight money andrestructuring to broaden the economic base. Major industries aretextiles, shoes, agriculture, tourism, cars, ships, machinery andsteel.   ``We have in process an extraordinary acceleration ofmodernization,'' Finance Minister Carlos Solchaga said in a recentspeech. ``The economy really has strong momentum.''   Spain's economy is expected to be Europe's fastest-growing thisyear with a 4.5 percent growth rate, after about 5 percent in thelast two years.   Spain has come a long way from the old stereotype images ofFlamenco dancers and bullfights. Madrid has become a prosperous,almost antiseptic-looking European capital.   The fashion statement in the city today is black. The well-to-doSpanish are a graceful, well-groomed people who like to be admired.The long lunch, which begins after 2 p.m., is an enduring tradition.Menus list an astonishing array of seafood.   Once strongly Catholic, Spain has become increasingly secular.The birth rate has fallen dramatically, to 1.5 children for everywoman from 2.8 in 1975. Divorce was legalized 10 years ago, abortionin 1985. Young couples display a physical affection unheard of underFranco.   Another tradition that endures is the ``macho'' society.   Few women hold positions of any power, and only one-third work,the lowest rate in the Common Market. Families remainmale-dominated, although, incongruously, Spanish women have alwayskept their maiden names and children are given both their parentssurnames.   Spain's 1977 transition from isolationist dictatorship todemocracy was relatively smooth.   Franco, who came into power after the 1936-1939 civil war thatclaimed a million lives, died in 1975. His chosen successor, KingJuan Carlos I, facilitated the creation of a new constitution. Therestored monarch and his family remain highly popular.   The constitution established 17 autonomous Spanish regions, somewith their own language besides the official Castilian. Regionaldifferences are most starkly illustrated by the 21-year Basqueseparatist campaign, which has claimed more than 600 lives.   Confidence in Spain's democracy was bolstered by the failure of a1981 military coup, and Gonzalez was elected in 1982, backed bySpain's most prominent union, the General Workers Union.   Re-elected in 1986, Gonzalez must call the next election by June1990, and not so long ago he seemed invincible. Now many Spaniardsare convinced the former lawyer will win, but that his Socialistparty will lose its parliamentary majority.   The factious right has gotten more organized while 47-year-oldGonzalez has clashed on the left with his main trade union ally,General Workers Union chief Nicolas Redondo. Redondo supports thedrive for growth, but believes the wealth should be more widelyspread.   Gonzalez' determination to dismantle Spain's tradition oflifetime employment is unpopular. His relations with the unionssoured further when the 3 percent inflation forecast used tonegotiate wages agreement turned out to be way off the mark of 5.8percent.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
