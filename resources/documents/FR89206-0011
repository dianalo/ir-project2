The following summarizesthe comments received and the actions we have taken based on these comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>The comments received in response to the proposed rule to offer benefitsfor biofeedback therapy were generally supportive of the decision to expandcoverage to include benefits for biofeedback therapy as proposed. A summaryof the comments and our responses to them are listed below.A. Provider Requirements<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commentors recommended that the requirement forphysician referral be deleted, while other commentors supported this requirement.<T3>Response: </T3>We feel that physician referral is essential for thediagnoses listed as coverable to ensure that a patient be adequately evaluated,diagnosed and treated before initiation of biofeedback therapy.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commentors recommended that the requirement forphysician supervision be deleted or clarified to read as follows ``a physicianmust continue to be involved in the care of and medically responsible forthe patient,'' or ``treatment should be reviewed periodically by a physicianto assure maximum patient benefit.''<T3>Response: </T3>We accept the commentors arguments for deletion andhave deleted this requirement in the final rule.<T3>Comments: </T3>Several commentors recommended that only individualswho have some form of recognized biofeedback certification be approvedas authorized providers of biofeedback services.<T3>Response: </T3>We do not find the arguments for this requirement persuasive.We have determined that those individuals practicing within the scope oftheir licensure and meeting the CHAMPUS criteria of authorized providerare qualified to provide otherwise covered biofeedback therapy.B. Benefits Provided<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commentors objected to the expansion of benefitsto include coverage for biofeedback services since it would result in anincrease in program expenditures.<T3>Response: </T3>While we do agree that the addition of biofeedback asa benefit may initially increase program expenditure, we feel that theinitial increase may be offset to a degree by a decrease in other programareas such as prescription drugs, physical therapy, etc. We feel programexpenditures are further kept to a minimum since cost-sharing is limitedto specific diagnoses, and a maximum yearly limit of 20 sessions.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commentors felt the requirement for documentationthat other forms of conventional treatment have been unsuccessful priorto the initiation of biofeedback therapy was too restrictive and couldeasily be misinterpreted to exclude coverage for biofeedback used in combinationwith other medical treatment modalities. The commentors recommended thisrequirement be clarified to read as follows ``that other forms of conventionaltreatment are or have been insufficient, or their omission in a treatmentprogram can be adequately justified.''<T3>Response: </T3>We agree clarification is needed since it is not ourintent to exclude biofeedback therapy when used as an adjunctive treatmentwith conventional medical treatment. However, considering our list of covereddiagnoses, we do feel that other forms of conventional treatment shouldbe attempted and not omitted prior to the initiation of biofeedback therapy.Therefore, the following compromising language has been included in thefinal rule, ``documentation that their present condition is not respondingto or no longer responds to other forms of conventional treatment.''<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commentors objected to the exclusion of all psychosomaticdisorders on the basis that all diagnoses have psychosomatic aspects and,therefore, would be excluded from coverage.<T3>Response:</T3> We do not agree. The term psychosomatic is defined ashaving bodily symptoms of psychic, emotional, or mental origin. By usingthis term, we are clearly indicating our intent to prohibit cost-sharingof biofeedback therapy as treatment of conditions associated solely withmental or emotional origin.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commentors felt that the list of covered diagnoseswas too limiting and should be expanded.<T3>Response:</T3> We did not find their arguments persuasive. Our benefitdesign allows far more comprehensive coverage than currently offered byother major third party payors.As part of the rulemaking process, CHAMPUS is required by law to consultwith specific government agencies who have categories of beneficiarieseligible to receive CHAMPUS benefits. Comments received from these governmentagencies during this coordination process are given serious considerationin forming the design of the final CHAMPUS rule. During this coordinationon the proposed rule on biofeedback, the Department of Health and HumanServices (DHHS) objected to some of the diagnoses proposed for coverage.Specifically, DHHS felt that biofeedback was safe and efficacious as adjunctivetreatment for Raynauds Syndrome and certain spastic motor conditions. However,they felt that medical literature was not conclusive in establishing theefficacy of biofeedback therapy for vascular and tension headaches andmild hypertension. Additionally, as further clarification, the Office ofHealth Technology Assessment within DHHS indicated that the current Medicarecoverage policy on biofeedback was well supported by medical literature.Wishing to assure safety and efficacy for those CHAMPUS beneficiaries whomay require biofeedback treatment, we have modified the final rule to incorporatethe recommendations of DHHS. Adoption of the current Medicare coveragepolicy and DHHS's recommendations will provide coverage for several ofthe specific conditions listed in the proposed rule (e.g., stroke, fecalincontinence, and torticollis) and will exclude coverage for those conditionsnot supported by medical literature (e.g., vascular and tension headachesand mild hypertension).As stated in the notice of proposed rulemaking andSection;199.4, paragraph(g)(59) Part 199 specifically excludes biofeedback therapy from the CHAMPUSBasic Program. The basis for this exclusion was that this treatment modalitywas primarily experimental and not generally accepted by the professionalmedical community.In the Senate Appropriations Committee Report on the Department of DefenseAppropriations Act for 1979, OCHAMPUS was requested to ``conduct a studyand work with the Biofeedback Society of America (or other appropriaterepresentatives of this clinical technique) to delineate the conditionsunder which biofeedback might be acceptable as a health care service thatcan be reimbursed by CHAMPUS.''Following this directive, OCHAMPUS has numerous meetings with DoD officials,OCHAMPUS personnel, and members of the Biofeedback Society of America.The information obtained at these meetings and the input received fromother professional sources, led OCHAMPUS to propose an amendment to theRegulation in 1980 which allowed limited coverage for biofeedback therapy.However, the proposed amendment was disapproved because of insufficientevidence establishing clinical efficacy for biofeedback services.Each year, since that time, the Senate Appropriations Committee has expressedinterest on OCHAMPUS' progress toward the establishment of limited biofeedbackbenefits. In 1983, OCHAMPUS was directed by Congress to report on whenOCHAMPUS would establish biofeedback therapy as a benefit. Our responseto this Congressional directive indicated that before OCHAMPUS could establishbenefits for limited biofeedback therapy further examination of cost-savingswas required. Additionally, we reported that we could only support theestablishment of biofeedback services when there was clear evidence thatit would not increase program costs. Our report further offered a solutionof initiating a demonstration project to determine both clinical and cost-effectivenessof biofeedback services. Following this report, The Senate AppropriationsCommittee Report No. 98-636 of the DoD Appropriations Act of 1985, expressedan interest in being apprised of the results of the OCHAMPUS biofeedbackdemonstration project.Acting on the expressed interest of The Senate Appropriations CommitteeReport, OCHAMPUS determined that an evaluation study of biofeedback byan independent contractor was needed as the first step in designing andimplementing a demonstration project. In 1985, a competitive contract wasawarded to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of biofeedbacktherapy and provide recommendations for policy options.The results of the evaluation study indicated that biofeedback literaturenow supports the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of biofeedback therapyfor treatment of fecal incontinence, Raynaud's syndrome, hypertension,chronic migraine, and tension headaches and neuromuscular rehabilitationunder certain conditions.The recommendations for CHAMPUS demonstration benefit policy options were:To provide coverage as a primary modality for fecal incontinence; to providecoverage as an adjunct modality for Raynaud's syndrome, hypertension, chronicmigraine and tension headaches with coverage limitations on the numberof visits and costs per visit and treatment for specific diagnosis. Additionally,coverage should be only for treatment administered by or under the supervisionof a physician or prescribed by one. The study recommended that the demonstrationtest location and control location match as closely as possible with respectto medical care available from a Military Treatment Facility, CHAMPUS-eligiblepopulation demographics, and medical doctor-to-certified therapist ratio.The study further reported that the demand for biofeedback services couldnot be determined because no biofeedback patient demographic, utilizationand cost data were available. As a result, no reliable analysis of coverageoptions was possible.Following a review of the evaluation study and all available research material,OCHAMPUS has decided not to initiate a demonstration project, since thereis sufficient information which supports biofeedback as an effective treatmentmodality recognized by the medical community as the standard of care forcertain medical conditions. Additionally, we feel the cost involved inthe implementation and evaluation of a biofeedback demonstration projectcan better be applied to establishing biofeedback therapy as a benefit.Our final rule incorporates the recommendations contained in the evaluationstudy on benefit options, public comments, and follows Medicare's currentcoverage policy including their exclusion of biofeedback treatment forpsychosomatic disorders. Coverage is limited to the treatment of specificmedical conditions for which biofeedback is found to be beneficial andcost-effective.This final amendment offers coverage for services now specifically excludedfrom CHAMPUS cost-sharing. It is an enhancement of military benefits.Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354)requires that each federal agency prepare and make available for publiccomment, a regulatory flexibility analysis when the agency issues regulationswhich would have a significant impact on a substantial number of smallentities. The Secretary certifies, pursuant to section 605(b) of Title5, United States Code, enacted by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.L. 96-354), that this regulation amendment will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small businesses, organizations,or government jurisdictions. The final rule is expected to have the impactof enhancing the scope of CHAMPUS benefits for biofeedback services. Itwill not involve any significant burden on OCHAMPUS beneficiaries or providersof biofeedback services. It is not therefore, a ``major rule'' under ExecutiveOrder 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 199</ITAG>Claims, Handicapped, Health insurance, Military personnel.Accordingly, 32 CFR Part 199 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 199_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
