Seeing himapproach, big stick in hand, they groan and try to scootaway.</LP><TEXT>   There is no escape. Fortunately for the furry creatures,Dr. Testa is interested in seal science, not seal skins.Today he's after urine samples, using a metal tube attachedto a stick. Soon he plans to bar-code the animals,supermarket-style, with plastic tags on their flippers.   Dr. Testa, a bearded University of Alaska biologist, istrying to learn why so many Antarctic seals starve every fewyears. Maybe El Nino, an Equatorial storm system, altersAntarctic currents, he muses, carrying the silverfish thatthe seals feast on out of reach. &quot;There's no mechanism thatcan account for this,&quot; he says.   What drives Dr. Testa and hundreds of other researchers toAntarctica each year is the hope of discovering a hiddentruth about the planet. It's a unique laboratory.   Antarctic science is science of the extremes. A continentbigger than America, covered in ice more than a mile thick,Antarctica is isolated by winds and currents that make it thecoldest, driest place on Earth. It is where scientistsdiscovered the ozone hole over the Earth in 1985, and wherethey now hunt for clues to everything from global warming tocosmic rays.   This is the story of three groups of scientific sleuths inAntarctica: biologists studying the antifreeze systems offish; glaciologists examining whether the West Antarctic icesheet will break apart and flood the world; and cosmologistssearching for the birth of galaxies.                                                                                                          A Fish Story                                                                                                          If it's so cold in Antarctica, why don't the fish freeze?   Arthur DeVries has wondered why since his first visit herein 1961. Seawater under the Ross Ice Shelf ranges from 28degrees to 29.5 degrees -- cold enough to freeze most fish ashard as Mrs. Pauls's. (The water doesn't freeze at 32 degreesbecause salt and pressure lowers its freezing point.) Thefish he hooked beneath the ice swam contentedly in tanksfilled with frigid water, but died when the water was warmed.He had found his life's work.   Over the next seven years the biologist returnedrepeatedly to Antarctica. He experimented with a family ofugly gray and brown fish, called &quot;notothenioidei,&quot; thatthrive in the waters here. After dissecting hundreds of themand analyzing their blood, he learned they produce anantifreeze molecule that lowers their freezing point justenough to survive. &quot;They live at the edge of freezing,&quot; hesays.   Now 52, with a graying walrus mustache and walrus girth,Dr. DeVries is one of the last of the old Antarctic handsstill conducting research &quot;on the ice,&quot; as the place iscalled here.   Dr. DeVries became a pioneer in cryobiology -- the studyof the effects of extremely low temperatures on livingthings. He and his colleagues found a half-dozen differentfish that produce antifreeze. A former grad student, JackDuman of Notre Dame, found antifreeze proteins in Midwesternbeetles, spiders and dandelions. Cryobiologists dream ofusing antifreeze to preserve hearts for transplants, ormaking freeze-resistant orange groves.   Among the results of Dr. DeVries's yearly three-monthstints here are two divorces. His third wife, biologist ChrisCheng, collaborates with him at their base at the Universityof Illinois, trying to isolate the fish gene that makesantifreeze proteins.   Dr. DeVries calculates that fish antifreeze is 200 timesmore effective than an equal amount of Prestone, but he can'tfigure out why. Somehow, the antifreeze binds to tiny icecrystals that the fish swallow as they swim.   One sunny afternoon in November, Dr. DeVries and JosephEastman, a longtime associate who teaches at Miami Universityin Ohio, fish through a hole in the ice. That night, theydissect a few dozen small &quot;notothenioidei&quot; and place theirorgans in test tubes filled with seawater. They want to seeif ice collects in fish organs, and if it does, how theorgans and antifreeze keep the ice in check.   The next afternoon at McMurdo's aquarium, a blue metalshack with six big holding tanks, Dr. DeVries takes a smallfish and puts it in a bath chilled to 19 degrees -- wellbelow the temperature fish antifreeze works at. The fishconvulses, then stiffens, its eyes turn gray with ice. Theice inside the fish had grown explosively at the lowertemperature, Dr. DeVries explains, wrecking the fish'snervous system and cells.   He repeats the test with each fish organ. The heart, &quot;Noice,&quot; he tells a young scientist taking notes. &quot;Liver, noice. Ovaries, no ice. Blood, no ice.&quot; Finally, he dips a testtube with a red spleen into the bath. It quickly becomesencased in ice. The ice collector is found.   But so is a new mystery. Ice buildup should overload thespleen and kill the fish, he says, but it doesn't. Hespeculates there may be a kind of &quot;hot spot&quot; in the fish,that melts ice crystals. &quot;There's still so much to do,&quot; hesighs.   Meanwhile, Canadian scientists are trying to breed salmonwith antifreeze genes so the fish can flourish in the icywaters off Nova Scotia. DNA Plant Technology Corp. inCinnaminson, N.J., is testing tomatoes implanted withantifreeze genes to see if they better withstand freezing andthawing. General Foods has experimented with fish antifreezeto see if it can prevent ice crystals from ruining ice creamthat's left out of the freezer and put back melted.   But none of the research has panned out yet, and Dr.DeVries is deeply skeptical it will until scientistsunderstand better how fish and their antifreeze work.                                                                                                          The Great Flood Watch                                                                                                          Robert Bindschadler sits in his dorm room at McMurdo -- aplace with the charm of a trailer park. He's staring atsatellite photos that may foretell the fate of hundreds ofmillions of people.   The photos don't look dramatic. Just a field of ice markedby ripples and bumps, revealing crevasses and shifting ice.The markings also show the immense forces of nature shapingAntarctica.   Four groups of glaciologists are setting up camp in WestAntarctica to see whether the ice sheet there -- a hunk ofice as big as Greenland -- is beginning to collapse. If so,sea level would rise so quickly that, within decades, somecoastal areas would lose 10 feet of shoreline a year. &quot;Then,it's curtains for Bangladesh,&quot; says Ohio State glaciologist,Ian Whillans.   Dr. Bindschadler, a National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration glaciologist, points to tracks on his photosthat mark the mouth of two huge streams, 30 miles wide, ofsolid ice. He plans to drive stakes into the ice along a90-mile line just below the mouth, and come back two yearslater to see how far the stakes have moved. Some ice streamsmove a half mile a year, pulling ice from Antarctica'sinterior to the sea. There it breaks into icebergs.   By comparing the outflow of ice with measurements of snowaccumulation in the interior, scientists can calculatewhether the ice sheet is shedding ice. If so, they warn, acataclysmic cycle may be underway. The thinner the ice sheetgets, the faster the ice streams will flow. And the fasterthe ice streams flow, the thinner the ice sheet gets, until,eventually, it collapses. Then, &quot;prepare for the worst,&quot; saysDr. Bindschadler.   Just 20 years ago, the threat of a great flood from amelting Antarctica was the stuff of supermarket tabloids. Butafter experiments on two ice streams in the mid-1980s, evenformer skeptics began taking the threat seriously. Scientistsfound that the streams changed speed and direction rapidly --showing the ice sheet as far more unpredictable thanimagined. And they found 500,000-year-old marine fossilsunder the ice, indicating the ice sheet had melted beforewhen the Earth had warmed.   If the ice sheet is melting, humans probably aren't toblame. Glaciologists say Antarctica is responding to thelong-term warming of the Earth since the last ice age 18,000years ago, and to the weird geology of the frozen continent.   For the most part, the half-mile thick ice sheets slidealong a layer of mud. But occasionally the ice stream rollsover a patch of dry rock -- a &quot;sticky spot,&quot; says theUniversity of Wisconsin's Charles Bentley. That stops the icecold. Dr. Bentley figures that one ice stream he has studiedhasn't moved much since it hit a sticky spot during the CivilWar.   This year, Dr. Bentley will hunt for sticky spots usingradar. He and his team plan to lay out 10 rectangular grids,each consisting of 1,000 bamboo poles jammed into the snowatop an ice stream. Then they will use a big tracked vehicleto lug a radar antenna up and down the grid, looking forradar patterns that signal a hard surface below.   &quot;Things are changing rapidly, and we don't have ways topredict the future&quot; of the ice sheet, Dr. Bentley says.Hidden in the snows of Antarctica are some clues.                                                                                                          A Cosmic Quest                                                                                                          Just how cold is it at the South Pole?   -- So cold they put heaters in walk-in refrigerators tokeep beer from freezing.   -- So cold that most all the water vapor freezes, makingthe Polar atmosphere drier than the Sahara's.   The latter explains why two groups of cosmologists havecome to the South Pole in November -- springtime inAntarctica -- when temperatures warm to 50 degrees below zeroand 30-mile-per hour winds blow. This is the best place onEarth for studying the heavens, they explain, because thedrier the air, the better their telescopes can see the cosmicradiation that bathes the planet.   Scientists believe the radiation was produced about500,000 years after the birth of the universe and is the keyto understanding the central paradox of cosmology. If the BigBang sent energy and matter hurtling outward uniformly in alldirections, how did stuff ever clump together, throughgravity, to form the galaxies and stars we see today?Somewhere in the sky, the cosmic radiation must either bemore intense or hotter than other places -- marking siteswhere galaxies formed.   &quot;Otherwise it's all magic,&quot; says George Smoot. Dr. Smoot,a 45-year-old blithe spirit from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratoryin California, leads a team of scientists from the West Coastand Italy. Jeffrey Peterson, 36, leads the other team, fromPrinceton University and several East Coast labs. The teamthat finds the signal in the cosmic radiation that showsgalaxy formation -- or proves that a signal doesn't exist --will have found the Holy Grail of cosmology.   The Princeton team has come to the Pole every other yearsince 1986. Every trip has brought calamity. The first yearthey ran out of liquid helium to cool the telescope. In 1988,their telescope broke as often as an old Ford. In 1990, theyran out of liquid nitrogen, another coolant; this was theonly year they got any useful data, but just about half ofwhat they wanted. In 1991, a new government storage tank ofliquid nitrogen was supposed to supply the team, but onenight it exploded, shattering in two.   The Berkeley team is having better luck. In 1989, theteam's telescope found an energy source powerful enough,perhaps, to account for the birth of galaxies -- and nowthey're back to make sure their measurements weren'tmistaken. Antarctica, they say, is Earth's clearest window tothe cosmos.</TEXT></DOC>
