In a letter to Waste Management's chairman, Dean Buntrock, ChemLawn also again told Waste Management that it must sign a confidentiality accord and agree to other conditions to get access to ChemLawn internal data now being circulated among other potential suitors. As previously reported, Waste Management had objected to those conditions, saying they force Waste Management to drop its current offer and enter a standstill period.    Waste Management, an Oak Brook, Ill.-based hauler of wastes, has offered $27 a share for ChemLawn's 10 million shares. ChemLawn, a lawn care concern, rejected that offer and is holding talks with other possible buyers. In its letter to Mr. Buntrock, ChemLawn set Wednesday as the deadline for any bids.    Waste Management couldn't be reached to comment on ChemLawn's actions. In national over-the-counter trading Friday, ChemLawn shares closed at $32.50 a share, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
