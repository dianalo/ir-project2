In an isolated case of loyalty to a commander, troops in thenorthern port city of St. Marc killed a 12-year-old boy ednesdaywhen they fired into a mob about to attack the home of a sergeantwith a reputation for brutality, witnesses said.   Rank-and-file soldiers in at least 16 military units throughoutthe country have revolted against their commanders since oustingand exiling Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in a weekend coup and naming Lt.Gen. Prosper Avril president.   Avril tried unsuccessfully to quell the uprising on Tuesday bynaming a new armed forces chief and retiring nine unpopularcommanding officers.   ``The situation is precarious. After all, we are in the midst ofa general mutiny,'' one Western diplomat said Wednesday, speakingon condition of anonymity.   In the capital of Port-au-Prince, a leftist coalition called fora popular show of support today for the mutineers. TheConfederation of Democratic Unity urged people to meet outside theSt. Jean Bosco Roman Catholic Church, where 13 worshipers werekilled and 77 wounded by thugs attacking with guns, pikes andmachetes during a Mass six days before the coup.   The demonstration was previously scheduled for Wednesday andconfederation leaders had suspended it, saying they would meetinstead with the leader of the military rebellion, Sgt. JosephHeubreux, and Avril.   There was no confirmation the meeting was held.   A mob on Wednesday placed the smoldering body of a TontonMacoute killed the previous day at St. Bosco's, where severalhundred people gathered.   The Macoutes were the private army of the regime created byFrancois Duvalier that ruled this impoverished nation for 29 yearsuntil mass protests forced his son, Jean-Claude, into exile inFrance in February 1986.   Namphy then headed a junta that promised a transition todemocracy. However, independently run general elections Nov. 29were thwarted when armed thugs supported by soldiers killed atleast 33 people at polling stations.   Leslie Manigat, a civilian, was elected president in January inmilitary-run balloting that was boycotted by leading presidentialcandidates amd marred by widespread irregularities. Namphy oustedhim in June.   Radio stations estimated Wednesday that up to 12 Tonton Macouteshad been killed by mobs and soldiers since Sunday.   Rebellious soldiers rounded up agents of Namphy's Bureau ofCriminal Investigations Wednesday and dumped them _ some inhandcuffs _ at army headquarters in Port-au-Prince. About 200people gathered and cheered each jeepload of soldiers with theircaptives.   The fate of the ousted military commanders dropped off there wasunknown.   At least 11 commanders have been ousted since Monday. Theyinclude former Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Williams Regala,despised in Haiti for his ties to the Duvalier dictatorship.   When they began their mutiny, the enlisted men led by Heubreuxand other members of the Presidential Guard presented the army highcommand with a list of demands that included calls for Haiti'sfirst free elections in 31 years and for major changes in themilitary.   When the high command hesitated, soldiers took matters in theirown hands, ousting their commanders all over the Carribean countryof about 5 million people.   ``The demands of the mutineers have been accepted; it has becomea people's army, at least for the moment,'' said a Westerndiplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   Only pockets of soldiers have openly resisted.   In St. Marc, some 60 miles north of the capital, troops loyal toCapt. Ernst Ravix, accused by townspeople of corruption andbrutality, put down popular demonstrations Wednesday, killing the12-year-old, Nilo Chailes, and wounding three people, witnessessaid.   The soldiers later went to a local jail, freed severalprisoners, and marched triumphantly through the city of 15,000 topopular acclaim. But the crowd was not fully placated and latershouted at Ravix: ``Macoute, Macoute!''   Radio Inter reported Wednesday that mutineers battled othertroops, with one soldier dead in a clash Tuesday in Jacmel, about45 miles south of Port-au-Prince.   On Tuesday, workers at government companies struck to unseatstate-appointed managers in other action apparently aimed at wipingout remnants of Namphy's rule.</TEXT></DOC>
