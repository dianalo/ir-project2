Alar makes apples redder and keeps them crisp longer but issuspected of causing cancer. Government and private officials havesaid only about 5 percent of the nation's apple crop is treated withalar.   Reacting to a report by the private National Resources DefenseCouncil about Alar-treated apples, some school districts temporarilypulled apples from their menus. Federal health officials havedefended the nation's apple supply.   Kevin Gill, head of nutrition for New York City public schools,banned all apple products from public school menus Feb. 2.   ``I'm responsible for 700,000 meals a day. That was anappropriate action for me,'' Gill said Tuesday.   He said apple products will be available next week when schoolsreopen after spring break, with growers agreeing to provide acerificate assuring that they did not use Alar. In addition, Gillsaid, he will send apples for Alar testing periodically.   In Chicago, Board of Education spokesman Bob Saigh said appleswill be back in that city's schools Wednesday.   ``Tests by an outside lab confirmed Alar was not present,'' hesaid.   Saigh said the school system normally uses about 300,000 apples aweek.   He said the school board's action, which took effect March 13,was ``precautionary,'' and that no Alar had been found.   He also added that if the school system gets any new sources ofapples or other foods, testing will be done.   The manufacturer of the chemical, Uniroyal Chemical Co. ofMiddlebury, Conn., has repeatedly cited research showing Alar in theconcentrations found in apples doesn't pose a cancer threat.</TEXT></DOC>
