Also Tuesday, the army announced it had broken up a ring ofMoslem fundamentalists believed responsible for the slayings of twoIsraeli soldiers.   A Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israeli authoritieswas found stabbed to death in the West Bank city of Nablus. AnotherPalestinian died in apparent infighting between militant groups inthe West Bank.   An army communique meanwhile reported an air raid Tuesday ontargets of the Shiite Moslem guerrilla group Hezbollah in MazraatAyn Busiwar, 14 miles inside Lebanon. ``All targets were hit and ourplanes returned safely,'' it said.   Reporters in Nabatiyeh, Lebanon, said at least two Israelihelicopter gunships were involved.   The communique said nothing of casualties or damage. Insoutheastern Lebanon, a police spokesman said no casualty count wasavailable.   Israel gave no reason for the raid, but military officials haveaccused Hezbollah guerrillas of trying to infiltrate Israel and oftaking part in attacks in the border area.   The 13-year-old boy was killed by a rubber bullet afterparamilitary Border Police fired in Qalqilya to stop rioting, thearmy said.   Residents identified him as Mowaeya Haj Hassan and said at leastthree other Palestinians were wounded.   Witnesses said trouble began when hundreds of Qalqilya residents,many of them children, tried to march to the home of Hassan'scousin, who was shot and killed by soldiers a day earlier whiletrying to escape to Jordan.   The army said 10 Qalqilya youths were arrested and that some woremasks.   At a nearby army base, an Israeli soldier was fatally woundedwhen a fellow trooper's pistol accidentally discharged, an armyspokesman said. He said the accident occurred as soldiers of theGolani infantry brigade were examining their weapons prior to apatrol in the West Bank.   At least 612 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis since theuprising against occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip began 23months ago. In addition, 142 Palestinians have been killed by fellowPalestinians, most for allegedly collaborating with Israeliauthorities. Forty Israelis have died.   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said the national policecommissioner, David Kraus, was reviewing a recommendation that sixpolice officers be fired in connection with the death of an18-year-old Palestinian last month.   An inquiry was launched after Israeli newspapers quoted Arabwitnesses as saying Karim Daamseh of Bethlehem was fatally shot Oct.26 and did not die during a car chase, as the police claimed.   The officers' commander recommended a criminal investigation,Israel radio reported. It said preliminary findings indicated thepolicemen allegedly fabricated evidence and gave false testimony.   In the Gaza Strip, the army said security forces uncovered a ringof Moslem extremists connected with the fundamentalist Hamasorganization and arrested several. It said three Hamas membersbelieved involved in the abduction and slayings of two Israeliofficers were not caught.   The body of one of the missing soldiers, 18-year-old Ilan Saadon,was never found, but an army statement said that duringinterrogation, the detainees' yielded concrete evidence he was dead.Saadon was last seen May 3 hitchhiking.   The suspects are also believed involved in the Feb. 16 kidnappingand slaying of 21-year-old soldier Avi Sassportas, who disappearedwhile hitchhiking home. His body was found May 7 in a grove near theGaza Strip.   In Nablus, the body of 28-year-old Nabil Samhan was discovered.He had been stabbed, and Arab reporters said he was suspected ofcollaborating with Israeli officials.   A 24-year-old Palestinian identified as Hamed Mahmoud Abdullahwas attacked by masked Arabs in the village of Safa near the WestBank town of Ramallah.   The national Itim news agency said the killing appeared to be theresult of a dispute between Palestinian factions.</TEXT></DOC>
