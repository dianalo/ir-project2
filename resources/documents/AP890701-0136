(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A huge cargo planethat arose from the Antarctic ice like a frozen phoenix after beingburied in drifts for 16 years returned to its home base Saturday.   ``Today we are celebrating a triumph: a triumph of technology, atriumph of knowledge and skill, and a triumph of courage,'' NationalScience Foundation spokesman Jack Talmadge said after the LC-130Hercules and its nine-member crew landed.   Lockheed engineers and Navy personnel worked in subfreezing cold,heavy snow and windstorms for 42 days to excavate the icebound,40-ton aircraft. The 98-foot-long plane was flown out of the crashsite in January 1988 and was renovated in Christchurch, New Zealand.   The LC-130 returned to its hangar at the Navy's AntarcticDevelopment Squadron 6, the ``Puckered Penguins'' who fly sevencargo ships owned by the foundation and used to supply its polarmissions.   The Hercules was abandoned in December 1971 at a remote siteabout 700 miles from McMurdo Sound, the U.S. ice station on theAntarctic, after an aborted takeoff that damaged its landing ski andnose.   The aircraft was designed for use in polar climates and hasone-ton, Teflon-coated ``wheel-skis'' to break the grip of ice ontakeoff.   The loss of the Hercules hurt the foundation's ability to conductfield research in Antarctica, foundation officials have said.   A salvage crew worked in minus 30-degree temperatures, heavy snowand 20-knot windstorms to excavate the damaged aircraft, repair itand fly it out. All but the top 3 feet of the plane's 38-foot-hightail had been buried in snow.   The plane was made by Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. inMarietta, Ga. Lockheed engineers involved in the salvage found manyhydraulic and electronics systems still working after the longhibernation.   There was still air in the tires and gasoline in the tanks,apparently preserved by the frigid temperatures and dry polarclimate.   Foundation officials say about $4.2 million was spent to excavateand overhaul the plane. The estimated cost of a replacement plane is$35 million.</TEXT></DOC>
