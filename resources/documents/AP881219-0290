The latest virus was not dangerous and was spotted after onlyabout 400 copies of the software had been shipped, but ithighlighted again the vulnerability of software producers to viruses.   ``This is widespread. This is affecting the biggest names insoftware publishing you can think of right now, across the board,''said Dr. Bruce Tizes, a director and owner of MacGuide magazine inLakewood, Colo.   A virus is a fragment of computer code that attaches itself toother programs and spreads through a computer system. Some can wipeout or alter information, while others such as the so-called nVIRvirus cause no serious harm.   The first known case of packaged software being secretlycorrupted was in early 1987 in Freehand, a program from Aldus Corp.of Seattle. The hidden program flashed a message on the screenconveying a ``universal message of peace'' but did not cause anyharm.   The latest virus, a strain of nVIR, was found in seven programson a compact disk from Quantum Leap Technology Inc., of CoralGables, Fla. The virus was detected with special virus screeningprograms.   The disk is the second edition of a CD Rom called MegaROM that isfor Apple Macintosh computers. The virus infected the disk _ a typeof compact disk used to store computer data _ when it was beingprepared for duplication at Nimbus Records in Charlottesville, Va.,according to John Sands, technical operations manager of the CD Romdivision of Nimbus Records.   Sands said the virus came from a piece of software residing on ahard disk drive for Macintosh computers that was manufactured by CMSEnhancements Inc. of Tustin, Calif. He faulted CMS for not alertingits disk drive customers, such as Nimbus, about the virus threat.   CMS President Jim Farooque said in an interview Monday that hehad not been able to verify that the virus had come from hiscompany. He conceded some of his employees had told people at Nimbuspreviously that the virus had come on a CMS floppy disk used toprepare the hard disk for receiving data. But he said, ``It'spossible that ... they are communicating back and forth informationthat may or may not be true.''   Farooque said the company voluntarily was helping people get ridof the viruses without admitting responsibility for them.   Quantum Leap was alerted to the virus on Dec. 9 and beganalerting recipients of the infected MegaRom disks last week,according to the president, Robert Burr. The infected disks areimprinted with a green decorative pattern. Sands said new disks thatare virus-free and have a blue pattern are being shipped out asreplacements.   Almost half of the infected disks were shipped to members of thecomputer press for review. The disks are filled with programs, knownas shareware or freeware, that are available for free from placessuch as computer bulletin boards.   Computer viruses are far more widespread in commerciallyavailable software than is generally realized, Tizes said. He saidMacGuide was assembling demonstration software from major publishersfor its own CD Rom disk and found seven strains of the nVIR virus inprograms from seven major publishers.   ``Invariably the companies didn't know'' about the viruses whenhe alerted them, said Tizes, a medical doctor. He said one hadalready made a recall of the infected disks, which had been shippedout to pilot customers.</TEXT></DOC>
