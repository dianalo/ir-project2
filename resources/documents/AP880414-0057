Several years ago, Korumburra decided to promote theinvertebrate, which has 16 hearts and is a hermaphrodite, meaningit is both male and female.   The great Gippsland gurgling earthworm is so named because ofthe sucking and gurgling noises it makes when it burrows, soundinglike a bathtub draining water. Townsfolk credit the earthworm,whose scientific name is megascolides australis, for helping turntheir fortunes around.   An annual worm festival called Karmai, after the aboriginal wordfor giant earthworm, is held each March. It celebrates the wormwith parades, carnivals and even an earthworm queen.   Recently, however, intensive farming in the worm's small habitathas raised fears the worms' days are numbered.   Korumburra is in Gippsland, an area of the southeast state ofVictoria that once was covered by a rain forest where the wormsthrived. Today, that habitat has been reduced to an area of 100square miles around the Bass River.   Settlers, who thought the worms were snakes, cleared Gippsland'srain forest with its 300-foot trees in the 1880s to make room fordairy farming and cattle raising.   Although not officially protected, the earthworm is now listedas endangered, according to worm expert Georgina Hickey of theAustralian Museum.   Federal Environment Minister Graham Richardson announced an$11,000 save-the-worm grant last week as part of a $383,000 packageto study other threatened species in Victoria, such as the koalabear and the fairy penguin. Korumburra began exploiting theearthworm as a tourist attraction in 1977 after the local coal minewent bust, a butter plant shut down and young people began headingto Melbourne, 75 miles away, in search of jobs.   ``The worm saved the town,'' said Mark Holmes, on whose propertymost of the worms are found. ``The worms helped people have anidentity. I don't know if they're proud of what they've got butwe've got something unique. We've got a thing that is dropping offthe face of the earth.''   Promoting the giant worms wasn't easy, local tourist officalJudith Nicholl admits. ``Of all things in the world, how do youpromote a worm?'' she told a recent visitor. ``It started out as afun thing but now it's very serious. Now when visitors arrive thefirst thing they ask is `Where is the worm?'''   Visitors now flock to Korumburra, population 2,800. The town'sshops display fluffy toy worms and cute cutouts on windows, coloredpink because brown, the worm's natural color, isn't attractive.   Festivities climax with a 100-foot fake worm resembling aChinese dragon that is hoisted and weaved through main street by 60or 70 children.   A nocturnal animal, the worms are difficult to dig up andresidents discourage the practice because the worms can break apartand bleed to death when yanked from the rich clay on which theythrive.   Townsfolk proclaim the worm as the world's largest, althoughlong worms are found elsewhere in the world.   Despite their fame, the local worms remain underground. There isno worm museum in Korumburra or even a display. However,entrepreneurs John Matthews and Tony Zoanetti opened a wormattraction at Bass, 25 miles down the highway toward the PhillipIsland penguin reserve, a major tourist attraction.   There, visitors enter a 300-foot-long building shaped like anearthworm and can walk through a section that simulates theinternal view of the worm's stomach, complete with gurgling noises.   Visitors also experience a worm's eye view of its world belowground. With a $3 entry fee for adults, up to 1,000 people visitthe attraction daily.</TEXT></DOC>
