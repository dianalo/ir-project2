 The truth isthat as more computing power is placed on a talented engineer's desk top, themore likely it is that the engineer can quickly help produce a product thatkeeps his or her company steps ahead of the competition.andM;Keen international competition now means that carving months or even a fewweeks from the product-development cycle can mean the difference between aproduct's success or failure.andP;  Gone are the days when corporations werewilling to spend time rather than money on a project.andP;  Today corporations arelooking to purchase almost anything that will help them save time.andP;  Theworkstation's contribution in rushing a new product to market or in meetingcontracted deadlines is easily quantified.andM;The first lightning rod is usually some interaction from the chief executive.andO;If a company begins to fall behind its competition, it will not take long forthe average chief executive officer to start asking why.andP;  These days, theanswer that often comes back is &quot;technology&quot;--the hot competition isemploying some edge to help it grab market share.andP;  More and more often, thatedge involves innovative uses of workstations and distributed computing inmanufacturing or customer service.andM;Therefore, as most information system managers already know, it is no longersufficient for them to play the role of system resource guardians through theday-to-day maintenance of systems.andP;  Rather, the information system managermust now take a pro-active stance in order to be recognized as the protectorof the company's competitive edge through the better exploitation of existinginformation systems technologies and the efficient adoption of evolvingtechnologies.andM;To be prepared to respond to that beat--or even better yet, to force thecompetition to respond--system managers have to convince the corporatefinancial powers to make the capital outlay required to build a distributedcomputing environment.andP;  These managers should be able to promise a largereturn on that investment through faster delivery of better products.andM;The simplest payback schemes involve trade-offs between cost and end-userproductivity gains.andP;  The Internal Revenue Service still considers five yearsthe useful life of capital equipment, but workstation buyers have a morerealistic outlook.andP;  Among those VAX users polled by Digital Review who hadbought workstations in the past 12 months, the probability that they wouldupgrade their workstations within three years was 75 percent.andP;  (See DigitalReview Strategies Poll, page 42.)andM;Taking an entry-level workstation at a cost of $10,000 and depreciating itover a three-year period, the cost of the workstation is just $12.82 perbusiness day.andP;  Over five years, that cost is $7.69 per business day.andP;  If thatworkstation saves an engineer just 25 minutes a day over three years, theengineer earns a base wage of $24 per hour and the corporation places a 50percent burden rate on salaries for administrative overhead, then theworkstation pays for itself.andP;  Looked at another way, the threshold needed tobreak even amounts to just a 5 percent productivity boost0--a very modesttarget.andM;Nonetheless, such cost reductions resulting from productivity increases onlygraze the surface.andP;  It's the impact that workstations have on design cyclesthat is really important.andP;  Whereas most information system managers recognizethe direct cost savings that occur when a product is introduced to the marketsix months early, many overlook a much more important source of revenues.andO;This is the ongoing additional revenues stream that is created by bringing aproduct to market early and that continues to build on market share throughthe life cycle of the product.andP;  (See &quot;Impact of Early Product Introduction onRevenues.&quot;)andM;This revenues stream dwarfs the associated direct cost savings and frequentlyis neglected by first-time workstation buyers.andP;  In fact, the recognition ofthis benefit was one of the key distinguishing facets between repeat buyersand first-time buyers.andP;  (See Poll, page 42.)andP;  Among new workstation buyers, only 36.8 percent said they would benefit by having shorter product designcycles, and fully 26.3 percent said they would not achieve such benefits.andP;  Onthe other hand, a resounding 66.7 percent of previous workstation buyersanticipated benefits from shorter design cycles, whereas only 13.6 percentexpressed any negative sentiments.andM;Fortunately for those about to make their first workstation acquisition,workstations already exist within many companies in great abundance, andthere are numerous cases in which workstations have helped to provide asignificant edge in bringing products to market early and reducing costs.andM;This is not to say that organizations need to adopt workstations on awholesale basis or that the costs associated with such purchases are notdaunting.andP;  In fact, the impact of workstation technology is such that mostcorporations place a high value on creating a strategic plan forworkstations.andP;  Involvement in this planning goes beyond just informationsystem management.andP;  Most companies create a task force of corporatewidemanagers, and some companies even make it a senior management issue.andP;  (See&quot;Workstation Strategies: What Is Involved.&quot;)andM;If an information system manager fails to provide state-of-the-art computingresources, he may be setting a tone for the company's overall operations.andO;Over the long term, this could lead to inefficiency and lethargy throughoutthe entire organization.andP;  The best and the brightest simply won's stay long,and replacing them won't be easy.andM;Workstations provide a flexible computing platform that is easily adopted tonew software.andP;  In fact, studies show that the pioneers who adoptedworkstations early are alreasy moving to advanced applications.andP;  How's thatfor a return on the initial workstation investment?andM;According to a study compiled by the KPMG Peat Marwick consulting company ofMountain View, Calif., and funded by Silicon Graphics, also of Mountain View,the Hitachi Power Group, a subsidiary of Hitachi Ltd., reduced the timeinvolved in the process of engineering a nuclear power plant from 500,000hours to 250,000 hours by using 3-D application software running on Unixworkstations.andP;  It allowed Hitachi to eliminate the need to have hundreds ofworkers maintain a plastic model of the plant during the layout process.andP;  Thestudy claimed the task normally would have required 600 people.andM;Hitachi also found that it could cut its planned final testing time in halfbecause the 3-D workstations provided accurate and detailed simulation tests.andO;Simulating the tests reduced the actual testing time and enabled Hitachi'scustomers to bring the plant on-line and into operation nime months sooner.andO;This is a perfect example of how a workstation can help bring a completedproduct to market early.andM;What does that mean in cash.andP;  For Hitachi's customers, testing a $1 billionnuclear power plant for 18 months would have meant $135 million in interestrate charges on a $1 billion investment.andP;  By cutting testing time in half,Hitachi saved time and money through the use of 3-D workstations.andM;The study finds that similar benefits were also realized at Douglas Aircraftof Long Beach, Calif.andP;  By using 3-D application software running overworkstations, Douglas was able to eliminate prototype and mock-up developmentprojects that could have cost anywhere from $25,000 to over $200,000.andM;In addition, Douglas was able to reduce engineering change orderssubstantially, which previously could have numbered as many as 20 changeorders per item.andM;Perhaps closer to home for the average chief executive is the case of KarstenManufacturing of Phoenix, Ariz., the manufacturer of custom-fitted Ping golfclubs.andP;  As the No.andP;  1 clubs on the PGA tour, the clubs are often standardequipment for the chief executive suite.andM;According to the KPMG Peat Marwick study, Karsten originally adoptedworkstations in order to shorten prototype time, identify imperfections moreeasily and reduce the number of drafters needed to design the clubs.andP;  Butperhaps the biggest payoff came when a competitor allegedly attempted to copythe design of the Ping golf club.andM;Karsten designers had the competitor's golf club digitized for analysis andwere able to prove that the club violated Kartsen patents, even though thetwo clubs were visibly very different.andP;  Confronted with Karsten's analysis,the competing vendor withdrew its product, saving Karsten legal fees and thechance that it migh have lost its case.andP;  One doesn't have to be a lawyer tounderstand the difficulties of convincing a jury of Karsten's claim, giventhe cosmetic differences between the two clubs.andM;Another case cited by the study involved chrysler, where workstation userscaught potential problems early in the design cycle and saved the company asmuch as $3 million.andP;  Chrysler also decided against constructing a planned $1million-plus accumulation conveyer belt when a workstation simulationconvinced management that the auto production line would flow smoothlywithout it.andM;Admittedly, Hitachi, Douglas, Karsten and Chrysler are on the cutting edge oftheir fields, but they attained this competitive edge through the earlyadoption of fundamental workstation technology.andM;Key to these successes is the fact that these corporations have placedsufficient local processing power at the disposal of their engineers to carryout CPU-intensive tasks, such as finite element modeling.andP;  This allowsengineers to experiment with different designs without being adverselyimpacted by--or impacting--other users running on a centralized time-sharingsystem.andP;  This local processing capability can be further leveraged throughthe use of visualization software that is too CPU-intensive to be runeffectively on a time-sharing system.andP;  With such visualization software, keyfeatures or aberrations in a project become readily identifiable, andengineers are no longer forced to go over reams of printed material lookingfor anomalies hidden in the data.andM;In tracking such benefits as those derived from visualization, it isextremely helpful--if not essential--to have a good historical database.andO;This database should provide resource accounting data that accuratelyreflects the amount and cost of user processing time on the VAX.andP;  In manycases, this data, along with some simple math, may be all that is required tojustify the use of workstations from a purely systems perspective.andM;Two areas in which organizations can expect to incur significant costs whenadopting workstations are maintenance and training.andP;  According toInternational Data Corp. (IDC), a market research company in Framingham,Mass., customers can expect to pay annual maintenance costs ranging from alow of $360 per workstation--about 3 percent of the purchase price--to a highof 12 percent of the total workstation system price.andM;This figure covers such expenses as software updates, new manuals andtelephone consulting.andP;  As a rule, ongoing workstation maintenance costs inthe first two years should be expected to cost approximately 5 to 10 percentof the initial purchase price.andP;  Costs then generally begin to rise in thethird and fourth years for storage and processor upgrades.andM;Quality of service and support have become major factors when selecting aworkstation vendor.andP;  With this in mind, most workstation buyers chooseon-site service from the manufacturer or dealer.andP;  According to a recent IDCstudy entitled &quot;User Requirements for Customer Service, Support and Trainingin the Technical Workstation Market,&quot; more than half of the DEC,Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Silicon Graphics and Sun users bought on-site hardwareservice contracts.andP;  About two-thirds of the respondents chose a one-year,on-site integrated hardware and software warranty.andM;Training costs are also a factor.andP;  Depending on user expertise, hardware andsoftware training may be required.andP;  According to IDC, some 16 percent ofusers surveyed buy hardware training, whereas 37 percent buy softwaretraining.andM;Most organizations, however, take the self-training path.andP;  Generally, userscan get up and running in a short time.andP;  For example, a U.S.andP;  Navy siteestimated that users were functional after about two hours of formaltraining.andP;  In many organizations, employees train on their own time or useidle machines.andP;  Still, in some cases, related courses in network and systemadministration may be needed.andM;Remember that maintenance and training are major sources of revenues forsystem vendors--sometimes accounting for as much as 40 percent of therevenues a manufacturer generates in a fiscal year.andP;  According to IDC,overall maintenance revenues garnered by system manufacturers for technicalworkstations without printers is expected to reach $129.9 million in 1992--a29 percent projected annual growth rate.andP;  Weigh maintenance optionscarefully, because after network and system administration costs, maintenanceis likely to be the second-largest hidden cost associated with purchasingworkstations.andM;Everybody does it and still nobody is satisfied: networking.andP;  Forworkstations, networking is a universal black hole.andP;  An objective in morethan 90 percent of the corporate workstation strategic plans, networkingoutdistances the second most common objective, user support, by nearly a 2-1ratio, according to Input, a consulting company in Mountain View, Calif.andO;(See &quot;Workstation Strategic Plan Objectives.&quot;)  And although everybody plansfor it, networking is still the one area where users seek the mostimprovements.andM;In Digital Review's poll of workstation buyers, faster network access was thearea most commonly cited for improvement, listed by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.andO;(See Poll, page 42.)andP;  Second on the list was more local storage, a problembuyers attributed to the slowness they encounter with file servers.andP;  Farbehind were the usual complaints of wanting faster processing and moresoftware.andM;When workstations have local processing, they inherently add a new level ofcomplexity to the nature of the distributed computing environment.andP;  In thisscenario, the VAX or other minicomputer system becomes the file server for agroup of workstations, which allows several engineers to share files and datain a highly interactive manner.andP;  In theory, this helps prevent engineers from&quot;reinventing the wheel,&quot; because now they can easily leverage work done byanother engineer.andM;The realities of distributed networked computing are not quite as rosy.andO;Although it is true that the integration of Unix-based workstations withVMS-based VAXes using TCP/IP is no longer the arduously slow task it oncewas, the overall networking technology required to build a truly distributedcomputing environment is still pretty much on the drawing board.andP;  In fact,the most delicate and costly aspect of implementing a distributed computingenvironment is the network itself.andP;  Any system manager who does not properlyappraise this cost is simply foolhardy.andP;  Some of the best multivendor localarea network implementations are often little more than jury-rigged affairsthat can fail for any one of a hundred reasons, including--swear some systemmanagers--the odd, occasional cross-eyed look.andM;And although the costs of networking software and hardware can be substantialin their own right, the real drain on financial resources comes in the areaof system administration.andP;  Simply put, by distributing local computing powerto every desk top, a system manager has succeeded in distributing a multitudeof CPUs that require system support.andP;  It is unrealistic to expect highly paidengineers to do their own system maintenance when the company is paying themto produce products.andM;Hire The Big GunsandM;So when an organization moves to a distributed computing environment based onworkstations, it can expect a tremendous boost in its system administrationcosts.andP;  Networking and system administration costs are difficult enough toabsorb in a homogeneous single-vendor environment; figure to pay more for amultivendor workstation site.andP;  Distributed networks combine workstations andservers based on a variety of incompatible architectures.andM;It often takes a deft hand to resolve file incompatibility issues betweendifferent systems.andP;  At the lowest level, a system or network manager canestablish a straightforward data link between nodes using TCP/IP, or whenVAXes running VMS are the servers, by putting DECnet Phase IV-compatiblesoftware on each of the foreign systems.andP;  When used to transfer text files,these varied solutions are generally capable of solving the data conversionproblems, but when used with other types of data, the level of complexityinvolved increases.andM;For example, Unix files tend to be simple in structure, consisting of just astream of bytes.andP;  By contrast, RMS files on the VAX are structured as recordsand come in several different file types.andP;  The RMS data file is simply theraw contents.andP;  In addition to the file contents, there is a file header thatdescribes what is in the file.andM;In binary file transfer mode, the information in the RMS file header istransferred as part of the file.andP;  Unfortunately, the receiving system couldinterpret that record structure information as part of the file itself,rather than as record structure information within the file.andP;  Workstationbuyers will need to ensure that their connectivity software is smart enoughto handle this problem.andM;In addition, there remains the classical Big-Endian vs.andP;  Little-Endian byteordering problem between systems.andP;  A site with a Mips M/120 running RISCs anda DECstation running Ultrix will encounter this problem even though bothsystems are based on the same Mips R2000 CPU chip.andP;  There is a highprobability that the bytes on an RMS file won't appear in the right orderonce transferred to a foreign system, particularly if the file was written in16-byte words on the VMS system.andM;Thanks for PlayingandM;System vendors are also having difficulty resolving links between VMS and thede facto NFS industry standard.andP;  The basic problem in this area concerns poorfile-naming conventions and the fact that leading NFS implementations on theVAX only allow VMS systems to export files to an NFS-based system, not toimport files from NFS systems.andM;To make matters worse, connectivity issues are likely to become even morecomplex in the near term as the Unix industry divides into two camps alongOpen Software Foundation (OSF) and Unix International (UI) lines.andP;  OSF issponsored primarily by Hewlett-Packard, DEC and IBM, whereas members of UIsupport the ATandamp;T/Sun Microsystems Unix System V operating system.andM;But dealing with different Unix operating systems will be nothing new formost system managers.andP;  The real problem is that both OSF and UI are alsopushing different user interfaces.andP;  OSF supports the Motif user interface,which combines DEC's XUI took kit with the HP/Microsoft implementation ofPresentation Manager, while ATandamp;T and Sun are advocating the Open Look userinterface.andM;Over time, software developers will be forced to come up with some type ofconnectivity strategy that will bridge these two environments seamlessly.andO;But as of today, anyone facing a networking challenge such as setting uptask-to-task communications over TCP/IP on different Unix-based workstationswill discover numerous incompatibilities between so-called standard socketlibraries.andP;  Considering the fact that application software for theseenvironments is just now being formulated, it is highly unlikely that theconnectivity issues between the two environments will be resolved anytimesoon.andM;In the meantime, workstation suppliers will continue making enhancements toprovide even richer multitasking windowing environments that allow users tomore efficiently access multiple files simultaneously over a network.andP;  At aneven higher level of network integration, constructs such as remote procedurecalls and ATandamp;T's Streams will be used to develop network architectures thatwill allow applications to harness the power of multiple workstationsdispersed throughout a LAN for a single application.andM;Through such a strategy, a system manager would, for example, be able todistribute local computing power to engineers by day, then reallocate thetotal power of all workstation CPUs on the network to run a fewnumber-crunching, compute-intensive applications in parallel across thenetwork by night.andM;One bright spot on the horizon regarding capital spending as well as networkand system administration is the advent of terminals that run the X WindowSystem.andP;  Although not currently installed in large volumes, these terminalswill probably start to show up on users' desk top in large numbers during themiddle of next year.andP;  This should coincide with the availability of a numberof X windows-based software applications.andM;Windowing terminals will not provide all the functions found in aworkstation, but they do provide many of the ease-of-use graphical featuressought by most end users.andP;  In addition, they are significantly easier tomanage from the point of view of a system administrator.andP;  Generally, onlyabout 600KB of disk space is required on the client system--the terminals areconsidered to be the X server--to boot any number of terminals, because theyall share the same kernel on the system.andP;  When contrasted to a disklessworkstation, sessions running on a windowing terminal produce less networktraffic and are less likely to overload the network.andM;A diskless workstation running an operating system and using virtual memoryto access applications over a network requires the server to dedicate about30MB of disk space for every workstation with which it communicates.andP;  Thismuch space is needed to support the constant back-and-forth communicationthat a diskless node generates across the network.andP;  In addition, a newrelease of an operating system will require the system manager to update boththe server and the workstations.andM;Eventually, companies are expected to employ a mix of X windows terminals,desktop personal computers and workstations as each type of system carves outan application niche.andP;  For example, applications that require some type oflocal processing capability, such a desktop publishing or softwaredevelopment, will need to be supported by the power of a full-fledgedworkstation.andP;  On the other hand, financial applications, such as generalledger, payroll and spreadsheets, may be better-served by an X windowsterminal.andM;For the foreseeable future, personal computers will continue to play adominant role on desk tops, largely due to the sheer number of PCs and thewealth of application software.andP;  But from a financial stance, PCs arerelatively poor choices, because workstations offer about 25 times the levelof raw performance power for about only twice the price of a PC.andM;Furthermore, workstations can now run MS-DOS applications through softwareemulation programs and co-processors at the same speed of faster than a PCAT, and every one of the top 10 MS-DOS application software developers ishard at work at developing a Unix version of its software for release nextyear.andM;Interestingly, the availability of popular commercial software packages andthe significant better price/performance they provide is likely to result ina major change in where and how workstations are purchased.andP;  The businessreality for most value-added resellers (VARs) and OEMs is that as workstationprices deteriorate, the margins on those products decline substantially.andP;  Inorder to maintain its present level of income, a VAR is forced to sell moreworkstations, which is usually difficult, given the size of the VAR's salesforce and market niche.andP;  As a result, most VARs would rather focus theirefforts on higher-margin products where they can make a higher profit persale.andM;Starting next year, customers can expect to see retail outlets begin to focusmore heavily on low-end workstation sales as the market continues to evolveinto a low-margin, high-volume business.andP;  For example, a report compiled bySummit Strategies, a market research company in Boston, estimates that by1993, 40 percent of workstation CAD systems will be sold directly by vendors,30 percent will be sold through OEMs and 25 percent will be sold by retaildealers.andP;  By contrast, the report said that last year, 45 percent ofworkstation CAD systems were sold directly by vendors, 50 percent by OEMs and5 percent through other channels.andM;But perhaps the biggest potential headache regarding the purchase of aworkstation concerns the timing of the purchase rather than the actualpurchase decision itself.andP;  Over the past two years, workstation vendors haveengaged in what is probably the most aggressive price/performance war in thecomputer industry's history.andP;  Product life cycles in the workstation marketare about 12 months long, and the pace of new product introductions isexpected to accelerate drastically in the coming year.andM;One fortunate outcome of today's wars is that prices for low-end workstationsare expected to drop even more during the 1990s, when the technology curvewill also drive down price/performance.andM;In the early 1990s, many base-level configurations of 10-MIPS workstationsare expected to break the $4,000 threshold.andP;  These systems will feature atleast 4MB of memory and 80MB of storage.andP;  In some cases, prices will be belowthose of less-powerful PS/2 systems.andM;Leasing PaysandM;These rapid technological advances have led to a rise in the popularity ofworkstation leasing.andP;  According to some industry estimates, some 40 to 50percent of all workstations are now leased.andP;  This is in sharp contrast to theresponses in Digital Review's poll of VAX sites, Which showed that only 12percent of the sites leased or rented workstations (See Poll, page 42.)andO;Overall in the workstation market, the average lease duration is two to fouryears.andM;Leasing can be advantageous for organization, because a fast-changing marketmakes it tricky to figure out the best way to pay for workstations.andO;Organizations often are in the difficult position of acquiring newworkstations on a five-year or seven-year plan, only to have the equipmentbecome obsolete in 18 months.andM;Leasing workstations has other appeals as well: With no up-front spending,organizations can get the latest workstation technology.andP;  In a year or two,if the lease is properly written, they can trade in the old machines fornewer ones without financial loss.andM;Interest rates for leased equipment often are lower than for equipmentpurchases.andP;  Monthly payments for leases also are likely to be lower becauseat the end of the lease, bankers can expect to get either residual value orthe actual equipment, which can then be sold at a profit.andM;Industry experts say leasing provides the ideal ground between the still-rarepractice of renting workstations for short-term projects and buying themoutright as part of a longer-term plan.andM;Right now, most leasing is done through manufacturers and distributors.andO;Vendors typically offer several different kinds of leasing.andM;The three basic kinds are operational leasing, lease/purchase and financeleasing, in which the lessor deducts the residual value of the equipment.andP;  Onaverage, the latter is the least-expensive type of lease in terms of dollarsspent, but it may not represent the best value over the long haul.andP;  Perhapsthe biggest disadvantage of leasing without a commitment to purchasing theequipment at the end of the lease is the loss of the 20 percent annualcorporate tax allowance on the depreciation of capital goods.andP;  Withoutacquiring the workstations at the end of the lease, the tax write-off goesnot to your company, but to the leasing company.andM;In general, leasing especially benefits first-time buyers, small orundercapitalized companies that can't tie up funds, and organizations thatare in a state of flux and anticipate major organizational changes in theshort term.andM;Despite the difficulties associated with building distributed computingenvironments and the costs associated with maintaining workstations, thebenefits of workstations in terms of enhancing an organization's ability tocompete far outweight the negatives.andP;  Experts are not being bold when theysay every company in the Fortune 500 has already adopted workstations, andthat most midsized corporations will follow shortly.andM;The San Jose, Calif.-based market research company Dataquest predicts thatlast year's $4.3 billion in workstation sales will quadruple by 1993.andP;  NewYork investment research company Sanford C. Bernstein predicts thatworkstations will be a $22.3 billion market by 1992, with an annual growthrate of 36.5 percent.andP;  Dataquest expects a 15 percent growth rate in a marketit describes as healthy and sustained.andM;Simply put, if your company has not yet adopted workstations on some level,the odds are that it is behind its competition.andP;  If your company has alreadyadopted workstations, the time has come to begin investigating the next levelof workstation performance.andP;  This means advanced software applications andnetworking.andM;Workstations are here to stay.andP;  The future customer site is going to consistof a multitude of workstations that communicate with minicomputers andmainframes acting as central-server repositories for shared resources.andM;Failure to adopt workstations now is likely to result in problems later on,including significantly higher training costs, as the technology willundoubtedly become more complicated and the learning curve steeper.andP;  Betterto bite the bullet today than to have the competition fire a bullet with yourcompany's name on it tomorrow.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
