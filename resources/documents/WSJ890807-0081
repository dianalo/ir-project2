The Shiite extremists holding U.S. and other Western hostages in Lebanon began to bargain yesterday over their release. The &quot;Revolutionary Justice Organization,&quot; the group that just last week threatened to kill U.S. hostage Joseph Cicippio, announced that it will free him if Israel releases a Shiite cleric it has kidnapped, as well as 150 other Lebanese Shiite prisoners and 300 Palestinians it is holding. The organization also demanded that Israel allow the return of Palestinian activists it recently deported.    That offer certainly won't be acceptable to Israel, which insists that three Israeli soldiers believed held in Lebanon as well as 15 other Western hostages -- including seven from the U.S. -- be released in any swap. But it shows that the hostage-holders are beginning to dicker over what conditions would produce freedom for hostages.    Israel and the Shiite groups holding hostages now are bargaining mainly through public statements, but Israeli officials say they also have been holding discussions with Shiite leaders and intermediaries in southern Lebanon.    The Bush administration, without officially changing U.S. policy against negotiating with hostage-takers, is tacitly cooperating in the bargaining -- as long as Israel takes the public lead. Secretary of State James Baker acknowledged as much yesterday when he told reporters that the U.S. and Israel are &quot;consulting very, very closely together with respect to the whole range of issues that are involved here.&quot; Flying to Mexico for a meeting, Mr. Baker told reporters on his plane that &quot;consulting with a country that pursues a policy of negotiations is not tantamount to negotiating yourself.&quot;    For his part, President Bush also is signaling that he will have &quot;a little bit greater flexibility&quot; in discussions over the hostages than the U.S. has shown in the last few years, said one senior administration official.    As an indication, the official pointed to a carefully worded statement given by President Bush on Friday when he was asked to respond to a declaration by Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani that Iran is ready to work with the White House to resolve the hostage situation. &quot;I don't know what it means fully, but I think the world is familiar with our policy,&quot; Mr. Bush said. &quot;But there will be nothing that will be done ever that will create a new incentive for taking somebody else hostage.&quot;    The statement by the president suggests &quot;there might be a way of having discussions in a way that won't encourage people to take hostages,&quot; said the official.    &quot;The fact is, the bazaar is open&quot; Richard Murphy, until recently the assistant secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs, said yesterday on NBC-TV's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;    The White House didn't have any response yesterday to the offer from Mr. Cicippio's captors, which came less than a week after a related Shiite group claimed to have killed U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins. But the administration's strategy is to give Israel a green light to pursue a deal involving U.S. hostages as well as Israeli soldiers. Because the bargaining chips being used in the dealing -- Lebanese Shiites now in Israeli hands -- aren't controlled by the U.S., the Bush administration doesn't have to be directly involved in the give-and-take. Meanwhile, the U.S. has sent its own messages, about the importance it attaches to the hostages, to Algeria and others thought to be influential with the hostage-holders and the Iranian government that is believed to inspire them.    Despite the signs of movement, of course, it will be enormously difficult to strike any deal resulting in the release of hostages. Over the weekend, for instance, both the Lebanese terrorists holding the hostages and Iran, which has supported the terrorists, sent conflicting signals.    At the same time that Mr. Cicippio's captors were suggesting a deal for his release, Hussein Mousawi, a leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah party, threatened to kill one of the Israeli soldiers held by Shiites unless Israel frees Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, the Lebanese cleric it kidnapped. And Hezbollah also insisted that it won't release Israeli soldiers as part of any deal. Hezbollah is a Lebanese Shiite organization that is believed to be the sponsor of the smaller groups holding hostages in Lebanon.    The key to breaking the hostage impasse may well lie in the hints that Iran wants a less hostile relationship with the U.S. now that Ayatollah Khomeini has died and Mr. Rafsanjani has risen to the presidency. &quot;The U.S. ought to keep its eye on the Iranian negotiations and not on the Lebanese negotiations,&quot; said former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger yesterday on ABC-TV's &quot;This Week with David Brinkley.&quot;    Mr. Bush said he was pleased with Mr. Rafsanjani's statement Friday that &quot;the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent solutions.&quot; Privately, Mr. Bush's aides say that, while intrigued with the turn of rhetoric, they remain skeptical. There won't be &quot;any real recognition there's a real opening&quot; until Tehran's leaders produce &quot;tangible actions&quot; to illustrate they've changed their behavior, said one administration aide.    U.S. officials also remain uncertain about the control Mr. Rafsanjani can exert over his government even if he wants to be helpful. Other powerful Iranian officials are far less interested in cooperating with the West. In the past, Lebanese Shiite extremists have taken their lead from Iran's hard-line interior minister, Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, whose comments have been far less encouraging than Mr. Rafsanjani's in the last week.    Yesterday's statement from Mr. Cicippio's captors also suggested that Syria, whose forces patrol the area of Lebanon where hostages are believed held, could be instrumental in arranging a solution. Mr. Cicippio's captors appealed to Syria to &quot;agree to negotiate through international organizations to ensure success&quot; of the captors' offer. </TEXT></DOC>
