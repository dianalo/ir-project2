As proposed, the Duracell offering would amount to one ofthe biggest stock issues this year. The Bethel, Conn.,battery company said it plans to offer new stock to thepublic at $12 to $14 a share, which would raise a total of$240 million to $280 million.</LP><TEXT>   After the offering is completed, the public would own19.1% of the stock on a fully diluted basis, Duracellmanagement would own 10.3% and the leveraged buy-out firm ofKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. would own the rest.   With its filing, Duracell becomes the latest in a flurryof leveraged, closely held companies that want to go publicin the wake of the stock market's runup earlier this year.Other recent examples include retailers Caldor Corp. and AnnTaylor Holdings Inc., as well as auto-parts marketer AutoZoneInc. All have taken steps in the past month to raise moneyfrom public stock offerings and pay off some debt.   &quot;We view the issue as good news,&quot; said Phelps Hoyt, a bondanalyst at Duff andamp; Phelps/MCM Investment Research. He notedthat Duracell plans to use proceeds to shrink its $1.41billion of long-term debt to $1.16 billion. That would lowerDuracell's debt-to-equity ratio from an aggressive 4.1-to-1to a somewhat more conservative 1.9-to-1.   &quot;This gives the company sufficient equity capital toweather any kind of economic cycle,&quot; added Mariel Clemenson,head of junk-bond research at Citicorp.   For the six months ended Dec. 29, 1990, Duracell reportedthat net income rose 16% to $61.3 million, or 83 cents ashare, on a 14% increase in revenue, to $922 million.   Analysts said they would be hardpressed to value thecompany on a price-earnings basis based on the past sixmonths, however. That is partly because the company generallydoes best during the autumn, benefiting from the Christmasselling season, while posting weaker results in the winterand spring. For fiscal 1990, ended June 30, Duracell had netincome of just $5.8 million, or eight cents a share.   Partly offsetting any seasonal weakness, Duracell'searnings would likely get a boost from the debt reductioninvolved in the public offering. On a pro-forma basis, thecompany said, interest expense would drop $34 million a yearif the stock offering is completed.   Duracell in the U.S. and Western Europe competes chieflywith Ralston Purina Co.'s Eveready battery unit. &quot;It's ahotly contested category,&quot; says a Ralston spokesman.   At year-end 1990, Duracell had a 43% share of the U.S.alkaline battery market, according to A.C. Nielsen andamp; Co. Thatwas about six percentage points ahead of Eveready. &quot;Duracellin recent years has gained a few market share points againstus,&quot; the Ralston spokesman said, &quot;although in the last yearor six months, we've been coming back.&quot;   Duracell's most rapid growth has come in Europe, whererevenue climbed 33% for the six months ended last Dec. 29.Duracell's gains came in spite of increased competition inthe British market. Key Note Ltd., a London research concernnoted in a recent report, that several big electronicscompanies have begun making inroads in the British market,putting &quot;the major names {such as Duracell} on thedefensive.&quot;   Duracell had been a unit of Kraft Inc. until being takenprivate in a 1988 leveraged buy-out. At that time,partnerships controlled by KKR paid $5 a share for nearly$350 million of stock in Duracell. Although KKR isn't sellingany shares of Duracell in the current offering, the indicatedprice of $12 to $14 a share would suggest sizable paperprofits for the buy-out firm.   The underwriters for Duracell's stock offering are MerrillLynch andamp; Co., Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.</TEXT></DOC>
