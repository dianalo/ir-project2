Residents mounted a taxrevolt. They planted their own vegetable gardens to replaceIsraeli produce. Even a local cow, mainstay of an undergrounddairy, won nationalist fame.   Today, only the graffiti remains from those days ofrock-throwing and rebellion. Carloads of Jewish settlers,once the target of nearly every Palestinian teen-ager, passby with impunity. So tranquil are the streets and olivegroves that the Israeli army recently abandoned its mainoutpost here -- a move Arabs aren't sure constitutes victoryor defeat.</LP><TEXT>   It's crunch time for the Palestinians, as the world awaitsthe Palestinian Liberation Organization's decision tonight onwhether it will go along with a Mideast peace conference. Butbehind the PLO's posturing, its hand has been weakened by thecollapse of the intifada as well as Palestinian support forIraq's invasion of Kuwait.   Palestinian violence still erupts often in the West Bankand Gaza Strip, and attacks on Israelis with firearms haveincreased. Yesterday, Israeli soldiers shot and killed threePalestinians and wounded a fourth in a clash in the WestBank. But the unrest that swept the territories in the threeyears before the Persian Gulf War is all but dead, erasingwhat was the Palestinians' best weapon for galvanizing bothIsraeli and world opinion.   In the intifada's place, political activism in theoccupied lands has turned inward. Many of the masked youthsso familiar on TV news in the early years of the uprising nowspend their time hunting and punishing other Arabs suspectedof collaborating with Israel.   The internecine purge has taken about 500 Palestinianlives in the past four years, including 21 this month. Thesituation recalls an Arab revolt in the 1930s against theBritish authorities in Palestine that collapsed intointra-Palestinian warfare that resulted in thousands of Arabdeaths and, some historians believe, the State of Israel.   &quot;The uprising has reached another stage,&quot; says Ahmed, an18-year-old activist from Beit Sahur, which lies in theJudean hills below Bethlehem. &quot;Now the spotlight is on thecollaborator problem. If we're ever going to have our ownstate, we must clean it from the inside.&quot;   It's a painful process. Sitting in their small home herenext to Shepherd's Field, where Christians believe the threewise men saw the star of Bethlehem, the Moussa family gropesto explain why 20-year-old Salim, sulking in a corner, isn'tthe collaborator local activists say he is.   &quot;Nobody in the village will even light my cigarette anymore,&quot; says family patriarch Nasser Moussa.   Mohammed, 25, points to the scars on his brother'sshoulder, &quot;rubber bullet wounds,&quot; he says. &quot;Look at those oldclothes. If he were a collaborator, he'd have money, right?&quot;   Whenever a car drives by, brother Hader, 29, jumps to lookout the window. His wife's beauty salon was recentlyfire-bombed by youths for no apparent reason, he says. &quot;Iwish another war would happen and wipe us all out,&quot; he says.&quot;The new generation would be different.&quot;   Away from his family, Salim Moussa is tense but moreforthcoming. He wants to move from the village, he says,perhaps to the U.S. or Europe. He carries a 10-inch kitchenknife in his belt. Usually, though, he doesn't leave hishouse.   He was a collaborator before, Salim says, recruited forpocket change by an Israeli named &quot;Tony,&quot; who threatened toput Salim in prison if he didn't cooperate. But Salim insistshe never did half the things villagers say he has done. Andanyway, he says, he gave up collaborating several months ago.   &quot;Once a collaborator, always a collaborator,&quot; says anactivist, asked about Salim's case.   Along with the killings, the definition of who is acollaborator is expanding. In recent months, Palestinianshave been murdered for selling Israeli goods, working for thecivil administration in the territories, working as villagepolicemen and marrying Jews. An Israeli intelligence officersays 60% of Palestinians killed by Arabs were never Israeliinformants.   &quot;Fighting collaborators is an essential part of fightingIsrael,&quot; says Ahmed, the Beit Sahur activist. &quot;It's thebiggest shame. It requires the biggest punishment.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
