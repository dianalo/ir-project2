Drug-importing Asian criminal gangs ``are moving in to fill thevoid'' left by the successful prosecution of Sicilian Mafia membersin the United States, FBI Director William Sessions said in astatement Friday.   Cracking the Chinese heroin ring with a series of arrests Fridayended a two-year undercover probe called Operation Bamboo Dragonthat was launched after federal agents were told a restaurant ownerin the Chinatown section of Washington was buying stolen firearmsand distributing cocaine.   Eleven people were arrested in Hong Kong and nine in the UnitedStates as investigators seized 137 pounds of heroin worthover $100million.   Five of those arrested in New York were charged with conspiringto supply 1,000 M-16 military rifles to undercover federal agentsand to provide false documents so that the rifles could be shippedto Libya, said the U.S. Customs Service and the Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms.   ``This gang was capable of putting enormous firepower into thehands of terrorists and drug smugglers,'' Customs commissionerWilliam von Raab said in a statement. Federal officials said at anews conference that the ring had supplied 600 handguns, mostly toChinese gangs.   The FBI and ATF inserted undercover operatives into theoperation, including a Chinese-speaking agent who portrayed himselfas a drug dealer.   The Cantonese-speaking federal agent, Frederick Yau, met withgang members in Washington and Hong Kong to negotiate the purchaseof heroin from Asia.   The heroin came from Burma and China and was transported to SanFrancisco and New York City's Chinatown. It also was distributed toNewark, N.J., Alexandria, Va., and Washington.   U.S. members of the ring were selling hundreds of stolen orillegally obtained pistols, machine guns and rifles on the streetsof New York City, usually to Chinese gangs.   Many of the firearms were obtained with fraudulentidentification documents from gun shops in Fort Worth, Dallas andHouston, Texas, the officials said.   The Chinese gangs were buying AR-15 semi-automatic rifles _ thecivilian version of the Army's M-16 rifle _ and converting theminto fully automatic M-16s.   Customs and ATF undercover agents bought 10 weapons from thefive people charged in New York City and ordered 1,000 more M-16sthat were to be delivered to Libya. Such shipments would haveviolated the Arms Export Control Act, which sets up federallicensing procedures for the sale of weapons to foreign countries.   The Drug Enforcement Administration was a major participant inthe probe, law enforcement officials said at a news conference inWashington announcing the arrests.</TEXT></DOC>
