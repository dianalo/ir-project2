(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Political eccentric Lyndon LaRouche's``security'' fund was used to pay for items including a piano,haircuts, flowers, shoes and cufflinks, according to testimony inhis tax fraud trial.   LaRouche financial officer Kathy Magraw acknowledged on Wednesdaythat the movement's security account paid for items which _according to prosecutors _ should have been declared as taxableincome.   LaRouche's trial continues today in U.S. District Court, where heis charged with conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service.A grand jury accused LaRouche of failing to declare as income thepersonal and household expenses financed by his organizations, andof refusing to file federal tax returns since 1979.   By calling Ms. Magraw to the stand, prosecutors continued using astrategy of compelling LaRouche aides to testify about themovement's finances under grants of limited immunity fromprosecution.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson said Ms. Magraw's testimonywould not only support the tax count, but charges that LaRouche andsix co-defendants in the case conspired to defraud lenders by notrepaying their loans to his organizations.   The personal expenditures cited by Ms. Magraw were made while theLaRouche organization was contending that no discretionary money wasavailable to repay some $25 million of the more than $30 millionlent to the movement. About $5 million was repaid, according toearlier testimony.   Trying to rebut the personal expense testimony, defense lawyersattempted to show that the vast majority of money spent for LaRouchewas for legitimate security and research purposes _ not for hispersonal benefit.   The defense effort was cut short, however, by U.S. District JudgeAlbert V Bryan Jr. He refused to allow any defense questioning ofMs. Magraw on the movement's need for consultants, who were paidweekly, monthly, daily, and flat payments. Defense lawyers describedthe consultants as national security experts.   The defense struck out, too, when it tried to question thewitness about payments for security protection for two LatinAmerican members of LaRouche's organization. The defense contendedthey were threatened by drug dealers, and were given refuge withtheir families in LaRouche's Leesburg, Va., estate.   The government, on the other hand, was permitted to introduce amemo prepared by Ms. Magraw, in which she said listing consultantpayments under ``legal investigations, services rendered forpersonal research'' was ``not a particularly defensible positionunder IRS scrutiny.''   Ms. Magraw testified that she really didn't know if the expenseswere listed improperly under IRS regulations.   Robinson, the prosecutor, had Ms. Magraw read for jurors some ofthe expenses from LaRouche's ``security'' fund, which was designedfor the personal security of LaRouche, his aides and his guests.   Among the items was a $7,000 piano and furniture for LaRouche'sLeesburg estate; cufflinks, for LaRouche; shoes for LaRouche's wife,Helga; film; clothes for LaRouche; flowers; luggage costing $415.96;a hairdresser appointment for Mrs. LaRouche and a $10 haircut forLaRouche; a $25 hairdresser appointment for an unidentified person,and reimbursement for a wine purchase.   Ms. Magraw said the furniture and piano were for a building wherethe LaRouche organization scheduled political and cultural events.   LaRouche's political movement embraces a number of unorthodoxpositions and relies heavily on conspiracy theories involving suchfigures as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the queenof England.   Another LaRouche finance officer, Richard Welsh, testifiedWednesday that he thought Kissinger might be responsible for themovement's financial problems.   Welsh said he based his theory, in part, on a letter fromKissinger to the FBI in 1982, which the LaRouche organizationobtained under the Freedom of Information Act.   Kissinger wrote, ``Because these people have been gettingincreasingly obnoxious, I have taken the liberty of asking mylawyer, Bill Rogers, to get in touch with you to ask your advice,especially with respect to security.''   Welsh testified that he sent a memo to LaRouche about Kissingerin October 1984, in the midst of LaRouche's second of threepresidential campaigns.   ``You stated in the memo that Kissinger was behind the actions''to hurt the LaRouche organization financially, asked Assistant U.S.Attorney Kent Robinson.   ``It was the primary but not the only suggestion I made,'' Welshtestified.   LaRouche was indicted in October on 13 counts of mail fraud,conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the IRS.The mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters ofcredit sent through the mails by the LaRouche organization.Conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 yearsin prison and fines of $3.25 million for LaRouche.   The six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mailfraud and conspiracy charges, which cover the years 1983 to 1987.   On trial with LaRouche are his chief fund-raiser, William Wertz;his legal adviser, Edward Spannaus; and four fund-raisers: MichaelBillington, Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.</TEXT></DOC>
