The drop from 79.3% in March brought the rate to the lowest level since December 1983, when it was 78.3%. Declines were widespread last month throughout manufacturing, the Fed said, but the rates rose for mining and utilities.    Separately, the National Association of Business Economists released a quarterly survey showing that its members have increased their forecasts for inflation and interest rates this year, and still expect economic growth to pick up from last year. The economists also foresee continued improvement in the nation's trade deficit this year, with about 25% of those surveyed reporting &quot;significant improvement&quot; in their companies' export performance in the past three months.    The Fed report said the latest decline brought the operating rate to slightly below the narrow range that had prevailed for a year. The March level was previously reported as 79.2%.    Douglas Handler, senior economist at Wharton Econometrics in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said the April drop reflects &quot;an adjustment following overproduction in the first part of the year.&quot; He said production likely will pick up once the excess output is worked through.    The operating rate for manufacturers fell to 79.5% from 80%. The rate for producers of durable goods, which are designed to last three years or more, declined to 76% from 76.7%; the level for producers of nondurable goods dropped to 84.6% from 84.9%.    The rate for mining industries rose to 72.8% from 72.5%, while utilities operated at 79.5%, up from 79.3%. For producers of industrial materials, the rate declined to 78.2% from 78.4%.    The business economists' survey showed that they expect prices to increase 4.3% this year. That's up from 4% in the first-quarter survey and sharply above the 1.1% actual rise in prices for all of last year. The prime rate is expected to be 8% at year-end; in the first-quarter survey they put this at 7.5%.    They said the real gross national product, the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's total output of goods and services, is expected to expand 2.9% this year and next, measured from the fourth quarter to fourth quarter.    The economists don't expect the recovery to last indefinitely, however. Jerry Jordan, president of the association, said that &quot;virtually all of the business analysts look for a recession to occur within the next five years.&quot;    About 11% of those surveyed expect a recession to start this year, with 32% expecting one in 1988, 48% in 1989, 7% in 1990 and 2% in 1991.    The economists expect the civilian unemployment rate to be 6.6% in the fourth quarter, compared with 6.3% currently. </TEXT></DOC>
