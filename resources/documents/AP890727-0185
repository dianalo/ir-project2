One Democratic leader said he and others in his party would ``goto the wall'' to block a constitutional amendment against flagdesecration, which the Republicans and President Bush say isnecessary.   The House Judiciary Committee, in a quarrelsome session, voted28-6 for a statute that says, ``Whoever knowingly mutilates,defaces, burns or tramples upon any flag of the United States shallbe fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year,or both.''   All but one of the 13 Republicans voting supported the bill _ asa symbolic gesture for the flag, one said. But the Republicanleadership blocked the Democrats' plan to bring the bill before thefull House next week.   House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois told reportersthat White House Chief of Staff John Sununu urged the GOPleadership this week to speak out more on the flag because it was a``wedge issue'' _ one that breaks the Democrats apart.   Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said at a news conferenceafter the vote that the bill would come up in September and hecouldn't imagine why any lawmaker would favor amending theconstitution if a regular statute would protect the flag.   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., added, ``Thepeople who pose as the most vigilant supporters of flag protection... seem more interested in adding political graffiti to theConstitution than in protecting the physical integrity of theAmerican flag.''   The Democrats carried with them the U.S. flag that flew over theCapitol the day Pearl Harbor was attacked, in Rome after that citywas liberated, and over the U.S.S. Missouri when Gen. DouglasMacArthur accepted Japan's surrender.   In the war of symbols, Bush had used the Iwo Jima memorial tothe Marines when he endorsed the constitutional amendment.   In the committee, GOP members were repeatedly beaten back whenthey attempted to scuttle the legislation, including a secondattempt in two days to substitute a constitutional amendment.   ``The purpose of this statute is to provide appropriateprotection for the American flag without getting into the firstretreat in American history (from) the Bill of Rights,'' said Rep.Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the committee's constitutionalrights subcommittee.   ``That is something we will go to the wall for in the morning,in the afternoon and in the evening,'' he said.   But Republicans said the only way to overcome the Supreme Courtruling was with a constitutional amendment.   ``The bill is essentially useless,'' said Rep. Carlos Moorhead,R-Calif., who said Republicans would vote for it in committee onlyas in symbolic support of the flag.   At the White House, spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the statuteproposed in Congress was unconstitutional and unworkable.   ``The amendment is the only way to go,'' she said predicting theamendment eventually will go to the floor and pass.   Although determined to try a statute first, before aconstitutional amendment, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks,D-Texas, said he would back an amendment if the statute didn't work.   ``If the Supreme Court should rule down this statute, which I donot believe they will ... I would introduce a constitutionalamendment,'' Brooks told his committee.   The measure passed in the committee after opponents from boththe left and the right attacked it.   ``This statute is a mess, and it's obvious it's a mess fromeverything we've seen and heard this morning,'' said Rep. ChuckDouglas, R-N.H., a conservative who was blocked by Brooks when hetried to offer a constitutional amendment.   Douglas, the only Republican to vote against the bill, protestedwhat he suggested were Democratic strong-arm tactics with props forthe television cameras, including a gag over his mouth and a pairof flags, one dirty and one clean.   The latter was to demonstrate his doubts about a section of thebill allowing for disposal of worn or soiled flags, traditionallydone by burning.   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., one of five Democrats who votedagainst the statute and who also oppose a constitutional amendment,offered an amendment to ban cross burnings.   ``Cross burnings for centuries have been more of a problem inthe United States than flag burnings,'' said Conyers, who was alsoruled out of order by Brooks.   The Senate is to take up both a proposed statute andconstitutional amendment on flag desecration in October.</TEXT></DOC>
