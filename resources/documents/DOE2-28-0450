In order to raise the speed ofconversion, the catalyst layer is in electrical contact with bodies madeof electrically conducting material, on the side towards the solution.The bodies are distributed over the solution, at least in the area ofthe catalyst layer, and increase the surface active in the conversionof the dissolved material.</TEXT></DOC>
