Texas Instruments last year sued in U.S. District Court here, alleging that nine Japanese and South Korean electronics concerns were making semiconductor memory chips based on its patents. The suits were seen as part of a broad Texas Instruments campaign to put more emphasis on defending the company's so-called intellectual property. Last month, Texas Instruments settled with two of the concerns named in the suits, Fujitsu Ltd. and Sharp Corp.    Toshiba settled under the same terms as Fujitsu and Sharp, Texas Instruments said. Toshiba will pay &quot;significant&quot; fixed royalties and additional per-unit royalties to Texas Instruments in return for licenses to make and sell the chips in the U.S. Texas Instruments wouldn't specify the payments.    In addition, Texas Instruments will receive licenses for certain Toshiba patents. The company asked that Toshiba be dropped from a related complaint filed with the International Trade Commission against the Japanese and South Korean companies.    The U.S. International Trade Commission has 30 days to review the motion to drop Toshiba from its probe. The commission this week approved a similar motion regarding Fujitsu and Sharp, Texas Instruments said. The Japanese government also must approve the settlement.    The other companies named in the suits are Hitachi Ltd., Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Oki Electric Industry Co., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., NEC Corp., all of Japan, and Samsung Co. of South Korea. </TEXT></DOC>
