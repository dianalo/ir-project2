Smith andamp; Co. said Energy Service Co.'s$100 million offer for shares of Penrod Holding Corp.controlled by Smith is underpriced and &quot;highly conditional.&quot;   Ensco, a Dallas-based oil service company, has offered topay $8 a share for just over 12 million Penrod shares held bySmith as trustee. If successful, the tender offer would giveEnsco control of Penrod, an offshore oil-drilling contractoronce owned by the Hunt family of Texas.</LP><TEXT>   But Smith, a Wall Street firm which specializes in buyingstakes in distressed companies, said the price is &quot;far toolow&quot; and is $1 a share below what Ensco had already offeredinformally. Smith said it hired PaineWebber Inc. to evaluateEnsco's offer and advise it on alternatives.   Ensco officials, meanwhile, will lay out financing plansand other offer details at a meeting this afternoon in NewYork. Smith said PaineWebber executives would attend themeeting on its behalf.   Smith controls about 16 million Penrod shares, Ensco haseight million and the remaining 40 million are held byvarious partnerships that include Bankers Trust Co. andGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co.   Smith and Ensco have had a falling out over how best toallow Smith to get out of Penrod quickly and with a profitwhile allowing Ensco to retain long-term management ofPenrod's rig fleet.   An Ensco official said Smith has pushed for an initialpublic offering, but Ensco believes the timing would be badbecause of the current slump in the offshore drilling market.In addition, an offering would scuttle Ensco's plan to runPenrod.   Ralph Watts, executive vice president at Smith Barney,Harris Upham andamp; Co., Ensco's investment banker, said acomplicating factor is that it isn't clear if the Smithshares, held in trust for numerous investors, can be votedseparately or if Smith controls the vote. Mr. Watts believesSmith doesn't actually own many Penrod shares itself but hedoesn't know who the owners are or how many there are.</TEXT></DOC>
