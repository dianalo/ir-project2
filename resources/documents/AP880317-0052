The White House said Wednesday it was sending 3,200 Americaninfantry and airborne troops to Honduras today as ``an emergencydeployment readiness exercise.'' The White House says the actionwas prompted by what it called the invasion of neighboring Hondurasby 1,500 to 2,000 Nicaraguan forces.   The U.S. troops were to be kept 125 miles from the area ofreported hostilities, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.   The last such incident was late in November 1986. Honduras saida Sandinista force of 2,500 soldiers crossed the border in a bid tostall the Contras from mounting a dry-season offensive.   Honduras, which claimed the Sandinistas had moved at least ninemiles deep into the country, responded by having U.S. helicoptersairlift about 3,000 Honduran troops to the area.   There was some small-scale combat between the Sandinistas andHondurans. And the Hondurans bombed and strafed suspectedSandinista positions with French-built Super Mystere and old,U.S.-made A-37 jet fighters.   Nicaragua denied that its troops crossed over, and no casualtyfigures were released.   In late March 1986, U.S. officials said about 1,500 Nicaraguantroops were operating nine miles to 15 miles inside Honduras.   The Sandinista government initially denied the charge, butPresident Daniel Ortega acknowledged border crossings which heclaimed were ``totally defensive operations.''   The week before that incursion, the House had voted 222-210against President Reagan's request for $100 million in aid to theContras. The Senate approved the money four days after theadministration announced the incursion, and an aid package waspassed in August.   At the time of the incursion, Reagan approved $20 million inemergency assistance to the Hondurans, and U.S. helicopters ferriedabout 600 Honduran soldiers to the area from the Palmerola air basewhere the troops were being flown today.   Honduran military sources said 200 Sandinistas were killed, 16captured and others injured during the incursion, which lasted lessthan a week. Forty Contras were reportedly killed.   Other U.S. officials later scaled back their estimate of thenumber of Sandinista troops involved in the border crossing toabout 800.</TEXT></DOC>
