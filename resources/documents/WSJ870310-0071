The corruption charge, which is analogous to a bribery allegation in the U.S., represents one of Britain's most serious statutory offenses and can be brought only with the attorney general's recommendation.    The former banking official, 39-year-old Michael Flawn, was arrested in September on six counts of theft and charged with defrauding Johnson Matthey Bankers.    A police probe has uncovered evidence of possible bribery as well as fraud in the near-collapse of Johnson Matthey in 1984, according to the court documents and sources close to the prosecution.    In the past six weeks, police have arrested three other men -- two of them former bank customers -- on charges of fraud in their dealings with Johnson Matthey Bankers. The two former customers charged were Amjad Imam, a 31-year-old Pakistani businessman, and Ummed Chand Goleccha, a British subject. Rajendra Kumar Choraria, another British subject and purported associate of Mr. Goleccha, also was arrested.    Mr. Flawn couldn't be reached for comment. The other three men, released on bail after surrendering their passports, also couldn't be reached.    Sources close to the government's Department of Public Prosecutions say there may be more arrests before the probe, which began 15 months ago, ends. Mr. Flawn became the first arrest in the investigation when he was charged with theft last September. At that time, the lawyer for the director of public prosecutions said in court that Britain's attorney general had consented to a prosecution of Mr. Flawn on a corruption charge, for allegedly accepting bribes from a JMB customer.    The charges facing the four men are the first to show that fraud may have played a part in the bank's bad debts, equivalent to $397 million. In 1985, the bank reported it had set aside $403.4 million of bad-debt provisions on a loan portfolio totaling only $622.5 million. The bad debts prompted the Bank of England to rescue the bank in October 1984.    Bank customers allegedly offered financial bribes to at least one JMB official in return for favorable loan arrangements, according to sources close to Britain's attorney general. Last year, the central bank sold most of JMB's operations to Westpac Banking Corp. of Australia. The remaining units were renamed Minories Finance Ltd. </TEXT></DOC>
