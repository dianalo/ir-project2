Canadian officials said 17 Soviet diplomats and traderepresentatives in Ottawa and Montreal were either expelled or toldnot to return in cases where they had already left the country.   Mulroney made the disclosure at a final summit news conferencewhen asked about the expulsion by a Canadian Broadcasting Corp.reporter, who sought confirmation that there had been expulsionsfor industrial espionage.   ``I will confirm the government of Canada took some action lastweek in regard to the improper and unacceptable behavior byrepresentatives of the Soviet government in Canada,'' Mulroney said.   He said Canadian security officers presented the government with``rather delicate information'' and ``certain people wereexpelled.''   Foreign Minister Joe Clark will make a statement on the actionin Parliament on Wednesday, Mulroney said.   The Canadian Press news agency, quoting unidentified sources inOttawa, said scientific and technological information was believedto be the Soviets' main target.   The agency said eight of the Soviets have left Canada since theexpulsion. Two of them worked at the Soviet embassy in Ottawa andthe others were based in Montreal with diplomatic status. The othernine Soviets had left Canada in recent months. All were declaredpersona non grata and told they could not return.   Canadian Press said the expulsions appeared to have noconnection with the arrest last week on spying charges of StephenJoseph Ratkai, a Nova Scotian of Hungarian descent. Ratkai wasaccused under Canada's Official Secrets Act with gatheringclassified U.S. military documents from a submarine-trackingstation at Argentia, Newfoundland.   Mulroney said that despite the summit's endorsement of Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, Western leaders were ``underno illusions'' about the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
