Delegate Max Friedersdorf said he hoped the declaration would``contribute both to greater confidence and to the negotiation ofrelated provisions'' of a convention banning the production,stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.   The Geneva conference has been negotiating such a convention for20 years. This year's summer session began July 7.   ``The declaration we are making today is unprecedented,''Friedersdorf told the 40-nation conference.   ``We urge other countries that possess chemical weaponsproduction facilities to declare the locations of their facilitiesand to outline how the facilities would be destroyed,'' he said.   He said no other conference member had provided information onchemical weapons production facilities. The United States andSoviet Union are the only two members of the conference who haveacknowledged possessing chemical weapons.   The United States has said it believes about 15 nations possesssuch weapons, but it has refused to name them.   The production facilities declared by the United States areRocky Mountain Arsenal, in Colorado; the Pine Bluff Arsenal inArkansas; Muscle Shoals in Alabama; Newport Army Ammunition Depotin Indiana; and Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.   The Soviet Union has declared the amount of its stockpiles, butnot their location nor the location of production sites.   The Soviet Union said in December that its chemical weaponsstocks total 50,000 tons, but Western experts have estimated thatthe actual total is much higher.   The United States also submitted to the conference ideas forways to destroy chemical weapons under an eventual ban.   Delegates have drafted many parts of a chemical weapons ban. Themain unresolved issue is how to guard against cheating.</TEXT></DOC>
