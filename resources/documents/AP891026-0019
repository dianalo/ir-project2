The 15 men, many of whom were educated in the West, seek tobridge the gap between the Moscow-style government and theU.S.-backed mujahedeen guerrillas who have been at war for a decade.   Calling themselves the National Salvation Society, they issued amanifesto this month calling for an end to both Soviet and Americaninterference in Afghanistan.   The society's members, most of whom served former King ZahirShah, say they want to unite Afghanistan and start repairing thedamage.   According to their estimates, which are slightly higher thaninformation available to the United Nations, 2 million Afghans havebeen killed and 7 million have fled the country since the 1978Marxist revolution. Of the 15 million Afghans inside and outsidethe country, 95 percent are illiterate and 70 percent of the arableland has been abandoned, they say.   ``We are the group who stayed in Afghanistan during the last 10years,'' said Mohammad Asghar, the society's chairman and a formerjustice minister. ``The destruction has got to such a point that wefelt we would be committing a grave sin if we didn't work forpeace.''   Other members of the group include former agriculture andfinance ministers, a former national police chief and anex-governor of the central bank.   Foreign diplomats say the group has great popular support.Speaking on condition of anonymity, diplomats and an Afghanobserver said the group could develop into a potent political forceif it can stay independent of both the government and themujahedeen, whose name means Islamic holy warriors.   ``But their risks are tremendous,'' one diplomat added.``History has never been kind to moderates.''   The society's manifesto was carried by the government-run pressand radio station on Oct. 7, but the group insists it isindependent of government control.   ``We are a third force,'' said Asghar, who studied philosophyand education at Columbia University in New York. ``Alien powershave changed our free country into an exercise board of theirpolitics as well as a theater of international confrontation.Giving fatal arms and boundless financial support to the warringsides, they add, at every moment, fuel to the flames of war.''   The group's manifesto was significant in that it did notdistinguish between the United States and the Soviet Union. It alsopointedly criticized the Kabul government's centralized economicpolicies and urged the establishment of a free market economy.   Abdul Qudoos Majid, the society's secretary and former deputyminister of mines and industries, said it took 16 days to get thegovernment to agree to publish the manifesto.   ``Where else could we have gone to get our message across?''asked Majid, a graduate of the Colorado School of Mines. ``We alsowent to them because we wanted to test the government's sincerity.''   President Najib has repeatedly asserted that he wants a policyof national reconciliation. He has escalated his call since theSoviet Union withdrew its combat troops in February and ended adecade of direct military intervention in Afghanistan.   All 15 members of the society served in top government postsduring the reign of Zahir Shah, whose four decades on the throneended in 1973 when he was overthrown by his cousin, Mohammad Daoud.Daoud was assassinated in 1978 when the People's Democratic Partyof Afghanistan seized power.   Majid, at 60, is the youngest member of the society, whoseaverage age is 66.   Several have been jailed, including the deputy chairman, formerGen. Abdul Hakim Katawazi, whose fingernails were pulled out duringtorture sessions by Daoud's regime.   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthe government recently asked Katawazi to become minister ofdefense but he refused.   Afghan observers said the government apparently does not opposethe group because it might help lure the 74-year-old Zahir Shahhome from exile in Italy. The king is still a popular figure inAfghanistan, and his return might lend Najib the air of legitimacyhe seeks at home and abroad.   The mujahedeen refuse to negotiate with Najib's government,denouncing it as a Soviet puppet.   The king's return might also fatally fracture the squabblingmujahedeen alliance, a government source noted. The leaders of theseven Pakistan-based mujahedeen groups range from bitteranti-monarchists to former palace advisers who have said they wouldnot oppose the king's return.   However, Asghar denied the National Salvation Society was set upsimply to encourage the king's return.   ``My main problem with the government has always beenideological,'' the 73-year-old scholar and avowed anti-Marxistsaid. ``This whole fight started with the imposition of an aliensystem on Afghanistan which was rejected by our people. We want asystem that is based on our own culture.   ``We also want one that is based on freedom.''</TEXT></DOC>
