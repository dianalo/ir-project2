The Soviet crew, led by correspondent Yevgeny Kiselev, also isto interview Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Foreign Minister MosheArens and Finance Minister Shimon Peres before leaving.   The Soviet Union severed diplomatic relations with Israel as ashow of solidarity with Arab nations following the 1967 Middle Eastwar.   The visit by the television crew is another sign of thawingrelations between the two nations.

In an interview with Israel television on Thursday, Kiselevsaid, ``the intefadeh (Palestinian uprising) is the main story forany TV company working in Jerusalem. But I want to show life inIsrael as well.''   At least 535 Palestinians and 38 Israelis have died in the20-month-old uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip. Ninety-one Arabs have been killed by otherArabs, allegedly because they collaborated with Israel.   In his tour of the West Bank, Kiselev interviewed the militarygovernor of Nablus, Col. Shmuel Morgan, and later spoke to areserve soldier who emigrated from the Soviet Union nine years ago.   Kiselev also visited an Israeli kibbutz, or communal farm, andtoured high technology industries.
