The decision by U.S. District Judge John E. Sprizzo was at oddswith an earlier federal ruling and is the latest interpretation ofthe Warsaw Convention on international air travel.   On Jan. 3, a federal judge in Brooklyn, Thomas Platt, ruled thatthe treaty barred punitive damages for families of passengerskilled in the December 1988 bombing of Pan American Flight 103 overLockerbie, Scotland.   Platt said the Warsaw Convention restricted internationalaviation lawsuits to compensatory damages and limited those damagesto $75,000, unless ``willful misconduct'' was proven.   Sprizzo, however, disagreed. In his decision Thursday, he saidno language in the treaty ``expressly preempts or precludes''punitive claims.   Sprizzo's ruling stemmed from more than 50 lawsuits filed by thefamilies of victims of the hijacking of a Pan Am flight fromBombay, India, to New York on Sept. 5, 1986.   At a scheduled stop in Karachi, Pakistan, four gunmen seized theplane. Twenty passengers were killed and dozens more were injured.   A call to Pan Am for comment was not returned.   Lee A. Kriendler, an attorney representing plaintiffs in boththe Lockerbie and Pakistan lawsuits, said he has asked Platt for arehearing on his ruling in the Lockerbie case. He also sent Platt acopy of Sprizzo's ruling.   In a previous ruling, a federal judge in Washington allowedplaintiffs in the 1983 Korean Airlines disaster to seek punitivedamages from the airline.   That case involved the Soviet shooting down of a KAL planecarrying 269 people. A jury awarded $50 million to about 130families. The award is now under appeal. </TEXT></DOC>
