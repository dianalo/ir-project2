We would likeyour comments about what is now America's hands-off policytoward the Kurdish and Shiite resistance movement againstSaddam Hussein. Do you feel this neutrality has implicationsfor the reliability of U.S. support for democracy movementsin your own country and elsewhere in the world?&quot;                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   LITHUANIA                                                                                                          Vytautas Landsbergis   President of Lithuania                                                                                                          Following the Second World War, Lithuania's armedresistence against the second Soviet occupation continued forabout 10 years. At that time, U.S. Radio stations raised thehopes of the resistance, and all the people of Lithuania,that the Soviets would soon be forced to withdraw. But inreality, the U.S. government maintained the position ofneutrality, even during the terrible years of 1948 and 1949,when hundreds of thousands of Lithuanians were being deportedto Siberia in cattle cars.   We can well understand the present position of the Iraqiresistance, although we can do nothing to help. Those who arein a position to help must choose between calculated measuresand their own conscience, between pragmatism and humaneness.I do not believe that it would have been just, having forcedHitler out of his occupied countries, to have let him remainin control of his own country and to have allowed him tomurder the anti-Nazi resistance or the Jewish population. Ido not believe that ths would have been just even if one oranother ally of Hitler adhering to a doubtful position ofneutrality, such as Franco, had attempted to convince theAllies not to interfere in the internal affairs of the ThirdReich. At that time, humaneness demanded that the fascistinhumanity be destroyed, and the only mistake committed wasthe concession made to another inhuman force -- Sovietcommunism.   This mistake exacted a huge price over 45 years, althoughit is true that, for the most part, this price was paid byothers, just as is happening today in Iraq. But in the end,the greatest final costs may be paid by the West as well.                                                                                                          EL SALVADOR                                                                                                          Mario Rosenthal   Editor of El Salvador News-Gazette                                                                                                          The hands-off policy of the U.S. toward the Kurdish andShiite revolt against Saddam Hussein is not relevant to thereliability of U.S. support for democracy movements in ElSalvador and elsewhere. Latin Americans view America'sdeclarations of non-intervention in the affairs of othernations as sheer demagogy and its avowals of support fordemocracy as sheer hypocrisy. The decisiveness with whichIraqi aggression against Kuwait was crushed was compared withthe tepid and half-hearted assistance lent by the U.S. todefeat the foreign-supported Marxist aggression against ElSalvador, now in its 11th year.   El Salvador is the last place in the world where a U.S.policy of non-intervention in the internal affairs of othernations would be believed. U.S. support for Jose NapoleonDuarte and his party subjected El Salvador to government by acorrupt left-leaning regime that bankrupted the nation andthat legitimized the foreign-supported Marxist insurgency.   The neutrality of the U.S. in the insurrection againstSaddam Hussein's government, even if President Bush did sayhe should be removed, is not condemned here. Neither is itapplauded. There is so little faith in declarations of policyfrom Washington that it is even doubted whether in fact theU.S. is not indirectly assisting the insurrection and willnot make some attempt to remove Saddam, which it willprobably bungle.                                                                                                          AFGHANISTAN                                                                                                          Aziz Naim   Former diplomat and historian at Kabul University who nowedits Afghan Resurrection, a London-based newsletter                                                                                                          President Bush's hands-off policy toward the resistancemovements against Saddam Hussein is not surprising. Similaractions in the past have disillusioned many of us whoregarded the U.S. as the protector of democracy, freedom andprogress.   In Afghanistan, the U.S. was aware that the Soviet Unionwas planning to invade in 1979, according to documentscaptured from the U.S. Embassy in Iran, and yet it didnothing to prevent it. After the invasion, all the U.S. didwas to concede that Afghanistan was in the Soviet &quot;sphere ofinfluence&quot; and tell them to go no farther. Only after theAfghan resistance began to challenge the Soviets did the U.S.begin to supply arms. Even here, however, the arms were --and are -- channeled through Pakistan, which makes us wonderwhether the U.S. is supporting the right of the Afghan peopleto self-determination or trying to play a strategic game.   The Soviets withdrew in February 1989, but the unpopularcommunist regime of President Najib remains in place, and themilitary elements of the Afghan resistance are still at waragainst him. Rumors are flourishing in Pakistan that the U.S.intends to cut off aid; true or not, such a rumor reflectsthe state of mind of many of our people.   We in the Afghan resistance do appreciate the considerableaid the U.S. has given to us. Nevertheless, this questioncomes to mind: By assisting the Afghan resistance, doesAmerica genuinely desire the restoration of an independentAfghanistan with the consent of the Afghan people? Or does itwant the resistance to prolong the civil war in such a manneras to install American proteges in our country?                                                                                                          LATVIA                                                                                                          Janis Jurkans   Foreign Minister                                                                                                          The U.S., with the help of its coalition partners, carriedout the U.N. resolution for liberating Kuwait. There appearsto be no authority for any nation, including the U.S., to actfurther.   The government of the Latvian Republic has always regardedthe U.S. as a firm supporter in its struggle to restoreLatvia's independence. The representatives of the governmenthave been received in the White House on the highest possiblelevel. In the crucial days of January 1991, during the Sovietcrackdown in the Baltics, the reaction of the U.S. helpedprevent further bloodshed.   We are confident that the U.S. government will continuetheir support until the Balts achieve their goal ofindependence in a democratic and peaceful manner.                                                                                                          CHINA                                                                                                          Yan Jiaqi   Founding chairman of the Federation for a DemocraticChina, a Paris-based Chinese dissident organization                                                                                                          Saddam Hussein's killing of Kurdish refugees is similar innature to the Li Peng government's Beijing massacre of June4, 1989. There are no national boundaries where human rightsare concerned. Human rights are not &quot;domestic affairs.&quot;   I have always felt that only political questions can bethe subject of compromise. On matters of human rights, onmatters of justice, there can be no compromise.   The United Nations should involve itself in Iraqi affairs.First: Adopt measures to stop Saddam Hussein from massacringand suppressing the Kurdish people. Second: Give assistanceto the Iraqi refugees. Third: Openly discuss the Kurdishissue, and clearly support &quot;adequate autonomy&quot; for the Kurdswithin the borders of Iraq.                                                                                                          ESTONIA                                                                                                          Lennart Meri   Foreign Minister                                                                                                          U.S. neutrality on the Kurdish question and the resistancemovement against Iraqi oppression has no implicationswhatsoever for the reliability of U.S. support for ademocratic and independent Estonia. The U.S. cannot actunilaterally to prevent the genocide of the Kurds.   The foreign policy of any state is founded on theprotection and advancement of its own national interests. InCentral-Eastern Europe, as in other regions of the world, theU.S. has identified support for democracy andself-determination as synonymous with advancement of the USnational interest. President Bush and the U.S. Congress havewith words and deeds unstintingly supported the struggle ofthe people and government of Estonia for freedom anddemocracy.                                                                                                          HONG KONG                                                                                                          Martin Lee   Chairman of United Democrats of Hong Kong, the colony'slargest political party                                                                                                          There are obviously important differences between thesituations in Iraq and Hong Kong.   We in Hong Kong do not seek independence and we recognizethe resumption of Chinese sovereignty over the territory in1997. We do not seek to bring down the Chinese or Britishgovernments. All we ask is that Hong Kong, as the Chinese andBritish governments promised to us in the 1984 Sino-BritishJoing Declaration, be allowed to have a democratic governmentin line with the policy of &quot;one country, two systems.&quot;   We feel that the British government has betrayed us byreaching an agreement with China after the Tiananmen massacrethat Britain would not allow for the establishment ofdemocratic government in Hong Kong before 1997. The people ofHong Kong have never asked for U.S. intervention. What wewould like is for Hong Kong, now and after 1997, to remain&quot;in the eyes of the world&quot; as Margaret Thatcher put it in1984. The political status of Hong Kong people may be unique,but the yearning of its people for democracy and human rightsis not. The international community should encourage thisyearning for democracy whether it is in Iraq, Burma or HongKong. We cannot afford to have double standards, for if oneperson loses his basic rights, then it is a loss for all ofus.                                                                                                          ANGOLA                                                                                                          Marcos Samondo   Deputy envoy to the U.S. of UNITA, Angola's anti-communistresistance                                                                                                          The fact that the U.S. has not joined in the currentbattle within Iraq cannot be interpreted as a failure tosupport freedom and democracy. It is by no means clear thatthe current rebellion in Iraq is in fact a cohesive strugglefor democracy: Ethnic and religious agendas play heavily inthe fighting.   The U.S. has long been active in supporting democraticmovements in various parts of the world and has been a majorfactor in the positive developments now taking place inAngola. But clearly the U.S. may choose not to involve itselfin every conflict around the world. The U.S. must beselective and must tailor its policies to each specificsituation.                                                                                                          MISKITOS OF NICARAGUA                                                                                                          Armstrong Wiggins   Official adviser to the Miskito Indians on foreign affairs                                                                                                          As a Miskito Indian from Nicaragua, I feel deeply thesuffering of the Kurds. Like American Indians, the Kurds havebeen denied the most basic rights to a homeland and their ownway of life.   In 1970, not long after I first left my Miskito communityto study at the University of Wisconsin, I met a fellowforeign student who was a Kurd. We had much in common. Ournative lands were under the dominion of others. The Kurdswere said to belong to Iraq, Turkey and Iran; my Miskitopeople had been &quot;reincorporated&quot; -- occupied and subjugated-- by Nicaragua and Honduras in the late 19th century, aftergenerations of subjugation under the British and Americans.   Today, in the so-called post-colonial era, a moreenlightened world celebrates the right of all peoples toself-determination. But the Kurds, Miskitos and most otherindigenous peoples are still denied that right.   I have lost touch with my Kurdish friend, and it is verypossible that he has been killed by Saddam Hussein's poisongas, his torture chambers, his execution squads or hismilitary assaults. Only a few years ago, my people too facedthe awesome terror of helicopter gunships. If my Kurdishfriend has survived, I want him to know that my people havesurvived and are beginning to rebuild. He should know thattoday there are many prayers for the survival of the Kurds.   The blame for the extreme suffering of the Kurds fallssquarely on the government of Saddam Hussein. There is goodcause, however, for many others to reflect on thecontributions they have made to this great wrong. Theinternational community has tended to conclude that the Kurdsshould be treated as a national security problem or internalconcern for the government of Iraq to handle as it pleases.Even as the Kurdish leaders repeatedly emphasize that theirstruggle is for autonomy within Iraq, not statehood, they aredismissed as separatists who endanger world peace byjeopardizing the &quot;territorial integrity of Iraq.&quot; Territorialintegrity is indeed at issue, but it is the territory of theKurds that has been violated.                                                                                                          VIETNAM                                                                                                          Pham Huy Ty   Former assistant minister of foreign affairs for theRepublic of South Vietnam                                                                                                          U.S. policy in Iraq disturbs those of us who wish for afree Vietnam: If the U.S. will not help the resistance inIraq, where it has committed American lives and honor, doesthat imply it will now take the easy way out and turn itsback on the democratic resistance in Vietnam?   U.S. economic pressure provoked a split in the communistleadership between those who support reform to rescue themoribund economy and the hardline Marxists who oppose reform.Pressure from abroad has also encouraged Vietnam's democraticresistance and human rights activists to keep up the fight.The next step should be for the U.S. to pressure thecommunist leadership to release political prisoners.   Unfortunately, many influential Americans are now sayingthat the U.S. should recognize the communist regime and beginfull diplomatic relations with Vietnam. This would be amistake, as it would ease the pressure on an oppressivegovernment that is fast losing the support of the populace.   To remain true to itself, the U.S. must maintain itsposition that the communist regime does not represent theVietnamese people. American policy in Iraq is thereforetroubling to those of us campaigning for a democraticVietnam.                                                                                                          HUNGARY                                                                                                          Bela K. Kiralyi   Commander-in-chief of the Hungarian National Guard, thefreedom fighters, in 1956; since 1990, member of Parliamentand colonel-general in the Hungarian army                                                                                                          Coups d'etat or military takeovers can be stage-managed byforeign powers, but genuine revolutions require the supportof a considerable section of the population. Foreign aid maysustain but seldom can initiate them.   If this is true -- I think it is -- it is also true thatevery people that rises in arms against tyranny have tocalculate their chances of success solely on a comparison oftheir own determination and resources and those of thetyrant. Therefore, neither the Kurds nor the Iraqi Shiitesare entitled to receive armed aid. History teaches us thatdecisions of governments are always guided by self-interestrather than by moral standards.   I have a distressing experience of my own in that respect:In 1953, as a prisoner on death row, a news item penetratedthe walls of my solitary confinement. U.S. Secretary of StateJohn Foster Dulles had stated that if and when &quot;a satellitenation liberates itself from under the Soviet yoke, Americanswill never let them be suppressed again.&quot; The Hungarianrevolution of 1956 was tailor-made exactly to fit such apolicy decision. We liberated ourselves, but Sovietaggression suppressed our independence again. Western actiondid not materialize. At the same time, the U.S. forced herown allies, Israel, France and Britain, to cease their attackon Egypt. That was a stark double standard.   I believe unfulfilled promises or hints of help hurt theprestige of governments. People do, however, seem tounderstand the Realpolitik of governments, even when it hurtstheir own interests. But people forget much less fast, or donot forget at all, these applications of double standards ininternational relationships.                                                                                                          TIBET                                                                                                          Lodi Gyari   Special Envoy of the Dalai Lama                                                                                                          We Tibetans understand the suffering of the Kurds. TheTibetan people were in a similar situation in 1959, when amassive uprising against the Chinese occupation of ourcountry was brutally put down by the People's LiberationArmy. In the years that followed, the Chinese took vengeanceon Tibet by systematically annihilating our culture, levelingour monasteries and sending tens of thousands of mycountrymen to their deaths.   It is difficult to understand how the U.S. could lead acoalition to free the people of Kuwait, and then acquiesce inthe annihilation of the Kurds only weeks later. Both theKuwaitis and the Kurds are human beings. Surely is theresponsibility of the international community to come toprotect any people that is being massacred no matter who theymay be or what the legal status of their territory may be.   His Holiness the Dalai Lama steadfastly refuses tocountenance the use of violence to achieve political ends,although I suspect he might change his mind if faced by thesort of trying circumstances the world faced in World War II.What His Holiness the Dalai Lama asks for Tibet appliesequally well for the Kurdish people: &quot;We are not askingother countries to fight a war for the liberation of Tibet.All we ask is for them to speak the truth. We ask them not todistort history and to acknowledge -- as they did in the past-- that Tibet is an occupied country.&quot;                                                                                                          CUBA                                                                                                          Jorge Mas   A 1960 exile from Cuba and chairman, Cuban-AmericanNational Foundation   Observers have called Fidel Castro the &quot;Saddam Hussein ofthe Caribbean,&quot; and with good reason. He is as capable ofruthlessness, as heavily armed, and as brutally repressive asSaddam. During the war in the Gulf, Cuba's diplomatic supportfor Iraq demonstrated once more how internationally isolatedMr. Castro's regime has become.   The 30th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs will beacknowledged, with bitterness and pride, by Cuban-Americanson April 17. Trained and armed by the U.S., Cuban exiles wentto liberate this country. But as we all know, America'scommitments were not kept.   The lesson for the U.S. is clear: Don't get into somethingyou are not willing to see through to completion. The lessonfor Cuban patriots is also clear: The liberation of a countryfrom tyranny is ultimately the responsibility of itscitizens.   America's consideration of whether and how to support anynational resistance movement is always based on calculationsof its national interests. It is clear that President Bushhas thought carefully about the complex internal situation inIraq in the aftermath of the Gulf War. His current actions inno way diminish our perception of his steadfast support forCuba's people.                                                                                                          THE UKRAINE                                                                                                          Ivan Drach   Chairman of Rukh, the Ukrainian popular movement                                                                                                          Every average citizen knows that the U.S. recognized theSoviet Union at a time when the leadership of the Bolshevikwas starving 10 million Ukrainians to death. No moralobjection stopped this recognition then; just as SaddamHussein, who did not dare use chemical weapons againstAmerican soldiers, has not been stopped from using themwithout mercy against Kurdish women and children.   The Kurdish problem is a litmus test for the humanism ofpoliticians. The Ukrainian poet Vassyl Symonenko in the 1960swrote a poem entitled &quot;To My Kurdish Brother,&quot; comparing thestruggle for the liberation of the Ukrainian people with thatof the long-suffering Kurds.   To bomb the serpent of Iraq with such intensity that eventhe cosmos trembled, and then to leave the head of thisserpent so that it may multiply -- does this not elicit thewonderment of people who think with common sense? As it doesto give funds both for the modernization of prisons whileoffering to nourish those who want to tear those prisonsapart. This is the self-deluding policy of the Americangovernment in the so-called Soviet Union.   It is terrible for us in the democratic movements ofEastern Europe to feel that the hand that bandages our woundshas just now given aid to the inflictor of those wounds. Wehave learnt that democratic movements must rely on their ownstrength. To put one's faith in a &quot;good uncle&quot; is not onlymorally irresponsible -- it is also impractical.</TEXT></DOC>
