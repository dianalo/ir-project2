The final federal proposal, handed over to Judge ThomasZilly in Seattle federal court, designates about a third lessland as so-called &quot;critical owl habitat&quot; than some previousproposals, primarily because of administration concerns overthe economic impact of prohibiting logging to save the owl.The owls are in danger of extinction because of heavy loggingin the forests where they nest.</LP><TEXT>   The government first proposed listing more than 11 millionacres as prime owl habitat, and reduced that to 8.2 millionlast fall. Environmentalists criticized the government forfurther scaling back the plan to the 6.8 million acresincluded in the final version, even as logging groups werestill calling the final proposal economically devastating.   The spotted owl has become a symbol of environmentalists'efforts to save the remnants of the nation's virgin forests,which have been reduced by an estimated 98% in the past twocenturies. And the owl issue has become a battleground in theconflict between wildlife preservation and economic growth.   Listing land as critical owl habitat means that theacreage will likely be subject to some logging restrictions,which can range from modest limits on how many trees can becut to a total logging ban. Another Interior Department teamis working on a so-called recovery plan, which will containadditional details of how the logging limits will shake out.   That plan is expected to be complete in February, but itwon't put the matter to rest. The Forest Service is workingon a separate owl plan that must be submitted to a federalcourt in Seattle, which is also hearing a separateowl-related case.   Yet another Interior Department task force, dubbed the&quot;God Squad,&quot; is evaluating whether the government shouldwaive protecting the owl under provisions of the EndangeredSpecies Act because of the potential economic impact of doingso. And additional lawsuits, as well as new initiatives fromCongress and the administration, are likely to keep thecontroversy bubbling throughout the year.</TEXT></DOC>
