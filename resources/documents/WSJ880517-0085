In a highly critical memorandum sent to a senior Army official, Marvin Collins, U.S. attorney in Fort Worth, Texas, charged that the Army repeatedly stood by while Bell Helicopter engaged in dubious billing practices. In addition, he said that Army officials allowed the contractor to destroy some records that might have shown whether the government was being overcharged.    Last March, the Justice Department dropped a three-year criminal investigation of Bell and accepted a $90 million financial settlement in which the contractor didn't admit any wrongdoing. However, Mr. Collins's memorandum makes it clear that government prosecutors entered the agreement largely out of exasperation.    The Army's lax oversight hampered the government's law-enforcement effort in two respects, Mr. Collins said. Because the Army gave its blessing to Bell's billing practices, U.S. prosecutors would have a hard time convincing a jury that the military had been cheated. Also the confused and incomplete accounting records made it practically impossible to identify clear overcharges.    The target of the government attorney's sharpest criticism is the Army's so-called plant representative office, which oversaw Bell's helicopter work day-to-day. According to Mr. Collins, this office in 1980 authorized Bell to destroy a raft of records on helicopters parts it provided the Army. The destruction &quot;severely limited&quot; the investigation and violated federal regulations requiring that the records be maintained, he said.    According to the memo, the Army allowed the contractor to pass on charges to the government based on estimated costs rather than actual ones. Usually, these estimated charges are higher than the actual costs. Although the Army allowed this billing procedure to continue from 1980 till 1985, the Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency insisted that Bell submit bills reflecting actual costs on their contracts with Bell.    Bell's accounting systems -- all reviewed and approved by the Army -- made it impossible for prosecutors to reconstruct a reliable record of what the government had paid for. Mr. Collins said that under the accepted accounting procedures, Bell could &quot;conceal true costs incurred . . . and change costs on their contracts for years after final delivery was accomplished.&quot;    Although the Army's management of Bell's contracts was generally permissive, the Defense Contract Audit Agency &quot;issued numerous audit reports&quot; citing violations by the contractor of Pentagon accounting standards, the prosecutor's memo said. However, the Army office failed to demand compliance with the accounting rules, it added.    When the Army did crack down on Bell, it ran afoul of government rules. Mr. Collins said the Army once withheld payments from Bell, but because the company could show that the service had halted funds improperly, it obtained all the withheld payments plus about $5 million in interest.    The memo was sent to Jay Sculley, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition. Mr. Sculley has ordered a review of the Army office that oversaw the Bell contracts. </TEXT></DOC>
