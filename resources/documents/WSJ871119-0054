Hutton andamp; Co. $125,000 for several alleged commodity law violations, including failure to supervise five Houston brokers accused of misconduct.    Without admitting or denying the allegations, New York-based Hutton settled the administrative case yesterday by agreeing to pay the fine and refrain from any violations of the Commodity Exchange Act in the future, as ordered by the commission.    A Hutton spokesman said, &quot;We're happy to settle the administrative case on terms that are in the best interest of Hutton and the CFTC.&quot; Hutton is a unit of E.F. Hutton Group Inc.    In a 14-count administrative complaint, the commission alleged that two of the brokers, John C. London Jr. and Warren Edmundson, committed fraud, and that the securities firm was liable for their &quot;fraudulent conduct.&quot;    Between March 1983 and March 1984, the commission also said, Hutton and four of its brokers guaranteed customers who were involved in stock-index futures trading that they wouldn't lose more than 25% of their investment. Under commission rules, such a guarantee against loss is illegal. The four brokers were Mr. London, John M. Connally, James Grimsrud and Frederick Mecklenburg, all of Houston.    Messrs. London, Mecklenburg and Edmundson are no longer employed by Hutton, according to a commission official.    In Houston, Mr. Grimsrud was meeting with clients last night and couldn't immediately be reached. No one answered the phone at the residence of Mr. London. Messrs. Connally and Mecklenburg have unpublished home telephone numbers.    Mr. Edmundson, who is now associated with Merrill Lynch in Houston, said he was surprised that the CFTC divulged his name because he is contesting the agency's allegations. &quot;If a case hasn't been brought, it shouldn't be reported,&quot; he said.    Mr. Edmundson added that he was &quot;innocent&quot; because the CFTC's allegations involved &quot;a group action that I was definitely not a part of.&quot;    The commission also charged Hutton with reporting and record keeping violations and with employing an unregistered broker. Mr. Grimsrud was accused of failing to register with the commission. Mr. London was charged with reporting violations.    Without admitting or denying the allegations, all but Mr. Edmundson agreed to comply with orders against any violations in the future. An administrative hearing will be held on the charges against Mr. Edmundson, who didn't reach a settlement with the commission.    Mr. Grimsrud was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine, while Messrs. Connally and Mecklenburg each were fined $5,000. Under his settlement, Mr. London will be barred from trading on any commodity futures market for three years. </TEXT></DOC>
