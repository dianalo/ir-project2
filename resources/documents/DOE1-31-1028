This report provides the results and recommendations forthe research related to the examination of nondestructive evaluationtechniques and measurements of the mechanical properties of deformedsteel plate; Evaluation of computer codes to identify those capable ofperforming a large displacement inelastic analysis; Two 1/5-scale-modeltank cars, representing damaged tank cars that were hydroburst to failure;and Preliminary tests conducted using more interferometry for determiningresidual stresses of rail components. 24 refs., 37 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
