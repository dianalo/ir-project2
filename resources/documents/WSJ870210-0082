Actually, the AV-8B is a refinement of British Aerospace PLC's Harrier, which the Royal Navy effectively employed during the Falklands War. An agreement allows McDonnell Douglas to claim all credit for the plane in U.S. advertising. But air-frame production is shared with British Aerospace on a 60-40 basis. And companies will divide almost evenly the estimated $9 billion in revenue from sales of the AV-8B, or Harrier II as it's called, to the Marines.    The Harrier II represents just one of the many transatlantic collaborations that are revolutionizing the nature of U.S. defense procurement. As defense budgets shrink in real terms and more gaps in U.S. industrial capacity appear, the Pentagon has become increasingly dependent on ready-to-buy, quick-to-field arms from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. The weapons are imported or jointly produced by U.S. partners.    Indeed, the list of Pentagon offshore purchases is lengthening. The Navy, to the dismay of U.S. yards, has placed an order for a new minesweeper design with Italy. The Air Force has bought chemical-proof plane shelters from France and C-23 Sherpa cargo planes from Short Brothers PLC of Britain. The Army is buying 81-mm mortars and 105-mm howitzers from Britain, foxhole-digging equipment from West Germany and a $4.3 billion communications system designed by Thomson-CSF of France.    &quot;In some ground systems, the Europeans have better stuff than we do,&quot; contends Robert Komer, who was the Carter administration's undersecretary of defense for policy and a proponent of the standardization of NATO weaponry.    There's wide support in the U.S. as well as in Western Europe for what NATO calls a &quot;two-way street&quot; in arms procurement. William Howard Taft IV, the deputy defense secretary, says the Pentagon is investing $2.9 billion in joint weapons development with NATO in the next five years. Such pooling could save billions of dollars in NATO budgets if it results in major weapons that the allies can use in common.    &quot;We're trying to get as much bang from the German mark as well as from our own bucks,&quot; Mr. Taft says.    Sen. Sam Nunn (D. Ga.), who has long pressed for NATO defense cooperation, is now chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and in a stronger position to translate that goal into legislation. &quot;We'll support whatever the administration asks for along those lines, or perhaps even more,&quot; says committee staff director Arnold Punaro.    In fiscal 1985, the latest year for which the agency has records of this kind, U.S. defense purchases from other NATO members reached $2.8 billion, up 33% from the year before and up 65% from fiscal 1982.    The Navy figures it saved about $600 million by ordering $4.5 billion of off-the-shelf jet trainers from the McDonnell Douglas-British Aerospace partnership rather than developing one of the designs submitted by General Dynamics Corp., Northrop Corp. and Grumman Corp.    Other Pentagon orders have gone overseas in the absence of an equivalent U.S. product. &quot;We needed a small cargo plane that could fly spare engines from one European base to another,&quot; an Air Force spokesman explains. &quot;The British and the Spaniards were the only bidders.&quot;    Some of the offshore purchases are a belated consequence of the Vietnam War. While the Pentagon was skimping on weapons research during the conflict, less distracted Europeans were pouring money into it.    The Army, for instance, couldn't find the money to develop a new light howitzer for nearly 20 years. When it needed one for its new light infantry that could be rushed to crisis spots, it had no choice but to buy the British gun, which shoots farther and weighs less than its old 105-mm weapons.    &quot;We're just plucking the fruits of the seeds planted 15 years ago,&quot; says Francois Heisbourg, a Thomson-CSF executive. He warns, though, that the tide could turn again in another five to 10 years if European governments don't catch up with the U.S. spending during the early Reagan years.    The economic pressures encouraging a more balanced transatlantic defense trade are compelling vendors to team up. &quot;There are literally hundreds of U.S.-European partnerships being formed,&quot; observes Mr. Komer. &quot;We don't know about many of them because things are happening so fast.&quot;    Apart from its partnership with GTE Corp. for the Army communications system, Thomson-CSF is paired with Honeywell Corp. on a 120-mm smoothbore mortar project and with General Dynamics for one component of the Army's next big purchase, an $11 billion array of short-range antiaircraft weapons. In the competition for another part of that system, the team of British Aerospace and United Technologies Corp.'s Norden Systems Inc. unit is a step ahead of other bidders because it has a war-proven missile system ready to go off the assembly line.    One partnership that comes close to being the Pentagon's model is a four-country project called the Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS. Engineers from the U.S., Britain, West Germany and France joined forces at the Army's Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Ala., to produce a devastating artillery weapon that the Soviets are still trying to match.    There are limits to how much the balance of defense trade could shift to the rest of the alliance. Although some buy-American rules are being bent, the bulk of an order for a foreign-designed weapon must be produced domestically. For instance, some 75% of the GTE-Thomson telephone system will have to be supplied by U.S. plants. Most of the British 81-mm mortars to be acquired by the Army will be produced by its own Watervliet arsenal in upstate New York.    Charles Serre, a former French defense attache who now runs a Washington-based association of French arms sellers, believes American pride would never allow the Pentagon to buy its main weapons like jet fighters, attack helicopters or main battle tanks from other countries. &quot;We were too late getting at joint programs for fighters or tanks,&quot; Mr. Taft concedes. &quot;But we could still share work for other projects like standoff missiles and advanced sea mines.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
