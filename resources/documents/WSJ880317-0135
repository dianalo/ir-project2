As previously reported, Stamford, Conn.-based Moore McCormack said it's considering a financial restructuring, recapitalization or leveraged buy-out. The energy and construction materials concern has rejected as inadequate Houston-based Southdown's $35-a-share offer, which has a total indicated value of $450 million, including certain other Moore McCormack securities.    At the hearing next week in federal court here, Southdown is expected to ask the judge to nullify Moore McCormack's anti-takeover measures and to prohibit any moves by the company or its chairman, Paul R. Tregurtha, to block the offer. Southdown has also charged that Moore McCormack has released &quot;materially false and misleading&quot; information and &quot;unlawfully manipulated the market price for Moore McCormack stock.&quot;    Southdown also announced it has extended the expiration of its tender offer to 12:01 a.m. EST March 26 from 12:01 a.m. EST March 24.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Moore McCormack's shares closed at $37.375, up 37.5 cents; Southdown closed at $40.25, down 25 cents.    Southdown says it has $686 million &quot;fully committed&quot; in financing for the all-cash tender offer.    Earlier yesterday, Moore McCormack said its directors will meet Tuesday to consider previously outlined alternatives to Southdown's hostile bid.    Moore also reiterated that its board is actively considering a financial restructuring that would include a substantial dividend of cash and debt, as well as exploring with third parties the feasibility of an acquisition of the company, possibly through a leveraged buy-out.    Moore McCormack officials weren't available for comment on the court's action in Houston.    With both companies having interests in construction materials and energy, Southdown has said it is seeking to create a &quot;premier&quot; cement company in a highly fragmented industry. </TEXT></DOC>
