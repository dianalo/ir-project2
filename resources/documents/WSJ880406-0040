In his decision, Judge David V. Kenyon said the former employees, Michael A. Hyatt and John King, failed to satisfy provisions of a federal law that requires &quot;whistleblowers&quot; to disclose information the government isn't already aware of. The law, known as the False Claims Act, allows private citizens to sue government contractors for fraud and to share in any monetary damages recovered.    Messrs. Hyatt and King claimed in their October 1986 suit that Northrop falsified test data on the MX equipment. However, their claim &quot;is substantially based on evidence or information known by the government since 1985,&quot; Judge Kenyon said. In an action unrelated to the Hyatt and King suit, the Justice Department last August sued Northrop for allegedly falsifying the test data and asked for $1 million in damages.    Judge Kenyon also dismissed the former employees' claims that Northrop was using defective computer circuitry on the MX equipment. Altogether, Mr. Hyatt, a former Northrop engineer, and Mr. King, a former company stock clerk, had sought $150 million in damages. Neither could be reached for comment.    Judge Kenyon's decision was based on a motion filed by the Justice Department, which declined to join the employees' case and sought dismissal. &quot;The decisions, first by the government and now by the court, speak for themselves,&quot; a Northrop spokesman said.    Two separate False Claims Act suits are pending against Northrop by at least five current and former employees. The suits were filed under seal, but certain employees have claimed in congressional testimony and press and television interviews that Northrop set up &quot;dummy&quot; companies to buy parts outside its own procurement system and threw out duplicate parts that belonged to the Air Force. Certain of the individual employees have given testimony to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles.    The two suits were filed last fall under an amended version of the False Claims Act that doesn't require employees to bring &quot;new&quot; information to the government.    &quot;We don't know anything about those (suits) because they were filed under seal,&quot; a Northrop spokesman said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Northrop shares closed at $29.625, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
