 Their roleis to help managers gather facts about the internal operation of theorganization as well as about competitors and external events.andP;  The toolspermit managers and analysts to build detailed financial models, analyzethese models and use this information to make decisions.andM;DSS tools are typically used by financial analysts, business managers, budgetmanagers, product managers and brand managers.andP;  They support sophisticatedfinancial-analysis functions, including exploratory data analysis,time-series analysis, forecasting, causal models, cross-sectional analysisand advanced analytical tools.andM;DSS products should provide the analyst with the facilities necessary tofully implement a DSS application.andP;  The particular type of application andthe individual users determine the mix and depth of the facilities requiredin a single product.andP;  The available DSS products vary widely in terms offacilities.andM;The required features of a DSS data manager are different from those of aproduction database-management system.andP;  Very often a DSS application usesmore than one type of data, and the types of data in an application tend tochange over time.andM;As a result, the data-management facilities of a DSS tool must be veryrobust.andP;  For some applications, a two-dimensional spreadsheet is adequate.andO;But to manage both time-series and cross-sectional data simultaneously, manyDSS products incorporate a multidimensional data manager that allows the userto manage both types of data and view or analyze the data across anydimension or combination of dimensions.andM;In addition, these products provide facilities for performing consolidationsalong any dimension and to analyze or report specific user views.andM;To correctly manipulate the data, the DSS must maintain the associationsbetween data elements, referred to as the data model.andP;  Many of the mainframeDSS products provide automatic navigation tools that ensure that theintegrity of the data is maintained, usually through the use of an activedictionary that controls all access to the physical database.andM;A criticism of spreadsheets, such as Lotus 1-2-3, has been that they do notuse a data dictionary.andP;  This can lead to data disintegration: A user couldeasily operate on monthly information as if it were quarterly data.andP;  Microproducts such as Javelin and pcExpress incorporate an understanding ofbusiness operations and planning and provide data dictionaries that governaccess to the data.andM;A DSS tool must be able to manage the diverse types of data and providedata-entry and editing capabilities.andP;  To do so, the data must first be loadedinto the DSS data manager, as illustrated.andP;  Data for a DSS applicationgenerally comes from many internal and external sources, some of which arenot machine readable.andM;The facilities incorporated in DSS products to handle these diverse types ofdata vary greatly.andP;  Micro spreadsheet products allow the user to import datafrom other spreadsheets, from standard databases (such as dBASE III) or text.andO;These products generally do not provide data screening, error checking,checkpoint/restart or audit facilities or tools for user-defined menus,forms, screen painters or edit checking.andM;Because of their origins, mainframe DSS products do not have the samelimitations as the spreadsheet products in the area of data entry andediting.andP;  Most mainframe DSS products provide some sort of standard filedefinition and input mechanism, and many are able to directly read externaldatabases such as DB2, SQL/DS, IMS and Focus.andM;Perhaps the single most important facility with any DSS product is anintegrated query language that is flexible enough to allow the user tospecify simple, unstructured requests.andP;  These requests tie in directly to thedata dictionary (if there is one) to ensure that the query is processedcorrectly.andM;Virtually all DSS products provide some degree of report-generationcapability, but perhaps more important is the ability to generate graphs.andO;The actual process of graphical analysis can itself provide a differentinsight into reported data and can act as a data-reduction mechanism forquick assimilation of information.andP;  These advantages have made graphics a keyingredient of DSS and EIS applications.andM;With the growing acceptance of the microcomputer as a DSS workstation,graphics are also being used more frequently as a dominant user interface.andO;Using a touch-screen or pointing device, the analyst enters responses withoutusing the keyboard.andP;  By pointing to an icon or an entry in a list, the usercan control the operations of the system.andP;  The continued acceptance ofgraphical interface standards, such as the OS/2 Presentation Manager, GEM orTopview, will enable more products to provide such interfaces.andM;Unfortunately, the field of decision support has commonly been equated withfinancial modeling or financial analysis.andP;  In financial analysis, the usergenerally manipulates data using a series of mathematical operations andbuilt-in financial functions (such as internal rate of return, present value,payback and growth rate) to better understand the relationships between thedata.andP;  A financial model allows the user to consistently representrelationships between data elements.andM;While almost all DSS products have financial analysis and modelingfacilities, the implementation of the modeling languages differs greatly.andM;The simplest implementation of a financial model allows the user to develop amodel in the form of a financial report.andP;  The financial report becomes theuser's view of the financial model.andP;  More robust modeling languages allow theuser to reference data views not contained in the final report.andM;Procedural logic, such as ''if-then-else'' or ''do while,'' can be specifiedas part of a data relationship.andP;  Also, more robust DSS products havefacilities for multilevel consolidations and the automatic conversion ofcurrency data using different exchange rates.andM;One component in the DSS architecture that varies the most from product toproduct is the statistical library.andP;  Statistical functions available in DSSproducts range from simple mathematical functions (square root, absolutevalue, minimum, maximum and so on) and simple descriptive statistics (mean,median, percentile and so on) to simple correlation and regression,time-series projections, cross-sectional analysis and forecasting routines.andM;A robust DSS product provides the developer with alternative ways to interactwith an application.andP;  Ideally, user interaction should be controlled by theuse of a mouse or some other pointing device.andP;  Another common method ofinteraction is natural English.andM;Vendors now provide various levels of support for mainframe and microintegration.andP;  The continued acceptance of the micro as a user workstation hasencouraged mainframe DSS vendors to implement their products in the microenvironment and provide communication capabilities to the mainframe product.andO;Vendors of micro products are also including facilities for connecting tomainframes and for data transfers between the mainframe and popular microproducts.andM;Next week I'll begin a series of articles on IBM's AS/400 family of midrangecomputers as a strategically vital element of IBM's Systems ApplicationArchitecture for implementing the distributed systems of the '90s.andM;----------The James Martin Productivity Series, an information service updatedquarterly, is available through High Productivity Software Inc., ofMarblehead, Mass.andP;
