Tim Drake, director of the National Gay and Lesbian TaskForce's Military Freedom Initiative, said his office has beencontacted by five soldiers who were discharged after servingin the Persian Gulf and two who currently are facingdischarge procedures. He said one case involved a Marine who,before being sent to the Gulf, was under investigation forbeing gay. In each case, the discharge proceedings &quot;beganafter the cessation of hostilities,&quot; Mr. Drake said.</LP><TEXT>   A spokesman for the Department of Defense said he didn'tknow how many Persian Gulf veterans have been discharged forhomosexuality. He added that during the war, the military'spolicy of discharging gay soldiers didn't change. &quot;Anyonefound to be homosexual will be separated from the militaryservice,&quot; he said.   The discharges are likely to add fuel to the controversyover gays in the military, in part because the Army appearsto have permitted gay soldiers to remain in the serviceduring the war, despite the ban.   A portion of the Army's &quot;Commanders Handbook&quot; circulatedlast August said that once a reserve unit has been put on&quot;alert notification,&quot; no discharges for homosexuality wouldbe authorized. A unit can be sent overseas from 10 days toabout two months after being put on alert notification, anArmy spokesman said.   The handbook, in a section on &quot;personnel actions duringthe mobilization process,&quot; said that in cases ofhomosexuality, &quot;if discharge isn't requested prior to theunit's receipt of alert notification, discharge isn'tauthorized. Member will enter AD {active duty} with theunit.&quot;   The document was obtained by attorneys for Joseph Steffan,who was kicked out of the U.S. Naval Academy for saying hewas gay. Mr. Steffan is suing the military, claiming that itsban on homosexuals is unconstitutional. In federal court inWashington today, Mr. Steffan's attorneys plan to ask thefederal judge overseeing that case to order the military toprovide more information about the document and its policyduring the Persian Gulf War.   Earlier this year, several reservists claimed that aftertelling their commanding officers they were homosexual, theywere told that they would be sent to the Persian Gulf butdischarged upon their return. Attorneys contacted by thosegay and lesbian reservists said most of them wanted to servein the Gulf, but didn't want to be kicked out later if theirsexuality was discovered. None of those reservists has beendischarged so far.   Of the Persian Gulf discharges reported so far, none hasinvolved soldiers or reservists who told their commandersthey were gay before being sent to serve in the war. Themilitary has said that it didn't deploy any soldiers to thePersian Gulf that it knew were gay.   The military spokesman said the information in thehandbook, which was meant to be a quick reference forcommanders, doesn't contradict the military's policy banninghomosexuals. He said the passage shouldn't be read &quot;to inferthat the military condones homosexuality.&quot; Rather, he said,claiming to be homosexual &quot;can't be used as an excuse not tobe put on active duty.&quot;   The Defense Department maintains that homosexuality is&quot;incompatible with military service.&quot; The military says thatthe ban is necessary to maintain discipline and good moraleamong the troops, and that homosexuals are more susceptibleto being blackmailed.   Mr. Drake said the soldiers who have contacted his officeall received general discharges. In most cases, thedischarges came after the soldiers were told they could facea court martial, which can carry a criminal penalty.   ---   CRIMINAL CHARGES dismissed against lawyer who advised onwaste disposal.   A San Francisco attorney and his law firm will not beprosecuted for allegedly causing a client to improperlydispose of hazardous waste. William Scherer and his firm,Sullivan, Roche andamp; Johnson, had been charged with abettingillegal disposal by writing a letter announcing theirclient's intent to abandon toxic waste at a laboratory it hadonce used. But a municipal court judge ruled Friday that evenif all charges against Mr. Scherer and the firm were true,they would not provide grounds for criminal charges.   The decision deals a blow to California prosecutors, whohad used the case to introduce a strategy for allocatingliability in hazardous-waste cases. The charges against Mr.Scherer had marked the first attempt to hold a lawyerresponsible for environmental crimes allegedly committed byhis client.   Solano County's deputy district attorney, Mark Pollock,said he will appeal the decision.   The defense had argued that attorneys should not beprosecuted for their clients' crimes because &quot;they cancounsel, but they cannot command,&quot; said Lawrence Callaghan,who represented the firm.   The criminal charges &quot;certainly frightened some lawyersbecause a case like this had never been brought in court,&quot;said John Barg, an attorney for Mr. Scherer. &quot;They ought tobe able to take some comfort in the judge's decision,&quot; thoughit doesn't carry precedentsetting value, Mr. Barg added.   ---   DREXEL TO PAY $8.2 MILLION to settle securities cases with42 states.   Some of the states are seeking additional fines, which areexpected to be opposed by Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.State regulators also have barred the company from resumingits brokerage business in some states. The settlements withthe states and with Puerto Rico were reached in the past fewmonths; the latest, a $1 million settlement with New Jersey,was approved by the bankruptcy court in Manhattan last month.   Drexel, which filed for bankruptcy-law protection inFebruary 1990, recently announced a settlement with itscreditors and securities-litigation claimants.   A hearing on the pact, which divvies up Drexel's $2.5billion in assets, is scheduled for Aug. 9 before U.S.District Judge Milton Pollack in Manhattan.   ---   CLIENT CONFLICTS force FDIC to call on Tennessee firm forTexas litigation.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. interviewed 60 Texaslaw firms in its quest for outside counsel to handle suitsagainst the former officers and directors of FirstRepublicBank Corp.'s failed Dallas and Houston banks, an FDICspokeswoman said.   But the litigation would have posed a conflict of interestfor all of the Texas firms, either because they hadrepresented the banks at one time or because they hadrepresented directors, who include some of Texas's mostprominent executives.   That's why the two suits, filed last week in federalcourts in Dallas and Houston, were drafted by Miller andamp;Martin, a 55-lawyer, general-practice law firm based inChattanooga, Tenn.   Miller andamp; Martin brings 15 years of FDIC litigationexperience to the counsel table. The firm began representingthe FDIC in 1976 after the failure of Hamilton National Bankof Chattanooga and has handled much of the litigation arisingfrom the failures of the Butcher brothers' Tennessee bankingempire.</TEXT></DOC>
