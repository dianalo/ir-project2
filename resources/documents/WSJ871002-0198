In recent years, many pipelines have contracted to buy more gas from producers than they have been able to sell and have been trying to recover the cost of breaking the contracts. The commission's practice has been to allow pipelines to pass on the costs only through surcharges on the price of gas.    A majority of the commissioners approved an agreement between the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. unit of Transco Energy Co. and its customers. The vote allows Transco to directly charge past customers half of the $460 million cost of its settlements.    Commissioners also discussed a draft policy statement endorsing similar allocations of the settlement costs. The commission is expected to approve the draft next week as a guide to how the panel will deal with such cases.    Commission Chairwoman Martha Hesse said she hopes the policy will encourage more pipelines to settle their liabilities to producers. &quot;It is vitally important that we get this problem behind us so that the industry can continue to move toward being truly market responsive,&quot; she said.    Most of the pipelines' customers are distribution companies that sell the gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers. Commissioners said it was unclear whether state regulators would be required to approve passing through the full cost from local distribution companies to their customers.    Pipelines say they have accumulated obligations to pay about $14 billion to producers for gas that they reserved but cannot sell. These &quot;take or pay&quot; costs have built up since 1982 largely because pipelines lost sales to competition from relatively cheap supplies of oil and natural gas sold directly by producers to users.    Typically, such obligations so exceed pipelines' ability to pay that they are being settled for about 10 cents on the dollar. Some pipelines want to bill customers directly for their buyout costs because they figure that if they add steep costs into their gas price they will lose sales.    In approving the Transco settlement with some modifications, the commission certified the big pipeline company to ship gas for users that buy directly from producers. The commission hopes that resolution of take-or-pay problems will encourage more pipelines to participate in that program, which is intended to produce a more competitive market in natural gas.    Lawrence Paulsen, a spokesman for the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, said the group hasn't seen enough detail on the commission's policy statement to comment on it. But he said &quot;we're very pleased that they're focusing on&quot; ways to pass through costs of settlements with producers. </TEXT></DOC>
