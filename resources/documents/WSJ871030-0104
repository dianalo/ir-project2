But on October weekend evenings, all that changes. The streets, dimly lit through the man-made fog, fill up with eerie forms lurking in the shadows or behind huge cobwebs. An alien being with the head of an insect leaps out at you, screaming bloody murder. A mutant creature, one eye dangling from the socket, suddenly thrusts its horrible face in yours and snarls.    Seeking refuge within the confines of the harmless-sounding Jeffries Barn, you discover it has been transformed into a pitch-black maze. As you feel your way along the walls, the threads of a spider web rake your hair from above. But even as you brush away that distraction, there materializes before you a maniac brandishing a bloody knife.    For the 15th year, this park -- renamed &quot;Knott's Scary Farm&quot; for the season -- has its Halloween Haunt under way. The three-weekend run ends this weekend (see schedule of this and selected similar events in other places below).    And if you think the stock market has provided scare enough for people, think again. Once more this year Knott's is drawing sellout crowds that will total more than 100,000 for the seven nights, producing nearly $2 million in gate receipts.    At most theme parks, Halloween scares the owners instead of the customers. For them, the holiday brings with it the real specter of vandalism. &quot;There's definite fear about crowd control,&quot; says Ray Canady, chairman of the marketing committee of the International Association of Amusement Parks and an official of Silver Dollar City in Branson, Mo. &quot;You might attract the wrong kind of people.&quot;    At Knott's, however, they're not spooked by Halloween. Park spokesman Stuart Zanville estimates that the park has pumped at least $3 million into the Scary Farm promotion over the years. It has hired 250 &quot;extras&quot; who invent their own monstrous personae and audition for the jobs. Knott's outfits 400 employees with costumes, including elaborate latex masks, and hires a makeup man to put on the final horrific touches.    Knott's also takes steps to prevent disruptive hooliganism. The main one, which bothers some patrons, is an outright ban on costumes for parkgoers. &quot;We tell people that the park is in costume, not the guests,&quot; says Mr. Zanville. But the real reason, of course, is to ensure that Knott's knows just who is doing the scaring.    The policy basically works. A tear-gas canister disrupted a ride several years ago, and led the park to beef up security with metal-detecting devices and spotchecks of bags at entrances. But all that goes largely unnoticed as the crowds plunk down their $17.95 and stroll beneath the huge inflatable spider that guards the park's main entrance.    Nine of every 10 Haunt attendees are between 14 and 25 years old. Still, a staunch group of older folks has become Scary Farm aficionados. My wife and I, for two, are back again this year to have the wits frightened out of us.    Knott's redesigns much of the sprawling park for the occasion, adding macabre themes for its rides, shows and other attractions. Last year's singing and dancing appearance by television's buxom Valley Girl vampire, &quot;Elvira, Mistress of the Dark,&quot; was a particular hit.    But the real thrill of the Haunt each year is having your nerves tested as a paying &quot;victim&quot; in a nightmarish evening of participatory theater. Various vampires and zombies accosted my wife and me. The park draws the line at spooking in restrooms as well as using devil worship and &quot;excessive acts of violence&quot; as themes, Mr. Zanville says. The results of violent acts, however, are much in evidence. As teen-oriented horror movies such as the &quot;Halloween&quot; series have become more graphic in their gore, gruesome scenes have also become standard Scary Farm fare.    This year, it seems, dismemberment is &quot;in.&quot; Satirical singer &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, playing a demented surgeon on stage, cuts a lady in half on the operating table with a chain saw. And on the &quot;Haunted Dinosaurs&quot; ride that has replaced the normally tame Berry Farm &quot;Kingdom of the Dinosaurs&quot; ride, our car takes us past visions of giant reptiles munching on severed human limbs. As always at this season, grotesque characters jump out to menace us at nearly every turn of the ride, shaking loud noisemakers.    Park employees are forbidden to make physical contact with customers, but even without being touched, a normally secure adult can end up satisfyingly frightened.    For Knott's, all this mock phantasmagoria produces real, soothing profits. Although the company is privately held and doesn't release income figures, it does confide that fully 10% of its annual profit comes from those few nights when it is the Scary Farm.    This tantalizes competing Southern California park operators, despite their wariness of Halloween. Disneyland, Knott's bigger neighbor here in Orange County southeast of Los Angeles, is working on a plan to redesign itself for a &quot;kind-of-scary weekend,&quot; perhaps for next year. The Universal Studio Tour attraction near Los Angeles, which experimented with a twonight event last fall as a variation on its standard program, is also planning a Halloween promotion for 1988.    But Magic Mountain, a large theme park to the north of Los Angeles, has learned that it's hard to divert crowds from a well-established competitor. Magic Mountain canceled its Halloween activities after last year's, shipping its costumes to its AstroWorld Six Flags sister park in Houston.    A Magic Mountain official, who asks for anonymity, says managers of her park are &quot;pretty jealous of what Knott's does.&quot; She adds, &quot;I go down there every year myself.&quot;    ---   Weekend Schedule for Major Theme Park Halloween Attractions:    Knott's Berry Farm &quot;Halloween Haunt,&quot; Buena Park, Calif. -- tonight (Oct. 30), 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.; Halloween, 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.; Sunday, 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. Price: $17.95.
