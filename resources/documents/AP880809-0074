State-run radio said at least 36 people died.   A U.S. official in Washington said witnesses reported seeingdemonstrators carrying bodies of dead protesters over their headsas they marched through the streets of Rangoon, the Burmese capital.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said reportsfrom Rangoon put casualties in today's demonstrations in ``thehundreds,'' but said it would take time for information to besorted out.   A Rangoon-based Western diplomat said he had ``fairly credible''reports of more than 100 people killed as students, monks andothers confronted soldiers who had been moved into the city sincemartial law was declared last week.   State-owned Rangoon radio said authorities clamped an 8p.m.-to-4 a.m. curfew on the capital and banned gatherings of morethan five people.   The radio said five people were killed and 55 wounded inRangoon, while 31 people were killed and 37 wounded in the centraltown of Sagaing. The Sagaing protest broke out as 5,000demonstrators tried to seize the police station.   The radio said 1,451 ``looters and disturbance makers'' had beenarrested. It was unclear whether the figure included more than 800people the radio previously said had been arrested.   The broadcast listed a total of 26 areas, not including Rangoon,where demonstrations were held today. It also said schoolsthroughout the country, including elementary schools, were closedindefinitely. All universities were ordered shut following riotslast June.   Some foreign offices, including the U.S. Embassy, closed theirdoors today and Burmese consulates in some Asian cities stoppedissuing entry visas to tourists.   ``It was a game of cat and mouse. The army was chasing,'' saidJames Cole, a 27-year-old Australian architect who arrived inBangkok today. He said he saw up to 600 soldiers, some armed withmachine guns, at Shwedagon Pagoda, a site of anti-governmentprotests.   Cole said parts of the city were cordoned off with barricadesand roadblocks were manned by soldiers. On a drive from Mandalay toRangoon, he said he saw six armored cars and up to 20 trucks loadedwith troops heading for the capital.   ``They appeared nervous but ready for some sort of trouble,'' hesaid.   The demonstrations are by far the largest show ofanti-government sentiment since democracy was toppled in theSoutheast Asian nation in 1962.   ``This is a tragedy. Our reports say the crowds have been veryconciliatory (towards the security forces),'' one diplomat saidtoday. ``Things are going from bad to worse.''   Radio Rangoon reported mass demonstrations Monday in areasranging from Moulmein on the southern coast to Taunggyi in themountainous area of the Shan States. It said security forces killedfour people and wounded 12 in Mandalay and the same number ofcasualties were inflicted in Mergui on the southern coast during``violent incidents.''   Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported from Rangoon that 30,000people took part in Monday's protests in the capital, while morethan 10,000 students, monks and others demonstrated in Mandalay,Burma's second-largest city.   Students have been at the forefront of protest against SeinLwin, whom they blame for ordering the suppression ofdemonstrations in Rangoon last March and June in which more than100 people were killed by unofficial count.   Sein Lwin was named president and chairman of Burma's rulingparty last month and soon after ordered the arrests of the mostoutspoken critic of the authoritarian government, former Brig. Gen.Aung Gyi, other dissidents and Associated Press correspondent SeinWin.   Rangoon-based diplomats link government price increases,hoarding of food and other economic hardships to the generaltension in the country. Burma's economy suffered greatly under theisolationist policies of Ne Win. Inflation is soaring and thecountry has a foreign debt of $4 billion.   Over the past year, conditions have worsened and Burma _ with anannual per capita income of less than $200. Since the fall, therehave been anti-government demonstrations in virtually every cityand town.   In Bangkok and Hong Kong, Burmese consular officials said theyhad been ordered by Rangoon to indefinitely stop issuing touristvisas to Burma, but the consulate in Tokyo said it was continuingto process them. Officials said businessmen could still apply forspecial visas.   In recent weeks, Burmese embassies around the world have triedto screen out journalists applying under tourist visas. TheAssociated Press has been unable to enter the country.</TEXT></DOC>
