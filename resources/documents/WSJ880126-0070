The administration hopes to win the Senate's blessing for the pact, which would ban missiles with ranges of 315 to 3,125 miles, before the expected superpower summit in Moscow in late May or June. However, although ratification is assured, the debate could drag on longer, with lawmakers from both parties pushing terms and conditions that would advance their own defense policies or presidential candidacies.    Meanwhile, the Pentagon is endorsing the treaty, known as INF, but calling for new weapons projects to assure Europe's security after the U.S. withdraws its intermediate missiles from the Continent.    Senior Reagan administration officials, appearing before two congressional committees, praised the treaty. Their major objective is to fend off congressional amendments and conditions that would require them to renegotiate the pact with the Soviets.    Secretary of State George Shultz, in a 48-page statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, praised the treaty's provisions for verifying that each side complies with its terms, and he noted that the pact would remove far more Soviet weapons than U.S. ones.    Mr. Shultz said the treaty could open a new era of arms reductions. &quot;In short, the treaty is an achievement, as our allies proclaimed in December, without precedent in the history of arms control,&quot; he said.    Each side would have three years after ratification to eliminate its shorter and intermediate-range missiles. The missiles that would be eliminated account for about 4% of the two countries' nuclear arsenals.    Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the treaty would have military benefits for the U.S. &quot;The Soviets agree to give up missiles capable of carrying over 1,600 deployed warheads, as opposed to about 400 for the U.S.,&quot; he said.    At the same hearing, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said the asymmetrical reductions are &quot;an important precedent for future negotiations on both the strategic nuclear and conventional fields.&quot;    However, the political flavor of the ratification debate was set early by Robert Dole, Senate minority leader and presidential contender, who endorsed the treaty. &quot;I placed a call to Margaret Thatcher,&quot; said the Kansas Republican. &quot;I didn't know whether she would take the call, but apparently she had seen the Iowa polls, and I had a good visit with Margaret Thatcher; and a good visit with Helmut Kohl.&quot; He added: &quot;Our allies were fully on board.&quot;    Meanwhile, some Democrats, trying to make sure that Republicans aren't the only ones to gain from the treaty's eventual approval, are using the debate to advance their own arms control philosophies. Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) appears to be using the INF debate as a way to finish his successful fight against the Reagan administration's push to reinterpret the 1972 ABM treaty; he has exacted a promise from the administration that it won't attempt later to alter the interpretation of this pact.    And Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.) wants to define a broad arms control agenda for the future during the course of the ratification debate.    Amid sharp cuts in its spending plans, the Pentagon is making the point that elimination of nuclear systems highlights the need to improve the allies' conventional arsenal. At yesterday's hearing, Adm. Crowe pushed for advanced anti-tank weapons, new highly accurate missiles and improved defenses against short-range missiles to deploy in Germany. </TEXT></DOC>
