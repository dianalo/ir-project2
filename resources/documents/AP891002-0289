(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chip Hutton has retired from a 27-year Navycareer that included the command of two ships, but he's stillgiving plenty of orders.   ``You can't do anything now but sit in your seat.''   ``I want everything off the desk.''   ``Listen to me. If you're not listening, you're not going to dowell.''   The orders are directed at fourth- and fifth-graders atLarchmont Elementary School. Hutton, 50, became their teacher thisyear after completing an Old Dominion University program thatoffers a master's degree and teaching certification to retiringmilitary personnel.   ``I believe that I can help these kids,'' the former Navycommander said of his 16 students, all of whom have failed a gradeand have difficulty learning.   Between commanding a destroyer and a salvage ship, Hutton spentmuch of his career teaching ROTC courses. Fed up withadministrative work, he chose his new career because it lets himwork with a small number of students all day long.   Hutton is one of the first graduates of the Old Dominionprogram, which has attracted 162 military personnel nearingretirement. All but four are men.   Robert H. MacDonald, professor of educational curriculum andinstruction at Old Dominion, has no trouble recruiting students orfinding schools for them.   ``The school divisions are calling and asking for these guys,''said McDonald. Their military backgrounds make them good planners,counselors and negotiators, and ``all those are teacher skills.They also bring to education just extensive life experiences.''   MacDonald has found the retired officers are no moreauthoritarian than anyone else. They are unfamiliar with youngchildren, though, so the program sends them into the schools totalk with students and teachers before they decide whether teachingis right for them.   A half-dozen have done their student teaching at Indian RiverJunior High School in Chesapeake, where Assistant Principal KathyDuLaney said, ``They're wonderful. They come in with a lot ofexperiences that we can use. They're used to dealing with thepublic. They've got lots of managerial skills.''   One Indian River mother wanted to know if her son could have aretired military officer for his teacher again this year becausethe one her son had last year was the only teacher who ever madehim work, Ms. DuLaney said.   The military retirees also provide good role models for teen-ageboys, she said. ``For so many of our kids the father figure isabsent.''   Similar programs are offered in Florida, California and NorthCarolina, which have large military populations, but Old Dominion'sis the largest, said MacDonald. Many of the retired officers areinterested in teaching math or science, both areas where teachershortages have developed.   Hutton went into his new job with realistic expectations, sohe's had few surprises. He has learned that teaching rambunctiouschildren takes a lot more patience than giving orders to sailors ona ship. ``It takes an awful lot of patience and you have to grabevery success that you have and remember it because the successesare few and long in coming.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Oct. 5</NOTE></DOC>
