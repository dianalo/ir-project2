Once the five-year leases for four bases and about 20 additionalcommunications facilities expire, the United States has 17 months toleave, one official said. The next round of talks on extending theagreement is scheduled for January, said the officials, all of whomrequested anonymity.   ``Important differences remain but the negotiations are not at animpasse,'' said one.   One major obstacle is a Greek demand that the United States closeits most visible base, the Hellenikon air force base in suburbanAthens. The base has been an irritant to nationalist and leftistgroups opposed to the U.S. presence in their country.   Talks between the sides broke off in September after Greeceannounced it would shut down Hellenikon once the lease expires.About 1,400 American servicemen, 200 civilian employees and 700Greeks work at the base, which was established in the 1940s.   Negotiations resumed Oct. 3 after Secretary of State GeorgeShultz met Foreign Minister Carolos Popoulias in Washington.   Since the 1950s, the United States has operated four bases inGreece. In addition to Hellenikon, there is a navy communicationsbase at Nea Makri near Athens, a Navy installation at Souda Bay onthe island of Crete and an Air Force communications base at Gournes,also on Crete.   The United States gives Greece more than $430 million a year inmilitary credits in exchange for the bases.   The government of Socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou has beenunder heavy pressure to remove the bases, and the pressure is likelyto increase during the campaign for June elections in Greece.</TEXT></DOC>
