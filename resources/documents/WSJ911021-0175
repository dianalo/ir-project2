The negotiations are focusing on how to rewrite the rulesgoverning competition among the banking, securities andinsurance industries. So far, the discussions that began latelast week involve the staffs of the two committees, but thetalks have been blessed by Banking Committee Chairman HenryGonzales (D., Texas) and Energy and Commerce CommitteeChairman John Dingell (D., Mich.).</LP><TEXT>   Aides say the chairmen have decided to make an effort toavoid a nasty jurisdictional fight when the banking billreaches the House floor, probably within the next two weeks.A turf battle between the two panels helped kill a bankingbill in 1988.   &quot;These are the first conversations between these twocommittees,&quot; one staff member said. &quot;If you remember, theonly communications before now have been poison pen letters.&quot;For months, Mr. Gonzales, whose committee has authority overbanks, and Mr. Dingell, whose panel oversees securities andinsurance legislation, have been squabbling over thejurisdiction of their panels. The current round of talksstarted last week, after Mr. Dingell assured Mr. Gonzalesthat, contrary to earlier suggestions, he would like to seeif they could reconcile conflicting versions of the twopanel's bills.   A fundamental difference is that the Banking Committeewould allow commercial companies, such as Sears, Roebuck andamp;Co., to own commercial banks; Mr. Dingell opposes commercialownership of banks. Although both bills would repealprovisions of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which keeps banksout of the securities business, they impose differentrestrictions, known as &quot;firewalls,&quot; on dealings between banksand their securities affiliates.   In addition, the Energy and Commerce Committee measurewould give the Securities and Exchange Commission newregulatory authority over banks that are affiliated withsecurities firms, a move that would expand that committee'sjurisdiction into banking. The bills differ slightly on thetreatment of insurance, although both panels have voted toroll back current powers banks have to sell insurance.   The goal of the negotiations is to see if the committeescan agree on one bill to send to the floor. As a startingpoint, the Banking Committee staff has proposed a plan tostrip from the bill the provision to allow commercialcompanies to own banks. This would be a setback to Sears,American Express Co., General Electric Co. and insurance andbrokerage firms that want to include banking in the range offinancial services they offer. Under the plan, the Housewould vote on an amendment to allow commercial companies toown banks. Nearly everybody agrees this would fail.   Then the House would vote on a proposal to allowcommercial companies to buy failing banks. This would alsoface stiff opposition, but might squeak by if the Bushadministration could convince Congress that new privateinvestment would prevent bank failures and slow the drain onthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.   The Banking Committee plan would also accept Mr. Dingell'sfirewalls governing the relationship between banks and theirsecurities affiliates. Although the SEC would regulate thesecurities affiliates, the compromise would make it clearthat the Banking Committee, not the Energy and CommerceCommittee, would retain jurisdiction over the bankingindustry. This turf division is likely to be the mostdifficult to resolve.   The negotiations are in the early stages and could breakdown. Even if the two panels do agree, a compromise couldface opposition from the administration and the AmericanBankers Association, who worry that the committees haven'tgiven banks enough flexibility to sell insurance and enterthe securities business.</TEXT></DOC>
