The Chernobyl fallout created problems forthe mass media and the authorities. Both lacked individual preparedness.The knowledge necessary to face strong demands for information from thepublic was lacking. A sign of this lack of knowledge and experience wasshown when individual journalists - contrary to their usual behaviour- uncritically accepted the sometimes ambiguous information coming fromthe central authorities. For the authorities it was very much the same.The expert authority, the National Institute for Radiation Protection,had quite a lot of know-how, but no resources for such extensive informationas the situation required. Significant problems must be solved concerningthe cooperation between central and regional authorities. Direct contactsmust be established so that both types of authorities do not learn throughmass media what has been decided. The wordings of the messages conveyedin such critical situations must be a matter of more concern. Facts knownby the authorities must be presented in a way comprehensible to the public.Technical terms and units must be used with great care. Negative informationmust of course be presented but measures should be taken to countermandthe negative effect. A special responsibility should rest with the schoolsystem. The difficulties of informing the public after the Chernobyldisaster were still more emphasized by the study of how the brochureAfter Chernobyl was received.</TEXT></DOC>
