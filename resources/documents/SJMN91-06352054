So that's why Mayor Susan Hammer hitValley Fair mall just as it opened one recent morning, apparently hoping toget some Christmas shopping done when crowds were the smallest and her chanceof being noticed the least likely. She almost got away with it, too, until thesound of pursuing footsteps told her she'd been discovered -- by one of themall's Santas and his elves, chasing after her to wish her a Merry Christmas.Santa didn't say what Hammer asked for, but maybe you could guess (peace?quiet?).;   PRESENTS TENSE -- The Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Clara andSan Mateo Counties got what it wanted -- a $90,000 grant from the UPSFoundation that will buy a 22-foot refrigerated truck and pay for its staffingover the next three years. The UPS grant, the only one in Northern California,is part of $1.1 million in donations nationwide being delivered by thefoundation, but welcome as it is, that creates a worry. &quot;We hope people won'thear of the grant and think that the Food Bank has all the contributions itneeds,&quot; explains spokeswoman Colleen Lukoff. &quot;The demand for food is way up,too, and it would be nice if we had something to put in that truck.&quot; . . .Contributions to the Community Foundation of Santa Clara County are takingsome out-of-the-ordinary turns, reports exec director Peter Hero. &quot;In additionto the more usual gifts of cash from those in the valley who have been blessedwith success, mostly in electronics,&quot; Hero notes, &quot;the year end has alsobrought the foundation hundreds of shares of appreciated stock, an acre ofland in Los Altos, a house in Connecticut, a lot in Santa Cruz and amembership at Pasatiempo Country Club&quot; (but no partridge in a pear tree). Thefoundation sells the stuff, giving charitable groups the cash and the donors atax write-off. . . . It seems as if every other charity is seeking toys forneedy kids this year, and here's another: the Loaves andamp; Fishes family kitchen,which hopes to distribute the toys to parents today through Thursday. Ifyou're still playing Santa, the number is (408) 293-4505. . . . Who was thetalented ballerina who donated her time to perform for Valle Monte League'sannual children's party this year?
