Col. Oliver North is beginning hisretirement with more notoriety than most officers, but he is stillentitled to the same benefits as any of the other more than 1.5million men and women drawing military pensions.   North, the former national security aide who was indicted lastweek in the Iran-Contra affair, announced two days later he haddecided to retire on May 1 from the Marine Corps.   North said he was taking the step because he would probably haveto subpoena high-ranking government officials to mount his legaldefense and didn't want to do so as a military officer.   By specifying a May 1 retirement _ a request that has beenapproved _ North will have completed the minimum 20 years of activeduty required to retire with a pension.   Unless an officer has served 20 years, he is not eligible toreceive any type of pension. Starting at 20 years of service, thesize of the pension for officers of North's age is computed on arising scale _ going from 50 percent of basic pay up to 75 percentof basic pay after 30 years' service.   In North's case, the lieutenant colonel is drawing $3,693.60 inbasic pay a month, or $44,323.20 a year. With exactly 20 years ofservice, he will be entitled to 50 percent of that as a pensionpayment.   North's former boss, Rear Adm. John Poindexter, retired inDecember with more than 29 years of service and is drawing apension of more than $52,700 a year.   North will have to pay federal income tax on his pensionpayments. But unless he goes back to work for the federalgovernment, he's free to collect his military pension without limitfor the rest of his life.   Like his other former brothers in arms, North also will beeligible for a number of other benefits to help ease his entry intoprivate life.   For example, if he wants to continue shopping at a militarycommissary or exchange, he'll have that right. The former Marinewill also be able to relax at military officer clubs, use militaryrecreation facilities and read books at military libraries.   If he wants to shop for liquor at a military package store ortake in a movie at a theater on base, he can do that, too. And hecan also drop off his laundry at a base dry cleaning store or buynew clothing.   As a retired officer, North also is provided the right tomedical care at a military hospital, but only on a space-availablebasis. Active-duty servicemen are given first priority.   If he can't gain admission to a military hospital, North will becovered by the Defense Department's CHAMPUS health insurance plan.When he uses a private hospital and CHAMPUS, however, he'll have topay an annual deductible and 25 percent of his bill.   As a retired officer drawing a pension, North also will beeligible for burial in a national cemetery.</TEXT></DOC>
