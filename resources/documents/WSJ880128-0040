It declined to identify the institution.    The Cambridge, Mass.-based biotechnology firm said the investment will fund its expanding agricultural biotechnology research to develop and market genetically engineered alfalfa, corn, soybeans and wheat.    BioTechnica said it completed the first phase of the agreement, raising $10 million by selling 1,818,182 shares of common, or a 26% stake, at $5.50 a share and $15 million of convertible, subordinated notes due 1998. The notes pay 8.75% interest in cash or notes.    It also agreed to sell the institution $25 million of a new issue of nonvoting common stock at $8.10 a share over four years. Creation of that new class is subject to approval by shareholders at the annual meeting in May. The shares would be convertible to voting shares on a one-for-one basis as long as the conversion doesn't give the owner more than 30% of BioTechnica's stock.    Last September, BioTechnica announced a joint venture with RJR Nabisco Inc. to work on genetic engineering of food crops. </TEXT></DOC>
