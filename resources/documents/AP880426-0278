Set to open Tuesday (May 2), the Oekobank _ or Ecology Bank _will adhere to a new kind of political and environmental conscience.   The Oekobank will support projects such as alternative energydevelopment, pesticide-free agriculture, and women's self-helpcenters, but eschew investments linked with, for example, the armsindustry or South Africa.   Dubbed the ``bankers in tennis shoes'' by the national press,the informally dressed, leftist-oriented crew stresses it's stilladhering to traditional, profit-making goals.   ``The main difference between the Oekobank and regular banks isour stance on political and environmental issues. But our workingmethods are the same,'' Oekobank spokesman Torsten Martin, 34, said.   ``Good intentions are fine, but the numbers have to balance,''Martin added, speaking in German.   All nine staff members have years of bank or economics trainingand experience behind them. Director Hans-Peter Schreiner, 40, hasserved on the board of directors at two banks.   The Oekobank is drawing considerable media attention, includingrecent articles in leading newsmagazine Der Spiegel and theconservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.   ``The ecology bankers want a new type of money house that offerscustomers a chance they wouldn't get in the big institutions,'' DerSpiegel said in a March 21 article.   The Frankfurt banking establishment, including the mightyDeutsche Bank, has so far declined to comment publicly about theupstart institution.   ``The established banks certainly don't regard us ascompetition,'' Schreiner said.   The Oekobank, with about 7.7 million marks ($4.5 million) ofequity capital, will be a Lilliputian among financial institutions.The Deutsche Bank, for example, has about 9.7 billion marks ofcapital ($5.7 billion).   The Oekobank's only office is located in the homey neighborhoodof North End, blocks away from the glittering towers of theDeutsche Bank, Kommerzbank, and other giants in West Germany'shigh-powered financial center.   West Germany's overseeing body for banks, the FederalSupervisory Office for Credit Institutions, gave the Oekobank itsfinal approval on March 7, but imposed several restrictions.   The Oekobank, for example, will limit its credit volume to threetimes the amount of its equity capital, although the law allowsbanks to issue credit up to 18 times that amount, Martin said.   Restrictions were necessary partly because the Oekobank has notbeen accepted into a deposit protection fund, a fund among bankswhich acts as a sort of insurance for bank customers.   Several innovations will enable the Oekobank to put itspolitical and environmental ideals into practice, Martin said.   One will allow customers to invest in savings certificateslinked to specific environmental or social causes.   Another enables borrowers to form a guarantors' pool for loans.For example, 10 people wishing to start a business could take out aloan of 50,000 marks, each person guaranteeing 5,000.   ``Many banks wouldn't spend the additional time needed toadminister such an arrangement,'' Martin said.   The Oekobankers may prove there is a market gap in West Germanyfor a bank with a liberal conscience.   Enthusiasm for the environmentalist causes of the Greens Party,for example, is still running strong, and thousands of protestorsregularly show up for nuclear disarmament demonstrations.   But the ecology bankers say they are independent of politicalparties, despite having regional Greens groups among their backersand a ranking Social Democrat federal parliamentary deputy on theboard of directors.   ``We're not a Greens party bank, or a bank only for liberals orthe little man,'' Martin said. ``Environmental destruction, thearms build-up, and disasters like Chernobyl are affecting people ofall classes and political beliefs.''   Oekobankers are also tapping into the ever-growing area of``alternative'' businesses, a broad variety of companies oftenheaded by young entrepreneurs, and based on collective ownership.   ``We'll be there for unconventional entrepreneurs whose ideasare often rejected by established banks,'' Schreiner said.   But the Oekobank will also help customers with non-politicalcauses such as car payments and home repairs, he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions April 30-May 1</NOTE></DOC>
