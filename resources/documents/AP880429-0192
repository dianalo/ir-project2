Both the opposition Liberal Party and New Democratic Partyslammed the Conservative prime minister, who has emerged from fourannual summits with Reagan claiming progress on acid rain, only tobe disappointed by a lack of U.S. action.   In a heated exchange in the House of Commons, New DemocraticParty leader Ed Broadbent ridiculed Mulroney's latest claim anddescribed Reagan as ``the only head of government in the modernworld who believes that trees cause pollution.''   Reagan once said birds and trees contribute to air pollution andhas refused to order costly acid rain controls.   ``The prime minister, in four years of talks, four years ofbuttering up to Reagan telling him everything he wanted to hear,hasn't got one bit of progress on acid rain,'' Broadbent said.   But Mulroney and Foreign Minister Joe Clark noted that Reaganasked Secretary of State George Shultz to begin priority talks withClark on an eight-point proposal Mulroney delivered with respect toan acid rain treaty.   Clark termed the Washington talks ``a significant new chapteropened.''   He noted that during the summit, U.S. negotiators at UnitedNations-sponsored talks in Geneva dropped their demand for theright to emit 20 percent more nitrogen oxides.   At a news conference in Washington late Thursday, Mulroney saidhe would remain persistent on the issue, but not become belligerent.   ``What do you do? Do you declare war? Interrupt relationships?''he asked rhetorically.   Mulroney added that leading members of congress also reactedfavorably to his call for a 50 percent reduction in the U.S.smokestack emissions causing at least of Canada's acid rain.   ``A treaty is inevitable between the two countries,'' he said.   The major causes of acid rain are nitrogen oxides from motorvehicle exhausts and sulfur dioxides from power plants.</TEXT></DOC>
