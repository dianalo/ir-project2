ATandamp;T's announcement of its fourth massive charge since its1984 breakup came as the company reported a 26% jump insecond-quarter net income, a spike mostly attributable to thesale of most of its investment in Sun Microsystems. Theresults also contained healthy revenue growth, given thecurrent recession, across most of its major businesses --including long-distance service, public telecommunicationsequipment and financial services.</LP><TEXT>   Second-quarter net was $828 million, or 75 cents a share,compared with $657 million, or 60 cents a share, in theyear-ago quarter. Revenue climbed 5.3% to $9.53 billion from$9.04 billion.   Six-month net rose 16% to $1.54 billion, or $1.40 a share,against $1.33 billion, or $1.22 a share, a year earlier.Revenue grew 4.3% to $18.72 billion from $17.94 billion.   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,ATandamp;T was quoted at $39.625, up $1.625.   &quot;The ATandamp;T ship has finally turned around and is headed inthe right direction,&quot; said Jack B. Grubman, an analyst atPaineWebber Inc. &quot;Full speed ahead.&quot;   Included in ATandamp;T's results was a pretax gain of about $140million, or eight cents a share after taxes, from the Junesale of 16 million shares it held of Sun Microsystems.Excluding the Sun sale, ATandamp;T earned 67 cents, only twopennies better than the first quarter, but 12% more than ayear ago.   ATandamp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen called ATandamp;T's results&quot;especially gratifying in view of the recession. . .&quot;   However, ATandamp;T's expected charges -- the latest in a seriesof writedowns that could potentially total more than $24billion since Dec. 1983 -- will mostly cover businesses thatanalysts say have annual losses in excess of $300 million ayear and are showing modest revenue growth. Since 1984, ATandamp;Thas had losses totaling more than $2 billion in its computerbusiness.   &quot;We want to get these businesses to the point where theyare contributors to the ATandamp;T company (and) to position ATandamp;Tand NCR for greater growth,&quot; said Robert M. Kavner, ATandamp;T'sdata systems chief and architect of the company's hostile$7.4 billion takeover of NCR.   Explaining its expected charges, ATandamp;T said the NCRcombination could require up to $1.5 billion in charges tomerge product lines, consolidate facilities and trim staffs.&quot;We expect benefits from lower manufacturing costs, Randamp;Deconomies and reduced (staff),&quot; said Mr. Kavner, declining togive specific numbers.   In addition, ATandamp;T said it is studying &quot;all the processesand systems&quot; it uses to sell, order, deliver, warehouse andinstall its products, potentially causing another $1.5billion in charges this year. While no business unit willescape the overhaul, most of the focus will be on privatebranch exchanges, or PBXs, said Mr. Kavner.   Promising a &quot;massive reorganization&quot; of the PBX businessso that ATandamp;T can &quot;distribute much more efficiently andeffectively,&quot; Mr. Kavner added that &quot;(currently) the businessis too complicated.&quot; He said the revamp will aim to focusATandamp;T on a &quot;core set of products&quot; centering on its Definityline of PBXs, voice mail and software.   Another potential $1 billion in charges will come fromother cost cutting, said Roger Davis, ATandamp;T's vice presidentand controller. The company, which has cut more than 100,000jobs since its breakup to a current level of 272,700 workers,will put all of its leased and owned facilities under amicroscope. ATandamp;T currently owns or leases 7,500 sites aroundthe country. Recently the company announced the lease andeventual sale of its gold-plated and underutilized Manhattanheadquarters to Sony Corp., a deal that Mr. Davis said is an&quot;excellent example&quot; of things to come.   Also included in this potential $1 billion in charges isATandamp;T's recently announced tentative agreement to take overdirect long-distance service to Alaska from Alascom. ATandamp;Tsaid the cost of eliminating a service subsidy it iscurrently paying to Alascom would be about $300 million.   Broken down, ATandamp;T's long-distance revenue in the quarterwas $5.01 billion, a 3.9% rise over last year and 2.9% fromthe first quarter of 1991.   Revenue from network gear sold to phone companies advanced8.9%, to $1.94 billion. Sales of microelectronics productsrose 12.1%, to $315 million. Both sectors were helped byincreased sales to international customers, and in the caseof network equipment, domestic sales of cellular equipment toGTE Corp. Sales of office phone switches (PBXs) and computersrose 1.7% to $855 million.   Second-quarter revenue from financial services andleasing, including the ATandamp;T Universal Card and ATandamp;T CapitalCorp., jumped 94% from last year to $289 million. But thecard operation won't be profitable until 1992, ATandamp;T said.</TEXT></DOC>
