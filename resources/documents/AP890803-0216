It was an emotional issue for the delegates at the group's 49thbiennial convention. Although all outsiders were barred from StateFair Arena while resolutions were debated, it was possible forpeople outside to hear some of the arguments.   At one point, after the assault weapons resolution was declaredadopted, some of the delegates roared a demand for a count ofhands. After minutes of confusion and shouts from the floor, adecision was made to pass by the resolution so delegates couldstudy it further.   It was brought back up more than an hour later and passed onwhat sounded like a very close voice vote.   ``I think that once they realized that this would not preventtheir brother officers from purchasing such weapons, many of themchanged their minds,'' Stokes said.   ``They're coming across the border with military weapons,''argued Duane Wilson from Pima County, Ariz., who said he and hisfellow officers had to patrol thousands of miles infested by drugsmugglers.   Wilson said his county, which covers nearly 10,000 square miles,probably was the nation's No. 3 area for illegal drugs imports``and a number of our officers already have purchased assaultweapons. A lot more are going to have to.''   In addition to approving restrictions on the ownership, transferor sale of assault weapons, the delegates easly adopted resolutionscalling for a seven-day waiting period for the purchase of guns andopposing any weakening of current laws dealing with ownership ofmachine guns and silencers.   And they went on record for a boycott of any music group that intheir songs advocated assaults on police.   The resolution originally was targeted only toward a rap musicgroup known as NWA. The delegates were told that one of thatgroup's songs called on young people ``to go out and kill a cop....''   After one delegate heatedly called the original resolutionracist, it was amended to cover any group that advocated assaultson police. The amendment also called on police to refuse to providesecurity for such groups.</TEXT></DOC>
