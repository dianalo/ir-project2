The refugees from Communist-led East Germany seek freedom, travel and better living. The East Germans coming West via Hungary this summer remind us that the German question is not at all the longing for a reunited Germany or the resurrection of nationalist feelings, but simply a quest for freedom.    The same is true of West Germans, though Bonn hears questions from Washington, London and Paris. Are the West Germans drifting East? Are they going to betray the Alliance to establish a European hegemony together with the Soviet Union? Are they so keen to do business with the Warsaw pact that they would even sacrifice common security? Is reunification more important to them than friendship with the free West? Does the recent electoral success of the so called &quot;Republicans,&quot; a radical movement on the far right, reflect a revival of German nationalism? Can one still trust the Germans?    The Germans are well advised to take such fears seriously. Nevertheless the reality is more complex.    Granted: It is somewhat difficult to understand how, only four decades after Hitler, a far-right nationalist and populist movement could emerge again in Germany. Who does it surprise that the world is scared listening to the Republicans' leader, Franz Schoenhuber? But there is another perspective. Couldn't the appearance of a new right wing party be a sign that West Germany has achieved a state of democratic normalcy? Isn't it true that an extreme right exists in almost all Western democracies? Naturally, people are more critical of Herr Schoenhuber than of the leader of France's rightist National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen. But isn't the phenomenon similar? Messrs. Schoenhuber and Le Pen have already begun working together. Wouldn't there be a right-wing in the U.S. Congress, if America had a system of proportional representation?    West Germany's alleged &quot;super-stability,&quot; moreover, has often been criticized as a lack of pluralism and vitality. Herr Schoenhuber, without doubt, is anything but the incarnation of an open society. But Freedom is partly the right to voice reactionary thoughts. Before the 1980s, West Germany had only three big political parties: the Christian Democrats, Social Democrats and Free Democrats. Since then, we have witnessed the rise of two new parties, the Greens on the left and now the &quot;Reps&quot; on the far right. If the political spectrum has broadened and become more like that in other western countries, is that to Germany's disadvantage?    Granted: It is difficult to understand why Germans -- who lost the war -- today seem to be engaged in new discussions about national reunification, about the continuing legal existence of the borders of 1937, and about finding a way between East and West. But see the whole picture. For the vast majority of Germans, the recreation of the old big German &quot;Nationalstaat&quot; is not a realistic aim, perhaps not even the subject of wishes or dreams. There might be a few who still think along these lines, but not the mainstream and not the elected government. For Chancellor Kohl, it is not a matter of territory, but freedom. &quot;The core of the German question is freedom,&quot; he said in 1986. The government of Mr. Kohl and his Free Democratic foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, is strongly opposed to a German &quot;Sonderweg,&quot; or special way, between the Blocs. On the contrary, it believes that the German question can be solved only in accordance with the political will and the values of Europe, only together with, and not against, our Western friends. &quot;The unity of the nation should fulfill itself in the freedom of its citizens,&quot; Mr. Kohl said in 1987, calling freedom the &quot;precondition of unity, not its price.&quot;    The substance of the Kohl-Genscher policy is pragmatic cooperation with East Berlin -- with clear acknowledgement of postwar realities. What counts for the chancellor is solving the day-to-day problems between the two German states, not the revision of the borders. The visit of the East German leader, Erich Honecker, to Bonn in September, 1987, signaled to many non-Germans the beginning of an active reunification attempt on the part of both Germanies. In Germany, however, this is widely regarded as the end of German unity. Didn't the first official visit by the East German head of state finally acknowledge the existence of two German states? That meeting was dedicated to better political relations, to more cultural and youth exchanges, to trade and the protection of the common environment. It is not a national conspiracy against the rest of the world. The spirit of the visit was pragmatism, not revanchism.    Thanks to America, we know about the universal meaning of human rights. President Kennedy taught us &quot;to pay any price, carry any burden&quot; to foster freedom around the world. The U.S. fought two world wars against the spread of tyranny. So when Germans (West) look to Germans (East) and are concerned about their freedom -- is that being unfaithful to the West? Young Germans of today were brought up looking West, mainly toward America. Detroit is closer to them than Dresden. When they now begin to discover Eastern Europe, when they care about their countrymen in East Germany with whom they share many aspirations, then they are merely doing what &quot;Western education&quot; has taught them. Use your freedom responsibly. Do not sit back in your armchair enjoying your easy life, but speak out for the rights of those without rights. Germans who look toward the East are not disloyal to the Western alliance, but loyal to its very values.    What would happen were America divided by a wall? Wouldn't Americans in Iowa be interested in the fate of their countrymen in Illinois? If opportunities arose for closer contact, would they be unmoved? Wouldn't they try to organize youth exchanges, trade relations and partnerships between cities to overcome the frontiers of such a Divided States of America? Come to Berlin and see the Wall, and you will understand why Germans cannot stop looking East. Germany is the East of the West.    Americans might long even more strongly for such contact than do the Germans, who know that the division of their country is the sad result of a terrible war they themselves began.    Mainstream German thinking today is not interested in changing borders but in minimizing their divisive nature. If the nations of Europe come closer together and the reform movement in Eastern Europe continues, then the Germans will slowly overcome the division of their country -- but never against the will of their neighbors. Even after such a period of improving relations, there might remain two German states. But could anyone object if the Wall were torn down? The President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Richard von Weizsaecker, once stated: &quot;The German question is open as long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed.&quot;    ---   Mr. Pfluger is a visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution. He has served until recently as the press secretary of President Richard von Weizsacker. </TEXT></DOC>
