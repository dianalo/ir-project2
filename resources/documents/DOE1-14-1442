The possibility of resonancebehaviour of an echo signal is shown if frequencies of outside disturbancesare close to frequencies of plasma own oscillations. The accounting ofplasma dispersion properties brings about the appearance of two rwsonancemaxima on the curve of dependence of echo signal amplitude on phase velocityV/sub 0/. These maxima correspond to V/sub 0/ coincidence with phasevelocities Langmuir waves at the frequencies of outside disturbance pulses.The dependence of echo signal amplitude on V/sub 0/ permits to determinea derivative on the electron distribution fucntion as a velocity function.If outside disturbances are excited at frequencies of ion-acoustic oscillations,a resonance maximum occurs. One can determine the dispersion of Lamgmuiror ion-acoustic oscillations, i.e. the effective temperature of plasmaelectrons, according to the position of these maxima.</TEXT></DOC>
