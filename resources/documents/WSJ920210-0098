Indeed,American liberals using the 1972 U.S.-Soviet Anti-BallisticMissile (ABM) treaty as an excuse for not funding SDI werethrown off balance by the president's offer. But there is noreason to think he was insincere.   All postwar American Presidents have quickly perceived thedeadly seriousness of nuclear arms negotiations, so no offeris made lightly. More to the point, President Reagan greatlydistrusted the concept of mutually assured destruction, or&quot;MAD,&quot; which held that neither side would attack so long asan attack meant wiping both nations off the face of theearth. His proposal for cooperative self-defense was inkeeping with his efforts to move arms discussions with theSoviets in a more positive, and sane, direction.</LP><TEXT>   Nine years later, the Reagan proposal is bearing fruit. Inhis Jan. 31 speech at the United Nations, Russian PresidentBoris Yeltsin called on the U.S. to combine its Star Warsefforts with Russian technology to provide all nations with amissile defense. While the U.S. has not yet made a formalresponse to the proposal, U.S. Defense Secretary Richard B.Cheney called it a &quot;major breakthrough.&quot; This positive U.S.reaction was yet another sign that the early Reagan offer toshare defense technology was, and still is, a serious elementin U.S. national-security strategy.   As for Mr. Yeltsin, the U.N. proposal displayed hisperceptiveness, something the West often has underrated.Unlike America's Star Wars critics, he understands that aglobal defense against a limited missile attack is very closeto technological feasibility, primarily as a result of adecade of U.S. development. He understands as well that nocountry is more in need of such a defense than Russia itself.   As more and more nations acquire nuclear missiles, a MADdoctrine, if it ever made sense, no longer does. How does MADprotect against an actual madman? If an Iranian, for example,launched a single nuclear missile at, say, Volgograd -- whichhe could do with a rocket of only 700-mile range -- ittheoretically could kill 800,000 people, an incrediblecatastrophe. What solace would there be for Russia inretaliating against Tehran? It so happens that most of thenuclear proliferation in the world is occurring near Russia'sborders, in North Korea, China, India, Pakistan, Iran and,until recently, Iraq.   Mr. Yeltsin has another reason for being conscious of theimportance of SDI. It played an important role in bringingabout the collapse of the Soviet Union. The knowledge thatthe U.S.S.R. could not compete with the U.S. in a high-techarms race helped convince Mikhail Gorbachev that he must movefrom confrontation to conciliation. His recognition that hecould not achieve conciliation and at the same time usemilitary force to hold the Soviet empire together forced himto allow the empire to break up, producing the situation Mr.Yeltsin has inherited. SDI, in short, helped the West win theCold War. While Ronald Reagan may never have expected SDI to&quot;destabilize&quot; the U.S.-Soviet military relationship, it hadthat effect anyway, primarily because the Russians feared theadvance of U.S. technology. Mr. Yeltsin has decided that, &quot;ifyou can't lick 'em, join 'em.&quot;   But after a U.S.-Russian agreement in principle onmissile-defense cooperation, what about ways and means?Interestingly enough, given the progress already made in theU.S. on SDI development, that question is far less dauntingthan it might at first seem. There is already an acronym forit. It's called &quot;GPALS&quot; for Global Protection Against LimitedStrikes. On the basis of present knowledge, SDI experts havelittle doubt that they can create a global missile-defensesystem. It would depend partly on space-based sensors todetect missile launches, and on small space-basedinterceptors, &quot;Brilliant Pebbles,&quot; to intercept the missileand destroy it over the territory of the attacker.Ground-based defenses would back up the &quot;pebbles.&quot;   Some of this technology was used in the Gulf War, whichhas been described as the first &quot;space war.&quot; U.S. militaryreconnaissance satellites deployed over the Gulf were able tospot Scud rocket launchings, aiding efforts to interceptScuds with ground-based Patriot missiles and to destroylaunchers. A global system would be far more sophisticatedalthough advocates of GPALS claim it could be deployed at acost of $46 billion in 1991 dollars spread over 14 years,with the cost in no single year exceeding $7 billion. TheU.S. would supply and manage the space component, which couldbe effective against limited attack with little more than1,000 interceptor satellites. Cooperative use of the U.S.system would obviate other countries cluttering space withtheir own defensive satellite systems and possiblyinterfering with launches of satellites for peaceful,commercial purposes.   Some military experts believe coordinating space andground-based defenses would be a logical role for the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a 42-year-old defensivealliance in which 15 nations work closely together, all butFrance adhering to a single command structure. Thepost-Communist nations of central Europe already have askedNATO to put them under its security umbrella. NATO andRussian officers are engaged in wide-ranging good willdiscussions as well. What could better serve to finally closethe old Cold War gap than a cooperative effort to protectagainst a limited strike from some rogue nation or terroristgroup? Russian ABM researchers have focused heavily ontargeting objects in space with high-energy beams from earth.They might be able to bring significant technology to thejoint defense effort.   Of course, there still are a lot of loose ends from theold MAD days. The ABM treaty, although violated by theCommunists, still exists. Most of those loose ends consist ofnuclear warheads. George Bush and Mr. Yeltsin are talkingabout sharp reductions in warhead arsenals and in today'sclimate of greater trust, that seems feasible. The Russiansmight accept U.S. help in disarming warheads. Mr. Bush'starget of no more than 4,500 on either side seems areasonable short-range objective.   Even with 4,500 missiles each, the U.S and Russia wouldstill have incredible destructive power and would be capableof overwhelming a GPALS defense. So clearly, a key argumentfor a cooperative defense would be to foster the mutual trustthat will be essential if either country is to ever consideritself truly safe from nuclear attack. That too argues forbasing the effort in NATO, which for 42 years has preservedmutual trust among the military organizations of westernEurope.   Ronald Reagan started more than even he imagined in 1983.It is up to his successors to carry on and produce a saferworld.</TEXT></DOC>
