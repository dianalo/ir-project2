At the same time, shareholders approved the adoption of a rights plan and a super-majority voting approval requirement. They also approved the relocation of the company's registered office to Toronto from Vancouver and a name change to NHI Nelson Holdings International Ltd.    Following the consolidation, the entertainment company, which has film and television operations in Beverly Hills, Calif., will have about 4.1 million shares outstanding. The number of authorized common shares will remain at 100 million. Under the rights plan, holders will have one right for each common share held, with each right entitling the purchase of one common share for 100 Canadian dollars. The rights plan would be triggered if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the common shares outstanding without making an offer to all shareholders.    Under the super-majority amendment, certain mergers and other transactions would require approval of holders of 80% of the company's common shares outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
