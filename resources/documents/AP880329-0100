Here are some of the comments of newspapers in thosecountries:</TEXT><HEAD>SOUTH AFRICA</HEAD><TEXT>   _Business Day of Johannesburg (pro-business): ``It has ... beena widespread belief that the U.S. is `not ready' for a blackpresident. The support Michigan gave Jackson on Saturday raises theintriguing possibility that this may not be true.   ``It is more than 30 years since Brown vs. Board of Educationended segregation in American schools, and racial causes havesteadily declined in influence. Could it be that many youngAmericans, nurtured in an environment of equal rights, haveoutgrown racial prejudice?   `` ... Jackson probably won't become president this year, but hecould be the man who opens the way to the White House for a blackAmerican.''</TEXT><HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD><TEXT>   _The Daily Telegraph of London (conservative): ``Mr. Jacksonstill stands very little chance of securing the nomination: he iswidely perceived as unelectable in November not because he is black_ America may be ready for that _ but becauppeal even to white hardhatsin industrial Michigan is to strengthen his claim to the vicepresidential spot on the Dukakis ticket, or at the very least to asay in pulling Mr. Dukakis's platform to the left.''</TEXT><TEXT>   _The Times of London (conservative-independent): ``Mr. Jacksonis not unelectable because blacks vote for him. ... He isunelectable because of the kind of whites who vote for him. Theentrails from Michigan show him with disproportionate support fromthe sort of voters _ such as those in the state's numerousuniversity towns _ who were for Mr. McGovern in 1972. He wasunelectable, and white.   ``Sooner or later, a black presidential candidate will emerge inthe United States who will campaign, not as a black _ emphasizinglinks with races and idealogues abroad who have nothing in commonwith American blacks either in outlook or standard of living _ butas a traditional Democrat or Republican.''</TEXT></DOC>
