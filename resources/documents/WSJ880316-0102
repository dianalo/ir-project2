Torell III unexpectedly resigned as president of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., a move that some of the bank's senior executives speculated was prompted by company directors.    In a terse announcement late yesterday afternoon, the nation's sixth-largest banking concern said Mr. Torell, 48 years old, was leaving to &quot;explore other business opportunities,&quot; effective at the end of the month. No successor was named.    Mr. Torell, who has spent his entire working life at Manufacturers Hanover and has been president since 1982, had been viewed as the heir apparent to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John F. McGillicuddy, 57; his departure creates a vacuum in the bank's number two post.    &quot;I was not asked to resign, and there was no seed planted to start me thinking that way,&quot; Mr. Torell said in an interview last night. He said he &quot;wanted to do something different and try something on my own.&quot;    Inside Manufacturers Hanover, however, several executives said they viewed Mr. Torell's resignation as a sign of board determination to shake up management and improve the bank's poor performance. A combination of large, shaky loans to developing countries, troubled energy and real-estate loans and a costly 1984 acquisition that hasn't paid off have left Manufacturers in a weakened capital position and spurred investor speculation that it would have to eliminate its dividend.    Speculation that the board had encouraged Mr. Torell's resignation was fueled by the bank's skimpy explanation to its employees and the public. Following a meeting of the board, Mr. McGillicuddy met with the bank's senior officers and read them, without further elaboration, the brief news release announcing Mr. Torell's departure.    &quot;It was a terrible day for him, you could see it in his face,&quot; said one senior bank officer. &quot;He was clearly emotional about it.&quot; Mr. Torell wasn't present at either the board meeting or the session with senior management.    Another senior officer speculated Mr. Torell may have decided to resign because he realized he had little hope of succeeding Mr. McGillicuddy in the bank's top job.    Manufacturers Hanover, the parent of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., is a huge international bank, but is generally regarded as one of the weakest of the major U.S. banks. The holding company had $73 billion of assets and 29,000 employees at the end of 1987.    In 1984, it paid $1.5 billion for the C.I.T. Group, a huge commercial and consumer finance company, in an attempt to bolster domestic earnings. So far C.I.T. has been a disappointment.    To counter persistent rumors that Manufacturers Hanover planned to slash its dividend or merge with a foreign bank, Messrs. McGillicuddy and Torell last week took the highly unusual step of forecasting 1988 earnings of at least $807 million. Last year, the bank had a loss of $1.1 billion, largely because of a $1.7 billion addition to loan-loss reserves for Latin American loans.    One Manufacturers Hanover executive who asked to remain anonymous said he thought Mr. Torell's resignation &quot;sends a positive message to employees that it isn't business as usual around here anymore. We've needed a major change and shakeup in this culture. A change in leadership certainly sends a message that there are no sacred cows.&quot;    The announcement caught securities analysts and bank employees unaware. Lawrence Cohn, of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., said, &quot;This surprises me. I thought Torell was the heir apparent.&quot;    Mr. Torell, who is generally well liked within the bank, has always been regarded as protege of Mr. McGillicuddy. He joined the bank as a management trainee after graduating from Princeton University in 1961, and rose through management ranks as a commercial banker and corporate planner. Last year, he earned $675,000 in salary and bonuses.    Mr. Torell said, &quot;I've been talking to John (McGillicuddy) the last two weeks&quot; about leaving and reached a decision to resign while vacationing in Palm Beach, Fla., last week. He handed in his resignation Monday, he said.    &quot;There comes a time in everybody's life when you would like to do your own thing. What is it? I don't know. That's where the complexity comes in,&quot; Mr. Torell said.    In a statement, Mr. McGillicuddy said, &quot;The decision was taken at the initiative of Mr. Torell and was accepted by the board with the deepest regret. We wish him well in the future.&quot;    Mr. Torell said in the statement, &quot;I have spent 27 satisfying years at this institution. After 10 years as an officer/director, I feel it is time for a change.&quot;    A search committee of the board will look inside and outside the bank for a successor, Mr. McGillicuddy said. Some bank officers say they feel the company needs an outsider in the number two post to shake up the bank. </TEXT></DOC>
