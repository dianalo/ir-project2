The NPDWRs consist of maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) or treatmenttechniques for the SOCs and IOCs. The NPDWRs also include proposed monitoring,reporting, and public notification requirements for these compounds. Thisnotice proposes the best available technology (BAT) upon which the MCLsare based and the BAT for the purpose of issuing variances. In additionto the NPDWRs for the SOCs and IOCs, the Agency is also proposing secondaryMCLs (SMCLs) for nine contaminants. Monitoring requirements for approximately100 synthetic organic chemicals and inorganic chemicals which are not regulatedby NPDWRs are also proposed in this notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Written comments must be submitted by August 21, 1989.A public hearing will be held at EPA's Education Center auditorium, 401M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460, on July 12, 1989 and, if needed, onJuly 13, 1989, beginning at 9:00 a.m. If additional time is needed to accommodatestatements at the hearing, the hearing will be extended to July 13.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Send written comments on the proposed rule to SOCs/IOCsComment Clerk, Criteria and Standards Division, Office of Drinking Water(WH-550D), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington,DC 20460.

Statutory Authority </ITAG>Section 1412 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended in 1986 (``SDWA''or ``the Act''), requires EPA to publish Maximum Contaminant Level Goals(MCLGs) and promulgate National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWRs)for contaminants in drinking water which may cause any adverse effect onthe health of persons and which are known or anticipated to occur in publicwater systems. Under section 1401, the NPDWRs are to include Maximum ContaminantLevels (MCLs) and ``criteria and procedures to assure a supply of drinkingwater which dependably complies'' with such MCLs. Under section 1412(b)(7)(A),if it is not economically or technically feasible to ascertain the levelof a contaminant in drinking water, EPA may require the use of a treatmenttechnique instead of an MCL. Under section 1412(b), EPA is to establish MCLGs and promulgate nationalprimary drinking water regulations for 83 contaminants by June 19, 1989(see Appendix A for a list of the 83 contaminants). Regulations were tobe promulgated by June 19, 1987 for 9 contaminants, by June 19, 1988 for40 additional contaminants and by June 19, 1989 for the remaining 34 contaminants.An additional 25 contaminants are to be regulated every 3 years.A. MCLGs, MCLs and BAT EPA is to establish MCLGs at the level at which no known or anticipatedadverse effects on the health of persons occur and which allow an adequatemargin of safety. MCLGs are nonenforceable health goals. MCLs are enforceablestandards which the Act directs EPA to set as close to the MCLGs as feasible.``Feasible'' means feasible with the use of the best technology, treatmenttechniques, and other means which the Administrator finds available (takingcost into consideration) after examination for efficacy under field conditionsand not solely under laboratory conditions. Also, the SDWA requires theAgency to identify the best available technology (BAT) which is feasiblefor meeting the MCL for each contaminant. B. Variances and Exemptions Section 1415 authorizes the State (the term ``State'' is used in this preambleto mean the State agency with primary enforcement responsibility for thepublic water supply system program or EPA if the State does not have primacy)to issue variances from NPDWRs. The State may issue a variance if it determinesthat a system cannot comply with an MCL despite application of the bestavailable technology (BAT). Under section 1415, EPA must propose and promulgateits finding of the best available technology, treatment techniques, orother means available for each contaminant, for purposes of section 1415variances, at the same time that it proposes and promulgates a maximumcontaminant level for such contaminant. EPA's finding of BAT, treatmenttechniques, or other means for purposes of issuing variances may vary amongsystems, depending upon the number of persons served by the system or forother physical conditions related to engineering feasibility and costsof complying with MCLs, as considered appropriate by EPA. The State maynot issue a variance where an unreasonable risk to health exists. Whena State grants a variance, it must at the same time prescribe a schedulefor compliance with the NPDWR and implementation of any additional controlmeasures. Under section 1416(a), the State may exempt a public water system fromany MCL or treatment technique requirement if it finds that: (1) Due tocompelling factors (which may include economic factors), the system isunable to comply, (2) the system was in operation on the effective dateof the MCL or treatment technique, or, for a newer system, that no reasonablealternative source of drinking water is available to that system, and (3)the exemption will not result in an unreasonable risk to health. Undersection 1416(b), at the same time it grants an exemption the State is toprescribe a compliance schedule and a schedule for implementation of anyrequired interim control measures. For exemptions resulting from a NPDWRpromulgated after June 19, 1986, the system's final compliance date mustbe within 12 months of issuance of the exemption. However, the State mayextend the final compliance date for up to three years if the public watersystem shows that capital improvements to meet the MCL or treatment techniquerequirement cannot be completed within the exemption period and if thesystem needs financial assistance for the improvements, it has an agreementto obtain this assistance or the system has an enforceable agreement tobecome part of a regional public water system. For systems that have 500or fewer service connections that need financial assistance to comply withthe MCLs, the State may renew the exemption for additional two-year periodsif the system is taking all practicable steps to comply. C. Primacy As indicated above, States, territories, and Indian Tribes may assume primaryenforcement responsibility (primacy) for public water systems under Section1413 of the SDWA. To date, 54 States and territories have primacy. To assumeor retain primacy, States, territories, or Indian Tribes need not adoptthe MCLGs but must adopt, among other things, NPDWRs (i.e., MCLs, monitoring,analytical, and reporting requirements) that are no less stringent thanthose EPA promulgates. D. Monitoring, Quality Control, and RecordsUnder section 1401(1)(D) of the Act, NPDWRs are to contain ``criteria andprocedures to assure a supply of drinking water which dependably complieswith such maximum contaminant levels; including quality control and testingprocedures to insure compliance with such levels * * *.'' In addition,section 1445 states that, ``every person who is a supplier of water * ** shall establish and maintain such records, make such reports, conductsuch monitoring and provide such information as the Administrator may reasonablyrequire by regulation to assist him in establishing regulations, * * *in evaluating the health risks of unregulated contaminants or in advisingthe public of such risks.'' Section 1445 also requires EPA to promulgateregulations requiring every public water system to conduct a monitoringprogram for contaminants for which there is not an associated MCLG andMCL (i.e., unregulated contaminants). E. Public Water Systems Public water systems are defined in section 1401 of the Act as those systemswhich provide piped water for human consumption and have at least 15 connectionsor regularly serve at least 25 people. By regulation EPA has divided publicwater systems into community; non-transient, non-community; and non-communitywater systems. Community water systems serve at least 15 service connectionsused by year-round residents or regularly serve at least 25 year-roundresidents (40 CFR 141.2). Non-transient, non-community water systems regularlyserve at least 25 of the same people over six months of the year. Schoolsand factories which serve water to 25 or more of the same people for sixor more months of the year are non-transient, non-community water systems.Transient non-community systems, by definition, are all other water systems.Transient non-community systems may include, for example, restaurants,gas stations, campgrounds and churches, among others. F. Public Notification Section 1414(c) of the Act requires the owner or operator of a public watersystem which does not comply with an applicable maximum contaminant levelor treatment technique, testing procedure, or section 1445(a) (unregulatedcontaminant) monitoring requirements to give notice to the persons servedby the system. Notice must be given if a variance or exemption is in effector the system fails to comply with a compliance schedule resulting froma variance or exemption. Section 1445(a)(5) also requires public watersystems to notify consumers and the EPA of the availability of the analyticalresults of the monitoring for unregulated contaminants. EPA's public notificationregulations are codified at 40 CFR 141.32. Those regulations were amendedby EPA on October 28, 1987 (52 FR 41534). G. Secondary MCLs (SMCLs) Section 1412(c) of the SDWA also authorizes EPA to promulgate NationalSecondary Drinking Water Regulations (NSDWRs). A NSDWR is defined in section1401(2) as ``a regulation which applies to public water systems and whichspecifies the maximum contaminant levels which, in the judgment of theAdministrator, are requisite to protect the public welfare.'' The NSDWR``may apply to any contaminant in drinking water which may adversely affectthe odor or appearance of such water and consequently may cause a substantialnumber of persons served by the public water systems providing such waterto discontinue its use, or which may otherwise adversely affect the publicwelfare.'' NSDWRs are not federally enforceable but instead offer additionalguidance to water systems and States based upon odor, aesthetics, and appearance.Secondary Maximum Contaminant Levels (SMCLs) were established in 1979 for12 contaminants (44 FR 42196, July 19, 1979) and in 1986 for fluoride (51FR 11396, April 2, 1986). <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Establishing MCLGs </ITAG>A. Background In the 1986 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act, Congress revisedthe Act to require that MCLGs and MCLs be proposed and promulgated simultaneously(SDWA Section 1412(a)(3)). This change streamlined development of drinkingwater standards by combining two steps in the regulation development process.Section 1412(a)(2) renamed Recommended Maximum Contaminant Levels (RMCLs)as Maximum Contaminant Level Goals (MCLGs).To ensure compliance with the provision that MCLGs and MCLs be proposedand promulgated simultaneously and to ensure that adequate opportunityexists for public comment on these proposed standards, EPA is reproposingas MCLGs most of the RMCLs proposed in the November 1985 <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice. In addition, MCLGs for several substancesnot listed in the November 1985 notice are also proposed. Most of the MCLGs are being reproposed at essentially the same level asproposed in November 1985. However, the MCLGs for four contaminants arelower and four are higher than previously proposed. Two MCLGs are proposedfor the first time. Where EPA is proposing MCLGs which differ from thepreviously proposed RMCLs, the changes result from public comments and/oradditional data developed since the November, 1985 proposal. In these cases,the technical basis for these changes are explained in the discussion ofthe relevant contaminants. Section 1412(b)(1) of the SDWA directs EPA to publish MCLGs and promulgateNPDWRs for nine contaminants by June 19, 1987 and 40 additional contaminantsby June 19, 1988. The Agency published MCLGs and promulgated NPDWRs foreight VOCs and fluoride by June 19, 1987 (see 52 FR 25690, 51 FR 11396and 50 FR 47142). This notice proposes MCLGs and NPDWRs for 38 additionalcompounds. Lead and copper MCLGs and NPDWRs, also proposed in November1985, were reproposed for public comment in August, 1988 (53 FR 31516,August 18, 1988). The Agency also proposed rules for Filtration and Disinfectionof Surface Water and Total Coliforms, on November 3, 1987 (53 FR 42178and 42224, respectively). B. Procedure for Setting MCLGs A detailed discussion of how EPA sets MCLGs is found in the November, 1985proposal (50 FR 46944-46949). In summary, EPA uses a three category approachto set MCLGs (see Table 1). For those chemicals in Category I (strong evidenceof carcinogenicity), EPA sets the MCLGs at zero. MCLGs for Category IIchemicals (equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity) are set based upon non-carcinogenicdata [the Drinking Water Equivalent Level (DWEL)] (see below). The DWELis divided by an additional uncertainty factor to account for the potentialcarcinogenic risk. Alternatively the MCLG for a contaminant in CategoryII may be based upon lifetime carcinogenic risk calculations if a DWELis not available. MCLGs for Category III chemicals (inadequate or no evidenceof carcinogenicity) are set based upon the DWEL.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L0,tp9,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s100 </C>Table 1._<T3>Three Category Approach to Set MCLGs</T3><H1/>  Category I:<ITAG tagnum="12"> Strong evidence of carcinogenicity </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">andbullet; EPA Group A or Group B </ITAG>Category II: <ITAG tagnum="12">Equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">andbullet; EPA Group C </ITAG>Category III: <ITAG tagnum="12">Inadequate or no evidence of carcinogenicity </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">andbullet; EPA Group D or Group E</ITAG></ITAG>  <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Setting MCLGs for Category I Contaminants </ITAG>Because there is no demonstrated threshold for carcinogenic health effects,EPA sets MCLGs for known (EPA group A) and probable (EPA group B) humancarcinogens at zero. EPA has received a request from Multinational BusinessServices, Inc. (``MBS'') to reconsider the Agency's policy of establishingMCLGs of zero for carcinogens and instead establish MCLGs for carcinogeniccontaminants at calculated negligible risk levels. EPA considered adoptingfinite, risk-based MCLGs when it promulgated MCLGs for five carcinogenicvolatile organic chemicals. EPA decided that, given the nonthreshold natureof carcinogenic effects, the zero MCLG option best fulfilled the mandateof the SDWA to establish MCLGs ``at the level at which no known or anticipatedadverse effects on the health of persons occur and which allows an adequatemargin of safety.'' (See 49 FR 24347-24348, June 12, 1984, and 50 FR 46895-46896,November 13, 1985.) The decision by the Agency was upheld in<T3> Natural Resources Defense Council</T3> v.<T3> Thomas</T3>, 824 F.2d 1211 (D.C. Cir., 1987). For the reasons describedpreviously, EPA believes at this time that it is appropriate to set MCLGsfor known or probable carcinogens at zero. However, the Agency has includedthe request submitted by MBS in the record for this rulemaking. The Agencyintends to fully address that submission and any related comments whenfinal regulations are promulgated.MBS also contended that the recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia Circuit in<T3> Natural Resources Defense Council</T3> v.<T3> EPA</T3>, 824 F.2d 1146 (1987) (``<T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3>''), which construed the Agency's duties under section112 of the Clean Air Act, also applies to the establishment of MCLGs underthe SDWA. The Agency does not believe that the court's analysis in<T3> Vinyl Chloride</T3> must be applied to the setting of MCLGs. Thatdecision construed the specific language of section 112 of the Clean AirAct and the legislative history of that provision. Section 1412 of theSDWA differs from section 112 of the Clean Air Act both in terms of itslanguage and legislative history. Furthermore, the role of the MCLG asa non-enforceable health goal, the first step in the process of determiningthe enforceable MCL, is unique to the SDWA. In light of the distinctionsbetween section 112 of the Clean Air Act and section 1412 of the SDWA,the Agency does not believe that following the<T3> Vinyl Chloride</T3> analysis in setting MCLGs is either necessaryor appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Setting MCLGs for Categories II and III Contaminants </ITAG>a.<T3> Calculation of Drinking Water Equivalent Level.</T3> For compoundswhich are not considered to have sufficient carcinogenic potential (i.e.,those contaminants in Categories II and III), EPA calculates ``no-effect''levels for chronic periods of exposure, including a margin of safety. Thislevel, measured in milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day),is termed the Reference Dose (RfD) [formerly termed the Acceptable DailyIntake (ADI)] and is derived from a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL)or lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) identified from a studyin humans or animals. The RfD is an estimate (with uncertainty spanningperhaps an order of magnitude) of the daily exposure to the human population(including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without appreciablerisk of deleterious effect during a lifetime. The RfD is calculated asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,i1,aw,6,21,28</C>  <H1>RfD=</H1><H1>(NOAEL or LOAEL)</H1><H2>(Uncertainty Factors)</H2><H1>=</H1><T2>XXX</T2>mg/kg body weight/day<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> Uncertainty factors are used in order to estimate the comparable ``no-effect''level for a large heterogenous human population. The use of uncertaintyfactors accounts for intra- and interspecies variability, the small numberof animals tested compared to the size of the exposed population, sensitivesubpopulations and the possibility of synergistic action between chemicals.Further discussion on the use of uncertainty factors may be found in theNovember, 1985 notice. From the RfD, a Drinking Water Equivalent Level (DWEL) can be calculated.The DWEL represents a media specific (i.e., drinking water) lifetime exposureat which noncarcinogenic health effects are not anticipated to occur. The DWEL assumes 100% exposure from drinking water and is derived as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,i1,aw,8,30,9</C>  <H1>DWEL=</H1><H1>(RfD)andmultiply;(Body Weight in kg)</H1><H2>(Drinking Water Volume in 1/day) </H2><H1>=</H1><T2>XXX</T2>mg/l<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="20">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Body Weight=usually assumed to be 70-kg adult. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Drinking Water Volume=assumed to be 2 liters(l)/day for an adult.</ITAG>b.<T3> Relative Source Contribution.</T3> To determine the MCLG for non-carcinogens,the contribution from other sources of exposure, including air and food,is taken into account. In the November 1985 proposal, EPA used the followingprocedure to evaluate the drinking water contribution relative to the totalexposure to determine the MCLG. If sufficient quantitative data were available on the relative contributionof total exposure from each source, the MCLG was calculated as follows(Note: this equation is conceptual in nature; i.e., the units do not balanceas written.):<ITAG tagnum="26">MCLG=DWEL^contribution from food^contribution from air</ITAG>The inorganics have been well studied in FDA market-basket studies andother surveys. Consequently, sufficient quantitative data are generallyavailable for inorganic chemicals.If sufficient quantitative data were not available on air and food exposurethe MCLG was calculated based on the drinking water contribution to theDWEL as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">MCLG=(DWEL)andmultiply;(% Drinking Water Contribution)</ITAG>For some contaminants, particularly the organic chemicals, data are generallynot available. When data did not exist, EPA then estimated drinking water'scontribution at 20 percent of total exposure. This value was consideredprotective and conservative and accounts for the range of actual (but unknown)exposures from different sources. When adequate data were available orwhen data indicated that the relative source contribution differed fromthe 20 percent value, the standard estimate was then modified as appropriate.To derive the MCLGs proposed in this notice, EPA utilized the general approachto assessing relative source contribution (RSC) as explained above andpresented in more detail in the November 1985 notice. However, EPA haschanged its policy regarding use of the RSC value as follows: Where dataindicate drinking water exposure is between 80 and 100 percent of totalexposure to a contaminant, EPA assigns a relative source contribution fordrinking water of 80 percent. If data indicate that drinking water is responsiblefor a large part of total exposure to a chemical (i.e., 80 to 100 percent),EPA believes that it is prudent to allow for the contingency that exposurevia air, food and other sources that may not be reflected in the availabledata is likely to occur. Utilizing the 80% ``ceiling'' for drinking waterexposures ensures that the MCLG will be low enough to provide adequateprotection for individuals whose total exposure to a contaminant is, dueto dietary or other exposure, higher than currently indicated by availabledata. This approach, in effect, introduces an additional uncertainty factorand results in a lower MCLG. It ensures that the MCLG will result in noadverse effect with an adequate margin of safety. EPA is considering utilizing a 20 percent floor in calculating future drinkingwater contributions. While EPA did not rely on the 20 percent floor inthis notice, EPA is considering assigning a 20 percent relative sourcecontribution value for drinking water where data indicates that drinkingwater contributes between zero and 20 percent of the total exposure. Inthese situations, drinking water contributes a relatively small portionof total exposure to a contaminant. The use of RSC values below 20 percentwill yield MCLG values which are lower than when a 20 percent value isused. However, because the majority of the total exposure is from othersources (i.e., the diet and air), EPA believes that the most appropriatecourse of action would be to try to reduce these other sources of exposurerather than to promulgate increasingly lower MCLGs to control the relativelysmall exposures contributed by drinking water. Use of a 20 percent RSC``floor'' may therefore be appropriate in these situations. EPA requestspublic comment on this approach. An additional issue regarding the RSC of drinking water contaminants isvolatilization. There is evidence that some drinking water contaminantsvolatilize into the air. Since a volatilized contaminant can be inhaled,the relative contribution from drinking water may be higher than a valuebased exclusively on ingestion exposure. However, little information isavailable to characterize exposure due to the volatilization of drinkingwater contaminants. EPA is presently developing a model which attemptsto characterize exposure due to the volatilization of individual contaminants(EPA. 1988. ``Volatilization of Drinking Water Contaminants (Draft)'').EPA intends to publish this model as soon as it is available. Currentlyinadequate data is available to estimate exposure to volatile contaminantsfrom other routes of exposure. EPA therefore estimates that drinking watercontributes 20 percent of the total exposure. EPA believes this estimateis conservative and is adequately protective considering the additionalexposure that may occur due to volatilization. When the volatilizationmodel mentioned above is complete, the Agency will decide whether it canuse it to derive MCLGs for VOCs. Table 2 summarizes the approach EPA uses to estimate the relative sourcecontribution for the purpose of calculating the MCLG. EPA requests publiccomment on this approach. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1,i1,s100,r100,r100,xs120</C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Relative Source Contribution_Percent of Total Exposure </T4><H1> </H1><H1>Drinking water exposure between 20 and 80 percent</H1><H1>Drinking water exposure between 80 and 100 percent</H1><H1>Drinking water exposure less than 20 percent</H1>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Adequate data are available<D>EPA uses actual data</D><D>EPA uses an 80 percent drinking water contribution</D><D>EPA would use a 20 percent drinking water contribution\1\</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Adequate data are not available</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="27">EPA uses a 20% drinking water contribution.</ITAG> <F>\1\ Not applicable to the MCLGs proposed in this notice.</F></ITAG> C. MCLG Value_Rounding Numbers  For each chemical in this notice, EPA determined the proposed MCLGs byrounding the final calculations to one significant figure. For example,if the calculations show a value of 0.44 mg/l, this is rounded to 0.4 mg/l.Conversely, a value of 0.45 mg/l is rounded to 0.5 mg/l. Values endingwith 5 or more are consistently rounded up. EPA believes that roundingis appropriate because using more than one significant figure would implya degree of precision that is not warranted given the large uncertaintyfactors (up to 1,000) which are generally used in deriving the MCLGs.D. Summary of Proposed MCLGs For most of the contaminants for which MCLGs are proposed in this notice,the Agency is proposing MCLGs which are essentially the same as those proposedin the November, 1985 proposal. For these contaminants, the details ofthe MCLG calculations, including the RfD, the uncertainty factor, the DWELand the RSC factor are discussed in the November, 1985 notice. Commentssubmitted on the RMCLs of the earlier proposal have been considered inpreparing the current MCLG proposal, and resubmission is not necessaryunless new information is available. The Agency's initial response to previouslysubmitted comments are summarized below. EPA will prepare a final Comment/Responsedocument when the rule is promulgated. EPA solicits comments on all contaminants particularly those MCLGs whichwere revised from the 1985 RMCLs. EPA also solicits comments on MCLGs proposedfor the first time in this notice. EPA is reproposing essentially the same MCLG values for the following contaminants(some levels are slightly different from those presented in the November1985 proposal because the values have been rounded to one significant figure):<ITAG tagnum="73">Inorganic Chemicals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Asbestos  </ITAG><P>Cadmium  </P><P>Chromium </P><P>Nitrate</P><P>Nitrite</P><P>Selenium</P><ITAG tagnum="73">Synthetic Organic Chemicals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Acrylamide  </ITAG><P>Alachlor  </P><P>Aldicarb  </P><P>Aldicarb sulfoxide  </P><P>Carbofuran  </P><P>Chlordane  </P><P>Dibromochloropropane  </P><P>o-Dichlorobenzene  </P><P>cis-1,2-Dichloroethylene  </P><P>2,4-D  </P><P>Epichlorohydrin </P><P>Ethylbenzene</P><P>Ethylene dibromide</P><P>Heptachlor</P><P>Heptachlor epoxide</P><P>Lindane</P><P>Methoxychlor</P><P>Pentachlorophenol</P><P>PCBs</P><P>Toluene</P><P>Toxaphene</P><P>2,4,5-TP</P>EPA is proposing new MCLG values for the following contaminants: <ITAG tagnum="73">Inorganic Chemicals </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Barium </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Mercury </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Total nitrate and nitrite </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Synthetic Organic Chemicals </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Aldicarb sulfone </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Atrazine </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">1,2-Dichloropropane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Monochlorobenzene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Styrene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Xylene</ITAG>Table 3 presents the proposed MCLGs for the inorganic chemicals and Table4 presents the proposed MCLGs for the synthetic organic chemicals.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,xs25 </C><T4>Table</T4> 3._<T4>Proposed MCLGs for the Inorganic Chemicals</T4> <H1>IOC </H1><H1>Proposed MCLG (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Asbestos million fibers/liter (longer than 10 um).<D>7  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium <D>5. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>0.005. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>0.1. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury <D>0.002. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrate \1\ <D>10 (as N). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrite \1\ <D>1 (as N). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium <D>0.05. </D><F>\1\ MCLG for total nitrate and nitrite=10 mg/l.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s20,xs48 </C><T4>Table</T4> 4._<T4>Proposed MCLGs for the Synthetic Organic Chemicals</T4> <H1>SOC </H1><H1>Proposed MCLG (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Acrylamide <D>Zero. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alachlor <D>Zero. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aldicarb <D>0.01. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aldicarb sulfoxide <D>0.01. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aldicarb sulfone <D>0.04. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Atrazine <D>0.003. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbofuran <D>0.04. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chlordane <D>Zero. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dibromochloropropane <D>Zero. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">o-Dichlorobenzene <D>0.6. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">cis-1,2-Dichloroethylene <D>0.07. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene <D>0.1. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichloropropane <D>Zero. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-D <D>0.07. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Epichlorohydrin <D>Zero. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethylbenzene <D>0.7. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethylene dibromide <D>Zero. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Heptachlor <D>Zero. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Heptachlor epoxide <D>Zero. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lindane <D>0.0002. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methoxychlor <D>0.4. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Monochlorobenzene <D>0.1. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">PCBs <D>Zero. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol <D>0.2. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Styrene <D>\1\ Zero/0.1. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachloroethylene <D>Zero. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene <D>2. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toxaphene <D>Zero. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4,5-TP <D>0.05. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylenes (total) <D>10.  </D><F>\1\ EPA proposes an MCLG of 0.1 mg/l based upon a Group C carcinogenclassification and an MCLG of zero based on a group B</F><T2>2</T2> classification.</ITAG></ITAG>E. Summary of Comments EPA received 117 comments on the proposed MCLGs in the November 1985 proposal.A brief summary of the comments dealing with general issues concerningthe MCLGs follows. Many of these comments dealt with issues concerningindividual chemicals and are summarized in the chemical-specific discussionsbelow. EPA will respond to all public comments related to this rulemakingand any additional comments on this notice when the Agency promulgatesa final rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Comments on MCLGs and MCLs </ITAG>Twelve individuals or organizations addressed the term ``RMCL.'' Most ofthese commenters suggested that the name be changed to more accuratelyreflect its true meaning as a non-enforceable health goal. Others suggestedthat there is no need to establish both RMCLs and MCLs, and that the processshould be integrated into a single, science-supported standard, the MCL.One commenter discussed the use of uncertainty factors in setting MCLGsand MCLs. This commenter argued that MCLGs and MCLs should be calculatedusing smaller uncertainty factors. <T3>EPA response:</T3> Under the SDWA Amendments of 1986, the term recommendedmaximum contaminant level (RMCL) has been changed to maximum contaminantlevel goal (MCLG). This change will help clarify the non-enforceable statusof MCLGs. The SDWA requires promulgation of two distinct standards, theMCLG and the MCL. The 1986 Amendments require that MCLGs and MCLs be proposedand promulgated simultaneously. EPA believes the uncertainty factors utilized in deriving the proposedMCLGs will ensure that the uncertainties noted below are adequately takeninto account when MCLGs are set. The use of uncertainty factors representsEPA's best toxicology judgments considering the quality of the availabledata. These judgments are based upon procedures generally accepted in thescientific community. The MCLGs are health goals set at levels to preventadverse health effects with an adequate margin of safety. This safety marginmust be sufficient to account for data uncertainties, extrapolation fromanimal to human data, and other factors. The Agency does not believe thatthe use of smaller uncertainty factors will ensure that the MCLGs adequatelyprotect against adverse health effects with an adequate margin of safety.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Comments on the Definition of Community Water Systems </ITAG>Nine individuals or organizations provided comments regarding EPA's concernsabout long-term exposure in non-community water systems that serve non-transientpopulations, such as schools and factories. Some commenters believed thatthe definitions of community and non-community public water systems shouldbe unchanged. Other commenters felt that non-transient, non-community watersystems should meet the MCLs applicable to community water systems.<T3>EPA response:</T3> EPA promulgated a definition of ``non-transient,non-community water system'' (52 FR 25690, July 8, 1987; 40 CFR 141.2).EPA addressed comments submitted on this issue in the July 8 notice. EPAagrees with the commenters that non-transient, non-community water systemsshould be required to meet the same MCLs as community water systems sincethe chronic health risks to consumers in non-transient, non-community systemsare similar to those in community water systems. Consequently, the MCLspromulgated in this rulemaking will apply to all community water systemsand non-transient, non-community water systems. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Comments on Selection of Contaminants for Regulation </ITAG>Twenty-five commenters addressed EPA's approach to selecting contaminantsfor regulation. Under this approach, EPA establishes MCLGs and MCLs forsubstances that may present a drinking water health concern. Most commenterssupported this approach. Several commenters disagreed with this approachand felt that EPA should only regulate when contaminants (1) pose significantadverse health effects, (2) are actually or likely to be present in drinkingwater, and (3) are detectable by available analytical techniques. <T3>EPA response:</T3> Since the ANPRM and proposal in November, 1985,the SDWA was amended in 1986, and EPA is now mandated to set MCLGs andMCLs or treatment techniques for all of the contaminants referenced inandSection; 1412(b)(1), except for seven chemicals which may be substitutedout of the list (see 52 FR 25720). <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Comments on Selection of Specific Contaminants for Regulation </ITAG>Fifteen individuals or organizations submitted comments concerning theselection of specific contaminants for regulation. Several commenters discussedthe lack of human health data for these contaminants in drinking water.One commenter stated that MCLGs and MCLs should not be set for syntheticorganic chemicals since insufficient health effects data exists to evaluatethese chemicals. <T3>EPA response:</T3> As noted above, although EPA asked for public commentson which contaminants to regulate, the SDWA now specifies 83 contaminantswhich must be regulated by June 19, 1989. Under the Act, EPA has the discretionto substitute for seven of these compounds. On January 22, 1987 (53 FR1892) EPA published its list of seven substitutes. EPA agrees that humanhealth data for contaminants of concern are often limited. However, EPAdoes not agree that there are insufficient health effects data to justifyregulating the organic chemicals. Available health effects data indicatethat these chemicals can cause adverse health effects under certain conditions.The MCLGs are proposed at levels to prevent these effects with an adequatemargin of safety. The SDWA requires EPA to regulate synthetic organic chemicalscovered in this notice.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Comments on Procedures for Calculating MCLGs </ITAG>Twenty-two commenters provided comments on the procedure for calculatingMCLGs. A few commenters stated that the term Acceptab1e Daily Intake (ADI)was confusing and suggested that EPA derive only a single number (the MCLG).<T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA has substituted the term Reference Dose (RfD)for ADI. EPA believes that the derivation of the RfD value is an importantstep in determining and explaining the level of a contaminant which meetsthe statutory standard for MCLGs. (See the July 8, 1987 <T4>Federal Register </T4> Notice for discussion of calculating the MCLG.)<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Comments on Three-Category Approach for Setting MCLGs </ITAG>Twenty-seven individuals or organizations discussed the three-categoryapproach for setting MCLGs, as presented in Table 1 above. The majorityof commenters endorsed this approach. Several commenters criticized theAgency's policy of setting the M!CLG at zero for known or probable humancarcinogens. <T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA believes setting MCLGs for known or probablehuman carcinogens at zero is consistent with th: statutory directive toset MCLGs at the level at which no known or anticipated adverse effectson the health of persons occur and which provide for an adequate marginof safety. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has upheld thisapproach in <T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>Thomas</T3>, 824 F.2d 1211 (D.C. Cir. 1987). As discussed previously,the Agency continues to believe that MCLGs of zero are consistent withthe statutory directive. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Comments on Monitoring and Reporting Requirements </ITAG>Thirteen commenters discussed monitoring and reporting requirements forthe regulated contaminants. Several commenters felt that each State shouldestablish its own public notification and monitoring requirements and maintainall responsibility for issuing variances. One commenter noted that theStates strongly support maximum State discretion in establishing monitoringrequirements, particularly for synthetic organic chemicals. A number of commenters discussed the three-tiered monitoring scheme whichvaries monitoring requirements based upon the occurrence and health effectsof the specific contaminants. Most commenters expressed support for thismonitoring approach and the resulting flexibility. Two commenters wereconcerned that the guidelines for each tier will not have enough flexibilityresulting in small systems undertaking costly monitoring programs whichare not affordable. <T3>EPA response: </T3>The SDWA mandates that EPA establish MCLGs/MCLs,public notification, monitoring and variance requirements (among others)while States may implement and enforce these requirements. The monitoringrequirements for this regulation propose a phased-in sampling requirementbased on system size and reduced monitoring frequency for small systems.This approach would reduce the small system economic burden of monitoring.Furthermore, today's proposed rule allows the State flexibility in requiringinitial monitoring for pesticIdes and PCBs based upon a vulnerability assessment.The proposed repeat monitoring frequency for these contaminants is alsodependent upon the system's vulnerability and whether pesticides or PCBsare detected in initial sampling results. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Comments on Financial Considerations </ITAG>Six individuals or organizations discussed financial considerations indeveloping regulations. Several commenters stated that national drinkingwater standards (including the monitoring requirements) should be flexibleand cost-effective. <T3>EPA response: </T3>Under the SDWA, MCLs are applicable nationwide andapply to all systems, except where a public water supply obtains a varianceor exemption under the Act. EPA does take costs into consideration in developingNPDWRs and the Agency agrees that cost effectiveness considerations shouldbe taken into account. In terms of compliance monitoring, EPA agrees thatthe monitoring requirements should be tailored to local conditions andis proposing monitoring requirements which allow States to determine whichsystems must monitor based on a vulnerability assessment.F. Proposed MCLGs for Inorganic Chemicals 1. <T3>Asbestos. </T3>EPA proposed an MCLG of 7.1 million fibers/liter forasbestos fibers exceeding 10 um in length in November 1985. That proposalwas based upon evidence of occurrence of benign polyps in male rats followingoral administration of intermediate (andgreater;10 um range chrysotile asbestos.EPA also requested comment on the option of not proposing a primary regulationfor asbestos due to the inconclusive nature of the health data. EPA hasreexamined both options and has decided to repropose an MCLG of 7 millionlong fibers/liter (rounded off from 7.1 million) since sufficient healthand occurrence data exist to justify a national regulation and the 1986SDWA Amendments require the Agency to regulate this contaminant. EPA has classified asbestos as a Group A, known human carcinogen, basedupon human and animal evidence that inhaled asbestos is associated withlung tumors. However, EPA has not proposed an MCLG for asbestos based uponthis classification, since the evidence for the association between ingestedasbestos and cancer is limited (see discussion at 50 FR 46961). Instead,EPA has proposed an asbestos MCLG considering the chemical for drinkingwater purposes as if it were in Group C, based on the limited evidenceof carcinogenic effects via ingestion. EPA has considered whether inhalation exposure to indoor airborne asbestosfrom the water could present a health concern. EPA examined this issueand based upon available data has concluded that the risk of this routeof exposure is not significant. This is supported by a recent study fromthe New York State Department of Health (1986) (Investigation of IndoorAirborne Asbestos, Woodstock, New York, 1986). This is considered to bea worst case example since the drinking water was very corrosive resultingin severe degradation of the water system's asbestos-cement (A/C) pipe.Levels of asbestos were measured in excess of 300 million fibers per liter.Levels of asbestos in air were found not to be significantly differentthan background levels. Also, the levels in drinking water from corrosionof A/C pipe will be controlled in some systems by the corrosion controltreatment technique regulation for lead and copper currently being developedby EPA. On January 29, 1986, EPA proposed a rule under Section 6 of the Toxic SubstancesControl Act (TSCA) to ban the manufacture of certain asbestos products,including A/C pipe, and to phase out others. The TSCA proposal does notimpact the use of currently installed A/C pipe. EPA recommends that watersuppliers adopt corrosion control strategies to minimize corrosion of A/Cpiping material. <T3>Public comments: </T3>A total of 23 individuals or organizations commentedon the MCLG proposal for asbestos. A number of commenters stated that itwas not appropriate to set an MCLG for asbestos since there are inadequatedata to establish that ingestion of asbestos fibers presents a health risk.Three commenters felt that since epidemiological studies have not showna correlation between asbestos in drinking water and cancer and the onlyevidence of carcinogenicity of asbestos by ingestion is from the NationalToxicology Program (NTP) bioassay, an MCLG should not be established. Several commenters stated that it is not appropriate to set an MCLG forasbestos since there are inadequate occurrence data. They stated that theNTP bioassay indicated that only asbestos fibers longer than 10 um appearto be of health significance in drinking water and there are no data thatindicate that fibers longer than 10 um occur in drinking water. Additional commenters felt that an MCLG should not be established for asbestos,since analytical methods to measure low levels of asbestos are not available.One commenter agreed that it was appropriate to set an MCLG for asbestosbut expressed concern over the expense involved in monitoring for asbestos.Another commenter felt that imprecise analytical results can only justifyan MCLG of one significant figure. One commenter stated that the EPA didnot consider the interactive effects observed in the NTP bioassay.<T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA recognizes that the evidence of the health effectsof ingested asbestos is limited. There was an increased incidence of benignpolyps in male rats following ingestion of intermediate (andgreater;10 umin length) range chrysotile asbestos. However, EPA believes that thereis a sufficient basis to justify regulating asbestos for the reasons outlinedin the November 13, 1985, notice. Furthermore, the 1986 SDWA Amendmentsdirect EPA to regulate asbestos. EPA believes that sufficient occurrence data exist to warrant an MCLG forasbestos, since asbestos entering water supplies from asbestos/cement pipeis common where corrosive water is being used. While EPA agrees that thegreat majority of the asbestos fibers found in ground and surface watersare less than 10 um in length, available data indicate that a small percentageof fibers are greater than 10 um in length. Under the SDWA, the availability of analytical methods is not a prerequisiteto the establishment of an MCLG for a contaminant. Rather, that availabilityimpacts on whether EPA promulgates an MCL or treatment technique as theenforceable standard (see sections IV and VI for a discussion of analyticalmethods and monitoring requirements for asbestos proposed in this notice).EPA is proposing that only vulnerable systems monitor for asbestos, basedupon a vulnerability determination by the State. This should significantlyreduce the costs of monitoring. EPA agrees that this MCLG should only be one significant figure and isreproposing an MCLG of 7 million fibers/liter for asbestos fibers exceeding10 um in length. Regarding the comment on interactive effects, the NTP bioassay which studiedrats exposed to 1,2-dimethyl-hydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH) and DMH withintermediate range chrysotile asbestos did not appear to significantlyaffect the carcinogenic potential of DMH, neither increasing or decreasingbiologically important neoplasms. 2. <T3>Barium. </T3>EPA proposed an MCLG of 1.5 mg/l for barium in the November1985 proposal on the basis of a study showing that chronic exposure tobarium resulted in hypertension in rats (Perry, H.M., Kopp, S.J., Erlanger,M.W., Perry, E.F. 1983. ``Cardiovascular Effects of Chronic Barium Ingestion.''In: Hemphill, D.D., ed., <T3>Trace Substances in Environmental Health_XVII. </T3>Proceedings ofUniversity of Missouri's 17th Annual Conference on Trace Substances inEnvironmental Health. Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press). The1985 notice also described the results of an epidemiology study which foundthat male and female adults consuming drinking water containing high levelsof barium (7.3 mg/l) for more than ten years did not manifest significantdifferences in mean systolic/diastolic blood pressures (Brenniman, G.R.,Kojola, W.H., Levy, P.S., Carnow, B.W., Namekata, T. 1981. ``High BariumLevels in Public Drinking Water and Its Association with Elevated BloodPressure.'' <T3>Arch. Environ. Health. </T3>36(1):28-32; and see also Brenniman, G.R.,Levy, P.S. 1984. ``Epidemiological Study of Barium in Illinois DrinkingWater Supplies.'') While the Agency proposed an MCLG of 1.5 mg/l, EPA alsosolicited comment on whether the MCLG for barium should be based upon achronic suggested no-adverse-response level (SNARL) of 4.7 mg/l derivedby the National Academy of Science (NAS) (Drinking Water and Health, 1982.Vol. IV). EPA noted some concerns about the Perry and Brenniman studiesas well as the SNARL derived by the NAS. Because of these questions, EPAbelieved that further study was appropriate and the Agency instituted ahuman study subsequent to the 1985 notice that examined the effect of bariumin drinking water on blood pressure (Wones <T3>et al., </T3>1987, ``Lack of Effect of Drinking Water Barium on CardiovascularRisk Factors,'' University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati,OH, manuscript in preparation). After reevaluating the available data inlight of the human study, EPA is reproposing an MCLG of 5 mg/l for barium.In the Wones study, eleven healthy men were enrolled in a 10-week dose-responseprotocol in which diet was controlled, other aspects of lifestyle knownto affect cardiac risk factors were controlled, and the barium contentof the drinking water (1.5 l/day) was varied from 0 (first 2 weeks) to5 mg/l (next 4 weeks) to 10 mg/l (last 4 weeks). Multiple blood and urinesamples, morning and evening blood pressures, and 48-hour electrocardiographicmonitoring were performed at each dose of barium. There were no changesin morning or evening systolic or diastolic blood pressures, plasma cholesterolor lipoprotein or apolipoprotein levels, serum potassium or total calciumor glucose levels, or urine metanephrine levels. There were no arrythmiasrelated to barium exposure detected on electrocardiographic monitoring.In summary, drinking water barium at levels of 5 and 10 mg/l did not appearto affect any of the cardiovascular risk factors studied in this project.In light of the Wones <T3>et al. </T3>study, EPA believes that it is not appropriate to relyon the Perry <T3>et al.</T3> study in deriving the MCLG for barium. As the Agency notedin the preamble to the 1985 proposal, the rats in the study were exposedto minimal levels of trace metals, including calcium, and the lack of calciummay have contributed to the hypertensinogenic effects observed. Becausethe weight of the available human data (Wones <T3>et al., </T3>1987; Brenniman et al., 1981; Brenniman and Levy, 1984)appear to contradict the results found in the Perry <T3>et al. </T3>rat study and thereby substantiate the Agency's concernsabout that study, EPA is not relying on Perry <T3>et al. </T3>to derive the reproposed MCLG.The Wones <T3>et al.</T3> study failed to detect adverse effects at 10 mg/l. EPAhas applied an uncertainty factor of 2 to derive an MCLG of 5 mg/l. EPAapplied an uncertainty factor of 2 rather than a factor of 10 which wouldnormally be applied with a human study with a NOAEL due to the fact thatthe study is corroborated by the results of other studies (i.e., the Brenniman<T3>et al.,</T3> 1981 study). EPA has not factored RSC into this numbersince the basis is a human study in which contribution from food and airis already taken into account. The reproposed MCLG is supported by theresults of Brenniman <T3>et al.,</T3> which failed to find adverse effects at slightly higherlevels of 7.3 mg/l. Furthermore, the reproposed MCLG is also consistentwith the 4.7 mg/l value recommended by the NAS. EPA stated in the preambleto the 1985 proposal that 4.7 mg/l did not appear to be adequately protectiveof children. EPA now believes this is not the case since hypertension isan effect which is seen after many years of exposure and thus adults wouldbe the population at risk for this effect. EPA requests public comment on the approach used to set the MCLG for barium.<T3>Public Comments:</T3> A total of 14 individuals or organizations submittedcomments in response to the barium proposal. One commenter raised two points regarding the health effects of barium:(1) barium may have beneficial effects on teeth and bone, and (2) EPA hasincorrectly assumed that barium acts with no toxic threshold. One commenterargued that barium should not be classified as a heavy metal since thesolubility of barium is adequate to allow excretion from the body and preventcumulative toxicity. One commenter stated that EPA should distinguish between salts of bariumthat are water soluble (chloride, nitrate, bicarbonate) and those thatare water insoluble (sulfate, phosphate, carbonate). Two commenters expressedsupport for the proposed MCLG of 1.5 mg/l for barium, but most commentersdisagreed with the proposed MCLG, arguing that it is unduly restrictiveand should be higher. Reasons cited in support of this argument includedthe following: no information is presented to indicate barium occurs inpublic water systems at concentrations of 4.7 to 7.0 mg/l, so barium shouldnot be regulated; there is no evidence that barium bioaccumulates, so thereis no reason to expect cumulative damage; available epidemiological studiesindicate that barium-containing water does not cause hypertension or cardiovascularproblems; and establishment of a stringent MCLG will impose considerablecost of compliance without significant health benefits. One commenter stated that the MCL should be retained at the present levelof 1.0 mg/l until it can be proven conclusively that the proposed new level(1.5 mg/l) will not have hypertensinogenic or cardiotoxic effects. A numberof commenters argued that it is not appropriate to base the MCLG for bariumon the cardiovascular effects in rats reported by Perry et al. (1983).The reasons cited for this included the following: the results are basedon intravenous administration, which is not an appropriate model for oralexposure; the effects have been demonstrated in only one study; and availablehuman data are more relevant than animal data. A number of commenters argued that the study by Brenniman <T3>et al.</T3> (1981) is adequate to establish that ingestion of watercontaining 7.3 mg/l of barium does not result in hypertension in humans,and that this should serve as the MCLG. A number of commenters argued that the proposed MCLG for barium is undulyrestrictive and that the chronic SNARL of 4.7 mg/l calculated by NAS isa more appropriate value. These commenters stated that the study by Brenniman<T3>et al.</T3> (1981) confirms that a concentration of 4.7 mg/l is notassociated with adverse effects in humans, supporting the SNARL proposedby NAS. <T3>EPA Response:</T3> EPA is aware of only one report [Sanders, H.J. 1971.<T3>Chemical and Engineering News,</T3> Feb. 25, 1980, page 38] showingbeneficial effects of barium in animals, and EPA does not believe thereis adequate evidence to conclude that barium is beneficial to humans. EPAbelieves there is a threshold for health effects due to barium, and hasset an MCLG based on the threshold value determined from several exposurestudies. Whether barium should be classified as a heavy metal is irrelevant to theestablishment of an MCLG for this contaminant. The data clearly indicatethat there are adverse health effects from exposure to barium and the MCLGis proposed at the level which will prevent those effects with an adequatemargin of safety (see the Criteria Document on Barium). While barium sulfate is poorly soluble, it is not insoluble, and EPA isaware of no data indicating that dissolved barium sulfate is not absorbedfrom the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, insoluble barium salts may bepartially solubilized in the acid environment of the stomach. The commenter is incorrect in stating that barium does not occur in drinkingwater at concentrations of 4.7 to 7.0  mg/l. Barium is widely distributedin drinking water, and high levels do occur (Brenniman et al., 1981; Brennimanand Levy, 1984) . All the available evidence indicates that barium is toxic to humans andtherefore the issue of bioaccumulation in the body is irrelevant to theissue of what level will prevent those effects with an adequate marginof safety.Although the commenter is correct in stating that the available epidemiologicalstudies have not shown cardiovascular effects in humans, the availableanimal studies have demonstrated that hypertension is associated with exposureto barium. Furthermore, EPA has chosen the highest NOAEL from the availablehuman studies in order to be protective against the occurrence of cardiovasculareffects in the human population. Derivation of an MCLG (a nonenforceable health goal) is based on considerationof health effects only, and does not consider the cost of compliance. Thecosts of compliance are considered in the derivation of the MCL (see SectionIV). Regarding retaining the MCL at 1.0 mg/l, EPA has determined that the reproposedMCLG of 5 mg/l will prevent adverse health effects (hypertension or cardiotoxiceffects) with an adequate margin of safety. Thus, EPA does not agree withthe commenter that the MCL should not be revised. EPA is no longer relying solely on the Perry <T3>et al.</T3> study in determining the MCLG for barium, for the reasonsexplained above. However, EPA does not agree with the commenters that intravenousadministration should not be considered an appropriate model for oral administration.Intravenous administration is accepted by toxicologists as a valid testingmethod and may be used to approximate oral exposure. EPA agrees with thecommenters that more than one study should be considered, if available,and that, in this case, the available human data are more relevant in determiningthe human health effects of barium exposure than the available animal data.Therefore, EPA is basing the reproposed MCLG on the weight of all the availableevidence. EPA has considered the Brenniman et al. study in determining that the reproposedMCLG adequately protects against adverse effects with an adequate marginof safety. The Agency has derived the MCLG based on a NOAEL of 10 mg/lderived from the Wones study. EPA does not believe that setting the MCLGat the NOAEL from the Brenniman study is appropriate, since that leveldoes not include an uncertainty factor. The reproposed MCLG at 5 mg/l ofvery close to the NAS value of 4.7 mg/l, and EPA agrees with several commentersthat this level is appropriate. 3. <T3>Cadmium.</T3> EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.005 mg/l for cadmium in theNovember 1985 proposal. This was based upon a DWEL of 0.018 mg/l, usingrenal dysfunction as an endpoint. EPA has classified cadmium in Group B1,probable human carcinogen, based upon evidence of lung cancer in humansdue to inhalation exposure. However, EPA did not propose an MCLG for cadmiumbased upon this classification, since cadmium has not been shown to becarcinogenic through ingestion. Instead, EPA proposed an MCLG for cadmiumbased upon chronic toxicity data. Since there is inadequate dose-responsedata to characterize the presence or lack of a carcinogenic hazard, EPAis regulating cadmium for drinking water purposes as if it were in GroupD. No new relevant data which changes the conclusions presented in theNovember 1985 notice have become available since its publication. EPA istherefore reproposing an MCLG of 0.005 mg/l for cadmium. <T3>Public comments:</T3> Nine individuals or organizations commented onthe MCLG proposal for cadmium. Five commenters agreed with the proposedMCLG, stating that there are adequate health effects and occurrence dataand the value is in accord with the Suggested-No-Adverse-Response-Level(SNARL) proposed by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). One commenterstated that the present MCL of 0.01 mg/l was fully protective and shouldnot be lowered. Another commenter felt that the assumption of 25 percentdrinking water contribution in the MCLG calculation was too high. One commenterstated that EPA should regulate cadmium as a carcinogen. <T3>EPA response:</T3> Regarding the lowering of the present MCL, EPA believesthat this lower proposed MCLG is protective against adverse effects withan adequate margin of safety, for the reasons discussed in the November1985 notice. Regarding the 25 percent drinking water contribution for cadmium, EPA believesthat this value is appropriate, since evidence indicates that absorptionof cadmium is greater from water than from food. Thus, absorbed cadmiumfrom the drinking water would contribute more than the 20% which EPA believesis appropriate to allocate to drinking water when data indicating relativesource contribution are not available. Since actual data are not availablewith regard to cadmium, EPA believes that 25 percent is an appropriateestimate. The commenter provided no data to dispute this assumption. Furthermore,use of a 25% drinking water contribution yields a proposed MCLG which isconsistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation of 0.005mg/l for cadmium (Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality. Volume 1, WHO,Geneva, 1984). EPA has classified cadmium in Group B1, probable human carcinogen,based upon evidence of lung cancer from inhalation exposure. However, EPAis regulating cadmium for drinking water purposes as if it were in GroupD, since there is no evidence of cancer from ingestion exposure. 4. <T3>Chromium.</T3> EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.12 mg/l for total chromium(Cr III and Cr VI) in the November 1985 proposal. EPA has classified chromiumin Group A, known human carcinogen, based upon evidence that chromium VIcauses lung cancer in humans and animals through inhalation exposure. EPAdid not propose an MCOG for chromium based upon this classification, sincechromium has not been shown to be carcinogenic through ingestion. Instead,EPA has proposed an MCLG for chromium based upon chronic toxicity data,since there is inadequate dose-response data to characterize the presenceor lack of a carcinogenic hazard. EPA is regulating chromium for drinkingwater purposes as if it were in Group D. No new data which would changethe conclusions presented in the November 1985 notice have become availablesince its publication. EPA is therefore reproposing an MCLG of 0.1 mg/lfor total chromium, rounded from the proposed value of 0.12 mg/l. <T3>Public comments:</T3> Fourteen individuals or organizations commentedon the MCLG proposal for chromium. One commenter stated that an MCLG shouldnot be established for chromium since the data are inadequate to show thatingestion of chromium is associated with carcinogenicity. Another commenterfelt that there should be no change in the existing chromium regulation.Several commenters stated that the MCLG for chromium should be based onCr VI instead of total chromium since (1) analytical methods exist formeasuring Cr VI, (2) problems exist in applying an MCLG based on Cr VIto other valence states and (3) there is no evidence that Cr III is oxidizedto Cr VI during drinking water disinfection. Several commenters supported the proposed MCLG for chromium based on totalchromium, while a number of commenters argued that separate MCLGs shouldbe established for the two valence states of chromium, with main attentionon Cr VI due to the greater toxicity of this valence state. Several commentersstated that the MCLG for Cr III can be much higher or even eliminated.One commenter stated that EPA should regulate chromium as a carcinogen.Another commenter felt EPA should have assumed a drinking water contributionof 20 percent, not 70 percent, since the contribution from food rangesfrom 50 percent to 99 percent. <T3>EPA response:</T3> The MCLG for chromium is not based on carcinogenicity.While there is convincing evidence that occupational exposure (i.e., inhalation)to Cr VI may lead to cancer of the respiratory tract (NAS. 1977. <T3>Drinking Water and Health.</T3> Washington, DC: National Academy Press,pp. 241-246. August 1984.), EPA believes that the nature of the carcinogenichazard via ingestion cannot at present be defined. In this regard, EPA'sCancer Risk Assessment Verification Endeavor (CRAVE), an intra-Agency groupwhich examines the carcinogenic classification of chemicals, has concludedthat there is adequate evidence to conclude that Cr VI is oncogenic viainhalation in humans (EPA Category A). However, CRAVE concluded that therewas inadequate data to demonstrate that Cr VI has an oncogenic potentialvia ingestion. As there is inadequate evidence to suggest that chromiumpresents a carcinogenic risk via ingestion, EPA has based the proposedMCLG on a study which examined the non-carcinogenic effects following oraladministration of Cr VI.EPA believes that the health data are adequate to justify setting an MCLGfor chromium (see the November 1985 notice) and these data support theproposed MCLG, which is different than the interim chromium MCL. Furthermore,the SDWA Amendments mandate that EPA promulgate an MCL for this contaminant.EPA agrees that analytical methods exist for measuring Cr VI. EPA believesit is proper to set an MCLG for total chromium based on the toxicologyof Cr VI, since the two valence states are in dynamic equilibrium withthe degree of oxidation depending on factors such as pH, dissolved oxygen,or presence of reducing agents. Information on the oxidation of Cr IIIto Cr VI developed by EPA's Office of Research and Development has shownCr III to oxidize to Cr VI in the presence of chlorine at concentrationssimilar to those used to disinfect drinking water. Because of the potentialfor Cr III to be oxidized to Cr VI in drinking water, EPA believes it isappropriate to set an MCLG for total chromium. EPA agrees that Cr III is of low toxicological concern and thus has basedthe MCLG on the toxicity of Cr VI. However, EPA does not agree that separateMCLGs should be set for the two valence states of chromium since thereis the potential for Cr III to be converted to Cr VI in drinking watersystems (as discussed above) and separate MCLGs would not consider thisconversion potential. EPA agrees that food normally contributes over 50 percent of the totaldietary intake of chromium. However, in cases where chromium drinking waterconcentrations are at the MCLG of .1 mg/l, available data indicate thatdrinking water provides about 70 percent of the total daily chromium intake.5. <T3>Mercury. </T3>EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.003 mg/l for mercury in theNovember 1985 proposal. Discussions of the human exposure data and thehealth effects of mercury are presented in the November 1985 proposal.This notice will discuss only new data and conclusions since publicationof that notice, resulting in a reproposed MCLG of 0.002 mg/l. In the November 1985 proposal, EPA calculated a DWEL of 0.005 mg/l formercury based upon a study in which rats were exposed to inorganic mercurysalts for 8 to 12 weeks through subcutaneous injection [Druet et al. 1978.``Immune Type Glomerulonephritis Induced by Mercuric Chloride in the BrownNorway Rat.'' <T3>Ann. Immunol. </T3>129:777-792]. EPA used a NOAEL of 50 ug/kg/day (adjustedby 36 doses, 84 days), a factor of 0.739 to adjust for the percentage byweight of mercury in mercuric chloride, an uncertainty factor of 1,000and an absorption factor of 10% to compensate for the difference in absorptionbetween subcutaneous and oral exposure in the calculations. EPA based theDWEL and the MCLG on inorganic mercury since almost all mercury detectedto date in drinking water is in this form.The reproposed MCLG is based upon several short-term studies, includingthe Druet et al. study. EPA recently held a workshop on issues regardingthe DWEL for mercury (EPA, Peer Review Workshop on Mercury Issues, SummaryReport, October 26-27, 1987), and the conclusion was that since there areseveral short-term studies which used the same techniques and examinedthe same endpoints for mercury toxicity, each of these studies should beused as the basis for the DWEL. EPA calculated DWELs based upon the Druetet al. study in which exposure was via subcutaneous injection and two oralstudies (Bernaudin et al. 1981. ``Inhalation or Ingestion of Organic orInorganic Mercurials Produces Auto-Immune Disease in Rats.'' <T3>Clin. Immunol. Immunopath. </T3>20:129-135; and Andres, P. 1984. ``BriefCommunications: IgA-IgG Binding in the Intestine of Brown-Norway Rats IngestingMercuric Chloride.'' <T3>Clin. Immunol. Immunopath. </T3>30:488-494). The DWEL based upon theDruet et al. study has been recalculated using the same calculations asin the November 1985 proposal except for the absorption factor. An absorptionfactor of 7 percent has been applied (versus the 10 percent which was usedin the November 1985 proposal), since EPA believes that the current dataindicates that 7 percent absorption more accurately represents the actualabsorption of mercury. This absorption factor has been applied to accountfor the fact that the study was via subcutaneous injection instead of oralexposure. A DWEL of 0.011 mg/l was calculated based upon the Bernaudinet al. (1981) study; a DWEL of 0.022 mg/l was calculated based upon theAndres (1984) study and a DWEL of 0.008 mg/l was calculated based uponthe Druet et al. study. The workshop on mercury concluded that 0.01 mg/lis an appropriate level for the DWEL based upon a review of all the data.In addition, this level is consistent with the DWEL calculated from theBernaudin et al. (1981) study (this was rounded from 0.011 mg/l), whichwas the lowest exposure dose from a study using oral exposure. EPA believesthat studies using oral exposure are the most appropriate for drinkingwater purposes. In November 1985, EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.003 mg/l, based upon a DWELof 0.005 mg/l with data on human exposure factored in (0.0043 mg/day viathe diet and 0.001 mg/day via air). The dietary data consisted primarilyof organic mercury, i.e., the available information indicates that approximately10 percent of the dietary intake is inorganic mercury, with the remaining90 percent being organic mercury. Since the proposed MCLG was for inorganicmercury, EPA believes that it was incorrect to use the dietary data basedon organic mercury in the calculation. Instead, EPA proposes to apply a20 percent contribution factor from water. This is because the availabledata indicate that the drinking water contribution for inorganic mercuryappears to be small, with dental amalgams probably being the major contributingfactor to overall inorganic mercury exposure. However, the data are insufficientto evaluate the drinking water contribution in relation to other sourcesof exposure and thus EPA is applying a 20 percent drinking water contributionfactor. Applying this factor results in an MCLG of 0.002 mg/l. The WHOguideline for total mercury is 0.001 mg/l for total mercury, which is inthe same range as the proposed MCLG. EPA requests public comment on theapproach used to set the MCLG for mercury. <T3>Public comments: </T3>Eight individuals or organizations commentedon the MCLG proposal for mercury. Two commenters supported the proposedMCLG for mercury. Three commenters argued that the proposed MCLG was inappropriatefor the following reasons: (1) the uncertainty factor of 1,000 is too high,(2) the MCLG appears to have been based on the health effects of methylmercury even though mercury in drinking water is usually in the inorganicform, (3) increasing the MCLG from the current MCL of 0.002 mg/l representsa very small change in the actual number and thus is not worth changing,and (4) there is no evidence that exposure occurs at a level of healthconcern. Three commenters stated that EPA should not propose a separate MCLG fororganic mercury compounds. <T3>EPA response: </T3>An uncertainty factor of 1,000 is consistent withthe NAS/ODW guidelines for use with a NOAEL from an animal study of less-than-lifetimeduration. The MCLG was calculated based on health effects data on inorganicmercury, although discussions of the toxicity of methyl mercury are includedin the health criteria document. The reproposed MCLG is at the same level (0.002 mg/l) as the current MCL,thus the comment concerning the change in the number is no longer relevant.EPA agrees that exposure to mercury through drinking water is generallyvery low and is generally below the levels of health concern, however,the potential for contamination exists. In addition, the 1986 Amendmentsto the SDWA require that an MCLG be set for mercury. EPA agrees that a separate MCLG for organic mercury compounds should notbe proposed because almost all mercury detected in drinking water is inthe inorganic form. 6. andamp; 7. <T3>Nitrate and Nitrite. </T3>EPA is proposing MCLGs for nitrate and nitritethat are identical to those in the November 1985 notice. These levels are10 mg/l for nitrate and 1 mg/l for nitrite. (Note: In relation to drinkingwater, both nitrate and nitrite are commonly reported as nitrogen ratherthan as nitrate (NO3) or nitrite (NO2), per se; 10 mg/l of nitrate measuredas nitrogen is equivalent to 45 mg/l nitrate.) The levels for nitrate andnitrite in this notice are stated in terms of these two compounds measuredas nitrogen. EPA is also proposing an MCLG for total nitrate and nitriteof 10 mg/l, i.e., the sum of nitrate and nitrite may not exceed 10 mg/l.The MCLG for total nitrate and nitrite was not proposed in the November1985 notice. As described in the November 1985 proposal, the toxicity of nitrate inhumans is due to the reduction of nitrate to nitrite in the human body.By reacting with hemoglobin, nitrite forms methemoglobin (met Hb) whichwill not transport oxygen to the tissues and thus can lead to asphyxia(i.e., blue babies) which, if sufficiently severe, can lead to death. Regarding met Hb concentration levels which would be of concern, approximately1% of circulating hemoglobin normally exists in the form of met Hb. Clinicalsymptoms occur at approximately 10 percent met Hb and a 50-75 percent levelof met Hb results in death (NAS, 1972. Accumulation of Nitrate. NationalResearch Council). Infants are the population most sensitive to the acutelytoxic effects of nitrate and nitrite for a variety of reasons includinggreater water consumption/kg body weight, increased percent conversionof nitrate to nitrite and greater sensitivity of hemoglobin. The current standard for nitrate is based on the previous Public HealthStandard which, in turn, was based on a literature survey (Walton, G. 1951.``Survey of Literature Relating to Infant Methemoglobinemia Due to NitrateContaminated Water.'' <T3>Am. J. Pub. Health </T3>41:986-996). Walton observed that while seriousmethemoglobinemia, including death, was observed in infants exposed tohigh levels of nitrate, no cases were observed in infants exposed to 10mg/l or less of nitrate (i.e., a NOAEL). The proposed standard is somewhatmore stringent than the current MCL of 10 mg/l because it includes an MCLfor nitrite (the more toxic form) and a joint standard of 10 mg/l for nitrateand nitrite. EPA has reviewed the literature and concluded that an MCLG for nitrateof 10 mg/l is at a level at which there would be no adverse effects andwhich would allow an adequate margin of safety, because the available studiesprovide no evidence that any adverse health effect is seen at nitrate levelsof 10 mg/l or below (EPA, Health Criteria Document on Nitrate/Nitrite).Further, this conclusion is supported by the separate analysis of otherswho have reviewed the current literature. With respect to methemoglobinemiaand teratagenic effects and reproductive effects, Fan et al. (Fan, A.C.,Willhite, C.C., Book, S.A. 1987. ``Evaluation of the Nitrate Drinking WaterStandard with Reference to Infant Methemoglobinemia and Potential ReproductiveToxicity.'' <T3>Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology </T3>7:135-148) have recentlyreviewed the current literature and concluded that ``10 ppm nitrate-nitrogen,adequately protects the very young from nitrate-induced toxicity, bothpre- and postnatally.''When an MCLG is derived based on human data, EPA normally applies an uncertaintyfactor of 10 (for intraspecies variability) to ensure that the MCLG isadequately protective of the most sensitive members of the population.However, in this case, the Agency does not believe that an uncertaintyfactor is warranted because (1) the standard is designed to protect themost sensitive population (i.e., infants), (2) the studies covered a largenumber of subjects, and (3) the current standard has been in effect inthis country for decades with no cases of methemoglobinemia reported frompublic drinking water supplies. Because there is considerably less dataavailable on nitrite and due to the demonstrated direct toxicity of thischemical, EPA is applying an uncertainty factor of 10 to derive the proposedMCLG for nitrite 1 of mg/l. EPA is also proposing a joint standard of 10 mg/l: the sum of the concentrationof nitrate and nitrite cannot exceed 10 mg/l. Since both nitrate and nitriteresult in met Hb, it is possible that the toxicity of nitrate and nitritemay be additive. EPA is proposing the joint nitrate/nitrite standard inorder to account for the possible additive toxicity of these two chemicalsand also to protect against the deterioration of the drinking water quality,since the presence of nitrite in water is indicative of water contaminatedwith sewage. The combined standard does not supplant the individual standards for nitrateand nitrite. In summary, the following MCLGs are proposed: the concentrationof nitrate shall not exceed 10 mg/l (as nitrogen), the concentration ofnitrite shall not exceed 1 mg/l (as nitrogen), and the sum of the concentrationof nitrate and nitrite shall not exceed 10 mg/l (as nitrogen). <T3>Science Advisory Board Comments: </T3>The Science Advisory Board (SAB,1987) commented on the proposed nitrate/nitrite standard based on a reviewof the Draft Health Criteria Document on Nitrate/Nitrite. A summary ofthe SAB comments and the EPA response follows. a. The SAB concluded that ``the Agency can appropriately set a proposedhealth advisory level on the basis of methemoglobin formation.'' <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA agrees since the Agency believes that methemoglobinis the appropriate basis for the standard. b. The SAB recommended that a more extensive analysis should be providedof Walton (1951) which was one of the bases of the standard. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>As noted above, Walton (1951) was the basis forthe Public Health Standard relied upon by EPA when it adopted the current 10 mg/l nitrate standard. In addition, substantial new information sincethe Walton study was considered in the EPA Nitrate/Nitrite Health CriteriaDocument (EPA, 1987). This information further supports EPA's conclusionthat a 10 mg/l nitrate standard is protective. c. The SAB recommended that EPA should place the total exposure to nitrateand nitrite (i.e., contributions from water, and diet, etc.) into betterperspective. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA has analyzed nitrate/nitrite exposure throughvarious pathways. That analysis is described in a document entitled ``EstimatedNational Occurrence and Exposure to Nitrate/Nitrite in Public DrinkingWater Supplies''. Available information indicates that adults who consumenitrate at the proposed standard of 10 mg/l would receive approximately50% of their nitrate from drinking water and 50% from the diet. d. The SAB noted that the margin of safety (i.e., uncertainty factor) usedby EPA may not be adequate to protect ``sensitive members of the population,namely, infants with gastrointestinal disease.'' <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA believes that the standard of 10 mg/l containsan adequate margin of safety to protect sensitive members of the population,namely, infants with gastrointestinal disease. This conclusion is supportedby numerous analyses of the scientific literature. For example, both theWorld Health Organization (Guidelines for Drinking Water and Other SupportingInformation, 1984, WHO, Geneva, pg. 128-134) and the Canadian Departmentof Health and Welfare (Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality,Supporting Documentation, 1978, pg. 419-431, Minister of Supplies and Services,Canada, 1980) concluded that infant methemoglobinemia has not been reportedwhere drinking water contains less than 10 mg/l nitrate. e. The SAB noted that there is a lack of data on the reproductive and developmentaleffects of nitrate and nitrite. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>While EPA believes that more data should be generatedregarding reproductive and developmental effects of nitrate/nitrite indrinking water, the Agency believes sufficient data exist to conclude thatdevelopmental and reproductive effects are not evident at the 10 mg/l drinkingwater standard. See Fan (1987) and the EPA Nitrate/Nitrite Health CriteriaDocument (EPA, 1987). f. The SAB recommended that the Office of Drinking Water should set a singlepublic health standard for the contribution from both nitrate and nitrite.<T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA agrees and proposes a combined nitrate/nitriteMCLG of 10 mg/l. g. The SAB recommended that the Office of Drinking Water present a conclusionon the current knowledge of potential impacts of nitrosated materials indrinking water. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>As discussed elsewhere in this section, EPA believesthat there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that nitrosated materialsin drinking water present a cancer risk. <T3>Public comments: </T3>Sixteen individuals or organizations commentedon the MCLG proposal for nitrate/nitrite. Six commenters supported theproposed MCLG of 10 mg/l for nitrate. Another commenter contended thatno adverse health effects are seen until water levels exceed 45 mg/l, andanother stated that no standard should be set because there is no dataindicating that nitrate occurs at levels associated with this health risk.However, several other commenters believed that the proposed MCLG is toohigh, and should be reduced to a lower value (in the range of 2 to 3 mg/l)because (1) the proposed MCLG includes no margin of safety and (2) nitratemay be metabolized into carcinogenic nitroso-compounds. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>Regarding the statement on adverse effects of nitrateat levels above 45 mg/l, the commenter apparently has failed to recognizethat 45 mg/l nitrate is equivalent to 10 mg/l nitrate expressed as nitrogen.Thus, the proposed MCLG for nitrate of 10 mg/l expressed as nitrogen isidentical to 45 mg/l expressed as nitrate. EPA, therefore, agrees withthe commenter that adverse effects would not be seen until levels of nitrateexceed 45 mg/l (expressed as nitrate) or 10 mg/l (expressed as nitrogen).Nitrate concentrations of 10 mg/l or greater have been detected in over800 small, rural ground water systems. Because health effects are associatedwith levels of nitrate in excess of 10 mg/l, EPA disagrees with the commenterwho stated that there is no data which indicates that nitrate occurs atlevels associated with health risk. Furthermore, the SDWA Amendments directEPA to promulgate drinking water regulations for nitrate and nitrite. Regarding the two comments which stated that the proposed MCLG is set attoo high a level: (1) As previously discussed, the proposed MCLG of 10 mg/l as nitrogen containsan adequate margin of safety, as EPA has found no evidence of any casesof any adverse health effect associated with the consumption of water with10 mg/l or less of nitrate. This is based upon an extensive review of theliterature (EPA, Health Criteria Document for Nitrate/Nitrite) and decadesof experience with the current nitrate standard. (2) EPA is well aware that nitrate and nitrite present the <T3>theoretical </T3>possibility of an oncogenic risk, since nitrate isreduced in the human body to yield nitrite, and under suitable conditions,nitrite can react with nitrosatable compounds to form oncogenic N-nitrosocompounds. However, the evidence from human studies concerning the carcinogenicityof these compounds is inconclusive. There are several studies which showan association between nitrate and gastric cancer [Hartman, 1983. ``Review:Putative Mutagens and Carcinogens in Food.''<T3> Environmental Mutagenesis</T3> 5:111-121, as cited in<T3> Case Studies in Ground Water Quality Protection</T3>, prepared byR. Rajagopal et al. University of Minnesota, Duluth]. However recent epidemiologystudies do not show an association [Forman, D., Al-Dabbagh, S., Doll R.1985. ``Nitrates, Nitrites and Gastric Cancer in Great Britain.''<T3> Nature.</T3> Vol. 313. pp. 620-625; and Al-Dabbagh, S., Forman, D.,Bryson, D., Stratton, I., Doll, R. 1986. ``Mortality of Nitrate FertilizerWorkers.''<T3> Brit. J. Ind. Med.</T3> 43(8): 507-515]. Forman et al. (1985) correlatedthe incidence of gastric cancer with the levels of salivary nitrate andnitrite in humans. Salivary nitrate is a measure of total nitrate exposureand salivary nitrite is a measure of the levels of nitrite present in thestomach. The study found that there was an inverse correlation betweengastric cancer and salivary levels of nitrate and nitrite, i.e., the higherthe levels of salivary nitrate and nitrite, the lower the incidence ofgastric cancer. In addition, Al Dabbagh et al. (1986) observed that, infertilizer workers, the available data did not suggest that high nitrateexposure led to gastric cancer. Therefore, EPA does not believe there is sufficient evidence to concludeat the present time that nitrate or nitrite present a potential cancerrisk through drinking water exposure. Comment is requested on this issue.(3) Several recent studies have addressed the question of possible relationshipbetween nitrate and developmental effects. For example, Dorsch et al.,1984 (Dorsch M.L., McMichael, A.J., et al. Congenital malformations andmaternal drinking water supply in rural South Australia: a case controlstudy.<T3> Am J. Epidemiology.</T3> 1984. 119. pp. 473-486) have suggested thatthe consumption of nitrate in drinking water may present a developmentalhazard. The recent study by Arbuckle et al., 1988 (Arbuckle, T.E., Sherman,G.J., et al, Water nitrates and CNS birth defects: a population-based case-control-study,available to EPA as a preprint and subsequently published March, 1988 in<T3> Arch. Env. Health</T3>, V. 43, No. 2, pp. 162-167) does not supportthe conclusions of Dorsch et al. As previously stated, Fan et al. (1987),who reviewed the work of Dorsch et al., as well as significant other data,concluded that ``10 ppm nitrate-nitrogen, adequately protects the veryyoung from nitrate-induced toxicity, both pre- and postnatally.'' EPA is requesting comment on this information regarding reported potentialdevelopmental effects of nitrate and whether the proposed MCLGs provideadequate protection. Specifically EPA requests comments on the margin ofsafety and its adequacy to protect the public from these other potentialeffects. EPA is requesting comment on whether the MCLG should be lowered.8. <T3>Selenium. </T3>EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.045 mg/l for selenium in theNovember 1985 proposal. No new data which change the conclusions presentedin that notice have become available since its publication. EPA is thereforereproposing an MCLG of 0.05 mg/l for selenium (rounded from the proposedvalue of 0.045 mg/l). EPA is also requesting comment on alternative MCLGsof 0.02 mg/l and 0.1 mg/l for selenium, as discussed below. In the November 1985 proposal EPA calculated a DWEL for selenium basedupon a human study which examined selenium toxicity and deficiency effectsin China [Yang et al. 1983. Endemic Selenium Intoxication of Humans inChina. Amer. Jour. Clin. Nutr. 37:872-881]. EPA used a LOAEL of 3.20 mg/dayand an uncertainty factor of 15 resulting in a DWEL of 0.106 mg/l. EPAstated in the 1985 preamble that an uncertainty factor of 10 would normallyapply in this situation. However, that statement was incorrect, since theAgency normally uses an uncertainty factor of 100 when deriving the MCLGbased on a LOAEL from a human study. The Agency believes that use of theusual uncertainty factor is not appropriate here since, as discussed inthe 1985 proposal, selenium is an essential nutrient in humans. In casessuch as this, the Agency evaluates evidence of a compound's essentialityin addition to evidence on its toxicological effects in determining theMCLG. The NAS has estimated an adequate and safe level for adults at 0.05to 0.2 mg/l. Use of the larger uncertainty factor of 100, however, wouldresult in a level below that considered safe and adequate by the NAS (0.05mg/day) and therefore would not adequately protect against adverse effectsthat may result from selenium deficiency. EPA believes that the proposedMCLG adequately balances the potential deficiency and toxicity effectsof selenium. Data on human exposure was then factored in (0.125 mg/dayvia the diet and 0 mg/day via air), resulting in an MCLG of 0.045 mg/l.EPA is requesting public comment on whether it would be appropriate touse a relative source contribution factor of 20 percent, instead of factoringin actual human exposure data. EPA has used FDA Market Basket Surveys andother reports on selenium intake available in the literature to determinean average selenium dietary intake of 0.125 mg/day (See the Health CriteriaDocument for Selenium for the references on selenium intake). Since seleniumintake varies greatly depending on dietary exposures, EPA requests publiccomment on whether the above selenium dietary intake is representativeof actual human consumption. If public comments determine these data tobe nonrepresentative of actual human consumption, EPA would factor in arelative source contribution of 20 percent from drinking water, resultingin an MCLG of 0.02 mg/l. Although this level is slightly below the NAS'safe and adequate range (0.04 mg/day vs. the NAS' level of 0.05 mg/kg/day),EPA believes it is adequate to be protective against deficiency effects.EPA's Science Advisory Board reviewed the MCLG for selenium and suggestedthat the DWEL be raised to 0.16 mg/l, based upon the same calculationsas were used to set the proposed MCLG, except with the application of anuncertainty factor of 10 instead of 15. Use of this uncertainty factorwould result in an MCLG of 0.1 mg/l. The basis of the SAB recommendationwas as follows: (1) In the Yang <T3>et al. </T3>study, the LOAEL was 3.2 mg/kg/day and no lower valueshave been reported. (2) An upper limit of 0.2 mg/day (as cited in the NAS report) is not supportedby any of the data. (3) A daily intake of 0.214 mg/day (EPA's DWEL multiplied by 2 liters/day)is too close to the value needed for human nutrition and too far from thelowest value at which human symptoms occur. (4) There is little or no evidence for proposed human health effects suchas cancer or teratogenic effects. Selenium is not regarded as a human carcinogen.(5) Uncertainty factors should reflect likely beneficial effects as wellas harmful effects. There is limited evidence that selenium deficiencyis related to cancer and perhaps cardiovascular disease. Public comments are requested on this approach to setting the MCLG.<T3>Public comments:</T3> Ten individuals or organizations commented onthe MCLG proposal for selenium. Six commenters agreed with EPA's proposalof an MCLG of 0.045 mg/l for selenium. Reasons cited included the essentialityof selenium, its vital role in cell metabolism, the absence of acute humantoxicity and its low occurrence. One commenter stated that when seleniumis detected, interactions with other inorganics (e.g., arsenic, cadmium,mercury) should be considered. Three commenters disagreed with the proposed MCLG for selenium. One commenterstated that since selenium is an essential trace element and inhibits tumors,an MCLG that is too low actually increases the net risk of adverse healtheffects. The other commenter also felt that EPA was too conservative incalculating the MCLG and recommended using an uncertainty factor of 10(resulting in an MCLG of 0.1 mg/l). A third commenter stated that EPA shoulduse an uncertainty factor of 100 or more, since the MCLG is based on aLOAEL from a human study and since selenium is absorbed more efficientlyfrom water than from food. <T3>EPA response:</T3> EPA agrees with the SAB and the commenters thatit is appropriate to consider the essentiality of selenium and the otherfactors cited in developing the MCLG. EPA agrees that interaction betweeninorganic chemicals is an important consideration. However, at the presenttime there is not enough known about these potentially complex interrelationshipsto be used directly in calculating the MCLG. EPA applies uncertainty factorsin part to take into account possible synergistic effects. EPA does not believe that the MCLG is proposed at too low a level nor thatit would increase the net risk of adverse health effects such as tumors.The MCLG is set to protect against the potential toxic effects of seleniumand EPA believes that this level balances the essentiality of seleniumwith the potential toxicity of the compound. It is unknown at what levelsselenium may be protective against tumors in humans and thus EPA does notbelieve this consideration can be quantitatively factored into calculatingthe MCLG. EPA agrees that the proposed MCLG represents a conservative approach. EPA'suse of an uncertainty factor of 15 is consistent with the SDWA mandatethat MCLGs be set at a level protective of human health with an adequatemargin of safety. EPA is soliciting public comment on whether it may beappropriate to use an uncertainty factor of 10 with selenium. As discussedabove, EPA believes an uncertainty factor of 100 or more cannot be justifieddue to the essentiality of selenium. G. Proposed MCLGs for Synthetic Organic Chemicals 1. <T3>Acrylamide.</T3> EPA proposed an MCLG of zero in the November 1985notice for acrylamide based on carcinogenic risk and discussed the healtheffects and exposure data for acrylamide in detail. No additional datawhich change the conclusions presented in that notice have become availablesince its publication. EPA is therefore reproposing an MCLG of zero foracrylamide. <T3>Public Comments:</T3> A total of 12 individuals or groups commentedon the MCLG proposal for acrylamide. Two commenters stated that the DWELfor acrylamide should be 0.175 mg/l, based on a NOAEL of 0.5 mg/kg/day,as calculated in a study by Johnson et al. (1984), instead of the Bureket al. (1980) study in which a DWEL of 0.007 mg/l was calculated. Several commenters stated that it is inappropriate to set the MCLG at zerofor several reasons. These reasons included the assertions that: (1) Thecarcinogenicity data are weak and classification in Group B2 is inappropriate;(2) the available data indicate that there is little or no occurrence indrinking water, and EPA's estimate of the potential levels (0.0005 mg/l)is unrealistically high; (3) if acrylamide is a carcinogen, a risk of 10^5to 10^6, or 0.1 to 0.01 ug/l is reasonable for regulation; (4) there isno suitable analytical method; and (5) an MCLG of zero is inconsistentwith its use in water treatment and the MCLG will have serious impactsfor water treatment facilities. <T3>EPA Response:</T3> EPA has reviewed the Johnson et al. (1984) study(Johnson, K., Gorzinski, S., Bodner, K., Campbell, R. 1984. ``Acrylamide:A Two-Year Drinking Water Chronic Toxicity_Oncogenicity Study in Fischer344 Rats.'' Dow Chemical Company), which describes the results of chronicdrinking water exposure to acrylamide in rats. The Agency agrees with thecommenter that, based upon the evaluation of behavior, food and water consumption,body/organ weight ratio and conventional light microscopy, the NOAEL wouldbe identified as 0.5 mg/kg/day. However, the study by Burek et al. (1980)(Burek, J.D., Albee, R.R., Beyer, J.E., et al. 1980. ``Subchronic Toxicityof Acrylamide Administered to Rats in the Drinking Water Followed by UpTo 144 Days of Recovery.'' <T3>J. Environ. Pathol. Toxicol.</T3> 4:157-182), which identified a NOAELof 0.2 mg/kg/day, indicates that electron microscopic examination of peripheralnerve is a more sensitive endpoint of acrylamide neurotoxicity than islight microscopy. Therefore, since the study by Johnson et al. (1984) doesnot measure the most sensitive endpoint, that study is not appropriatefor derivation of a DWEL for acrylamide. In a subsequent study, Johnsonet al. (1985) [Johnson, K., Beyer, J., Bell, J., Schuetz, D., Gorzinski,S. 1985. ``Acrylamide: A Two-Year Drinking Water Chronic Toxicity_OncogenicityStudy in Fischer 344 Rats. Electron Microscopy Portion.'' Dow ChemicalCompany] reported electron microscopic observations made during serialsacrifices at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. These results also identify a NOAELof 0.5 mg/kg/day, but only for data up to and including the 12-month sacrifice;the 18 and 24 month data were judged to be indeterminate. Thus, the Bureket al. (1980) data has been used to calculate a DWEL. EPA believes it is appropriate to establish an MCLG for acrylamide at thistime; the SDWA Amendments direct EPA to promulgate a national primary drinkingwater regulation for acrylamide. The Agency is proposing an MCLG of zerofor the reasons stated in the November notice. With regard to the specificassertions by the commenters: (1) EPA has reviewed the carcinogenicity data on acrylamide and has concludedthat the B2 classification is appropriate, as the chemical tested positivein more than one species, in more than one strain in one of the species,and by more than one exposure route. (2) Although there are few data on the occurrence of acrylamide in drinkingwater, there is the potential for exposure to acrylamide as a residualmonomer from polyacrylamide which is used in water treatment. Under thecurrent voluntary drinking water additives guidance program, the maximumacceptable level of acrylamide in polyacrylamide is 0.05 percent weightby weight and the use level as a flocculant is 1 ppm. Assuming that allof the residual monomer will remain in water during flocculation, thiscould yield a maximum of 0.0005 mg/l acrylamide in finished water. However,levels are likely to be well below 0.0005 mg/l because chemical reactionsin water of trace residues would likely reduce the levels of acrylamide.Nonetheless, in light of the potential for occurrence and the health risksposed by this carcinogen and the mandates of the SDWA Amendments, EPA isproposing national primary drinking water regulations for this contaminant.(3) EPA is proposing the MCLGs for carcinogens at zero, for the reasonsoutlined in the November 1985 notice and elsewhere in this notice. Thisapproach has been upheld by the D.C. Circuit in <T3>NRDC</T3> v <T3>Thomas, supra.</T3> (4) EPA agrees that there is no suitable analytical method for acrylamide;however, the availability of analytical methods is not relevant to determiningthe MCLG, but was considered by EPA in proposing a treatment techniquefor acrylamide instead of an MCL. (5) The MCLG is a non-enforceable health goal and therefore has no impacton the use of acrylamide in the water treatment process. 2. <T3>Alachlor.</T3> In the November 1985 proposal, EPA proposed an MCLGof zero for alachlor based on carcinogenicity (Group B2). A detailed discussionof the adverse health effects and occurrence of alachlor is presented inthat notice. No new relevant data which change the conclusions presentedin that notice have become available since its publication. Therefore,EPA is reproposing an MCLG of zero for alachlor.<T3>Public Comments:</T3> Two commenters submitted comments on the proposedMCLG for alachlor. One commenter agreed with EPA's proposal for an MCLGof zero. Another commenter stated that it was inappropriate for EPA toset an MCLG for alachlor prior to the special review by EPA's Office ofPesticide Programs (OPP) and that the Office of Drinking Water (ODW) shouldfollow OPP's lead. If EPA determines that an MCLG must be established,then the commenter felt that a zero level is inappropriate and a minimumvalue of 0.005 mg/l was recommended. <T3>EPA Response:</T3> At the present time, OPP has completed three PositionDocuments (PD's) (1984, 1986 and 1987) on alachlor and completed the specialreview on this chemical. EPA believes there is sufficient information availableto justify setting an MCLG for alachlor at the present time. OPP's specialreview contains OPP's regulatory options on alachlor based on the sametoxicological data which ODW; has used to set the proposed MCLG. EPA isproposing MCLGs for carcinogens at zero, for the reasons outlined in theNovember 1985 notice. Since alachlor has been classified in Group B2 (probablehuman carcinogen), EPA is reproposing the MCLG at zero, not at 0.005 mg/las  suggested by the commenter. 3, 4, and 5.<T3> Aldicarb, Aldicarb sulfoxide, and Aldicarb sulfone.</T3> In the November1985 notice, EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.009 mg/l for total aldicarb residues(the parent compound as well as the sulfoxide and sulfone residues). Discussionsof the human exposure data and the health effects of aldicarb and its metabolitesare presented in the November 1985 proposal. This notice will discuss onlythe new data and conclusions that have been revised since publication ofthat notice. In the November 1985 proposal, EPA calculated a DWEL for aldicarb basedupon a study in which rats were administered aldicarb sulfoxide and aldicarbsulfone in the diet for periods of 3 to 6 months (C.S. Weil and C.P. Carpenter.1968a and b. Temik sulfoxide, Temik sulfone. Results of Feeding in theDiet of Rats for Six Months and Dogs for Three Months. Mellon InstituteReport 31-141 and 31-142. EPA Pesticide Petition No. 9F0798). A NOAEL of0.125 mg/kg/day was determined based upon a lack of significant decreasesin cholinesterase activity for aldicarb sulfoxide. Applying an uncertaintyfactor of 100 and assuming consumption of 2 liters of water per day resultedin a DWEL of 0.04 mg/l (rounded from 0.044). The MCLG in the November 1985 notice was proposed for total aldicarb, sincethe residues of aldicarb found most often in water samples are the sulfoxideand the sulfone. Toxicologically, the MCLG was calculated based upon studieson aldicarb sulfoxide since the sulfoxide is slightly more potent thanthe parent compound and significantly more potent than the sulfone as aninhibitor of cholinesterase. In this notice, EPA is proposing separate MCLGs for each individual compound.EPA is proposing that the same study which was used as the basis for theMCLG in the November 1985 notice be used as the basis for the proposedMCLG for aldicarb and aldicarb sulfoxide. The MCLG for aldicarb is proposedat 0.01 mg/l and the MCLG for aldicarb sulfoxide is also proposed at 0.01mg/l, rounded off from the value of 0.009 mg/l which was proposed in November.There is good evidence (based upon acute toxicity studies) that the toxicityof aldicarb is very similar to that of aldicarb sulfoxide. In addition,it is likely that the effects of the parent compound are due to the sulfoxide.Thus, EPA believes that the study used in the November 1985 notice is anappropriate basis for the MCLG for both aldicarb and aldicarb sulfoxide.EPA is relying on the same study to set the MCLG for aldicarb sulfone asis used to set the proposed MCLGs for aldicarb and aldicarb sulfoxide.The data for aldicarb sulfone from this study indicated a NOAEL of 0.6mg/kg/day based upon cholinesterase inhibition. Based on this NOAEL, aDWEL of 0.2 mg/l (rounded from 0.21 mg/l) and an MCLG of 0.04 mg/l wascalculated for aldicarb sulfone. EPA is requesting comment on whether a single MCLG could be set for totalaldicarb residues. This MCLG could be set based upon the most toxic componentof the mixture. In a short-term study [Mirro et al. 1982. ``Aldicarb Sulfone:Aldicarb Sulfoxide, Twenty-nine Day Water Inclusion Study Rats.'' MellonInst. Report andplusmin;45-18], a 1:1 mixture of aldicarb sulfoxide and aldicarbsulfone in the drinking water of young rats for 8-29 days resulted in astatistically significant reduction in cholinesterase activity in brain,plasma and red blood cells in both sexes at 1.8 mg/kg/day and in red bloodcells in males at 0.5 mg/kg/day at the end of the study period; however,no effects were noted at 0.12 mg/kg/day or below. This NOAEL, 0.12 mg/kg/day,is the same as that derived for aldicarb sulfoxide alone, although theintensity of cholinesterase inhibition with the 1:1 mixture at doses higherthan 0.12 mg/kg/day is lower than the level of inhibition noted at comparabledoses of aldicarb sulfoxide alone. Thus, it appears that the effect levelsfor these compounds in a 1:1 mixture reflect the inhibitory activity ofthe aldicarb sulfoxide portion of the mixture. Thus, for mixtures of thischemical and its metabolites, there are data which support basing an MCLGfor total aldicarb residues upon the most toxic component (i.e., aldicarbsulfoxide). Thus, such an MCLG for ``total aldicarb'' would be set at 0.01mg/l. EPA is also requesting comment on whether an alternate approach could beused to set an MCLG for aldicarb mixtures. One approach could be to basethe MCLG upon a fractionation of the total mixture depending upon the percentagecomponents of the mixture, ensuring that each individual component didnot exceed its individual MCLG. This would be calculated as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1(0,0,0),ns,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,i1,aw,26,1,19,1</C>  <H1>MCLG for Total Aldicarb</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>Aldicarb (measured)  </H1><H2>0.01 mg/l</H2><H1>+</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1(0,0,0),ns,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,i1,aw,29,1,26,3</C>   <H1>Aldicarb sulfoxide (measured)</H1><H2>0.01 mg/l</H2><H1>+</H1><H1>Aldicarb sulfone (measured)  </H1><H2>0.04 mg/l</H2><H1>andless;1</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <T3>Public comments:</T3> Six individuals or organizations provided commentson the MCLG proposal for aldicarb. One commenter agreed with EPA that theonly acute toxic effect of aldicarb is rapid and reversible inhibitionof cholinesterase.One commenter agreed that an MCLG should be established for aldicarb butfelt that a separate MCLG should be proposed for aldicarb sulfone. Thereasons cited were that toxicity data on aldicarb and aldicarb sulfoxideare inapplicable to aldicarb sulfone, adequate analytical methods existto distinguish between the three residues in water and EPA's OPP requiresseparate food tolerance regulations for aldicarb and aldicarb sulfone.One commenter stated that aldicarb residues should not be regulated becauseof the impractical test method. Another commenter stated that analyticalmethods are not readily available for aldicarb and a health advisory (insteadof an MCLG) should be set for aldicarb. One commenter agreed with EPA in the choice of the NOAEL for aldicarb andaldicarb sulfoxide, but disagreed with the choice of the uncertainty factor.This commenter felt that an uncertainty factor of no less than 10 and nomore than 40 for aldicarb and aldicarb sulfoxide was appropriate, basedon OPP's historical use of uncertainty factors. For aldicarb sulfone, thecommenter felt that an uncertainty factor of 10 was appropriate. One commenter agreed with EPA's decision to propose an MCLG that is protectiveof the 70-kg adult, while two commenters stated that by basing the MCLGon the 10-kg child, the 70-kg adult would also be protected. <T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA agrees that a separate MCLG should be establishedfor aldicarb sulfone and has proposed an MCLG of 0.04 mg/l for this compound.A discussion of the analytical method for aldicarb and its metabolitesis contained in Section IV of this notice. EPA's Risk Assessment Forum has developed Agency policy on the use of uncertaintyfactors for data describing cholinesterase inhibition as the most sensitiveendpoint of toxicity. OPP and ODW both follow the same policy in the useof an uncertainty factor of 100 with cholinesterase inhibition in the ratstudies for aldicarb and its metabolites, and an uncertainty factor of10 is applied to human data with cholinesterase inhibition. In the caseof aldicarb, similar MCLG values were obtained when the uncertainty factorsof 10 and 100 were applied, respectively, to the six month rat study andthe acute human exposure study (NAS, 1977). EPA believes that applyinga lesser uncertainty factor to animal data would not provide an adequatemargin of safety in light of the potent nature of the anticholinesteraseeffect and the steepness of the dose-response curve for this chemical aswell as human data discussed by the NAS in 1977. EPA believes that the uncertainty factor used in the calculation of theDWEL and the 20 percent relative source contribution would account forany difference in sensitivity and thus the MCLG would be adequately protectiveof the child as well. Public comments are requested on using the 70-kgadult rather than the 10-kg child as the basis for the MCLG. 6. <T3>Atrazine. </T3>EPA did not propose an MCLG for atrazine in the Novembernotice due to limited toxicological data on the chemical. However, sincethat time further studies have been carried out and EPA believes thereare now sufficient data upon which to base an MCLG for atrazine. EPA isproposing an MCLG of 0.003 mg/l for atrazine, based upon an evaluationof non-carcinogenic effects and a classification of the compound in GroupC_possible human carcinogen. The proposed MCLG is based upon non-carcinogenic effects in a one-yearfeeding study in dogs (Ciba-Geigy. 1987. Atrazine Technical 52-Week OralFeeding in Dogs. Study No. 852008 and Pathology Report No. 7048. MRID 40313-01).In this study, five-month old beagle dogs were fed atrazine at the followingconcentrations: 15, 150, and 1,000 ppm (corresponding to 0.48, 4.97, and33.65 mg/kg/day). A NOAEL of 0.48 mg/kg/day was identified, based uponthe finding of discrete myocardial degeneration at the highest dose leveland several findings at the 4.97 mg/kg/day dose level which suggested atrend toward the development of the cardiac pathology seen at the higherdose. An uncertainty factor of 100 was applied (consistent with the guidelinesfor use with a NOAEL from an animal study), and adjusted for the consumptionof 2 liters of water per day for a 70-kg adult, resulting in a DWEL of0.2 mg/l (rounded from 0.168 mg/l). A preliminary report submitted by Ciba-Geigy Corporation (previously referenced)in support of atrazine registration indicated that atrazine may be carcinogenic.Preliminary summary incidence information (1-year interim report) on thehistopathological findings of their 2-year oncogenicity study of atrazinein Sprague-Dawley rats indicated increased numbers of tumors in the mammaryglands of female rats. Also, the completed study reflected a statisticallysignificant dose-related increase in mammary tumors. A paper by Ciba-Geigy(1987) confirmed the initial findings. A study by Innes et al. (1969, ``Bioassay of Pesticides and IndustrialChemicals for Tumorigenicity in Mice: A Preliminary Note,'' J. Natl. CancerInst. 42:1101-1114) did not show carcinogenic effects for atrazine. Inthis study, the carcinogenicity of 120 test compounds, including atrazinein mice was investigated. A dose of 21.4 mg/kg was administered by gavageto mice of both sexes from age 7 to 28 days. After weaning at four weeks,this dose level was maintained by administering 82 ppm atrazine in thediet for 18 months. The incidence of hepatomas, pulmonary tumors, lymphomasand total tumors in atrazine-treated mice was not significantly differentfrom the controls. Recently a 90 week mouse oncogenicity study by Ciba-Geigy(1987) was submitted to the Agency. This study is also negative for oncogenicity.EPA has classified atrazine in Group C (possible human carcinogen) basedupon the results of the Ciba-Geigy (1986) study which show evidence ofcarcinogenicity of atrazine in the female rat. This evidence supports aGroup C classification based on EPA's cancer risk guidelines, i.e., limitedevidence of carcinogenicity based on studies involving a single species,strain, or experiment (see 52 FR 33992). An MCLG of 0.003 mg/l (rounded from 0.0034) was determined by applyingan additional uncertainty factor of 10 to the DWEL, to account for theclassification of atrazine in Group C and factoring in an assumed 20% contributionfrom drinking water, since adequate occurrence data are not available.EPA requests comment on the Group C classification for atrazine and theproposed MCLG. <T3>Public comments: </T3>No public comments were received on atrazinein the November 1985 notice. 7. <T3>Carbofuran. </T3>EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.036 mg/l for carbofuranin the November 1985 <T4>Federal Register </T4> notice. This was based upon a one-year dietarystudy in dogs in which a NOAEL of 0.50 mg/kg/day was identified, consideringthe absence of a biologically significant depression of cholinesteraseactivity or reproductive effect in the males. Using an uncertainty factorof 100, a DWEL of 0.2 mg/l (rounded from 0.175 mg/l) was calculated. Nonew relevant data that would change the conclusions presented in the Novembernotice have become available since its publication. EPA is, therefore,reproposing the MCLG at 0.04 mg/l (rounded from 0.035 mg/l). <T3>Public comments: </T3>Six individuals or organizations commented onthe MCLG proposal for carbofuran. One commenter stated that EPA shouldconsider the metabolites of carbofuran as well as the parent compound itselfin developing the MCLG, noting that toxicological exposure is the resultof a chemical metabolized in the body. Another commenter disagreed withEPA's statement that carbofuran may result in immune effects, stating thatthe evidence on this point is questionable. Four commenters stated that carbofuran should not be regulated becausethere is little or no occurrence in drinking water. Two commenters feltthat a health advisory should be issued instead, until further occurrenceinformation is available. One commenter stated that the MCLG should becalculated for the 10-kg child, since the endpoint of toxicity is an acutephenomena. <T3>EPA response: </T3>The MCLG for carbofuran is the result of the evaluationof all available toxicological data for carbofuran and its metabolites.Relatively few data are available in which the metabolites were directlytested. However, studies carried out on the parent compound inherentlyaccount for the metabolites, since the parent compound is metabolized inthe test animal and exhibits toxicity based upon its metabolized form.Thus, an MCLG based on data from the parent compound is adequately protectivefor the adverse effects due to the metabolites as well. Studies by Street and Sharma (1975) and Barnett et al. (1980) reportedsome changes in the immune system that raise questions on the potentialfor carbofuran to cause adverse effects on this system. EPA believes furtherresearch in this area is needed before any conclusions can be made on theeffect of this chemical on this toxicological endpoint. EPA agrees that occurrence of carbofuran is low in drinking water, butbelieves it is appropriate to set an MCLG based on its adverse health effectsand the potential for occurrence in drinking water. In addition, the SDWAAmendments of 1986 mandate that a MCLG and a national primary drinkingwater standard be set for carbofuran. EPA has based the MCLG on the NOAELfrom a one-year dietary study with dogs; the endpoints of toxicity in thisstudy were cholinesterase inhibition and testicular degeneration. Withthe addition of an uncertainty factor of 100 and a relative source contributionof 20 percent, the MCLG is considered to be adequately protective for the10-kg child. Further, the proposed MCLG (40 ug/l) is more protective tothe child than the computed child value based on the acute human exposurestudy (50 ug/l). 8. <T3>Chlordane. </T3>EPA proposed an MCLG of zero for chlordane based onsufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals (Group B2) in the November1985 proposal. No new data which change the conclusions presented in thatnotice have become available since its publication. EPA is, therefore,reproposing an MCLG of zero for chlordane. EPA has received new data regarding the toxicity of chlordane. While theproposed MCLG of zero is based on the carcinogenicity of this contaminant,the new toxicity data are presented to provide information on the fullrange of adverse effects of chlordane. EPA calculated a DWEL of 0.03 mg/lfor chlordane in the November proposal, based upon a two-year feeding studyin dogs. The results of a chronic rat dietary study (Yonemura et al., 1983;Thirty-month Chronic Toxicity and Tumorigenicity Test in Rats by Chlordane;submitted to OPP) were used to calculate a revised DWEL. This study wasconducted in 1983 but was not submitted to the Agency until 1985. In thisstudy, F344 rats were fed technical chlordane at dietary levels of 0, 1,5 or 25 ppm for 130 weeks. Regional hypertrophy was observed in femalerats at a dosage of 0.273 mg/kg/day. A NOAEL of 0.055 mg/kg/day was identifiedbased on liver hypertrophy. Applying an uncertainty factor of 1,000, (100for the inter and intraspecies difference and ten for the lack of a secondchronic toxicity study-reproductive study), a revised DWEL of 0.002 mg/lhas been derived, assuming consumption of 2 liters of water per day bya 70-kg adult. Since chlordane has sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity,this DWEL has not been used to set the MCLG. <T3>Public Comments: </T3>No public comments were received on the proposedMCLG for chlordane. 9. <T3>Dibromochloropropane (DBCP). </T3>EPA proposed an MCLG of zero forDBCP based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals (GroupB2) in the November 1985 <T4>Federal Register </T4> notice. No new data which change the conclusionspresented in that notice have become available since its publication. EPAis, therefore, reproposing an MCLG of zero for DBCP.<T3>Public Comments: </T3>Five individuals or organizations commented onthe MCLG proposal for DBCP. Two commenters submitted an alternate riskassessment for DBCP. A maximum likelihood risk of cancer of 4.6andmultiply;10^\6\for lifetime exposure to drinking water containing 0.1 mg/l was calculatedfrom the geometric mean of five risk estimates using different risk assessmentmodels. Although the commenters and EPA used the same chronic study todevelop risk estimates, different mathematical modeling was used in therisk assessments. The commenters urged EPA to set the MCLG at 0.1 mg/lbased on their risk assessment. In addition, they stated that additionalanalysis of metabolites is needed and that the available epidemiologicdata do not support an association between DBCP exposure and tumor formationin humans. One commenter asserted that the occurrence information provided in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>notice was not adequate, since dates and locationsof sampling were not described nor were detection limits or measured valuesgiven. One commenter agreed with the proposal. Another commenter stated that thereappears to be sufficient preliminary data available to warrant considerationof DBCP for regulation, but that additional research is needed before promulgationof an MCLG/MCL for this compound. <T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA cannot adopt the commenter's revised risk assessment.There is no biostatistical basis for this risk assessment procedure, andthe probit model used as one of the 5 models skews the risk estimate toan unreasonably low value. Also, EPA believes the 95% upper bound to bea more appropriate normalizing method than maximum likelihood estimates.However, EPA acknowledges that, as noted by the commenter, additional analysisof metabolites would strengthen the unit risk value. However, EPA doesnot believe that this analysis is essential to setting a risk number ofDBCP. By EPA's risk assessment procedure, an exposure of 0.1 mg/l willresult in an upper bound risk value of 4andmultiply;10^\3\. Furthermore,as EPA has explained in the November 1985 notice and elsewhere in thisnotice, the Agency has decided to establish a zero MCLG for contaminants,such as carcinogens, for which no threshold for adverse effects has beenidentified (<T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>Thomas</T3>, 824 F.2d 1211 (D.C. Cir. 1987)). Regarding the epidemiology data on DBCP, EPA believes that the epidemiologydata base is inadequate to refute or demonstrate that DBCP causes tumorsin humans. EPA believes there are sufficient data to conclude that DBCPis carcinogenic in animals since the compound has been shown to be carcinogenicin both rats and mice. EPA therefore has classified DBCP in Group B2: probablehuman carcinogen. Regarding the occurrence data presented by EPA, the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice was intended to present only a summaryof the data. A detailed presentation of the data may be found in the occurrencesupport document, which is available in the public docket. EPA disagrees that the health data are currently inadequate to establishan MCLG. DBCP has been shown to exhibit acute and chronic toxic effectsin animal studies, reproductive effects in humans and has also been shownto be carcinogenic in animal studies. 10. <T3>o-Dichlorobenzene. </T3>In the November 1985 proposal, EPA proposedan MCLG of 0.62 mg/l for o-dichlorobenzene based on the occurrence of liverand kidney lesions and porphyria in rats. EPA discussed the relevant toxicologicdata in detail in that notice. EPA also discussed the lack of adequatetoxicological data for m-dichlorobenzene, and declined at that time topropose an MCLG for the meta isomer. Instead, EPA sought data and commentson the appropriateness of setting a standard for m-dichlorobenzene basedon the toxicity data from o-dichlorobenzene. No new relevant data whichchange the conclusions presented in that notice have become available sinceits publication. EPA is therefore reproposing the MCLG of 0.6 mg/l foro-dichlorobenzene (rounded from the proposed value of 0.62 mg/l), and isnot proposing an MCLG for m-dichlorobenzene. <T3>Public comments: </T3>Four individuals or organizations submitted commentson EPA's proposed actions on o- and m-dichlorobenzene. One commenter agreedwith the proposal. One commenter believed that no MCLG should be developedfor o-dichlorobenzene because it is infrequently detected in drinking water,and when it is detected, the levels are well below the DWEL. Another commenterstated that it is appropriate to base an MCLG for m-dichlorobenzene onthe data on the ortho isomer, but as an interim step only. Another commenterdisagreed with basing an MCLG for m-dichlorobenzene on the data on theortho isomer, because the meta isomer is rarely found in drinking waterand because there are few data relating the meta and ortho isomers to oneanother. <T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA agrees that o-dichlorobenzene is infrequentlydetected in drinking water supplies and meta even less so. However, EPAis required to establish a standard for this compound under the provisionsof the 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. In addition, o-dichlorobenzenehas been detected in wastewater and hazardous waste and thus the potentialexists for drinking water contamination. The infrequent occurrence hasbeen taken into account in the proposed monitoring requirements (see SectionVI). EPA is not proposing an MCLG for m-dichlorobenzene at the presenttime because of the lack of data, but may develop a standard in the futureas data become available. 11 and 12. <T3>cis-1,2-Dichloroethylene and trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene. </T3>EPA proposedan MCLG of 0.07 mg/l for both cis- and trans-1,2-dichloroethylene in theNovember 1985 proposal based upon a two-year study on 1,1-dichloroethylenein which a DWEL of 0.4 mg/l (rounded from 0.35 mg/l) was determined. Atthat time, compound-specific data were not available for either cis- ortrans-1,2-dichloroethylene, and thus data on 1,1-dichloroethylene wereused to set the MCLGs for both compounds. Since the time of the proposal,compound-specific data on trans-1,2-dichloroethylene have become available,and this data has been used to determine the DWEL and MCLG for trans-1,2-dichloroethylene.No new data are available on cis-1,2-dichloroethylene, and thus the MCLGis reproposed at 0.07 mg/l.The MCLG for trans-1,2-dichloroethylene is based on a study by Barnes etal. (Barnes et al. 1985. Toxicology of trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene in theMouse. Drug Chem. Toxicol. 8:373-392) in which CD-1 mice (15-24/sex/dose)were given trans-1,2-dichloroethylene for 90 days in their drinking waterat levels of 17, 175 or 387 mg/kg/day for males and 23, 224 or 452 mg/kg/dayfor females. There were no changes in fluid consumption, body weight gainor gross pathology among the experimental groups. In male mice, significantincreases in serum alkaline phosphatase were noted at the two highest doselevels. In females, the thymus weight, calculated as percent body weight,was significantly depressed at the 224 and 452 mg/kg/day doses, while thelung weight was decreased only at the highest dose. A NOAEL of 17 mg/kg/dayin male mice was identified based on normal serum chemistry values in malemice. A DWEL of 0.6 mg/l was derived using 17 mg/kg/day as the NOAEL andan uncertainty factor of 1,000, based upon the use of a NOAEL from an animalstudy which is of less-than-lifetime duration. Factoring in a 20 percentrelative source contribution for drinking water results in an MCLG of 0.1mg/l for trans-1,2-dichloroethylene. EPA requests comment on whether the MCLG for cis-1,2-dichloroethylene shouldbe based upon the same data used to set the MCLG for trans-1,2-dichloroethylene.This would result in an MCLG of 0.1 mg/l for cis-1,2-dichloroethylene,instead of the value of 0.07 mg/l which is being proposed. <T3>Public comments: </T3>Five individuals or organizations commented onthe MCLG proposal for cis- and trans-1,2-dichloroethylene. One commenteragreed with the proposal. One commenter stated that an MCLG should notbe established for these compounds because there are no data to show thatexposure occurs or will occur above safe levels. One commenter stated that it may be sufficient on an interim basis to employdata on the toxicity of 1,1-dichloroethylene to derive an MCLG for cis-and trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, but that a concerted effort should be madeto develop data for these isomers that will be more reliable for derivationof MCLG values. One commenter stated that it is not reasonable to compare the health effectsof two compounds with similar chemical structure in the absence of chemical-specifictoxicity data. Another commenter felt that before establishing an MCLGof 0.07 mg/l for 1,2-dichloroethylenes, EPA should assure that biodegradationwill not produce vinyl chloride at concentrations greater than 0.001 mg/l.<T3>EPA Response: </T3>The Ground Water Supply Survey detected 1,2-dichloroethylenesin 3.4 percent of the random samples. Thus, EPA believes that there issufficient occurrence to warrant regulation for the 1,2-dichloroethylenes.(See Section VI). In addition, the SDWA Amendments of 1986 require thata drinking water regulation be set for cis- and trans-1,2-dichloroethylene.EPA agrees that chemical-specific data, when available, should be usedto develop the MCLGs. Since EPA has recently received data on the toxicityof trans-1,2-dichloroethylene following exposure by the oral route, thesedata have been used to set the MCLG for trans-1,2-dichloroethylene. EPA believes that basing the MCLG for a compound on the health effectsof compounds with similar chemical structure is appropriate when thereis insufficient data on the compound of concern and when available dataindicate that the compounds exhibit similar toxicity characteristics. Thereare data from shorter term exposures on all three dichloroethylene isomerssuggesting that they have similar toxicity in the qualitative sense, i.e.,they affect the same general organ systems. In light of this data reflectingsimilar structure activity relationships, EPA believes it is reasonableto use data on 1,1-dichloroethylene until such time as isomer-specificdata becomes available on cis-1,2-dichloroethylene. EPA does not believe that the MCLG for the 1,2-dichloroethylenes shouldbe based on their conversion to vinyl chloride. A drinking water MCL hasbeen set for vinyl chloride at 0.002 mg/l (see 52 FR 25690); the vinylchloride MCL will adequately protect the public against any vinyl chloridewhich may be produced through the biodegradation of the 1,2-dichloroethylenes.As outlined in the vinyl chloride rule, water supplies must test for vinylchloride whenever the 1,2-dichloroethylenes are found. The 1,2-dichloroethyleneshave been shown to exhibit toxic effects in their own right and thus, theMCLG for this compound must adequately protect against these effects. 13. <T3>1,2-Dichloropropane. </T3>EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.006 mg/l for 1,2-dichloropropanein the November 1985 proposal. In that proposal, 1,2-dichloropropane wasclassified in EPA's Group C, and the MCLG was set at a non-zero level basedon the 10^5 carcinogenic risk level. Discussion of the available humanexposure data and health effects of 1,2-dichloropropane were presentedin the November 1985 proposal. Based on data which has become availablesince the 1985 proposal, EPA is revising the carcinogenic classificationof this contaminant to Group B2, probable human carcinogen, and is thereforereproposing an MCLG of zero for 1,2-dichloropropane. In this notice, thediscussion is confined to the conclusion and justification for EPA's revisionof the carcinogenic classification for the compound. The final NTP technical report (1986) on the toxicology and carcinogenesisstudies of 1,2-dichloropropane in F344/N rats and B6C3F<T2>1</T2> mice is available for the carcinogenicity evaluation of 1,2-dichloropropane.The report was not available at the time of the November 1985 notice. Theresults of the bioassay showed a statistically significant increased incidenceof hepatocellular neoplasms, primarily adenomas in male and female B6C3F<T2>1</T2> mice. The frequency of liver carcinomas alone was not significantfor males or females but there was an increase in tumors in both sexes(male: Control, 11/50; low dose, 16/50; high dose, 16/50; female: Control,1/50; low dose, 3/50; high dose, 4/50). There was no statistically significantincrease in tumors of any specific organ in F344 rats; however, there wasa dose-related trend (by life table analysis) on mammary adenocarcinomasin the female rats. The increased adenocarcinoma incidence in the femalerat is considered to be significant since the F344 rat has a relativelylow background occurrence rate for these tumors. Also, high mortality duringthe course of the bioassay may have precluded higher incidence observations(i.e., some animals that died may have developed tumors had they survivedfor the duration of the study).EPA believes that the results of the bioassay lend support for a GroupB2 classification for 1,2-dichloropropane by virtue of the positive responsein mice together with the dose related trend in mammary adenocarcinomasin the female rat. Other considerations are that 1,2-dichloropropane: (1)Has shown positive mutagenic activity in short-term tests, and (2) is metabolizedto 1,2-epoxypropane and chloroacetaldehyde. 1,2-Epoxypropane is thoughtto have carcinogenic potential since other epoxy compounds are known carcinogens.In addition, 1,2-dichloropropane has a structural relation to compoundswith known carcinogenic activity in animal test systems (1,2-dichloroethane,1,2-dibromoethane, and 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane). EPA believes thatconsidering the total weight of evidence, 1,2-dichloropropane should beclassified in Group B2. Comment is requested on this proposed classification. If after considerationof public comments and further evaluation of the data EPA decided to classify1,2-dichloropropane in Group C, the MCLG would be 0.006 mg/l, as proposedin the November 1985 notice. <T3>Public comments: </T3>Seven individuals or organizations commentedon the proposed MCLG for 1,2-dichloropropane. Several commenters opposeddevelopment of an MCLG for 1,2-dichloropropane. The major objection wasthat the occurrence of 1,2-dichloropropane in the environment is very lowand decreasing, and the environmental levels do not result in exposureto a significant portion of the population. Three commenters opposed the MCLG because they believed the toxicologystudies to be weak. The commenters also challenged the classification ofthis contaminant in Group C on the grounds that the NTP bioassay had notbeen validated, that the mouse tumor data alone was inadequate to supportthis classification, that the relevance of mouse liver tumors to carcinogenicrisk in humans is unclear, and the cancer frequency in the concurrent controlswas higher than in historical controls. One commenter agreed that thereare inadequate data to establish a DWEL. <T3>EPA response: </T3>While EPA agrees that the environmental occurrenceof 1,2-dichloropropane is likely to be limited, it has been found in wellsin California and New York, in one hazardous waste site and in the ambientair in several cities. EPA believes the occurrence is sufficient to warrantan MCLG for the compound. In addition, the 1986 Amendments to the SDWArequire that an MCLG be set for 1,2-dichloropropane. EPA believes that the data are adequate to form the basis for an MCLG andto support a carcinogenicity classification of Group B2. The final reportfrom the NTP bioassay has been peer reviewed and audited by NTP, and underthe conditions of the study, 1,2-dichloropropane was considered to be carcinogenicto male and female mice, although the effect in rats was equivocal. EPAconsiders mouse liver tumors to be sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity(see the EPA Guidelines for Carcinogenic Risk Assessment (51 FR 33992))and thus EPA disagrees with the commenter regarding the relevance of mouseliver tumors. Regarding the cancer frequency in the controls, the NTP studyhas been peer reviewed and audited and found to be adequate. The cancerfrequency in the controls does not invalidate the results. 14. <T3>2,4-D. </T3>EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.07 mg/l for 2,4-D in the November1985 proposal, based on adverse effects on the liver and kidney in testanimals. EPA based this MCLG on a NOAEL of 1 mg/kg/day, a safety factorof 100, and the assumption that a 70 kg adult consumes 2 liters of waterper day. EPA also assumed that 20% of total exposure to 2,4-D would befrom drinking water. No new relevant data which change EPA's conclusionshave become available since publication of that notice. EPA is, therefore,reproposing an MCLG of 0.07 mg/l for 2,4-D. EPA is also considering adopting an MCLG of 0.02 mg/l for 2,4-D. This isbased upon the same study as used to calculate the proposed MCLG, withthe application of an additional uncertainty factor of 3 to the calculations.This uncertainty factor would be applied to account for the fact that supportinglong-term data in dogs are not available for 2,4-D. <T3>Public Comments: </T3>Five individuals or organizations submitted commentson EPA's proposed MCLG for 2,4-D. One commenter requested that EPA includemore details on the analytical methods for 2,4-D in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> One commenter disagreed with EPA's human exposureassessment, citing very low occurrences in air and food, and low occurrencein drinking water. This commenter stated that most levels of 2,4-D in drinkingwater are at or below the detection limit and thus it was not appropriateto use a 20 percent drinking water contribution for 2,4-D. Two commenters stated that an MCLG should not be established for 2,4-Dbecause the health effects data are too weak, and one commenter statedthat establishing an MCLG should be postponed until ongoing toxicity studiesare completed. These commenters stated that studies other than those usedby EPA should be relied upon in developing the MCLG, and that the estimatedrelative source contribution of 20% estimated by EPA in the November 1985notice was inappropriate because air and food are not significant exposuresources. <T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA has included a more detailed discussion of theanalytical methods for 2,4-D in Section IV of this notice. Regarding drinkingwater exposure to 2,4-D, EPA agrees that 2,4-D has only been detected atvery low levels in drinking water supplies. In the absence of reliabledata to the contrary, EPA conservatively estimates that drinking watermight contribute 20% to total exposure. EPA has examined the occurrencedata presented by the commenter, but believes they are insufficient toestimate the relative source contribution and thus believes it is appropriateto use a 20% estimate for exposure. EPA believes that the available toxicity data on 2,4-D are adequate toform the basis of a regulation for the reasons outlined in the November1985 notice. Four human studies cited by the commenter as a more appropriatebasis for the MCLG are not valid for this purpose. Two were designed asmetabolism and fate studies and did not (i.e., by design) provide adequatetoxicity information. Another study used only one subject, and the fourthstudy was not useful because exposure levels were not known. 15. <T3>Epichlorohydrin. </T3>EPA proposed an MCLG of zero for epichlorohydrinbased on its carcinogenic potential in humans in the November 1985 notice.EPA has classified epichlorohydrin in Group B2: probable human carcinogen,based on positive results in several carcinogenicity bioassays with ratsexposed to epichlorohydrin via multiple routes of administration. Exposureby ingestion, either via gavage or drinking water, resulted in tumors ofthe forestomach and exposures via inhalation resulted in tumors of thenasal cavities. No new relevant data which change EPA's conclusions havebecome available since publication of that notice. EPA is therefore reproposingan MCLG of zero for epichlorohydrin. <T3>Public comment: </T3>Eight individuals or organizations commented onEPA's proposed MCLG for epichlorohydrin. One commenter provided additionalinformation on health effects and metabolism of epichlorohydrin, includingdata indicating that oxalic acid is not a likely metabolite of epichlorohydrin,that epichlorohydrin is rapidly absorbed, metabolized and excreted whengiven orally, and that the available data on central nervous system effectsare from Soviet studies which lack detail. This commenter asserted thatwhile epichlorohydrin poses risks to humans, it is not possible to quantitatethe risks at this time.Several other commenters disagreed with EPA's decision to establish anMCLG for epichlorohydrin, stating that exposure through drinking wateris low, even though epichlorohydrin-based resins are used in drinking watertreatment. Additional reasons cited by the commenters were that analysisfor epichlorohydrin is difficult and that the regulation would have anadverse economic impact. One other commenter disagreed that there is an adequate basis for the DWEL,and disagreed with the basis for the carcinogenicity risk calculations,urging EPA to rely on the study by (Wester et al. [Wester, P.W., van derHeiden, C.A., Bisschop, A., and van Esch, G.J. 1985. ``CarcinogenicityStudy with Epichlorohydrin (CEP) by Gavage in Rats.'' <T3>Toxicol.</T3> 36:325-329) as the basis for the carcinogenic risk calculationsrather than that by Konishi et al. (Konishi, T., Kawabata, A., Denda, A.,et al. 1980. ``Forestomach Tumors Induced by Orally Administered Epichlorohydrinin Male Wistar Rats.'' <T3>Gann.</T3> 71:922-933), and suggested that EPA use a risk level of10^4 as the basis for the MCLG. <T3>EPA response:</T3> EPA disagrees with the commenter that oxalic acidis not a likely metabolite of epichlorohydrin. EPA has relied on a studyby the same laboratory as that cited by the commenter, indicating thatoxalic acid is responsible for the renal toxicity of epichlorohydrin. Thedata submitted on absorption and metabolism of epichlorohydrin will beincorporated into the Health Criteria Document. EPA agrees that the Sovietliterature was incomplete, and the studies are included in the CriteriaDocument for informational purposes only (i.e., the studies are not usedas the basis for the DWEL or the MCLG). EPA believes the current data areadequate to calculate cancer risks for epichlorohydrin since the data consistof high quality dose-response information in animals. EPA believes it is appropriate to establish an MCLG for epichlorohydrinat this time. EPA's occurrence estimates are based largely on residue fromits use as a drinking water flocculant. While typical levels of epichlorohydrinin drinking water should be quite low because of likely chemical reactionsin water of trace residues, its common usage and thus the clear potentialfor contamination justifies the promulgation of NPDWRs for this contaminant.Furthermore, the SDWA requires EPA to regulate epichlorohydrin. The availabilityof analytical methods and cost considerations are evaluated by the Agencyin promulgating the enforceable MCL or treatment technique and monitoringrequirements. These factors are not relevant to the establishment of theMCLG. Regarding calculation of the DWEL, EPA believes the published literature,which contains several long-term studies, provides an adequate data basefor establishing the DWEL for epichlorohydrin. EPA agrees that the studyby Wester et al. (1985) is a valid study but EPA continues to use the studyby Konishi et al. (1980) as the basis for the quantitative risk estimatefor oral exposure. Forestomach tumors in rats were seen in both studies,but the drinking water exposure route used by Konishi et al. is consideredmore relevant than the gavage exposure route used by Wester et al. As EPAhas explained in the November 1985 notice and in other rulemakings, theAgency has decided to establish a zero MCLG for contaminants which haveshown sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity. Since epichlorohydrin hasbeen classified in Group B2, EPA has reproposed an MCLG at zero for thecompound. 16. <T3>Ethylbenzene.</T3> EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.68 mg/l for ethylbenzenein the November 1985 notice based on adverse effects on the kidney andliver in test animals. EPA based the MCLG on a NOEL of 136 mg/kg/day, anuncertainty factor of 1000, a factor of 5/7 to convert from 5 day per weekexposure (by gavage) to daily exposure, and an estimated water consumptionof 2 liters per day for a 70-kg adult. From these assumptions, EPA calculateda DWEL of 3 mg/l (rounded from 3.4 mg/l); because adequate exposure datawere not available, EPA estimated that the drinking water contributionwas 20 percent, resulting in an MCLG of 0.68 mg/l. No new relevant datathat would change EPA's conclusions have become available since the publicationof the November 1985 notice. EPA is, therefore, reproposing an MCLG of0.7 mg/l for ethylbenzene, rounded from the proposed MCLG of 0.68 mg/l.<T3>Public comment:</T3> Five individuals or organizations commented onthe proposed MCLG for ethylbenzene. One commenter agreed with the proposal.Two commenters felt that an MCLG should not be established because ethylbenzeneis infrequently detected in water; when present, is at levels below theDWEL; and there are no studies showing that ethylbenzene in drinking waterhas caused human health problems. The other commenter felt that the assumed20 percent estimated contribution from drinking water is arbitrary andoverly conservative.<T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA agrees that ethylbenzene is unlikely to occurin drinking water at levels approaching the DWEL. However, EPA is requiredby the 1986 Amendments to the SDWA to develop an MCL for ethylbenzene.EPA estimates a 20 percent contribution from drinking water when adequate,reliable data on human exposure are not available to make another estimate.This conservative approach takes into account the possibility of exposureto contaminants through other sources, even though that exposure cannotbe quantified. Since adequate data are not available to determine the proportionof exposure to ethylbenzene through drinking water, EPA assumes a 20 percentrelative source contribution. 17. <T3>Ethylene Dibromide (EDB). </T3>EPA proposed an MCLG of zero for EDBbased on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals (Group B2) inthe November 1985 <T4>Federal Register </T4> notice. EPA presented a detailed discussionof the adverse health effects and occurrence of EDB in that notice. Nonew relevant data which change the conclusions presented in that noticehave become available since its publication. Therefore, EPA is reproposingan MCLG of zero for ethylene dibromide. <T3>Public comment: </T3>Three individuals or organizations commented onthe MCLG proposal for EDB. One commenter disagreed with the MCLG, statingthat it should be set at a non-zero level based on quantitative risk assessmentsderived from mathematical models or based on a LOAEL with an appropriateuncertainty factor. One commenter stated that the Agency is using flawedtest data which is not sufficient for extrapolating risk to humans. <T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA believes that the available data are adequateto classify EDB in Group B2, probable human carcinogen and therefore anMCLG of zero is appropriate for the reasons explained in Section IIIB ofthis notice. 18. and 19. <T3>Heptachlor and Heptachlor Epoxide. </T3>In the November 1985 proposal,EPA proposed MCLGs of zero for both heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide basedon sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity (Group B2) in animals. No newdata which change the conclusions presented in that notice have becomeavailable since its publication. EPA is, therefore, reproposing an MCLGof zero for heptachlor and an MCLG of zero for heptachlor epoxide. EPA has revised the DWELs for heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide. Theserevisions do not affect EPA's conclusions about heptachlor and heptachlorepoxide carcinogenicity, but are presented to provide more informationon the health effects of these compounds. In the November 1985 proposal,EPA calculated a DWEL based on noncarcinogenic endpoints of 0.0025 mg/lfor heptachlor, based upon a 110-day feeding study in rats (Witherup etal., 1955) and a LOAEL of 0.075 mg/kg/day. However, a reanalysis of thedata indicate that a NOAEL of 0.15 mg/kg/day is more appropriate, basedupon a consideration of different endpoints. Using this NOAEL and an uncertaintyfactor of 300, a revised DWEL of 0.02 mg/l (rounded from 0.0175 mg/l) hasbeen calculated. An uncertainty factor of 100 was used to account for inter-and intra-species differences. An additional uncertainty factor of 3 wasused to account for the fact that the most sensitive toxicological endpointmay not have been determined in the study, i.e., very few endpoints wereexamined in this 1955 study. For heptachlor epoxide, a DWEL of 0.001 mg/l was calculated in the November1985 proposal, based upon a two-generation reproduction study in dogs.A reanalysis of the data has indicated that a 60-week feeding study indogs (Unpublished, 1958, Kettering Laboratory 60-week dog feeding study)is more appropriate for the derivation of a DWEL, since a larger numberof endpoints were examined in this study. In this study, animals were given0, 0.5, 2.5, 5 or 7.5 ppm heptachlor epoxide in the diet. Effects werenoted for both males and females at the 0.5 ppm (0.0125 mg/kg/day) doselevel of heptachlor epoxide. Using 0.0125 mg/kg/day as the LOAEL and anuncertainty factor of 1,000, a revised DWEL of 0.0004 mg/l has been derived.Since heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide have sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity,the revised DWELs have not been used to set the proposed MCLGs. <T3>Public comments: </T3>Four individuals or organizations commented onthe MCLG proposal for heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide. One commenterrecommended reclassifying heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide to EPA GroupC (possible human carcinogen) because rodents have an extremely high backgroundof liver cancer and are not appropriate surrogates for extrapolation tohumans. Three commenters stated that a single MCLG for heptachlor and heptachlorepoxide is adequate, since carcinogenic potential has been shown for both.<T3>EPA response: </T3>According to EPA's guidelines for classificationof carcinogens, Group B2 is used when there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicityin animals and inadequate data in humans. These guidelines also state thatmouse liver tumor data should be taken as sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity,unless specific information on the compound's toxicology would warranta different classification. The analysis of the data for heptachlor andheptachlor epoxide show sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in the mouse,as well as some evidence in the rat, a second species. This analysis consideredthe results of the NCI 1976 bioassay, based on the evaluation of slidesby independent pathologists. Thus, EPA believes a Group B2 classificationis justified. The relative toxic and carcinogenic effects of heptachlor and heptachlorepoxide vary with respect to dose levels in animals. In addition, bothof these compounds have been detected in drinking water. Thus, EPA believesit is appropriate to develop separate MCLGs for these chemicals.20.<T3> Lindane:</T3> EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.0002 mg/l for lindane in theNovember 1985 proposal, based upon a DWEL of 0.01 mg/l, an additional uncertaintyfactor of 10 (since lindane was classifed as Group C_possible human carcinogen)and 20% contribution from drinking water. No new data which change theconclusions presented in that notice have become available since its publication.EPA is, therefore, reproposing an MCLG of 0.0002 mg/l for lindane. <T3>Public comments:</T3> Six individuals or organizations commented onthe MCLG proposal for lindane. Several commenters disagreed with the establishmentof an MCLG for lindane, citing weak health effects data and low occurrence.One commenter suggested that rulemaking could be delayed since there isan MCL already in effect. One commenter stated that the MCLG should bezero for lindane since it has been demonstrated to cause malignant livertumors in two strains of mice. One commenter supported the classification of lindane in Group C and discussedthe use of alternate studies cited in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> to derive the DWEL. <T3>EPA response:</T3> EPA believes there are sufficient health effectsdata to support the proposed MCLG for lindane. Acute exposure to lindaneresults in neurological and behavorial effects. Subchronic and chronicstudies have shown a variety of effects, including liver hypertrophy, kidneytubular degeneration and interstitial nephritis. EPA recognizes that occurrenceof lindane in public water supplies is likely to be limited and has takenthis into account in the proposed monitoring requirements (See sectionVI). In addition, the SDWA Amendments of 1986 require that a drinking waterregulation be set for lindane. The existence of a current MCL for lindanedoes not justify delaying this rulemaking. The 1986 Amendments requireEPA to promulgate an MCL for lindane notwithstanding the current MCL. Regarding the carcinogenic potential of lindane, the only evidence of carcinogenicityis in mice. An effect has been reported in only one species, and accordingto the EPA Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment, this results in aGroup C classification. Therefore, a non-zero MCLG has been proposed forlindane. 21.<T3> Methoxychlor.</T3> EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.34 mg/l for methoxychlorin the November 1985 notice. The adverse health effects and occurrenceof methoxychlor are discussed in detail in that notice. The MCLG was basedon a rat study in which a NOAEL of 5 mg/kg/day was identified and an uncertaintyfactor of 100 was applied, resulting in a DWEL of 2 mg/l (rounded from1.75 mg/l). EPA also assumed that drinking water contributes 20% to theoverall exposure of methoxychlor. EPA is reproposing an MCLG of 0.4 mg/lfor methoxychlor (the number was rounded to 0.4 mg/l based upon a DWELof 1.75, instead of 1.7, which was used in the November 1985 notice). However,it should be noted that the Office of Pesticides Program (OPP) recentlyreceived a teratology study in rabbits (Kincaid Enterprises, Inc. 1986.MRID 00159929). EPA is currently reviewing  this study. The MCLG for methoxychlormay be changed if EPA determines that the study is appropriate for determiningthe MCLG for this contaminant. The study is included in the record forthis proposal and EPA requests comment on whether it should be relied uponin determining the MCLG. <T3>Public comments:</T3> Three individuals or organizations submittedcomments on the proposed MCLG for methoxychlor. One commenter agreed withthe proposal. Two commenters disagreed with proposing an MCLG for methoxychlorbecause of the lack of occurrence and exposure data. <T3>EPA response:</T3> EPA agrees that the available data indicate thatthe occurrence of methoxychlor in drinking water supplies is not widespread.However, EPA is required by the 1986 Amendments to the SDWA to set an MCLfor methoxychlor. The available occurrence data has been taken into accountin the proposed monitoring requirements for methoxychlor (see section VI).22.<T3> Monochlorobenzene.</T3> EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.06 mg/l for monochlorobenzenein the November 1985 proposal. Discussions of the available human exposuredata and health effects of monochlorobenzene were presented in the November1985 proposal. This notice will discuss only the new data and conclusionsthat have been changed since publication of that notice, resulting in areproposed MCLG of 0.1 mg/l. In the November 1985 proposal, EPA calculated a DWEL for monochlorobenzenebased upon a subchronic study in which rats and mice were administeredmonochlorobenzene five times weekly by gavage in corn oil. (Battelle-Columbus.1978. ``Chlorobenzene. Subchronic Toxicity Study in B6C3F1 Mice.'' Unpublishedreport; and Battelle-Columbus. 1978. ``Chlorobenzene. Subchronic ToxicityStudy_Fischer 344 Rats.'' Unpublished report.) A NOAEL of 125 mg/kg/day,a conversion factor of 5/7 to average exposure over a week, and an uncertaintyfactor of 1,000 were used, resulting in a DWEL of 3.0 mg/l (rounded from3.125 mg/l). An additional uncertainty factor of 10 was then applied, sincemonochlorobenzene was classified in Group C by the EPA carcinogenicityguidelines. This resulted in an MCLG of 0.06 mg/l, assuming 20 percentcontribution from drinking water. EPA presently believes a subchronic study in dogs given monochlorobenzenefive times weekly orally by capsule is the best study available to calculatethe MCLG. (Hazelton Laboratories. 1967. ``13-Week Oral Administration_Dogs.Monochlorobenzene.'' Final report, submitted to Monsanto Company. ProjectNo. 241-105; and Knapp, W.K., Busey, W.M., and Kundzins, W. 1971. ``SubacuteOral Toxicity of Monochlorobenzene in Dogs and Rats.''<T3> Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol.</T3> 19:393 (Abstract).) This study wasconsidered in 1985 for derivation of the DWEL but was not used due to theavailability of a newer study However, discussions with the investigatingpathologist concerning the interpretation of liver pathology in the dogstudy in which he stated that 55.5 mg/kg/day should be considered the LOAELand 27.25 mg/kg/day should be considered the NOAEL have resulted in supportfor a lower NOAEL for the compound. Thus, EPA now believes it is prudentto base the MCLG on the Hazelton dog study. Using this study, EPA has selecteda NOAEL of 27.25 mg/kg/day, since liver lesions attributable to treatmentwith monochlorobenzene were observed in dogs at doses above 27 mg/kg/day.Adjusting the NOAEL by 5/7 (because the dose was only administered for5 days per week), and applying an uncertainty factor of 1,000, a DWEL of0.7 mg/l (rounded from 0.694 mg/l) has been calculated. An uncertaintyfactor of 1,000 was applied since the study was of a duration significantlyless-than-lifetime. EPA also believes that monochlorobenzene should be classified in GroupD, rather than Group C as originally proposed. In the original proposal,the classification of Group C was based upon the results of the NTP bioassayin which monochlorobenzene increased the occurrence of neoplastic nodulesof the liver in the high dose male rats. Carcinogenic effects were notobserved in female rats or mice of either sex. Other evidence relevantto the carcinogenicity weight of evidence included the results of mutagenicityassays, with positive results in yeast and fungi and negative results inbacteria and cultured mouse lymphoma cells. EPA has reexamined these data and believes they are insufficient to supporta Group C classification. In the NTP bioassay, the incidence in neoplasticnodules of the liver in high-dose male rats was increased compared to controls.EPA no longer believes this increase to have statistical significance.The NTP only considered the incidence of neoplastic nodules in the analysisof the results and did not include in its results the presence of hepatocellularcarcinomas in two vehicle male rats. EPA's policy is to combine both malignantand benign tumors when analyzing data (see EPA's Guidelines for CarcinogenRisk Assessment, 51 FR 33992). Thus, when EPA combined the data on hepatocellularcarcinoma with the data for neoplastic nodules, the response in high-dosemales was reduced to borderline significance by only one statistical test.There was no increase in incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in malerats or of neoplastic nodules or hepatocellular carcinomas in female rats.These data are, therefore, judged to be inadequate for a Group C assessmentof carcinogenicity.EPA also believes that the mutagenicity data and other data relevant tothe weight of evidence provide inadequate support for a Group C classification.The formation of carcinogenic metabolites, either reactive intermediates(epoxides) such as 3,4-chlorobenzene oxide or benzene, had been proposedas a possible mechanism leading to monochlorobenzene carcinogenicity. Onfurther review and with input from EPA's Science Advisory Board, EPA hasconcluded that this is not the case. EPA's Science Advisory Board statedthat the mechanism of monochlorobenzene toxicity is not known. Neithermonochlorobenzene nor its metabolites induce DNA damage or mutations instandard mutagenicity assays. Epoxide intermediates either are readilyconjugated via a glutathione transferase pathway or spontaneously rearrangeto form chlorophenols which then undergo conjugation. Benzene is not formedas a metabolite; metabolism via other pathways also terminates with theexcretion of conjugated chlorophenols. Hence, EPA believes, with concurrence from EPA's Science Advisory Board,that a Group D classification is more appropriate for monochlorobenzene.In summary, EPA has recalculated a DWEL of 0.7 mg/l (rounded from 0.675mg/l), based upon a different study than was used in the MCLG proposal.Assuming a 20 percent contribution from drinking water results in an MCLGof 0.1 mg/l (rounded from 0.139 mg/l). EPA has reclassified monochlorobenzenein Group D, so an additional uncertainty factor of 10 was not applied.<T3>Public comments: </T3>Eight individuals or organizations commentedon the proposed MCLG for monochlorobenzene. One commenter felt that thestatement in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>that monochlorobenzene has been shown to causemutagenic effects in higher plants and certain microorganisms was a misrepresentationof the actual data, since mutagenicity studies have shown mixed results.Several commenters stated that no MCLG should be established for monochlorobenzenesince the occurrence is very low and the health effects data are very weak.Two commenters felt that the compound should be classified in Group D ratherthan Group C since the NTP bioassay detected only a small increase in livertumors in male rats, with no effect in female rats or in male or femalemice. One commenter supported the use of the subchronic study as the basisfor the MCLG, while another commenter stated that a rabbit study couldbe used to calculate the MCLG. <T3>EPA response: </T3>While it is true that older mutagenicity studiesin plants showed positive results, the more recent studies in animals andmicroorganisms have been negative. Thus, EPA believes that it is accurateto state that mutagenicity studies have shown mixed results, but the preponderanceof the evidence is negative. EPA believes that there is sufficient healtheffects information to support an MCLG for monochlorobenzene, since dose-responsedata are available from animal studies. EPA agrees that monochlorobenzenehas not been found to be common in drinking water samples, but the potentialfor drinking water contamination exists since the compound has been identifiedat five hazardous waste sites. In addition, EPA is mandated by the SDWAAmendments to establish an MCLG for monochlorobenzene. EPA agrees that monochlorobenzene should be classified in Group D for thereasons stated above. EPA does not agree that the rabbit study should beused to calculate the MCLG, since exposure was through the inhalation route,rather than ingestion. 23. <T3>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). </T3>In the November 1985 proposal,EPA proposed an MCLG of zero for PCBs based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicityin animals (Group B2). No new data which change the conclusions presentedin that notice have become available since its publication. EPA is thereforereproposing an MCLG of zero for PCBs. <T3>Science Advisory Board Comments: </T3>EPA's Science Advisory Board(SAB) has stated that EPA should regulate PCBs by regulating the most toxicindividual isomers. They have stated that a scale of toxicities for PCBisomers should be prepared and an ``equivalency approach'' developed, usingthe most toxic PCBs as the basis for comparison. EPA requests commentson this approach. <T3>Public comments: </T3>Seven individuals or organizations commentedon the MCLG proposal for PCBs. A number of commenters disagreed with theproposal of an MCLG of zero for PCBs for the following reasons:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Inadequate evidence to classify PCBs as Category I carcinogens. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Epidemiologic studies of exposed workers have not found significantcancer increases. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The FDA allows a tolerance of 0.013 mg/day. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Inadequate evidence of mutagenicity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Limited occurrence data. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Analytical methods detect only some PCB isomers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The MCLG is unattainable.</ITAG>Several commenters agreed that it is appropriate to set regulations forPCBs as a class of compounds, while one commenter stated that setting regulationsfor PCBs as a class is inappropriate because of significant health differencesin isomers. Another commenter suggested that enforcement and treatmentregulations should be based on those isomers with demonstrated adversehealth effects. <T3>EPA response: </T3>There are several animal studies which show PCBmixtures to be carcinogenic. As discussed in the November 1985 proposal,EPA believes these studies are sufficient to classify PCBs in Group B2,probable human carcinogen. EPA does not agree with the commenter that epidemiologicstudies are negative. Three recently published epidemiologic studies ofPCB-exposed populations reported statistically significant excesses oftumors of the lung, liver, gastrointestinal tract and hematopoietic system.However, these studies did not control for any potentially confoundingfactors and the number of exposed individuals was small. Thus, the epidemiologicdata are suggestive, but are not conclusive in terms of PCBs as the soleetiologic agent for these types of cancer. Mutagenicity studies have shownmixed results, with some positive evidence; thus, EPA disagrees with thecommenter's characterization of the mutagenicity evidence as inadequate.However, EPA has relied on the animal carcinogenicity data, not the mutagenicitydata, in setting the MCLG for PCBs. EPA does not believe that the FDA tolerance should be used as the basisfor the MCLG, since FDA tolerances are developed for different uses andhave a different basis from drinking water standards. The MCLG is basedon health effects data only, and does not consider the availability ofanalytical methods or the feasibility of attaining the MCLG. EPA agreesthat PCBs have not been found to have widespread occurrence in drinkingwater, but believes the evidence of adverse health effects and limitedoccurrence is sufficient to warrant an MCLG. In addition, the SDWA Amendmentsdirect EPA to set a regulation for PCBs. The MCLG is a nonenforceable health goal, and thus the fact that zero isunattainable is not relevant to setting the MCLG. EPA agrees that differences exist in health effects between the isomersbut does not agree that the MCLG should be based on a specific isomer insteadof on PCBs as a class of compounds. It would be impossible to regulatespecific isomers since technical or commercial grade PCBs are mixed isomersfrom 10 classes of chlorobiphenyls containing 209 possible isomers. 24. <T3>Pentachlorophenol. </T3>EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.2 mg/l for pentachlorophenolin the November 1985 proposal. This was based upon an DWEL of 1 mg/l (roundedfrom 1.05 mg/l) calculated from a 24-month feeding study in rats with aNOAEL of 3 mg/kg/day, an uncertainty factor of 100 and a 20 percent drinkingwater contribution. Pentachlorophenol was classified in EPA's Group D.However, recent positive carcinogenicity data may lead to a revision ofthe MCLG.The NTP recently completed a carcinogenicity bioassay on technical andpurified commercial grades of pentachlorophenol in mice. The draft report[NTP Technical Report on the Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Pentachlorophenol(CAS no. 87-86-5) in B6C3F<T2>1</T2> Mice (Feed Studies); Draft Report, April, 1988] showed dose-relatedincreases in three tumor types (hemangiosarcomas, adrenal pheochromocytomas,and carcinomas and adenomas) of the liver and adrenal tumors in males andfemales with both grades of the compound. EPA has concluded that this studywould support reclassification of pentachlorophenol into Group B2 (sufficientevidence in animals) since the multiple tumor types at different dose levelsin both sexes of mice satisfies the criteria for sufficient evidence forcarcinogenicity in animals. Thus, EPA requests comment on an MCLG of zerofor pentachlorophenol, based on the revised classification of B2 indicatingsufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals. <T3>Public comments:</T3> Six individuals or organizations commented onthe MCLG proposal for pentachlorophenol. One commenter requested that EPAdiscuss the analytical procedures for the measurement of pentachlorophenolconcentrations in drinking water in more detail. Another commenter assertedthat some pentachlorophenol is present as a result of biodegradation ofpesticides, that 97 percent of it is used for wood treatment, and thatits use on wood is not recommended where it will come into contact withpotable water. One commenter noted a specific health effects study thatshould also be included in the Health Criteria Document, and discussedanother study in which a low LD<T2>50</T2> value which was reported in the Health Criteria Document mightpossibly be due to dioxin or dibenzofuran contamination. The commenterstated that the probable cause of the toxicity was the fuel oil vehicle.Several commenters stated that an MCLG should not be established for pentachlorophenoldue to data which indicate that the health effects are based on furan anddioxin impurities in the pentachlorophenol, and the fact that the occurrenceof pentachlorophenol in water is low. One commenter disagreed with theNOAEL of 3 mg/kg/day employed in the calculation of the MCLG. <T3>EPA response:</T3> The analytical procedures for pentachlorophenolare discussed in more detail in Section IV. EPA agrees with the commenter'spoints on human exposure data on pentachlorophenol, i.e., that the occurrenceof pentachlorophenol in rivers and streams comes from degradation productsand that greater than 97 percent of pentachlorophenol is used in the treatmentof wood. This information has been incorporated in EPA's report on theoccurrence of pentachlorophenol. EPA agrees with the commenter that the additional health effects studyshould be included in the Health Criteria Document and the fact that thefuel oil vehicle was a probable reason for the low LD<T2>50</T2>. This study and explanation have been added to the Health CriteriaDocument. EPA believes that it is appropriate to set a standard for pentachlorophenol.2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was not detected in commercial pentachlorophenolused to set the MCLG. EPA agrees that occurrence and exposure data on pentachlorophenolare limited, but the compound has been detected in rivers and streams andpentachlorophenol has been identified at one hazardous waste site. In addition,the 1986 SDWA Amendments direct EPA to set an MCLG for this compound. EPA disagrees with the commenter regarding the NOAEL of 3 mg/kg/day. Noeffects were seen in the Johnson et al. study [Johnson, R.L., Gehring,P.J., Kociba, R.J., and Schwetz, B.A. 1973. ``Chlorinated Dibenzodioxinsand Pentachlorophenol.'' <T3>Environ. Health Perspec.,</T3> Exp. Issue No. 5, Sept., 1973, pp. 171-175]at this dose level, while the 10 mg/kg/day dose produced increased liverweights. EPA thus believes 3 mg/kg/day is an appropriate NOAEL. 25. <T3>Styrene:</T3> EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.14 mg/l for styrene in theNovember 1985 proposal. This was based upon a study in which beagle dogswere given styrene in a peanut oil suspension by gavage 7 days/week forup to 561 days. A NOAEL of 200 mg/kg/day was used with an uncertainty factorof 1,000, resulting in a DWEL of 7 mg/l. An additional uncertainty factorof 10 was applied because styrene was classified in EPA's Group C. Datawhich change the conclusions presented in that notice have become availableand styrene has been reclassified in EPA's Group B2. The EPA Science AdvisoryBoard (SAB) reviewed the Drinking Water Health Criteria Document for Styrene(February 4-5, 1988) and provided written review comments (July 19, 1988).The extensive SAB review comments are currently being considered by theEPA. After consideration of the SAB review and public comment, the EPAwill reexamine this decision. Since the final cancer group classificationof styrene is still under consideration at the present time, the EPA isproposing MCLGs of 0.1 mg/l (based on a group C classification) and zero(based on a Group B2 classification) and requests public comments on bothproposed MCLGs. The reclassification to Group B2 is based on reevaluation of animal bioassaydata as well as new metabolism and genotoxicity data. The SAB does notagree that there is sufficient evidence to justify the reclassificationof styrene to EPA Group B2 and recommends continuation of the Group C classification.The EPA recognizes that the Group B2 classification is a matter for furtherconsideration within the Agency as well as by the public, due to differentviews on interpretation of the animal bioassay data. For example, the comparisonof exposed animals to concurrent controls versus historical control datacan result in different levels of statistical significance. Another criticalissue affecting the classification of styrene is the degree of emphasisto place on supporting metabolism and genotoxicity data. For example, thereis a wide range of opinions regarding the relevance of low levels of acarcinogenic metabolite (styrene-7,8-oxide) in humans exposed to styrene.The final outcome of reviews of supporting data will influence the weight-of-the-evidenceapproach detailed in the EPA's Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment.The evidence from animal cancer bioassays indicated an elevated incidenceof tumors in both rats and mice. In one study (Ponomarkov, V., and Tomatis,L. 1978. ``Effects of Long-term Oral Administration of Styrene to Miceand Rats. <T3>Scand. J. Work Environ. Health.</T3> 4(Suppl. 2):127-135), an increasedincidence of lung tumors was observed in male and female O<T2>20</T2> mice. Also, an increased incidence of liver carcinomas wasshown in male C57B1 mice administered styrene by gavage. In the NationalCancer Institute (NCI) bioassay of styrene, when study controls are considered,a statistically significant increase in lung tumors was seen in male B6C3F1mice with a positive dose-response trend (NCI Technical Report Series No.185, 1979). In an inhalation study [Jersey, G.C., et al. 1978. ``Two-YearChronic Inhalation Toxicity and Carcinogenicity Study on Monomeric Styrenein Rats.'' Dow Chemical Study for Manufacturing Chemists Association. Dec.6, 1978] the incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas was elevated in femaleSprague-Dawley rats. The EPA Guidelines for Carcinogenic Risk Assessment encourage the use ofadditional considerations to support or limit the strength of the bioassayevidence. In the case of styrene, the evidence for genotoxicity in short-termanimal tests and in humans occupationally exposed to the chemical alongwith recent data on the metabolite styrene-7,8-oxide is considered supportiveof carcinogenic potential. The new metabolism and genotoxicity data indicate that styrene-7,8-oxideis the initial metabolite of styrene in humans and animals and that itis a potent animal carcinogen. A recent study demonstrated the presenceof styrene-7,8-oxide in the blood of workers exposed to styrene in glassfiber-reinforced plastic factories. Supporting studies show protein andDNA adduct formation in various mouse tissues following styrene and styrene-7,8-oxideexposure. Covalent binding of styrene-7,8-oxide was demonstrated in mouseDNA from liver, lung and brain. EPA previously classified styrene in Group C based upon the limitationsof the animal cancer bioassays and supporting data. However, EPA now believesthat these animal studies, when considered together with the new metabolismand genotoxicity data, may form a sufficient basis for classifying styrenein Group B2.EPA requests comment on the possible health effects of styrene degradationproducts in water. Styrene is not stable under oxidizing conditions andconverts to chlorostyrene and other degradation products in water containingchlorine. Any information on these degradation products is requested. Commentis also requested on whether styrene should be classified as a Group Cor Group B2 carcinogen based upon the considerations outlined above. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently reviewedthe carcinogenicity of styrene (54 FR 2429). In that <T4>Federal Register </T4> notice OSHA indicated its belief that the currentevidence on styrene's carcinogenicity does not support its classificationas a carcinogen. OSHA has reviewed additional evidence and has determinedthat the most appropriate basis for classifying styrene in its rulemakingis styrene's demonstrated narcotic effect. In its criteria document, theNational Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) considersstyrene primarily a narcotic and central nervous system toxin. <T3>Public comments: </T3>Nine individuals or organizations commented onthe MCLG proposal for styrene. One commenter agreed that styrene shouldbe classified in Group C and that the DWEL was appropriate. One commenterstated that EPA has ample evidence to conclude that styrene is a potentialhuman carcinogen. The other commenters stated that styrene should be deletedfrom the proposed regulation because the potential for occurrence is questionable,no occurrence data exist, styrene is very poorly soluble in water and theorganoleptic threshold is lower than the adverse effect level. <T3>EPA response: </T3>The final carcinogenicity classification of styreneis being reviewed as discussed above. Styrene has been found in both surfaceand ground water and in drinking water supplies. Additionally, EPA suspectsstyrene will be released into drinking water as a result of the use ofcertain resins for water treatment, and thus believes there is sufficientbasis for establishing an MCLG. Furthermore, the 1986 SDWA amendments directEPA to establish an MCLG for styrene. Styrene has been detected in water, and thus EPA believes the solubilityof the compound is not an issue. Regarding the organoleptic threshold,MCLGs are based on health effects only; secondary maximum contaminant levelsare established to protect the aesthetic quality of water (including odor).EPA's proposed MCL of 0.1 mg/l is above the organoleptic threshold of 0.01mg/l. Consequently, EPA is also proposing a secondary MCL of 0.01 mg/l.26. <T3>Tetrachloroethylene. </T3>EPA first proposed an MCLG for tetrachloroethyleneon June 12, 1984 (49 FR 24330). Assessments based on both carcinogenicand noncarcinogenic effects were presented. EPA proposed an MCLG of zerobased on carcinogenic potential, but recognized the available data indicatedonly ``limited'' evidence of carcinogenicity in animals. The assessmentof carcinogenicity was based primarily on the 1977 NCI bioassay in whichrats and mice were administered tetrachloroethylene via gavage. Mice showedan increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Data on rats were equivocalbecause of excessive mortality. A DWEL of 0.085 mg/1 was also derived basedon noncarcinogenic effects. Public comments were received on the 1984 notice and the Agency responsewas published in the November 13, 1985 proposal. The 1985 proposal alsoincluded a reevaluation of the carcinogenicity classification. Both datafrom the 1977 NCI bioassay and a draft report on the 1985 NTP inhalationbioassay in rats and mice were available at that time. The inhalation bioassayalso indicated that tetrachloroethylene caused an increased incidence ofboth hepatocellular carcinoma and adenoma in mice of both sexes. In addition,an increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia and renal tubular adenomas/carcinomas(combined) were observed in rats. The NTP had also repeated the gavageadministration study in rats but this study was not validated followingan extensive audit. On the basis of these data, EPA stated on November13, 1985, that ``sufficient'' evidence of carcinogenicity in animals wasavailable and recommended that tetrachloroethylene be classified in GroupB2 (probable human carcinogen), according to the EPA cancer guidelines.Before reaching a final conclusion on the appropriate MCLG, EPA allowedan additional 45-day comment period for public comment on the draft NTPinhalation bioassay. Prior to the November 1985 notice, both EPA's Risk Assessment Forum andScience Advisory Board (SAB) had concluded that available data were notadequate to support a classification of tetrachloroethylene as a probablehuman carcinogen (B2). However, neither group had the opportunity to reviewthe draft 1985 NTP bioassay before publication of that notice. A reviewof the data on tetrachloroethylene, including the 1985 NTP inhalation bioassay,was subsequently conducted by the Halogenated Organics Subcommittee ofthe Science Advisory Board. The Subcommittee recommended that tetrachloroethylenebe classified in Group C: possible human carcinogen (U.S. EPA, ScienceAdvisory Board: Environmental Health Committee Halogenated Organics Subcommitteereport from N. Nelson and R. Griesmen to L. Thomas, January 27, 1987).In August of 1987, the SAB's Halogenated Organics Subcommittee held a scientificworkshop to discuss issues related to the toxicology of tetrachloroethylene(and other chemicals), such as the relevance of mouse liver tumors to humancancer risk. The SAB also examined the cancer classification of tetrachloroethyleneand concluded that the overall weight of evidence lies on the continuumbetween EPA's Groups B2 and C (U.S. EPA, Science Advisory Board: EnvironmentalHealth Committee Halogenated Organics Subcommittee report from N. Nelson,R. Griesemer and J. Doull to L. Thomas, March 9, 1988). EPA recognizes that, as with most chemicals, the evaluation of the carcinogenicpotential of tetrachloro- ethylene in humans has its controversial elements.Because no scientific consensus yet exists, it is necessary for the Agencyto make a judgment based on a reasonable weighing of evidence from thedata at hand. In addition to the positive evidence provided by both the1977 and 1985 carcinogenicity bioassays, weight of evidence considerationhas been given to other factors as well. Mutagenicity, metabolites andtheir mutagenic/carcinogenic potential and data on the epidemiology oftetrachloroethylene were evaluated with respect to tetrachloroethylenecarcinogenicity. The epidemiologic evidence is inadequate; the data areof insufficient quality to demonstrate either the presence or the absenceof an effect. Metabolic considerations, however, provide some support forpotential carcinogenicity since tetrachloroethylene epoxide, a reactivemetabolite of tetrachloroethylene, has been found to be mutagenic and spentTCA, a major metabolite, and spent DCA, a minor metabolite, show both humanpromoting and complete carcinogenic properties in a mouse bioassay. Mutagenicity data, in general, have been inconclusive or negative. Evidenceof liver tumors in both sexes of mice by two routes of administration,evidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in rats, and evidence of renal adenomas/carcinomasin male rats, which is viewed as suggestive at present given the concernsabout relevance to humans, along with supportive evidence of carcinogenicreactivity from metabolite considerations, and an inadequate epidemiologicdata base, provide a basis for classifying tetrachloroethylene in GroupB2, probable human carcinogen, and establishing an MCLG of zero.If one accepts a weighing of the evidence to be limited, along with theinadequate epidemiologic data base, tetrachloroethylene would be classifiedin Group C, possible human carcinogen. Under this classification, the MCLGwould be 0.01 mg/l, calculated using a NOAEL of 20 mg/kg/day, based uponthe absence of effects in mice (Buben and O'Flaherty, 1985. Delineationof the Role of Metabolism in the Hepatotoxicity of Trichloroethylene andPerchloroethylene. A Dose-Effect Study. Tox. Appl. Pharm. 73:105-122) andrats (Hayes et al. 1986. The Subchronic Toxicity of Tetrachloroethylene(Perchloroethylene) Administered in the Drinking Water of Rats. Fundamentaland Applied Toxicology 7:119-125), an adjustment of 5/7 (since the dosewas administered for 5 days per week), an uncertainty factor of 1,000,a 20 percent assumed contribution from drinking water and an additionaluncertainty factor of 10, to account for the Group C classification. EPA is proposing the MCLG for tetrachloroethylene at zero, based upon aGroup B2 classification. However, the Agency will fully consider both approachesbefore promulgation. Comment is requested on both approaches. 27. <T3>Toluene.</T3> EPA proposed an MCLG of 2.0 mg/l for toluene in the November13, 1985, notice, based on a NOAEL of 1130 mg/m\3\ from animal studies.No new data which change the conclusions presented in that notice havebecome available since its publication. EPA is, therefore, reproposingan MCLG of 2 mg/l (rounded from 2.0 mg/l) for toluene. <T3>Public comments:</T3> Five individuals or organizations commented onthe MCLG proposal for toluene. All commenters disagreed with the proposedMCLG for toluene, asserting that the available occurrence data were inadequate.One of the commenters stated that the estimated 20 percent contributionof drinking water to total toluene exposure was overly conservative andarbitrary. One commenter stated that, based on occurrence data, a 10 percentcontribution from drinking water should be assumed. Another commenter statedthat there is no data correlating toluene in drinking water with adversehuman health effects. <T3>EPA response:</T3> EPA presented a summary of the occurrence data ontoluene in the November 1985 notice. While the levels of toluene in drinkingwater are generally below the proposed MCLG, toluene was found frequentlyin the water sampled; 20 percent of the samples in the National ScreeningProgram (NSP) survey were positive for toluene. EPA believes the widespreaduse of petroleum products creates the potential for the occurrence of toluenein drinking water even though the historical occurrence is low. In addition,the 1986 Amendments to the SDWA require EPA to set an MCLG for toluene.The basis for EPA's assumption that drinking water could contribute upto 20 percent of total toluene exposure is presented in Section III-B;no actual data on toluene exposures from other sources were submitted bythe commenter. Thus, EPA believes a 20 percent contribution from drinkingwater is appropriate in the absence of specific data in accordance withthe policy described earlier in this notice. EPA solicits any such datathat may be available. 28. <T3>Toxaphene.</T3> EPA proposed an MCLG of zero for toxaphene in the November1985 proposal. This was based upon data which indicate that toxaphene isa carcinogen in animals and thus is classified in Group B2. No new relevantdata which change the conclusions presented in that notice have becomeavailable since its publication. EPA is, therefore, reproposing an MCLGof zero for toxaphene. <T3>Public comments:</T3> Two individuals or organizations commented onthe MCLG proposal for toxaphene. One commenter agreed with the proposal.The other commenter disagreed with EPA's assessment of toxaphene occurrencein water, stating that a recent survey of rural water sources contradictsthe conclusion that significant occurrences of toxaphene contaminationexist. <T3>EPA response:</T3> EPA agrees that toxaphene was not detected in theRural Water Survey and that occurrence appears to be minimal. However,EPA is required to prepare drinking water regulations for toxaphene underthe 1986 SDWA Amendments. 29. <T3>2,4,5-TP (Silvex).</T3> EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.052 mg/l for 2,4,5-TPin the November 1985 proposal. This was based upon a two-year feeding studyin dogs in which 0.75 mg/kg/day was identified as the NOAEL [Mullison.1968. South Weed Conf. Proc. 19th Annual Meeting. Jacksonville, FL, pp.420-436]. Using an uncertainty factor of 100, a DWEL of 0.26 mg/l was calculated.No new relevant data which change the conclusions presented in that noticehave become available since its publication. EPA is, therefore, reproposingan MCLG of 0.05 mg/l, rounded from the proposed value of 0.052 mg/l. <T3>Public comments:</T3> Five individuals or organizations commented onthe MCLG proposal for 2,4,5-TP. One commenter noted that the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice did not contain adequate details on theanalytical methods for detection of 2,4,5-TP in drinking water. One commenterpointed out that 2,4,5-TP is not likely to occur in drinking water sincemost uses of 2,4,5-TP were suspended in 1979, all registrations have beenvoluntarily withdrawn or cancelled, and the period for limited use of existingstocks has expired. Three commenters recommended that 2,4,5-TP not be regulatedbecause of its low occurrence. One commenter disagreed with the MCLG proposedby EPA, stating that a 20 percent drinking water contribution is not appropriatesince there is little or no likelihood of exposure from food or air. Onecommenter questioned the rationale on why NAS used an uncertainty factorof 1,000, while EPA used an uncertainty factor of 100 for the same data.<T3>EPA response:</T3> See Section IV for a discussion of the proposedanalytical method for 2,4,5-TP. EPA agrees that occurrence of 2,4,5-TPis limited, but the compound has been found in drinking water suppliesat hazardous waste sites and in waste water. Thus, EPA believes the potentialexists for some occurrence and, under the provisions of the 1986 SDWA Amendments,EPA must set a drinking water regulation for 2,4,5-TP. EPA believes that exposure data are inadequate to assess the contributionof 2,4,5-TP from the different sources (food and air) and thus believesit is appropriate to consider a 20 percent contribution from drinking water,according to the policy previously described. NAS did not provide a rationalefor their selection of an uncertainty factor of 1,000; EPA's use of anuncertainty factor of 100 was consistent with its policy on the use ofuncertainty factors based on a NOAEL from an animal study. 30. <T3>Xylenes (total).</T3> EPA proposed an MCLG of 0.44 mg/l for xylenesin the November 1985 proposal. However, since that time new data have becomeavailable which change EPA's conclusions about xylene's toxicity. Thisnotice will discuss only the new data and conclusions that have been changedsince publication of that notice, resulting in a reproposed MCLG of 10mg/l for xylenes. For the purposes of this proposal, xylenes are consideredto be the mixture of three isomers, ortho-, meta-, and para-xylenes. In the November 1985 proposal, EPA estimated a provisional DWEL for xylenesbased on an inhalation study using rats, guinea pigs, monkeys and dogs.The animals were exposed continuously for 90 days; an exposure level of337 mg/m\3\ was determined to be the NOAEL for xylenes based on this study.EPA applied an uncertainty factor of 1,000 (because few animals were usedin the study), and assumed that an adult consumes two liters of water perday; this resulted in a DWEL of 2.2 mg/l. Finally, EPA assumed that 20percent of xylenes exposure comes from drinking water; resulting in anMCLG of 0.44  mg/l. EPA also evaluated the carcinogenic potential of xylenes in the November1985 proposal. Few data were available; a carcinogenicity bioassay wasat that time being conducted by the NTP although the data were not available.Xylenes were placed in Group D, based on inadequate animal data. Since the November 1985 notice, the NTP bioassay (Toxicology and CarcinogenesisStudies of Xylenes, Technical Report No. 327, 1986) on xylenes in ratsand mice has been completed and made available. The test compound containedp-xylene (13.6 percent), m-xylene (60.2 percent), o-xylene (9.1 percent)and ethylbenzene (17 percent). At no site was the incidence of neoplasticlesions in rats or mice of both sexes found to be related to the administrationof xylenes. Xylenes are classified in Group D; EPA is presently reconsideringthis classification and may change it to Group E (based upon the reviewof the bioassay results) at a later date. Based on the NTP study, EPA is proposing a revised MCLG because this studywas conducted by the oral route. It is therefore more representative ofxylene's toxicity in drinking water than is the inhalation study whichformed the basis for the MCLG in the November 1985 notice. The NTP studyinvolved the administration of 0, 250, or 500 mg/kg xylenes in corn oilby gavage to groups of F344/N rats of each sex, 5 days per week for 103weeks. Although the mortality was dose-related in male rats (final survival:vehicle control, 36/50; low dose, 26/50; high dose, 20/50), many of theearly deaths in the dosed males were gavage related. Body weights of thehigh-dose (500 mg/kg) male rats were 5 to 8 percent lower than those ofthe vehicle controls after week 59. The mean body weights of low-dose andvehicle control male rats and those of dosed and vehicle control femalerats were comparable. Survival rates of female rats were not significantlydifferent from those of the vehicle controls. Using the 250 mg/kg dose(adjusted by 5/7 because the dose was only administered for 5 days perweek) of xylenes in rats as the NOAEL, and an uncertainty factor of 100,an RfD of 1.78 mg/kg/day has been calculated. A DWEL of 62 mg/l was calculatedfrom the RfD value of 1.78 mg/kg/day, assuming that a 70-kg adult consumes2 liters of water per day. The proposed MCLG of 10 mg/l (rounded from 12mg/l) is based on the DWEL of 62 mg/l, assuming 20 percent of total exposureto xylenes is from drinking water sources. <T3>Public comments:</T3> Four individuals or organizations commented onthe MCLG proposal for xylenes. One commenter agreed with the proposal.One commenter disagreed with the assumed 20 percent contribution of drinkingwater to total xylenes exposure, asserting that it was an over-conservativeand arbitrary figure and is inappropriate because the air concentrationof xylenes is low and it is unlikely to contaminate food. Two commentersstated that xylenes will not have a significant impact asserting that ithas only been found in drinking water following installation of floatingcovers which used adhesives in which xylenes were a solvent. <T3>EPA response:</T3> There is at present inadequate data to characterizeexposures to xylenes from food and air. In the absence of such data, EPAis assuming a 20 percent contribution from water, for the reasons outlinedpreviously. EPA agrees that xylenes have not been found to have widespread occurrencein drinking water, and thus many systems will not have to install treatmentto meet the proposed standard. However, the 1986 SDWA Amendments requirethat a regulation be set for xylenes.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.

The term, ``feasible,'' means ``feasible withthe use of the best technology, treatment techniques, and other means,which the Administrator finds, after examination for efficacy under fieldconditions and not solely under laboratory conditions, are available (takingcosts into consideration).'' SDWA section 1412(b)(5). Each national primarydrinking water regulation which establishes an MCL must list the technology,treatment techniques, and other means which the Administrator finds tobe feasible for meeting the MCL (SDWA section 1412(b)(6)). The present statutory standard for ``best available technology'' (BAT)under 1412(b)(5) represents a change from the provision prior to 1986,which required EPA to judge feasibility on the basis of ``best technologiesgenerally available'' (``BTGA''). The 1986 amendments to the SDWA changedBTGA to BAT and added the requirement that BAT must be tested for efficacyunder field conditions, not just under laboratory conditions. The legislativehistory explains that Congress removed the term, ``generally'' to assurethat MCLs ``reflect the full extent of current technology capability.''(S. Rep. No. 56, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. at 6 (1985)). Read together withthe legislative history, EPA has concluded that the statutory term, ``bestavailable technology,'' is a broader standard than ``best technology generallyavailable'' and that this standard allows EPA to select a technology thatis not necessarily in widespread use, as long as it has been field testedbeyond the laboratory. In addition, EPA believes this change in the statutoryrequirement means that the technology selected need not necessarily havebeen field tested for each specific contaminant. Rather, EPA may projectoperating conditions for a specific contaminant using a field tested technologyfrom laboratory or pilot systems data. Based on the statutory directive for setting the MCLs, EPA derives theMCLs based on an evaluation of (1) the availability and performance ofvarious technologies for removing the contaminant, and (2) the costs ofapplying those technologies. Other factors which are considered in determiningthe MCL include the ability of laboratories to measure accurately and consistentlythe level of the contaminant with available analytical methods. For carcinogensthe Agency also evaluates the health risks that are associated with variouslevels of the contaminants with the goal of ensuring that the risks atthe MCL fall within the 10^4 to 10^6 risk range that the Agency considersprotective of public health and therefore achieves the overall purposeof the SDWA. EPA's initial step in deriving the MCL is to make an engineering assessmentof technologies which are capable of removing a contaminant from drinkingwater. This assessment determines which of those technologies are ``best.''EPA reviews the available data to determine technologies which have thehighest removal efficiencies, are compatible with other water treatmentprocesses, and are not limited to a particular geographic region. A detaileddiscussion of EPA's engineering assessment of the available technologiesfor treating each contaminant and the proposed BAT(s) is contained in SectionIV-B below. Based on the removal capabilities of the various technologies, EPA calculatesthe level of each contaminant that is achievable by their application torelatively clean raw water sources. (<T3>See </T3>H.R. Rep. 1185, 93rd Cong., 2nd Sess. at 13 (1974); 132 Cong.Rec. S6287, May 21, 1986, statement of Sen. Durenberger.) When considering costs, EPA decides whether the technology is reasonablyaffordable by regional and large metropolitan public water systems. Thisstandard was established when the SDWA was enacted in 1974 (see H.R. Rep.No. 93-1185 at 18 (1974)) and reaffirmed when the Act was amended in 1986(see 132 Cong. Rec. S6287 (May 21, 1986) (statement of Sen. Durenberger)).EPA also evaluates the total national compliance costs. This evaluationconsiders the number of systems that will have to install treatment inorder to comply with the MCL. The resulting national costs vary dependingupon the concentration level chosen as the MCL. The lower the MCL, thegreater the number of systems that may have to install BAT in order toachieve compliance. EPA believes that national costs should be consideredby the Agency as part of its determination of what MCL level is ``feasible''.The feasibility of setting the MCL at a precise level is also influencedby laboratory ability to measure reliably for the contaminant. EPA derivespractical quantitation levels (PQLs) which reflect the level that can bemeasured by good laboratories under normal operating conditions withinspecified limits of precision and accuracy. (A detailed explanation ofthe PQL is contained in section IV-A, below.) Because compliance with theMCL is determined by analysis with approved analytical techniques, theability to analyze consistently and accurately for a contaminant at theMCL is important to enforce a regulatory standard. Thus, the feasibilityof meeting a particular level is affected by the ability of analyticalmethods to determine with sufficient precision and accuracy whether sucha level is actually being achieved. This factor is critically importantin determining the MCL for contaminants for which EPA proposes to set theMCLG at zero, a number which by definition cannot be measured. Limits ofanalytical detection require that the MCL be set at some level greaterthan the MCLG for these contaminants. In these cases, EPA examines thereduction capability of BAT and the accuracy of analytical techniques asreflected in the PQL to determine the appropriate MCL level.EPA also evaluates the health risks that are associated with various contaminantlevels in order to insure that the MCL adequately protects the public health.For drinking water contaminants, EPA sets a reference risk range for carcinogensat 10^4 to 10^4 excess individual risk from lifetime exposure. Most regulatoryactions in a variety of EPA programs generally target this range usingconservative models which are not likely to underestimate the risk. Sincethe underlying goal of the Safe Drinking Water Act is to protect the publicfrom adverse effects due to drinking water contaminants, EPA seeks to insurethat the health risks associated with MCLs for carcinogenic contaminantsare not significant. Below is a detailed discussion of the Agency's derivation of the proposedMCLs. <ITAG tagnum="81">A. </ITAG><T3>Analytical Methods </T3>The SDWA directs EPA to set an MCL for a contaminant ``if, in the judgmentof the Administrator, it is economically and technologically feasible toascertain the level of such contaminant in water in public water systems.''(SDWA section 1401(1)(C)(ii)). To make this threshold determination forcontaminants proposed today, EPA evaluated the availability, costs, andthe performance of analytical techniques which measure drinking water contaminants.This evaluation is discussed below. EPA also considered the ability oflaboratories to measure consistently and accurately for a contaminant (i.e.,the PQL) to determine the appropriate MCL. The reliability of analytical methods is critical at the maximum contaminantlevel. Therefore, each analytical method was evaluated for accuracy orrecovery (lack of bias) and precision (good reproducibility) at the MCLrange(s). The primary purpose of this evaluation is to determine: andbullet; Whether analytical methods exist to measure drinking water contaminants;andbullet; Reasonable expectations of technical performance by analyticallaboratories at the MCL level(s); and andbullet; Analytical costs. The selection of analytical methods considers the following factors: (a) Reliability (i.e., precision/accuracy) of the analytical results; (b) Specificity in the presence of interferences; (c) Availability of enough equipment and trained personnel to implementa national monitoring program (i.e., laboratory availability); (d) Rapidity of analysis to permit routine use; and (e) Cost of analysis to water supply systems. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Inorganic Chemicals </ITAG>Analytical methods exist to measure each inorganic contaminant coveredby today's proposed rule. Table 6 lists the analytical methods currentlyapproved for the inorganics (see 40 CFR Part 141, Subpart C). The analyticalmethods listed in Table 6 have been used for many years to determine compliancewith the current MCLs. Table 7 lists the analytical methods that EPA is proposing today to complywith the proposed monitoring requirements.

Both the American Society forTesting and Materials and ``Standard Methods'' discontinued publicationof this method. In addition to those analytical methods approved for compliance with thecurrent inorganic MCLs, a new analytical technique, ion chromatographydeveloped by the Millipore Corporation, is available. Ion chromatographyis used to analyze nitrate. It uses an ultraviolet detector and a singlecolumn. Comparability data has been gathered on both the Millipore Corporationmethod and on EPA's Method 300.0 (ion chromatography based method). Thecomparability data indicate that these two analytical techniques are comparablein terms of precision and accuracy. The study report is in the docket forthis proposed rule. Public comments are requested on whether EPA shouldapprove the Millipore analytical method for nitrate analysis. EPA is proposing MCLs for two inorganic contaminants, nitrite and asbestos,not previously regulated. EPA is proposing four analytical methods to determinenitrite using the spectrophotometric, colorimetric or ion chromatographytechniques. These methods have been available for some time and use proceduressimilar to those used for nitrate analyses. EPA also evaluated existinganalytical methods for asbestos and determined that transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) is the best available technique. However, some major drawbacksof TEM exist. They are: (1) The initial capital outlay is expensive formany laboratories (in the order of $200,000 for equipment), (2) the analyticalcost may run from $300 to $500 per sample, (3) analysis requires specializedfacilities and highly trained personnel, and (4) currently the availabilityof equipped laboratories is limited. The compliance monitoring requirementsproposed later in this rule reflect these limitations. EPA believes thatsufficient analytical capacity will exist for those water systems thatare vulnerable to asbestos contamination to conduct monitoring in the timeframe specified in the proposed rule. EPA has determined that the analytical methods listed in Table 7 are technicallyand economically available for inorganic monitoring. The analytical costsassociated with analyzing the metals (barium, cadmium, chromium, mercuryand selenium) and the inorganic anions (nitrate and nitrite) are $20 to$30 per metal per sample and $10 to $20 per nitrate/nitrite sample. EPAbelieves these analytical costs are affordable. (The actual analyticalcosts may vary with the laboratory, analytical technique selected, thetotal number of samples and other factors.) The number of laboratoriesthat routinely participate in EPA's Water Supply and Water Pollution performanceevaluation studies indicates that many laboratories having the capabilityto conduct analysis for the metals and nitrate/nitrite exist. Furthermore,EPA believes that it is economically and technologically feasible for systemsto monitor for asbestos as prescribed in the proposed rule. To ensure thatenough laboratories exist to analyze for asbestos, EPA is proposing thatpublic water systems have five years from publication of the final ruleto complete the asbestos monitoring. [See section on Compliance MonitoringRequirements.] Below is a description of the proposed techniques. For precision and accuracyinformation on the proposed analytical methods, EPA refers readers to thereferences listed in Table 7. EPA requests public comments on the technicaladequacy of the proposed analytical techniques. a. <T3>Metals</T3>_<T3>Atomic Absorption Methods</T3>_Metals in solution may be determinedby atomic absorption spectroscopy. There are two techniques that may beused: direct aspiration (AA) and the graphite furnace technique (GFAA).In direct aspiration, the sample is aspirated into a flame and atomized.A light beam is directed through the flame into a monochromator and ontoa detector that measures the amount of light absorbed by the atomized elementin the flame. Because each metal has its own characteristic absorptionwavelength, a source lamp composed of that element is used. This makesthe method relatively free from spectral or radiation interferences. Theamount of energy of the characteristic wavelength absorbed in the flameis proportional to the concentration of the element in the sample. In thefurnace technique, a sample is placed in the graphite tube in the furnace,evaporated to dryness, charred and atomized. As a greater percentage ofthe available analyte atoms are vaporized and dissociated for absorptionin the graphite tube, lower concentrations may be determined. Atomic absorption is applicable to the determination of barium, cadmium,chromium, mercury and selenium. The specific requirements for analyzingthese metals using atomic absorption techniques vary with the metal and/orthe concentration. When the direct aspiration atomic absorption techniquedoes not provide adequate sensitivity (in addition to the furnace technique),other specialized procedures are available. The determination of seleniumis achieved by conversion to its hydrides prior to aspiration into an argon-hydrogenflame. The determination of cadmium and chromium at low concentrationsrequires a chelation with ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and extractioninto methyl isobutyl-ketone prior to aspiration into an air-acetylene flame.Determination of mercury is by a cold vapor technique. <T3>Inductively-Coupled Plasma (ICP)_Atomic Emission Spectrometric Method</T3>(ICP-AES)_This method (also known as ``EPA Method 200.7'') describesa technique for the simultaneous or sequential multi-element determinationof trace elements in solution. This method applies to three metals includedin this proposal: barium, cadmium, and chromium. The method measures atomicemissions by an optical spectroscopic technique. Samples are nebulizedand the aerosol that is produced is transported to the plasma torch whereexcitation occurs. Characteristic line emission spectra are produced bya radio frequency ICP. The spectra are dispersed by a grating spectrometerand the intensities of the lines are monitored by photomultiplier tubes.The photocurrents from the photomultiplier are processed and controlledby a computer system. A background correction technique is required tocompensate for variable background contribution to determine trace elements.Background levels must be measured adjacent to analyte lines on samplesduring the analysis. The appendix to Method 200.7 entitled, ``Inductively Coupled Plasma_AtomicEmission Analysis of Drinking Water'' must be followed in processing drinkingwater supply samples prior to ICP emission spectrometric analysis. Thisappendix describes a technique for concentrating the sample prior to analysis.Method 200.7 is not sensitive enough for the analysis of cadmium samplesat the MCL level proposed in this rule unless samples containing this elementare concentrated prior to analysis. This concentration technique improvesthe sensitivity of ICP to other  elemental contaminants as well.b.<T3> Anions (Nitrate and Nitrite)</T3>_<T3>Manual Cadmium Reduction</T3>_This method is used to analyze nitriteor combined nitrite/nitrate. For combined nitrite and nitrate, the sampleis passed through a column containing granulated copper-cadmium to reducenitrate to nitrite. The nitrite is determined by diazotizing with sulfanilamideand coupling with N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride to forma highly colored azo dye which is measured spectrophotometrically. Carryingout this procedure first with, and then without, the copper-cadmium reductionstep permits the calculation of the nitrate value by subtracting the combinednitrite/nitrate measurement. <T3>Automated Cadmium Reduction</T3>_This method is similar to the manualcadmium reduction method except that the azo dye is measured colorimetricallyusing an automated procedure. <T3>Automated Hydrazine Reduction</T3>_This method is used to determinecombined nitrite/nitrate in drinking water samples. Nitrate is reducedto nitrite with hydrazine sulfate and the nitrite is determined by diazotizingwith sulfanilamide and coupling with N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochlorideto form a highly colored azo dye which is measured colorimetrically. <T3>Ion Selective Electrode</T3>_This method is used to determine nitrate.The nitrate electrode consists of an electrode body and a replaceable pretestedsensing module. The sensing module contains a liquid internal filling solutionin contact with a gelled organophilic membrane containing a nitrate ion-selectiveion exchanger. When the membrane is in contact with a nitrate solution,an electrode potential develops across the membrane. This potential, whichdepends on the level of free nitrate ion in solution, is measured againsta constant reference potential with a digital pH/mV meter or specific ionmeter. <T3>Ion Chromatography Method</T3>_This method is used to determine nitriteand nitrate. A small volume of the sample is introduced into an ion chromatograph.The separation of ions is based on their relative affinities for a lowcapacity, strongly basic anion exchanger (guard and separator column).The separated anions are then directed onto a strongly acidic cation exchanger(suppressor column) where they are converted to their highly conductiveacid form. Detection of ionic species is carried out by monitoring theelectrical conductivity in a micro cell. The separated species are identifiedon the basis of retention times as compared to standards. Quantitationis by measurement of peak area or peak height. The response given by anion is a function of its ionic conductivity and identification is a functionof its order of elution from the column.Another ion chromatographic method for determining nitrite and nitratein drinking water was recently developed by the Millipore Corporation.Instead of a conductivity detector and dual columns used in the EPA method(one of which acts as a suppressor column), this method uses an ultravioletdetector and a single column (with electronic suppression). Precision andaccuracy data from a single laboratory were gathered for nitrate. Ninereplicates of a drinking water sample containing 10 mg/l of nitrate wereanalyzed. The accuracy measured by the percent recovery was 101 percentand the precision measured by the relative standard deviation was 2 percent.Millipore Corporation data for the single column method was analyzed andcompared to the approved EPA Method 300.0. For five samples data were providedfor the EPA Method 300.0 and the proposed single column method. Statisticaldata analysis which compared the precision and accuracy of both methodsindicated that for four of the five samples no statistically significantdifferences in precision existed. For the remaining sample, the Milliporemethod was significantly more precise than the EPA Method 300.0. Thoughthere were some statistical differences in recoveries between the MilliporeCorporation and EPA Method 300.0 methods, for four of five drinking watersamples, the differences were extremely small compared with the nitrateconcentrations tested. The recovery data from the remaining sample showedno statistical difference between the two methods.<T3>Spectrophotometric</T3>_This method is used to determine nitrite. Thenitrite is analyzed by diazotizing with sulfanilamide. The diazonium compoundthus formed is coupled with N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochlorideto produce a reddish-purple colored azo dye which is measured in a spectrophotometerat 540 nm. c.<T3> Asbestos</T3>_<T3>Transmission Electron Microscopy</T3>_This method is used to determinethe number of asbestos fibers per liter, fiber size (length and width),size distribution and the total mass. This method also distinguishes betweenchrysotile and amphibole asbestos. In this method, a variable known volumeof water sample is filtered through a 0.1 micrometer filter to trap asbestosfibers and the filter is then carbon coated. A small portion of the carboncoated filter with deposited fibers is placed on an electron microscopegrid and the filter material is removed by gentle solution in organic solvent.The material remaining on the electron microscope grid is examined in atransmission electron microscope (TEM). The asbestos fibers are identifiedby their morphology and electron diffraction patterns and their lengthsand widths measured. The elemental composition is determined by energydispersive x-ray analysis. This technique is very useful in the verificationof asbestos fibers since it quickly distinguishes between asbestos andnon-asbestos fibers. The concentration in million fibers per liter (MFL)is calculated by counting the fibers, calculating the amount of filteredwater, and determining the ratio of the total filtered area to the samplefilter area. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Synthetic Organic Chemicals </ITAG>Numerous analytical techniques exist to determine volatile synthetic organicchemicals (VOCs) and other synthetic organic chemicals such as pesticidesand polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). These methods generally involve theuse of a gas chromatograph (GC) or a high pressure liquid chromatograph(HPLC) with either conventional detectors or a mass spectrometer. a.<T3> Volatile Organic Chemicals (VOCs).</T3> Five analytical methods forVOC analyses exist. EPA believes these methods are economically and technologicallyfeasible for determining compliance with one or more of the proposed VOCMCLs. The five methods are specified below: (1) U.S. EPA Method 502.1, ``Volatile Halogenated Organic Compounds inWater by Purge and Trap Gas Chromatography'' (2) U.S. EPA Method 502.2, ``Volatile Organic Compounds in Water by Purgeand Trap Capillary Gas Chromatography with Photoionization and ElectrolyticConductivity Detectors in Series''(3) U.S. EPA Method 503.1, ``Volatile Aromatic and Unsaturated OrganicCompounds in Water by Purge and Trap Gas Chromatography'' (4) U.S. EPA Method 524.1, ``Volatile Organic Compounds in Water by Purgeand Trap Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry'' (5) U.S. EPA Method 524.2, ``Volatile Organic Compounds in Water by Purgeand Trap Capillary Column Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry'' These five methods were approved for the analysis of the eight regulatedVOCs and unregulated VOCs promulgated in July, 1987 (see 52 FR 25714, July8, 1987). The VOCs in this proposed rule (cis-1,2-dichloroethylene, 1,2-dichloropropane,monochlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, styrene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene,trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) were included inthe monitoring requirements for unregulated VOCs in the 1987 rule. EPArefers readers to that rule for specific information on laboratory availability,method specificity in the presence of interferences, rapidity, and analyticalcosts. EPA believes that the analytical methods listed above are technicallyand economically available for routine use. The incremental analyticalcosts to analyze the proposed VOCs will be minimal since systems are alreadyrequired to monitor for the original eight VOCs by using the same analyticaltechniques.Each of the five methods require headspace-free water samples. The volatilesfrom these samples are stripped by an inert gas that flows into a trappingcolumn where they are adsorbed. The compounds are thermally desorbed fromthe column and backflushed onto the head of a GC column. This is followedby the separation of constituents in the GC column and measurement witha specific detection system. Method 502.1 recommends the use of a column containing 1% SP-1000 on Carbopack-Bfor the separation of constituents that are deteted with a halide specificdetector (HSD). Either an electrolytic conductivity detector (ElCD) ora microcoulometric detector are recommended for separation. This methodmay be used to determine halogenated VOCs. The single laboratory accuracyand precision were determined by analyzing replicate samples of finisheddrinking water and raw source water spiked at levels of 0.2 or 0.4 andCx.18;g/l.The accuracy, expressed as average percent recoveries, ranged from 85 to110 percent and the precision, expressed as percent relative standard deviations,ranged from 3.5 to 20 percent. Method 502.2 also recommends the use of a VOCOL wide-bore capillary columnto separate constituents. These constituents are detected with a photoionizationdetector and a halide specific detector in series. Precision and accuracyof this method is similar to Methods 502.1 and 503.1. The single laboratoryaccuracy and precision were determined by analyzing reagent water spikedat 10 andCx.18;g/l. The results using the photoionization detector show theaccuracy expressed as average recoveries ranged from 93 to 109 percent,and the precision expressed as relative standard deviations ranged from0.8 to 9.5 percent. Using the Hall electrolytic conductivity detector,average recoveries ranged from 86 to 109 percent and relative standarddeviations ranged from 1.5 to 8.3 percent. Method 503.1 recommends using a column containing 5 percent SP-1200+1.79%Bentone 34 on Supelcoport to separate constituents which are then analyzedwith a photoionization detector (PID). This method may be used to analyzearomatic and unsaturated VOCs. The single laboratory accuracy and precisionwere determined by analyzing replicate samples of finished drinking waterand raw source waters spiked at levels of 0.4 or 0.5 andCx.18;g/l. The accuracy,expressed as average percent recoveries, ranged from 74 to 100 percentand the precision expressed as percent relative standard deviations rangedfrom 2.8 to 16.8 percent. Method 524.1 recommends the use of a column containing one percent SP-1000on Carbopack B to separate constituents detected with a mass spectrometer.VOCs are identified by comparing their mass spectra to the spectra of standardsanalyzed under identical conditions. Each VOC in this proposed rule canbe analyzed using this method. The single laboratory accuracy and precisionwere determined for various VOCs by analyzing replicate samples of reagentwater spiked at levels of 1 to 5 andCx.18;g/l. The accuracy expressed asaverage percent recovery ranged from 90 to 113 percent and the precisionexpressed as percent relative standard deviations ranged from 3.4 to 18.2percent. Method 524.2 recommends the use of either a VOCOL wide-bore or a narrow-borecapillary column to separate constituents. These constituents are detectedwith a mass spectrometer. Precision and accuracy of this method is similarto Method 524.1. The single laboratory accuracy and precision were determinedfor various VOCs by analyzing replicate samples of reagent water spikedat levels from 0.1 to 10 andCx.18;g/l. The accuracy expressed as averagepercent recovery ranged from 83 to 109 percent and the precision expressedas relative standard deviations ranged from 3.9 to 19.9 percent. b.<T3> Pesticides.</T3> The EPA developed six analytical methods for pesticides.Two of the methods can be used to screen for the presence of polychlorinatedbiphenyls (PCBs). (See also the discussion of PCBs analysis below.) EPAproposes using these methods, as listed below, to analyze for pesticidesand to screen for PCBs.(1) U.S. EPA Method 504, ``1,2-Dibromoethane (EDB) and 1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane(DBCP) in Water by Microextraction and Gas Chromatography'', 1986. ContaminantsAnalyzed: Dibromochloropropane, Ethylene Dibromide. (2) U.S. EPA Method 505, ``Analysis of Organohalide Pesticides and Aroclorsin Drinking Water by Microextraction and Gas Chromatography'', 1986. ContaminantsAnalyzed: Alachlor, Atrazine, Chlordane, Heptachlor, Heptachlor Epoxide,Lindane, Methoxychlor, and Toxaphene. (3) U.S. EPA Method 507, ``Determination of Nitrogen- and Phosphorus-ContainingPesticides in Ground Water by Gas Chromatography with a Nitrogen-PhosphorusDetector'', 1987. Contaminants Analyzed: Alachlor and Atrazine. (4) U.S. EPA Method 508, ``Determination of Chlorinated Pesticides in GroundWater by Gas Chromatography with an Electron Capture Detector'', 1987.Contaminants Analyzed: Chlordane, Heptachlor, Heptachlor Epoxide, Lindane,and Methoxychlor. (5) U.S. EPA Method 515.1, ``Determination of Chlorinated Acids in GroundWater by Gas Chromatography with an Electron Capture Detector,'' 1987.Contaminants Analyzed: 2,4-D, 2,4,5-TP (Silvex), entachlorophenol. (6) U.S. EPA Method 531.1, ``Measurement of N-Methyl Carbamoyloximes andN-Methyl Carbamates in Ground Water by Direct Aqueous Injection HPLC withPost Column Derivatization,'' 1987. Contaminants Analyzed: Aldicarb, AldicarbSulfoxide, Aldicarb Sulfone, Carbofuran. The sampling procedures for SOCs are specified in each method. Becauseof their volatility, EDB and DBCP samples are collected headspace-free.With the exception of Method 531.1, which uses direct injection of a filteredwater sample, all of the SOC methods use a solvent extraction procedureto extract the analyte(s). This may be followed by derivatization or cleanupsteps prior to chromatographic analysis. The constituents are then separatedin a chromatographic column and measured with a specific detection system.Method 504 measures volatile pesticides EDB and DBCP. Although these compoundsmay be analyzed using purge-and-trap methods, the sensitivity is improvedusing a liquid-liquid extraction and an electron capture detector. Themethod recommends the use of a narrow-bored fused silica, GC capillarycolumn for constituent separation. The single laboratory accuracy and precisionwere determined by analyzing replicate tap water samples spiked at levelsfrom 0.030 ug/l to 50 ug/l. The results show accuracy, expressed as percentaverage recoveries, ranged from 90 to 114 percent, and precision, expressedas percent relative standard deviation, ranged from 4.7 to 11.8 percentfor these compounds. Method 505 measures alachlor, atrazine, chlordane, heptachlor, heptachlorepoxide, lindane, methoxychlor, toxaphene and screens for PCBs. This methoduses the same liquid-liquid extraction procedure as Method 504. Similarly,separation, identification, and measurement are by capillary column GCwith an electron capture detector. The single laboratory accuracy and precisionwas determined by analysis of replicate samples of reagent, ground, andtap water matrices spiked generally at low ug/l to submicrogram/l levels.With the exception of the very low levels for heptachlor, accuracy generallyranged from about 80 to 120 percent and precision generally ranged fromabout 3 to 20 percent for the method analytes. Method 507 measures certain nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing pesticides,including alachlor and atrazine. Method 508 measures chlordane, heptachlor,heptachlor epoxide, lindane and methoxychlor. The methods are identical,except for the detection system. Both methods use a liquid-liquid extractionprocedure, separation with a fused silica GC capillary column. For Method507 detection is by nitrogen-phosphorus (NPD); for Method 508 detectionis by electron capture detector. Method 507 reported a 119 percent recoveryand 10 percent relative standard deviation for alachlor. Method 508 recoveriesranged from 67 to 120 percent and relative standard deviations ranged from3 to 18 percent for the five proposed analytes. Since Methods 507 and 508 were developed to analyze a large number of pesticides,States or utilities that want to monitor for more pesticides than are coveredin Method 505 may want to use these methods. Otherwise, Method 505 is preferableto Methods 507 and 508 because it covers the same analytes and it is cheaperand easier to use. Method 515.1 measures 2,4-D, 2,4,5-TP (Silvex) and pentachlorophenol (aswell as other chlorinated acid herbicides). This method uses liquid-liquidextraction with ether and either a packed column or capillary column forconstituent separation. These constituents are then measured with an electroncapture detector. The single laboratory acccuracy and precision was determinedby analyzing replicate samples of reagent water and/or drinking water.The results indicated average recoveries ranged from 63 percent to 88 percentand relative standard deviations ranged from 4 percent to 13 percent forthe three pesticides. Method 515.1 is similar to Method 515 and measuresthe same contaminants. However, Method 515.1 includes a clean-up procedureand uses only capillary columns for the separation of the constituents.Method 531.1 measures aldicarb, aldicarb sulfoxide, aldicarb sulfone, andcarbofuran. Unlike the other methods described above, this is a high pressureliquid chromatography (HPLC) method instead of a GC method. The water sampleis filtered and a 400 ul aliquot is injected into a reverse phase HPLCcolumn which separates the components. After elution from the column, theanalytes are hydrolyzed and reacted with o-phthalaldehyde to form a highlyfluorescent compound. This compound is then detected with a fluorescencedetector. Single laboratory precision and accuracy was determined in reagentwater using spikes of 2 to 3 ug/l. The recoveries ranged from 88 to 112percent and the relative standard deviations ranged from 6 to 21 percent.The analytical methods described above for analyzing the pesticides listedin this proposal were developed recently. However, most of these methodsuse gas chromatography (GC) instrumentation which is available in mostanalytical laboratories. Methods 531 and 531.1 utilize high pressure liquidchromatography (HPLC). This instrumentation is not as widely availableas GC, but it is common in many of the larger analytical laboratories.The analytical costs of the GC and HPLC methods are estimated at $200 orless per sample analyzed. All available methods require second column confirmation of any positives.Although there are no GC/MS methods presently available, EPA is investigatingGC/MS methods for those analytes which use gas chromatography. EPA willevaluate GC/MS methods for compliance monitoring as they become available.c.<T3> Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs).</T3> Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)are a class of compounds which have widely varying physical and chemicalproperties. These compounds have very low solubility in water and tendto be adsorbed to suspended matter in natural water. The tendency for adsorptionincreases with the degree of chlorination and with the organic contentof the adsorbent. The persistency of PCBs in the environment increaseswith the degree of chlorination.Aroclors are technical mixtures of a number of individual PCBs made bythe partial chlorination of biphenyl. Two hundred and nine possible compoundscan result from the partial or total chlorination of biphenyl and around100 individual compounds have been detected in various Aroclor mixtures.Individual Aroclor mixtures are designated by a set of four digits. The analysis of PCBs in environmental samples is complex because of thelarge number of compounds involved. Most available PCB analytical methodsare adaptations of chlorinated pesticides procedures. The most common approachis to determine PCBs as Aroclors because of the complexity of interpretingthe raw data (chromatograms) and because of the lack of other standards.In Methods 505 and 508, PCBs can be determined as Aroclors. This procedureis at best approximate when the sample resembles one of the Aroclor standards.The identification of PCBs, measured as Aroclors, in finished drinkingwater is particularly difficult because the treatment processes (e.g.,coagulation, sedimentation) remove specific PCBs at different rates andthe sample is not likely to match any of the Aroclor standards. Hence quantitationin drinking water samples using Methods 505 and 508 is not realistic. However,because these methods are quite sensitive, they can be used as a qualitativescreen for PCBs.EPA has investigated other approaches to determine PCBs in drinking waterthat do not involve Aroclor pattern recognition. One approach is basedon the exhaustive chlorination (i.e., perchlorination) of the biphenylring of the PCB compounds to form decachlorobiphenyl. Perchlorination methodshave been studied for many years because it is relatively simple to determineone component, decachlorobiphenyl, instead of a complex mixture. In general,these perchlorination methods have been used for screening samples forPCBs, but not for quantitative purposes because the precision of this techniquehas been poor. Recently, EPA adapted a procedure that appears to provide very good precisionat the concentration level of concern (i.e., 0.0005 mg/l). Method 508A,``Total Polychlorinated Biphenyls by Perchlorination/Gas Chromatography,''extracts a one-liter sample followed by conversion of PCBs to decachlorobiphenyl.Antimony pentachloride is used in the perchlorination step. A capillarycolumn and an electron-capture detector are used in the gas chromatographicmeasurement. This method is relatively simple and sensitive. Recoveriesin tap water spiked at 0.0005 mg/l each of biphenyl and six Aroclors averaged110 percent with a relative standard deviation of 8 percent. A problemwith this procedure is that biphenyl and other non-PCB contaminants mayproduce false positives.EPA is proposing the following approach to analyze PCBs. Methods 505 or508 will be used to screen samples for PCBs. Methods 505 and 508 utilizingcapillary columns can separate PCB isomers from other contaminants. Thesemethods can detect environmentally degraded PCBs with some certainty. Sampleswith detectable PCBs (that is peaks within retention time windows for PCBisomers) must be reanalyzed using Method 508A to quantitate PCBs. EPA believes that the problem of quantitation using Methods 505 and 508and the problem of interferences with Method 508A are addressed by usingthe three methods in tandem as described above. The procedure EPA has proposedminimizes the false positive problem because most samples with interferingsubstances will be screened out using Methods 505 or 508. Those sampleshaving PCBs present can be quantified using method 508A. EPA believes thatit is reasonable and conservative to determine compliance based upon thequantitative result of Method 508A. EPA requests comments on the protocolto screen and quantitate PCBs. EPA is proposing the use of the three methods, as listed below, for thecompliance monitoring requirement for PCBs.(1) U.S. EPA Method 505, ``Analysis of Organohalide Pesticides and Aroclorsin Drinking Water by Microextraction and Gas Chromatography,'' 1986. (2) Method 508, ``Determination of Chlorinated Pesticides in Ground Waterby Gas Chromatography with an Electron Capture Detector,'' 1987. (3) Method 508A, ``Total Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) by Perchlorination/GasChromatography.'' Method 508A is used to quantitate PCBs (as decachlorobiphenyl).Public comments are requested on the proposed approach to measure PCBsin drinking water and on the proposed analytical methods. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Method Detection Limits and Practical Quantitation Levels </ITAG>Generally, EPA defines the method detection limit (MDL) as the minimumconcentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99percent confidence that the true value is greater than zero. The practicalquantitation level (PQL) is the lowest concentration that can be reliablymeasured within specified limits of precision and accuracy during routinelaboratory operating conditions. Differences between the MDLs and PQLsare expected, and the PQL is generally about five to ten times the MDLfor relatively clean matrices such as finished drinking water. (See 52FR 25699 (July 8, 1987) and 50 FR 46906 (November 13, 1985) for a detaileddiscussion on MDLs and PQLs.) The PQL is determined through interlaboratory studies, such as performanceevaluation (PE) studies. However, if data are not available from interlaboratorystudies, the PQLs are estimated by setting the PQL at a higher concentrationthan the MDL. In such cases, EPA believes that a PQL set at ten times theMDL achieved by good laboratories is generally a fair expectation duringroutine operation of most qualified State and commercial laboratories.The use of ``five times the MDL'' instead of ``ten times the MDL'' to setthe PQL may be recommended when other considerations suggest that the PQLshould be lower (e.g., see discussion on the PQL for vinyl chloride at52 FR 25700, July 8, 1987). As noted previously, EPA evaluates the PQL as part of its determinationof what level is as close to the MCLG as feasible. Consideration of thePQL is especially important for those contaminants for which EPA is proposingMCLGs at zero. Since the ``zero level'' cannot be measured, EPA evaluatesthe performance of available analytical techniques to ascertain which levelgreater than zero can be measured within acceptable limits of precisionand accuracy. Therefore, for the carcinogenic contaminants, the proposedMCLs are all equal to or greater than their PQLs.a. <T3>Inorganics. </T3>EPA has estimated MDLs and PQLs for the proposed analyticaltechniques. These are summarized in Tables 8 and 10. The following discussionsummarizes the derivation of the MDLs and PQLs for the IOCs. It shouldbe noted, however, that the PQLs for these contaminants are all lower thantheir MCLGs. Therefore, the PQL in these cases are not a limiting factorin deriving the proposed MCLs. Detection limits for IOCs are traditionally based on a concentration thatcorresponds to a specified instrument signal to noise ratio (i.e., peakheight to background). Most detection limits given in Table 8 are estimatedin this manner. The detection limits for Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP)using the concentration technique (the numbers in parentheses in Table8) were calculated based upon a different approach known as method detectionlimit (MDL). The MDL approach involves the determination of detection limitsusing a procedure defined in Appendix B to 40 CFR Part 136. EPA is usingthe MDL procedure outlined in Appendix B to calculate limits of detectionfor analytes in all newly developed methods. The PQLs for inorganics are determined based primarily upon the MDLs andthe results from perfornance evaluation (PE) studies. Nitrite and asbestosare exceptions. No PE data is available for these two contaminants. EPA estimates the nitrite PQL is the same as the PQL for nitrate because thesame methods are used and analyses are conducted in a similar manner. Alsothe detection limits for these two contaminants are similar (see Table8). The PQL for asbestos is estimated to be ten times the MDL or 0.1 millionfibers per liter. The PQLs for nitrite and asbestos will be verified infuture studies. The PQLs for the remaining inorganics (barium, cadmium, chromium, mercury,nitrate, and selenium) are determined using EPA and State laboratory datafrom Water Supply (WS) PE studies andplusmin;12-17. These results are consideredto be optimum since they are drawn from experienced laboratories operatingunder conditions where they knew they were being tested with standard samplesin distilled water without interferences. Actual day to day operationsin a wide variety of laboratories using ``real'' samples in natural waterwould be expected to produce less accurate results with wider performanceranges especially at lower concentrations. The following procedure has been used to determine the PQLs for inorganiccontaminants (except nitrite and asbestos) using the PE study data: 1. Regression equations were generated for precision and accuracy usingthe EPA and State laboratory data for each inorganic contaminant exceptnitrate. The regression equations for nitrate were generated using thedata from all laboratories because EPA and State laboratories tend to useautomated methods which produce more stringent acceptance limits. 2. The percent recovery and relative standard deviation were calculatedat the proposed MCLs using the regression equations generated from thedata for each of the inorganics. The percent recovery and relative standarddeviation were used to estimate the 95 percent confidence limits. The percentrecovery, relative standard deviation, and the 95 percent confidence limitsfor the six inorganics are summarized in Table 9.  3. EPA and State laboratory data for the six inorganics were evaluatedto determine the range as a percent of the true value. This range most closely approximates the 95 percent confidence limits estimated from theregression equations. The range of the true value is summarized in Table9. 4. The PQLs were set at a concentration where at least 75 percent of EPAand State laboratories are within the specified acceptance range. The PQLsfor the six inorganics are summarized in Table 10. The following example illustrates this procedure. The regression equationsfor chromium based on the data from WS studies andplusmin;12-17 are: X=0.996T+0.203 S=0.0635T+0.501 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where X is the mean recovery, T is the true concentration, and S isthe standard deviation. The proposed MCLG for chromium is 0.1 mg/l. Theregression equations are solved using 0.1 mg/l as the true concentration.The calculated mean recovery is divided by the true concentration and multipliedby 100 to obtain the percent recovery. The calculated standard deviationis divided by the true concentration and multiplied by 100 to obtain therelative standard deviation. The percent recovery is 100 percent and therelative standard deviation is 7 percent when the MCLG for chromium isset at 0.1 mg/l. The 95 percent confidence limits are estimated as 100andplusmin; 2(7) percent [percent recovery andplusmin; (2) (relative standarddeviation)] or 86 to 114 percent of the ``true'' value. Thus, andplusmin;15percent of the ``true'' value most closely approximated the 95 percentconfidence limits. The PQL is then determined from the WS studies andplusmin;12-17data for andplusmin; 15 percent of the ``true'' value. These data are summarizedin Table 11. The data in Table 11 demonstrate that the percentage of laboratories withinandplusmin; 15 percent of the ``true'' value remained fairly constant overthe concentration range except for the first concentration. The concentrationsin Water Supply studies andplusmin;12-17 ranged from 11 to 132 andCx.18;g/l.The data at the lowest concentration (5.10 andCx.18;g/l) was obtained fromWater Pollution study andplusmin;11. The percentage of laboratories withinandplusmin; 15 percent of the ``true'' value is considerably lower at 5.10andCx.18;g/l than at any of the  other concentrations. The lower percentageat 5.10 andCx.18;g/l is due to two factors. The first is that different laboratoriesparticipated in the Water Pollution and Water Supply studies. The secondis that laboratory performance was less accurate as the analyte concentrationdecreased. Decreasing the concentration resulted in a percentage decreaseof laboratories within andplusmin;15 percent of the ``true'' concentration.For concentrations greater than 5.10 andCx.18;g/l, the percentage of laboratorieswithin 15 percent of the ``true'' value remained fairly constant. It isgreater than 75 percent at all concentrations greater than 5.10 andCx.18;g/l.Because PQLs are set at a concentration where at least 75 percent of EPAand State laboratories are within the specified acceptance range, the PQLfor chromiun was assumed to be between 5.10 andCx.18;g/l and 11.0 andCx.18;g/l.For chromium, with an MCLG of 0.1 mg/l, the PQL was set at 0.01 mg/l. ThePQL was set at the higher end of the acceptance range so that greater precisioncan be required.

The VOCs, pesticides, and PCBs arediscussed separately below because the approach to estimate MDLs and PQLsfor each is different. The different approaches result from the type andamount of available performance data. The VOCs were included in Water Supply performance studies. In addition,other VOC performance data are also available. EPA has evaluated theseavailable data to estimate the VOC MDLs. The analytical methods for pesticides were only developed recently andconsequently were not included in the Water Supply studies. The analyticalmethod to quantitate PCBs was recently adapted to measure PCBs as decachlorobiphenyl.EPA conducted a special interlaboratory study to estimate MDLs and PQLsfor the pesticide/analytes. The following discussion summarizes the derivationof the MDLs and PQLs for the VOCs, pesticides, and PCBs. <T3>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)</T3>_A survey of seven U.S. EPA laboratoriesand EPA contract laboratories reported MDL averages ranging from 0.0002to 0.0005 mg/l for the ten proposed VOCs. The MDL range of 0.0002 to 0.0005mg/l is the result of measurements made by a few experienced laboratoriesunder non-routine and very controlled conditions. These levels are notexpected to be representative of the capabilities of a cross-section ofgood laboratories performing compliance VOC measurements on a routine basis.The PQLs for the proposed VOCs were primarily based upon the results ofMDL surveys of EPA and non-EPA laboratories and from the Water Supply performanceevaluation studies. EPA considered the PQLs to determine the proposed VOCmaximum contaminant levels. As noted previously, the PQLs are criticalto determine the MCLs for carcinogenic contaminants with MCLGs of zero.Table 12 summarizes recent Water Supply (WS) performance evaluation datafrom EPA and State laboratories (WS Study andplusmin;17 for tetrachloroethylenedata and WS Study andplusmin;18 for all other listed VOCs). The performanceevaluation studies establish acceptance limits between andplusmin;20 percentand andplusmin;40 percent of the reference ``true'' value for VOC concentrationsbetween 1 and 10 andCx.18;g/l. The data from WS Studies andplusmin;17 and 18show that approximately 74 percent of all performance samples analyzedwere within andplusmin;20 percent of the true value and about 95 percentwithin andplusmin;40 percent of the true value.

At concentrations less than 5 ug/l, 53 percent to 79 percentof the laboratories were within andplusmin;20 percent of the true value foreach VOC tested. At concentrations greater than 5 ug/l, 71 percent to 89percent of the laboratories were within andplusmin;20 percent of the truevalue for each VOC tested. If the andplusmin;40 percent acceptance limitsare used, a similar trend indicating more laboratories able to performwithin the limits exists. Because experienced laboratories operated underconditions where they knew they were being tested with standard samples,these results are considered optimum. EPA expects that the actual percentageof private commercial laboratories able to meet the specified performancelimits will likely be lower.EPA summarized the results from other non-EPA/State laboratories participatingin performance evaluation studies. Table 13 indicates that about 62 percentof the laboratories are within andplusmin;20 percent of the true value andabout 82 percent of the laboratories are within andplusmin;40 percent ofthe true value.

These PQLs are consistentwith the study results. Most laboratories appear to perform acceptablyat concentrations of 5 andCx.18;g/l or above. Although many laboratoriesare able to perform acceptably at concentrations below 5 andCx.18;g/l, thenumber of laboratories achieving acceptable performance decreases at lowerconcentrations. Consequently, laboratories may not be able to achieve performancewithin the acceptance range for all VOCs consistently. Although the laboratoryapproval requirements consider that laboratories will occasionally falloutside the acceptance limits established for individual VOC analytes,the PQLs selected for this proposal are set at a level where adequate performanceis expected for most laboratories. The VOC PQLs as calculated by EPA are approximately ten times the MDLsfor these contaminants. EPA believes that the results of these studiesand subsequent analyses confirm that PQLs can be approximated on the basisof MDLs. (See 50 FR 46906, November 13, 1985.) While the estimation approachis not ideal and it is preferable to rely on actual laboratory data, theVOCs study results indicate that PQLs of ten times the MDL are acceptableestimates. Public comments are requested on the approach used for the determinationof PQLs and the PQLs for the proposed VOCs. <T3>Pesticides and PCBs_</T3>The proposed analytical methods to determinepesticide concentrations and to screen for PCBs were developed recently.Therefore, these methods were not included in previous performance evaluationstudies. Information currently available to EPA to estimate a PQL consistsof: (1) The single laboratory calculated MDLs using the procedure describedin 40 CFR part 136, Appendix B, and (2) interlaboratory MDLs based on astudy conducted by EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory(EMSL) in Cincinnati. The interlaboratory MDL study verified the single laboratory MDLs for eighteenanalytes using four proposed methods: 504, 505, 515 and 531. These methodswere included in this study because they cover the proposed pesticides(atrazine was the only pesticide not included in the interlaboratory MDLstudy). Seven laboratories participated in this study_three EPA laboratoriesand four contract laboratories. Five laboratories used Methods 504 and505 and three laboratories used Methods 515 and 531. The limited numberof laboratories evaluating Methods 515 and 531 resulted from a lack ofequipment. The process for calculating interlaboratory MDLs (IMDLs) was as follows:MDLs were determined for each method and analytes using local finisheddrinking water. Each laboratory ``estimated'' the detection limit by determiningthe concentration value for each analyte that corresponded to an instrumentsignal to noise ratio (i.e., peak height to background). This ratio rangedfrom 2.5 to 5.0. For each method, each laboratory ran two replicate analyses,one reagent blank and one quality control (QC) sample, through the entireanalytical procedure on each of four days. The precision within each laboratorywas estimated from the eight replicates. These estimates were pooled toobtain an average within-laboratory precision estimate. The within laboratoryestimate was subsequently used to calculate the IMDL. This IMDL servesas the MDL for an average laboratory. Table 14 summarizes the single laboratory MDLs and the interlaboratoryMDLs (IMDLs) for pesticides and the single laboratory MDL using Method508A for PCBs. In most cases, the interlaboratory MDLs are similar or somewhathigher than the single laboratory MDLs. Exceptions were methoxychlor and2,4,5-TP (silvex). The IMDL for these two SOCs was approximately one-tenththe single laboratory MDL. A possible explanation is that the single laboratoryMDL for both SOCs was calculated using a sample spiked at a concentrationthat was high, relative to the detection limit. EPA has observed that ifa laboratory uses a concentration many times higher than the detectionlimit, the calculated MDL value may be deceptively high. Because performance evaluation data are not available, the PQLs for thepesticide contaminants in this proposal are estimated as ten times theinterlaboratory MDLs. (Synthetic Organic Chemicals, Methods and MonitoringDocument, 1987.) This approach to determining PQLs when data is not availableis supported by previous studies which indicate that PQLs are generallyten times the MDL. The IMDL was selected instead of the single laboratoryMDL because the IMDL provides a more realistic expectation of the detectionlimits achievable by a group of laboratories. The single laboratory MDLfor atrazine was used to determine the PQL because atrazine was not includedin the interlaboratory study. EPA expects that qualified laboratories shouldreliably analyze concentrations ten times the method detection limit concentrations.EPA will verify actual laboratory performance at the PQL level in futuremultilaboratory validations studies and performance evaluation studies.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 14.

Lower contaminantlevels are associated with greater difficulty in measurement and consequentlyless precision and accuracy of applicable analytical methods. However,EPA believes that it is appropriate to accept slightly less precision inmeasurement if the risk posed by a carcinogenic contaminant is greaterthan the 10^4 to 10^6 risk range generally considered by the Agency tobe acceptable. For EDB, a level of 0.0001 mg/l (10 times the IMDL) is associatedwith an increased cancer risk of 3andmultiply;10^4. For toxaphene, a levelof 0.001 (10 times the IMDL) is associated with an increased cancer riskof 3andmultiply;10^4. Levels of 0.00005 mg/l and 0.005 mg/l (5 times theIMDL) for EDB and toxaphene, respectively, would be associated with lowerrisks levels approximately equal to 10^4. EPA recognizes that, at theselevels, slightly less precision and accuracy will occur. However, EPA believesthat it is appropriate to accept slightly less precision in order to obtainmore stringent levels of control. The revised PQLs are consistent withthe Agency's policy of regulating carcinogens, within a risk range of 10^4to 10^6. Public comments are requested on this approach. A concentration level of 0.0005 mg/l of decachlorobiphenyl represents concentrationsof 0.0002 to 0.0004 mg/l of the intact Aroclors. Therefore, setting theMCL at 0.0005 mg/l (measured as the decachlorobiphenyl) is within the 10^4to 10^6 risk level that the Agency considers protective of public health.A precise MDL for PCBs (as decachlorobiphenyl) is difficult to calculate,as can be seen from Table 14. The PCB MDL's shown in Table 14 correspondto decachlorobiphenyl levels of 0.2 to 0.0005 mg/l. EPA believes that theMDL for the individual Aroclors determined by perchlorination may be aslow as 0.0001 mg/l. A single laboratory validation study using Method 508Awas conducted and indicated a linear response with good precision from0.00005 to 0.005 mg/l when calibration standards were run. The Agency willevaluate performance evaluation study data after this rule is proposedto provide more complete information on the MDLs for the PCBs.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,2.9 </C><T4>Table 15._PQLs for Pesticides and PCBs </T4><H1>Compound </H1><H1>PQL (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Aldicarb <D>0.005 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aldicarb Sulfone <D>0.003 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aldicarb Sulfoxide <D>0.008 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Atrazine <D>\1\ 0.001 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alachlor <D>0.002 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbofuran <D>0.007 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chlordane <D>0.002 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-D <D>0.001 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dibromochloropropane (DBCP) <D>0.0002 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethylene Dibromide (EDB) <D>0.00005 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Heptachlor <D>0.0004 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Heptachlor Epoxide <D>0.0002 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lindane <D>0.0002 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methoxychlor <D>0.001 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">PCBs (as decachlorobiphenyl) <D>\2\ 0.0005 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol <D>0.0001 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toxaphene <D>0.005 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4,5-TP (Silvex) <D>0.0002  </D><F>\1\ PQL is 10 times the MDL specified in Method 507. </F><F>\2\ EPA is estimating that the PQL for PCBs (as decachlorobiphenyl)is 0.0005 andCx.18;g/l.

Treatment Technologies, Costs and Selection of the Proposed MCLs Section 1412(b)(6) of the Act states that each national primary drinkingwater regulation which establishes an MCL shall list the technology, treatmenttechniques, and other means which the Administrator finds to be feasiblefor meeting the MCL. However, a regulation shall not require the use ofany of the technologies, treatment techniques, or other means specifiedfor the purpose of meeting an MCL. In order to fulfill the requirements of section 1412(b)(6), EPA has identifiedthe best available technologies (BAT) for each chemical listed in thisproposal. BAT is determined by identifying available technologies whichreduce contaminant concentration levels and by evaluating the costs andcommercial availability of the technologies. As noted above, technologiesare BAT based upon the following factors: high removal efficiency, generalgeographic applicability, compatibility with other water treatment processes,and the ability to achieve compliance at a reasonable cost. The criterionused in determination of whether such technologies are feasible is whetherthey are reasonably affordable by regional and large metropolitan publicwater systems (H.R. Rep. No. 93-1185, p.18 (1974)). Below is a discussion of the technologies that the Agency is proposingas BAT under Section 1412 of the SDWA for the IOCs and SOCs. The proposedBAT were determined on the basis of an evaluation of removal efficienciesof available technologies for each of the contaminants, as well as thecosts of installing BAT for large systems. The following discussion alsoindicates, for each contaminant, the proposed MCL and presents the Agency'srationale for selecting the proposed MCLs. In determining the proposedMCLs based on these technical and economic feasibility considerations,EPA also sought to ensure that the SDWA goal of providing safe drinkingwater is met. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Inorganic Chemicals </ITAG>Table 16 summarizes the treatment technologies which EPA evaluated andthose it is proposing as BAT for asbestos, barium, cadmium, chromium, mercury,nitrate, nitrite and selenium. Table 17 lists the efficiencies of removal,based on available treatment data, for each technology. Examination ofthese technologies indicates that, in general, each can reduce contaminantlevels from the maximum occurrence levels (as indicated by EPA survey data)to the level of the proposed MCLGs. Systems should note that not all technologiesmay remove contaminants at maximum influent concentrations to below theMCL. Most removal technologies have a range of removal efficiencies. Allthe BATs at the upper end of the removal efficiency range can remove contaminantsto below the MCLGs. Table 18 shows the removal efficiencies that wouldbe required of BATs based upon the maximum expected range in influent toeffluent concentrations. Influent concentrations correspond to maximumexpected levels in drinking water sources, while effluent concentrationscorrespond to the proposed MCLGs. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 16._<T4>Proposed Best Available Technologies to Remove Inorganic Contaminants</T4><H1>Inorganic Contaminant</H1><H1>Best available technologies</H1><H2>Activated alumina</H2><H2>Coagulation/filtration</H2><H2>Corrosion control</H2><H2>Direct filtration</H2><H2>Diatomite filtration</H2><H2>Granular activated carbon</H2><H2>Ion exchange</H2><H2>Lime softening</H2><H2>Reverse osmosis</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Asbestos<D/><D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D><D/><D/><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium<D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D/><D>X</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium III<D/><D>X</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium VI<D/><D>X</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>X</D><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury<D/><D>X \1\</D><D/><D/><D/><D>X</D><D/><D>X \1\</D><D>X \1\</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrate and Nitrite<D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>X</D><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium IV (Selenite)<D>X</D><D>X</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium VI (Selenate)<D>X</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>X</D><D>X</D><F>\1\ BAT only if influent mercury concentrations do not exceed 10 ug/l.Coagulation/Filtration for mercury removal includes PAC addition or post-filtrationGAC column where high organic mercury is present in source water.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 17._<T4>BAT Removal Efficiencies</T4><H1>Inorganic contaminant</H1><H1>Best available technologies</H1><H2>Activated alumina</H2><H2>Coagulation/filtration</H2><H2>Corrosion control</H2><H2>Direct filtration</H2><H2>Diatomite filtration</H2><H2>Granular activated carbon</H2><H2>Ion exchange</H2><H2>Lime softening</H2><H2>Reverse osmosis</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Asbestos<D/><D>\2\ 95</D><D>\3\ 90</D><D>\2\ 70-99</D><D>\2\ 95</D><D/><D/><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium<D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>93-98</D><D>90-95</D><D>92-98</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D/><D>80-95</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>90-99</D><D>98-99</D><D>96-98</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium III<D/><D>90-99</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>90</D><D>99</D><D>82-97</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium VI<D/><D>90-99</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>80-96</D><D/><D>82-97</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury<D/><D>\1\ 40-90</D><D/><D/><D/><D>80-100</D><D/><D>\1\ 60-80</D><D>\1\ 80</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrate and Nitrite<D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>75-99</D><D/><D>67-95</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium IV (Senenite)<D>85-95</D><D>80-85</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>45-50</D><D>75-99</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium VI (Selenate)<D>85-95</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>10</D><D>75-99</D><F>Reference: U.S. EPA Technology and Cost Documents (11).</F><F> </F><F> </F><F> </F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>18._<T4>Required Removal Efficiencies to Meet Proposed MCLGs</T4><H1>Contaminant</H1><H1>Maximum influent concentration</H1><H1>Proposed MCLG</H1><H1>Percent removal required to achieve MCLG</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Asbestos \1\ <D>10 MFL </D><D>7 MFL </D><D>30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium <D>5 mg/l </D><D>5 mg/l </D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>0.045 mg/l </D><D>0.005 mg/l </D><D>89</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>0.050 mg/l </D><D>0.1 mg/l </D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury <D>0.01 mg/l \2\ </D><D>0.002 mg/l </D><D>80</D></ITAG>  <D>0.10 mg/l </D><D>0.002 mg/l </D><D>98</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrate (as N) <D>100 mg/l </D><D>10 mg/l </D><D>90</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrite (as N) <D>10 mg/l </D><D>1 mg/l </D><D>90</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium <D>0.050 mg/l </D><D>0.05 mg/l </D><D>0</D><F>\1\ Asbestos to be regulated at 7 million fibers/liter, for fibers greaterthan 10 microns in length.</F><F>\2\ A level below maximum occurrence but applicable for the usage ofsome technologies.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Consistent with the legislative history of the SDWA, EPA generally assessesthe removal capabilities of technologies as applied to relatively cleansource waters.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">However, to evaluate the removal capabilities of the IOC technologies,EPA evaluated the maximum occurrence level for these contaminants. Table17 and 18 demonstrates that, even under the worst case assumption of themaximum occurrence levels, the proposed BATs are capable of reducing contaminantlevels to below the MCLGs. The costs for the removal of specific contaminants, (assuming the sameinfluent to effluent levels cited in Table 18) using the proposed BATsare summarized in Table 19, 20, and 21. The general assumptions used todevelop the treatment costs include: capital costs amortized over 20 yearsat a 10 percent interest rate; engineering fees; contractor overhead andprofit; late 1986 power, fuel, labor, and chemical costs. Costs may vary from those shown, depending on local circumstances. But,based on available information, these costs are representative of typicalsystem costs using BAT. Costs of treatment will be less than shown in Table19 if contaminant concentration levels encountered in the raw water arelower than those used for the calculations. For example, if contaminantlevels in the raw water is half of the maximum occurrence level then treatmentcosts could be expected to be approximately 20 to 50 percent lower thanthe cost in Table 21. However, costs of treatment will be higher if additionalsystem-specific treatment or storage requirements are needed. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,i1,s75,6,8,9,11,10</C><T4>Table </T4>19<T4>._Cost of Contaminant Removal by BAT </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">(Cents/1000 gallons, late 1986 dollars)  </ITAG><H1>Contaminant/BAT</H1><H1>Population Served </H1><H2>25-100</H2><H2>500-1000</H2><H2>1001-3300</H2><H2>3300-10,000</H2><H2>andgreater;1,000,000</H2>Asbestos <ITAG tagnum="2">Direct Filtration<D>520</D><D>89</D><D>49</D><D>30</D><D>12 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Direct Filtration, Modified<D>320</D><D>54</D><D>22</D><D>9</D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Coagulation/Filtration<D/><D>120</D><D>59</D><D>29</D><D>8  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Coag/Filtration, Modified \1\<D/><D>18</D><D>8</D><D>7</D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Diatomite Filtration \1\<D>130</D><D>29</D><D>19</D><D>18</D><D>8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">Corrosion Control </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">pH adjustment (NaOH) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">_lime addition<D>170</D><D>29</D><D>14</D><D>8</D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">_caustic soda addition<D>34</D><D>9</D><D>7</D><D>4</D><D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">Alkalinity adjustment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">_soda ash addition<D>200</D><D>38</D><D>20</D><D>11</D><D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">_sodium bicarbonate addition<D>190</D><D>38</D><D>21</D><D>13</D><D>5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Corrosion Inhibitor (ZnPO</ITAG><T2>4</T2>)<D>41</D><D>11</D><D>5</D><D>4</D><D>1 </D>Barium <ITAG tagnum="2">Ion exchange<D>230</D><D>90</D><D>63</D><D>54</D><D>26 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Lime softening<D/><D>230</D><D>130</D><D>130</D><D>61 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Reverse osmosis<D>460</D><D>290</D><D>190</D><D>160</D><D>110 </D></ITAG>Cadmium <ITAG tagnum="2">Ion exchange<D>230</D><D>88</D><D>57</D><D>52</D><D>23 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Reverse osmosis<D>460</D><D>250</D><D>190</D><D>160</D><D>110 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Coagulation/Filtration<D/><D>150</D><D>76</D><D>51</D><D>16 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Coag/Filtration, Modified \1\<D/><D>57</D><D>28</D><D>12</D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Lime softening<D/><D>220</D><D>130</D><D>130</D><D>59 </D></ITAG>Chromium <ITAG tagnum="2">Coagulation/Filtration (III andamp;

Because permits are needed to discharge brinesto surface waters, the water system should contact the wastewater treatmentplant prior to discharging brines to a sanitary sewer or the State NationalPollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) authority for dischargingdirectly to surface waters. Other possible alternatives include evaporationpond dewatering followed by land disposal, and chemical precipitation followedby nonmechanical dewatering (lagoons or drying beds) and land disposal.Sludges are generated by coagulation/filtration, direct filtration, greensand filtration, and lime softening. The most economical disposal methodfor sludges is discharge to the sanitary sewer. Again, the waste watertreatment plant should be contacted prior to discharging to a sanitarysewer. An alternative option may be nonmechanical dewatering (lagoons ordrying beds) followed by land disposal. Direct land application for limesoftening wastes is also an alternative. Mechanical methods tend to behigher in cost, though technically feasible. The selection of waste by-product disposal alternatives will be influencedby regulatory constraints and sitespecific conditions. Regulatory constraintsinclude: industrial pretreatment requirements for sanitary sewer discharges,Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) requirements for hazardouswaste disposal, and effluent limitations for the discharge of some contaminantsinto local receiving waters (ground waters and surface waters). Site-specificconditions include the availability of sewage disposal, location of disposalsites, climatic factors, cost of land, other economic factors, and otherlocal or regional factors including available manpower and infrastructurecharacteristics. The following sections discuss the BAT(s) which EPA is proposing for eachof the IOCs, as well as the Agency's rationale for deriving the proposedMCLs.a.<T3> Asbestos</T3>_(1)<T3> Technologies and Costs.</T3> The Agency has determined that coagulation/filtration,direct filtration, and diatomite filtration are capable of removing asbestos(fiber lengths greater than 10 microns) from drinking water. These technologiesfulfill the requirements of Section 1412 of the SDWA as BAT for removalof asbestos from contaminated source waters. Asbestos levels resultingfrom the deterioration of asbestos cement (A/C) pipe can be reduced byan effective corrosion control program, including stabilization, utilizingcalcium carbonate equilibrium and the addition of corrosion inhibitors.The deterioration of A/C pipe in distribution systems is principally attributableto the water quality parameters of pH and hardness which contribute tothe aggressiveness of water in relation to A/C pipe surfaces. At leastone study that examined the incidence of asbestos fiber in distributionwater concluded that A/C pipe tapping (i.e., new connections into the pipenetwork) is probably involved in causing high asbestos fiber concentrations(Millette et al., 1979). In areas where isolated and/or momentary instancesof high asbestos fiber concentrations are reported, A/C pipe tapping isa probable major cause. Where A/C pipe is in place, the procedure of tappinginto pipes may be modified such that the contaminated segment of wateradjacent to the tapping could be released, pumped, or otherwise disposedof in order to prevent deterioration of drinking water quality. Corrosioncontrol technology to prevent A/C pipe deterioration is described below.<T3>Corrosion Control:</T3> Calcium carbonate saturation by adding limeprior to entry to the distribution system is effective in preventing theloss of asbestos fibers from asbestos cement (A/C) pipe. The goal of thistype of corrosion control is to achieve a chemical balance in the treatedwater so that neither excessive deposits of calcium carbonate nor A/C pipedeterioration will occur in the distribution system. Depending upon theraw water quality, corrosion control may require adjusting the pH and alkalinity.Lime, sodium hydroxide, soda ash and sodium bicarbonate are commonly usedto adjust pH or alkalinity. Experience in actual distribution systems,field, and laboratory studies indicate that corrosion control measurescan check the deterioration of A/C pipe and maintain the levels of asbestosfibers in the drinking water below the proposed MCL. Estimated costs forstabilizing the water with lime addition range from $1.70/1,000 gallonstreated for systems serving 25 to 100 persons to $0.01/1,000 gallons treatedfor large systems (those systems serving more than 1,000,000 persons).<T3>Inhibitors.</T3> Inhibitors added to the water to control leachingof asbestos fibers from A/C pipe accomplish this function by forming aprotective film to serve as a barrier between the water and the A/C pipesurface. Zinc salts such as zinc chloride, zinc sulfate and zinc orthophosphateare suitable inhibitors to protect A/C pipe from aggressive waters. Recentdevelopments in corrosion control indicate that zinc orthophosphate maybe the most effective inhibitor since in addition to protecting A/C pipe,it can effectively prevent the corrosion of materials containing lead,copper, and cadmium. Estimated costs to use inhibitors ranges from $0.41/1,000gallons treated for small systems (serving 25 to 100 persons) to $0.01/1,000gallons treated for large systems. Where source water is contaminated by asbestos (e.g., from natural geologicerosion, industrial discharge, mineral mining process wastes, etc.), thefollowing filtration techniques are suitable for asbestos fiber removal.<T3>Coagulation/Filtration:</T3> Studies show that coagulation/ filtrationto remedy asbestos has been shown to be greater than 95 percent effective.Several large metropolitan systems remove asbestos using this technology,where turbidity reduction is also required. The construction of new coagulation/filtrationfacilities is cost effective for large systems, especially if turbidityremoval is also required. Existing coagulation/filtration treatment canbe modified to increase removal efficiencies for asbestos fibers by optimizingthe coagulant dosage, pH, and/or adding polymers. Estimated costs to removeasbestos using conventional coagulation techniques, adjusting pH, and coagulantdosages in existing facilities range from $0.18/1,000 gallons treated forsystems serving 500 to 1,000 persons to $0.01/1,000 gallons treated forlarge systems (i.e., those serving more than 1,000,000 persons). Constructionand operation of new coagulation facilities to remove asbestos from drinkingwater are estimated to cost from $1.20/1,000 gallons treated for systemsserving 500 to 1,000 persons to $0.08/1,000 gallons treated for large systems.<T3>Direct Filtration:</T3> Actual plant operations and pilot plant studiesshow that direct filtration with proper chemical treatment is suitableto remove asbestos fibers. Modification of existing filtration plants toprovide improved removal of existing turbidity and asbestos fibers is feasibleand cost effective. This treatment method is feasible and cost effectivefor both small and large systems. Experience indicates that direct filtrationremoves 70 to 99 percent of asbestos. Estimated costs to remove asbestosby modifying existing filtration facilities range from $3.20/1,000 gallonstreated for small systems to $0.01/1,000 gallons treated for large systems.Construction and operation of new direct filtration facilities resultsin costs ranging from $0.89/1,000 gallons treated for systems serving 500to 1,000 persons to $0.12/1,000 gallons treated for large systems. <T3>Diatomite Filtration:</T3> Removal of asbestos fibers by diatomitefiltration has been shown to be greater than 95 percent efficient. Diatomitefiltration is currently used in community water systems to filter relativelyclean source waters. Estimated costs for the construction and operationof a diatomite filtration facility range from $1.30/1,000 gallons treatedfor small systems to $0.08/1,000 gallons treated for systems serving morethan 1,000 persons. These costs exclude the cost of waste by-product disposalbecause they are small relative to overall costs. (2) Proposed MCL for Asbestos Each technology identified by EPA as BAT is highly efficient in removingasbestos, is currently available, is installed in public water supplies,and is compatible with other water treatment processes in use in differentregions of the U.S. Based on the cost data summarized above, EPA believesthat the costs to large systems of installing these technologies are reasonable.Furthermore, BAT can reduce asbestos from the maximum occurrence levelof 10 million fibers/liter (MFL) to the proposed MCLG of 7 MFL, a levelgreater than the PQL of 0.1 MFL. Therefore, EPA is proposing the MCL at7 MFL for fibers greater than 10 microns.b. <T3>Barium</T3>_(1) <T3>Technologies and Costs. </T3>The Agency has determined that the technologiesof ion exchange, lime softening and reverse osmosis are. BAT for bariumremoval. <T3>Ion exchange: </T3>Cation exchange to remove barium is considered BATin part because of its demonstrated ability to reduce barium concentrationlevels down to or below the proposed MCLG at reasonable costs. Sodium cationexchange resins and ion exchange equipment are readily available commercially.Sodium cation exchange is successfully used in water treatment facilitiesto remove 93 to 98 percent of barium from water. Ion exchange treatmentis feasible for all system sizes. Barium removal by ion exchange to reducethe concentration in water by 75 to 80 percent ranges from $2.30/1,000gallons for small systems to $0.26/1,000 gallons for large systems. Blendingof source and finished waters, where initial barium concentrations arelow enough to allow, significantly reduces ion exchange capital requirementsand operating costs. <T3>Reverse Osmosis: </T3>Reverse osmosis (RO) utilizes semi-permeablemembranes to remove a high percentage of almost all inorganic ions, includingbarium. Most organic matter is also removed, with the exception of manyhalogenated and low-molecular-weight compounds. This technology is consideredBAT for barium because it is effective in removing barium (and other dissolvedinorganic substances) at feasible costs. RO is used as a treatment methodto reduce contaminants other than barium. Pilot plant studies and laboratorytests indicated that RO can remove 92 to 98 percent of barium. The estimated cost of using RO to reduce barium levels in surface watersources by 75 to 80 percent ranges from $4.60/1,000 gallons in small systemsto $1.10/1,000 gallons in large systems. RO performance is adversely affected by the presence of turbidity, iron,manganese, silica, or scale producing constituents in source water. Ifpretreatment does not exist to remove these constituents, the cost to installthe pretreatment technologies (e.g. pH adjustment, filtration, or scaleprevention additives) may be considerable. In situations where high dissolved solids and/or other contaminants mayhave to be removed in addition to barium, the RO process may offer an especiallydesirable and cost effective approach. If the influent concentration ofcontaminants allows partial treatment and blending, the above costs maybe significantly lower. <T3>Lime Softening: </T3>Lime softening can achieve 90 to 95 percent removalof barium at optimum pH levels ranging between 9.2 and 11.6, as indicatedby laboratory and pilot plant studies. Lime softening is used on a fullscale basis to reduce contaminants other than barium. Estimated costs oflime softening to reduce barium concentrations in surface water sourcesby 75 to 80 percent range from $2.30/1,000 gallons for systems serving500 to 1,000 persons to $0.61/1,000 gallons for large systems. (2) <T3>Proposed MCL for Barium. </T3>All of the above barium removal technologiesdemonstrate high removal efficiencies, are currently available in all geographicregions, have been installed in public water systems, are compatible withother water treatment processes, and can achieve compliance for all thesystem's water. Based on the cost data summarized above, EPA believes thatthe costs of these technologies to large systems are reasonable. The MCLGfor barium is 5 mg/l. This concentration is equal to the maximum reportedoccurrence level for this contaminant in drinking water. EPA is proposingto set the MCL equal to the proposed MCLG (5 mg/l). This level is abovethe PQL. c. <T3>Cadmium</T3>_(1) <T3>Technologies and Costs. </T3>The Agency proposes that ion exchange,coagulation/ filtration, lime softening and reverse osmosis fulfill therequirements of the SDWA as BAT for cadmium removal.<T3>Ion Exchange: </T3>Cation exchange is BAT, in part, because it canreduce cadmium levels from maximum occurrence levels to the proposed MCLGat reasonable costs. Sodium cation exchange resins and ion exchange equipmentare readily available commercially. Field and pilot plant studies demonstratethat sodium cation exchange can remove 90 to 99 percent of cadmium. (Ionexchange treatment is effective for all system sizes.) Ion exchange toremove cadmium in small systems is $2.30/1,000 gallons and $0.23/1,000gallons for large systems. Blending significantly reduces ion exchangecapital requirements and operating costs since only a portion of the rawwater must be treated. <T3>Reverse Osmosis: </T3>RO utilizes semi-permeable membranes to removea high percentage of almost all inorganic ions, including cadmium. Mostorganic matter is also removed with the exception of some halogenated andlow-molecular-weight compounds. This technology is BAT because it is effectivein removing cadmium at feasible costs. RO is widely used on a full scalebasis to reduce other contaminants. Pilot studies demonstrate that RO canremove 96 to 98 percent of cadmium. Using RO to reduce cadmium costs $4.60/1,000gallons for small systems and $1.10/1,000 gallons for large systems. RO performance is adversely affected by turbidity, iron, manganese, silica,or scale producing constituents in source water. If pretreatment does notexist to remove these constituents, the cost to install the pretreatmenttechnologies (e.g., pH adjustment, filtration, or scale prevention additives)may be considerable. If high dissolved solids or other contaminants must be removed in additionto cadmium, RO is especially desirable and cost effective. If the influentconcentrations allow the partial treatment and subsequent blending of water,the above costs for treatment may be significantly lower. <T3>Lime Softening: </T3>Laboratory and pilot plant studies have demonstratedthat lime softening can remove 98 to 99 percent of cadmium at pH levelsranging between 8.5 and 11.5. This technology is BAT because it has beendemonstrated to be capable of reducing cadmium concentrations from maximumoccurrence levels to the proposed MCLG level. Lime softening is widelyand effectively used in water treatment plants to reduce hardness. Estimatedcosts of providing new lime softening facilities to reduce cadmium rangefrom $2.20/1,000 gallons for systems serving 500 to 1,000 persons to $0.59/1,000gallons for very large systems. <T3>Coagulation/Filtration: </T3>Laboratory and pilot plant studies showthat conventional coagulation using alum and, in some cases, ferric sulfatecoagulant, achieves 80 to 95 percent cadmium removal at pH levels of 8.0or above. Several studies referenced in EPA technology and cost documentssuggest that site-specific raw water quality indicators, such as pH, significantlyaffect removal efficiencies. Data are not available which identify optimumoperating conditions for coagulation/filtration treatment to remove cadmium.This technology is BAT because it is capable of reducing cadmium concentrationsto below the proposed MCL. Coagulation/filtration has been used on a fullscale basis to reduce other contaminants such as turbidity, particulatematter, and microbial contaminants. Estimated costs of reducing cadmiumusing coagulation/filtration range from $1.50/1,000 gallons for systemsserving 500 to 1,000 persons to $0.16/1,000 gallons for large systems.(2) <T3>Proposed MCL for Cadmium. </T3>The technologies described above arehighly efficient in removing cadmium from drinking water, are currentlyavailable, are installed in public water systems, and are compatible withother water treatment processes in different regions of the U.S. Basedon the cost data summarized above, EPA believes the costs for large systemsto install ion exchange, lime softening, coagulation/ filtration and ROtreatment are reasonable. Each of these technologies can reduce cadmiumfrom the maximum levels of occurrence of 0.045 mg/l to the proposed MCLGof 0.005 mg/l. The MCLG proposed is at a level which is greater than thePQL. Therefore, EPA is proposing the MCL for cadmium at 0.005 mg/l.d. <T3>Chromium</T3>_(1) <T3>Technologies and Costs. </T3>Ion exchange, reverse osmosis, coagulation/filtrationand lime softening fulfill the SDWA requirements as BAT to remove chromium.Successful installation of several technologies is dependent upon the valenceor oxidation state of the chromium present. Chromium is present in waterin a trivalent (Cr III) state as a cation, or in a hexavalent (Cr VI) state.<T3>Ion Exchange: </T3>The valence of the chromium ions significantly affectsthe type of ion exchange resin used for removal. Removal of Cr III requiresa cation exchange resin while removal of Cr VI requires the use of an anionexchange resin. Laboratory and field studies indicate that both resinsare effective for removing chromium from drinking water. Ion exchange softeningusing standard strong acid synthetic resin and sodium chloride as a regeneranteffectively removes Cr III with a 90 percent or greater efficiency. Pilotplant studies indicate that strong base resins are capable of removing80 to 96 percent of Cr VI. Ion exchange technology is considered BAT inpart because of its demonstrated ability to reduce chromium concentrationsto levels at or below the proposed MCLG at feasible costs. Treatment isfeasible for all system sizes. Removal costs of Cr III from surface watersby cation exchange range from $2.00/1,000 gallons for small systems to$0.13/1,000 gallons for large systems. Removal costs of Cr VI from surfacewaters by anion exchange ranges from $2.20/1,000 gallons for small systemsto $0.13/1,000 gallons for large systems. Cost effective operation of thistechnology is dependent upon the amount and proportion of chromium valencespecies present. If removing both chromium species is required, installationof a cation exchanger in series with an anion exchanger is required. Coststo operate a two-bed ion exchange system to reduce total chromium levelsfrom surface water by 50 percent ranges from $3.40/1,000 gallons for smallsystems to $0.23/1,000 gallons for large systems. <T3>Reverse Osmosis: </T3>RO utilizes semi-permeable membranes to removea high percentage of almost all inorganic ions, including chromium. Mostorganic matter is also removed, with the exception of many halogenatedand low molecular weight compounds. This technology is considered BAT becauseit has been demonstrated to be effective in removing chromium (and otherdissolved inorganic substances) at feasible costs. RO is used on a fullscale basis to reduce contaminants other than chromium. Pilot plant studiesdemonstrate that RO can remove 82 to 97 percent of chromium. Reducing chromiumin surface water sources by 50 percent (assuming pretreatment is in place)ranges from $3.40/1,000 gallons in small systems to $0.82/1,000 gallonsin large systems. RO performance is adversely affected by the presence of turbidity, iron,manganese, silica, or scale producing constituents in source water. Ifpretreatment does not exist to remove these constituents, the cost of installingpretreatment technology (e.g., pH adjustment, filtration, or scale preventionadditives) may be considerable. The RO process is especially desirable and cost effective in situationswhere high dissolved solids and other contaminants must be removed in additionto chromium. If chromium influent concentration levels allow partial treatmentand blending of the water, the above estimated costs may be significantlylower. <T3>Lime Softening: </T3>Lime softening can achieve 72 to 99 percent removalof Cr III. At pH levels of 11 to 11.5, pilot plant tests achieved 99 percentCr III removal. The same studies showed that lime softening is ineffectivein removing Cr VI to 20 andCx.18;g/l. Lime softening has been used on a fullscale basis to reduce contaminants other than chromium. Estimated limesoftening costs to reduce Cr III concentrations from surface water sourcesby 50 percent ranges from $2.20/1,000 gallons for systems serving 500 to1,000 persons to $0.55/1,000 gallons for large systems. <T3>Coagulation/Filtration: </T3>Laboratory and pilot plant studies indicatethat conventional coagulation using ferric sulfate or alum as a coagulantachieves 90 to 99 percent chromium removal. The same studies showed thatwhile ferric sulfate and alum are ineffective for removal of Cr VI, theuse of ferrous sulfate as a coagulant renoves up to 98 perceht of Cr VI.This technology is considered BAT L because it has been demonstrated tobe capable of reducing chromium concentrations to meet the proposed MCLG.Estimated costs of reducing chromium levels from surface water sourcesby 50 percent by using conventional coagulation/filtration techniques rangefrom $1.40/1,000 gallons for systems serving 500 to 1,000 persons to $0.13/1,000gallons for large systems. (2) <T3>Proposed MCL for Chromium. </T3>The technologies identified above arehighly efficient in removing Cr III and Cr VI, either singly or together;are currently available; have been installed in public water systems; arecompatible with other water treatment processes in various regions of theU.S.; and can achieve compliance for all the system's water. Based on theabove cost data, EPA believes that the large systems BAT costs to removechromium are reasonable. EPA is proposing the MCL equal to the proposedMCLG of 0.1 mg/l. This level is above the PQL.e. <T3>Mercury_</T3>(1) <T3>Technologies and Costs. </T3>Reverse osmosis, lime softening, granularactivated carbon (GAC), and coagulation/filtration, modified by the additionof powdered activated carbon (PAC) or post-filtration GAC, fulfill SDWArequirements as BAT for mercury removal. Occurrence data indicates thatmaximum concentration levels of total mercury (inorganic and organic) inU.S. waters rarely exceed 10 andCx.18;g/l. At an influent concentration levelabove 10 andCx.18;g/l only GAC sufficiently removes mercury to comply withthe proposed MCL. <T3>Granular Activated Carbon (GAC): </T3>Pilot plant and laboratory studiesindicate GAC can remove 80 to 100 percent of organic and inorganic mercury.The same studies also show that GAC adsorbs organic mercury better thanthe inorganic mercury ion. Therefore, if both organic and inorganic mercuryare present in the water, replacement of the GAC bed will be governed byinorganic mercury breakthrough. GAC is considered BAT, in part, becauseit is capable of reducing mercury influent concentrations above 10 andCx.18;g/lto effluent concentrations of 2 andCx.18;g/l. Removal efficiencies are affectedby contact time within the GAC bed and the volume of water treated. GACis also used in water treatment plants to reduce other contaminants indrinking water. Estimated costs to reduce mercury from 100 andCx.18;g/l to2 andCx.18;g/l by GAC range from $2.10/1,000 gallons treated for small systemsto $0.34/1,000 gallons treated for large systems. The following BAT technologies all reduce levels of mercury from relativelyclean source water (i.e., mercury levels in the untreated water do notexceed .01 mg/l) to achieve compliance with the proposed MCL. <T3>Reverse Osmosis: </T3>RO utilizes semi-permeable membranes to removea high percentage of almost all inorganic ions, including mercury. Mostorganic matter is also removed, with the exception of many halogenatedand low molecular weight compounds. This technology is considered BAT becauseit has been demonstrated to be effective in removing mercury (and otherdissolved inorganic substances) at feasible costs. RO is capable of removing80 percent of mercury. RO is currently used in water treatment plants toreduce contaminants other than mercury. Pilot plant studies demonstratedthe effectiveness of RO to remove mercury. Estimated costs to reduce mercuryby RO from 10 andCx.18;g/l to 2 andCx.18;g/l range from $6.20/1,000 gallonstreated in small systems to $1.50/1,000 gallons treated in large systems.RO performance is adversely affected by the presence of turbidity, iron,manganese, silica, or scale producing constituents in source water. Ifpretreatment does not already exist, the cost of installing technology(e.g., pH adjustment, filtration, or scale prevention additives) may beconsiderable.The RO process is especially desirable and cost effective in situationswhere high dissolved solids and other contaminants must be removed in additionto mercury. If mercury influent concentration levels allow partial treatmentand blending of water, the above estimated costs may be significantly lower.<T3>Lime Softening: </T3>Laboratory studies show lime softening achieves60 to 80 percent removal of inorganic mercury, provided pH levels are maintainedbetween 10.7 and 11.4. The same studies show that lime softening is ineffectivein removing organic mercury. Using this technology is limited to systemswhere reducing inorganic mercury is necessary to comply with the mercuryMCL. Estimated costs to reduce inorganic mercury in surface waters from10 andCx.18;g/l to 2 andCx.18;g/l by modifying the lime softening feed rateat existing treatment plants range from $0.43/1,000 gallons treated forsystems serving 500 to 1,000 persons to $0.01/1,000 gallons for large systems.<T3>Coagulation/Filtration: </T3>Laboratory and pilot plant studies demonstratethat conventional coagulation using ferric sulfate achieves 40 to 90 percentremoval of inorganic mercury. The use of alum coagulant achieves 30 to60 percent removal of inorganic mercury. Removal efficiencies are significantlyaffected by source water turbidity (i.e., inorganic mercury removal increaseswith turbidity removal by coagulation/filtration). Mercury removal usingboth iron and aluminum coagulants tends to be less efficient at pH rangesof 6.5 to 9.0. The same laboratory studies also found that conventional coagulation wasnot effective in removing organic mercury. However, modification of conventionalcoagulation by adding powdered activated carbon (PAC) to influent feedwater, or adding a post-filtration GAC column, can improve total mercuryremoval efficiency to over 80 percent. Estimated costs to reduce mercuryfrom surface water sources from 10 andCx.18;g/l to 2 andCx.18;g/l by modifyingcoagulation/ filtration treatment by adding PAC ranges from $0.82/1,000gallons treated for systems serving 500 to 1,000 persons to $0.34/1,000gallons treated for large systems. Estimated costs to reduce mercury fromsurface water sources from 10 andCx.18;g/l to 2 andCx.18;g/l using coagulation/filtrationwith GAC post-treatment range from $2.10/1,000 gallons treated for systemsserving 500 to 1,000 persons to $0.54/1,000 gallons treated for large systems.(2) <T3>Proposed MCL for Mercury. </T3>Each of the above treatment technologiesefficiently removes mercury, is currently available, is installed in publicwater systems, and is compatible with other water treatment processes indifferent regions of the U.S. EPA believes that the cost to large systemsto install each of the identified BATs is reasonable. All the above technologiesreduce mercury from influent concentration levels of 0.01 mg/l to the proposedMCLG of 0.002  mg/l. However, only GAC effectively reduces mercury fromconcentration levels above 0.01 mg/l to the MCLG level of 0.002 mg/l, alevel greater than the PQL. Therefore, only GAC is BAT when influent concentrationsexceed 0.01  mg/l. Therefore, EPA is proposing the MCL at 0.002 mg/l. f. <T3>Nitrate and Nitrite_</T3>(1) <T3>Technologies and Costs. </T3>Ion exchange and RO fulfill the SDWA requirementsas BAT for nitrate/nitrite removal. Both technologies have high nitrateand nitrite removal capacity, are effective in reducing nitrate and nitritemaximum occurence levels to the proposed MCLG level, and their costs arereasonable for large public water systems. Another method (though EPA is not defining it as BAT) which may be usedfor elimination of excess nitrites in source water is chemical oxidation(e.g., breakpoint chlorination) which converts nitrites to nitrates. Ifthe nitrite concentration exceeds the allowable level and the nitrate concentrationis low, then oxidation or breakpoint chlorination (though EPA is not definingit as BAT) may be more economical than RO or ion exchange, unless the nitrateconcentration after oxidation exceeds the allowable or treatable level.Since anion exchange resins and RO membranes can be sensitive to chemicaloxidants, the point of oxidant injection should be after the ion exchangeor RO unit. Approximately 5 parts of chlorine are required to oxidize 1part of nitrite. Since nitrite in source water is generally indicativeof recent sewage or animal waste contamination, breakpoint chlorinationis recommended, although oxidation is not specified as a BAT for meetingnitrate and nitrite MCLs. <T3>Ion Exchange: </T3>Nitrate and nitrite removal using anion exchangeresins as a reversible exchange medium exchanges nitrate and nitrite withchloride ions from the exchange resins. The efficiency and cost of nitrateand nitrite removal by ion exchange is significantly affected by sulfateions. Because sulfate ions are preferred over nitrate and nitrite by theion exchange medium, high sulfate source waters increase the load on theresin and result in more frequent sodium chloride regeneration. Field studiesdemonstrate that nitrate and nitrite removal using ion exchange is effectivein water containing concentrations of sulfates as high as 380 mg/l. Anion exchange has been demonstrated to remove 75 to 99 percent of influentnitrate and nitrite. The same ion exchange resins which remove nitratealso remove nitrite. However, since the resins exhibit a greater preferencefor nitrate, nitrite breakthrough occurs before the nitrate breakthrough.Therefore, if both nitrate and nitrite are present the anionic resins capacityfor nitrite governs the treatment and regeneration cycles. The costs of removing nitrate and nitrite from ground water using ion exchangetechnology ranges from $3.40/1,000 gallons treated for small systems to$0.77/1,000 gallons treated for large systems. Blending significantly reducesion exchange capital requirements and operating costs. Blending is effectiveif a portion of the water is treated by breakpoint chlorination to removenitrite while another portion is treated by ion exchange to reduce nitrate.<T3>Reverse Osmosis: </T3>RO utilizes semi-permeable membranes to removea high percentage of almost all inorganic ions, including nitrate and nitrite.Most organic matter is also removed, with the exception of many halogenatedand low molecular weight compounds. RO is capable of removing up to 95percent of nitrate and nitrite at feasible costs. RO is widely used toreduce contaminants other than nitrate and nitrite. Pilot plant studiesusing RO have demonstrated effective reduction of nitrate and nitrite.Nitrate/nitrite removal from ground water using RO ranges from $5.90/1,000gallons treated in small systems to $1.50/1,000 gallons treated in largesystems. RO performance is adversely affected by the presence of turbidity, iron,manganese, silica, or scale producing constituents in source water. Ifpretreatment does not already exist, the cost to install the technology(e.g., pH adjustment, filtration, or scale prevention additives) may beconsiderable. The RO process is especially desirable and cost effective in situationswhere high levels of dissolved solids and other contaminants must be removedin addition to nitrate/nitrite. If influent concentration levels of nitrate/nitriteallow partial treatment and blending of water, the above estimated costsmay be significantly lower. (2) <T3>Proposed MCL for Nitrate and Nitrite. </T3>Ion exchange and RO areBAT for nitrate and nitrite removal because both are effective at removingnitrate and nitrite, are currently available and have been installed inpublic water systems, and are compatible with other water treatment processesin use in different regions of the U.S. In addition, oxidation techniqueswhich convert nitrite to nitrate may be used. Based on the above cost data,EPA believes the treatment cost to a large system is reasonable. Ion exchangeand RO can reduce the nitrate/nitrite levels from influent levels of upto 100 mg/l and 10 mg/l to the MCLGs of 10 mg/l and 1  mg/l, respectively.These MCLG levels are greater than the PQL of 0.4 mg/l. Therefore, EPAis proposing the MCL for nitrate and nitrite at 10 mg/l and 1 mg/l, respectively,and a joint standard of 10 mg/l.g. <T3>Selenium_</T3>(1)<T3> Technologies and Costs. </T3>The Agency proposes that activated alumina,lime softening, coagulation/filtration, and reverse osmosis fulfill therequirements of the SDWA as BAT for selenium removal. Activated aluminaand reverse osmosis are effective in removing selenium IV (selenite) andselenium VI (selenate) from drinking water. Though lime softening and conventionalcoagulation have a limited capacity for removing selenium VI, these twotechnologies are used successfully when reduction of selenium IV is sufficientto meet the selenium MCL. <T3>Activated Alumina: </T3>The efficiency and cost of selenium removalis significantly affected by the valance state of selenium. Laboratorystudies indicate that though activated alumina has a higher capacity forremoving selenium IV than selenium VI, this technology is capable of removing85 to 95 percent of both selenium IV and VI. For small systems this technologymay not be cost effective because of special operational requirements.Activated alumina, when not used properly, leaches significant quantitiesof alumina into the finished water. Therefore, this technology is onlyrecommended where adequate surveillance and maintenance are available.Successful and cost-effective operation depends upon pH adjustment of thefeed water to an optimum range. At the optimum the selenium ion exchangeswith hydroxy ion contained in the activated alumina. A second key factorin successful and economical operation is regeneration by sodium hydroxideof the exhausted activated alumina bed to its original state. Seleniumadsorption utilizing activated alumina is considered BAT, in part, becauseit reduces selenium IV and VI concentrations levels to or below the proposedMCLG at feasible costs. Selenium IV removal from surface water sources by activated alumina rangesfrom $4.10/1,000 gallons for small systems to $0.06/1,000 gallons for largesystems. Selenium VI removal from surface water sources by activated aluminaranges from $4.10/1,000 gallons for small systems to $0.21/1,000 gallonsfor large systems. <T3>Reverse Osmosis: </T3>RO utilizes semi-permeable membranes to removea high percentage of almost all inorganic ions, including selenium. Mostorganic matter is also removed, with the exception of some halogenatedand low molecular weight compounds. This technology is considered BAT becauseit is effective for removing selenium (and other dissolved inorganic substances)at feasible costs. Reverse osmosis has been used on a full scale basisto reduce contaminants other than selenium. Pilot plant studies demonstratethat RO can remove 75 to 99 percent selenium. Costs for reducing seleniumby RO by 10 percent range from $1.50/1,000 gallons in small systems to$0.17/1,000 gallons in large systems. This technology is especially desirablewhere high dissolved solids and other contaminants must be removed in additionto selenium. <T3>Lime Softening: </T3>Lime softening achieves partial removal of seleniumIV. At a pH of 11.5, laboratory tests achieved a 45 to 50 percent removalof selenium III. Up to 10 percent of selenium VI is removed by lime softening.This technology is considered BAT because it is effective in reducing seleniumconcentration levels. Lime softening has been used on a full scale basisto reduce contaminants other than selenium from drinking water. Estimatedcosts of modifying current lime softening treatment to reduce influentselenium IV concentrations by 10 percent in a surface water source rangefrom $0.73/1,000 gallons for systems serving 500 to 1,000 persons to $0.11/1,000gallons for large systems. Coagulation/Filtration: Laboratory and pilot plant studies demonstratethat coagulation using ferric sulfate as a coagulant removes 80 to 85 percentof selenium IV. This technology is considered BAT in those situations wherereducing selenium IV is sufficient to reduce the total selenium concentration.Coagulation/filtration is used on a full scale basis to reduce contaminantsother than selenium. The estimated costs of using coagulation/ filtrationto reduce selenium IV from surface water sources by 10 percent ranges from$0.71/1,000 gallons for systems serving 500 to 1,000 persons to $0.03/1,000gallons for large systems. (2) <T3>Proposed MCL for Selenium. </T3>Each of the technologies describedabove effectively removes selenium from drinking water, is currently available,has been installed in public water systems, and is compatible with otherwater processes in use in different regions of the U.S. Because the maximumoccurrence level of 50 andCx.18;g/l equals the proposed MCLG, all systemsshould be able to meet with the MCL without treatment. If treatment isnecessary, the cost data summarized above indicate that costs to largesystems are reasonable. The MCLG is greater than the PQL. Therefore, EPAis proposing the MCL at the MCLG level of 0.05 mg/l.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Synthetic Organic Chemicals </ITAG>The following section discusses EPA's consideration of technologies toremove SOCs and the Agency's determination of proposed BATs for the SOCsin this notice. In addition, this section discusses the Agency's rationalefor the proposed MCLs. The rationale considers treatment technologies,costs, analytical method performance, and the goal of the SDWA to reducehealth risks. a. <T3>Treatment Technologies.</T3> EPA examined a number of technologiesfor their potential to remove the proposed SOCs. These technologies arediscussed in the document ``Technologies and Costs For The Removal of SyntheticOrganic Chemicals From Potable Water Supplies'' (referred to below as theSOC Tandamp;C document). A more complete description of the technologiesevaluated can be found in the November 13, 1985 <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice (50 FR No. 219, Nov. 13, 1985, p. 46902).<T3>Activated Carbon:</T3> Activated carbon is used to treat all the SOCs.The sole exception is epichlorohydrin for which no treatability informationexists. Extensive bench-scale testing either in the form of isotherm ordynamic minicolumn testing has been performed. Some pilot and several full-scaleevaluations have also been performed. Several of the full-scale evaluationsinvolved either partial replacement of media filters with carbon or powderedactivated carbon (PAC) in conjunction with coagulation/sedimentation. Extensive testing of carbon absorption indicates it is effective in removinga broad spectrum of SOCs. Therefore, it is the most feasible technologyin removing SOCs from drinking water and is considered a best availabletechnology. <T3>Aeration:</T3> Aeration has been sucessfully used to test 15 of theSOCs. These tests primarily involved pilot-scale testing of air strippingequipment. The 15 SOC compounds tested represent the more volatile SOCs,many of which are chlorinated solvents. Studies show aeration is as effectiveas GAC in removing some volatile SOCs and is therefore a best availabletechnology for certain contaminants. <T3>Reverse Osmosis:</T3> Reverse osmosis along with other membrane technologiessuch as ultrafiltration (UF) has been tested for removal of 15 SOCs fromwater. Tests were primarily bench scale, although some pilot-scale evaluationswere recently conducted. While some SOC removals were reported, especiallyfor pesticides, it was not always clear whether the removal was a resultof rejection by the membrane or adsorption onto the membrane. Some bench-scaletests indicate that adsorption of particular SOCs may occur, and that onceadsorption has occurred, desorption may be difficult. Because there is limited treatability information on RO (much of whichis bench scale) and because there is some question as to how SOC removaloccurs, RO is not considered a best available technology. Rather it shouldbe considered as an additional technology which requires further development.<T3>Oxidation:</T3> A number of oxidants are available for removing SOCsin drinking water. These include ozone, chlorine, chlorine dioxide, permanganate,hydrogen peroxide, and ultraviolet light (UV) (either by itself or in combinationwith any of the other oxidants). The ultimate end-product of complete oxidationis carbon dioxide and water, but the mechanism rarely goes to completion,as intermediate compounds formed during oxidation may be more resistantto oxidation. Currently, limited data is available on removing SOCs byoxidation. Oxidation has been used to treat 20 SOCs, primarily using bench-scale evaluations.Oxidation techniques which were evaluated include ozone, chlorine, chlorinedioxide, hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate, and ultraviolet light(either alone or in combination with some of the other oxidants). While oxidation may be effective in degrading certain SOCs (especiallythose with unsaturated bonds), EPA has considerable concern about the degradationproducts formed by the partial oxidation of some SOCs. Because there islimited treatability information on oxidation, much of which is bench scale,oxidation is not considered best available technology. Rather it shouldbe considered as an additional technology that requires further development.Ozonation has been the most widely tested oxidant because of its use inEurope since the early 1900s as a disinfectant. Currently, about 3,000facilities worldwide utilize ozone for water treatment. Approximately 40U.S. treatment plants utilize ozonation for disinfection, color destruction,taste and odor control, and THM (trihalomethane) precursor removal.Ozone is the most powerful oxidant of the group of commonly used watertreatment chemicals. The degree and rate of oxidation depends on the typeof SOC, ozone dosage, pH, carbonate alkalinity, other competing organicspresent, and contact time. In some cases, reports of good destruction ofSOCs by ozone are more correctly attributable to air stripping of the compound.Hoigne and Bader (1979) suggest that at a pH less than 9, ozone remainsin solution as O<T2>3</T2> and selectively oxidizes SOCs. At a higher pH, initiated byhydroxide ions, ozone will decompose rapidly into free radicals, highlyreactive and short-lived species, which react non-selectively with oxidizablecompounds. Fronk (1985), and others report the ability of ozone to remove aromaticcompounds and alkenes in direct proportion to ozone dosage, and the ineffectivenessof ozone for alkane removal. In general, alkenes are more reactive thanaromatics, which in turn are more reactive than alkanes. The apparent reasonis that ozone is known to react at points of unsaturation. Alkenes arestraight chain (aliphatic), unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as cis-, andtrans-1,2-dichloroethylene. The aromatics are closed rings of carbon atomscontaining double bonds, e.g., toluene and xylene, and are susceptibleto oxidation at the double bond. The alkanes, however, are aliphatic compoundswith no double bonds, such as DBCP and 1,2-dichloropropane, thus are lesssusceptible to ozone attack. With alkenes, destruction decreases with increasing halogen substitutions.A pH increase appears to enhance oxidation. Increasing the ozone dosageimproves destruction of alkenes over a wide range of pH. Destruction ofaromatics increases in proportion to ozone dose, but is not affected bya change in pH. Alkanes are removed little at low pH regardless of ozonedose, but at pH greater than 9, destruction is enhanced by increasing theozone dose as free radical reactions occur. The economic feasibility of ozonation appears to be favorable. The dosesfor oxidation are generally in the range of 6 mg/l which is three to fourtimes the normal (1.5 to 2.0 mg/l) dose for disinfection and oxidation.Ozonation has the advantage of serving a dual role of disinfection andoxidation, and this may make it an attractive technology for certain systemsdepending on raw water quality, system size, and other factors. Even thoughthere are still questions regarding reaction kinetics and by-products,it is a promising technology which may be a BAT in the future for particularcompounds or groups of compounds. EPA encourages research and welcomescomments on this technology. <T3>Powdered Activated Carbon: </T3>Powdered activated carbon (PAC) isconsidered an applicable method of applying carbon adsorption to removeSOCs. PAC can be added either through dry feed machines or as a carbonslurry. PAC is most frequently used for taste and odor control in conventionalcoagulation/filtration plants treating surface water since it requiresthe same facilities (feed equipment, mixing chambers, clarifiers, and filtration)as those plants, as well as additional sludge handling capabilities. Unlessthese facilities are already in place, PAC is generally not economicallyfeasible to treat drinking water. For the above reasons, GAC is generallythe preferred process for ground water systems. Unlike GAC adsorption, in which the carbon in the bed approaches equilibriumwith the influent SOC concentration, PAC approaches equilibrium with theeffluent SOC concentration since it is removed by a settling or filtrationprocess. With the same influent concentration therefore, PAC will havea lower adsorptive capacity than GAC. However, if an SOC enters a surfacewater source periodically, such as a pesticide or herbicide used on a seasonalbasis, PAC can be brought on-line at that time to meet the need, whereasGAC systems must generally remain on-line. Pilot- and full-scale studies of PAC effectiveness give mixed results,though most studies to date agree that PAC has applicability primarilyin locations which have physical constraints (e.g., hydraulic or space).Fewer studies on using PAC to remove organics found in ground water havebeen conducted primarily because of the need for very large doses of PACto achieve necessary organic removals. Because of the above reasons, EPAis not defining PAC as BAT at this time. <T3>Conventional Treatment: </T3>Conventional treatment (coagulation/sedimentation/filtration)was used to treat ten SOCs, six of which have been evaluated in full-scaleinstallations. The removals for most SOCs were poor, typically less thanten percent. It should be noted that influent concentrations in much ofthis testing were very low, typically less than 5 andCx.18;g/L. Since conventional treatment is of limited effectiveness in removing SOCsit is not considered best available technology. Rather it should be consideredas an additional technology of limited applicability. b. <T3>SOC Best Available Technologies. </T3>In the 1986 SDWA amendments,Congress specified in section 1412(b)(5) of the Act that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Granular activated carbon is feasible for the control of syntheticorganic chemicals, and any technology, treatment technique, or other meansfound to be the best available for the control of synthetic organic chemicalsmust be at least as effective in controlling synthetic organic chemicalsas granular activated carbon.</ITAG>EPA considered five basic treatment technologies to remove SOCs: GAC, aeration,RO, oxidation, powered activated carbon, and conventional treatment. Inthe Agency's judgement, only GAC and PTA are considered BAT for SOC removalat this time. A detailed discussion of GAC and PTA is discussed below.Polymer addition practices (PAP) is proposed as a treatment technique forcontrol of acrylamide and epichlorohydrin (see discussion in Section IV-C,below). The proposed BATs, either GAC, PTA, PAP, or a combination, foreach of the SOCs are listed in Table 23.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>23<T4>._Proposed BAT for SOCs </T4><H1>SOC</H1><H1>BAT \1\</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Acrylamide<D>PAP </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alachlor<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aldicarb<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aldicarb sulfone<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aldicarb sulfoxide<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Atrazine<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbofuran<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chlordane<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dibromochloropropane (DBCP)<D>GAC, PTA </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichloropropane<D>GAC, PTA </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">cis-1,2-Dichloroethylene<D>GAC, PTA </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene<D>GAC, PTA </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">o-Dichlorobenzene<D>GAC, PTA </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-D<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethylene dibromide (EDB)<D>GAC, PTA </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Epichlorohydrin<D>PAP </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethylbenzene<D>GAC, PTA </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Heptachlor<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Heptachlor Epoxide<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lindane<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methoxychlor<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Monochlorobenzene<D>GAC, PTA </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">PCBs<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Styrene<D>GAC, PTA </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachloroethylene<D>GAC, PTA </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene<D>GAC, PTA </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4,5-TP (Silvex)<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toxaphene<D>GAC </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylenes (o-, m-, p-)<D>GAC, PTA  </D><F>\1\ Packed Tower Aeration (PTA); Granular Activated Carbon (GAC); PolymerAddition Practices (PAP).</F><F/></ITAG></ITAG>(1) <T3>Granular Activated Carbon. </T3>The use of GAC for drinking water treatmentin the United States has been historically limited to addressing tasteand odor problems. However, following the widespread detection of SOCsin drinking water supplies, research and many pilot-scale studies evaluatingthe effectiveness of GAC indicate that GAC can remove a broad spectrumof organic chemicals from water. Although GAC is considered to be the bestavailable broad spectrum removal process, it exhibits a wide range of effectivenessin adsorbing organic compounds. In general, the strongly adsorbed compounds consist of high molecular weightpesticides and insecticides with high boiling points, low solubilities,and consequently low carbon usage rates. Alachlor, heptachlor epoxide,lindane, and 2,4,5-TP (Silvex) are examples of compounds included in thiscategory. In contrast, weakly adsorbed compounds are comprised of low molecularweight SOCs, which possess low boiling points, moderate solubilities, andtherefore high carbon usage rates. Cis- and trans-1,2-dichloroethylene,and xylene, are examples of weakly adsorbed SOCs. Moderately adsorbed SOCsare pesticides, herbicides, and volatile organics which have physical andchemical properties which lie between those of the strongly and weaklyadsorbed compounds. Aldicarb, o-dichlorobenzene, and the VOC, tetrachloroethylene,all have intermediate carbon usage rates characteristic of this classification.<T3>GAC Operating Considerations: </T3>The application of granular activatedcarbon adsorption for removing organic compounds from drinking water suppliesinvolves the following major process design considerations:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Carbon Usage Rate (CUR)_pounds of carbon per volume of water treated</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Empty Bed Contact Time (EBCT) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Pretreatment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Contactor Configuration_downflow versus upflow, pressure versus gravity,single-stage versus multi-stage or parallel versus series</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Method of GAC Regeneration_on-site versus off-site</ITAG><T3>Carbon Usage Rate:</T3> This basic design parameter, expressed as lbs/1,000gallons, indicates the pounds of carbon required per 1,000 gallons of watertreated_in this case to the level of the MCL. It indicates the rate atwhich carbon will be exhausted or replaced, thus affecting the operatingcost of the treatment system. For full-scale GAC installation, the carbonusage rate is often the decisive factor in selecting on-site carbon regenerationor replacing spent carbon with virgin carbon. It also impacts any costsassociated with carbon handling, such as storage, dewatering, losses viaattrition, and transportation. A detailed discussion of each method isprovided in the Tandamp;C document. <T3>Empty Bed Contact Time:</T3> The empty bed contact time (EBCT), thevolume of carbon divided by the hydraulic flow rate, provides an indicationof the quantity of carbon which will be on-line at any one time, and thusreflects the capital cost for the system. The EBCT is an important designparameter as it has a significant impact on the carbon usage rate for eachSOC. The carbon usage rate reflects the equilibrium capacity of GAC fora particular SOC, at a given influent concentration, if sufficient EBCTis provided. <T3>Pretreatment:</T3> GAC systems may require some kind of pretreatmentto prevent clogging of the carbon bed and to minimize the organic loadingon the carbon. Clogging of the bed may be caused by suspended solids inthe influent water or iron and manganese precipitation. Clogging is alsocaused by biological growth when the carbon bed life is long. However,systems should avoid chlorine disinfection prior to GAC adsorption becausechlorine by-products are adsorbed by the carbon and compete with the organicsfor adsorption sites. Also, if carbon regeneration is anticipated, adsorptionof these chlorine by-products could result in the formation of additionalhazardous substances during the regeneration processes. GAC systems aregenerally added to the end of a conventional treatment process which minimizesclogging. When the background organic levels in the raw water are high, carbon isused at a faster rate, necessitating more frequent regeneration (or replacement).This increases the operating cost of the system. Pretreatment can reducethe organic loading on the carbon, thereby decreasing the carbon usagerate. The need for pretreatment should, however, be justified on the basisof costs. Examples of processes which may be used for pretreatment includeconventional treatment, ozonation, and packed column aeration. <T3>Contactor Configuration:</T3> The two basic modes of contactor operationare upflow and downflow. Upflow expanded bed contactors allow suspendedsolids to pass through the bed without producing a major drop in pressure.This configuration is not generally used in water treatment processes wherethe level of suspended solids is relatively low. Downflow fixed bed contactorsoffer the simplest and most common contactor configuration for SOC removalfrom drinking water. These contactors can be operated either under pressureor by gravity. The choice of pressure or gravity is generally dependent upon the hydraulicconstraints of a given system. Pressure contactors are more suitable toground water systems because pumping of ground water is required. Gravitycontactors are generally more suitable for surface water systems if sufficienthead is available. Gravity contactors, when used, will typically be placeddownstream of surface water filtration systems. GAC contactors may be configured to operate in series or parallel. Parallelflow necessitates complete carbon replacement at SOC breakthrough; whereas,operation in series allows for utilization of the carbon in each contactoralmost until exhaustion. In series, only the carbon in the first contactoris replaced when SOC breakthrough occurs. Although GAC is used more effectivelyin series, more contactors are required to treat the same quantity of waterfor the same EBCT. <T3>GAC Regeneration:</T3> Another basic consideration in evaluating GACsystem design for SOC removal is the method of carbon regeneration. Thetwo basic approaches to regenerating the carbon are off-site disposal orregeneration and on-site regeneration. Based on information from GAC manufacturers,on-site regeneration generally does not appear to be economical for systemswhere the carbon usage rate is less than 1,000 to 2,000 pounds per day.<T3>Treatability Studies:</T3> Treatability studies were used to determinethe feasibility of GAC to remove SOCs from drinking water. These treatabilitystudies are classified as isotherm evaluations, mini column tests, pilot-scaletests, and full-scale tests. Isotherm evaluations are batch tests which yield the equilibrium or maximumSOC loading on a particular carbon at a given SOC equilibrium concentration.Isotherm data are used to develop model predictions to estimate carbonusage rates and bench-scale test design prameters. Bench scale tests usea mini column to estimate carbon usage rates under flowthrough conditions.Pilot tests are conducted with larger columns than those used in mini columntesting and require significantly greater water quantities and longer runtimes. Full-scale tests evaluate the performance of GAC in actual fieldinstallations. In addition to the treatability studies, computer modelscan predict breakthrough profiles, carbon usage rates, and bed lives usingtreatability study results.The Constant Pattern Homogeneous Surface Diffusion Model (CPHSDM) (Handet al., 1984) was utilized to predict usage rates (Miltner et al., 1987).The model predictions were based on distilled water isotherm data. However, since the background matrix has been shown to have an effect onthe adsorption equilibria and kinetics (Summers, 1988; Crittenden, 1988),predicted carbon usage rates using distilled water isotherm data were comparedwith usage rates from actual field data using the following information:<ITAG tagnum="15">_EBCT, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Influent/effluent concentration, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Temperature.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The comparison of field and distilled water indicates that stronglyadsorbable compounds are more affected by the presence of background matrixthan weakly adsorbable compounds. The ratio of field to distilled waterisotherm usage rates was calculated for each available influent/effluentcombination. Based on the results, when the distilled water carbon usagerate (CUR) was less than 0.01 lbs/1,000 gallons, it was multiplied by 30to give a corrected CUR. A multiplier of two was chosen when the distilledwater usage rate was greater than or equal to 0.01 lbs/1,000 gallons. <T3>GAC Design Criteria for Cost Model: </T3>The following assumptionswere used for design purposes:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The contactors were sized to provide an empty bed contact time (EBCT)of 7.5 minutes at the design flow, and 15 minutes based on the averageflow, except for the three largest flow categories. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Systems with a design flow of less than 1 MGD used package pressurecontactors; systems with a design flow of 1 MGD-11 MGD used pressure contactors;systems with a design flow larger than 11 MGD used concrete gravity contactors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Housing requirements assumed contactors were totally enclosed, withadditional area for pipe galleries and operating and maintenance servicearea. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Electrical energy was 25 Kwh/sq ft of building area per year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Maintenance material costs were estimated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Costs for land, raw water pumping, chlorination, bulk potable waterstorage, finished water pumping and waste disposal.</ITAG>The base capital and O andamp; M costs for carbon contactors are mainly flowdependent. However, the cost of replacing or regenerating the carbon mustbe evaluated at each site to determine its impact on the overall cost ofthe contactor. The following assumptions were used for estimating the carbon replacement/regenerationcosts:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The raw water contained only the individual SOC under consideration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Carbon usage rates were developed using model predictions for thespecific SOC in distilled water. These carbon usage rates were adjustedas follows: multiplied by 30, if the distilled water carbon usage ratewas below 0.01 lbs/1,000 gallons and multiplied by two, if the distilledwater carbon usage rate was greater or equal to 0.01 lbs/1,000 gallons.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_If the carbon demand (calculated based on carbon use rate and averageflow) was less than 1,000 lb/day, the spent carbon was replaced at breakthrough.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_On-site regeneration utilized multiple-hearth furnaces oversizedby 30 percent to account for downtime. For carbon demands greater than80,000 lb/day, two or more furnaces were used. Carbon handling losses wereassumed to be 15 percent. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Cost of GAC was $1/lb.</ITAG>In order to determine the impact of carbon replacement/regeneration onthe total cost, a relationship was developed between total production costand carbon usage rate for each flow category. It shows that as the carbonusage rate drops, the costs drop. At a CUR of about 0.1 lbs/1,000 gallons,the cost curve flattens out. The family of cost curves (one for each sizesystem) are parallel; i.e., higher costs for small systems versus lowercosts for large ones. The curves are useful in that for any given systemsize, the costs for removal of an SOC to the MCL can be determined basedon the CUR for that contaminant. SOCs with equivalent CURs will have equalremoval costs. Where the cost curve flattens out at a CUR of 0.1, removalcost for that size system will be the same for all SOCs with a CUR below0.1. Based on these observations, it is possible to provide costs for eachsize of treatment plant for SOC removal by grouping the SOCs together accordingto their carbon usage rates, and referring to the appropriate cost curve.CURs for the moderate to high percent removals (i.e., 80-90% removals)down to the MCL were calculated for each SOC, and used to derive costsfrom the curves. These costs are presented in a following section in Table27. The costs are expressed as total production costs (total capital plusoperation and maintenance) in cents per 1,000 gallons. This is equivalentto dollars per average household per year (at 3.2 people using a totalof 100,000 gallons per year).The various studies reviewed indicate that all the SOCs proposed in thenotice can be removed by GAC to levels at or below the MCLGs at reasonablecosts. As discussed previously the cost of this technology is dependent on thecarbon usage rate. Certain volatile organics and chlorinated aromaticshave relatively poor adsorbabilities, which result in higher carbon usagerates. Because of their volatile nature, these SOCs may be removed moreeconomically by packed tower aeration, which is discussed below. (2) <T3>Packed Tower Aeration. </T3>The purpose of packed tower aeration (PTA)or packed column air stripping is to optimize conditions under which SOCswill transfer out of solution in water to solution in air. According toHenry's Law, the concentration of gas dissolving in a liquid at constanttemperature and pressure is proportional to the partial pressure of thegas above the solution. If the equilibrium concentration of the gas abovethe liquid decreases, the tendency is for the gas dissolved in the liquidto transfer back to the gaseous phase. Each SOC has a relative tendency to transfer, or partition, out of solutionin water, and that tendency is quantified by a mass transfer coefficient.The mass transfer coefficient is a function of the design of the columnand the chemical. The driving force for mass transfer is a change in theequilibrium which develops a concentration gradient The mass transfer coefficient(MTC) relates the concentration gradient (driving force) with the actualquantity of material transferred from liquid to air. In packed columns,the packing material maximizes the surface area of water exposed to theair moving through the column. The air moving through the tower preventsequilibrium, and maintains the concentration gradient, forcing more gasout of solution into the air. The greater the Henry's Law Coefficient (HLC), generally the more volatilethe compound, and the less air required to remove the compound from thewater. As a rule of thumb, SOCs having HLCs less than 1 atmosphere at orabove room temperature), probably would not be effectively removed by packedtower aeration. In actual field conditions, the coefficient is approximately50 percent of the value estimated from vapor pressure and solubility dataat 20anddegrees;C. The compounds listed in Table 24 are potentially amenable to treatmentvia packed tower air stripping because of their high Henry's coefficients.The four compounds at the bottom of the list had a vapor pressure of lessthan 0.2 mm Hg, were not considered strippable, even if the Henry's coefficientswere above 1 atmosphere. When the vapor pressure of a compound is verylow, the solubility will drive the theoretical HLC up, while the strippabilitymay in fact be low. The last four compounds listed in Table 24 may be strippable,but further testing would be required. Toxaphene and PCBs are mixtureswhich contain fractions which theoretically would be amenable to aeration.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,10.1</C><T4>Table 24._SOCs Amenable to Air Stripping   </T4><H1>Compounds</H1><H1>Henry's law coefficient (atm)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">tetrachloroethylene <D>214.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">ethylbenzene <D>174.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">toluene <D>161.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">trans-1,2-dichloroethylene <D>149.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">p-xylene <D>149.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">m-xylene <D>137.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">o-xylene <D>124.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">cis-1,2-dichloroethylene <D>83.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">monochlorobenzene <D>74.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">heptachlor <D>73.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">styrene <D>62.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-dichloropropane <D>53.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">o-dichlorobenzene <D>38.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">ethylene dibromide (EDB) <D>17.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">dibromochloropropane (DBCP) <D>7.0  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">toxaphene <D>2,010.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">heptachlor epoxide <D>24.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">PCB (Aroclor 1242) <D>39.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">chlordane <D>5.4</D></ITAG></ITAG>  The design of air stripping equipment has been developed extensively inthe chemical engineering industry for handling concentrated organic solutions.The rate at which a volatile compound is removed from water by aerationdepends on the following factors: air-to-water ratio (ideally less than100); packing material height; available area for mass transfer; waterand air temperature; and the physical chemistry of the contaminant. Thefirst three factors can be controlled in the design of the air strippingunit, while the last two (temperature and chemistry) are determined bythe raw water quality.The performance of packed column aeration systems in treating specificSOCs is dependent upon the mass transfer coefficient developed for eachSOC. The MTCs can be estimated empirically from SOC physical/chemical propertiesand the physical characteristics of a particular packing material or theycan be developed by actual pilot testing. The empirical approach allowscost estimating to be done on a consistent basis since pilot- and field-scaledata often introduce a number of variables which are sometimes inconsistentbetween studies. The mass transfer coefficients developed by EPA were incorporatedinto a packed column design model to optimize the design criteria. Thedesign criteria were then used in developing costs to determine the feasibilityof PTA in removing individual SOCs from drinking water.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s75,r50</C><T4>Table </T4>25<T4>._Packed Column Design Parameters</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Ground water temperature<D>12 anddegrees;C. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Column shell construction<D>304 stainless steel. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Packing material<D>1 inch plastic saddles. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Air well<D>concrete. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Maximum column diameter<D>16 ft. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Maximum liquid loading<D>30 gpm ft \2\. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Minimum air gradient<D>50 Nm-2m-1. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Safety factor for Henry's coefficient<D>1.1. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Safety factor for K\1\<T2>1</T2>a<D>1.1. </D></ITAG></ITAG> The transfer of VOCs from water to air by packed tower aeration (PTA) technologycan pose a problem of exposure via inhalation of volatilized chemicalsstripped from the water and transferred to the air. EPA considered the risks posed by air stripping EDB and DBCP. EDB and DBCPare among the least volatile chemicals being considered using air strippingtechniques. However, they are amenable to removal from water by using PTA.They are also probable carcinogens with unit risk factors (per andCx.18;g/m\3\)of 2.1andmultiply;10^4 (EDB) and 6.7andmultiply;10^3 (DBCP). For comparison,the unit (per andCx.18;g/l) risk factors for oral ingestion is 2.0andmultiply;10^3(EDB), and 4andmultiply;10^5 (DBCP). To quantify the risk to downwind populations, EPA used a human exposuremodel (HEM) to perform a risk assessment. The HEM used data on emissionsof EDB and DBCP from seven packed tower aeration facilities. It calculatedindividual risks and excess cancers of a population (based on 1980 censusdata) living for seventy years within a 50 km radius of the facility. Themodel assumes 100 percent transfer of the contaminant in the water to theair. It also assumes the PTA plants are located approximately in the middleof town, and that, for the purpose of air dispersion modeling, the terrainwithin 50 km is flat. Because the HEM cannot factor in the risk of more than one chemical emissionin the calculation, the risk factor for EDB, which poses a higher riskwas used in the model. In order to use the EDB risk factor, the amountof all DBCP emissions was first divided by 3.2, the ratio of the DBCP andEDB risk factors, to account for the differences in carcinogenicity. Table 26 compares the risks via inhalation of airborne EDB and DBCP emissionsfrom air stripping facilities to the risks of drinking the EDB- and DBCP-contaminatedwater untreated. The maximum individual lifetime risk estimate is expressedas a probability. Thus, at 3andmultiply;10^7, the most exposed person hasa risk of developing cancer of 3 in 10 million. This number can also beexpressed by saying there would be three additional cancers if a populationof 10 million were exposed to the maximum predicted concentration of thecontaminant throughout their (70-year) lifetimes. It was apparent in the cases examined that the risk resulting from exposureto EDB or DBCP by inhalation is several orders of magnitude lower thanthat resulting from drinking the contaminated water, and that the amountof EDB or DBCP added to the air did not significantly increase risks fromairborne contaminants.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>26._<T4>Increased Risk Due to PTA Treatment</T4><H1>Location</H1><H1>Pollutant</H1><H1>Total population exposed</H1><H1>Total annual cancer incidence lifetime risk from exposure to air</H1><H1>Maximum individual lifetime risk from exposure to air</H1><H1>Maximum individual lifetime risk from exposure to water</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">A <D>DBCP </D><D>1,480,000 </D><D>0.0001 </D><D>1andmultiply;10</D>^7 <D>2andmultiply;10</D>^4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">B <D>EDB </D><D>401,000 </D><D>andless;0.0001 </D><D>3andmultiply;10</D>^7 <D>4andmultiply;10</D>^3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">C <D>EDB </D><D>437,000 </D><D>andless;0.0001 </D><D>1andmultiply;10</D>^7 <D>8andmultiply;10</D>^3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">D<T2>1</T2> <D>DBCP </D><D>658,000 </D><D>andless;0.0001 </D><D>3andmultiply;10</D>^6 <D>4andmultiply;10</D>^3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">D<T2>2</T2> <D>EDB </D><D>658,000 </D><D>andless;0.0001 </D><D>1andmultiply;10</D>^6 <D>3andmultiply;10</D>^3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">E <D>EDB </D><D>1,790,000 </D><D>0.0001 </D><D>2andmultiply;10</D>^6 <D>8andmultiply;10</D>^3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">F <D>DPCP </D><D>763,000 </D><D>andless;0.0001 </D><D>3andmultiply;10</D>^9 <D>3andmultiply;10</D>^6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">G <D>EDB </D><D>763,000 </D><D>andless;0.0001 </D><D>6andmultiply;10</D>^8 <D>3andmultiply;10</D>^4</ITAG></ITAG>EPA proposes that in addition to GAC, PTA is also BAT for the twelve volatilecontaminants listed in Table 27. PTA can remove SOC contaminants to levelsat or below the MCLG, but because of the higher costs associated with EDBand DBCP removal, (compared to the removal of the other SOCs) EPA requestscomments on whether PTA should be specified as BAT for these contaminants.Where both carbon and aeration are effective in treating an SOC (i.e.,a volatile SOC), both GAC and PTA are designated as BAT. The decision touse either technology depends on, among other things, the SOC, or combinationof SOCs, the influent concentration, and the size of the system. For PTA,costs rise with increased percent removals needed to meet the MCL. ForGAC, greater removals will only increase cost if the CUR becomes greaterthan 0.1 lb/1,000 gallons. A volatile SOC with a low CUR may be cheaperto control using GAC than PTA if it has a strong affinity for carbon (alow CUR) and the influent concentration is high (high percent removal).For volatile SOCs with a low or medium CUR, total production costs usingGAC may be lower than PTA for large systems, yet higher than PTA for smallersystems. The choice of GAC or PTA is also dependent on the design factorsof each system.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>27. <T4>GAC and Packed Column Costs to remove SOCs</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Dollars/household/year] \1\</ITAG><H1>Compound</H1><H1>Carbon usage rate</H1><H1>GAC</H1><H2>Small</H2><H2>Medium</H2><H2>Large</H2><H1>PTA</H1><H2>Small</H2><H2>Medium</H2><H2>Large</H2><H1>Percent removal \2\</H1>Volatile SOCs:<ITAG tagnum="2">cis-1,2-Dichloroethylene <D>0.544 </D><D>$650 </D><D>$52 </D><D>$14 </D><D>$110 </D><D>$8 </D><D>$5 </D><D>65 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Dibromochloropropane (DBCP) <D>.089 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>310 </D><D>51 </D><D>36 </D><D>90 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">o-Dichlorobenzene <D>.049 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>100 </D><D>7 </D><D>5 </D><D>40 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1,2-Dichloropropane <D>.134 </D><D>600 </D><D>42 </D><D>10 </D><D>180 </D><D>15 </D><D>11 </D><D>95 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Ethylbenzene <D>.093 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>93 </D><D>6 </D><D>4 </D><D>30 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Ethylene Dibromide (EDB) <D>.068 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>210 </D><D>23 </D><D>16 </D><D>90 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Monochlorobenzene <D>.123 </D><D>600 </D><D>42 </D><D>10 </D><D>140 </D><D>11 </D><D>7 </D><D>86 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Styrene <D>.167 </D><D>600 </D><D>42 </D><D>10 </D><D>160 </D><D>13 </D><D>9 </D><D>90 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Tetrachloroethylene <D>.042 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>140 </D><D>10 </D><D>7 </D><D>95 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Toluene <D>.316 </D><D>650 </D><D>52 </D><D>14 </D><D>100 </D><D>7 </D><D>5 </D><D>60 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene <D>.497 </D><D>650 </D><D>52 </D><D>14 </D><D>130 </D><D>9 </D><D>6 </D><D>86 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">Xylenes: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">m-Xylene </ITAG><D>.153 </D><D>600 </D><D>42 </D><D>10 </D><D>120 </D><D>8 </D><D>6 </D><D>76 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">o-Xylene </ITAG><D>.450 </D><D>650 </D><D>52 </D><D>14 </D><D>120 </D><D>8 </D><D>6 </D><D>76 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">p-Xylene </ITAG><D>.496 </D><D>650 </D><D>52 </D><D>14 </D><D>120 </D><D>8 </D><D>6 </D><D>76 </D>Non-Volatile SOCs:<ITAG tagnum="2">Alachlor <D>.061 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Aldicarb (sulfoxide andamp; sulfone) <D>.033 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Atrazine <D>.134 </D><D>600 </D><D>42 </D><D>10 </D><D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Carbofuran <D>.148 </D><D>600 </D><D>42 </D><D>10 </D><D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Chlordane <D>.064 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2,4-D <D>.048 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Heptachlor <D>.140 </D><D>600 </D><D>42 </D><D>10 </D><D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Heptachlor Epoxide <D>.032 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Lindane <D>.018 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Methoxychlor <D>.151 </D><D>600 </D><D>42 </D><D>10 </D><D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">PCBs <D>.021 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Pentachlorophenol <D>.024 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Toxaphene <D>.083 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2,4,5-TP (Silvex) <D>.021 </D><D>600 </D><D>39 </D><D>8 </D><D>N/A </D><F>\1\ Costs include amortized capital and annual operation and maintenance.Reference: (9).</F><F>Small systems serve 25-100 persons; medium systems serve 10,000 to 25,000persons; large systems serve greater than 1,000,000.</F><F>Cost in $/household/year.

These include: (1) The effectiveness of BAT (eitherGAC or PTA) to reduce contaminant levels from influent concentrations tothe MCLG. Since the two BATs are capable of reducing SOCs to extremelylow levels, they are not the limiting factor determining the levels whichare as close to the MCLG as feasible. (2) The feasibility (including costs)of applying BAT. EPA considered the availability of the technology andthe costs of installation and operation for large systems (serving morethan 1,000,000 people). (3) The performance of available analytical methodsas reflected in the PQL for each contaminant. In order to ensure that analyticalmeasurement of contaminants at the MCL are sufficiently precise and accurate,the MCL is set at a level which is no lower than the PQL. (4) After takinginto account the above factors, EPA then considered the risks at the MCLlevel for the EPA group A and B carcinogens to determine whether they wouldbe adequately protective of public health. EPA considers a target riskrange of 10^4 to 10^6 to be safe and protective of public health when calculatedby the conservative linear multistage model. The factors EPA used in itsanalysis are summarized in Tables 28 and 29 for the non-carcinogenic andcarcinogenic contaminants respectively.(1) <T3>Non-carcinogenic Contaminants. </T3>For the non-carcinogenic contaminantslisted in Table 28, each of the MCLs is proposed equal to their proposedMCLGs. Section 1412 of the SDWA requires EPA to set MCLs as close to theMCLGs as is feasible (taking costs into consideration). EPA believes thatit is feasible to set the MCLs at the MCLGs because: (1) The PQL for eachcontaminant is at or below the level established by the MCLG; (2) BAT canremove each contaminant to a level equal to or below the MCLG; and (3)the annual household costs to install BAT in large systems is a maximumof $14.00 per household per year and generally less than $10.00. EPA believesthat these costs are affordable for large systems. Therefore, EPA proposesthe MCLs for the non-carcinogenic contaminants equal to their MCLGs.For styrene EPA is also proposing an MCLG of 0.1 mg/l based upon a ClassC carcinogen classification. Based upon this classification the proposedMCL would also be 0.1 mg/l. EPA requests comments on the styrene classificationand the MCL of 0.1 mg/l.    <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>28._<T4>MCL Analysis for Synthetic Organic Contaminants (Non-Carcinogens)</T4><H1>SOC contaminant</H1><H1>Proposed MCLG (mg/l)</H1><H1>Proposed MCL (mg/l)</H1><H1>PQL (mg/l)</H1><H1>Annual household costs using bat \1\</H1><H2>GAC</H2><H2>PTA</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Aldicarb <D>0.01 </D><D>0.01 </D><D>0.005 </D><D>$8.00 </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aldicarb Sulfone <D>0.04 </D><D>0.04 </D><D>0.003 </D><D>8.00 </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aldicarb Sulfoxide <D>0.01 </D><D>0.01 </D><D>0.008 </D><D>8.00 </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Atrazine <D>0.003 </D><D>0.003 </D><D>0.001 </D><D>10.00 </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbofuran <D>0.04 </D><D>0.04 </D><D>0.007 </D><D>10.00 </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">o-Dichlorobenzene <D>0.6 </D><D>0.6 </D><D>0.005 </D><D>8.00 </D><D>$5.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">cis-1,2-Dichloroethylene <D>0.07 </D><D>0.07 </D><D>0.005 </D><D>14.00 </D><D>5.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene <D>0.1 </D><D>0.1 </D><D>0.005 </D><D>14.00 </D><D>6.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-D <D>0.07 </D><D>0.07 </D><D>0.005 </D><D>8.00 </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethylbenzene <D>0.7 </D><D>0.7 </D><D>0.005 </D><D>8.00 </D><D>4.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lindane <D>0.0002 </D><D>0.0002 </D><D>0.0002 </D><D>8.00 </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methoxychlor <D>0.4 </D><D>0.4 </D><D>0.01 </D><D>10.00 </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Monochlorobenzene <D>0.1 </D><D>0.1 </D><D>0.005 </D><D>10.00 </D><D>7.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol <D>0.2 </D><D>0.2 </D><D>0.0001 </D><D>8.00 </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Styrene <D>0.1 </D><D>\2\ 0.1 </D><D>.005 </D><D>10.00 </D><D>9.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene <D>2.0 </D><D>2.0 </D><D>0.005 </D><D>14.00 </D><D>5.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,3,5-TP (Silvex) <D>0.05 </D><D>0.05 </D><D>0.002 </D><D>8.00 </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylene <D>10.0 </D><D>10.0 </D><D>0.005 </D><D>14.00 </D><D>6.00</D><F>\1\ For large surface systems serving andgreater;1,000,000 people, seeTable 27.</F><F>\2\ For styrene EPA is also proposing an MCL of .005 based on a groupB</F><T2>2</T2> classification.

However, the proposed MCLGs forcarcinogens are zero, a level which by definition is not ``feasible'' becauseno analytical method is capable of determining whether a contaminant levelis zero. The lowest level which can be reliably measured is the PQL. Asdescribed in section IV-A above, EPA calculated PQLs for most SOCs, atten times the interlaboratory method detection limit. For toxaphene, EDB,and PCBs, EPA set the PQL at five times the interlaboratory method detectionlimit because the Agency believes that the carcinogenic risks posed bythese three contaminants justify slightly less precision in measurementin order to obtain a more stringent level of control. EPA believes thatsetting the MCL equal to the PQL for each carcinogen contaminant is asclose to the MCLG level as feasible. EPA also calculated the per capita costs to remove the SOC contaminantsto or below the MCL using GAC or PTA. These costs range from $8.00 to $36.00per household per year. EPA believes these costs are reasonable and proposesthe MCLs at the levels listed in Table 29. Though EPA is proposing an MCL for pentachlorophenol at 0.2 mg/l basedupon EPA's Group D carcinogen ranking, there is considerable evidence whichcould result in reclassification to Group B2. Based upon a B2 classification,the MCLG would be zero and the MCL would be set at the PQL of 0.0001 mg/l.EPA requests comment on this issue and whether an MCL of 0.0001 mg/l isfeasible. C. Treatment Technique for Acrylamide and Epichlorohydrin; Guidance forStyrene The Agency evaluated the analytical methods to measure acrylamide, epichlorohydrin,and styrene drinking water concentrations. Currently analytical methodsdo not exist which accurately measure, at any level, acrylamide and epichlorohydrinconcentrations in drinking water. Thus, for these two contaminants, EPAbelieves that it is not technologically feasible to ascertain their levelin drinking water. The SDWA authorizes EPA to promulgate a treatment techniquein lieu of an MCL when analysis is not feasible. Consequently, EPA is proposinga treatment technique for both acrylamide and epichlorohydrin. EPA willcontinue to conduct research on analytical methods for these contaminants.Although analytical methods exist to determine styrene in drinking water(described in section V), styrene may not be stable in all drinking waterssince it appears to react with chlorine. Therefore, in addition to an MCL,EPA is providing guidance for public water systems using polymers containingstyrene. EPA recommends that public water systems follow this guidanceto minimize the amount of styrene which may enter the drinking water supply.Acrylamide, epichlorohydrin, and styrene are introduced as impurities inwater treatment chemicals and contact surfaces primarily during water treatment,storage and distribution. These chemicals are present in polymers and copolymersused as coagulant aids and ion exchange resins in water treatment processesand as grout and protective paints in the interior of water tanks and pipes.Polyacrylamide used as flocculant is extremely water soluble and is notexpected to be removed during normal treatment. Styrene-divinylbenzenecross-linked copolymer, which is the basic resin material for ion exchangemedia, may contain residual styrene. The use of acrylamide, epichlorohydrin,and styrene polymers is widespread in drinking water systems and highlydesirable because these materials are effective in removing other drinkingwater contaminants. Because a large segment of the U.S. population maybe exposed to these substances, EPA is proposing a treatment techniquefor acrylamide and epichlorohydrin to limit the exposure via drinking water.Because no standardized analytical methods exist to determine acrylamideand epichlorohydrin in drinking water and accurate measurement of styrenemay be complicated by styrene's decomposition in chlorinated water, EPAbelieves that limiting their introduction into drinking water via treatmentappears to be the most effective means to reduce exposure to these contaminants.In determining the proposed treatment techniques for aclrylamide, epichlorohydrinand guidance procedures for styrene, EPA is relying upon information anddata collected during operation of EPA's Drinking Water Additives AdvisoryProgram. EPA formerly operated this program to provide technical assistanceto concerned parties in evaluating drinking water additives products. Dueto resource constraints, the Agency has decided to terminate this federalprogram and is seeking to help establish a program in the private sector.See 53 FR 25586 (July 7, 1986). <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Acrylamide </ITAG>EPA proposes to control human exposure to acrylamide by limiting the levelthat may be used in products used during the treatment of drinking water.EPA is proposing that this level be based on the lowest level of the monomerwhich can be achieved by current manufacturing technology. EPA determinedduring operation of the Drinking Water Additives Advisory Program thatthe level of residual monomer in the polymer product can be reliably measured.This level is measured regularly by polymer manufacturers who certify suchlevels to EPA, utilities, and State authorities. Under the proposed rule,water systems must certify to the State that the amount of residual monomerin the polymer and the dosage rate do not exceed specified levels. Under the Drinking Water Additives Advisory Program, the maximum acceptablelevel of acrylamide in polyacrylamide was 0.05 percent. The maximum uselevel of polyacrylamide as a flocculant was 1 ppm. The acrylamide guidancelevel was adopted from the FDA regulations for polyacrylamide as a secondarydirect food additive. This level of acrylamide is considered to be thelowest feasible level that can be achieved using available manufacturingpractices. Therefore, the proposed treatment technique requires that PWSsnot exceed these levels when acrylamide is used during water treatment.EPA has estimated the possible exposure that might occur as a result ofthis treatment technique in order to assure that this approach adequatelyprotects the public against the carcinogenic effects of acrylamide. EPAbelieves that using polyacrylamide as a flocculating agent is the majorsource of potential contamination of drinking water by acrylamide. Therefore,EPA has estimated that approximately 90 percent of acrylamide in waterresults from this use. The remaining 10 percent is estimated to be contributedfrom other sources, including quantities present in raw water and leachingfrom polyacrylamide containing adhesives, grouts and paints in contactwith drinking water. If one makes the worst case assumption that all ofthe residual monomer remains in water during flocculation this yields amaximum of 0.0005 mg/l acrylamide in finished water. Taking into accountexposure through leaching of polyacrylamide materials, total, human exposureto acrylamide via drinking water will at a maximum be, approximately 0.00055mg/l.EPA believes this estimate of the acrylamide in finished water is highbecause most of the acrylamide will hydrolize or otherwise react to reducethe monomer level. However, the upperbound theoretical estimated excesscancer risk at the above concentration is 5andmultiply;10^\5\ for a 70-kgadult who ingests 2 liters of drinking water per day over a 70-year lifetime.This estimate represents the upper 95 percent confidence limit from extrapolationsprepared by EPA's Cancer Assessment Group using the linearized multistagemodel. This risk level falls within the 10^\4\ to 10^\6\ range generallyconsidered by the Agency as acceptable. Several analytical methods have recently been reported in the literaturefor the detection of acrylamide in drinking water in the parts per billionrange [see Daughton, C.G. 1988. ``Quantitation of Acrylamide (and Polyacrylamide):Critical Review of Methods for Trace Determination/Formulation Analysisand Future Research Recommendations''; Report prepared for the CaliforniaPublic Health Foundation, Berkeley, CA; and Letterman, Raymond D. and Pero,Richard W. 1988. ``Polyelectrolyte Coagulants in Water Treatment as Assessmentof Research Needs''; Report prepared for the AWWA Research Foundation,July 1988]. These methods have not been validated by EPA for analysis ofdrinking water samples and determinations of method detection limits (MDLs)and practical quantitation levels (PQLs). EPA will study the usefulness of these methods for this regulation. IfEPA determines that the method is technologically and economically feasible,the establishment of an MCL for acrylamide may be appropriate. If an MCLis established, the level would depend upon the feasibility of attainment,the detection limit, the PQL, cost and carcinogenic risk. At this time,these factors have not been determined. EPA anticipates that under an MCL,monitoring would be tied to system vulnerability based on the use of polyacrylamide.If EPA determines that it is feasible to establish an MCL for this contaminant,the Agency will solicit comment on a proposed MCL at that time. EPA requestscomments on the alternative of establishing an MCL and the potential methodologiesto analyze acrylamide in drinking water. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Epichlorohydrin </ITAG>Several epichlorohydrin polymers and copolymers were accepted as flocculatingagents by EPA's Drinking Water Additives Advisory Program. Epichlorohydrinpolymers and copolymers are also used as contact surfaces for drinkingwater storage and distribution facilities. The most common residual epichlorohydrinconcentration accepted in flocculating agents by EPA's Drinking Water AdditivesAdvisory Program was 0.01 percent at a maximum usage rate of 20 ppm, thoughsome flocculating agents were accepted at lower levels. EPA proposes thatthe maximum residual epichlorohydrin content concentration in flocculatingagents shall not exceed .01 percent at a maximum usage rate of 20 ppm.To evaluate the possible health effects associated with the .01 percentlevel, EPA conservatively assumed that all the residual epichlorohydrinmonomer remains following flocculation. This results in an epichlorohydrinconcentration in treated water of 0.002 mg/l. If one assumes, as was asumedwith regard to acrylamide, that 10 percent of the total epichlorohydrinin drinking water is introduced from indirect sources (leaching from contactsurfaces) and the remaining 90 percent is derived from epichlorohydrin-containingflocculating agents, the nominal epichlorohydrin concentration in drinkingwater would be 0.0022 mg/l. At 0.0022 mg/l the upper bound hypotheticalcancer risk calculated using the multistage model (95 percent upper confidencelimit) for a 70-kg adult consuming 2 liters of water per day over a 70-yearlifetime would be 6andmultiply;10^\7\ (EPA/CAG). The regulations for epichlorohydrin in drinking water are based upon limitationson conditions of use of epichlorohydrin-based polymers as part of a treatmenttechnique and polymer quality specifications based upon available manufacturingtechnology. Epichlorohydrin-based polymers employed as indirect additives in drinkingwater must contain no more than 0.01 percent residual epichlorohydrin,assuming a maximum dose of 20 ppm of polymer. The Food and Drug Administration(FDA) has established residual levels of .001 percent for certain foodadditive applications (21 CFR 173.60). EPA requests comments concerningwhether FDA's food additive limitations are relevant to the Agency's proposedstandard for epichlorohydrin-based drinking water applications. Based upon information available to date, EPA believes the 0.01 percentlevel represents the lowest feasible attainable level since products containing0.01 percent epichlorohydrin are widely available at no incremental costto public water systems. If products with less epichlorohydrin are available,systems may use them. However, given the extremely low risks of the 0.01percent level proposed by EPA, lower residual levels would offer negligibleimprovements to public health. In addition, such products may be more costlyfor public water systems. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Styrene </ITAG>EPA proposes an MCL of 0.005 mg/l and 0.1 mg/l for styrene (see SectionV of this proposal). However, EPA recognizes that measurement of styrenemay be problematic in certain instances. EPA believes that recommendinga guidance level for styrene in styrene copolymers used as additives canreduce further styrene exposure via drinking water. EPA's Drinking WaterAdditives Advisory Program recommended several styrene copolymers as secondarydirect additives (e.g., as ion exchange resins, coagulant aids, etc.).Among styrene copolymers, the lowest styrene residual monomer concentrationis 0.09 ppm at a recommended dose of 20 mg/l. Assuming that all the residualstyrene associated with the polymer remains in water, this would resultin a styrene concentration of 0.000002 mg/l. Because EPA's Drinking Water Additives Advisory Program data base on therange of residual styrene concentrations in styrene copolymers was somewhatlimited, the technology to produce styrene copolymers at 0.09 ppm may notbe commonly available for use by PWSs throughout the United States. Consequently,a ten-fold upward adjustment for the minimum residual concentration (i.e.,0.9 ppm), was used to account for this uncertainty. At this residual concentrationand an application rate of 20 mg/l the concentration in water under worstcase conditions would be 0.00002 mg/l. This concentration level is stillsignificantly lower than the proposed MCLs for styrene. EPA recommends that styrene copolymers intended for use as ion-exchangeresins follow additional use restrictions: (1) The resin bed should bethoroughly cleaned by washing with a minimum of five bed volumes of waterprior to distributing water to consumers; (2) the rinse water should bediscarded; (3) the temperature of the water passing through the resin bedshould be maintained at 25 anddegrees;C or less; and (4) the flow rate ofthe water passing through the bed should be more than 2 gallons/cubic ft/minute.These use conditions are adapted from FDA regulations governing the useof polymeric styrene-divinylbenzene ion exchange resins for treatment ofbulk quantities of aqueous food and water (21 CFR 173.25).<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Summary </ITAG>The approaches described above for controlling acrylamide, epichlorohydrin,and styrene occurrence in drinking water are based on the lowest monomerlevel which is achievable with current manufacturing technology. Theselevels were determined by EPA through its experience with the DrinkingWater Additive Advisory Program. The resulting monomer levels in polymericdrinking water additives are 0.0005 mg/l for acrylamide and 0.002 mg/lfor epichlorohydrin. 0.00002 mg/l is also recommended as the monomer levelwhen styrene is used as an additive. Compliance for acrylamide and epichlorohydrinwill be determined by water systems certifying to the State that the combinationof dose and monomer level in the product do not exceed these specifiedmonomer levels. Similarly, a recommended treatment technique for styreneis provided in this notice in addition to the MCL. Each public water system must annually certify to the State that it achievesthe specified levels by not exceeding the specified dosage levels. Foracrylamide, the public water system may not exceed 0.05 percent acrylamidein polyacrylamide dosed at 1 ppm. For epichlorohydrin, the public watersystem may not exceed 0.01 percent residual epichlorohydrin concentrationdosed at 20 ppm. For styrene, EPA recommends that public water systemsnot exceed 1 ppm in styrene copolymers used as direct additives and asresins. Public comments are requested on the treatment control approachdescribed above for acrylamide, epichlorohydrin and the guidance for controllingstyrene. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Variances and Exemptions </ITAG>A. Variances Under section 1415(a)(1)(A) of the SDWA, EPA or a State which has primaryenforcement responsibility (i.e., primacy) may grant variances from MCLsto those public water systems that cannot comply with the MCLs becauseof characteristics of the water sources that are reasonably available.A variance may only be granted to those systems which have installed BATas identified by EPA pursuant to section 1415. Though EPA is not proposingthat BATs meet specified performance criteria, EPA solicits comments onthis issue. EPA at the time of final promulgation of this rule may specifyminimum performance criteria before a variance is issued. Furthermore, before EPA or a State may grant a variance, it must find thatthe variance will not result in an unreasonable risk to health. The levelsrepresenting an unreasonable risk to health for each of the contaminantsin this proposal will be addressed in a subsequent <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. In general, the unreasonable risk tohealth level would reflect acute and subchronic toxicity for short-termexposures and high carcinogenic risks for long-term exposures (as calculatedusing the linearized multistage model in accordance with the Agency's riskassessment guidelines). Under section 1413(a)(4), States that choose to issue variances must doso under conditions, and in a manner, which are no less stringent thanEPA allows in section 1415. States may adopt standards which are more stringentthan the EPA standards. EPA specifies BATs for variance purposes. EPA may vary its BAT findingsunder section 1415 for variances from its BAT findings under section 1412for MCLs depending on a number of factors, including system size, physicalconditions related to engineering feasibility, and MCL compliance costs.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Best Available Technology for Inorganic Compounds </ITAG>Table 30 shows the BATs that EPA is proposing for variance purposes forinorganic compounds. EPA has not proposed coagulation/filtration or limesoftening as BAT for small systems (i.e., those systems ;500 connections)for the purpose of granting variances because they are not technologicallyfeasible for small systems, as noted below. Coagulation/filtration and lime softening of the heavy metals (i.e., barium,cadmium, chromium, mercury and selenium) are more complex than conventionaltreatment (i.e., treatment for turbidity removal). Their complexity resultsin the need for increased operating time and expertise to operate coagulation/filtrationand lime softening systems. This complexity is a result of: (a) Generallyhigher pH requirements for precipitation of heavy metals than for turbidity;(b) differences in coagulant selection, generally favoring the iron salts;(c) much higher doses of coagulants or lime to precipitate heavy metalsthan for conventional turbidity removal or lime softening; and (d) largersedimentation basins and possible two-stage processes (one for turbiditysoftening and one for metals precipitation). Consequently, EPA believescoagulation/filtration and lime softening are too complex, as measuredby operating time and the level of expertise required, for small systems.Costs of installing and operating reverse osmosis, activated alumina, andion exchange are relatively high for small systems compared to large systems.EPA requests comment on whether these technologies should constitute BATfor small systems under section 1415. EPA is continuing to evaluate whatcosts are reasonable for public water systems. Commenters are encouragedto provide comment on what should constitute BAT for small systems. TheAgency is currently developing affordability criteria and will requestpublic comment on those criteria in a separate notice. After public commentthe Agency may use them in this rulemaking. With regard to BAT under section 1415, EPA requests comment on: (1) Whetherother technologies should be considered BAT under section 1415 for theIOCs; (2) whether it is appropriate to exclude coagulation/filtration andlime softening for small systems; and (3) the appropriateness of reverseosmosis (RO), ion exchange and activated alumina as BAT under section 1415for small systems. EPA notes that RO offers the benefit of multiple contaminantremoval and desalting, which makes RO technology especially attractivefor some drinking water systems, including small systems.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 30._<T4>BAT for IOCs for Variances</T4><H1>Inorganic contaminant</H1><H1>Best available technologies</H1><H2>Activated alumina</H2><H2>Coagulation/filtration \1\</H2><H2>Corrosion control</H2><H2>Direct andamp; diatomite flitration</H2><H2>Granular activated carbon</H2><H2>Ion exchange</H2><H2>Lime softening \1\</H2><H2>Reverse osmosis</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Asbestos<D/><D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D><D/><D/><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium<D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D/><D>X</D><D>X</D><D/><D/><D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium III<D/><D>X</D><D/><D/><D/><D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium VI<D/><D>X</D><D/><D/><D/><D>X</D><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury<D/><D>X \2\</D><D/><D/><D>X</D><D/><D>X \2\</D><D>X \2\</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrate and nitrite<D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>X</D><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium IV (selenite)<D>X</D><D>X</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium VI (selenate)<D>X</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>X</D><D>X</D><F>\1\ Not BAT for systems less than 500 service connections.</F><F>\2\ BAT only if influent mercury concentrations do not exceed 10 ug/1.Coagulation/Filtration for mercury removal includes PAC addition or post-filtrationGAC column where high organic mercury is present in source water.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Best Available Technology for Synthetic Organic Chemicals </ITAG>EPA proposes granular activated carbon as BAT for SOCs under section 1415for all size systems (see Table 23). PTA is proposed as BAT for the volatileSOCs and EDB and DBCP. EPA believes these technologies, as discussed inSection IV, are technologically and economically feasible for all sizesystems. EPA, however, specificially requests comment on whether PTA should be BATunder section 1415 for DBCP and EDB in light of the fact that air to waterratios of greater than 100 would be required for 90 to 99 percent removal,resulting in increased costs. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Use of POU Devices and Bottled Water </ITAG>Under section 1415(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act, when the State grants a variance,it must prescribe an implementation schedule of any additional requiredcontrol measures. The State may require the use of POU devices, bottledwater, or other mitigating measures as ``additional control measures''as a condition if an unreasonable risk to health exists. EPA has previouslypromulgated regulations specifying when POU devices and bottled water maybe used. (See 52 FR 25690, 25701-25702, and 25708, July 8, 1987.) Thisproposed rule would extend those provisions to cover the contaminants inthis notice. EPA's explanation for those provisions was explained in theJuly 8, 1987 rulemaking. B. Exemptions Under section 1416(a), a State or EPA may grant an exemption extendingdeadlines for compliance with a treatment technique or MCL if it findsthat (1) due to compelling factors (which may include economic factors),the PWS is unable to comply with the requirement; (2) the exemption willnot result in an unreasonable risk to human health; and (3) the systemwas in operation on the effective date of the NPDWR, or, for a system notin operation on that date, that no reasonable alternative source of drinkingwater is available to the new system. If EPA or a State grants an exemption it must at the same time prescribea compliance schedule (including increments of progress) and it may specifyappropriate control measures that the system must meet while the exemptionis effective. Under section 1416(2)(A), the schedule must require compliancewithin one year after issuance of the exemption. However, section 1416(b)(2)(B)states that EPA or the State may extend the final compliance date for aperiod not to exceed three years, if the public water system is takingall practicable steps to comply and one of the following conditions applies:(1) The system cannot comply without capital improvements which cannotbe completed within the period of the exemption; (2) in the case of a systemwhich needs financial assistance for the necessary implementation, thesystem has entered into an agreement to obtain financial assistance; or(3) the system has entered into an enforceable agreement to become partof a regional public water system. For public water systems which serveless than 500 service connections and which need financial assistance forthe necessary improvements, EPA or the State may renew an exemption forone or more additional two-year periods if the system establishes thatit is taking all practicable steps to meet the requirements noted above.Under section 1416(d), EPA is required to review State-issued exemptionsat least every three years and, if the Administrator finds that a Statehas, in a substantial number of instances, abused its discretion in grantingexemptions or failed to prescribe schedules in accordance with the statute,the Administrator, after following established procedures, may revoke ormodify those exemptions and schedules. EPA will use these procedures toscrutinize exemptions granted by States and, if appropriate, may revokeor modify exemptions.As a condition for receiving an exemption, the State may require the useof POU devices or bottled water for the duration of the exemption. Theexemption conditions are the same as those referenced in the variance section.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Compliance Monitoring Requirements </ITAG>A. Background Compliance monitoring requirements are proposed to determine whether community(CWS) and non-transient, non-community water systems and transient non-communitywater systems (for nitrate/nitrite only) supply drinking water that meetsthe MCLs. EPA is proposing these monitoring requirements under section1445 of the SDWA. Although section 1412(b) of the SDWA provides that the National PrimaryDrinking Water Regulations (as described in section 1401) take effect 18months after their promulgation, under section 1445 there is no such limitationfor monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping regulations. To allow themonitoring requirements to be effective within 30 days of promulgation,EPA proposes to promulgate these regulations under section 1445. Effective18 months after promulgation, the monitoring requirements will also bedeemed to be promulgated under section 1412. This change will allow systemsto complete monitoring and analysis by the effective date of the MCLs (effectivedate of the MCLs are 18 months after promulgation of this regulation).Each contaminant in this proposed rule is classified using the three-tieredapproach (presented in the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking publishedon October 5, 1983, 48 FR 45502). The tiers are as follows: <T3>Tier I_</T3>Those contaminants which occur with sufficient frequency,are of sufficient concern to warrant national regulation (MCLs), and thereforerequire uniform monitoring and reporting (M/R) requirements. <T3>Tier II_</T3>Those contaminants which occur with limited frequency,are of sufficient concern to warrant national regulation (MCLs), and thereforejustify flexible monitoring requirements based on vulnerability assessments.<T3>Tier III_</T3>Those contaminants which occur with limited frequencyand are not of sufficient concern to warrant development of a nationalregulation (MCL), but for which EPA may provide non-regulatory health guidanceto States and water systems. The main difference between Tier I and II contaminants is the probabilityand predictability of occurrence, although the health implications of contaminantsin the two groups may be similar. The three-tiered approach was developedto provide a framework for developing both MCL and monitoring requirementsbased on the health significance of the contaminants in drinking water,the occurrence, and the predictability of occurrence or potential occurrence.EPA proposes to classify all inorganic contaminants in this proposal asTier II contaminants except nitrate and nitrite, which are classified asTier I contaminants. This proposed classification is based in part on therecommendations from a Workshop on Revised Drinking Water Regulations forInorganics and Corrosion By-products held on June 4-6, 1985. The resultsfrom this workshop are summarized in the Methods and Monitoring Documentfor Inorganic Contaminants. Nitrate and nitrite are proposed as Tier I contaminants because the presenceof nitrates is widespread in drinking water supplies and their presenceis associated with acute adverse health effects in infants. In addition,nitrate/nitrite occurrence is expected to continue due to the widespreaduse of fertilizers. All the SOCs are proposed as Tier II contaminants. Tier II includes thosecontaminants whose occurrence may be predictable in drinking water basedupon a multiplicity of factors such as geological conditions, use patterns(e.g., pesticides), type of source, historic record, or the nature of thedistribution system. Tier II contaminants appear to warrant giving Statesdiscretion so that monitoring requirements are tailored to local conditions.Thus, although compliance with the MCL is required in all cases, EPA isproviding States the latitude to tailor monitoring requirements for eachsystem provided the minimum Federal standards are met. EPA has divided the SOCs into two groups to propose monitoring requirements:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><H1> </H1><H1> </H1> Group A_Ten Volatile Synthetic Organic Chemicals (VOCs)<ITAG tagnum="2">cis-1,2-Dichloroethylene <D>Toluene. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1,2-Dichloropropane <D>trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">o-Dichlorobenzene <D>Xylenes (total) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Ethylbenzene <D>Tetrachloroethylene </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Monochlorobenzene <D>Styrene.</D></ITAG>Group B_SOCs: Eighteen Pesticides and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)<ITAG tagnum="2">Alachlor <D>Ethylene dibromide (EDB). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Aldicarb <D>Heptachlor </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Aldicarb sulfone <D>Heptachlor Epoxide </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Aldicarb sulfoxide <D>Lindane </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Atrazine <D>Methoxychlor </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Carbofuran <D>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Chlordane <D>Pentachlorophenol </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Dibromochloropropane (DBCP) <D>Toxaphene </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2,4-D <D>2,4,5-TP (Silvex).</D></ITAG></ITAG> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">EPA has separated the SOCs into two groups for three reasons. First,the sources and mechanisms of contamination of drinking water are differentfor Groups A and B. VOCs are most likely to occur in areas with considerableindustrial activity, while pesticides are most likely to occur in areaswith considerable agricultural activity. Second, the available occurrencedata indicate that the presence of VOCs is more widespread throughout theU.S. than the presence of pesticides. Therefore pesticide monitoring canbe targeted based on knowledge of pesticide use and cropping patterns.Third, the same analytical methods are used to monitor all the VOCs inGroup A, while different techniques are needed to monitor the pesticidesand PCBs in Group B. In developing the proposed compliance monitoring requirements for thesecontaminants, EPA considered:(1) The likely source of drinking water contamination, (2) differencesbetween ground and surface water systems, (3) samples which are representativeof consumer exposure, (4) sample collection and analysis costs, (5) useof historical monitoring data which identifies vulnerable systems and subsequentlyspecifies monitoring requirements for vulnerable systems, (6) the limitedoccurrence of some contaminants, and (7) the need for States to tailormonitoring requirements to system-specific conditions. Monitoring requirements for surface and ground water systems are addressedseparately because: (1) The sources and mechanisms of contamination forground and surface water systems are different, (2) the overall qualityof surface waters tends to change more rapidly with time than does thequality of ground waters, (3) seasonal variations tend to affect surfacewaters more than ground waters, and (4) spatial variations are more importantin ground waters than in surface waters since groundwater contaminationis often a localized problem confined to one or several wells within asystem. Therefore, monitoring frequency is an important factor for surfacewater systems while sampling location is important for groundwater systems.The proposed monitoring requirements require surface water systems to monitormore frequently than groundwater systems. EPA desires monitoring requirements which ensure the statutory goal ofcompliance with the MCLs and efficiently utilize State and utility resources.A major goal is to ensure these monitoring requirements are consistentwith monitoring requirements promulgated previously by EPA. The monitoringprogram proposed by EPA focuses monitoring in individual public water systemsto the contaminants that are likely to occur. This approach includes: andbullet; For the volatile SOCs listed in andSection; 141.61(a), allowingStates to reduce monitoring frequencies based upon a vulnerability assessment.For the pesticides and PCBs listed in andSection; 141.61(c), requiring onlyvulnerable systems to monitor. andbullet; Allowing States to target monitoring to those systems which arevulnerable to a particular contaminant. andbullet; Allowing the use of recent monitoring data in lieu of new dataif the system has conducted a monitoring program using reliable analyticalmethods. andbullet; Encouraging the States to use historical monitoring data meetingspecified quality requirements and other available records to make decisionsregarding a system's vulnerability. andbullet; Requiring all vulnerable systems to conduct repeat monitoringunless the system demonstrates that its vulnerability status has changed.andbullet; Designating sampling locations and frequencies that permit simultaneousmonitoring for all regulated contaminants, whenever possible. andbullet; Requiring that samples be taken during high vulnerability timesfor those contaminants whose concentration may fluctuate seasonally (e.g.,nitrates, pesticides). B. Rounding of Analytical Results for Compliance Determination The procedure to be followed in determining compliance with the revisedregulations for both the inorganic and organic chemicals is as follows:Data reported to the State or EPA should contain the same number of significantdigits as the MCL. In calculating data for compliance purposes, numbersshould be rounded off to one significant digit. The last significant digitshould be increased by one unit if the digit dropped is 5, 6, 7, 8, or9. If the digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, the preceding number does not change.For example, analytical results for mercury of 0.0016 mg/l would be reportedas 0.002 mg/l, while results of 0.23 mg/l for pentachlorophenol would bereported as 0.2 mg/l. For nitrate, results of 10.4 mg/l would be roundedto 10 mg/l, while a value of 10.6 mg/l would be rounded to 11 mg/l andwould be in violation of the MCL.C. Inorganic Chemical Monitoring Requirements <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction </ITAG>EPA proposes to change the existing monitoring requirements for barium,cadmium, chromium, mercury, nitrate, and selenium and proposes new monitoringrequirements for asbestos and nitrite. In addition, EPA proposes to reorganizethe current fluoride monitoring requirements in andSection; 141.23(g) andinclude fluoride in the monitoring requirements applicable to barium, cadmium,etc. Including fluoride in the requirements applicable to the other inorganicsis not a substantive change from existing requirements and serves to simplifythe inorganic monitoring requirements. EPA believes that the inorganic contaminant sampling and analytical costsare reasonable and that sufficient analytical capability currently existsto analyze all inorganic contaminants except asbestos (see the discussionunder the Analytical Methods, Section IV-A). To provide enough time forlaboratory capabilities to expand, EPA is proposing that water supply systemsbe allowed to complete the first round of monitoring requirements for asbestoswithin five years of publication of the final rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Dates for Completion of Initial Monitoring </ITAG>The new MCLs being promulgated under section 1412 of the Act (see proposedandSection; 141.62), will not become effective until 18 months after promulgation.Prior to that time the existing MCLs (see andSection; 141.11) will remainin effect. Effective thirty days after promulgation, the monitoring requirements containedin the final rule will replace existing monitoring provisions containedin 40 CFR 141.23. Proposed andSection; 141.23 notes that the new monitoringrequirements for inorganics will apply to both the existing MCLs and thenew MCLs being promulgated by EPA ``as appropriate.'' This provision meansthat the new monitoring requirements must be followed in determining compliancewith the existing MCLs until those MCLs are superceded by the new MCLsbeing promulgated at andSection; 141.62. EPA believes it is appropriate torequire systems to follow the new monitoring requirements in determiningcompliance with existing MCLs for several reasons. First, the new monitoringprovisions are not significantly different from the current monitoringprotocols being followed by water systems, and changing to the new proceduresshould therefore not be difficult. Second, since systems will have to completemonitoring for the new MCLs within 18 months in any case, applying thenew monitoring provisions for the existing MCLs will eliminate the needfor duplicative monitoring to determine compliance with the existing andnew MCLs. Under this proposal community water systems are required to complete theinitial round of monitoring for barium, cadmium, chromium, nitrate, nitrite,mercury and selenium and report the results to the State within 18 monthsof promulgation; non-transient, non-community water systems must completethe initial round of monitoring and report the results to the State withinfour years of promulgation. Since virtually all non-transient, non-communitywater systems are small systems serving less than 3,300 persons, this proposalis consistent with previous EPA proposals to phase in monitoring requirementsbased on system size. For asbestos, both community and non-transient, non-communitysystems that are vulnerable to asbestos contamination must complete allmonitoring and report the results to the State within five years of promulgation.EPA requests comments on allowing non-transient, non-community systemsfour years to complete inorganics monitoring and five years for communityand non-transient, non-community water systems to complete the asbestosmonitoring. Comment is particularly requested on whether non-transient,non-community water systems should have up to four years to complete theinitial sampling for nitrate/nitrite or whether these systems should completethat sampling sooner. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Sampling Location </ITAG>Under the proposed regulation, surface water systems must sample at pointsin the distribution system which are representative of each source or ateach entry point to the distribution system which is located after anytreatment and which is representative of each source. The number of sampleswill be determined by the number of sources or treatment plants. For groundwatersystems, sampling must be done at each entry point to the distributionsystem after treatment. The number of samples a system must take will bedetermined by the number of entry points. EPA believes this approach willmake it easier to pinpoint possible contaminated sources (wells) withina system. In both surface and ground water systems, the proposed samplinglocations are such that the same sampling locations may be used for thecollection of samples for other source-related contaminants such as thevolatile organic chemicals, which simplifies sample collection efforts.The only exception would be for asbestos, where if the system has asbestos/cement(A/C) pipes, sampling must be at a tap served by asbestos cement pipe.Inorganic sampling (except for nitrate/nitrite) may be conducted at anytime. Nitrate/nitrite sampling must be conducted at the time when the systemis most susceptible to contamination. This generally occurs after rainand after the application of fertilizers when there may be fertilizer runoff.EPA is proposing nitrate sampling at the time the system is most vulnerableto ensure that monitoring detects contamination when it is most likelyto occur. This proposed rule relates primarily to contaminants that enter drinkingwater due to contamination of source waters. However, in some cases contaminationmay occur as a by-product of corrosion in the water delivery system. EPAhas proposed monitoring requirements for corrosion by-products (i.e., leadand copper) in another rule. Monitoring for such corrosion by-productsgenerally occurs at the tap in order to ensure that contamination due tocorrosion is detected. Two contaminants addressed by this proposal arepotential corrosion by-products: cadmium and asbestos. Cadmium present in some galvanized iron pipes in the distribution systemhas the potential to leach into the drinking water. Present evidence indicatesthat the cadmium contribution from galvanized iron pipes is insignificant.EPA therefore believes that cadmium exposure from drinking water primarilyresults from cadmium in the source water. Therefore, cadmium monitoringrequirements in the proposed rule are designed to detect source-relatedcontamination. Asbestos may also be present at the tap (in addition to in the source)due to corrosion of A/C pipe that is used in some distribution systems.Where the potential exists for asbestos contamination due to corrosion,EPA proposes that sampling be conducted at the tap. The proposed monitoringrequirements for asbestos are explained in more detail below. Public comments are requested on the proposed requirements related to monitoringlocations.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Monitoring Frequency </ITAG><T3>Barium, cadmium, chromium, mercury, and selenium:</T3> Under this proposal,groundwater systems must monitor every three years and surface water systemsmust monitor annually. The State may reduce the three year and one yearmonitoring frequencies to no less than every ten years provided: (1) Surfacesystems have monitored annually for at least three years and groundwatersystems have conducted at least three rounds of monitoring; and (2) allprevious analytical results are andless;50 percent of the MCL. Systems usinga new water source are not eligible for reduced monitoring until threerounds of monitoring from the new source are completed. States should basetheir decision on the reduced monitoring frequency for each system on considerationof historical analytical results, variations in the historical results,and system changes such as pumping rates or stream flows/characteristics.EPA is proposing to allow States to reduce the inorganic monitoring frequencieswhere an adequate baseline of data has been collected because EPA believesthat drinking water contamination by most IOCs is highly stable over time.Therefore, those systems that can demonstrate to the State that there isa remote possibility that the system will exceed the MCL can be allowedto monitor on a less frequent basis. <T3>Asbestos:</T3> Systems determined by the State to be vulnerable toasbestos contamination after a vulnerability assessment are required tocomplete one round of monitoring within 5 years of promulgation of thefinal rule. If the asbestos concentration in the initial round is <T2>andCx.170;</T2>50 percent of the MCL, then groundwater systems must monitorevery three years and surface water systems must monitor annually. If theinitial results are andless;50 percent of the MCL, then the State can determinethe repeat monitoring frequency. EPA believes it is appropriate to basethe repeat monitoring frequency on the analytical results of the initialmonitoring because it believes that the possibility of the system exceedingthe MCL in the future is remote where the initial results are andless;50percent of the MCL. Consequently, repeat monitoring in cases where theresult is andless;50 percent of the MCL would not be required by the rule.Public comment is requested on this approach. <T3>Nitrate and Nitrite_Community and Non-Transient, Non-Community WaterSystems:</T3> Under the proposed rule, groundwater systems must monitorannually for nitrate and nitrite. Groundwater systems must however, monitorquarterly when the concentration is <T2>andCx.170;</T2>50 percent of the MCL(s) for any one sample. The samplingfrequency must remain quarterly until four consecutive quarterly samplesare andless;50 percent of the MCL(s). Surface water systems must monitorquarterly. Surface water systems may sample annually provided all analyticresults from four consecutive quarters are andless;50 percent of the MCL(s).Surface water systems must return to quarterly monitoring if any one sampleis <T2>andCx.170;</T2>50 percent of the MCL(s). <T3>Nitrate and Nitrite_Transient, Non-Community Water Systems:</T3> EPAis proposing to change the current nitrate monitoring requirements fortransient, non-community water systems from monitoring at the discretionof the State to a minimum of every three years for groundwater systemsand annually for surface water systems for both nitrate and nitrite. EPAbelieves this change for transient, non-community water systems is appropriatedue to the widespread presence of these contaminants in drinking waterand because they are associated with acute health effects in infants. EPArequests comments on the proposed monitoring frequencies for nitrate andnitrite for transient, non-community water systems and whether the frequenciesare adequate to protect customers in such systems. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Confirmation Samples </ITAG><T3>Asbestos, barium, cadmium, chromium, mercury, selenium:</T3> If ananalytical result indicates that the contaminant level in a system exceedsthe MCL, the proposed rule provides that the State may require the systemto take a confirmation sample. The confirmation sample must be taken withintwo weeks after the system is notified of the analytical result and mustbe taken at the same sampling point as the original sample.<T3>Nitrate and Nitrite: </T3>If an analytical result indicates the systemwill exceed the MCL, then the proposed rule provides that the system musttake a confirmation sample within 24 hours of notification of the analyticalresult from the first sample. Results of both samples must be reportedto the State within two weeks of the date the initial sample was taken.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Compliance Determination </ITAG>For systems which are monitoring quarterly, compliance with the MCLs forasbestos, barium, cadmium, chromium, mercury, and selenium is determinedby a running annual average (i.e., the last four quarterly samples) ateach sampling point. If any one quarterly sample would cause the annualaverage to be exceeded, the system is out of compliance immediately. Forexample, if the first quarterly sample were four times the MCL, the systemwould be out of compliance based on that one sample. This provision servesto provide early notification to consumers of potential health risks. Ifthe average exceeds the MCL at any sampling point, then the entire systemis out of compliance and public notification is required. For systems whichare monitoring annually or less frequently, a system is out of compliancewith the MCLs for asbestos, barium, cadmium, chromium, mercury, and seleniumif the analytical result at any sampling point exceeds the MCL. If a confirmationsample is required by the State, then the average of two samples is used.Compliance for nitrate and nitrite is based on one sample or, if the initialsample exceeds the MCL, on the average of two samples (i.e., initial andconfirmation). <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Asbestos Monitoring </ITAG>Asbestos occurs in drinking water as a result of asbestos in the raw watersupply and/or as a result of corrosion of asbestos-cement pipe in the distributionsystem. Therefore, systems must first determine whether asbestos may bea source-related problem and/or a distribution system problem before theappropriate monitoring regime is established. Because of the analyticallimitations (e.g., analytical costs, limited trained personnel and laboratorycapabilities) described above, EPA proposes that only vulnerable systemsmust monitor for asbestos. States are required to evaluate a system's vulnerabilityto asbestos contamination within 18 months of rule promulgation. The assessmentmust consider the following factors: (1) Potential contamination of thewater source and (2) the use of asbestos-cement pipes for finished waterdistribution and the corrosive nature of the water. In evaluating whether systems may be vulnerable to asbestos contaminationdue to corrosion of A/C pipe, States should consider systems to be vulnerablethat have A/C pipe as well as aggressive water. The aggressivity of wateris measured by an ``aggressive index;'' values greater than 10 indicatenonaggressive or moderately aggressive water while values below 10 indicatehighly aggressive water. If a system is determined to be vulnerable to asbestos contamination inits source water, the proposed rule provides that the system must monitorin accordance with the protocol described above for other source-relatedinorganics. If the system is vulnerable to asbestos as a corrosion by-product,then the proposed rule requires systems to take a sample at a tap servedby asbestos-cement pipe under conditions under which contamination is mostlikely to occur (i.e.,  * * * when asbestos cement and corrosive waterco-occur). If a system is vulnerable in both respects (in source waterand due to corrosion), the proposed rule requires the system to take asample at a tap served by asbestos-cement pipe under worst-case conditions.EPA believes sampling at the tap is the best approach where both sourcesof contamination are forseeable because it will detect asbestos contaminationin the source water as well as contamination due to corrosion. If sucha sample exceeds the MCL, a system may want to conduct additional monitoringto determine whether the primary cause of contamination is the source wateror due to corrosion of asbestos/cement pipe. EPA solicits comment on whethersystems determined by the State to be vulnerable due to contamination ofsource water as well as corrosion should be required to sample both atthe tap and in the distribution system.EPA also requests comment on the alternative approach of classifying eachsystem as vulnerable unless an assessment by the State determines thatthe system is not vulnerable. Under this option, all systems would be requiredto monitor for asbestos unless the State made the affirmative determinationthat the system was not vulnerable and therefore not required to monitor.Public comments are requested on all aspects of the proposed monitoringrequirements for the inorganic contaminants. D. Volatile Synthetic Organic Chemical Monitoring Requirements EPA proposes that the compliance monitoring requirements for the ten GroupA SOCs (i.e., the volatile organic compounds) be identical to the finalmonitoring requirements that have already been established for eight volatileorganic chemicals (see 52 FR 25690, July 8, 1987) because the factors affectingthe potential for contamination of drinking water are the same and thesame analytical methods used for the previously regulated VOCs are usedto measure the VOCs covered by this proposal. EPA believes this approachis the most effective way to implement this regulation since the additionof these ten compounds to the list of regulated VOCs will only increasemonitoring costs slightly. In addition, one round of monitoring for theten VOCs included in this proposal was required under the Section 1445monitoring regulations for unregulated VOCs promulgated July 8, 1987 (See52 FR 25712). Today's proposed regulation would allow the use of previousmonitoring data from the Section 1445 monitoring regulation, in lieu ofnew data, for the initial round of monitoring. EPA's rationale for proposedmonitoring requirements for the ten VOCs was previously discussed in theJuly 8, 1987 notice (52 FR 25712). EPA is also proposing a modification to the existing monitoring requirementscontained in andSection; 141.24(g)(8)(i)(B). The language in that provisionhas been interpreted to allow vulnerable systems to take only one samplein the initial year of monitoring if no VOCs are detected in the initialsample. EPA had originally intended, however, for systems that are vulnerable,to conduct quarterly sampling during the first year of monitoring. TheAgency believes that, if a system is determined to be vulnerable, thereis the potential that contamination may exist even if none is detectedin the first sample and that quarterly monitoring for at least one yearis warranted before reducing monitoring to once per year. EPA is thereforeproposing to amend andSection; 141.24(g)(8)(i)(B) in order to clarify thatvulnerable systems must conduct quarterly monitoring during the first yearregardless of whether VOCs are detected in the first sample. The proposedamendment to the existing andSection; 141.24(g)(8)(i)(B) will affect themonitoring for all VOCs, including those regulated by the rule publishedJuly 8, 1987. Given the timetable for monitoring for eight VOCs establishedin that notice, most systems will have already completed the initial yearof monitoring by the time this amendment becomes effective. Those systemsthat have not completed the initial year of monitoring will be requiredto monitor in accordance with the amended andSection; 141.24(g)(8)(i)(B).The proposed monitoring requirements for the determination of compliancewith MCLs for the Group A SOCs (i.e., VOCs) are as follows: andbullet; All systems must conduct an initial round of quarterly monitoringat least once over the four-year period following promulgation. Monitoringwill be phased in based on the system size as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,r50</C>   <H1>System size</H1><H1>Monitoring completed within</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">andgreater;10,000 persons served<D> 18 months of promulgation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3,300-10,000 persons served<D> 30 months of promulgation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andless;3,300 persons served<D> 54 months of promulgation.</D></ITAG></ITAG> andbullet; Ground water systems shall sample at points of entry to the distributionsystem after any treatment. The minimum number of samples for ground watersystems is one sample at each entry point to the distribution system, perquarter for one year. However, if a system is determined not to be vulnerable(see 50 FR 46902, November 13, 1985, and 52 FR 25690, July 8, 1987, fora definition of vulnerability) and the first quarterly sample does notdetect VOCs, States have the discretion to reduce the initial samplinground from 4 quarterly samples to that one sampling round. The total numberof samples which must be analyzed may be reduced, at State discretion,by compositing. Up to 5 samples may be composited. If VOCs are detectedin the composite, systems must take a follow-up sample at each samplingpoint which was included in the composite. Readers are referred to 52 FR25713, July 8, 1987, for a more complete discussion about compositing procedures.andbullet; Each laboratory must determine the minimum concentration at whichVOCs are detected (i.e., method detection limit (MDL) as defined in AppendixB to Part 136). This concentration must be no greater than 0.0005 mg/l.andbullet; Surface water systems are required to sample at points in thedistribution system or at each entry point to the distribution system whichare located after any treatment and which is representative of each source(called a sampling point). Each system must take one sample at each samplingpoint per quarter for one year. Composite samples from up to five sourcesare allowed. If VOCs are detected in the composite sample, follow-up monitoringat each sampling point included in the composite sample is required. andbullet; All systems are required to conduct repeat monitoring every 3or 5 years (depending upon system size) except for surface water systemsthat were not vulnerable and did not detect any VOCs in the first roundof sampling. (EPA defines the detection level as 0.0005 mg/l.) Systemswhich detect VOCs in the initial round of sampling or any subsequent roundare required to monitor quarterly. The repeat monitoring frequency is basedon prior monitoring results, system vulnerability, and system size.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,xs55,xs55 </C><T4>Schedule of Repeat Monitoring Requirements </T4><H1>Status</H1><H1> Ground water</H1><H1>Surface water \1\</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">VOCs not detected \2\ and not vulnerable<D>Repeat every 5 years </D><D>State discretion. </D></ITAG>VOCs not detected and vulnerable: <ITAG tagnum="1">Systems andgreater;500 connections <D>Repeat every 3 years </D><D>Repeat every 3 years. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Systems andgreater;500 connections <D>Repeat every 5 years </D><D>Repeat every 5 years. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">VOCs detected <D>Quarterly </D><D>Quarterly.  </D><F>\1\ Surface water systems sample during four consecutive quarters. </F><F>\2\ Detected=0.0005 mg/l.</F></ITAG></ITAG> andbullet; States have discretion to:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Require confirmation samples for positive results.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Reduce the repeat monitoring requirements for systems detecting VOCsbut at levels consistently less than the MCL.

E. Pesticide and PCB Monitoring Requirements In order to propose monitoring requirements for the pesticides and PCBs,EPA evaluated which sampling frequencies and locations provide the bestinformation on whether water delivered to the consumer complies with theMCL at reasonable sampling and analytical costs. When developing the July, 1987 VOC monitoring requirements, EPA used occurrencedata gathered primarily from EPA and State sponsored surveys. Due to theoccurrence of VOCs, the incidence of contamination was correlated withsize of the population served by the system (i.e., the likelihood of contaminationincreases for large systems). However, the occurrence data also supportedthe decision that all systems should monitor for VOCs since both smalland large systems have detected VOCs at relatively high concentrations.That decision was supported by the fact that a single analytical methodmeasures all the VOCs included in the July, 1987 notice at about $200 persample. Consequently, EPA promulgated VOC monitoring requirements thatwould first require larger systems to monitor and subsequently phase inthe smaller systems over a period of several years. EPA reasoned that largersystems could best afford the sampling and analytical costs associatedwith the monitoring and should be required to monitor first. Determining which systems should monitor for pesticides and PCBs is a morecomplex problem than for the VOCs because national survey data does notclearly define the extent of the contamination problem. In addition, EPAbelieves the occurrence potential for most contaminants is limited basedon previous survey data. For example, manufacture of PCBs was discontinuedin the U.S. in 1976. However, contamination potential still exists, primarilyfrom capacitors and transformers. There are many point and non-point sources of pesticide contamination.Point sources may include spills and leaks of pesticides at manufacturing,distribution, or storage facilities, or from hazardous and municipal wastelandfills and other waste handling of treatment facilities. The use ofpesticides to control insect and weed pests on agricultural areas, forestlands, home and gardens, and other land applications contribute to non-pointsources pollution of drinking water sources. Pesticide contamination, largelydue to sanctioned pesticide use in agricultural areas, most likely affectssmall systems. In addition, a single analytical method does not exist toanalyze all the pesticides. Rather, a minimum of four separate analyticalmethods must be used to analyze all the pesticides/PCBs included in today'snotice. EPA estimates each analytical method costs $200 per sample analyzed.In order to ensure that monitoring costs are reasonable, the proposed requirementstarget compliance monitoring to community and non-transient, non-communitywater systems which are vulnerable to contamination. Because local pesticideuse and the existence of capacitors and transformers are the primary factorsin determining vulnerability, EPA believes that the States are in the bestposition to assess a system's vulnerability. Appendix B of this noticeprovides guidance on the factors which may influence the vulnerabilityof systems to contamination by pesticides/PCBs. EPA considered three options related to the specific monitoring requirementsfor pesticides and PCBs. The options were: Option andplusmin;1: Monitoringrequirements should only apply to vulnerable systems; Option andplusmin;2:EPA would require all systems to conduct one round of monitoring unlessthe State waives the requirement on a case-by-case basis; and Option andplusmin;3:Vulnerable ground water systems would take a minimum of a single quarterlysample during the period of highest vulnerability; surface water systemswould take four quarterly samples. Under Option 3, if groundwater systemsdetected no contaminants in the initial sample, additional monitoring wouldnot be required. If systems do not detect contamination at the period ofhighest vulnerability, it may be unlikely that future contamination wouldbe detected. However, EPA asks for comment on the ability of the Stateto reliably estimate the period of highest vulnerability. Today's proposal proposes Option andplusmin;1 (only vulnerable systems arerequired to monitor for pesticides and PCBs for four quarters). EPA believesthis option provides the greatest opportunity for States to target monitoringto those areas where problems are likely to occur. Public comment is requestedon the chosen option and the other two options presented above. The proposed monitoring requirements described below for the pesticidesand PCBs are similar to those for VOCs, with a few exceptions as follows:(1) Systems must monitor only for those contaminants to which they arevulnerable; (2) sampling must occur during periods when contamination ismost likely to occur (e.g., after first rainfall during application seasonfor pesticides for surface water sources); and (3) the repeat monitoringrequirements are not as stringent for small systems (i.e., andgreater;500connections) because the pesticide/PCB monitoring costs are higher. Thesecosts would impose a significant economic burden on small systems. The proposed monitoring requirements to determine compliance with the MCLsfor the Group B organics (i.e., pesticides and PCBs) are: andbullet; Monitoring will be phased in over four years. Vulnerable systems(as determined by the State) must monitor at least quarterly for one yearduring the initial four years. andbullet; Each State will determine which systems are vulnerable within18 months after promulgation of the final rule after considering factorsthat influence vulnerability described in Appendix B. EPA will providegeneral procedures that the States may use to conduct vulnerability assessmentsof systems to contamination in a guidance document.andbullet; Systems which detect pesticides/PCBs remain vulnerable to thecontaminants detected for a minimum of three years. After three years theState can reclassify the system based upon a new assessment. andbullet; Vulnerable groundwater systems must take a minimum of one sampleat every entry point to the distribution system which is representativeof each well after treatment. For the initial round of monitoring, eachsystem must sample quarterly for one year. Repeat sampling frequenciesare based on system size and whether pesticides/PCBs are detected (seeTable 31). andbullet; The State may reduce the total number of samples by allowing useof composite samples from up to five entry points if the composite reflectsthe system's normal operating characteristics (i.e., if the composite isrepresentative of each well that is operating). If contamination is detectedin a composite sample follow-up sampling is required at each entry pointincluded in the composite. andbullet; Surface water systems must sample at points in the distributionsystem that are representative of each source or at each entry point tothe distribution system which is located after any treatment. For the initialround, each system must monitor quarterly for one year. EPA is proposingthat a surface water system may sample more frequently than quarterly.The rationale for allowing more frequent sampling for surface systems isthat monitoring results are more variable than for ground water systems.Because monitoring is required at periods of highest vulnerability, thefour quarterly samples may not reflect actual exposure. Surface water systemsmay at their option monitor more frequently as long as all samples takenare used to determine compliance and the sampling design chosen is representative.For example, a representative design is sampling on the same day of themonth or at consistent intervals between samples. EPA believes that additionalsampling will result in better estimates of the likelihood that the annualaverage exposure exceeds the MCL, especially when contamination levelsvary significantly. Repeat sampling frequencies are based on system sizeand whether pesticides/PCBs are detected (see Table 31).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,r15,r15 </C><T4>Table 31._Frequency of Repeat Monitoring Requirements for Pesticides/PCBs(Vulnerable Systems Only)  </T4><H1>Status </H1><H1>Ground water </H1><H1>Surface water</H1> SOCs are not detected \3\ <ITAG tagnum="2">Systems andgreater;500 connections <D>Repeat every 3 years </D><D>Repeat quarterly every 3 years \1\. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Systems andgreater;500 connections <D>Repeat every 5 years </D><D>Repeat quarterly every 5 years \1\. </D></ITAG>SOCs detected \2\ <ITAG tagnum="2">Systems andgreater;500 connections <D>Quarterly </D><D>Quarterly \3\. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Systems andgreater;500 connections <D>Annually </D><D>Annually \3\.  </D><F>\1\ Must sample for four consecutive quarters. </F><F>\2\ Detection=the MDL as defined in Table 14. </F><F>\3\ The number of samples required varies for ground and surface watersystems because of the likelihood of short term variability of contaminantconcentration in surface water sources.

This results in early notification of potentialhealth risks to consumers. In addition, if at any point during the samplingyear, it is clear the MCL would be exceeded, the system is out of complianceimmediately.</ITAG>Public comments are requested on all aspects of the proposed monitoringrequirements for inorganic, VOC, pesticide, and PCB contaminants. EPA specificallyrequests comments on the following issues: andbullet; Should the monitoring requirements apply only to vulnerable systemsor should all systems conduct at least one initial round of monitoring?andbullet; Are the sampling locations, number of samples per system and samplingfrequency adequate to measure drinking water quality? andbullet; Are the proposed requirements affordable by public water systems,especially small systems? andbullet; Is the active role of the States to determine each system's vulnerabilityand the repeat monitoring frequencies a reasonable expectation? andbullet; Should EPA require States to conduct periodic vulnerability assessments(i.e., every 3 or 5 years). andbullet; Whether systems which did not detect pesticides which were cancelled(Chlordane, PCBs, Silvex, Hepachlor, Toxaphene, EDB, DBCP) in the initialmonitoring round should be presumed to be reclassified as not vulnerable.Future monitoring would not be required unless the State reclassifies thesystem as vulnerable to the cancelled pesticides. andbullet; Whether systems are allowed to composite samples without Stateapproval. Under this scenario, systems or laboratories would decide whetherto composite rather than the State. However, because States may adopt regulationslimiting compositing which are more stringent than Federal requirements,States may limit compositing requirements as part of State regulations.EPA solicits comments on the problems and benefits compositing may provide.For example, certain contaminants such as PCBs and chlordane may adhereto sample bottles and could be missed if sampling techniques fail to obtaina representative sample. Is this a problem and are there techniques toovercome this limitation. Where technically feasible, compositing shouldreduce monitoring costs and will reduce demand on limited laboratory capacity.In addition to the proposed monitoring requirements, EPA is consideringan alternative monitoring scheme and may adopt it in the final rule. Underthis alternative, all community and non-transient, non-community publicwater systems would be required to monitor for asbestos and the pesticides/PCBsat the locations and the frequencies specified in andSection; 141.23 andandSection; 141.24, as appropriate. The States would not be required to conductvulnerability assessments to determine which systems would be requiredto monitor and at what intervals. Vulnerability assessments would be requiredonly when a system wished to decrease the monitoring required by andSection;141.23 and andSection; 141.24. If a system wished to decrease the monitoringrequirements, it would have to submit documentation to the State demonstratingthat the reduced monitoring frequencies were appropriate. The State wouldthen make a decision on the system's request based on the data the systemsubmitted and its own vulnerability assessment.The major difference between this alternative and EPA's proposal is thatthe alternative shifts the workload burden from the States to the publicwater systems; that is, the burden is on the system to monitor or to demonstrateto the State that its unique circumstances justify a change in the monitoringrequirements. (Under the current proposal, the burden is on the State tonotify the system that it is vulnerable and that it must monitor.) EPA solicits comments from all parties on this alternative approach. EPAis especially interested on the impact of this alternative on both thepublic water systems and on State programs.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Laboratory Approval </ITAG>EPA recognizes that the effectiveness of the proposed regulations is dependentupon the ability of laboratories to reliably analyze contaminants at relativelylow levels. The existing drinking water laboratory certification program(LCP) established by EPA requires that only approved laboratories may analyzecompliance samples. The LCP uses external checks of performance to evaluate a laboratory'sability to analyze samples for specific contaminants within specific limits.For this purpose, EPA provides performance evaluation (PE) samples to laboratorieson a regular basis; participation in this program is a prerequisite fora laboratory to achieve certification and to remain certified for analyzingcompliance samples. Achieving acceptable performance in these studies ofknown test samples provides some indication that the laboratory is followingproper practices. Unacceptable performance may be indicative of problemsthat could impact on the reliability of the compliance data. Unacceptable performance should trigger an investigation to establish thepossible cause(s) and to take corrective action. EPA recognizes that evena superior analytical laboratory occasionally produce data which is outsidethe acceptable limits due to statistical reasons rather than from any actualanalytical problems. A provision for rapid follow-up analysis is necessaryif a laboratory fails the initial determination to decrease the likelihoodof statistical error and to determine if a real problem exists. EPA's present PE sample program and the approaches used to determine laboratoryperformance requirements were discussed at 50 FR 46907 (November 13, 1985).Acceptable performance has historically been set by EPA using two differentapproaches: (1) regressions from performance of pre-selected laboratories,or (2) specified accuracy requirements. EPA requested public comment onthese approaches in the November 13, 1985 notice. Most commenters supportedthe use of a ``plus or minus percent of the true value'' approach to deriveacceptance limits instead of generating performance requirements from studystatistics. EPA agrees with these commenters and will specify accuracyrequirements in the revised regulations, whenever possible. This approachinvolves the specification of a ``plus or minus percent of the true value''for setting acceptance limits. The acceptance limits are derived from an evaluation of existing PE studydata. Under some circumstances, when there is insufficient informationto determine the expected performance for analytical laboratories becausethe analytical methods are new and the contaminants have not been includedin PE studies, EPA will determine the acceptance limits from individualstudy statistics based upon 95 percent confidence limits (refer to SectionIV for additional information). After sufficient performance data are generatedfrom PE studies, EPA will develop acceptance limits using a ``plus or minuspercent of the true value approach.'' A. Inorganic Chemicals EPA evaluated performance data gathered from past PE studies to set performancerequirements for the inorganics. Performance data are available for allthe inorganics with the exception of nitrite and asbestos. The availablePE data indicate that both the precision and the accuracy attained forspecific inorganic contaminants are contaminant-specific. For example,the percent recoveries are between 93 and 100 percent, while the relativestandard deviations are between 4 and 14 percent for the inorganics inthis proposal. The ``plus or minus percent of the true value'' acceptancelimits have been derived for each contaminant taking into considerationthe expected precision and accuracy and using 95 percent confidence limitsto estimate the acceptance limits. For example, the percent recovery forchromium is 100 percent and the relative standard deviation is 7 percent.The acceptance limits using 95 percent confidence limits would be 100%andplusmin;2(7%) or 86 to 114% of the ``true value.'' Thus, a andplusmin;15%of the ``true value'' acceptance limit is approximately equal to the 95%confidence limits. The acceptance limits for the other inorganics wereestimated using a similar approach. The acceptance limits for nitrite willbe the same as for nitrate for the reasons discussed earlier (i.e., theanalytical procedures used for nitrite determination and the MDLs are similarto nitrate). The acceptance limits only apply to concentrations andCx.170;PQL.The reader should note that fluoride acceptance limits are also proposedin this proposal since they were not previously established. The acceptance limits are summarized below: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,xs48,r25</C>  <H1>Contaminant</H1><H1>Acceptance limits</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Asbestos<D>Two standard deviations based on study statistics. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium<D/>andplusmin;15 percent at andCx.170;.15 mg/l. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D/>andplusmin;20 percent at andCx.170;.002 mg/l. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium<D/>andplusmin;15 percent at andCx.170;.01 mg/l. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fluoride<D/>andplusmin;10 percent at 1 to 10 mg/l. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury<D/>andplusmin;30 percent at andCx.170;.0005 mg/l. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrate<D/>andplusmin;10 percent at andCx.170;.4 mg/l. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrite<D/>andplusmin;10 percent at andCx.170;.4 mg/l </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium<D/>andplusmin;20 percent at andCx.170;.01 mg/l.</ITAG></ITAG> Public comments are requested on the acceptance limits for the inorganics.B. Synthetic Organic Chemicals <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Volatile Synthetic Organic Chemicals </ITAG>The proposed performance requirements are the same as the performance requirementsestablished for the 8 VOCs promulgated July 8, 1987 since laboratory performancefor the VOCs was similar. Laboratory studies show that approximately 85-90%of the EPA and State laboratories will be within andplusmin;40% of the truevalue for concentrations less than 10 andCx.18;g/l and within andplusmin;20%of the true value for levels above 10 andCx.18;g/l. Therefore, the acceptancelimits for the VOCs are andplusmin;20% of the true value for concentrationsof 10 andCx.18;g/l or above and andplusmin;40% of the true value for concentrationsbelow 10 andCx.18;g/l. Public comments are requested on the proposed acceptance limits for theVOCs. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Pesticides and PCBs </ITAG>There are no performance evaluation study data for these contaminants atthe present time because the analytical methods were only recently developed.Therefore, specified accuracy requirements for laboratory performance cannotbe established until more information is available on the actual performanceof these methods at different analytical laboratories. In the interim,acceptable performance for laboratory certification for these contaminantswill be based on acceptance limits generated from individual study statisticsusing two standard deviations (i.e., 95 percent confidence limits usingstudy statistics). EPA will collect performance data from future PE studiesand then develop accuracy requirements of laboratory performance basedon a plus or minus percent of the true value.Public comments are requested on the use of two standard deviations (i.e.,confidence intervals generated from individual study statistics) to determineacceptance limits for the pesticides and PCBs in this proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Monitoring for Unregulated Contaminants </ITAG>Requirements are proposed in this notice to monitor for other ``unregulated''contaminants. ``Unregulated contaminants'' are those contaminants for whichEPA establishes a monitoring requirement but the contaminant does not havean associated MCLG and MCL or treatment technique. The discussion belowdescribes the statutory authority, provides background information, anddescribes the proposed requirements. A. Statutory Authority The establishment of monitoring regulations is authorized by section 1445(a)(1)of the SDWA which states:<ITAG tagnum="21">Every person who is a supplier of water, * * * shall establish andmaintain such records, make such reports, conduct such monitoring, andprovide such information as the Administrator may reasonably require byregulation to assist him in establishing regulations, * * * in evaluatingthe health risks of unregulated contaminants or in advising the publicof such risks.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Further, section 1445(a)(2) of the SDWA require the EPA to promulgatemonitoring requirements for unregulated contaminants:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * The Administrator shall promulgate regulations requiring everypublic water system to conduct a monitoring program for unregulated contaminants.The regulations shall require monitoring of drinking water supplied bythe system and shall vary the frequency and schedule of monitoring requirementsfor systems based on the number of persons served by the system, the sourceof supply, and the contaminants likely to be found. Each system shall berequired to monitor at least once every 5 years after the effective dateof the Administrator's regulations unless the Administrator requires morefrequent monitoring.</ITAG>EPA fulfilled the statutory mandate contained in section 1445 (c)(2) ofthe Act by promulgating regulations establishing monitoring requirementsfor unregulated contaminants on July 8, 1987 (52 FR 2590). EPA is proposingadditional monitoring requirements pursuant to section 1445 (a)(1) to assistthe Agency in establishing future NPDWRS. B. Background In recent years, numerous chemical contaminants have been found in drinkingwater. Assessment of the quality of drinking water in the U.S. has beenaccomplished through various monitoring activities including: (1) Compliancemonitoring for the primary and secondary Federal drinking water standards,(2) compliance monitoring for certain State developed drinking water standards,(3) EPA conducted national statistically designed surveys of selected drinkingwater supplies, (4) State surveys, (5) responses to contamination incidents,and (6) research studies. These monitoring activities can determine in part the quality of the nation'sdrinking water. However, most small (and many large) public water systemsare unaware of possible contamination of their supplies. Except for certainlarge systems and those systems in a few States with aggressive monitoringprograms, very little ongoing monitoring occurs of potential contaminantsnot yet regulated in drinking water. Consequently, EPA believes that asystematic and comprehensive monitoring program is needed to determinethe quality of water delivered by public water systems. This program wouldenhance public awareness of drinking water, quality encourage control actions,when appropriate, before standards are implemented, and provide data usefulin developing regulations in the future. EPA recognized the need for a national monitoring program several yearsago. In 1984, EPA sponsored a public workshop to discuss the need to monitorunregulated drinking water contaminants. State, utility, public interestgroup, analytical laboratory, and individual consultant representativesattended the workshop. The workshop split all organic chemicals that wereconsidered to be potential drinking water contaminants into two groups:VOCs and pesticides and other higher molecular weight synthetic organicchemicals. The workshop participants recommended that: andbullet; EPA should initially develop monitoring regulations for unregulatedVOCs for all community water systems. andbullet; EPA should next developmonitoring regulations for a limited number of pesticides/SOCs which havesufficient information on occurrence and system vulnerability and for whichanalytical methods are available. Pesticide/ SOC monitoring should be directedat those Contaminants most likely to occur. andbullet; Before additional pesticide monitoring requirements are established,EPA should develop additional analytical methods and derive informationon system vulnerability. andbullet; States should have flexibility to design monitoring programs whichreflect regional priorities and concerns. The National Drinking Water Advisory Council (NDWAC) also considered thisissue in 1984 and recommended that EPA develop monitoring regulations fora limited number of pesticides for which analytical capabilities exist.Since the 1984 Workshop, EPA promulgated monitoring regulations for 50unregulated VOCs on July 8, 1987 (52 FR 25709). In order to establish MCLsfor pesticides and PCBs, EPA recently developed analytical methods to analyzethese contaminants. A residual benefit of the new methods is that theywill also detect other chemicals which occur in drinking water. C. Summary of Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Requirements EPA proposes monitoring requirements for approximately 110 ``unregulated''organic chemical and 6 inorganic contaminants. These ``unregulated'' contaminantsare divided into two groups. The monitoring requirements for contaminantsin the first group only apply to those systems vulnerable to contaminationto the listed chemicals. States may require monitoring contaminants inthe second group based on local concerns and priorities. For the first list of 29 organic and inorganic contaminants, the Statemust conduct a vulnerability assessment for each contaminant. The vulnerabilityassessment will determine the specific contaminants which community andnon-transient, non-community systems must monitor based on factors suchas chemical use, hydrogeology, or other factors. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Selection of Chemicals </ITAG>Two factors were considered to select the specific contaminants for ``unregulatedcontaminant'' monitoring. First, EPA included those contaminants whichsection 1412 of the SDWA directs EPA to regulate and which are not coveredby this notice (the list of 83 contaminants). Since those contaminantswill be regulated by EPA in future rulemaking it is reasonable to havesystems begin monitoring for the contaminants. Analytical methods 505,507, 508, 515.1, and 531.1 can analyze over one hundred pesticides, includingall the organic contaminants included in this proposal. The second factorwas used to discriminate those pesticides of higher priority and certaininorganic chemicals, based on previous detection in drinking water. EPA believes that the monitoring requirements should focus on those chemicalsof greatest concern in drinking water. However, the Agency does not wantto rule out other chemicals that may pose an adverse health risk and thatcan be measured with little additional analytical effort. Therefore, theAgency proposes that the State conduct system specific vulnerability assessmentsfor 23 pesticides/SOCs and six inorganic contaminants. Systems must completemonitoring for these priority andplusmin;1 contaminants within four yearsof promulgation of the final rule. States may require systems to monitorfor the remaining 84 contaminants (priority andplusmin;2) at its discretion.All pesticides (except two) in the second priority list can be analyzedusing EPA Methods 507 and 508. The two priority groups of contaminants are listed in Tables 32 and 33.EPA requests comments on the specific contaminants and their priority listedin these tables. Readers should note that only vulnerable systems, as determinedby the State, need to monitor for priority contaminants listed in Table32. Monitoring for priority 2 contaminants is at State discretion. Thesecontaminants are listed in Table 33. Analysis for unregulated contaminants must be conducted in laboratoriescertified by the State or EPA. EPA will provide interim certification tothose laboratories that analyze performance evaluation samples within theacceptance limits established by the EPA using approved analytical methodology.The laboratory can use this interim certification until a full certificationprogram is completed. The acceptance limits for unregulated contaminantsin this proposal are based on two standard deviations (i.e., 95 percentconfidence limits based on study statistics).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>32._<T4>Unregulated Contaminants Monitoring for Priority andplusmin;1 Contaminants_VulnerableSystems \1\ </T4><H1>Contaminant </H1><H1>Method</H1> SOCs: <ITAG tagnum="2">Hexachlorobenzene <D>505, 508 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Dalapon <D>515.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Dinoseb <D>515.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Picloram <D>515.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Oxamyl (vydate) <D>531.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Simazine <D>505, 507 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Glyphosate <D>547 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Hexachlorocyopentadiene <D>505, 525 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">PAHs <D>550, 550.1, 525 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Phthalates <D>506, 525 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2,3,7,8-TCDD (Dioxin) <D>513 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Aldrin <D>505, 508 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Dieldrin <D>505, 508 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2,4-DB <D>515.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Dicamba <D>515.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2,4,5-T <D>515.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Carbaryl <D>531.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">3-Hydroxycarbofuran <D>531.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Methomyl <D>531.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Butachlor <D>505, 507 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Metolachlor <D>505, 507 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Propachlor <D>505, 507 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Metribuzin <D>507</D></ITAG>IOCs: <ITAG tagnum="2">Antimony <D>Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption;

Proposed Monitoring Requirements for Unregulated Contaminants </ITAG>The monitoring requirements for the unregulated SOCs and inorganics aresimilar to the monitoring requirements previously described for inorganicsand pesticides/PCBs compliance monitoring (See section VI of this proposal).The unregulated contaminant monitoring specifies the same sampling locationsand the same minimum number of samples which must be collected and analyzed.Monitoring for the 29 priority andplusmin;1 contaminants must be completedwithin four years of promulgation. EPA believes the proposed monitoring requirement for unregulated contaminantsgives the States flexibility to design a program that targets monitoringto those systems which are potentially vulnerable to contamination. Unlikethe monitoring requirements for the regulated pesticides/PCBs which specifyrepeat frequencies, monitoring for unregulated contaminants involves onlyone round of monitoring. For the unregulated contaminants, though not required,EPA recommends that systems perform confirmatory analyses and that Statesfollow up any detected contamination to determine the precise nature ofthe problem. The proposed community and non-transient, non-community monitoring requirementsfor the unregulated SOCs are as follows:andbullet; For the priority andplusmin;1 contaminants, states must determinewhich systems are vulnerable to the contaminants list in Table 32. Monitoringfor the contaminants listed in Table 33 is at State discretion. andbullet; For the inorganics, the vulnerability assessment considers potentialcontamination of the water source. For the SOCs, the assessment considersprevious results, the proximity to potential point and non-point sourcesof contamination, environmental persistence, how well the source is protected,and nitrate levels. EPA notes that systems are only required to monitorfor the specific contaminants to which the State determines they are vulnerableto. andbullet; For the priority andplusmin;1 contaminants, all vulnerable systemsmust monitor quarterly at each sampling point for one year over the four-yearmonitoring period. andbullet; Ground water systems must sample at each entry point to the distributionsystem which is located after treatment. Surface water systems must takea minimum of one sample at points in the distribution system that are representativeof each source or at each entry point to the distribution system and whichis representative of each source. andbullet; The State may reduce the total number of samples by the use ofcomposite samples of multiple entry points (up to five entry points persample) if the composite reflects operating characteristics. If contaminationis detected in a composite, follow-up sampling is required from each sampleincluded in the composite. andbullet; The State may require systems to take a confirmation sample. The proposed monitoring requirements for the IOCs are similar to the monitoringrequirements previously described for barium, cadmium, chromium, mercuryand selenium. Only one round (one sample) of monitoring is required forthe unregulated inorganics. The proposed monitoring requirements are asfollows: andbullet; The State shall determine which systems are vulnerable. All vulnerablesystems shall monitor once within the four-year monitoring period. andbullet; Systems must sample at entry points to the distribution systemfor groundwater systems. Surface water systems must sample at entry pointsto the distribution system or in the distribution system, at points representativeof each source or treatment plant. One sample at each sampling point isrequired. andbullet; The total number of samples may be reduced at the discretion ofthe State by the use of composite samples. Composite samples from fivesources are allowed. If contamination by one or more IOCs is detected,follow-up sampling at each sampling point included in the composite sampleis required. As with the proposed monitoring requirements for the regulated contaminants,EPA is considering an alternative monitoring scheme for the unregulatedcontaminants. EPA may adopt this alternative in the final rule. Under thisalternative, EPA would require all community and non-transient, non-communitywater systems to conduct one round of monitoring for the unregulated contaminantsas specified in andSection; 141.40(m) (organics) and andSection; 141.40(n)(inorganics). No vulnerability assessments would be required. The majordifference between the proposal and the alternative is that the alternativemonitoring scheme places the burden on the system to perform the monitoringas opposed to placing it on the State to perform an assessment to determinewhich systems must monitor. The State would have the discretion to exemptsystems from monitoring for one, several, or all of the unregulated contaminantsif system submitted documentation to the State showing that it was notvulnerable to contamination by the contaminant(s) for which it did notwish to monitor. The State would then make a determination based on thesystem's submission and its own assessment of the circumstances. EPA solicits comments from all parties on the alternative monitoring scheme.EPA is especially interested in the effects of the alternative on boththe water systems and on the State programs.Public comments are requested on the need for monitoring for unregulatedcontaminants specified in this notice and on specific aspects of the proposedrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. State Implementation </ITAG>The Safe Drinking Water Act provides that States may assume primary implementationand enforcement responsibilities. Fifty-four out of 57 jurisdictions haveapplied for and received primary enforcement responsibility (primacy) underthe Act. To implement the Federal regulations for drinking water contaminants,States must adopt their own regulations which are at least as stringentas the Federal regulations. This section of today's proposal describesthe regulations and other procedures/policies the States must adopt toimplement today's proposed rule. EPA has previously proposed to reviseexisting program implementation requirements of 40 CFR Part 142, August2, 1988 (53 FR 29194). To implement today's proposed rule, States will be required to adopt thefollowing regulatory requirements: when they are promulgated: andSection;141.23, Inorganic Chemical Sampling and Analytical Requirements; andSection;141.24, Organic Chemical Other than Total Trihalomethanes Sampling andAnalytical Requirements; andSection; 141.32, General Public Notice Requirements(i.e., mandatory health effects language to be included in public notificationof violations); andSection; 141.40, Special Monitoring for Inorganic andOrganic Chemicals; andSection; 141.61 (a) and (c), Maximum Contaminant Levelsfor Organic Contaminants; andSection; 141.62, Maximum Contaminant Levelsfor Inorganic Chemicals; and andSection; 141.111, Treatment Techniques forAcrylamide and Epichlorohydrin.In addition to adopting drinking water regulations no less stringent thanthe federal regulations listed above, EPA is proposing that States adoptcertain requirements related to this regulation in order to have theirprogram revision application approved by EPA. In various respects the proposedNPDWRs provide flexibility to the State with regard to implementation ofthe monitoring requirements by this rule. Because State determinationsregarding vulnerability and monitoring frequency will have a substantialimpact with implementation of this regulation, the proposed rule requiresStates to submit as part of their State program submissions their policiesand procedures in these areas. This will serve to inform the regulatedcommunity of State requirements and also help EPA in its oversight of Stateprograms. These proposed requirements are discussed below under the sectionSpecial Primacy Requirements. Today, EPA is also proposing changes to State recordkeeping and reportingrequirements. EPA's proposed changes are discussed below. EPA requestscomments on these proposed requirements. A. Special State Primacy Requirements To ensure that the State program includes all the elements necessary foran effective and enforceable program, EPA proposes that, to obtain EPAapproval of program revisions, the State's request for approval must containthe following: (1) The procedures and/or policies the State will use to conduct vulnerabilityassessments. These procedures/policies must include the factors the Statewill use in conducting vulnerability assessments and the methods the Statewill use to inform each system of its vulnerability classification. Theprocedures must also include procedures and factors to be followed forreclassifying systems with regard to their vulnerability. (2) The procedures/policies the State will use to allow a system to decreaseits monitoring frequency. The policies/procedures must include the factorsa State will use in making this determination as well as the method theState will use to inform the system of its new required monitoring frequency.B. State Recordkeeping Requirements The current regulations in andSection; 142.14 require States with primaryenforcement responsibility to keep records of analytical results to determinecompliance, system inventories, sanitary surveys, State approvals, enforcementactions, and the issuance of variances and exemptions. States must keeprecords for forty years. In this proposal EPA would require that Stateskeep additional records of: (1) System vulnerability determinations and the basis for the determination.(2) Any determinations that a system may decrease the repeat monitoringfrequency for the inorganic chemicals and pesticides/PCBs. The recordsmust include the basis for the decision and the new monitoring frequency.(3) Any determinations that a system is required to conduct repeat monitoringfor asbestos when the initial analytical result is andless;50% of the MCL,the basis for the decision, and the repeat monitoring frequency. (4) Decisions that systems must monitor for the unregulated contaminants.(5) Letters received from systems serving less than 150 service connectionsstating that the system is available for sampling for the ``unregulatedcontaminants.'' (6) Annual certifications received from systems that when acrylamide andepichlorohydrin are used in drinking water systems that the combinationof dose and monomer levels do not exceed the specified levels. Since the above determination and information will determine the monitoringrequirements applicable to a system and will indicate whether a systemis complying with the treatment technique requirement in the proposed rule.EPA believes that the additional State recordkeeping requirements are necessaryfor effective EPA oversight of State primacy programs. EPA request publiccomments on these proposed requirements. EPA is also soliciting commentson the existing 40 year State recordkeeping requirement. EPA desires commenton whether this requirement should be modified. C. State Reporting Requirements EPA currently requires in andSection; 141.15 that States report to EPA informationsuch as violations, variances and exemption status, enforcement actions,etc. EPA proposes in this notice that in addition to the current reportingrequirements, States report to EPA: (1) A list of all systems on which the State conducted a vulnerabilityassessment, the results of that assessment, and the basis for the determination.(2) A list of all systems for which the State reduced the monitoring frequency,the new required monitoring frequency, and the basis for the State's decision.(3) A list of all systems which the State determines must conduct repeatmonitoring for asbestos. (4) The results of any monitoring for the ``unregulated contaminants''listed in andSection; 141.40 (m), (n), and (o). (5) A list of all systems serving less than 150 service connections whichduring the previous quarter sent a letter to the State stating its availabilityfor sampling for the ``unregulated contaminants.''(6) A list of those systems which certified compliance with the treatmenttechnique requirements for epichlorohydrin and acrylamide. EPA believes that the State reporting requirements contained in this proposalare necessary to ensure effective oversight of State programs. Public commentson these proposed State reporting requirements are requested. EPA particularlyrequests comments from States on whether the proposed reporting requirementsare reasonable. <ITAG tagnum="84">X. System Reporting Requirements </ITAG>The current regulations, 40 CFR 141.31, require public water systems toreport monitoring data to States within ten days after the end of the complianceperiod. No changes are proposed to those requirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">XI. State Wellhead Protection Programs </ITAG>Section 1428 of the SDWA contains requirements for the development andimplementation of State WHP Programs and authority for Federal grants.Specifically, subsections 1428 (a) and (b) provides that each State, includingthe District of Columbia and the eligible territories, shall adopt andsubmit to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a WHP Program that,at a minimum: 1. Specifies the duties of State agencies, local governmental entitiesand public water supply systems with respect to the development and implementationof Programs. 2. For each wellhead, determines the wellhead protection area (WHPA) asdefined in subsection 1428(e) based on all reasonably available hydrogeologicinformation on ground water flow, recharge and discharge and other informationthe State deems necessary to adequately determine the WHPA. 3. Identifies within each WHPA all potential anthropogenic sources of contaminantswhich may have any adverse effect on the health of persons. 4. Describes a Program that contains, as appropriate, technical assistance,financial assistance, implementation of control measures, education, trainingand demonstration projects to protect the water supply within WHPAs fromsuch contaminants. 5. Includes contingency plans for the location and provision of alternatedrinking water supplies for each public water system in the event of wellor wellfield contamination by such contaminants. 6. Includes a requirement that consideration be given to all potentialsources of such contaminants within the expected wellhead area of a newwater well which serves a public water supply system. 7. Includes a requirement for public participation. Guidance on the content of State Wellhead Protection Programs and the delineationof State Wellhead Protection areas are available from EPA's Office of Groundwater.EPA believes it can reduce the regulatory burden of the State and publicwater systems by linking similar program requirements of the WHP programand the Public Water Supply System program under the Safe Drinking WaterAct. Specifically, the 1986 Amendments to the SDWA establish a new WellheadProtection Program (WHP) to protect ground waters that supply wells andwellfields contributing drinking water to public water supply systems.The Program offers an innovative approach to ground water protection. Unlikemost other environmental programs, the WHP Program focuses on the entireresource requiring protection, rather than on a limited set of sourcesof contamination. The WHP Program, furthermore, focuses on a very importantsubset of ground water resources; that is, specific areas that supply wellsor wellfields withdrawing drinking water for public systems. This focuson public water systems will protect approximately 90 percent of the totalamount of ground water used for drinking in the United States. The managementof contamination risks to these wells through the WHP Program, therefore,provides the basis for significant gains in human health protection ina focused, effective manner. Section 1428 of the 1986 SDWA Amendments addresses areas vulnerable toground water contamination in defining a ``wellhead protection area.''The Act defines a ``wellhead protection area'' as ``the surface and subsurfacearea surrounding a water well or wellfield, supplying a public water system,through which contaminants are reasonably likely to move toward and reachsuch water well or wellfield'' (section 1428(e)). Thus, such a water wellor wellfield may be vulnerable to contamination because the nature of thesurface or subsurface area (i.e., the geology of the area) and the activitiesin the area are reasonably likely to allow contamination to reach the wellor wellfield. A major factor in reducing vulnerability is a program ofmanagement controls for existing and potential sources of contamination.A State Wellhead Protection Program will also include: (1) Contingencyplans to respond to contamination of ground water and (2) considerationof sources of contamination in siting new wells. The management of existingand potential sources of contamination, contingency plans, and new wellsiting is expanded to reduce the vulnerability of public water supply wells.EPA's Office of Drinking Water is currently in the process of developingguidance on how to evaluate and assess contamination potential which mayaffect drinking water sources. This guidance will discuss how the assessmentsconducted under State Wellhead Programs and Drinking Water Programs shouldbe linked. At this time, EPA is inviting public comment on linking certain requirementsof the Wellhead Protection Program and the Public Water Supply System Program.Specifically, EPA would like comment on whether the WHP assessment of sourcesof contamination could be used for the vulnerability assessment of thisproposed rule in determining monitoring frequency of public water supplysystems, and what the relationship of the two assessments should be.<ITAG tagnum="84">XII. Public Notice Requirements </ITAG>Under Section 1414(c)(1) of the Act, each owner or operator of a publicwater system must give notice to persons served by it of (1) any violationof any MCL, treatment technique requirement, or testing provision prescribedby an NPDWR; (2) failure to comply with any monitoring requirement undersection 1445(a) of the Act; (3) existence of a variance or exemption; and(4) failure to comply with the requirements of a schedule prescribed pursuantto a variance or exemption. The 1986 amendments require that within 15months of enactment, EPA amend its current public notification regulationsto provide for different types and frequencies of notice based on the differencesbetween violations which are intermittent or infrequent and violationswhich are continuous or frequent, taking into account the seriousness ofany potential adverse health effects which may be involved. EPA promulgated regulations to revise the public notification requirementson October 28, 1987 (52 FR 41534). The regulations state that violationsof an MCL, treatment technique or variance or exemption schedule (``Tier1 violations'') contain health effects language specified by EPA whichconcisely and in non-technical terms conveys to the public the adversehealth effects that may occur as a result of the violation. States andwater utilities remain free to add additional information to each notice,as deemed appropriate for specific situations. This proposed rule containsspecific health effects language for the contaminants which are in today'sproposed rulemaking. EPA believes that the mandatory health effects languageis the most appropriate way to inform the affected public of the healthimplications of violating a particular EPA standard. The proposed mandatoryhealth effects language in andSection; 141.32(e) describes in non-technicalterms the health effects associated with the proposed contaminants. Publiccomment is requested on the proposed language.  <ITAG tagnum="84">XIII. Regulatory Impact Analysis </ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires EPA and other regulatory agencies to performa regulatory impact analysis (RIA) for all ``major'' regulations, whichare defined as those regulations which impose an annual cost to the economyof $100 million or more, or meet other criteria. The Agency has determinedthat the proposed rule is a major rule for purposes of the Executive Order.This regulation has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budgetas required by the Executive Order and their comments are available inthe public docket. In accordance with the Executive Order, the Agency has conducted an assessmentof the benefits and costs of regulatory alternatives (see ``RegulatoryImpact Analysis of Proposed Inorganic Chemical Regulations,'' March 31,1989, and ``Regulatory Impact Analysis of Proposed Synthetic Organic ChemicalRegulations,'' April, 1989). The purpose of the assessment was to determineoverall impacts of the proposed regulation. Table 34 shows results from the regulatory impact analyses. Approximately2,475 community and non-transient, non-community water systems would beexpected to exceed the final standards for SOCs and IOCs without additionaltreatment. If these systems took actions to comply with the regulations,the annual costs to the nation would be $88 million.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,6,4 </C><T4>Table 34._National Costs and Benefits of Phase II Contaminants </T4><H1>  </H1><H1>SOCs </H1><H1>IOCs</H1> Central treatment: \1\ <ITAG tagnum="2">Capital costs ($M) <D>288 </D><D>73 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Annualized capital ($M/yr.) \1\ <D>19 </D><D>5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Operating and maintenance costs ($M/yr.) <D>12 </D><D>6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Annualized monitoring costs ($M/yr.) \2\ <D>\3\ 30 </D><D>\3\ 2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">State implementation cost <D>14 </D><D>(\4\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total annual costs ($M/yr.) <D>75 </D><D>13 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of systems impacted <D>2,283 </D><D>192 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cancer cases avoided <D>72 </D><D>(\5\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Population exposed (millions) <D>1.7 </D><D>0.6 </D></ITAG>Cost per household per year ($/hh/yr.) for treatment <ITAG tagnum="2">Small <D>125 </D><D>461 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Medium <D>40 </D><D>126 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Large <D>20 </D><D>72 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Very large <D>10 </D><D>0  </D><F>\1\ Includes waste disposal costs. </F><F>\2\ Annualized at 3% over 20 years. </F><F>\3\ Includes the one-time costs for compliance with monitoring requirementsfor unregulated contaminants. </F><F>\4\ Included within SOCs. </F><F>\5\ Because dose/response functions for the sublethal health effectsare not available, cancer cases avoided could not be calculated.</F></ITAG></ITAG>The cost impacts on water systems and consumers affected by most of thesynthetic organic and inorganic contaminants are small and vary dependingupon the specific chemical contaminant and the size of the public watersystem. Households served by large to very large water systems (those servingmore than 3,300 people) could be subject to water bill increases of between$20 and $72 per year, if their systems had SOC or IOC contamination greaterthan the proposed MCLs. EPA believes that these costs are affordable. Smallsystems, those serving fewer than 500 people, incur higher per householdcosts because they do not benefit from engineering economies of scale.Households served by these small systems would have to pay significantlymore, should their system have SOC or IOC contamination greater than theproposed MCL. In the case of SOCs, typical annual water bills could increaseby as much as $125, which EPA believes is an affordable level. In the caseof IOCs, however, water bills in small supplies could climb an additional$461 per year in contaminated systems. As discussed in Section V, above,EPA is soliciting comment on whether these costs for small systems areaffordable in order to determine BAT for small systems under section 1415of the Act for the purpose of issuing variances. A. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires EPA to consider the effect of regulationson small entities, 5 U.S.C. 602 <T3>et seq. </T3>If there is a significant effect on a substantial numberof small systems, the Agency must prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysiswhich describes significant alternatives which would minimize the impacton small entities. The Administrator has determined that the proposed rule,if promulgated, will not have a significant effect on a substantial numberof small entities. Using the Small Business Administration's definition,a small water utility is one that serves fewer than 50,000 people. Thereare about 78,000 such systems. Of these, fewer than 200 are likely to havecontamination levels greater than the inorganics' MCLs and fewer than 2,300are likely to have contamination in excess of the organic contaminants'MCLs. Therefore, this rule will affect less than one percent of small systemsunder inorganic MCLs and about 2.9 percent of small systems under the SOCMCLs, which EPA believes does not constitute a substantial number of smallsystems. It is possible that today's action will have a significant impacton a few small systems if SOCs and IOCs are found at levels higher thanthe MCLs. Even though this rule is not subject to the requirements of the Act, theAgency is concerned about potential impacts on small systems and the proposedrule, in many respects, seeks to mitigate that impact. Specifically, theproposed rule allows compositing of samples in order to reduce analyticalcosts. Also, the Agency has allowed bottled water and point-of-use devicesas conditions of receiving a variance or exemption to accommodate the needsof smaller systems with limited resources. The Agency has also given theStates the discretion to reduce monitoring frequency in accordance witha system's findings of no SOCs or IOCs and its vulnerability status. Consequently,smaller systems which do not have IOC or SOC contamination in their watersupply and are not located in a vulnerable area may have to monitor onlyinfrequently. EPA has also sought to reduce the burden of compliance monitoringby allowing smaller systems more time to complete the initial round ofmonitoring for VOCs in the proposed rule, and by requiring less frequentmonitoring for SOCs for the smallest size systems. B. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this rule have been submittedfor approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the PaperworkReduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The information collection requirementsare not effective until OMB approves them and a technical amendment tothat effect is published in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4><ITAG tagnum="84">XIV. Secondary MCLs (SMCLs) </ITAG>EPA is proposing SMCLs in this notice based upon taste or odor detectionlevels for seven organic chemicals. (For five chemicals for which SMCLsare proposed, EPA also is proposing MCLGs/MCLs in this notice). The MCL/MCLGsfor an additional SMCL,  p-dichlorobenzene, was promulgated in the July8, 1987 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. Seven of these organic chemicals havereported taste or odor detection levels lower than the proposed (or final)MCLs. EPA believes that it is appropriate to set SMCLs for these compoundsto protect against aesthetic effects (such as odor) which could be presentat levels below the proposed MCLs. SMCLs are also proposed for two inorganic contaminants, silver and aluminumbased on cosmetic and/or aesthetic effects. These contaminants were originallycontained in the list of 83 contaminants which were to be regulated byJune 19, 1989. However, the Agency substituted other priority contaminantsfor silver and aluminum (see 53 FR 1892, January 22, 1988). EPA believes that the nine SMCL contaminants may adversely affect the appearanceor odor of drinking water and thereby may cause a substantial number ofpersons served by the public water system to discontinue their use of itsdrinking water, or may otherwise affect the public welfare.For the other chemicals in this notice, EPA would like to develop SMCLsin order to inform the public about expected aesthetic effects (primarilytaste and odor) from exposure to a contaminant. However, information ontaste or odor detection levels was not available in the literature. EPAasks that any information that may be available on taste or odor detectionlevels for these chemicals be submitted to the Agency. EPA also plans tocarry out studies on taste and odor detection levels for those chemicalsfor which information is not available in order that SMCLs may be proposedin the future. EPA determined the SMCLs by evaluating the literature for taste and odordetection levels and, if more than one threshold level was available, usingthe most conservative (i.e., the lowest) value for that chemical. Literatureevaluations included laboratory determinations of taste and odor and thresholdsin water dilution calculated from air odor thresholds (a situation whichcould represent detection of odors in bathing or showering). The followingis a summary of the proposed SMCLs: A. Aluminum Proposed SMCL of 0.05 mg/l based upon a level recommended by the AmericanWater Works Association (AWWA) to prevent post-treatment precipitationin the distribution system.B. o-Dichlorobenzene Proposed SMCL of 0.01 mg/l, based upon the odor detection level as reportedby Kolle, W., K.H. Schweer, N. Gusten and L. Stieglitz (1972). Reference:Identifizierung schwer abbaubaren Schadstoffen in Rhein and RheinuferfiltratVom Wasser, 39, 109-119. (In:<T3> Compilation of Odour Threshold Values in Air and Water</T3>, Circa1978, Editors, van Gemert, L.J., and A.H. Nettenbreijer, National Instituteof Water Supply, Voorburg, Netherlands.) C. p-Dichlorobenzene Proposed SMCL of 0.005 mg/l. The odor detection level as reported by Grunt,F.E.De. (1975) is 0.003 mg/l. Reference: Unpublished data_National Institutefor Water Supply, Voorburg, Netherlands. (In:<T3> Compilation of Odour Threshold Values in Air and Water</T3>, Circa1978, Editors, van Gemert, L.J., and A.H. Nettenbreijer, National Instituteof Water Supply, Voorburg, Netherlands.)

Silver EPA proposes a SMCL of 0.09 mg/l, based upon argyria as a cosmetic effect.The SMCL was determined based upon several clinical reports in which humansdeveloped argyria as a result of i.v. and oral exposure to silver (Gauland Staud.

This MCLwas established in 1975, as part of the National Interim Primary DrinkingWater Regulations. EPA examined the available data on silver and did notpropose an RMCL for this compound on November 13, 1985 due to the factthat the only adverse effect from exposure to silver is argyria (a discolorationof the skin). EPA considers argyria a cosmetic effect since it does notimpair the functioning of the body or present other physiological problems.The SDWA Amendments of 1986 require EPA to regulate 83 contaminants indrinking water by 1989. The SDWA allows EPA to substitute up to seven contaminantsif regulation of the substitutes is more likely to be protective of publichealth. EPA has substituted silver from the list of 83 contaminants forregulation (53 FR 1892). Since the effects associated with ingestion ofsilver are not considered adverse and silver is seldom found at significantlevels in water supplies, EPA substituted silver out of the list of 83contaminants. EPA is proposing to delete the current MCL for silver, since the effectsof ingesting the contaminant are solely cosmetic and not adverse withinthe meaning of the SDWA. As noted above, EPA is proposing an SMCL for silverbased on cosmetic effects. EPA requests public comment on the removal ofthe silver MCL. <ITAG tagnum="84">XV.

Recent monitoring efforts by someStates indicate that the number of pesticides found in ground water issignificant enough to cause concern. However most pesticides are generallyfound at low levels. Most of the available monitoring data is the resultof studies conducted in ``hot-spot'' areas or in wells not used for drinkingwater consumption. Therefore, the available occurrence information is inadequateto make national projections of consumer exposure to pesticides via drinkingwater. Currently EPA is surveying public and private wells via a pesticidesurvey and may be able to use this data to determine national occurrenceat a later date. There are five general criteria that can be used to target those systemswhich appear to have the greatest vulnerability to pesticide contamination.These criteria can aid the States in the development and implementationof monitoring programs that would focus monitoring efforts on those systemsmost vulnerable to contamination by pesticides. These criteria are: (1) Available monitoring data on pesticides or other synthetic organiccompounds, (2) The nearby presence of potential sources of contamination, (3) Environmental persistence of the pesticide and mobility of the contaminant,(4) The hydrogeological conditions in the area, and (5) The finding of elevated nitrate levels in the water supply. The best indicator that a system is vulnerable to pesticide contaminationis prior, reliable occurrence data. The second criterion, nearby use, storageor disposal of pesticides, is an obvious indication of potential contamination,provided the pesticide can infiltrate the water supply. This phenomenonencompasses the third and fourth criteria, which depend on the environmentalpersistence of the contaminant and the vulnerability to infiltration ofthe water source. The latter is a complex function of the local climate,geology, and hydrology of the water source. The EPA has postulated the fifth criterion, elevated nitrate levels, asan indicator of pesticide infiltration. Since nitrates in water are anindication that fertilizer (man made or animal droppings) has leached intothe water source, it also indicates that environmentally stable, watertransported pesticides could contaminate the same source. It appears thatthere is a positive correlation between high nitrate levels and the presenceof other contaminants. Unfortunately, like many simple indicators, it onlyflags contaminated supplies. The absence of higher than normal nitratelevels does not seem to indicate that a supply is invulnerable or uncontaminated.However, EPA encourages authorities to consider this as a possible, facileway to select hot spots for more thorough pesticide screening. The first four criteria are discussed in more detail below. 1. Previous Findings The identification of contamination by pesticides or other synthetic organiccompounds during previous monitoring efforts suggests that the rechargearea is vulnerable. This occurs in locations where the recharge areas areclose to the land surface and thus may be affected by land management practicessuch as pesticide application. Water supplies are contaminated either througha transport of the chemicals through the soil to the ground water, or inthe case of surface waters, through surface run-off. Positive results arealways helpful in identifying areas conducive to chemical residue transport.2. Proximity to Sources of Contamination Pesticides may contaminate a vulnerable water source during their manufacture,distribution, storage, disposal, or use. They may be used on the land orin industrial settings. The sources of contamination may be grouped intotwo general categories based on the characteristics of the contamination:a. <T3>Point sources_</T3>include spills and leaks of pesticides at manufacturing,distribution or storage facilities, or from hazardous and municipal wastelandfills and other waste handling or treatment facilities where bulk pesticidesare disposed. There are a number of Federal and state laws that are aimedat the prevention and reporting of spills and leaks from these facilities.When an accident does occur, it is relatively localized and can be at leastpartially controlled. Reports of these incidents can aid in assessing thevulnerability of a supply. b. <T3>Non-point sources_</T3>include use of pesticides to control insectand weed pests on agricultural areas, forest lands, home and gardens, andother land application uses. The pesticides applied to the land may becarried by runoff waters into surface water or may enter ground water byinfiltration through the ground. For surface water systems, the proximity of the water sources to manufacturersand formulators increases the probability of contamination because of potentialdischarges into the surface water. The potential for contamination of thewater source also increases with the proximity to agricultural areas becauseof runoff of pesticides into surface water. Thus, a sanitary survey andan examination of upstream waste water discharges and agricultural activitiescan indicate the nature and extent of pollution activities that affectthe vulnerability of a surface water system. Some watersheds are protectedby strict access and land use laws. Surface water systems could be rankedaccording to the extent of watershed protection afforded by these landuse restrictions or the remoteness of the source to pesticide manufacturingor use activities.Table B-1 summarizes potential sources of contamination of ground watersources. States should determine the presence of manufacturing, commercial,or waste disposal facilities, or other potential point sources near therecharge areas. The presence of contamination from agricultural use orother land uses is more difficult to assess because such usage is oftenspread over a wide area at very low concentrations initially that may buildup over time with continued pesticide use. States may establish a hierarchy that would characterize regions accordingto whether they have high, medium, low or uncommon pesticide usage forland application uses. Specific information on use patterns may be obtainedfrom the agricultural commissioner or other local authorities. Also, regionalpesticide sales data and county level crop data are available. Table B-2summarizes the major current applications of selected pesticides. Thesetools can be used by States to set monitoring priorities for water systems.The use of 2,4,5-TP (Silvex) was cancelled in 1984. In addition, toxaphenewas apparently used only in cotton growing areas since 1984 when its usewas cancelled for most other crops. More recently, the use of chlordaneand heptachlor was cancelled in 1988. The use of EDB and DBCP has alsobeen severely restricted. Water supplies that do not detect the presenceof these contaminants during initial monitoring should not be requiredto conduct repeat monitoring. States may want to reclassify the vulnerabilityof the system based upon the initial monitoring results.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s50,8,6,6,6</C><T4>Table B-</T4>1._<T4>Potential Sources of Pesticide Contamination of Ground Water</T4><H1>   </H1><H1>Manufacturers/Formulators </H1><H1>Dealer </H1><H1>Industrial user </H1><H1>Land application</H1> Spills and Leaks <ITAG tagnum="2">Storage Areas <D>X </D><D>X </D><D>X </D><D>X </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Storage Tanks/Pipelines <D>X </D><D>X </D><D>X </D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Loading/Unloading <D>X </D><D>X </D><D>X </D><D>X </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Transport Accidents <D>X </D><D>X </D><D>X </D><D>X </D></ITAG>Disposal <ITAG tagnum="2">Process Waste <D>X </D><D> </D><D>X </D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Off-specification Material <D>X </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Cancelled Products <D>X </D><D>X </D><D>X </D><D>X </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Containers <D>X </D><D>X </D><D>X </D><D>X </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Rinsate <D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>X </D></ITAG>Land Application <ITAG tagnum="2">Leaching \1\ <D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>X </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Backflow to irrigation well <D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>X </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Run-in to wells, sinkholes <D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>X </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Mixing/loading areas <D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>X </D><F>\1\ Leaching potential affected by chemical-physical properties of pesticide,hydrogeologic setting, and application and cultivation practices. </F><F>Reference: Pesticides in Ground Water: Background Document U.S. EPA,Office of Ground Water Protection, May 1986.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>B-2._<T4>Current Applications of Selected Pesticides  </T4><H1>Pesticide </H1><H1>Applications \1\</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Alachlor<D>Corn; soybeans; peanuts. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aldicarb<D>White/sweet potatoes; cotton; peanuts; pecans (S.E.); citrus; sugarbeets; ornamentals; dry beans; sorghum; soybeans; sugarcane (La.). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbofuran<D>Sweet/field corn; sorghum; alfalfa; peanuts; soybeans; rice; grapes;cotton; sugarcane; tobacco; potatoes; grapes; small grains; cucurbits.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chlordane<D>Cancelled, 1988. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-D<D>Grasses; wheat; barley; oats; sorghum; corn; sugarcane. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">DBCP<D>Pineapples (Hawaii only). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichloropropane<D>Soil fumigant. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">EDB<D>Fumigation of exported fruit. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Heptachlor<D>Cancelled, 1988. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lindane<D>Seed and soil treatment; lumber dips; fruit and nut tree foliage application;vegetables; human scalp (lice); ornamentals; tobacco transplants. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methoxychlor<D>Dairy and beef cattle; home gardens; fruit and shade trees; vegetables.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol<D>Wood preservative. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4,5-TP (Silvex)<D>Cancelled, 1984. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toxaphene<D>Cotton; cancelled for other uses, 1984. </D><F>\1\ Berg, G.L., ed., Farm Chemicals Handbook, 1986.</F></ITAG></ITAG> In summary, the following information should be considered in the determinationof proximity of the water system to potential sources of contamination:a. Nearby manufacturing, distribution or storage facilities; b. Nearby hazardous and municipal waste landfills or other waste handlingor treatment facilities; c. Nearby land application uses, especially in crop growing areas; andd. Reports of spills or leaking storage areas. 3. Environmental Persistence In general, the ability of a pesticide to reach groundwater increases withits environmental persistence. Many organochlorine pesticides have beenbanned because of their long persistence in the environment. The disappearanceof a pesticide from soil can be the result of physical, chemical and biologicalprocesses. These processes include volatilization, hydrolysis, photolysisand microbial degradation. Degradation of pesticides can be expressed asfield dissipation half-lives or as persistence in soil (i.e., approximatetime for 90% disappearance from soil). The decomposition processes arein turn a function of the climate (humidity, temperature, rainfall) andthe soil type. The combination of pesticide degradation rates and the hydrogeologicalcharacteristics of the area determine whether the pesticide has the opportunityto contaminate the water source.4. Vulnerable Hydrogeology Certain hydrogeological characteristics influence the likelihood that apesticide will infiltrate through the soil and contaminate ground watersources. Hydrogeological factors such as type of soil, depth to water,and permeability of the aquifer formation can determine the vulnerabilityof a ground water source to pesticide contamination. There are variousapproaches that have been evaluated for modeling ground water vulnerabilityfrom the knowledge of hydrogeological parameters. One of these approaches,known by the acronym DRASTIC, combines information on seven different hydrogeologicalparameters to produce a score which is an indicator of relative groundwater contamination potential for a county or subcounty region. DRASTIC has been used by EPA to classify all the counties of the UnitedStates into three categories of ground water vulnerability (high, mediumor low) as part of the design of National Pesticide Survey. States mayuse DRASTIC or other approaches in combination with pesticide use datato determine those areas particularly vulnerable to pesticide contamination.Specific hydrogeologic considerations of DRASTIC are: a. <T3>Depth to water</T3>_it determines the thickness of the material throughwhich a contaminant must travel to reach the aquifer (shallow ground waterdepths are more vulnerable than deeper ground water depths). b. <T3>Recharge</T3>_amount of water per unit area of land that reaches thewater table (the greater the recharge, the easier it is for contaminationto occur). c. <T3>Aquifer media</T3>_geological materials that exert control over theroute and path length that a contaminant must follow (the larger the grainsize or porosity and the more fractures within the aquifer, the higherpermeability, and the greater the contamination potential). d. <T3>Soil type</T3>_it affects the amount of recharge that can infiltrateinto ground water and the ability of a contaminant to move vertically (highlypermeable soils increase contamination potential). e. <T3>Topography</T3>_it refers to the slope of the land surface (steep slopesare more conducive to high runoff capacity, rapid erosion and contaminationof surface waters and provide less probability of infiltration into groundwater). f. <T3>Vadose zone media</T3>_it refers to the water-saturated zone abovethe water table which controls the path-length and routing of contamination(similar to aquifer media). g. <T3>Hydraulic conductivity</T3>_it refers to the ability of the aquifermaterial to transmit pollutants throughout the aquifer. The source of water may be protected by natural factors such as the hydrogeologiccharacteristics described above, or regulatory discharge controls. However,other conditions may arise that could lead to contamination problems. Forexample, even geologically invulnerable formations can be polluted by improperwell construction or discharging into existing wells. Also, areas withcool, moist climates, where evaporation is low and rainfall is high arelikely to be conducive to pesticide transport to ground water, particularlywhere such conditions exist during or shortly after application. Irrigation practices may also facilitate contaminant movement. For surfacewater sources, a sanitary survey and an examination of upstream waste dischargersor agricultural runoff can indicate the extent of pollution activitiesthat affect the vulnerability of surface water systems. Contamination ofsurface water systems from agricultural runoff is influenced by the timingof rainfall events after application. The above criteria may be used by individual states to determine the vulnerabilityof public water systems to contamination by pesticides. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 141, 142 and 143 </ITAG>Chemicals, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Water supply, Administrativepractice and procedure.<ITAG tagnum="6">William K.

(5) The frequency of monitoring for barium, cadmium, chromium, fluoride,mercury, and selenium shall be in accordance with paragraph (c) of thissection, the frequency of monitoring for asbestos shall be in accordancewith paragraph (d) of this section; the frequency of monitoring for nitrateand nitrite shall be in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.(b) Monitoring conducted to determine compliance with the maximum contaminantlevel for asbestos specified in andSection; 141.62 shall be conducted asfollows: (1) No community or non-transient, non-community water system is requiredto monitor for asbestos unless the State determines the system is vulnerable,to asbestos contamination in its source water or due to corrosion of asbestos-cementpipe, or both. The State shall make this determination by [insert date18 months from publication of the final rule in the Federal Register],based on a consideration of the following factors: (i) Potential asbestos contamination of the water source, (ii) The use of asbestos-cement pipe for finished water distribution andthe corrosive nature of the water. (2) If the system is determined by the State in accordance with paragraph(b)(1) of this section to be vulnerable to asbestos contamination in itssource water, the system shall monitor in accordance with the provisionsof paragraph (a) of this section. (3) If the system is determined by the State in accordance with paragraph(b)(1) of this section to be vulnerable to asbestos contamination due tocorrosion of asbestos-cement pipe, the system shall take one sample ata tap served by asbestos-cement pipe and under conditions where asbestoscontamination is most likely to occur. (4) If the system is determined by the State in accordance with paragraph(b)(1) of this section to be vulnerable to asbestos contamination bothin its raw water supply and due to corrosion of asbestos-cement pipe, thesystem shall take one sample at a tap served by asbestos-cement pipe andunder conditions where asbestos contamination is most likely to occur.(5) Systems designated as vulnerable to asbestos contamination may be redesignatedby the State as not vulnerable based upon the results of initial monitoringand a revised assessment that it is not vulnerable to asbestos contamination.(c) The frequency of monitoring conducted to determine compliance withthe maximum contaminant levels in andSection;andSection; 141.11 or 141.62 (asappropriate) for barium, cadmium, chromium, fluoride, mercury, and seleniumshall be as follows: (1) Groundwater systems shall monitor once every three years and surfacewater systems shall monitor once every year. (2) The State may reduce the three year and one year monitoring frequenciesspecified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to no less than once everyten years provided that surface water systems have monitored annually forat least three years and that groundwater systems have conducted a minimumof three rounds of monitoring and all previous analytical results are andless;50percent of the maximum contaminant level. Systems that use a new watersource are not eligible for reduced monitoring until three rounds of monitoringfrom the new source have been completed. In determining the appropriatereduced monitoring frequency, the State shall consider: (i) Reported concentrations from all previous monitoring; (ii) The degree of variation in reported concentrations; and (iii) Other factors which may affect contaminant concentrations such aschanges in groundwater pumping rates, changes in the system's configuration,changes in the system's operating procedures, or changes in stream flowsor characteristics. (3) A decision by the State to reduce the monitoring frequency shall bemade in writing and shall set forth the basis for the determination. Thedetermination may be initiated by the State or upon an application by thepublic water system. The public water system shall specify the basis forits request. The State shall review and, where appropriate, revise itsdetermination of the appropriate monitoring frequency when the system submitsnew monitoring data or when other data relevant to the system's appropriatemonitoring frequency becomes available.(4) Each community water system shall complete the first round of monitoringrequired by paragraph (c)(1) of this section and report the results tothe State by [insert 18 months after publication of this final rule inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>]. (5) Each non-transient, non-community water system shall complete the firstround of monitoring required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section and reportthe results to the State by [insert four years after publication of thisfinal rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>]. (d) Each community and non-transient, non-community water system determinedby the State in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section to bevulnerable to asbestos contamination shall conduct one round of monitoringand report the results to the State by [insert five years from publicationof this final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>]. (1) For those systems where the level of asbestos in any sample in theinitial round of monitoring is &quot;50 percent of the MCL for asbestos, monitoringfor ground water systems shall be repeated every three years and monitoringfor surface water systems shall be repeated every year. (2) For those systems where the level of asbestos in each sample in theinitial round of monitoring is andgreater;50 percent of the MCL for asbestos,the State shall determine whether repeat monitoring is required and, ifso, the frequency of such monitoring. (e) Each community; non-transient, non-community; and transient, non-communitywater system shall monitor to determine compliance with the maximum contaminantlevel for nitrate in andSection; 141.11 or andSection; 141.62(b) (as appropriate)and for nitrite in andSection; 141.62(b). (1) Community and non-transient, non-community water systems served byground water systems shall monitor annually; systems served by surfacewater shall monitor quarterly. (2) For community and non-transient, non-community water systems, the repeatmonitoring frequency for ground water systems shall be quarterly for atleast one year following any one sample in which the concentration is &quot;50percent of the MCL. The State may allow a ground water system to reducethe sampling frequency to annually after four consecutive quarterly samplesare andless;50 percent of the MCL. (3) For community and non-transient, non-community water systems, the Statemay allow a surface water system to reduce the sampling frequency to annuallyif all analytical results from four consecutive quarters are andgreater;50percent of the MCL. A surface water system shall return to quarterly monitoringif any one sample is &quot;50 percent of the MCL. (4) Each transient non-community water system served by groundwater shallmonitor for nitrate and nitrite every three years. Each non-community watersystem served by surface water shall monitor for nitrate and nitrite annually.(5) Each sample must be taken at the time of highest vulnerability to nitrate/nitritecontamination (i.e., after rain and/or application of fertilizer). (6) Each community water system shall complete the initial monitoring requiredby paragraph (e)(1) of this section (as appropriate) and report the resultsto the State by [insert 18 months after publication of this final rulein the <T4>Federal Register</T4>]. (7) Each non-transient, non-community water system shall complete the initialmonitoring required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section and report theresults to the State by [insert 4 years after publication of this finalrule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>]. (8) Each transient non-community water system shall complete the initialmonitoring required by paragraph (e)(4) of this section and report theresults to the State by [insert 4 years after publication of this finalrule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>]. (f) Confirmation samples:(1) Where the results of sampling for asbestos, barium, cadmium, chromium,fluoride mercury, or selenium indicate an exceedance of the maximum contaminantlevel, the State may require that one additional sample be collected assoon as possible after the initial sample was taken (but not to exceedtwo weeks) at the same sampling point. (2) Where nitrate or nitrite sampling results indicate an exceedance ofthe maximum contaminant level, the system shall take a confirmation samplewithin 24 hours of the system's receipt of notification of the analyticalresults of the first sample. Both samples must be analyzed and the resultsreported to the State within two weeks of the initial sampling. (3) If a confirmation sample is taken for any contaminant, then the resultsof the initial and confirmation sample shall be averaged. The resultingaverage shall be used to determine the system's compliance in accordancewith paragraph (h) of this section. States have the discretion to deleteresults of obvious sampling errors. (g) The State may require more frequent monitoring than specified in paragraphs(b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section or may require confirmation samplesfor positive and negative results at its discretion.(h) Compliance with andSection; 141.11 or 141.62(b) (as appropriate) shallbe determined based on the analytical result obtained at each samplingpoint. (1) For systems which are conducting quarterly monitoring, compliance withthe maximum contaminant levels for asbestos, barium, cadmium, chromium,fluoride, mercury, and selenium is determined by a running annual averageat each sampling point. If the average at any sampling point is greaterthan the MCL, then the system is out of compliance. If any one sample wouldcause the annual average to be exceeded, then the system is out of complianceimmediately. (2) For systems which are monitoring annually, or less frequently, thesystem is out of compliance with the maximum contaminant levels for asbestos,barium, cadmium, chromium, fluoride, mercury and selenium if the levelof a contaminant at any sampling point is greater than the MCL. If a confirmationsample is required by the State, the determination of compliance will bebased on the average of the two samples. (3) Compliance with the maximum contaminant levels for nitrate and nitriteis determined based on one sample if the levels of these contaminants isbelow the MCL. If the levels of nitrate or nitrite exceed the MCLs in theinitial sample, a confirmation sample is required in accordance with paragraph(f)(2) of this section, and compliance shall be determined based on theaverage of the initial and confirmation samples. (4) If a public water system has a distribution system separable from otherparts of the distribution system with no interconnections, only that partof the system that exceeds the MCL as specified in andSection; 141.11 or141.62(b) (as appropriate) will be out of compliance. The State may allowthe system to give public notice to only that portion of the system whichis out of compliance. (i) The State has the authority to determine compliance or initiate enforcementaction based upon analytical results and other information compiled bytheir sanctioned representatives and agencies. (j) Inorganic analysis: (1) Analysis for asbestos, barium, cadmium, chromium, mercury, nitrate,nitrite, and selenium shall be conducted using the following methods:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Methodology for Inorganic Contaminants  </T4><H1>Contaminant  </H1><H1>Methodology \11\  </H1><H1>EPA \1\  </H1><H1>Reference (Method Number)  </H1><H2>ASTM \2\  </H2><H2>SM \3\  </H2><H2>Other   </H2>   <ITAG tagnum="1">Asbestos  <D>Transmission electron microscopy  </D><D>EPA \9\  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>   </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium  <D>Graphite furnace Atomic absorption; technique </D>a  <D>208.2  </D><D>  </D><D>304  </D><D>   </D></ITAG> <D>Atomic absorption; direct aspiration </D>b  <D>208.1  </D><D>  </D><D>303C  </D><D>   </D> <D>Inductively-coupled plasma-Atomic emission </D>c  <D>200.7A \6\  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>   </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium  <D>Graphite furnace Atomic absorption; technique  </D><D>213.2  </D><D>  </D><D>304  </D><D>   </D></ITAG>  <D>Inductively-coupled plasma </D>c  <D>200.7A \6\  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>   </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium  <D>Atomic absorption; furnace technique </D>a  <D>218.2  </D><D>  </D><D>304 \7\  </D><D>   </D></ITAG>   <D>Atomic absorption; direct aspiration </D>b  <D>218.1  </D><D>D1687-84D  </D><D>303A or B  </D><D>   </D>   <D>Inductively-coupled plasma </D>c  <D>200.7A \6\  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>   </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury  <D>Manual cold vapor technique  </D><D>245.1  </D><D>D3223-80  </D><D>303F  </D><D>   </D></ITAG>   <D>Automated cold vapor technique  </D><D>245.2  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>   </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrate  <D>Manual cadmium reduction  </D><D>353.3  </D><D>D3867-85B  </D><D>481C  </D><D>   </D></ITAG>   <D>Automated hydrazine reduction  </D><D>353.1  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>   </D>   <D>Automated cadmium reduction  </D><D>3532  </D><D>D3867-85A  </D><D>418F  </D><D>   </D>   <D>Ion selective electrode  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>WeWWG/5880 \5\   </D>   <D>Ion chromatography  </D><D>300.0  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>B-1011 \10\   </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrite  <D>Spectophotometric  </D><D>354.1  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>   </D></ITAG>   <D>Automated cadmium reduction  </D><D>353.2  </D><D>D3867-85A  </D><D>418F  </D><D>   </D> <D>Manual cadmium reduction  </D><D>353.3  </D><D>D3867-85B  </D><D>418C  </D><D>   </D>   <D>Ion chromatography  </D><D>300.0  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>B-1011 \10\   </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium  <D>Atomic absorption; gaseous hydride  </D><D>270.3  </D><D>D3859-84A  </D><D>303E  </D><D>I-3667-85 \4\   </D></ITAG>   <D>Atomic absorption; furnace </D>a  <D>270.2  </D><D>D3859-84B  </D><D>304 \8\  </D><D>   </D><F/>a Graphite furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GFAA).  <F/>b Direct Aspiration Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AA).  <F/>c Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES). <F>\1\ ``Methods of Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes,'' EPA EnvironmentalMonitoring and Support Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH 45268 (EPA-600/4-79-020),March 1983.

After the initial monitoring, systems shallmonitor in accordance with paragraphs (h) (12) and (13) of this section.(4) A system may request the State to reassess its vulnerability to oneor more contaminants listed in andSection; 141.61(c) provided the initialmonitoring conducted under paragraph (h)(3) of this section does not detectcontamination. (5) Systems are required to monitor only for contaminants listed in andSection;141.61(c) to which the system is vulnerable. Systems which are not classifiedas vulnerable to any contaminants listed in andSection; 141.61(c) are notrequired to monitor. (6) Vulnerable ground water systems shall take a minimum of one sampleat every entry point to the distribution system which is representativeof each well after treatment (hereafter called a sampling point). Eachsample must be taken at the same sampling point unless conditions makeanother sampling point more representative of each source or treatmentplant. (7) Vulnerable surface water systems shall take a minimum of one sampleat points in the distribution system that are representative of each sourceor at each entry point to the distribution system after treatment (hereaftercalled a sampling point). Each sample must be taken at the same samplingpoint unless conditions make another sampling point more representativeof each source or treatment plant. (8) If the system draws water from more than one source and the sourcesare combined before distribution, the system must sample at an entry pointto the distribution system during periods of normal operating conditions(i.e., when water representative of all sources is being used).  (9) The State may require a confirmation sample for positive or negativeresults. If a confirmation sample is taken, the confirmation result isaveraged with the first sampling result and the average is used for thecompliance determination as specified by andSection; 141.24(h)(14). Stateshave discretion to delete results of obvious sampling errors from thiscalculation. (10) The State may reduce the total number of samples a system must analyzeby allowing the use of compositing. Composit samples from a maximum offive sampling points are allowed. Compositing of samples must be done inthe laboaratory and analyzed within 14 days of sample collection. If theconcentration in the composite sample detects one or more contaminantslisted in andSection; 141.61(c), then a follow-up sample must be taken andanalyzed within 14 days from each sampling point included in the composite.If duplicates of the original sample taken from each sampling point usedin the composite are available, the system may use these instead of resampling.The duplicate must be analyzed and the results reported to the State within14 days of collection. (11) For the initial round of sampling each vulnerable community and non-transient,non-community water system shall take a minimum of one sample every threemonths for one year (i.e., four quarterly samples) at each sampling pointand analyze for the contaminants listed in andSection; 141.61(c) to whichit is vulnerable. (12) The repeat monitoring frequency for groundwater systems after theyear of initial monitoring is as follows: (i) When an organic contaminant(s) listed in andSection; 141.61(c) and analyzedby the system is not detected during the initial year of quarterly monitoringor any repeat monitoring required by paragraph (h)(12)(i) of this section,then: (A) Systems andgreater;500 service connections must monitor at each samplingpoint for the contaminants to which they are vulnerable every 3 years.(B) Systems andgreater;500 service connections must monitor at each samplingpoint for the contaminants to which they are vulnerable every 5 years.(ii) When an organic contaminant listed in andSection; 141.61(c) is detectedin any sample taken during the first year of monitoring or any subsequentmonitoring, then: (A) Systems andgreater;500 service connections must subsequently monitorat each sampling point every 3 months for any contaminant listed in andSection;141.61(c) to which they are vulnerable. After a system conducts three yearsof quarterly sampling, the State may allow the system to reduce the monitoringfrequency for a contaminant to an annual sample at each sampling pointif the concentration of the contaminant in each sample analyzed in theprevious 3 years is andless;50 percent of the MCL for that contaminant. (B) Systems andgreater;500 service connections must monitor annually at eachsampling point for 3 years for any contaminants listed in andSection; 141.61(c)to which they are vulnerable. When an organic contaminant listed in andSection;141.61(c) is not detected during 3 consecutive years of sampling, thenthe State may reduce the monitoring frequency for that contaminant to every3 years. States have the discretion to require systems to monitor morefrequently at any time. (13) The repeat monitoring frequency for surface water systems is as follows:(i) When an organic contaminant listed in andSection; 141.61(c) and analyzedby the system is not detected during the initial year of quarterly monitoringor any repeat monitoring required by paragraph (h)(13)(i) of this section,then: (A) Systems andgreater;500 service connections must monitor quarterly ateach sample point for the contaminants to which they are vulnerable forone year every three years.(B) Systems andCx.190;500 service connections must monitor quarterly at eachsampling point for the contaminants to which they are vulnerable for oneyear every five years. (ii) When an organic contaminant(s) listed in andSection; 141.61(c) is detectedin any sample taken during the first year of monitoring or any subsequentmonitoring, then: (A) Systems andgreater;500 service connections must subsequently monitorat each sampling point every three months for any contaminants listed inandSection; 141.61(c) to which they are vulnerable. After a system conductsthree years of quarterly sampling, the State may allow the system to reducethe monitoring frequency for a contaminant to an annual sample at eachsampling point if the concentration of the contaminant in each sample analyzedin the previous 3 years is andless;50 percent of the MCL for this contaminant.(B) Systems andCx.190;500 service connections must monitor annually at eachsampling point for any contaminant listed in andSection; 141.61(c) to whichthey are vulnerable. The State has the discretion to require systems tomonitor more frequently (i.e., quarterly). (14) Compliance with andSection; 141.61(c) shall be determined based on theanalytical results obtained at each sampling point. (i) For ground water systems which are conducting quarterly monitoring,compliance is determined by a running annual average of all samples takenat each sampling point. If the annual average of any sampling point isgreater than the MCL, then the system is out of compliance. If the initialsample or a subsequent sample would cause the annual average to be exceeded,then the system is out of compliance immediately. (ii) For surface water systems which are conducting quarterly or more frequentmonitoring, compliance is determined by a running annual average of allsamples taken at each sampling point. If the annual average of any samplingpoint is greater than the MCL, then the system is out of compliance. (iii) If monitoring is conducted annually, or less frequently, the systemis out of compliance if the level of a contaminant at any sampling pointis greater than the MCL. If a confirmation sample is required by the State,the determination of compliance will be based on the average of two samples.(iv) If a public water system has a distribution system separable fromother parts of the distribution system with no interconnections, only thatpart of the system that exceeds the MCL as specified in andSection; 141.61(c)will be out of compliance. The State may allow the system to give publicnotice to only that portion of the system which is out of compliance. (15) Analysis for the contaminants listed in andSection; 141.61(c) shallbe conducted using the following EPA methods or their equivalent as approvedby EPA.

Excessive levels of nitrate in drinking water hascaused serious illness and sometimes death in young children under oneyear of age. Infants are at the greatest risk. The serious illness in childrenis caused because nitrate is converted to nitrite in the body and nitriteinterferes with the oxygen carrying capacity of the child's blood. Thisis an acute disease in that the child can exhibit symptoms within hoursof consuming water. Symptoms include shortness of breath and blueness ofthe skin. Clearly, expert medical advice should be sought immediately ifthese symptoms occur. However, they do not always occur. The purpose ofthis notice is to encourage parents and other responsible parties to providechildren with an alternate source of drinking water. Local and State healthauthorities are the best source for information concerning alternate sourcesof drinking water for infants. You will receive notice as soon as a determinationhas been made that the drinking water is safe. EPA has set the drinkingwater standard at 10 parts per million (ppm) for nitrate to protect againstthe risk of these adverse effects. EPA has also set a drinking water standardfor nitrite at 1 ppm. To allow for the fact that the toxicity of nitrateand nitrite are additive, EPA has also established a standard for effectivenitrate (the sum of nitrate and nitrite) at 10 ppm. Drinking water whichmeets the EPA standard is associated with little to none of this risk andshould be considered safe with respect to nitrate.(21) <T3>Nitrite. </T3>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)sets drinking water standards and has determined that nitrite poses anacute health concern at certain levels of exposure.
