The Older AmericansAct Amendments of 1987 amended Section 506(a)(1)(A) of the Older AmericansAct of 1965 to require the DOL to fund national aging organizations representingIndians and Pacific Island/Asian Americans. Efforts will be made to fundtwo organizations, one for each of the two groups, to begin operationsin Program Year (PY) 1989 (July 1, 1989_June 30, 1990). This Notice makesknown the laws, guidelines, specifications and schedules which define theeligibility and other requirements with which national Indian and PacificIsland/Asian American aging organizations must comply for the preparationand submission of a funding application to the DOL.This Notice consists of: Part I_Introduction, Part II_Solicitation forGrant Application (SGA) and Part III_Submission of Funding Applications.Part II constitutes an invitation from DOL for public or nonprofit nationalIndian and Pacific Island/Asian American aging organizations with the demonstratedability to provide employment services to older Indians and older PacificIsland/Asian Americans to submit applications for the PY 1989 Older AmericansAct, Title V SCSEP program.Part III provides information on the submission of applications and thenotification of selection.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part I_Introduction</ITAG>The DOL announces competitive application instructions only for publicand nonprofit national Indian and Pacific Island/Asian American aging organizationshaving the demonstrated ability to provide employment services on a nation-widebasis to older Indians and older Pacific Island/Asian Americans. Effortswill be made to fund two such organizations, one for each group, for PY1989 (July 1, 1989_June 30, 1990). Applicants selected for funding willbe designated as grantees for a one-year period, PY 1989, if applicablestatutory, regulatory and guideline requirements are met, an acceptableapplication in response to the SGA (Part II of this Notice) is submitted,and funds are available.There are three considerations involved in setting the general parametersfor this competitive effort. They are:(1) <T3>Site Selection. </T3>The DOL considered three factors in identifyingthe States in which the two new sponsors selected will implement theirSCSEP projects:(a) <T3>The amount of PY 1989 funds allocated to each State which is in excessof the 1988 level. </T3>Section 506(a) of the Older Americans Act, in conjunctionwith any governing language in each fiscal year's appropriation Act, providesthe formula which determines the distribution of SCSEP funds among theStates. The formula determines the amount of funds allotted to each Stateand thereby the number of SCSEP positions available in each State. Forthis reason, the new projects will be in States which will receive thelargest proportionate increase in PY 1989 funds over PY 1988 in order tominimize any adverse effect on the already established projects of thecurrent SCSEP sponsors. For example, funding projects in States with smallfunding increases would require eliminating already established projectswith the attendant enrollee disruption.(b) <T3>Addressing the statutory equitable distribution requirement. </T3>Section506(c) of the Older Americans Act requires the equitable distribution ofresources among all areas in each State, including the balance betweenrural and urban areas. This requirement further supports the establishmentof the new projects in those States having a larger proportionate increasein PY 1989 funds since new positions can be placed in under-served areaswithout disrupting existing projects.(c) <T3>Presence of the Population Groups. </T3>The final site selection considerationwas the existence within a State of adequate numbers of the target populationto warrant placing a project there.After weighing all of the above considerations, DOL has determined thatthe new national Indian aging organization should establish its projectsin the States of Texas and Oklahoma. The new national Pacific Island/AsianAmerican organization should establish its projects in the States of Californiaand Oregon. These States were selected because they meet the site selectioncriteria. The particular State combinations were also based on geographicproximity to provide a greater opportunity for administrative efficiency.(2)<T3> Funding Level.</T3> The Department has established the PY 1989 fundinglevel for the two new aging organizations at $1 million each. This amountwill provide each organization with 193 positions and will allow each todevelop their programs in an orderly fashion without the administrativeproblems associated with establishing larger programs. Another factor consideredin determining the funding level was the general incidence of the two newgroups in the total eligible population. Background The SCSEP fosters and promotes useful part-time opportunities in communityservice activities for persons with low incomes who are fifty-five yearsold or older. The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of DOL operatesthe program by means of grants with eligible organizations, such as governmentalentities and eligible public and private nonprofit agencies and organizations.Those entities which are eligible to respond to this SGA are encouragedto study the Act.Summary of Eligibility Requirements Agencies and organizations eligible to respond to this SGA are those thatare: 1. Public or nonprofit national Indian and Pacific Island/Asian Americanaging organizations, other than political parties, and incorporated assuch, and 2. National in scope with the ability to provide employment services tothe eligible clientele on a nation-wide basis. National is defined as having,either directly or through local chapters or affiliates, conducted substantialbusiness in at least five different States. While DOL reserves the rightto determine what constitutes ``substantial business,'' the meaning ofthe term does include government-assisted or privately-financed programsconducted for the community welfare. The term does not mean attendanceor representation at meetings, conferences, conventions, seminars or thelike, and 3. Are able to meet the requirements of sections 502(b) and 506(a) of theAct. Since the SCSEP is a part-time employment and training program for lowincome persons who are 55 or older, organizations which have not operatedemployment and training programs should consider the cost of preparingan application against the low potential for successfully competing underthe provisions of this SGA. (See Part II_Solicitation for Grant Applicationsfor the specific rating criteria against which all applications will berated).<ITAG tagnum="84">Part II_Solicitation for Grant Application (SGA) </ITAG>The DOL is soliciting applications for grants under the provisions of TitleV of the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended, to provide part-timeemployment services to eligible older individuals. The geographic areasfor which the national Indian and Pacific Island/Asian American aging organizationscan apply are limited under this SGA.
