Evidence ismounting, however, that the Census Bureau's poverty reportdramatically understates the living standards of low-incomeAmericans, and dramatically overstates the extent of truepoverty.   The Census Bureau counts as &quot;poor&quot; anyone with &quot;cashincome&quot; less than the official poverty threshold of $12,675(for a family of four in 1989). But the bureau seriouslyundercounts the income of the poor. In fact, the bureau's owndata show that low-income households spend $1.94 for every $1in &quot;income&quot; they report. And the gap between spending andincome continues to grow larger each year. Somethingobviously is amiss.</LP><TEXT>   That something is the way the government calculatesincome. A key shortcoming in the Census data is that theydisregard assets entirely. Middle-class families that havesuffered a temporary dip in earnings are defined as poor evenif they own a house and have other substantial assets. Asecond shortcoming is that the Census ignores almost theentire welfare system when calculating the &quot;income&quot; of thepoor.   The non-partisan Congressional Research Service (CRS),part of the Library of Congress, shows that -- in constantdollars -- federal, state and local spending on&quot;means-tested&quot; programs for low income Americans, rose from$154 billion in 1980 to an all-time high of $173 billion in1988, the last year for which comprehensive data areavailable. An additional $11 billion in Medicare spending onpoor persons, which was not included in the CRS total, raisedtotal U.S. welfare spending to around $184 billion in 1988.   These dollar amounts tell only part of the story. There isalso a large conceptual gap between the &quot;poor&quot; as defined byCensus and what most Americans consider &quot;living in poverty.&quot;   According to the Census Bureau's own data, there are some22,000 &quot;poor&quot; households that own heated swimming pools orJacuzzis. Thirty-eight percent of the persons whom the CensusBureau identifies as poor own their own homes; 62% of poorhouseholds own a car; 14% own two or more cars. Nearly halfof all poor households have air-conditioning; and 31% havemicrowave ovens.   Without intending to trivialize the misfortune of thosewho are truly poor, it's important to note that most &quot;poor&quot;Americans today are far better housed, better fed and ownmore property than was the average U.S. citizen throughoutmost of this century.   In 1988, for example, after adjusting for inflation, theper-capita expenditures of the lowest income fifth of U.S.households exceeded the per-capita income of the medianAmerican household in 1955. The average &quot;poor&quot; American livesin a larger house or apartment than does the average -- notaverage non-poor, but average period -- West European. PoorAmericans eat far more meat, are more likely to own cars anddishwashers and are more likely to have basic modernamenities such as indoor toilets than is the general WestEuropean population.   So what do the numbers mean? The Census Bureau informs usthat in 1988 there were 33.3 million people with incomesbelow the official poverty line before receiving welfarebenefits. After receipt of welfare, the number of poorpersons dropped to 31.9 million. In other words, according toCensus, $184 billion in welfare spending reduced the numberof &quot;poor&quot; persons by only 1.4 million, a cost of $131,750 perperson.   This remarkable record is achieved because the Censusdisregards the effect of non-cash welfare benefits incalculating poverty. According to the Census, entireprograms, such as food stamps, public housing, Medicaid,low-income energy assistance and the Women, Infants andChildren food-assistance program might as well not exist. Of$184 billion in welfare spending, Census counts only $27billion as income for poor persons. The missing welfarespending excluded from the Census poverty reports comes to$157 billion, or more than $11,000 per poor household.   An accurate survey of the income, assets, and welfarebenefits of Americans would show far fewer poor people. Thisshould not lead us, however, to declare victory in the &quot;Waron Poverty.&quot;   Most American adults living today had a parent orgrandparent who was &quot;poor&quot; by current government standards,when adjusted for inflation. Yet the behavior of theseindividuals from earlier generations was middle class, aswere the values they transmitted to their children.   Many of today's poor are trapped in a &quot;behavioral poverty&quot;that is far crueler and more pernicious than the materialpoverty experienced by earlier generations. The explosion ofwelfare spending in the past 25 years has created entirecommunities where work is rare, intact families unknown anddependence on government a way of life passed on fromgeneration to generation. Individuals who were intended to bethe beneficiaries of the welfare state are instead itsvictims.   Everyone should be justifiably concerned about personsliving in material poverty through no fault of their own. Butthe current poverty reports tells us little about realpoverty in the U.S. And by focusing attention solely onmaterial living standards it distracts attention from the farmore serious issue of &quot;behavioral poverty.&quot;   This is a problem that can't be fixed without a thoroughunderstanding of the nature and extent of poverty in America-- a picture the Census Bureau report only blurs.   ---   Mr. Rector is welfare and poverty policy analyst at theHeritage Foundation, in Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
