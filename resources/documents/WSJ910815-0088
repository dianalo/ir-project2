The company, CRSS Inc., said that for 11 years Mr. Pharaoncontrolled up to 20% of its stock, which is traded on the NewYork Stock Exchange. He sold the shares, valued at $5.8million at the time of purchase, for about $27.8 million in1989.</LP><TEXT>   During the period that Mr. Pharaon held the shares, CRSSwon contracts to help design and manage base construction forthe Royal Saudi Air Force. The contracts, paid for with Saudimoney but administered by the Pentagon as a foreign militarysale, helped CRSS prosper when low oil prices were depressingits other business in Saudi Arabia.   Unknown to company offficials, Mr. Pharaon pledged almosthalf of his CRSS stock to officials of Bank of Credit andamp;Commerce International, which does not appear to haveexercised any influence over the company. Indeed, CRSSappears to be one of the few U.S. enterprises that thrivedwhile Mr. Pharaon was involved with it.   Mr. Pharaon's investment was fully disclosed and perfectlylegal, although the lawfulness of his pledging the shares toBCCI is murky. If ownership of the shares were transferred,he and BCCI would have been required to disclose that fact tothe Securities and Exchange Commission; merely pledging theshares as security for a loan wouldn't have requireddisclosure.   Among the companies less fortunate in their dealings withthe BCCI representative was Sam P. Wallace Co., a majorDallas-based mechanical and industrial contractor. Mr.Pharaon bought 66% of the stock in 1982, and restructured theentire company, firing managers and implementing his ownmanagement philosophy.   Two years later, he sold it to Ronald Chamness, anengineer who owned a competing firm. &quot;He sold me a companythat had a book value in excess of $20 million. In truth, ithad a value of a minus $10 million,&quot; asserts Mr. Chamness.   Mr. Pharaon's attorneys denied the charges. Mr. Chamnessran out of funds and had to take the Wallace firm intobankruptcy. &quot;I've often wondered what he did with my $15million check,&quot; he says wistfully. Many of the Wallaceshares, like the CRSS shares, were pledged in irrevocablestock transfer forms that were delivered to BCCI's Londonoffice.   Whatever was transpiring in this tale of two companies, itwas clear that CRSS got the better deal. David Bartlett, aninvestment banker with First Hanover Securities Inc. in NewYork, who follows the engineering and construction business,says he often visited the two companies and was amazed at thedifferences. &quot;I went down there and you could virtually seethe Wallace management folding under them. Then I'd zip overto Houston and see absolutely the converse.&quot;   Through a company in the Netherlands Antilles, Mr. Pharaonbought the CRSS shares at a time when about 50% of the firm'sbusiness came from construction projects it had designed forclients in Saudi Arabia. But at the time, the firm's futurelooked bleak. Because of declining oil prices, theconstruction binge in Saudi Arabia was beginning to languish.   But within nine months, CRSS was picked from over 100 U.S.companies by the U.S. Air Force Logistics Command as part ofa joint venture to design and build Saudi military bases.Over the next 12 years, the company received a succession ofcontracts for the bases for F-15, F-16 and AWACs aircraft.The contracts helped revive CRSS's work backlog, bringing inwell over $120 million of revenue.   Bruce R. Wilkinson, CRSS's chairman, said Mr. Pharaonplayed no role in the company's getting the contracts. &quot;Thereis no causal connection whatsoever between his buying stockand then suddenly everything getting rosy in Saudi Arabia,&quot;says Mr. Wilkinson. Mr. Pharaon, he says, opted for a&quot;passive&quot; role and never attended a board meeting or weighedin on a major decision.   Mr. Pharaon's presence at CRSS ended in August 1989, when,Mr. Wilkinson says, the Saudi investor called to say he wasselling his shares in the company. &quot;He said it had been agood long ride, the stock was reaching high levels. He said,`Don't take this personally, but investors are in thebusiness of buying and selling.'&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
