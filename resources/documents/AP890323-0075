Leaders of China's eight so-called democratic parties also saidthey expected more government officials to be appointed from theirranks.   On Tuesday, Communist Party authorities announced a plan to allowthe eight parties to participate in China's government.   Yan Mingfu, who heads the Communist Party's office that dealswith other parties, said the plan will be ready by June or July.   Cooperation among the eight parties, he said, will occur onlyunder the leadership of the Communist Party, which has ruled Chinasince 1949.   The plan comes as a growing number of intellectuals are callingfor more political freedom and appears to be an attempt by theCommunist Party to silence critics without relinquishing power.   Today's announcement, which came at a news conference onmultiparty cooperation, further emphasized this point. The newsconference was held by the Chinese People's Political ConsultativeConference, a prestigious but powerless advisory body currentlymeeting in Beijing.   ``The Communist Party of China and the eight democratic partiesshare the same goals. We are in the same boat,'' said Wan Guoquan,vice chairman of the China Democratic National Committee. ``Justlike a symphony, a country needs a conductor. The Communist Party isour conductor.''   Zhao Weizhi, secretary general of the Jiusan Society, said Chinawould not allow new parties to form.   ``The eight democratic parties already represent a wide part ofsociety,'' he said. ``So no new parties are needed.''</TEXT></DOC>
