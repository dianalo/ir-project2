Any citizen whoowns an asset, and who has no fiduciary responsibility overits disposition, should be permitted to call anyone in theworld and ask for information on its prospects forappreciation or depreciation -- and buy or sell on anyinformation gleaned.   If I own shares or am thinking of buying shares in GeneralMotors, I am protected by the First Amendment to theConstitution if I call the chairman of GM, the directors ortheir investment bankers and ask them any question I canimagine. And I can buy and sell on the information theyprovide. Any laws that make it a crime for me to do so arepatently unconstitutional. The government can make it a crimefor me to own a particular asset, to sell an asset at a pricethe government deems unfair. But the Constitution does notpermit the government to criminalize my communications ininquiring as to its prospects.</LP><TEXT>   The frenzied outrage over the fact that a lot of peoplehave made money buying and selling assets on Wall Street inrecent years should not obscure the fact that there arefundamental rights we possess and should defend. Federalprosecutors, judges and juries who have been swept up in thisfrenzy over tales of untrammeled greed on Wall Street shouldbear this in mind. In the Waldbaum case, you correctly pointout that Robert Chestman was convicted and jailed for a&quot;crime that he did not commit -- and that the judges ruleddoes not exist.&quot;   Another egregious example in this vein was the convictionof Robert Freeman of Goldman Sachs for trading on &quot;insideinformation.&quot; Mr. Freeman was actually indicted on a varietyof charges that were dropped when he agreed to plead guiltyto trading on the news that his &quot;Bunny has a good nose.&quot;Because Mr. Freeman had no fiduciary responsibilitiesviolated in the subsequent transactions, he thus pleadedguilty to a crime that does not exist in order to give thefeds their pound of flesh. I suggest a new law, perhaps evena capital crime, that prohibits U.S. citizens from pleadingguilty to crimes that do not exist.   Jude Wanniski   President   Polyconomics Inc.
