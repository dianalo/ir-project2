He will &quot;stand up&quot; to foreign trading partners but will still honor &quot;our treaties . . . because that's the kind of country we are.&quot; He warns that &quot;they&quot; want to &quot;anesthetize us&quot; -- the &quot;they&quot; including a &quot;Yuppie, Harvard&quot; elite class more intent on making money and talk than real goods or crops.    His message is one of protest but also of community. &quot;It's your fight, too&quot; is his slogan, and that fight as he expresses it is to regain control of America's &quot;economic destiny&quot; by pressuring foreign governments to end trade restrictions on U.S. goods and demanding that American corporations invest more in this country.    A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that likely Democratic voters put Rep. Gephardt in the middle of the three front-of-the-pack candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, trailing Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis but ahead of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. The same poll indicates a potentially receptive audience for Mr. Gephardt's message. By a 71%-15% margin, these voters said they were more likely to support a candidate who says the U.S. must get tougher with its foreign trading partners. By a narrower 47%-35%, these voters said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who says large corporations are to blame for many of the nation's economic problems.    On the stump, Mr. Gephardt casts his economic argument in moral terms. He assures anxious workers of the essential rightness of their cause, and argues that government has an obligation to act as their advocate. He seeks to put aside past differences over federal spending and taxes, offering instead a new cast of devils against which to unite. Going into the Super Tuesday voting next week, the Missouri Democrat's message is aimed especially at older, working-class whites, and at under-30 voters who backed Ronald Reagan but who today worry about their standard of living and security in an international economy.    What's interesting about Rep. Gephardt's message is its diversity. There is a heavy dose of populism, but it also taps into the same oil interests and Southern conservatives who promoted Mr. Reagan's early economic agenda. While the operation is run by former aides to Sen. Edward Kennedy, it also borrows ideas from conservative GOP theorist Kevin Phillips.    &quot;He believes the basic problem is economic decline and that it's hurting average, ordinary working people and they feel they're out of control,&quot; Mr. Gephardt says of Mr. Phillips' writings. &quot;A Kennedy and a Kevin Phillips, from different perspectives, are truly concerned about the same phenomenon.&quot;    Mr. Gephardt's strategy has brought him victories in Iowa and South Dakota, and he wages a bitter fight now to knock Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore out of the race in the South. If he succeeds, he can go head-to-head then with Gov. Dukakis in Midwestern industrial states, where ads similar to his trade message were used by Ohio Democrats two years ago and where the Journal/NBC News poll shows he has a strong base.    Mr. Gore represents a threat to Mr. Gephart only in the South, according to the poll. The two men appear to be in a dead heat, and the poll indicates Mr. Gephardt has yet to establish the edge he enjoys elsewhere in the nation over Mr. Gore as the candidate &quot;you think cares most about people like you.&quot;    Rep. Gephardt hopes to win in Texas, the largest state up for grabs, but his challenge there -- and longer term -- is distinguishing himself from Gov. Dukakis. Despite Mr. Gephardt's heavy emphasis on trade, the poll gives the governor higher points in the South and across the country as the candidate who would do the best job of standing up for American economic interests: 29% to Mr. Gephardt's 13% in the South, and 32% to Mr. Gephardt's 19% nationally. And this lead is most pronounced among the young voters Mr. Gephardt wants to draw.    A 44-year-old boiler engineer in Mobile, Jerry Mitchell is a composite of the political forces that the Gephardt campaign hopes to reach. The George Wallace Democrat twice voted for Mr. Reagan but now will support Rep. Gephardt, who reminds him of Harry Truman. &quot;He's more Southern than Gore,&quot; Mr. Mitchell says. &quot;I just like the way he talks.&quot;    Among older Democrats, Mr. Gephardt's fundamentalism taps the party's old-time economic religion -- and old resentments. &quot;The people love you for the enemies you make,&quot; says Joseph Azbell, a political columnist and former Wallace speech writer in Montgomery. &quot;This is the only man who is making the right enemies.&quot;    A younger generation of white males, which has never experienced conflict or war, finds a manly appeal in the &quot;get tough&quot; trade message. &quot;Gephardt's muscular economic populism is made to order for these guys,&quot; says Prof. Ralph Whitehead of the University of Massachusetts; the message taps a cultural vein that runs through Bruce Springsteen's lyrics and Madison Avenue's ads for beer and blue jeans.    By avoiding ideology, Rep. Gephardt is attune to a generation that wants no part of the &quot;movement&quot; politics of its older brothers or sisters from the 1960s, but which nevertheless is concerned as it ages with immediate priorities of wages, elderly parents and its children's education and safety from drugs. &quot;They are reconnecting themselves to a basic democratic sense of community,&quot; says Gephardt pollster Edward Reilly.    The single-mindedness of Mr. Gephardt's message has helped him overcome the handicaps of a legislator in a presidential campaign, but when he asks Democrats to step back from past fights to forge a new majority, he must step back from his own record. He attacks the &quot;elite&quot; view that Social Security benefits must be cut to reduce the deficit. Yet, as recently as 1985, both he and Texas Rep. Marvin Leath, one of his principal point men in the South, supported a bold-but-doomed effort to break the budget deadlock by proposing both tax increases and cuts from cost-of-living increases for the   Similarly, his willingness this week to describe the Reagan administration's tax cuts in 1981 as &quot;fair&quot; represents a retreat from a position he and the House leadership have long taken, and from his own vote in 1983 specifically to cap the tax cut for wealthy families.    Efforts by his rivals to challenge his credibility appear to have been blunted. The Journal/NBC News poll found Democrats evenly divided when asked if Mr. Gephardt had &quot;flip-flopped&quot; more or less than his rivals, and the gap between him and Mr. Dukakis narrows when voters were asked which candidate most believes in the issues on which he is campaigning.    As Mr. Gephardt's views have evolved, so have his ties with oil. Independent producers poured millions of dollars into conservative campaigns in 1980 and were rewarded with concessions in the 1981 tax bill. In the years since, the same interests have been courted by prominent Democrats in the Gephardt camp, and the candidate's proposed oil-import fee would assist the hard-hit industry now by increasing the yield on production.    A likable man, Mr. Gephardt follows his script with a methodical intensity, but there are lapses for even him. &quot;Praise the Lord,&quot; he interjects in an awkward effort to connect with black parishoners in a Mississippi church. While he regularly attacks The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorials before working-class audiences, he is silent at a poolside fund-raiser hosted by an Alabama banker and attended by such wealthy figures as industrialist June Collier-Mason, a large GOP contributor in the past.    ---   'WOULD you be more or less likely to vote for a candidate who says the United States must get tougher with its foreign trading partners?'
