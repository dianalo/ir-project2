The nation's largest supermarket operator said the cash paymentswill be made Friday and soon be followed by distribution ofpromised debentures, also part of the restructuring plan.   Kroger offered the up-front payments to entice shareholders tosupport its plan to reorganize itself into a smaller, but stillindependent food retailer.   Kroger has pressed ahead with the $4.6 billion restructuringplan it proposed in September, despite two outside offers to buythe company. Kroger rebuffed both offers.   The company promised to pay shareholders $40 in cash per commonshare, plus $17 in principal on a junior subordinated discountdebenture intended to have an $8 trading value.   At least four shareholder suits have been filed against Krogerto challenge its conclusion that the restructuring is a betterfinancial alternative than buyout offers from ther investment firmKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. of New York, or from the Dart GroupInc. of Landover, Md.   Kohlberg Kravis made a $5.03 billion, or $64-per-share, bid thatKroger officials said could run into antitrust objections becausethe investment firm has other supermarket holdings. Kohlberg Kraviswithdrew the bid after it was rejected by Kroger.   Dart, which began the Kroger takeover bidding Sept. 19, offered$4.32 billion, or $55 per share. Dart offered to help Kroger fightthe Kohlberg Kravis bid, but has refused to say whether its ownoffer had been withdrawn.   Kroger said it would have to sell some company assets, includingstores, food processing plants and corporate real estate, to offsetcosts of restructuring.   The company also fired about 300 of its 800 Cincinnati corporateheadquarters employees, giving them extended pay, health care andrelocation allowances in termination payments on a one-day notice.The firings did not include personnel in its supermarkets.   The 105-year-old company has approximately 170,000 employees and52,000 shareholders. Kroger operates more than 1,300 supermarkets,900 convenience stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states.</TEXT></DOC>
