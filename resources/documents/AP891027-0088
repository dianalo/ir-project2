The Bush administration and the Senate panel reached ``a meetingof the minds'' at meetings over the past two weeks, culminating ina detailed session Thursday with representatives of the CIA, thePentagon and the State Department, said Senate committee ChairmanDavid Boren, D-Okla.   Boren said his understanding is that U.S. officials will be freeto counsel and consult with potential coup plotters so long as theplot does not specifically set out to assassinate Noriega.   Also on Thursday, the intelligence panel approved a billauthorizing intelligence activities for the next two years andsettling a long-running dispute over how the president reportsclandestine overseas operations to Congress.   The committee dropped a proposal to force such disclosureswithin an absolute 48-hour limit after Bush agreed to put inwriting his policies on informing Congress.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, speaking to reporterstoday on Air Force One en route to Costa Rica, said Bush will senda letter to Congress as early as next week formalizing theagreement to notify lawmakers ``within a few days'' of any covertoperation.   Bush ``doesn't believe in having an artificial deadline'' tocarry out his foreign policy duties, Fitzwater said.   The compromise followed nine months of negotiations andessentially restored the understandings on reporting covertoperations that existed 10 years ago, before they were tattered bythe Iran-Contra affair.   Boren said the committee held a thorough discussion Thursdaybehind closed doors with officials of the CIA, State Department andPentagon on the Oct. 3 failed Panama coup and what can be done toprepare for any similar situation in the future.   Since the coup's failure, Congress and the White House havetraded accusatios over who was to blame for the lack of U.S.preparation. Administration officials have contended Congress tiedtheir hands through too strict an interpretation of thegovernment's ban on participation in assassinations of foreignleaders.   ``We have removed any ambiguities'' that may have clouded themeaning of the 1976 executive order that bans U.S. participation inassassination plots, Boren said. Bush is referring the matter tothe Justice Department for a new interpretation of the order, saidBoren, adding, ``We start with a clean slate.''   He added: ``No one feels that the executive order prohibitingassassinations should be taken to the extreme position that youhave to warn someone (of a coup being plotted against them) or thatyou can't participate in planning a coup where assassination is notthe objective.''   On the subject of congressional notification of covertoperations, the panel also dropped a ban on the CIA's ability touse its contingency fund to launch new covert operations which hadnot been reported to Congress.   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, the intelligence panel's vicechairman, had proposed the 48-hour provision after thecongressional Iran-Contra hearings, during which it became clearPresident Reagan neglected for more than 10 months to tell theIntelligence committees of the House and Senate that he was sellingweapons to Iran in hopes of winning the release of Americans heldhostage in the Middle East.   Cohen said Bush has promised to give the committees prior noticeof covert actions ``on virtually all occasions.''   In rare cases when prior notice is not given, the president willlet Congress know ``within a few days,'' Cohen said. And should thepresident let notification slip beyond that time period, he will doso only with an assertion of constitutional authority that wouldsupersede any law written by Congress.   No president would make such an assertion lightly and risk thekind of situation that confronted Reagan in the Iran-Contrascandal, he said. ``It almost undid the Reagan presidency,'' hesaid. ``And if it happens again, I'm sure it will undo a futureone.''   ``This essentially puts us back to the understanding we had in1980,'' before Reagan took office, Cohen said.   He called the agreement the best that could be arranged.Congress would likely have been able to force the strict 48-hourlimit into the bill, but would have been unable to override avirtually certain presidential veto, Cohen said.   The bill also writes into the law for the first timerequirements that all covert operations be authorized by apresidential decision document known as a ``finding'' before theyare carried out, and that the document specify which agencies andother countries, if any, are to be involved.   And it would create for the first time an independent inspectorgeneral at the CIA, to be appointed by the president and confirmedby the Senate. Such an independent investigator would improveinternal CIA management and the ability of Congress to perform itsoversight job, the committee concluded.   A House-passed version of the intelligence bill does not includethe independent inspector general provision, but instead specifiesthat the oversight committees must be given complete access toinvestigation and audit reports conducted under the currentarrangement.</TEXT></DOC>
