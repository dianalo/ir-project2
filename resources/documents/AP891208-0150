In Leningrad, an estimated 40,000 rank-and-file Communistsrallied this week to support President Mikhail S. Gorbachev againstwhat they said was a bid to oust him.   The street meeting of Leningrad progressives was held Wednesdaynight to counter a Nov. 22 rally by conservatives. Several bannersat that meeting were critical of Gorbachev and his policy ofperestroika, or reconstruction, of the nation's political andeconomic system.   One banner shown on Leningrad TV from the Nov. 22 rally read,``We won't let you kill communism with perestroika.''   The Communist Party is under unprecedented pressure, asLithuania on Thursday became the first republic in the Soviet Unionto drop a constitutional guarantee of Communist supremacy andsubstitute a multiparty system within Lithuania.   Prior to the Leningrad meeting, activists handed out leafletswarning that Gorbachev and his closest Polituburo allies, AlexanderYakovlev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, could lose theirparty jobs at Saturday's Central Commmittee meeting, said activistGennady Bogomolov.   He quoted the leaflet as saying, ``Everybody, come to themeeting of protest against reactionary forces, against the attemptsto incite the convening of an extraordinary plenum of the CentralCommittee to demote Gorbachev, Yakovlev and Shevardnadze.''   Rumors of Politburo shake-ups abound before every CentralCommittee meeting, since it is the only body empowered to changeits members, including Gorbachev, its general secretary. However,Gorbachev now enjoys a measure of security, since he hasstrengthened the power of the government and has been elected to afive-year term as president.   The official news agency Tass said the meeting will covermeasures for curing the sickly Soviet economy, the economicfive-year plan that starts in 1991 and a speech by Premier NikolaiRyzhkov, who handles economic matters.   The Central Committee was expected to prepare for the nextsession of the Congress of People's Deputies, the nationalparliament, which convenes Tuesday.   In Moscow, the city party committee criticized the government'seconomic reforms and called on the Politburo ``not to take hastyand insufficiently considered political decisions,'' according tothe national TV news show ``Vremya.''   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and several othermembers of parliament have called for a brief general strike Mondayto call on the Congress to copy Lithuania's action on the nationallevel and drop Article 6 from the Soviet Constitution. The articleguarantees the Communists a ``leading and guiding role'' in Sovietlife.   The strike call received a significant dose of publicity Fridaynight when ``Vremya'' mentioned it several times, all negatively.   On Friday, the official party newspaper Pravda responded to theeffort with defensive language.   ``Under cover of such talk, attempts are being made to diminishor even to devalue the party's prestige and to oust it out ofactive political life,'' Pravda said in an editorial that filledhalf of the front page. ``Perestroika needs the party, but arenewed, active and strong party.''   But Pravda also gave the clearest signal yet that the partymight be willing to see a change in Article 6.   ``Any constitutional provision, such as Article 6, can besubjected to re-evaluation, modernization, and even abolition,''the editorial said. But it suggested that any constitutionalchanges should be delayed to a planned complete rewrite of thenation's basic law.   The Baltic republic of Estonia is due to vote Dec. 15 on aproposal to drop a similar provision from its Constitution. OnThursday, speakers at a meeting of the Communist Party of Estoniasaid they favor that change, said Harry Tiido, a commentator onofficial Estonian radio.   ``The Communist Party in the Baltic is crumbling,'' Tiido said.``We have a de facto multiparty system.''   The Leningrad street meeting Nov. 22 marked the emergence ofLeningrad Communist Party chief Boris Gidaspov as a leader ofconservative forces.   At the counterdemonstration of progressives on Wednesday,Gidaspov tried to speak but he was drowned out by shouts of``Resign! Resign!'' according to Friday's edition of the newspaperKomsomolskaya Pravda.   Gidaspov was named Leningrad party chief last summer. Since theholder of that position normally also gains a place on the nationalparty's ruling Politburo, the Central Committee may vote on thatissue Saturday.   Gidaspov replaced Yuri Solovyov, who suffered an embarrassingdefeat in the parliamentary elections last spring, the firstmulticandidate elections in Soviet history. As Leningrad partychief, Gidaspov normally would be expected to be named by the250-member Central Committee to the ruling Politburo.</TEXT></DOC>
