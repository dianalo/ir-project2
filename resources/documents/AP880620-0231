Called the Pantanal, it is a wildlife haven, a little-knownutopia for hundreds of bird species, waterfowl, wild marsh deer,crocodiles, black-spotted jaguars, aquatic flowers and fresh-waterfish.   The floodplain is slightly smaller than California, extendingfor 54,000 square miles in Brazil and 100,000 square miles intoBolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina.   It is known in parts of those other countries as the Gran Chaco.   In Brazil's Pantanal, in the sparsely populated western statesof Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, illegal but profitableactivities encroach on this paradise.   Just last year, 2 million crocodiles were killed for theirhides. Countless other animal skins and live exotic birds weresmuggled out. Cocaine traffickers invaded the region in increasingnumbers. Prospectors separating gold from river silt left behindsome 40 tons of toxic mercury, poisoning fish, animals and people _including themselves.   ``It's a monumental problem,'' Guilherme Augusto Borges, abiologist with Mato Grosso's environmental-protection agency, saidin an interview. He added that the full extent of damage to thePantanal is not known, and that research into the problem is in itsinfant stages.   ``But if it takes five years of study to find out what'shappening here, that's too long,'' Borges said. ``It may be toolate by then.''   Every year from October to March the waters of the 840-mileParaguay River, the Pantanal's main water source, and itstributaries flood two-thirds of the region.   The high water strands cows shoulder-deep and sometimes bringsriver snakes right to the doors of farmhouses. Without the floods,there would be no Pantanal. The floods keep the swamp's delicateecosystem in balance. High water allows wildlife to breed anddiscourages the Pantanal's main predator: man.   Cyclical chaotic flooding, expected every decade or so andoccurring this year, threatening the lives of about 800,000 cattle,also is part of the natural aquatic balance. Uncontrolled floodingtends to be most serious around Corumba, on the Paraguay River inMato Grosso do Sul, just across the border from Bolivia.   Mayor Hugo Silva da Costa of Corumba, a cancer surgeon turnedpolitician, said the flooding has been getting worse. This year thewaters in the region rose 22 feet _ seven feet above the level atwhich swamp isles are inundated and trees die, depriving animals oftheir habitat.   ``The water gets higher and higher every year,'' the mayor said.``The temperature is changing. And in the dry season there is lesswater and less grass for grazing.''   He added that he believed the changes were directly linked toincreased human activity in the Pantanal.   ``The Pantanal is suffering, and something has to be donefast,'' said da Costa, who in April declared a state of emergencyin Corumba.   Osvaldo da Cunha, a physician and the owner of a 29,000-acreranch 75 miles from Cuiaba, Mato Grosso's capital, says a newenvironmental abuse in the Pantanal comes from farms where dikesare built to hold off flooding and chemical pesticides are used togrow rice, corn and soybeans.   ``With dikes, the land can be used year round,'' he said. ``Butthe water barriers upset the natural cycle.''   Da Cunha said also that crocodile hunting in the Pantanal, nowillegal but almost impossible to control, may become legal becauseof the ``violent economic pressure'' because of Brazil's chronicunemployment and runaway inflation.   To discourage poachers from invading his Santa Inez Ranch, daCunha has begun a laborious process of ``fingerprinting'' hiscaiman crocodiles, cousins of the alligators found in the southernUnited States, much in the style of the branding of cattle.   Biologist Anacleto Garcia de Arruda, 26, who is in charge of theproject, midnight rounds in a canoe, grabbing crocodiles by theneck.   He starts with baby caimans, weighing them, counting their teethand pinning colored sequins on their scales to identify themthrough maturity. He says he has no idea of the number ofcrocodiles on the ranch and that the ``branding'' process will takefour years.   The caimans are easy prey for poachers who at night paralyzethem with strong flashlights beamed into their crimson,reflector-like eyes. Then they shoot them.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
