Although Democratic rival Michael Dukakis is assured the party'spresidential nomination, Jackson gave no sign Saturday of backingdown.   ``Some people have made unreasonable requests, like if we wouldjust surrender, we would have a prime-time speaking place,'' hesaid.   ``My name will be in nomination,'' he said. ``We will have(platform) planks on the floor, those that are not resolved betweennow and that time, and that should be a reasonable expectation.''   But he added that he does not plan to lead a walkout of hisdelegates.   ``It would not be to our advantage to walk out,'' Jackson said.``The threat is not that we're going to walk out. The threat isthat we're going to stay and expand and build and grow and make adifference.''   Jackson spoke to reporters as he attended a small privatefund-raiser for his Keep Hope Alive Political Action Committee atthe Bel Air Estates home of director-producer Larkin Arnold.   The Jackson and Dukakis camps already have resolved disputesover party rules and delegate credentials, and Jackson said heexpects negotiators for both campaigns to continue meeting tosettle differences on other subjects.   He called for an expanded schedule at the convention to allowminority issues to be addressed.   ``We're making history not hysteria,'' he said. ``We're doingwhat's standard and what's normal and what we've earned the rightto do.''   Jackson reserved comment on potential vice presidentialcandidates, and said he and Dukakis have yet to personally discussin depth the possibility of Jackson being the running mate. Jacksonsaid he expects to have such a private talk before the start of theconvention on July 18.   Jackson campaign manager Gerald Austin told the Boston Globethis week that Jackson's followers would be ``outraged,'' as wouldAustin himself, if Dukakis picked former presidential candidateSen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee as his running mate.   Jackson said the comment had been Austin's personal opinion.   ``No one is authorized in my campaign to give a value judgmentor a political evaluation of anyone else under consideration,'' hesaid.   Jackson confirmed he had sent a private message to Gore statingthat he personally has not made any private or public judgmentregarding any potential running mate's qualifications for the vicepresidential slot.</TEXT></DOC>
