London prices fell in moderate trading.    The Nikkei average rose to a 63.98-point gain, finishing at 28084.08, after closing down 51.70 points in the morning session. The Tokyo Stock Exchange first section index, which fell 10 points Wednesday, rose 0.91 points to close at 2198.88. Volume was estimated at 2.1 billion shares, compared with two billion Wednesday.    In early trading in Tokyo Friday, shares prices advanced and the Nikkei index stood at 28151.83, up 67.75 points.    Traders and salesmen said that until the final hour of trading Thursday, the market had maintained its focus on large-capitalization steel and shipping stocks. But in the final hour, attention shifted to the blue-chip electricals, with initial buy orders for Hitachi and Matsushita Electric.    Casey A. Flaherty, a trader with Yamaichi Securities Co., said that the shift began when word went around that Nomura Securities Co.'s investment trust had placed a major order for Hitachi.    The interest spread from Hitachi to the other electricals, and then to the auto makers.    Hitachi ended up at 1670 yen ($12.60), up 80 yen, while Mitsubishi Electric went to 965, up 20 yen.    Toshiba was heavily traded but closed with a modest 10-yen gain at 1070. Fuji Electric was up 47 yen to 882, while NEC gained 130 yen to 2180 and Matsushita also gained 130 yen to 2630.    Among consumer electricals, Sony rose 110 yen to 5400, while Sanyo was 52 yen higher at 800.    Among auto makers, Toyota rose 80 yen to 2720, while Honda was up 50 yen to 1850. Nissan, however, eased 10 yen to 1250 in heavy trading.    Among the heavy industrials, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries closed 30 yen higher at 1020 on heavy volume of 239.7 million shares. Mitsui Engineering andamp; Shipbuilding rose 35 yen to 695.    Among steels, Kawasaki Steel was up 12 yen to 748, while Nippon Steel gained 12 yen to 723.    Japan Air Lines rose 200 yen to 13800 yen ($104.10), after the company announced earnings of 19.4 billion yen ($146.7 million) in the year ended March 31, rebounding from a loss of 7.5 billion yen ($56.6 million) in the previous year.    In London, the U.S. prime-rate boost punctured a rally that was sparked by some favorable U.K. economic statistics.    The Financial Times 100-Share Index fell eight points to 1863.3, its low for the day. The narrower 30-share index fell 4.1 points to 1496.7. Volume was 526.6 million shares, compared with 430.8 million a day earlier.    London shares started gaining following news that British manufacturing output rose a better-than-expected 1.1% in May from April, and that U.K. wage growth steadied in May. But the boost in U.S. interest rates, to 9.5% from 9%, undermined the rally, dealers said.    Plessey, an electronics concern, finished 2 1/2 pence higher at 169 1/2 after the company announced it agreed to buy U.S.-based Singer Co.'s electronic systems division for $310 million.    Pearson, a British industrial conglomerate, finished 13 pence higher at 735. Dealers said two large buy orders in the morning triggered the rise.    Merchant bank Morgan Grenfell rose 5 to 320 on talk of a dawn raid Friday by an unnamed European bank. Merchant banking issues were generally higher in sympathy with Morgan Grenfell, dealers said. S.G. Warburg advanced a penny to 321 while Joseph gained 10 to 438.    Beecham rose 2 to 474, having been as high as 479 earlier in the session. Analysts said several brokerages issued favorable buy recommendations in the wake of positive test results from Beecham's Eminase heart drug.    Cable andamp; Wireless advanced 12 to 380. Several dealers cited buying interest spurred by a large market order. Others said a bullish survey on the outlook for a Cable andamp; Wireless subsidiary by a brokerage propelled shares.    In Frankfurt, prices ended higher, helped by a firm dollar and Wednesday's rally on Wall Street.    Brokers said turnover was moderate, although slightly depressed ahead of the results of the meeting by the Deutsche Bundesbank's central bank council. The central bank announced towards the close of trading that it left West Germany's monetary policy and its interest rates unchanged.    Thyssen AG, a steelmaker, rose 4.20 marks to 147.30 marks ($79.97). It said it expects a sharp rise in profit for its fiscal nine months and plans an increase in its dividend.    Issues of other steelmakers also gained: Hoesch rose 2.80 marks to 143 and Mannesmann rose 2.40 marks to 155.90.    Retailing issues benefited from developments at Asko, a major discount retailer, which also reported plans to increase its 1988 dividend because of a rise in sales and earnings.    Asko ended 16 marks higher at 950, while Karstadt was up 2 marks to 431 and Kaufhof gained 12 marks to 370.    Auto issues rose, helped by the firm dollar. Bayerische Motoren Werke gained 5 marks to 523, Daimler-Benz also rose 5 marks to 706 and Volkswagen was up 8.70 marks to 267.    Banking issues also were higher. Deutsche Bank rose 8.20 marks to 479.20, Dresdner Bank gained 5.50 marks to 259.50 and Commerzbank rose 2.30 marks to 231.50.    Elsewhere in Europe, shares closed mixed in Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam and Stockholm, and were lower in Milan. In Pacific markets, prices closed at a record high in Taipei, and were higher in Seoul and Singapore. Hong Kong, Manila and Wellington were mixed and Sydney prices were flat.
