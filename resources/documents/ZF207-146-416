(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Infection Protection Like its biological counterpart, a computer virus is anagent of infection, insinuating itself into a program or disk and forcing itshost to replicate the virus code.andP;  Hackers fascinated by the concept of&quot;living&quot; code wrote the first viruses as projects or as pranks.andP;  In the pastfew years, however, a different kind of virus has become common, one thatlives up to an earlier meaning of the word: in Latin, virus meand poison.andM;These new viruses incorporate features of another type of insidious programcalled a Trojan horse.andP;  Such a program masquerades as a useful utility orproduct but wreaks havoc on your system when you run it.andP;  It may erase a fewfiles, format your disk, steal secrets--anything software can do, a Trojanhorse can do.andP;  A malicious virus can do all this and then attempt toreplicate itself and infect other systems.andM;The growing media coverage of the virus concept and of specific viruses haspromoted the development of a new type of software.andP;  Antivirus programs,vaccines--they go by many names, but their purpose is to protect you fromvirus attack.andP;  At present there are more antivirus programs than knownviruses.andM;Some experts quibble about exactly what a virus is.andP;  The most widely knownviruses, the IBM Xmas virus and the recent Internet virus, are not viruses atall according to some experts because they do not infect other programs.andO;Others argue that every Trojan horse is a virus--one that depends completelyon people to spread it.andP;  The distinction doesn't matter to the antivirusprograms.andP;  Whether the attempt to format your hard disk comes from a virus, aTrojan horse, or you yourself (by accident), the program should sound thealarm.andM;HOW THEY REPRODUCEandM;Viruses can't travel without people.andP;  Your PC will not become infected unlesssomeone runs an infected program on it, whether accidentally or on purpose.andO;PCs are different from mainframe networks in this way--the mainframe Internetvirus spread by transmitting itself to other systems and ordering them toexecute it as a program.andP;  That kind of active transmission is not possible ona PC.andM;Virus code reproduces by changing something in your system.andP;  Some virusesstrike COMMAND.COM or the hidden system files.andP;  Others, like the notoriousPakistani-Brain virus, modify the boot sector of floppy disks.andP;  Still othersattach themselves to ant .COM ro .EXE file.andP;  In truth, any file on yoursystem that can be executed--whether it's a program, a device driver, anoverlay, or even a batch file--could be the target of a virus.andM;When an infected program runs, the virus code usually executes first and thentransfers control to the original program.andP;  The virus may immediately infectother programs, or it may load itself into RAM and continue spreading.andP;  Ifthe virus can infect a file that will be used on another system, it hassucceeded.andM;WHAT THEY CAN DOandM;Viruses go through two phases: a replication phase and an action phase.andP;  Theaction doesn't happen until a certain event occurs--perhaps reaching aspecial date or running the virus a certain number of times.andP;  It wouldn'tmake sense for a virus to damage your system the first time it ran; it needssome time to grow and spread first.andM;The most vulnerable spot for a virus attack is your hard disk's fileallocation table (FAT).andP;  This table tells DOS where every file's data resideson the disk.andP;  Without the FAT, the data's still there but DOS can't find it.andO;A virus could also perform a low-level format on some or all tracks of yourhard disk, erase all files, or change the CMOS memory on AT-class computersso that they don't recognize the hard disk.andP;  Most of the dangers involve dataonly, but it's even possible to burn out a monochrome monitor with the rightcode.andM;Some virus assaults are quite subtle.andP;  One known virus finds four consecutivedigits on the screen and switches two.andP;  Let's hope you're not balancing thecompany's books when this one hits.andP;  Others slow down system operations orintroduce spurious errors.andM;VIRUSES UNDER EVERY BEDandM;The CMI disk drives in IBM's first AT computers had an amazing failure rate.andO;It wasn't a matter of whether your particular disk would fail, but when.andO;When it finally did break down, you sighed and replaced it.andP;  These days,though, you'd probably assume that a virus caused the problem.andP;  Operatorserrors, program bugs, and hardware glitches cause many more problems thanviruses do--in fact, you'll probably never see a virus--but a failed harddisk isn't fron-page news.andM;Many of the media's virus stories have warned against software downloadedfrom BBSs (bulletin board systems).andP;  In theory it does sound dangerous to useprograms whose source is unknown, but as PC Magazine editor-in-chief andpublisher Bill Machrone points out, &quot;All major viruses to date weretransmitted by commercial packages and private mail systems.&quot;andP;  Just becauseyou open the shrink-wrapped package yourself doesn't mean the program issafe: some companies routinely repack and rewrap returned program disks.andM;WHAT CAN YOU DO?andM;There are a number of simple things you can do to protect your system, someof which are detailed in the sidebar &quot;Ten Simple Steps to Virus Protection.&quot;andO;For active protection, consider installing one of the antivirus productsreviewed here.andP;  These programs perform one or more of the followingfunctions: prevention, detection, vaccination, identification, and damagecontrol.andP;  The functions overlap somewhat, and most product perform several.andM;* Prevention products keep the virus from infecting your system in the firstplace.andP;  They forbid changes to executable files so the virus can't get afoothold.andP;  Some refuse to let any program make itself resident in RAM unlessyou've approved it.andP;  Others don't allow you to run any program unless it's ona list of approved and tested applications.andP;  Most of the programs we chose toevaluate come from this category because these products seem to offer thebest frontline protection.andM;* Detection products warn you after a virus infection--they watch for viruseffects.andP;  These products check your executable files, boot sector, and so on,and compare them with a previously recorded signature.andP;  This signature iscreated by feeding every byte of the file into a (usually secret) algorithmthat yields a large number.andP;  The probability that anyone could change theprogram without changing the signature is infinitesimal.andP;  Some products checkthe signatures of all files at once, while others check each program as yourun it.andM;* A vaccination product actually &quot;injects&quot; itself into each of yourexecutable programs.andP;  In a sense, it's like a benign virus.andP;  When thevaccinated program starts, the injected code performs a signature check andwarns if there have been any changes.andP;  Unfortunately, by the time you get thewarning, the file has already been infected and the virus code has alreadyexecuted.andP;  And if the program performs its own internal integrity checking,the vaccine will set off alarms.andM;* Identification.andP;  Some antivirus programs try to identify known viruses bylooking for specific byte patterns.andP;  This isn't a very practical method, as atiny change to the virus code can defeat it.andP;  But in conjunction with othermethods it couldn't hurt.andP;  Many BBSs offer programs than scan files forstrings of ASCII characters and display them.andP;  If the search turns up lineslike &quot;Arf!andP;  Arf!andP;  Gotcha!&quot; you can avoid running that program.andM;* Damage control.andP;  Any antivirus program you choose should offer damagecontrol, both preventative and restorative.andP;  Preventative techniques includestopping attempts at direct disk access, warning about programs thatunexpectedly insert RAM-resident code into memory, even &quot;write-protecting&quot;your hard disk while you test unfamiliar software.andP;  If worst comes to worstand your disk is formatted by a virus, you may be able to reverse the damageif your antivirus program maintains a copy of the FAT.andP;  Unless the virus hascompleted a low-level format, your data is still there.andM;Besides these standard protective measures, some antivirus programs offerrelated helpful features.andP;  If the program saves a copy of your CMOS memory,you can probably use it to restore your setup after the battery goes dead.andO;When you accidentally start to copy one executable file over another of thesame name, the antivirus program may warn you.andP;  There's a flip side, though.andO;Your antivirus program may refuse to let you run those applications thatstore default values by changing the program file, and most antivirusprograms will object if you attempt to use a low-level disk editor such asThe Norton Utilities or Mace Utilities.andM;VIRUSES AND OS/2andM;It's too early to know whether viruses will flourish or founder under OS/2.andO;As of this writing, no OS/2-based viruses have been found.andP;  Our own OS/2experts agree that it will be more difficult to write an OS/2 virus, but itwill also be more difficult to write an OS/2-based antivirus program.andP;  SomeOS/2 features do, however, provide ammunitions for the antivirus arsenal.andO;For example, since OS/2 permits multiple threads to run concurrently, youcould have a program continuously working to compare your executable fileswith their signatures.andM;WHERE VIRUSES COME FROMandM;Who writes viruses?andP;  In some case they are merely experimenters with moreskill than sense.andP;  One well-known Macintosh virus did nothign but display a&quot;peace message&quot; on a given day.andP;  The authors of the Pakistani-Brain virusinfected bootleg disks that they sold to foreigners in an act of twistedrighteousness.andP;  And if we're to believe the media, the Internet virus broughtdown a nationwide mainframe system simply because its author didn't realizehow fast it would spread.andM;Our tests show that antivirus programs are far from foolproof, but to anyoneliving in fear of viruses, every little bit helps.andP;  After all, the reallynasty viruses are the work of terrorists.andP;  If someone lobs a bomb into youroffice and destroys your records, is it so different from having those samerecords destroyed by a virus attack?andP;  Neither event is very likely, but ifyou had a program that might keep that bomb from coming through your window,you'd use it, and you'd hope it works.andM;EDITOR'SandM;CHOICE * Flu_Shot+ * CertusandM;Our testing proved that no single program can deliver 100-percent protectionfrom virus attacks on your machine, but many put up lines of defense that cando some good and even save you from your own mistakes.andP;  You certainly can'tgo wrong investing $10 in a copy of Flu_Shot+.andP;  It's as complete andeffective as other, more-expensive programs in a category of software wheremore money doesn't necessarily buy you more functionality.andM;At the other end of the spectrum is Certus, a $189 program that performedabove average in testing and offers virus protection as but one of 34utilities designed to keep your system safe from a variety of attacks,disasters, and acts of foul play.andM;TEN SIMPLE STEPS TO VIRUS PROTECTIONandM;1.andP;  first and always: make frequent backup!andP;  One set is not enough--useseveral sets of backups in rotation, perhaps one for each day of the week.andO;Setting up a regular backup system will help you recover from hard diskcrashes, accidental formatting, and malicious programs.andP;  You're a lot morelikely to suffer a hard disk crash than a virus attack; backups will helpprotect you from both.andM;2.andP;  If you determine conclusively that a virus has infected your system anddestroyed data, you can probably recover the information by using a recentbackup.andP;  Shut off the system, then boot it from your original DOS disk (witha write-protect tab on it).andP;  Format the hard disk using FORMAT.COM from theoriginal DOS disk and do a selective RESTORE.andP;  You should restore only thedata from your backups.andP;  To put your programs back, get the original disksdown off your book-shelf and reinstall them.andM;3.andP;  Always put write-protect tabs on floppy disks that don't need datawritten to them.andP;  If you get a &quot;Write protect error writing drive A:&quot;unexpectedly, something improper is going on.andM;4.andP;  Software downloaded from bulletin board systems hasn't been implicated ina major virus outbreak--yet.andP;  Nevertheless, there are steps you can take tobe doubly safe.andP;  Use established BBSs in which the sysops check the softwarethey post.andP;  If the sysop makes a point of getting programs directly fromauthors, that's even better.andP;  Wait several weeks before downloading a newprogram to see if any problems are surfacing.andM;5.andP;  Make all of your .COM and .EXE files read-only.andP;  Under DOS 3.3, you cando this with just two calls to ATTRIB, one for .COM and one for .EXE.andP;  Fromthe root directory, enter the command ATTRIB +R *.COM /S.andP;  The /S switchcauses ATTRIB to execute the command in all subdirectories.andP;  Do the same for.EXE files.andP;  If your DOS version is pre-3.3, you'll have to either manuallyrun ATTRIB in every directory or use a utility like PC Magazine's SWEEP.COM.andM;6.andP;  Move COMMAND.COM out of the root directory.andP;  Edit your CONFIG.SYS toinclude a line like SHELL=C: \HIDDEN\COMMAND.COM /P replacing HIDDEN withwhatever directory you choose to keep it in.andP;  Add the line SET COMSPEC=C:\HIDDEN\COMMAND.COM to your AUTOEXEC.BAT.andP;  You can even hide COMMAND.COM andthe directory it's in by using PC Magazine's ATTR.COM.andM;7.andP;  Don't loan out program disk--they may come back infected.andP;  If you have alegitimate reason to loan a disk, make a DISKCOPY and format the disk whenyou get it back.andM;8.andP;  On a floppy disk drive system, use only one boot disk.andP;  Write-protect itand never boot from any other.andP;  If you have a hard disk, never boot from afloppy.andM;9.andP;  Don't let anyone else use your system.andP;  If that's not feasible, at leastdon't let them bring their own program disks.andM;10.andP;  Don't use illegal copies of programs that have been &quot;hacked&quot; to removecopy protection.andP;  In one instance, a hacked version of a game programcontained destructive code that was triggered by winning the game.andM;Performance Tests:andM;Virus Protection SoftwareandM;All the packages we tested were monitoring programs, which are installed andremain in memory to monitor operations.andM;For testing with the Lehigh Virus, Certus, Dr.andP;  Panda Utilities, Flu_Shot+,Mace Vaccine, and Vaccine were deemed effective.andP;  In reality, none of thesepackages are 100 percent effective in preventing a diskette-spread infectionsince they operate on the hard disk and--except for SoftSafe--cannot preventinfection incurred from booting with a floppy disk.andP;  Your best protectionfrom this type of virus is never to boot from a floppy.andM;The packages that were effective against the Lehigh virus detected theexecution of a changed file.andP;  This means they all kept some type offile-checking or statistics records.andP;  Certus and Mace Vaccine stoppedoperation once the infected COMMAND.COM was discovered, and SoftSafe wouldnot allow access to C: from a floppy boot.andP;  Vaccine indicated thatCOMMAND.COM was modified, but its Checkup utility did not indicate that avirus was the culprit.andP;  Dr.andP;  Panda Utilities and Flu_Shot+ displayed messageswhen the tampered COMMAND.COM was run.andP;  Although C-4 did not pass our testingusing its TSR Mode, a separate command-line utility, C4ADD, did detect andcorrect the infected COMMAND.COM.andM;Software that was effective against the TSR virus was judged on two fronts.andO;The first question was, &quot;Did the package notify the user of the virus orprevent it from going TSR?&quot;andP;  To detect the virus, antivirus packagesmonitored TSR activity.andP;  C-4, Dr.andP;  Panda Utilities, Flu_Shot+, Virusafe, andVir-X were considered effective.andP;  Disk Watcher gave a &quot;Bad command orfilename&quot; message when the infected program was run, and the TREE.COM filewas erased from the disk.andP;  Dr.andP;  Panda was effective against the virus goingTSR, but only a boot-up or on request.andM;Second, we asked, &quot;Did the package notify the user that a modified programwas running?&quot;andP;  This question actually tests for the presence or absence ofsignature checking or integrity statistics that the software maintains on agiven file.andP;  Certus, Dr.andP;  Panda, Flu_Shot+, Vaccine, Virus Guard, and Vir-Xall used this  feature.andM;For the KILLER virus, no packages prevented infection of .COM files, and nonecaught the Trojan horse component.andP;  Nevertheless, Certus, Disk Watcher, andVirus Guard demonstrated partial effectiveness against the virus infecting.andO;COM files (but not the Trojan horse component) by indicating that a changedfile was being run.andP;  Vaccine did not catch the modified file, but it diddetect NOVIRUS when it disinfect the files.andM;Our reviewers were sequestered in a special part of the PC Labs facility.andO;Four 8-MHz IBM PC ATs with 30MB hard disks and 640K RAM were set up in thisroom.andP;  All hard disks were freshly formatted (low- and high-level) prior totesting each virus.andP;  Testing began with two known viruses (Lehigh and TSR),and one written by PC Labs (KILLER).andP;  We also ran a virus simulator thatchecks for protection of certain interrupts and I/O functions.andP;  The resultsof the virus simulator appear within the reviews, where relevant.andM;LEHIGH VIRUSandM;This virus embeds code in COMMAND.COM.andP;  (Lehigh also has Trojan horsecomponent and a FAT-destroying ability that we did not test.)andM;We began by loading the antivirus program and then booting the AT from awrite-protected IBM PC DOS 3.3 diskette.andP;  Next we entered a SYS C: commandfrom the A: drive, copied COMMAND.COM from a: to C:, and recorded its date,time, and file size.andP;  We then rebooted the system with a Lehigh-infecteddiskette.andP;  To activate the Lehigh virus, we ran a DOS DIR command of the rootdirectory on the hard disk.andP;  If COMMAND.COM had changed, the infection hadbegun.andM;At this point, we tested the antivirus program.andP;  Programs having checksum orintegrity-statistics checking were expected to alert the user to themodification of COMMAND.COM.andM;TSR VIRUSandM;This virus (also known as the Israeli virus, after the place where it wasdiscovered) alters.andP;  COM files so that they becometerminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs when executed.andM;Each reviewer created a directory on C: and copied the virus and test .COMfiles to that directory.andP;  We then entered a DIR *.COM command and recordedthe dates, times, and sizes of the .COM files.andM;At this point we activated the antivirus program, which was optimized toprotect .COM files.andP;  We were especially interested in TREE.COM, the file tobe infected by the TSR virus.andM;We then activated the virus.andP;  This virus is itself a TSR, and an antivirusprogram sensitive to TSRs should have sounded and alarm.andP;  Next we executedTREE.COM, causing the copy of TREE.COM on-disk to become infected.andP;  Theantivirus program should have warned of an attempt to alter the TREE.COMfile.andP;  We executed DIR *.COM and recorded the dates, times, and sizes of the.COM files, verified that TREE.COM had changed, and noted if the antivirusprogram had displayed any messages.andM;Then we ran TREE.COM again.andP;  If the antivirus program had checksum orsignature-verification abilities, it should have indicated that we wereattempting to execute a modified copy of TREE.COM.andP;  This activity was notedas well.andP;  Effective programs detected TREE.COM going TSR, or the running of amodified program.andM;KILLER VIRUSandM;This virus, created by PC Labs for test purposes, infects .COM files.andP;  Italso has a Trojan horse component activated by a system date of Friday the13th.andP;  When activated, the Trojan horse function reverses the case of lettersin the file VIRUS.TST, changing uppercase letters to lowercase and lowercaseletters to uppercase.andP;  Two utility programs (both of which are .COM files)were also written: VIR_CHK, which determines if a .COM file has been infectedby KILLER, and NOVIRUS, which disinfects and restores the KILLER-infected.COM files.andM;Each reviewer created a directory on C: and copied the KILLER virus, VR_CHK,NOVIRUS, and several .COM files into that directory.andP;  We then entered DIR*.COM and noted the sizes of the .COM files.andM;We installed and activated the antivirus program with optimizations set toprotect .COM files, if applicable.andP;  We ran VIR_CHK to ensure that onlyVIRUS.TST itself was infected and then activated KILLER, noting any messagedisplayed by the antivirus program.andM;KILLER should have infected and added code to all of the uninfected .COMfiles.andP;  We executed a DIR *.COM and noted the sizes of the .COM files, thenran VIR_CHK to verify that all .COM files were now infected.andM;To activate the Trojan horse, we changed the system date to Friday, January13, 1989.andP;  We then executed the now infected VIR_CHK .COM file and executedTYPE VIRUS.TST to verify that the case of the letters in that file had indeedbeen reversed.andP;  We also noted whether the antivirus program gave anynotification of the Trojan horse code.andM;Finally, we executed NOVIRUS to disinfect the .COM files.andP;  At this point, ifthe antivirus program had checksum or signature verification, we notedwhether it displayed a message indicating that the NOVIRUS program had beenaltered since the last checksum was computed.andM;If the antivirus program did not trigger during the execution of KILLER andallowed the .COM files to become infected, it was considered not effective.andO;If the program did not detect the Trojan horse component, it was considerednot effective.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
