(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The federal government wants VirginiaMilitary Institute to admit women, but some cadets said Thursdaythat would destroy a proud 150-year tradition of discipline andunity among the student body.   ``I kind of felt all along it would be inevitable, hoping thatit wouldn't,'' said Tony Marro, 20, of Ilion, N.Y.   The U.S. Justice Department announced Wednesday it would bring asex discrimination lawsuit against VMI if the college _ part of thestate university system _ doesn't agree by Feb. 20 to admit women.   But state Attorney General Mary Sue Terry has said she woulddefend the school if it continues to turn away women.   ``There are viable defenses to VMI's admission policy,'' saidBert Rohrer, a Terry spokesman. ``If they chose to continue thepolicy, she would defend it.''   The Justice Department said its investigation concluded thepolicy violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 14th Amendmentto the Constitution, which guarantees every citizen equalprotection under the law.   The investigation was prompted by a written complaint in Marchfrom a female high school student who wanted to attend the college,known for the military-style discipline of its uniformed``cadets,'' though it isn't part of the military.   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder refused to say whether he supportsadmitting women to VMI.   ``The ultimate responsibility as to what takes place rests withthe board of visitors,'' Wilder said, referring to the school'sappointed governing body.   The VMI board of visitors' next scheduled meeting is March29-31, well after the Justice Department deadline, said Tom Joynes,the school's public affairs officer. No special meeting has beenscheduled, Joynes said.   VMI officials said it would be inappropriate to comment aboutthe federal government's action and referred all questions toTerry's office.   The school reaffirmed its single-sex policy in 1986 and told theJustice Department in April that coeducation would undermine itsmission. But most cadets oppose the admission of women, saidBenjamin Dorman, a 20-year-old cadet.   ``The system functions better with men only. To allow womenwould cause too many changes,'' he said. ``I don't think they couldcut it, physically.''   But Dorman, like many of the other cadets, believe the campuswill soon be coeducational.   ``I just got clobbered by my roommates for saying what Ithink,'' said Jim Blankenship, a 19-year-old sophomore fromRoanoke. ``I think women should come.''   But another cadet overheard the comment and yelled as he walkedaway, ``Maybe I should buy you a skirt, Blankenship.''   The 1,200-student college in Virginia's western mountains, whichoffers bachelor's degrees and is known for its engineering program,is one of just two state-supported all-male military schools leftin the country. The other is the Citadel in South Carolina.   As at military prep schools, cadets wear military-styleuniforms, and many join the service after graduation. The schools,supporters say, instill discipline, pride and self-reliance, andforge bonds among the cadets.   All of VMI's cadets live in a three-story dormitory in spartanrooms with standard cots, shelves and desks. They wake to reveilleand the freshmen, called ``rats'' by upperclassmen, have to keeptheir heads shaved and be ready at any time for inspections.   Marro said the unity would suffer if women are admitted.   ``The whole system takes place in the barracks,'' he said. ``Thething with rats coming together as a class, I think that would beaffected. If they build a separate barracks for women it will behard to maintain unity.''   Meantime, state Sen. Emilie F. Miller has introduced a bill inthe General Assembly that would force VMI to admit women.   ``I would hope that the state would not go to court, that wewould do the right thing,'' she said.   But Sen. Elmon T. Gray, D-Waverly and a VMI graduate, said thestate should fight the Justice Department. ``I've never felt VMI isin violation,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
