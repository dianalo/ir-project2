Peacekeeping Force For Region</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Central American officials this week willdiscuss plans for a U.N. peacekeeping force to patrol theNicaraguan-Honduran border and other regional hot spots, diplomatssaid Monday.   The U.N. plan envisions the peacekeepers using speedboats,all-terrain vehicles and helicopters to monitor allegations ofsubversion in the region.   Foreign ministry officials and military officers from Nicaragua,El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala will meet Tuesdayand Wednesday at U.N. headquarters to discuss the details, accordingto U.N. diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Foreign Ministry officials from the five Central American nationsagreed in principle in February that a U.N. military observer groupshould check claims that any of the nations is violating another.   The peacekeepers will focus on the Nicaragua-Honduras border tocheck allegations of raids by the Contras or Sandinistas, and on theEl Salvador-Honduras border, said the diplomats.   El Salvador says rebels trying to overthrow the governmentoperate from clandestine bases in Honduras without the knowledge ofHonduran officials.   About 11,000 Nicaraguan rebels are based in Honduras.   The peacekeepers will also monitor the Costa Rica-Nicaraguaborder and will use speedboats to patrol the Gulf of Fonseca, whichlinks Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador on their Pacific coasts,according to a copy of the U.N. draft plan obtained by TheAssociated Press.   Each roving team will consist of four military observers in twovehicles, with at least one group in each of the five nations.   The U.N. plan says they will need all-terrain vehicles,helicopters and a light airplane, as well as at least one speedboat.   About 60 pilots, drivers and civilian support staff will bedeployed along with up to 100 military observers, the reportrecommends.   Canada, Spain and West Germany have already volunteered toprovide personnel for the force.   Unresolved are the issues of whether the military observers wouldhave any weapons other than their standard light side arms fordefensive use, and exactly where they will be posted, said thediplomats.   The draft report calls for the Central American governments toconsider providing armed escorts for the peacekeepers when necessary.   It also asks the governments to try to reach agreements with thelocal rebel forces that the insurgents will not fire on the U.N.peacekeepers.   The military observers would not attempt to clean out or relocateContra bases in Honduras unless the Contras invited them to assistin their repatriation, the diplomats said.</TEXT></DOC>
