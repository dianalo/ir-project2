But now, ironically, Mr. Ortega's hardline behavior may save Managua's enemy, the U.S.-backed Contras.    Senior American officials concede that as long as the Central American peace plan appears to be on track, there is little likelihood that Congress will provide the military aid that has allowed the Contras to keep battling Mr. Ortega's government. The peace plan, announced in August in Guatemala, provided the perfect political cover for U.S. legislators who want to avoid a vote on the controversial aid program, particularly with an election year approaching.    But last week, Managua made defiant statements that could lift that cover and change the political picture in the U.S. The Ortega government said it won't lift a state of emergency or implement the peace plan's broad amnesty for prisoners unless the U.S. cuts its links with the rebels first. If Nicaragua holds to that position, even the staunchest foes of Contra aid agree that the pressure could increase for the Congress to extend some aid to the rebels.    Congress almost certainly would change its mind if President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, the author of the peace plan, denounces Managua. &quot;That would revive the chances of military aid to the Contras,&quot; said Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D., Conn.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, who opposes aid to the rebels. Such a denunciation also would prompt so-called swing voters on the issue to approve Contra aid, added a spokesman for Rep. Dave McCurdy (D., Ok.), a member of that group.    Guido Fernandez, Costa Rica's ambassador to the U.S., said in an interview Friday that President Arias intends to keep the pressure on Managua. &quot;I have no doubt that Arias will be the first one to stand up and say they haven't complied with the agreement,&quot; he said. Indeed, Mr. Fernandez said President Arias plans to push for the spirit as well as the letter of the accord. For instance, the pact specifically doesn't require Nicaragua to negotiate with the Contras, but &quot;we see this agreement as the minimum of things we have to do, not the maximum,&quot; he added.    Such resolve suits the Reagan administration. It initially criticized the pact as &quot;fatally flawed&quot;; now, however, its strategy is to encourage this maximalist approach and to avoid its earlier stance of appearing to undercut the agreement.    U.S. officials believe there is growing concern in Managua that the limited steps it has taken toward compliance could unleash a wave of domestic discontent that would be embarassing, or difficult, to suppress. So over the coming weeks, U.S. officials will continue to play a passive role, pointing out what is needed for total compliance. If Managua did meet certain requirements, such as holding either direct or indirect talks with the Contras, then the U.S. would agree to joining regional talks, according to a senior U.S. official.    At the same time, the administration won't provide either Nicaragua or its congressional critics with the opportunity to charge that it is Washington that wants to scuttle the agreement. Thus the administration has postponed -- first from September to November, and now until January -- requesting an aid package of $270 million for the rebels.    U.S. officials say there is enough military aid in the pipeline to keep the Contras supplied until mid-January. Further, Congress last month approved a 30-day supply of non-lethal aid for the rebels, and is widely expected to do so again.    But it isn't clear whether this low-key strategy will succeed. Compliance with the peace plan may be neither as complete as proponents demand nor as inadequate as U.S. officials hope. Some critics say ambiguity serves Mr. Ortega, who wants to buy time, Mr. Arias, who will be reluctant to declare a failure the plan that won him the Nobel Peace Prize, and the U.S. Congress, which doesn't want to vote on Contra aid.    Indeed, although the plan is supposed to be implemented Thursday, most participants say the crucial date is Jan. 5, when Central American leaders will convene to evaluate their work.    &quot;It's in everybody's interest to keep it obscure,&quot; said Robert Leiken, a visiting scholar at Harvard University's Center for International Affairs and a Contra supporter. &quot;There's enough inertia here so that things can remain smokey and murky.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Sandinistas' Defiance Shatters Dream of Central American 'Peace Week'&quot;... -- WSJ Nov. 2, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
