But when you look at the sky and thereare no clouds, you know what it is,'' said Iqbal Akhmed.   ``And you know they're out there, just waiting,'' the 38-year-oldantiques dealer said, pointing at the mountains.   The mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, are hiding in themountains about 10 miles away, just beyond the ridges that ring thiscity of 2.25 million people.   Since the final pullout of Soviet troops on Feb. 15, theguerrillas have been saying a full-scale attack on Kabul isimminent. But if they carry through with their threat, they willface powerful air and land defenses capable of resisting asubstantial offensive.   In a military emergency, the government can put 200,000 armed menand women into battle against the guerrillas. This includes theelite 16,000-man Presidential Guard and 20,000 armed civiliansfiercely loyal to the ruling People's Democratic Party ofAfghanistan.   ``I can assure that Kabul is well-defended,'' said the mayor,Gen. Mohammad Hakim. ``This is no hollow claim.''   Rebel commanders in the frontier city of Peshawar, Pakistan, saythey are mobilizing 20,000 fighters and readying them for action.   U.S.-supplied weapons are loaded on colorfully painted trucks,captured Soviet jeeps or donkeys and hauled from Pakistan, on narrowdirt roads that crisscross the rebel-controlled countryside and overmountains toward Kabul.   ``Some pressure has got to be brought on the government,'' saidMohammad Ishaq, a Peshawar-based spokesman for Hezb-e-Islami,believed to be the strongest of the guerrilla groups around Kabul.   But guerrilla leaders and field commanders appear divided abouttheir strategy, fearing a repeat of the March offensive on theprovincial capital of Jalalabad, about 75 miles east of Kabul.   The country's fifth-largest city, Jalalabad was the guerrillas'first major target after the Soviet troops left Afghanistan. Theinsurgents had predicted the city would fall within three days, butthey have so far failed in their assault on President Najib'swell-equipped and dug-in forces.   ``In Kabul, the mujahedeen want to go step-by-step and not facethe problems they faced in Jalalabad,'' said Mohammad Shoaib, aPeshawar-based spokeman for the Jamiat-e-Islami rebel group.   Foreign military experts in Kabul say any attack on the capitalwould require a major effort in manpower and fire support as well asa unified command structure and coordination by the already dividedguerrilla alliance.   ``We do not think that the rebels have such capabilities, atleast they have not shown that they possess such capability in thebattle for Jalalabad,'' said an Asian defense expert, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   ``The only option before the mujahedeen is to carry outlarge-scale sabotage and create a fear psychosis and then during theconfusion, aim to launch a physical attack,'' he said.   The Afghan army has divided Kabul into three sectors. Thenorthern district is defended by regular army units. The easterndistrict is under the command of the Sarandoy, or state police.   The western and southern districts, which have been linked as onesecurity zone, are under the Afghan secret police, known as KHAD.   While the hills that surround Kabul provide cover for theguerrillas, they also are a strategic advantage for the government.Defense posts dotting the hills can detect advancing rebel groupsand pound them with artillery fire.   The army also has 122mm rockets to bombard rebel-held points andconverted Soviet-made transport planes that can drop bombs from wellabove the range of the rebels' American-made Stinger anti-aircraftmissiles.   Although the Soviet troops are gone, the Kremlin still sendsdozens of giant military transport planes to Kabul every day withweapons and ammunition.   The rebels refuse to be tied to deadlines but say they won't waituntil next year to launch an attack.   ``We're not willing to postpone it that long, but it is hard topredict from day to day. It takes time,'' said Abdul HaidiArghandehwal, a spokesman for fundamentalist guerrilla leaderGulbaddin Hekmatyar.   Arghandehwal said the guerrillas plan to concentrate on theperimeter defense posts and roads around Kabul and will try toinfiltrate into the city, mobilizing the people and generating massprotests to undermine Najib's government.</TEXT></DOC>
