SEC project director John O.andO;Penhollow said at a recent public meeting.andP;  &quot;This will be testing only, nolive filers.andP;  We're testing only to help us shake the system down.&quot;andM;The SEC has been working on the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis andRetrieval system for more than six years.andP;  Known as EDGAR, the system willreplace the manual filing of financial information that businesses arerequired to submit to the SEC.andM;Like a hot rod revving on the tarmac before a big race, EDGAR is waiting forcode, testing and rule-making before it can take off.andP;  BDM International ofMcLean, Va., won the $52 million EDGAR contract in January 1989.andM;SEC and BDM officials acknowledged that unforeseen problems in system andsoftware development, installation, testing or rule-making all could delayEDGAR's implementation.andM;But Penhollow said he is confident the agency can have all filers on line bymid- to late 1994.andP;  SEC intends to bring the first group of EDGAR filers --users of its 5-year-old pilot program -- on line in August 1991, he said.andM;The core processors for EDGAR, four fault-tolerant high-end Stratus XA2000Model 130 mainframes, are in place at SEC headquarters in Washington, as wellas a fifth at Mead Data Central Inc. in Dayton, Ohio.andM;BDM has installed 800 dial-up lines for filers to access EDGAR.andP;  One hundredare operational; more will be activated as filers come on line.andM;BDM has provided 20 ports for high-speed dedicated lines.andP;  Fourteen companieshave reserved 17 of those lines, and the SEC may ask for more dedicated lineports.andP;  The company also has installed a local area network in SECheadquarters, with an optical fiber backbone, and 369 Hewlett Packard 386Vectra workstations are in place.andP;  BDM has installed a wide area network aswell that connects the SEC's 12 regional offices across the country to theLAN.andM;Final TouchesandM;Now, SEC and BDM officials are programming the code for the communicationssoftware and finalizing hardware design.andM;More than 45 SEC employees can use the LAN to review filings.andP;  Also throughthe LAN, eight SEC examiners working on the pilot, which resides on an IBM3090 mainframe, can interface with EDGAR.andM;A key element still in development is EDGARLink, the free MS-DOScommunications software that will allow filers to transmit documents viapersonal computer modems.andM;&quot;You can expect it to run on almost any plain vanilla PC,&quot; said Tom Woteki,BDM's chief engineer and deputy program manager for EDGAR.andM;If companies want to develop their own software, the SEC will provide theEDGARLink source code.andM;EDGARLink will prevalidate the filing, check for technical errors, handlepartial filings, provide for boilerplate information that companies referencein numerous filings and, if a transmission is halted, send a file from thepoint it left off.andM;EDGARLink cannot check for improperly entered company codes, fee problems orother database information, but the software should catch a lot of glitches,Woteki said.andM;The SEC will start phasing in the first mandated group of filers, mostlylarge companies, late next year.andP;  That group of roughly 2,500 filers will usethe system for six months to ensure EDGAR is glitch-free, Penhollow said.andO;Congress required this six-month insurance phase in the 1987 EDGARAuthorization Act.andM;The SEC then would bring filers on line over a two-year period in six toeight groups of 1,500 filers each.andP;  Initially, the SEC had planned largergroups of 2,500, but the training experience with pilot users led SECofficials to reduce the size of these groups, Penhollow said.andP;  The SECexpects eventually to have 15,000 filers.andM;Coupled with the installation process is the SEC internal rule-makingmechanism.andP;  The EDGAR regulations must be drafted, opened to comment,finalized, approved and issued in tandem with EDGAR's implementation.andM;EDGAR resides on a pair of the Stratus mainframes and is composed of threemajor subsystems: the Receipt and Acceptance Subsystem, the Analysis andReview Subsystem, and the Dissemination Subsystem.andP;  The government is fundingthe first two portions, while Mead will finance the third.andM;Because Mead agreed to undertake all dissemination costs, company officialsopted to phase in dissemination services as EDGAR data becomes available,Mead spokesman Jim McGrane said.andM;&quot;We're waiting until the point where there's enough live data available forsubscribers,&quot; he said.andM;Mead expects most EDGAR subscribers will want to wait until they can accessthe widest variety of information, he said.andP;  Mead will begin offering limitedsubscriptions in 1991, but the full range of services, from overnightmagnetic tape delivery to real-time PC access, will not be available before1994.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
