Postal clerks, mail sorters, and other indoor workers failed to report for the first workturn in Victoria, British Columbia, but showed up for the balance of the day. In Montreal, inside postal workers voted to stay off the job until a settlement is reached, in defiance of the union leadership's plan for rotating strikes.    Canada Post Corp., the government-owned postal agency, said temporary workers replaced the strikers. The union wouldn't say which cities would be hit next by strikes.    Last night, Jean-Claude Parrot, president of the union, submitted a counter-offer to Canada Post's management in response to the agency's most recent contract proposal. Mr. Parrot declined to disclose the counter-offer's contents.    This is the second disruption of Canada's postal service in three months. The Canadian Letter Carriers' Union engaged in rotating strikes for three weeks in June and July before signing a 31-month contract with Canada Post.    In the current dispute, the main unresolved issue is job security. The union is opposed to the agency's plans to franchise some of its operations to private industry and increase its use of part-time staff.    The federal government appointed a senior labor official to meet with union and management representatives and assess whether a settlement could be negotiated. Harold Dunstan, labor relations manager for Canada Post, has said that back-to-work legislation is a possibility, although he doesn't favor such a measure. </TEXT></DOC>
