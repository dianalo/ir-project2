Fluor, an engineering, construction and natural resources management concern, said it sold the assets of its South African business to an independent trust that is free to continue to use the Fluor name. It said that operations there &quot;will be directed by current local management, enabling continued employment for the racially integrated workforce&quot; there.    A Fluor spokesman said the company will continue to have about 30 employees doing service work in South Africa under existing contracts. There is nothing to prohibit Fluor from continuing to employ those workers in South Africa, he said. Prior to the sale of the business there, Fluor had between 1,300 and 1,400 hourly and salaried workers in the country, the spokesman said.    Fluor said that while it continues to oppose enactment of sanctions against South Africa and the pullout of U.S. companies as ineffective ways to end apartheid, the company has &quot;reached the point . . . where an orderly transfer of ownership is in the best interests of the corporation, its employees, shareholders and clients.&quot; Fluor has an option to repurchase the business, although it couldn't do so unless current regulations were revised to permit new investments in South Africa, the spokesman said.    The Fluor spokesman said the anti-apartheid measures adopted by various municipalities were &quot;certainly one consideration&quot; in Fluor's decision to sell its South African operations. He said less-severe federal sanctions &quot;didn't dictate this action.&quot;    Fluor said its South African operations accounted for less than 0.5% of total revenue, which in 1985 was $4.17 billion.    A European trust company that Fluor declined to identify purchased the South African operations, the Fluor spokesman said. He declined to disclose the purchase price but said it was &quot;immaterial compared to our total asset base.&quot;    In August, the Los Angeles Convention and Exhibition Center Authority rejected Fluor for a $310 million construction-management contract after the city council had adopted an anti-apartheid ordinance. A spokeswoman for the agency, which had judged Fluor's offer as superior to competitors' bids, said another contractor already has been selected for the job. </TEXT></DOC>
