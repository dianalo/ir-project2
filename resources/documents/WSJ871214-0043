The No. 1 auto maker told its more than 100,000 salaried workers Friday it was creating a new fund in 1988 for &quot;recognition awards.&quot; The payments, which will total 3.5% of GM's salaried payroll, &quot;are designed to enhance GM's competitive position by utilizing a variable element of compensation to reward and encourage individual and team accomplishments,&quot; the company said.    GM also will give white-collar workers lump-sum payments for merit pay. That fund will total 2.5% of GM's salaried payroll, down from 3.5% for 1987. It wasn't clear what the differences between the two funds would be.    GM also told employees it is making several changes in health-care benefits. Among them, it will require employees to pay deductibles and co-payments if they use a traditional health-insurance plan. Payments won't be increased for employees using other health-care plans, such as health-maintenance organizations. The reason is &quot;to help reduce GM's increasing health-care costs by motivating salaried employees to move into managed-care options.&quot;    Changes were also made to adapt certain parts of the company's recently signed contract with the United Auto Workers union to the nonunionized salaried work force. For example, the profit-sharing formula was sweetened. </TEXT></DOC>
