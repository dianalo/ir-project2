And they aren't alone.   For Pete du Pont, Bruce Babbitt, Gary Hart and maybe even PaulSimon, Tuesday's elections shape up as a do-or-die test of theirability to stay alive in the 1988 presidential campaign.   ``New Hampshire has within its grasp the power of life or deathover my candidacy,'' said Babbitt, who fashions himself the lasthonest man among the dirty dozen who have outlasted Alexander Haigon the campaign trail.   The tension is highest among the Republicans, where the Reaganrevolution may ride on the coattails of Bush and Kemp in their raceagainst Bob Dole, Pat Robertson and Pete du Pont.   For just as surely as 12-year-old Robyn Perry carried the torchto begin the XV Winter Olympics, Bush and Kemp carry the torch forthe silent, retiring fellow who'll be sitting by the fire in SantaBarbara.   Vice President Bush, who held a huge lead in the New Hampshirepolls until he lost Iowa in such embarrassing fashion, wrappedhimself in the presidency throughout Sunday night's debate. At onepoint he went so far as to defend the State Department _ the StateDepartment! _ to punctuate the extent to which he hopes voters willput their trust in Reaganism.   Bush must win _ that is, come in first _ Tuesday or hope Reaganwill drop his neutrality and ride to his rescue. It isn't as ifBush hasn't got a chance. The weekend polls show him in afirst-place duel with Dole and he benefits from new, lowerexpectations which have him fading away to his seaside home inKennebunkport, Me.   Kemp, vowing to ``complete the Reagan revolution,'' worked overthe weekend to impress New Hampshire voters with his pledge not toraise taxes, no matter what. At one point during the day he said,``I am convinced that Sen. Dole has a secret plan to raise taxes onthe American people.''   Kemp can kick around Bob Dole all he likes but the Dole-Bushstruggle is irrelevant, for now, to his bid for survival. Heenjoyed strong poll figures on Iowa eve, but his standing asconservative challenger to the front-runners is now being blockedby the emergence of Pat Robertson.   Kemp said Sunday he'll beat Robertson because ``the people ofNew Hampshire want a conservative who can reach out beyond just onesegment of the population and win.'' Forgotten for the moment is duPont, who hopes to sneak up on everyone Tuesday and live to fightanother day. So far he has amassed respect but not much support.   If Bush beats Dole, or Kemp beats Robertson, the topsy turvy GOPcampaign will be topsy again. It's a little known secret, but theother party, the Democrats, are also holding a presidential primaryTuesday in New Hampshire.   Michael Dukakis has to win big and he probably will, getting anhonorable boost as it occurs to people that he handled thespotlight nicely and knows the issues better than hisWashington-based opponents like to let on.   The Massachusetts governor already has set up shop in the Southand in Minnesota (caucuses a week from tomorrow) _ keenly awarethat the Massachusetts and Rhode Island primaries give him aspearhead on Super Tuesday (20 states, March 8) that none of hisopponents can easily match.   Richard Gephardt is slugging it out for second place with Simon.It's remarkable that Simon is still in the hunt after half-a-dozenor so lackluster debates, but he touches a tender nerve among partyliberals and Gephardt has had trouble answering some of Simon'snegative ads which imply he isn't trustworthy. If the Missouricongressman becomes ensnarled in the inconsistencies of his votingrecord, Dukakis and Albert Gore Jr. and Jesse Jackson will surelykeep chipping away as the voting shifts South.   ``I hope to do much better than people expect on Tuesday,'' Goresaid during a strong anti-Gephardt performance over the weekend.   Babbitt and Hart trailed the pack in Iowa last week and areexpected to spend their last dollar in futility. Babbitt has wageda human-scale campaign of humor and candor. But as du Pont can tellhim, you can't spend respect _ the former Arizona governor isrunning out of money.   Hart is threatening to go the distance, no matter how pathetichis results may be. But he already has an uncontrollable campaigndebt from 1984 and it's hard to see who'll extend him credit forthe 48 states to come.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Jonathan Wolman is AP's assistant bureau chiefin Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
