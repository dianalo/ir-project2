The organizations hope to head off new legislation inCongress this year that would force auditors to notifyregulators of possible illegal acts by companies. But somemembers of the organizations said they fear the guidelinesare too weak to achieve this goal. Under current rules,auditors who spot illegal acts can inform management and quitthe audit -- but their complaints rarely if ever reach thepublic.</LP><TEXT>   In Washington, D.C., Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who haslong criticized accountants for faulty auditing of financialdata, says he is anxious to see the new guidelines. But hesays he doubts that such guidelines would have helpedregulators give earlier warnings about troubled thrifts andbanks.   Rep. Wyden maintains that one sponsor of the guidelines,the 13,500-member Financial Executives Institute, &quot;is tooanxious to defend the status quo in financial reporting.&quot; Henotes that the FEI sent &quot;a blizzard of letters late last yearto congressmen opposing my bill that would have prevented thesavings and loan debacle.&quot;   Mr. Wyden's bill, which was passed in the House but didn'tget Senate approval, would have required accountants toreport corporate financial fraud to regulators. Mr. Wydensays he will reintroduce the bill in March or April. He sayshe &quot;expects a lot more congressional support&quot; because ofcurrent problems in the banking and insurance industries.   P. Norman Roy, FEI president, says the industry groups'proposal will be issued in March for three months of publiccomment. &quot;I don't agree that it lacks teeth,&quot; Mr. Roy adds.&quot;Its purpose is educational and to help corporations evaluatethe quality of internal controls.&quot;   The guidelines in the 150-page proposal are supposed tohelp auditors and management improve corporateinternal-control systems to safeguard assets and check theaccuracy of financial data. For example, in handling accountsreceivable, the proposal recommends that companies matchorders, shipping documents and invoices and &quot;follow throughon inconsistent information.&quot;   But Robert Weiss, chairman of the management accountingpractices committee of the 96,000-member National Associationof Accountants, another sponsor, says the proposal &quot;reallydoesn't have many strong recommendations.&quot; He adds: &quot;I doubtthat these guidelines in their current form would stop thekind of fraudulent financial reporting that Congressman Wydenhas been talking about.&quot;   Edward Trott, a partner at Peat Marwick, a majoraccounting firm, who has seen the proposal, says that &quot;it'snot as definitive as many people would like to see it.&quot; Mr.Trott says that comments during the comment period may helpstrengthen the proposal.   Some officials of the sponsoring organizations, whorequested anonymity, say that a section of the proposal thatfocused on the fraudulent financial reporting of thrifts andbanks was dropped because of fears that it would only fuelmore litigation against accountants and management oftroubled businesses.   Initially, a research foundation of FEI was supposed toissue the guidelines on internal controls, without publiccomment. But after the guidelines were prepared late lastyear by Coopers andamp; Lybrand, a major accounting firm, followinginterviews with 1,000 accounting and business officials, thefive sponsoring organizations decided to seek comment.Coopers was paid about $500,000 to prepare the proposal.   Besides the Financial Executives Institute and theNational Association of Accountants, the proposal's sponsorsare the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,the Institute of Internal Auditors and the AmericanAccounting Association.</TEXT></DOC>
