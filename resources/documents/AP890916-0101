In the occupied territories, clashes between Palestinian youthsand Israeli soldiers reportedly injured four Arabs, and aPalestinian man shot in a clash with troops last week died of hisinjuries.   Leaders of Israel's two main parties met Saturday to discuss aMiddle East peace plan offered by Egypt. Two meetings last weekfailed to bridge differences over the plan, which calls forIsraeli-Palestinian peace talks.   The border incident occurred in pre-dawn darkness near thecommunal settlement of Ashdot Yakov, three miles south of the Sea ofGalilee.   Israel radio said the assailant apparently was a Jordanian armysoldier who ran to the border and ambushed the Israeli patrol,firing about 30 rounds while hiding behind a bush. The Israelisreturned fire.   A Jordanian army spokesman told Jordan's official news agency,Petra, that a Jordanian soldier fired at an ``unusual movement''along the Jordan River and that ``Israeli patrol cars ... fired inthe same direction and that resulted in a slight injury to one ofour people.''   Another Jordanian official told The Associated Press thefirefight appeared to be ``an accident.''   ``It was night, and when you are on the cease-fire line, (youknow) how alert you are to any unusual movement,'' he said.   The Israeli soldiers suffered slight shrapnel wounds.   It was the sixth attack this year on Israel from along theJordan-Israel border and the third this month. The most recentattack occurred Sept. 7, when several Soviet-designed Katyusharockets were fired from Jordan into Israel. There were no injuries.   In the occupied territories, Palestinians paralyzed the West Bankcity of Nablus with a general strike to protest the deaths Friday oftwo Palestinian youths shot by Israeli troops.   Another Palestinian, 45-year-old Samir al Akhbar, died Saturdayof wounds suffered in a clash with troops last week, officials atAnglican Hospital in Nablus said.   Arab reports said Akhbar was shot in the back while trying tokeep soldiers from beating his son.   Israeli officials said he was shot when he tried to grab asoldier's gun.   His death raised to 571 the number of Palestinians killed inclashes with Israelis in the 21-month-old uprising against Israelirule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Forty Israelis have died, and114 Arabs accused of collaborating with Israel have been killed byother Arabs.   Arab reporters said four Palestinians were wounded in clashesSaturday. The army said it was checking the reports.   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak proposed a 10-point peace planthat includes Palestinian elections in the West Bank and Gaza Stripand Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Cairo that would include twoArabs deported from the occupied lands.   That aspect of the plan is designed to satisfy Israel's demand totalk only to Palestinians from the territories and the PLO'sinsistence that Palestinians living abroad be included in talks.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc and theleft-leaning Labor Party led by Finance Minister Shimon Peres aredeeply divided over the plan.   Labor leaders have indicated their willingness to talk to adelegation including deported Arabs, but Likud officials view it asan attempt to bring in the Palestine Liberation Organization throughthe back door.</TEXT></DOC>
