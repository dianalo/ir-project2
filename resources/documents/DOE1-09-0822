The multiplicity spectrum has been computedfor the case of Pb targets of different sizes at proton energies of 1.5,1.0 and 0.59 GeV using the Monte Carlo code HETC. It is pointed out thata measurement of MS of leakage neutrons can lead to a more accurate determinationof the level density parameters.</TEXT></DOC>
