Petrolane's 10-K filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission repeated earlier company statements that itdoesn't expect to have sufficient cash flow this year toservice its bank debt and make payments to its senior noteholders. Petrolane said its debt service obligations thisyear total about $170 million.</LP><TEXT>   Even though the propane gas company faces a liquiditycrunch, it did make about $25 million in interest payments todebt holders Tuesday, a spokeswoman said.   Petrolane was bought 19 months ago in a $1.2 billionleveraged buy-out by CS First Boston Inc. and QuantumChemical Corp. The brokerage company and the New York propaneand chemical company jointly own 56.2% of Petrolane via QFBPartners, which was formed for that purpose. The twocompanies' combined equity stake in Petrolane at the time ofthe buy-out totaled $180 million, but that has been reduced alot by continued losses at Petrolane.</TEXT></DOC>
