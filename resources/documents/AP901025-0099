In Washington, CIA director William Webster said today theMiddle East will never be secure as long as Saddam Hussein remainsin power - unless the Iraqi president's weapons are destroyed.   Regarding the French hostages, Western diplomatic sources inBaghdad said French citizens given permission this week to departIraq will begin leaving on Saturday. More than 300 French citizensare among the thousands of foreigners who were trapped in Iraqafter the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.   France has said it would not make any concessions in exchangefor the freeing of its nationals, but the Iraqi government-rundaily newspaper Al-Jumhouriya said today that France would withdrawsome of its forces from the Persian Gulf region. It citedunidentified, official sources in Paris.   France has about 5,000 troops in Saudi Arabia, plus an estimated2,000 sailors aboard 14 ships in the region as part of thepredominantly American multinational force.   U.S. military strength in the gulf region, now totaling about220,000 troops, could grow substantially in coming weeks, DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney said today.   ``We're not at the point yet where we want to stop addingforces,'' Cheney said on ``CBS This Morning.'' Asked if adding100,000 troops was possible, he said, ``It's conceivable that we'llend up with that big an increase.''   Congressional sources said Cheney and Secretary of State JamesA. Baker III had disclosed an offer by Iraq to free Canadian andGerman hostages in return for high-level diplomatic visits fromthose countries.   The sources said Cheney and Baker briefed lawmakers in aclosed-door meeting on Wednesday. Saddam invited the Canadian andGerman foreign ministers to visit his country and held out theprospect that some of their nationals could be released if they didso, House members were told.   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., said the reported entreaties to U.S.allies ``are viewed by our guys as cynical, exploitative of thehostages, and I think Congress agrees with that assessment.''   Webster, meanwhile, told the National Council of World AffairsOrganizations that Saddam's ``willingness to use weapons of massdestruction, his ties to terrorist groups, his appeal to Arab andMuslim solidarity and his playing upon regional economicfrustration'' make him a continuing threat to long-term peace inthe gulf region.   The five American men who arrived in the United States onWednesday were freed by Iraq for medical reasons. They arrived atNew York's Kennedy Airport aboard a Royal Jordanian Airlinesflight.   Freed hostage Jack Frazier, 53, of Santa Ana, Calif., saidleaving his fellow hostages behind ``was the hardest thing I'veever done in my life.''   ``I'm very elated to be at home,'' said Lloyd Graham, 48, ofHouston. ``The celebration won't start until all our friends andcolleagues can come home, too.''   Nine other freed Americans stayed in London overnight and wereexpected to fly to the United States later today. The hostages'release came after a meeting Sunday between Saddam and members ofthe Washington-based American-Iraqi Foundation.   Saddam, who seized Kuwait in a dispute over money, land and oil,prevented thousands of foreigners from leaving Iraq and theconquered emirate, and has used some as human shields to protectkey installations against potential attack.
