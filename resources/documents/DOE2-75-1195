To reach valid conclusions for multi-unitplants, it is essential that the net effective damping of unequally loadedunits be known. For the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, extensivetesting and analysis have been performed to verify and develop an accuratemeans of determining the effective damping of unequally loaded unitsin parallel. This has led to a unique and simple algorithm which correlateswell with two other analytic techniques.</TEXT></DOC>
