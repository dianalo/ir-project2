Seeking inspiration, he and producer Gene Griffin headedfor New York. The result was ``My Perogative,'' a No. 1 smash offthe million-selling ``Don't Be Cruel.''   ``I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and Ithought, `Where better than New York to come up with it,''' saidBrown, an original member of New Edition, one of the hottest groupsof the 1980s.   ``A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, why was hedoing this (a solo career). It's my way of expressing to people it'syour perogative to do as you want but make sure what you do is theright thing.''   Brown has erased any doubts about his decision to leave NewEdition in 1987. Although he had originally planned to return to thegroup after one album, the success of ``Don't Be Cruel'' and hisfirst solo record, ``King of Stage,'' have established him as amajor star in his own right.   ``None of these songs could have come by New Edition,'' Brownsaid. ``I wanted to express more of me. In a group you're limited.You have different roles''   Brown grew up in the same Boston ghetto of Roxbury as fellow NewEdition members Ralph Tresvant, Michael Bivins, Ricky Bell andRonnie DeVoe. They began singing together in 1981 when Brown wasjust 13, and made their debut in a matinee performance at Boston'sHigh Hat club.   ``We sang a Jackson Five number,'' Brown recalled. ``It was thestart of something big. We enjoyed performing together and we usedto go around to the matinee clubs. We were the ones out of theneighborthood who took the time to try and do something better forourselves.   The Jackson Five would loom large in the early days of NewEdition. Not only were they both five-man vocal groups barely intotheir teens, but New Edition's breakthrough hit in 1983, ``CandyGirl,'' had an uncanny resemblance to Jackson 5 songs such as``ABC'' and ``The Love You Save.''   The groups had something else in common: fans, devoted ones.   ``In one town, it got totally out of hand and we all ended up inthe hospital,'' Brown said. ``We were going to the show and when ourcar pulled up a gentleman we thought was with the organizers told usto go through this door.   ``But it was the wrong door. The audience turned around and sawus and they started chasing us. We were terrified.''   There were further hit records and sold-out shows, but NewEdition would run into legal problems when producer Maurice Starrfiled suit, claiming he had legal rights to the group's name.Although a Boston judge ruled in New Edition's favor, Brown decidedin 1987 to go out on his own.   ``It was time for a direction change,'' Brown said. ``I loved thegroup and we will be friends forever but I would catch myself goinginto my own thing at times on stage. I have a real energetic type ofpersonality. They were going for all-American boys so to speak. Iwanted to express more to my audience.''   But Brown admitted that the decision took its toll emotionally.   ``Yeah, it was tough. It took a lot of going over, a lot ofgetting used to. It wasn't an easy decision by no means. They tookit as well as could be expected. We left in good standing.''   His first solo album came out in 1987 and contained the single,``Girl Friend,'' which topped the Randamp;B charts. But on stage, atleast, some adjusting was necessary.   ``I went on a tour with Ready for the World. I got up there and Iwas going through a New Edition song like `Mr. Telephone Man' and Iwould start anticipating that Ralph would come in for his part,'' hesaid. ``It didn't take me a real long time to get over thatfeeling.''   ``Don't Be Cruel,'' a mixture of uptempo tracks and ballads, hasestablished Brown as a major crossover artist at a time, ironically,that New Edition's latest album is also topping the charts. Thesinger's desire to let people see the ``real'' Bobby Brown wastested by the title track.   ``The people in the studio had seen a girl I had brought to therehearsals,'' Brown said. ``They got a feeling that she was beingcruel to me. The song was devised around that. I knew it was a goodtune.''   But Brown didn't anticipate the song reaching the Top 5 or thealbum becoming one of the year's biggest sellers. The singer calledit a ``pleasant surprise.''   ``To tell you the truth, I was hoping for a single platinum. Thatwould have been a feat that I would have loved to have attained. Nowbeing multi-platinum is inconceivable. I'm still overwhelmed at thenumbers.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Feb 17-19</NOTE></DOC>
