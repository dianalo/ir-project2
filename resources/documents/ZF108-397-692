Frank Since we have been doing a lot oftesting of the new laser printers the last few months, I have kept a look outfor software that enhances the laser printing experience.andP;  Last month Idiscussed MGI's PagePak.andP;  This month I have found two exciting new packages.andM;JetPropulsionandM;JetPropulsion (Digital Products, Inc., 108 Water Street, Watertown, MA.,andO;02172;617-924-1680) is a $95 printer utility specifically designed to speedup printing with Hewlett-Packard LaserJet IIP and III, Series II upgrades,DeskJet, and PCL 5.0 compatible printers.andP;  The publisher claims speedincreases ranging from 200% when printing from a parallel port to 500% whenprinting from a serial port.andP;  Actual increases depend on the graphicspackage, personal computer and the printer you are using.andM;We ran a brief series of tests using Harvard Graphics to verify thepublisher's claims.andP;  All these tests were run using the parallel connectionto the printer.andP;  Heavily black symbols, about 50% of the sheet, improved themost, almost half the time, using JetPropulsion.andP;  A simple chart that showeda local area network with several computer symbols for workstations and aserver improved about 35% while a simple graphic word chart improved only 7%.andO;The chart we show below improved about 32%.andM;Overall, I would say that anything that improves laser printing inexpensivelyshould be considered.andP;  A few seconds saved here and there can mean a lot oftime over a month.andP;  I think every graphics user of the HP LJ IIP and IIIshould buy this one now.andM;PreScriptandM;I have seen several ads lately that say &quot;PostScript Power For Your LaserJet.andO;Only $195.&quot;andP;  I figure that's a heck of a deal and everyone should have one.andO;We all know that PostScript printers are expensive.andP;  Do PostScript emulatorsperform as claimed?andP;  I decided to call a vendor for an evaluation copy totry.andP;  PreScript (Pan Overseas Computer, 44 Route 46, Pine Brook, N.J.;andO;201-808-1900) offers 13 PostScript fonts for $195 or 35 PostScript fonts for$395.andP;  The program actually runs in 80286/80386 protected mode and utilizesRational Systems DOS Extender, thereby utilizing Extended memory.andM;The installation process was a simple ten minutes.andP;  It took about three and ahalf megabytes of hard disk to store the programs and fonts.andP;  (This is the 35font version.)andP;  The &quot;Readme&quot; file on the disk had several caveats includingone regarding using the package with Microsoft Word, my word processor ofchoice.andM;It seems that the PreScript program requires a Ctl-D as an end of documentindicator.andP;  Since Word does not have this, the PreScript user has to performan additional operation to get the last page out of the printer.andP;  This isaccomplished by shelling out of Word to DOS, LIBRARY, RUN and then selectinga DOS batch program, supplied by the publisher, which merely copies a Ctl-Dto the printer port.andP;  Although somewhat clumsily, it solves the program bugthat the Technical Support folks assured me is in the works to be fixed withthe next PreScript release.andP;  I printed several documents and used the &quot;FLUSH&quot;batch program to get the last page of the document without any problem.andM;Another significant feature of PreScript is its ability to support PostScriptprinting within Microsoft Windows.andP;  My experience has been that users havemany, many problems printing with Windows.andP;  Not only does PreScript allowWindows users to utilize PostScript, but it also provides a preview mode forPostScript printing, a feature not offered by other printing solutions.andM;However, it took me several hours to get my machine set up to try PreScriptwith Windows.andP;  Let me quickly say that this was not a PreScript problem, butrather a function of my software configuration.andP;  To use PreScript withWindows, the user must have a full copy of Windows, not a run time version.andO;I use Quarterdeck Expanded Memory Manager (QEMM) in my 14 MB PS/2 Model 70.andO;I have a copy of Windows/386, which will not work with QEMM, on my system aswell as a copy of the run time version Windows/286.andP;  Since I needed aWindows/286 copy to run PreScript, I dug out my copy, which is on 5 1/4&quot; 1.2MB diskettes which do not work on my PS/2.andM;So, I attached my Toshiba 1600 to my AT, cranked up LapLink III and proceededto copy the four diskettes to 31/2&quot;.andP;  I then proceeded to install Windows/286on the PS/2 until I ran out of disk space.andP;  After purging files, one of whichI shouldn't have, I finally brought up everything that was needed and ranPreScript with Windows.andP;  Finally, I was able to test PreScript with windows.andO;Both the Windows preview and the printing worked as advertised.andM;All in all, PreScript is an inexpensive way to have PostScript printingwithout the extra cost.andP;  The entry package is only $195 for thirteen fonts!andO;We used the new Hewlett Packard LaserJet III for our printing and everythingworked beautifully.andP;  I suggest you take a close look at this as a possiblesolution for PostScript requirements.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
