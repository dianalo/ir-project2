The authors investigated the influences governingthe handling of gas-tight threaded joints in transport, jointing andfield-testing; on this basis, they present recommendations concerningthe assembly of gas-tight pipelines and the improvement of pipeline safety.An extended method of calculation for determining the optimum screeningmomentum and a novel method of analysis for determining stress distributionsin the thread and joint region are presented. Gas permeability testingof threaded joints screwed up in situ is hampered by the temporary sealingeffect of thread grease. Improved greasing techniques to prevent thisare investigated, and surface treatment techniques using ion implantationare investigated which are to prevent corrosion in the thread and jointregion.
