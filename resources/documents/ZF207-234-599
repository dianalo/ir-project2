(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The New Electronic Encyclopedia Early in 1986, Grolier Electronic Publishingbecame the first company to release a mass-market CD-ROM disk when itintroduced The Electronic Encyclopedia, a CD-ROM version of the AcademicAmerican Encyclopedia.andP;  Grolier's latest release, The New ElectronicEncyclopedia, offers a spanking-new retrieval interface by Online ComputerSystems and greater access to the print version's 21 volumes of information.andM;One look at the printed encyclopedia may prompt a question: why were theAcademic American's wealth of illustrations left off a disk filled to afraction of its total capacity?andP;  The answer, however, is hardly an oversight:the product's primary market, the library, is not ordinarily equipped withthe video capabilities required to display graphics images.andP;  And at $395, thedisk costs less than half the list price of the print version.andM;You won't miss the graphics: more than 30,690 articles, replete withcross-references to related subjects, can be summoned in up to ten windows ata time.andP;  Bibliographies, &quot;factboxes&quot; (summaries), outlines, and tables areincluded as well.andM;GETTING STARTEDandM;Installing The New Electronic Encyclopedia is easier than it may seem fromthe documentation.andP;  The product does not require the Microsoft CD-ROMextensions, but if you've installed them, that's fine, too--the retrievalsoftware's installation will modify its own EE.BAT file to suit your existingconfiguration.andM;The manual, though brief, runs you through the basic setup and explains theprogram's versatile search methods.andP;  A glossary, command summary, and list of158 stop words--e.g.andP;  prepositions, single letters, and linking verbs, whichare ignored as search criteria--are included.andP;  Also evident is the company'swish to assume the role of electronic librarian: the manual's discussion onsearch techniques warns the end user (primarily students from grade 6 throughcollege) to quote freely but never, never to plagiarize--an easy temptationwhen you can save anything to disk.andM;At the start of a search, highlighting Word Search lets you determine whicharticles on the disk include a word or phrase.andP;  Searches generously allow *and ? wild-cards, plus any combination of AND, OR, and NOT that you'd need.andO;If a search yields more than 50 titles, a message will pop up to suggest younarrow your search.andM;There are limitations, however.andP;  Once you've viewed the first on your list ofarticles, there's no quick advance to the next article; you must backtrack tothe list.andP;  And if you've found 20 articles that satisfy your search criteria,the titles of only 10 at a time reside in RAM; a disk read is expected whenyou're calling up an article, but tedious when you want just five moretitles.andP;  Searches are reasonably quick but indicative of how far CD-ROMtechnology still must improve: a complex search for both articles containingthe phrases &quot;New Testament&quot; OR &quot;Letters of Paul&quot; AND &quot;Ephesians&quot; but NOT&quot;Love,&quot; for instance, took 19 seconds to complete on an 8-MHz AT, plus 3seconds to call up the first article.andM;DISPLAYING TEXTandM;Once displayed, an article can be displayed full-screen or in windows sizedto accommodate other windows.andP;  Search words or phrases are highlightedthroughout the text (Tab takes you to the next occurrence), and uppercasewords indicate the presence of an article linked to the original entry; hitEnter with the cursor over one of these words, and a window with the relatedarticle pops up with additional information.andM;Text can be saved onto your floppy or hard disk--one paragraph, page, orarticle at a time--or printed through a straight ASCII dump.andP;  But if all youwant to do is mark your place and return to it later, the Bookmark feature iswhat you want.andP;  Bookmark places are stored in the Note-pad, a handySideKick-like window whose contents can be saved on disk.andM;Whenever the next version of The New Electronic Encyclopedia (&quot;The Newer,&quot;perhaps) is released, its retrieval software is expected to offer the mousesupport that's noticeably absent from the Alt-key and windowing interface.andO;And the occasional unclear prompt displayed during such routines as markingtext should be smoothed over as well.andP;  But if you're looking for a goodresearch tool, don't let the product's quirks sway you: The New ElectronicEncyclopedia is well worth a look.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
