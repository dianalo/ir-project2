(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Employees in Du Pont Co.'s fibers departmentwill receive bonuses equal to 3 percent of their 1988 salaries nextweek in the first fruit of an experimental pay plan, an executivesaid Friday.   When the plan takes full effect next year, a portion ofemployees' pay raises will be tied to the department'sprofitability. The Wilmington, Del.-based chemical giant has toutedthe plan as a way to increase profitability by giving employees astake in the business.   The 20,000-employee fibers department makes products such asnylon, Dacron, Lycra, Orlon, Kevlar and Antron.   Next week's bonuses are considered an incentive because theprogram is not fully in operation and no portion of employees'salaries was actually at risk.   Next year if the department performs poorly they could lose theentire amount they put at risk.   ``We announced to employees in early February that ourperformance in 1988 was such that we would have a 3 percent payout.Checks will be distributed Monday and Tuesday,'' said Robert McNutt,who led the team that developed the plan.   If the department meets 80 percent of its 1989 earnings goal,employees will receive half of their pay that was at risk. If thegoal is met, employees will receive all of the ``at risk'' money.Employees could receive three times the amount at risk if earningsgoals are exceeded by 50 percent.   For 1988, the department overshot its goal for after-taxoperating income of $626 million by about 12.5 percent, resulting inthe 3 percent payout, according to McNutt.   The bonuses are ``an incentive for the people participating inthe program. It's a way of saying thanks for the job that we didtogether as a team in 1988 and so it's a bonus as we move towardvariable pay for 1989,'' McNutt said.   It is expected to take three to five years to fully phase in theplan until the employee has a maximum amount of money at risk equalto 6 percent of what their pay would have been if they had receivedall scheduled raises.   Employees who do not receive a raise this year will not have payat risk and thus will not be eligible for bonuses.   During the phase-in period, each employee will always receive atleast 1 percent of any raise, regardless of the fibers businessperformance.   McNutt noted, however, that late last year about 10,000 employeesvoluntarily put 2 percent of salary ``at risk'' for this year.   The plan was mandatory for all department employees exceptunionized workers. About 2,000 production workers at the Spruanceplant in Richmond, Va., voted against the plan, McNutt said, whilethe others voted to be in. The department has about 6,000 to 7,000union workers at plants in Delaware, Tennessee and Virginia.   Du Pont said if the plan works, it could become a model for thewhole company.</TEXT></DOC>
