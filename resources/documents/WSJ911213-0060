Loews, the big insurance, hotel and tobacco company headedby investor Laurence A. Tisch, said its Diamond M Corp. unitsigned a letter of intent to buy Murphy Oil's Odeco DrillingInc. The $357.8 million purchase price for the NewOrleans-based company is subject to adjustment, Loews said.</LP><TEXT>   Completion of the deal is subject to negotiation of adefinitive agreement and certain regulatory approvals, butLoews said it expects to complete the transaction in January.Houston-based Diamond M will be getting a major offshorecontract-drilling company.   Loews started boosting its investments in oil and gasdrilling equipment in 1990, Diamond M's first full year ofoperations. In 1990, Diamond M had revenue of $26.2 millionand a loss from continuing operations of $5.8 million. Mr.Tisch is well known for seeking out valuable assets atbargain prices, and the offshore drilling industry has beenslumping in recent years, with an oversupply of equipment inthe hands of many companies.   &quot;Ugly is not descriptive enough&quot; to describe themarketplace, said Bryan Dutt, an oil-service analyst atHoward Weil Labouisse Friedrichs Inc. in New Orleans. Dayrates for most rigs are depressed and aren't expected to pickup soon. &quot;This is just one of many consolidations that shouldhappen over the next several years,&quot; Mr. Dutt said.   He said the acquisition price is &quot;fair.&quot; He said heexpects Diamond M to try to sell off some of thebetter-quality rigs in the fleet piecemeal, which could fetchbetter prices.   Murphy has been trying to figure out what to do with theOdeco fleet for some time. Last June it completed a tenderoffer for about $380 million to buy the 39% of Odeco itdidn't already own. At the time, Diamond M and another rigcompany, Reading andamp; Bates Corp., jointly made a $400 millioncash-and-stock bid to buy Odeco but later withdrew it.Despite the bidding contest for Odeco, many industryexecutives were skeptical that Murphy wanted to remain in therig business for the long term.</TEXT></DOC>
