The proposed jump is a sign that the FDIC is anxious aboutensuring that its bank insurance fund is big enough to handlefuture failures without having to turn to taxpayers, who arealready angry that the bailout of the savings-and-loaninsurance fund will cost them $150 billion or more.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The point here is that we are increasing the cost ofdeposit insurance to banks to meet a problem we are facing, adecline in the fund,&quot; FDIC Chairman William Seidman said at aboard meeting yesterday. The proposal was passed unanimouslyby the FDIC's five-person board, and is expected to beapproved after a 30-day comment period.   The FDIC proposed to increase next year's premiums to 19.5cents per $100 of deposits from 12 cents per $100 this year.Last year's Sandamp;L bailout bill had already mandated an increaseto 15 cents next year, but gave the FDIC the discretion toraise the premium another 4.5 cents. The agency's proposal ofthe maximum increase underlines its concern about bankfailures, especially as the economy appears to be headinginto a recession.   The higher premiums could have a significant effect on thebanking industry. The FDIC said a $1.1 billion increase,which would be brought in by the extra 4.5-cent assessment,amounts to 7.3% of the industry's 1989 net income of $15billion after taxes and nonrecurring gains. That doesn'tinclude the $850 million in payments that will result nextyear from the increase to 15 cents from 12 cents mandated inthe bailout law.   Nevertheless, Mr. Seidman said, the impact on the bankingindustry is unclear because banks will try to pass along someof the higher costs to their customers by lowering interestrates paid on deposits or by increasing fees.   In the first losses in its history, the FDIC's bankinsurance fund had deficits totaling more than $5 billion in1988 and 1989, mostly from bailouts of banks in theeconomically troubled Southwest. The losses have left thefund standing at $13.2 billion, equal to about 70 cents per$100 of insured deposits.   While government policy is to maintain the fund at $1.25per $100 of deposits, Mr. Seidman has said the bank failurescould cost the FDIC as much as $2 billion this year, whichwould leave the fund at about 60 cents per $100. The fund isa backstop for about $2 trillion in insured deposits atbanks.   &quot;We have a considerable way to go to bring it back to thelevel at which Congress thinks it should be,&quot; Mr. Seidmansaid. The FDIC chief predicted it would take at least fiveyears to reach the $1.25 mark. He also said &quot;it's our hope&quot;that the proposed premium increase would prevent a loss bythe bank fund next year.   Charles Cranmer, a banking analyst with Shearson LehmanBrothers Inc., said he was more concerned about whether theincrease would be enough to handle future bank failures thanabout how the higher costs would affect banks. &quot;If we'reheading into a recession, I'm not sure that will be enough,&quot;he said. &quot;If we're staring at some big bank failures, then $1billion won't make much of a difference.&quot;   The banking industry responded guardedly to the proposal,grudgingly accepting the premium increase as necessary, butusing it as an occasion to call for deposit-insurancerevisions aimed at lowering the government's costs in bankbailouts.   &quot;Our industry has the capacity and willingness to meet ourobligation,&quot; said Donald Ogilvie, executive vice president ofthe American Bankers Association. But, he said, &quot;furtherincreases will place additional strain on bank earnings andaffect the industry's ability to raise capital.&quot;   A trade group representing small community banks, theIndependent Bankers Association of America, wrote to the FDIClast week urging the agency to consider assessing premiums ondeposits in foreign branches of U.S. banks -- which arealmost exclusively the bigger banks on the East and WestCoasts -- rather than raising premiums on domestic deposits.   The IBAA estimated that the FDIC could raise $537 millionnext year by assessing the foreign deposits at 15 cents per$100. Technically, foreign deposits aren't insured, but theassociation argues that the FDIC would never allow foreigndepositors to lose money. Assessing some other liabilitiesmostly held by big banks could raise an additional $364million, the association said.</TEXT></DOC>
