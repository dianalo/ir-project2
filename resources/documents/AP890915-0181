(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker got hundreds ofthousands of dollars in bonuses even while hundreds of workers werebeing laid off from his television ministry before the Christmasholidays, witnesses testified Friday.   ``I called my children together and said, `I'm sorry to tell youthis, but we won't have Christmas until after because the checkwon't be here,''' Joanie Ames, a former PTL payroll clerk and singlemother of two, testified in Bakker's fraud and conspiracy trial.   She was laid off in November 1985 with 285 other PTL employees,saving the ministry $3.6 million, said Chris Easley, PTL's personneldirector for 1{ years.   The prosecution has said that Bakker received a $200,000 bonus onNov. 12, 1985, and Tammy got a $100,000 bonus. Less than a yearlater, on Nov. 3, 1986, the PTL board approved a $500,000 bonus forBakker.   The Rev. Evelyn Spencer of Oakland, Calif., who joined the boardof PTL in November 1985, testified that the largest bonus sheremembered approving was $150,000 plus taxes.   But when asked by prosecutor Deborah Smith if she would haveapproved a $500,000 bonus for Bakker, Ms. Spencer said: ``Ifeverybody else agreed with it, I would have.''   She said she trusted Bakker to inform board members of theministry's financial condition. ``I just trusted him, period,'' shesaid.   She said she was never informed about the extent of an InternalRevenue Service investigation and church secretary Jessica Hahn'sthreat of a civil lawsuit over her sexual encounter with Bakker.   She said she learned of the lawsuit threat in March 1987 whenBakker resigned from the ministry over the scandal.   Prosecutors accuse Bakker of diverting millions of dollars in PTLmoney to fund his lavish lifestyle. If found guilty of the 24 countsagainst him, Bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prison andfined more than $5 million.   In later testimony Friday, a Los Angeles lawyer said PTLofficials were eager to reach a settlement with Ms. Hahn and wantedto keep the matter quiet.   Scott Furstman, who said he was contacted by Richard Dortch,PTL's executive vice president, testified that Ms. Hahn's complaintsought $12 million.   Furstman said he saw many problems with the complaint, but ``Rev.Dortch indicated he still had a strong desire to settle. Dortch wasvery concerned that the matter did not become public.''   A deal finally struck between Dortch and Ms. Hahn included a$115,000 payment to Ms. Hahn, with $150,000 in a trust account forher. The trust was never set up, but the money was deposited in amoney market account.   The trust fund money eventually was returned to the trustee inPTL's bankruptcy proceedings in July 1988.   Former PTL board member Aimee Cortese testified that Bakker nevertold the board about the $265,000 paid to Ms. Hahn in exchange forher silence.   Mrs. Cortese, a minister at the Crossroads Tabernacle Church inNew York City, recalled being asked by Dortch to assist him inpaying Ms. Hahn a total of $14,000 in 1984.   Mrs. Cortese testified that Dortch called her into his office andspelled out the details of Bakker's sexual liaison. She said shelater handed over $2,000 to Ms. Hahn on one occasion and $12,000 ona later date.   She recalled a comment Bakker made to her regarding Hahn. ``Hesaid she wasn't what she said she was as far as being a virgin,''Mrs. Cortese said, recalling Bakker's words. ``He said she was awoman of the world.''   Mrs. Cortese said she never would have voted for the bonuses hadshe known about PTL's financial condition. ``It didn't make sense,''she said. ``How could you give away bonuses while you were floating(checks)?''   Former PTL controller Dana Caldwell testified that PTL had a poordebt-to-asset ratio during Bakker's tenure, at one time at 1-to-3.PTL was nearly $37 million in debt when Bakker resigned in March1987, with assets of about $9 million.</TEXT></DOC>
