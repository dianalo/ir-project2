As the number of accounting firms doing audits shrinks,those left see a chance to raise fees.</LP><TEXT>   Many businesses may find it tougher and more expensive tohire auditors needed to certify their financial statements.Small companies may be hit especially hard because largeraccounting firms feel that small-cost audits aren't worththeir while without the added consulting and tax work a bigcompany can give them.   &quot;As smaller companies find it harder to get their auditsdone, audit fees could rise 20% to 30%,&quot; says Dan Goldwasser,an attorney who does liability consulting for the33,000-member New York State Society of Certified PublicAccountants. &quot;Fewer accounting firms are willing to risk theliability exposure.&quot;   Frustration is already evident. &quot;It's been difficultfinding an auditor for the small public medical-suppliescompany for which I do internal accounting work,&quot; saysLeonard Simon. (Under Securities and Exchange Commissionindependence rules, his own small accounting firm can't auditcompanies for which it does inside bookkeeping.)   Mr. Simon first offered the $125,000 audit to Schreiber andamp;Sontag, another small, three-partner accounting firm here; ofits 40 clients, the biggest pays $40,000 for an annual audit.But Barry Schreiber, the firm's managing partner turned downthe offer.   &quot;The size of recent court awards in auditing negligencecases scares the dickens out of us,&quot; says Mr. Schreiber. Heturned the audit over to Richard Eisner andamp; Co., a much largeraccounting firm that currently audits 40 public companies.&quot;We decided to limit our liability exposure and hold down ourinsurance costs, which could be 40% to 50% higher if we didaudits of public companies,&quot; Mr. Schreiber adds.   Smaller accounting firms have good reason to shy away fromaudits, which have cost CPA firms of all sizes large sums innegligence cases. Last month, one such award set a record. ATexas jury hit Coopers andamp; Lybrand with a $200 millionpunitive-damage award for its allegedly faulty audit ofnow-defunct MiniScribe Corp. While the case was settledout-of-court for an undisclosed sum-presumably less than $200million-the plaintiffs' attorney says the payment was still a&quot;large sum of money.&quot;   Last year, Ernst andamp; Young paid $43.5 million to settle anegligence case involving a predecessor firm's audit ofcollapsed Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan. KPMG Peat Marwick inEngland anted up $67.9 million for an allegedly faulty auditof a former Peat client. And Cherry, Bekaert andamp; Holland, asmall Charlotte, N.C., accounting firm, paid $2.5 million tofederal regulators as a result of a 1983 audit of a Floridabank that later collapsed.   Such awards are causing some accounting firms to limit theservices they offer new audit clients. &quot;We've become a lotmore careful about the services we perform for an auditclient,&quot; says Robert Israeloff, executive partner ofIsraeloff, Trattner andamp; Co., a Valley Stream, N.Y., firm with700 clients.   Mr. Israeloff says that in the past his firm has oftenshown audit clients how to improve financial and billingsystems by using multiform purchase orders. &quot;Now we thinktwice before offering such advice,&quot; he adds. &quot;If the companygoes out of business, shareholders and creditors could sue usas `the deep pocket,' saying our business advice was thereason for the collapse.&quot;   Companies seeking outside auditors to certify financialreports when they go public find the search is gettingtougher. Some accounting firms are shying away from suchaudits, which generate many malpractice suits againstaccountants by disgruntled investors when the company hasproblems that aren't revealed in audited financialstatements.   Aware of these legal pitfalls, Parker, Wittus andamp; Co., aSouthfield, Mich., accounting firm, is taking its time inweighing whether it wants to do the audit of a Midwestfranchiser of recreational products planning to go public.The franchiser approached Parker Wittus two months ago tohelp prepare financial statements, but the accounting firmstill hasn't decided whether to take the job.   &quot;At one time, we would have been much more aggressive intaking such an audit, but now we want to look at all thecompany's past financial records and franchise agreementsbefore making a decision&quot; to see whether there's anyliability exposure, says Arnold Krieger, Parker Wittus'smanaging partner.   Afraid of being sued, some small accounting firms areshying away from audits of any companies. In New York,recently formed Condon, O'Meara, McGinty andamp; Donnelly isspecializing in nonprofit private clubs and won't take on anynew audits of for-profit enterprises.   Investors, creditors and suppliers filing &quot;court suits area lot tougher on small, entreprenurial companies and theirauditors if the companies fail to make money, whereas anonprofit {organization} doesn't have public stock and canbreak even or even run a deficit without stirring up a stormin court,&quot; says Thomas Donnelly, a Condon O'Meara partner.   A recent survey by the California Society of CertifiedPublic Accountants confirms one reason why small businessesare likely to have a tough time finding an auditor: Of morethan 1,500 small CPA firms in the state that mainlyspecialize in small business, the portion doing audit workdeclined to 53% in 1990 from 61% in 1988.   &quot;While only 6% of the annual revenues of these smallaccounting firms came from auditing, it accounted for 31% oftheir litigation costs,&quot; says Michael Ueltzen, a Sacramentoaccountant who headed the survey. &quot;This race away fromauditing will accelerate and boost audit fees for smallbusiness,&quot; Mr. Ueltzen observes.   Jay Nisberg, a Ridgefield, Conn., planning consultant tomore than 100 accounting firms, says that as the ranks ofaccounting firms shrink, small companies shopping forauditors &quot;may be forced by banks and regulators to selectauditors they wouldn't otherwise pick.&quot; He adds: &quot;It's not ahappy prospect for small companies seeking to go public,borrow money or buy property or equipment on credit where anaudit is required.&quot;   Accountants say fear of liability exposure is making ittougher for certain highrisk businesses to find auditors atall.   Goldstein Golub Kessler, a medium-sized accounting firm inNew York with more than 1,500 clients, says it's turning downaudit work for banks, insurance companies and credit unions.&quot;Such audits could lead to malpractice suits,&quot; says GeraldGolub, the firm's managing partner. &quot;The financial servicesindustry is rife with problems, and the risks of doing anaudit there aren't worth the fees.&quot;   In Buffalo, N.Y., Freed, Maxick, Sachs andamp; Murphy, anothermedium-sized accounting firm, with 700 clients, has turneddown audits of three public companies over the past two yearsbecause &quot;we fear the litigation that could result,&quot; saysLeonard Freed, the firm's managing partner. Over the past twoyears, there has been a rise of 20% in the number ofnegligence suits against 30 other firms that share suchinformation with Freed Maxick, says Mr. Freed. &quot;A half-dozenof them are going bare -- without liability insurance -- andone big court judgment could put them out of business andwipe out their partners' net worth.&quot;   Howard Stone, managing partner of Altschuler, Melvoin andamp;Glasser, with offices in Chicago and Los Angeles, says thatsince the firm lost its two public-company clients two yearsago, it has avoided audits of public companies. &quot;Thelitigious climate is just too hot for us,&quot; says Mr. Stone.   Instead, Altschuler Melvoin is helping the litigators; ithas created a department of 28 accountants and two attorneyswho testify for plaintiffs in malpractice suits. Mr. Stonenotes that the unit now contributes 12% of the firm's $45million of annual revenue, compared with 2% of $36 milliontwo years ago.   ---                     Limiting the Risk                                                                                                          Steps accounting firms are taking to reduce liabilityexposure, as expressed in a survey of 500 CPAs in firms of 50or more accountants:                                                                                                          100% -- Doing internal professional reviews of audits   98% -- Developing new risk-management procedures byspelling out scope of CPA's job in letters to clients   98% -- Upgrading internal standards   87% -- Including disclaimers specifying appropriate use oftheir work   79% -- Limiting services offered   56% -- Limiting industries served                                                                                                          In the same survey, accountants said they believe thelimits of their responsibilities are:                                                                                                          92% -- Accuracy   77% -- Independent evaluation of a company's financialsituation   3% -- Guaranteeing a company's financial stability                                                                                                          Source: Johnson andamp; Higgins Financial Group   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          ALTSCHULER, MELVOIN andamp; GLASSER said that it has created adepartment of accountants and attorneys that has testifiedfor defendants in malpractice suits against accountants.
