Howe said an easing of tensions in the Middle East shouldimprove the climate for the release of the hostages.   ``I think that if we continue to see progress towards a calmerstate of affairs in all the troubled areas in the Middle East, thenthe reason _ and there is no justifiable reason _ that people arebeing held hostage, begins to disappear,'' Howe said.   Howe met four former French hostages Wednesday in Brighton,where his Conservative Party is holding its annual convention. Hespoke today on British Broadcasting Corp. television.   ``There are reasons to believe that the prospects (of release)are getting better rather than worse,'' he said. ``But I don't wantto raise false hopes. I have no news today or tomorrow of anysignificant change in the position.''   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals believedheld in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists: AnglicanChurch envoy Terry Waite, journalist John McCarthy and teacherBrian Keenan. Keenan, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, has dualBritish and Irish nationality.   Howe reiterated that while Britain continued to ``press andprobe and search'' in every way possible to secure their release,``it would not be right to engage in deals or bargains or surrenderto blackmail.''   Nine Americans are among the foreign hostages missing in Lebanon.   The longest held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped on March16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
