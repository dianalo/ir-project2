The legislation, approved by a voice vote in both the Senate andHouse, grew out of revelations of fraud, influence-peddling andpolitical favoritism at HUD during the Reagan administration.   The multibillion-dollar scandal has been the subject ofcongressional and criminal investigations.   Bush said the measure would ``improve program management andfinancial accountability at HUD and make that department's programsless susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse and political influence.''   The bill requires consultants and lobbyists working on HUDprograms to register with the department and identify their clientsand fees they receive. Recipients of HUD grants would have toreport their use of consultants and lobbyists.   HUD would be required to publish notices of fundingavailability, including waivers of regulations as a way to preventsubsidy awards based on insider information. The measure alsoimposes strict limitations on the use of discretionary funds by HUD.   Bush said in a statement that ``never again must we let'' theprograms of HUD or any other agency be ``abused for politicalpurposes or personal gain.''   The law, he said, ``represents a bispartisan approach tocorrecting many of HUD's past problems and helping to ensure thatin the future that department will better serve those who depend onits programs.''   Other provisions:   _Create a HUD chief financial officer's position, as well as acomptroller of the Federal Housing Administration, to overseefinancial management.   _Apply new restrictions on the Section 8 moderate rehabilitationprogram, which provided subsidies for renovating low-income housingthat were at the heart of evidence of influence-peddling andpolitical favoritism in the HUD scandals.   _Make it illegal for consultants to sell their influence insecuring housing subsidies for a contingent fee or a per-unit fee,as occurred during the Reagan administration.   _Strengthen the secretary's ability to enforce new HUD laws withcivil fines against developers, consultants, applicants andmortgage lenders. It would restrict the secretary's ability to usediscretion in awarding housing assistance.</TEXT></DOC>
