(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelist Jim Bakker pleaded innocentTuesday to federal charges that he diverted millions of dollars fromhis PTL television audience for personal use.   Bakker's lawyer, George T. Davis, asked U.S. Magistrate PaulTaylor during the hearing for a gag order for all parties involved,based largely on comments by the retired federal bankruptcy judgewho supervised the sale of PTL assets.   Taylor said he would consider the request, instructing attorneysfrom both sides to draft a consent order and present it to him byThursday for approval. The magistrate told Davis he was concernedBakker would go on television and talk about the case, but he issuedno formal request for Bakker to keep quiet.   Bakker was silent during the hearing, but made a statementafterward.   ``I am definitely not guilty of any charges in this indictment,''Bakker said. ``The judge asked for no conversations about this case,but I'd like to say that Tammy and I are thrilled to be back on TV.''   The Bakkers began broadcasting ``The Jim and Tammy Show'' fromtheir leased home near Charlotte earlier this month. Bakker didn'tappear on the telecast Tuesday and his wife, Tammy Faye, handled theprogram alone.   Bakker quit the PTL ministry in March 1987 after admitting asexual encounter with former secretary Jessica Hahn and paying hermoney to keep quiet. The ministry he founded wound up seekingreorganization in bankruptcy court a few months later. Bakker triedto raise money to buy back the ministry, but failed.   Last month a Canadian businessman bought the ministry's assets,including a Christian theme park, at a bankruptcy auction. The fateof PTL's religious operation is unclear.   In seeking the gag order, Davis presented Taylor with a copy of arecent newspaper article in which retired U.S. Bankruptcy JudgeRufus Reynolds called Bakker a ``sawed-off little runt.''   Taylor asked Davis if any of the comments made by Reynoldsfocused on whether he felt Bakker was guilty or innocent of thecharges contained in the indictment.   Davis responded affirmatively, saying Reynolds described hisclient as ``a thief.''   ``We can't see how we can have a fair trial if we're innundatedwith pre-trial negative publicity, especially from a federaljudge,'' Davis said. ``How can we prevent this? This guy is a loosecannon. He's already gone overboard.''   Davis said Reynolds' statements could have affect potentialjurors.   ``This judge needs to be restrained,'' he said. ``He simplycannot control himself. Just think of the dangers that this kind ofpre-trial publicity could cause.''   Deborah Smith, a U.S. Justice Department prosecutor handling thecase, said the government was willing to agree to a consent order.   ``The government is very concerned about the pre-trialpublicity,'' she said, adding that prosecutors also were consideringfiling a motion for a gag order.   Ms. Smith said prosecutors were concerned that Davis' requestmight be part of a strategy to get the case moved. Outside thecourthouse, Davis declined to say whether he planned to ask that thejury trial be moved out of Charlotte.   Taylor tentatively scheduled the trial for the court's Februaryterm but set no specific date. He also gave the attorneys 15 days tofile other motions, such as a request for a continuance.   Bakker and three of his former top aides at the nearby PTLtelevision ministry in Fort Mill, S.C., were indicted Dec. 5 after a16-month federal grand jury investigation into PTL's operation underBakker's leadership. The three have pleaded innocent to charges.</TEXT></DOC>
