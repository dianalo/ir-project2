In explaining the proposal to the membership, Local 14 PresidentWilliam Meserve said IP would not fire replacement workers who havebeen hired at the mill.   Workers ``were quite upset by what they heard,'' union stewardStephen Blodgett said by telephone after the meeting.   He said more than 1,000 workers had gathered at the JayCommunity Building to hear from Local 14 President William Meserveas he outlined the proposal he had brought from Kentucky last weekfollowing negotiations with IP executives.   Everyone voted individually, but Blodgett said he and the peoplearound him voted against the latest contract offer in the10-month-old dispute.   Union members who did not vote Sunday night could vote today atthe union hall.   The Jay votes will be pooled with ballots cast by workersinvolved in labor disputes at IP mills in three other states. Thefinal tally will be submitted to the United PaperworkersInternational Union headquarters by Friday, said Dennis Couture, amember of the executive board of UPIU's Local 14.   Local 14 Vice President Mike Burke said Sunday there was littlequestion what would happen. ``It's going to be voted down,'' hesaid.   Burke said the company hopes younger union members would ``sellus down the river.''   The results will not be made public until after the votes fromthe Jay mill are counted along with those cast by idled workers inDePere, Wis.; Lockhaven, Pa.; and Mobile, Ala., union leaders said.   The latest proposal came during national negotiations inLouisville, Ky., that began late last month. The details have notbeen made public.   More than 1,200 workers in Jay walked off the job June 16 in adispute over management demands for concessions involving premiumpay and work rules. Since then, IP has continued to run the millwith what it describes as permanent replacement workers.</TEXT></DOC>
