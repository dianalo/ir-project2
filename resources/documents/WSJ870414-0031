It represents the first opportunity for the Torrance, Calif.-based company to go on the offensive since its withdrawal last week of a planned stock offering in the wake of a slide in the value of its shares.    The new software product includes new features that enable the user to edit multiple columns of text, to edit whole documents as well as one page at a time, and to pull up data from a data base without shifting programs.    The product, which is priced at $565 to $595, is to begin shipments today to the company's 5,500 authorized dealers in the U.S. and Canada.    &quot;People were asking for improvements in the product,&quot; said Edward Esber Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, noting that new features sprang from discussions with the company's 500,000 customers. &quot;I would have liked to bring it out early in last year's fourth quarter,&quot; he added.    MultiMate Advantage II &quot;tells the world that we're behind this product line, and we're not going to concede market share,&quot; Mr. Esber added in an interview. With its total 1986 dollar sales of IBM and IBM-compatible word processing software at $39.5 million, he asserted that Ashton-Tate is second to market-leader Word Perfect, at $52.2 million. &quot;We're No. 2, and we hope (the new product ) will move us closer to No. 1,&quot; Mr. Esber said. The company also faces major competition from Micropro International Corp., Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.    Mr. Esber noted analysts' estimates of total Ashton-Tate sales for the current fiscal year ending next Jan. 31 range from $280 million to $300 million, compared with about $211 million last year. He declined to project profit. In the year ended last Jan. 31, Ashton-Tate earned $30.1 million, or $1.26 a share, compared with $16.6 million, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier.    What isn't clear is how much the new product can help restore luster to Ashton-Tate's stock, which tumbled 27% from a high this year of $29 a share to a low of $21.25 in March.    Yesterday, in over-the-counter trading on the national market the stock closed at $23.50 a share, down $1.25.    Ashton-Tate's stock tumble came amid uncertainty over the outlook for its dBase III product, after IBM announced an extended version of its operating system that will include building blocks for data bases. As previously reported, IBM is developing that system with Microsoft.    Mr. Esber said he expects to face continued questions today about the forthcoming IBM product. But he said uncertainty will persist because the dBase III product currently isn't expected to begin shipment until the second half of 1988.    &quot;In the long run, until we have details, it's difficult to assess,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
