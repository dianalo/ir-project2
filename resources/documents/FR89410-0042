Godcharles, 813-893-3722.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The fishery for coastal migratory pelagicfish (king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, cero, cobia, little tunny, dolphin,and, in the Gulf of Mexico only, bluefish) is managed under the FMP, preparedby the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils (Councils),and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR Part 642, under the authorityof the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act).Recent reduction of the total allowable catch (TAC) of Atlantic migratorygroup king mackerel has increased the risk of early closure of the commercialfishery. Early closures cause adverse economic impacts on traditional hookand line commercial fishermen. Amendment 3 proposes to ameliorate thispotential problem by prohibiting the use of newly introduced net gearsthat are highly efficient and capable of capturing a substantial portionof the reduced commercial allocation quickly. Prohibition of purse seines,run-around gill nets, and drift gill nets from the commercial fishery forAtlantic migratory group king mackerel would reduce the potential for earlyclosure and, thus, would protect users of traditional hook and line gear.Further, to reduce bycatch and waste, Amendment 3 would prohibit the useof drift gill nets in all fisheries for coastal migratory pelagic species.Draft Amendment 3 was prepared and distributed to interested parties inSeptember and October, 1988. Public hearings were held in 10 cities fromKey West, FL to Manteo, NC in October 1988. After considering commentsreceived at the public hearings and Council meetings, written public comments,and comments from their Scientific and Statistical Committees and AdvisoryPanels, the Councils made their final selection of preferred options atthe November/December 1988 joint meeting. The issues, their impacts, andthe rationale for the Council's preferred options are summarized below.A more complete analysis appears in Amendment 3, the availability of whichwas announced in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 11252, March 17, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>According to the 1988 mackerel stock assessment, the status of Atlanticmigratory group king mackerel is as follows: (1) Spawning stock biomassremained relatively constant through 1984, after which a decrease may haveoccurred; (2) fishing mortality rates appear to be at or slightly aboverates of full exploitation; (3) catches were high and variable from 1980to 1985, but catches in 1986 and 1987 declined; and (4) four of five datasets of catch per unit effort indicates declines in abundance. These resultsled the Councils to conclude that the Atlantic migratory group of kingmackerel is overfished.Based on the 1988 assessment, the Councils reduced TAC for the 1988/89fishing season from 9.68 million pounds to 7.0 million pounds (28 percentreduction). This reduction was based on the Councils' concern for the apparentdeclining stock and their decision to be conservative rather than riskcontinued overfishing. The resulting commercial allocation was reducedfrom 3.59 to 2.6 million pounds. This allocation was reached in November1988 and would normally have resulted in early closure of the commercialfishery. Early closures of this sort negatively impact traditional hookand line commercial participants. If purse seines, drift gill nets, andrun-around gill nets continue to be allowed in the Atlantic migratory groupking mackerel fishery, early closures are expected to occur each year.The Councils are also concerned about the waste and bycatch that occurin the drift gill net fishery.Issue 1. Purse Seines in the Atlantic Migratory Group King Mackerel FisheryCurrent regulations prohibit the use of purse seines for Gulf group kingmackerel and Atlantic and Gulf groups of Spanish mackerel because theyare overfished and the existing commercial allocations are fully utilizedby historical commercial gear types. For these species/migratory groups,the users of historical gear have had seasonal closures. Commercial allocationsfor the Atlantic migratory group of king mackerel had not been filled inthe past, though the harvest was approaching TAC. During the 1988/89 fishingseason, however, the commercial allocation was reached and the fisherywas to be closed on November 23, 1988, but remained open until February23, 1989, by court order. In addition, the Councils are concerned thatthere may be a shift of purse seine effort onto the Atlantic migratorygroup as fishermen are restricted from fishing other groups of mackerel.The Councils considered three options: Option 1 (status quo)_continue aseparate allowance (currently 400,000 pounds) for purse seines on the Atlanticmigratory group of king mackerel; Option 2_not specify a separate allowancefor purse seines but allow them to continue to fish under the commercialallocation; and Option 3_prohibit the use of purse seines on the Atlanticmigratory group of king mackerel.The Councils selected Option 3 because:1. The Atlantic migratory group of king mackerel is currently overfished.2. Allowing a new user group into an overfished fishery when historic usersare forced to reduce catches is imprudent and unfair. When stocks recoverand traditional commercial fishermen do not take the allocation, this issuewill be reconsidered.3. The use of purse seines in the fishery for Atlantic migratory groupking mackerel is of recent origin and limited in number. There is no recordof a purse seine fishery on Atlantic migratory group king mackerel beforeApri 1988 in the Ft. Pierce, FL area. Purse seine and run-around gill netstogether caught approximately 340,000 pounds of king mackerel.4. Allocating the resource to the users of traditional fishing gears benefitsthe greatest number of fishermen.5. Prohibiting the use of purse seines for mackerel is consistent withthe management regimes in all adjacent State waters.6. The marginal value of a fish allocated to the traditional commercialfishery is higher than that of a fish allocated to the purse seine fishery.Ex-vessel price information for 1987 southeast Florida landings indicatesthat hook and line-caught king mackeral usually were valued at $0.20 moreper pound than net-caught king mackerel.The number of purse seine vessels that participated in the Atlantic migratorygroup king mackerel fishery for the first time in April 1988 was very small.The number of vessels was so small that purse seine catches had to be combinedwith run-around gill net catches for presentation to avoid disclosure ofconfidential data. Using the combined purse seine and run-around gill netcatches in 1988, the prohibition would impact the affected fishermen bypreventing the harvest of approximately 340,00 pounds of king mackerel.Issue 2. Drift Gill Nets in the Coastal Migratory Pelagics FisheryCurrently, no Federal regulations specifically address this newly developedfishery. Drift entanglement nets were first tried in 1980, initially fishingthe Ft. Pierce, FL area, with little success because of shark damage tocatch and gear.By 1987 and 1988, 13 boats were using drift gill nets with catches in 1987of 800,000 pounds of Atlantic migratory group king mackerel. Preliminarycatch figures for 1988 are 808,000 pounds with final figures expected tobe higher. Nets are made of andplusmin;9 nylon webbing, have 5 inch stretchedmesh, are about 50 feet deep, and range from 1,200 to 5,000 yards long,with most full-time boats using at least 3,000 yards. During an observerprogram on vessels using this gear, no marine mammals or birds were observedtangled in the nets on any trip. Porpoises and sea turtles were observedin the vicinity of the nets on haulback and numerous trips. One leatherneckturtle was observed in the net at haulback by a fisherman; however, bythe time the observer reached the stern, the turtle freed itself and swamaway. Reports from the observer study indicate that little tunny made up23 percent of the total catch and 67poercent of the discarded bycatch,by number; barracude comprised 4 percent of the total catch and 11 percentof the discarded bycatch; and other species comprised less than 1.2 percentand 3.6 percent, respectively. There were 22 sailfish caught on observedtrips for an average of 0.58 per trip. If this is expanded for the totalnumber of drift gill net trips in 1987, the total sailfish bycatch wouldbe 419 per year. Approximately 14 percent of the total bycatch is landedand sold.The Councils considered eight options for regulating drift gill nets rangingfrom no action to a total prohibition. the Councils chose to prohibit theuse of drift gill net gear in directed fisheries for all coastal migratorypelagic resources in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico and to prohibitthe retention of these species in other drift gill net fisheries. The Councilsare concerned that they cannot adequately protect overfished king and Spanishmackerel resources if these fish are allowed to be taken as a bycatch indrift gill net fisheries for other coastal pelagic species. Currently,there is no directed drift gill net fishing for cobia, cero, little tunny,dolphin, or bluefish. Because drift gill nets are an indiscriminate gear,they cannot exclusively fish for any of these coastal pelagic species withouttaking a bycatch of king and Spanish mackerel. The shark drift net fisheryis the only fishery of which the Councils are aware that will be impactedby this prohibition on retention of all coastal migratory pelagic resources.The Councils do not have sufficient information about this fishery to evaluatethe level of impact.In this proposed rule, a drift gill net is defined by the length of itsfloat line and, in the alternative, by how it is used. Length was chosenas a determinant because of its relative ease of discernment ashore. Thelength of 1,000 yards was selected because the vast majority of drift gillnets exceed that length. The use determinant will be empoyed only for gillnets that are 1,000 yards or less in length. Drift gill nets are not, <T3>per se,</T3> prohibited_only their use to fish for coastal migratorypelagic fish or the possession of such fish aboard a vessel with a driftgill net aboard.<ITAG tagnum="81">Impacts on Commercial Hook and Line Fisheries.</ITAG> Based on drift gill net catches in 1987, a prohibition on use of driftgill nets would potentially make an additional 765,226 pounds of king mackerelavailable for harvest by the traditional commercial hook and line fisheries.How this additional catch would be distributed geographically is unknown,but in all probability the catches in the area of Ft. Pierce and southwardwould increase due to increased local availability. Also, highly valuedrecreational species taken incidentally to the mackerel drift gill netfishery would become available to the recreational fishery. The additionof 765,226 pounds of king mackerel, if caught entirely by the commercialhook and line fishery, would produce revenues of $1,078,969.<ITAG tagnum="81">Impacts on the Drift Gill Net Fishery</ITAG>Data for 1987 and preliminary data for 1988 indicate that 13 vessels andbetween 39 and 52 fishermen were engaged in the drift gill net fisheryfor Atlantic migratory group king mackerel. These vessels and fishermenalso fish (1) in the run-around gill net fishery for Gulf migratory groupking mackerel and Gulf and Atlantic migratory groups of Spanish mackereland (2) in the shark drift gill net fishery. Periodically they also fishwith smaller gill net boats (outboards) in the Indian River and outsidethe inlets. As of Septgember 1987 there were approximately 38,000 yardsof drift gill nets in the fishery worth between $194,000 and $232,800 whennew. Prohibiting this gear for coastal migratory pelagic species wouldresult in foregone catches of king mackerel of 765,226 pounds, based ondrift gill net catches in 1987. The revenue produced by this catch is estimatedat $925,923. The range of losses to the individual drift gill net vesselswould be from 3,968 to 122,987 pounds with revenues from $4,801 to $148,814.In addition, loss from other species that are landed and sold would totalapproximately 65,755 pounds with estimated revenue of $65,755 for the fisheryas a whole. Loss in value of gill nets is unknown because of uncertaintiesas to age and the amount that would not be convertible to other fisheries.The Councils selected the option of total prohibition of drift gill netsbecause:1. It most appropriately meets the objectives of the FMP, is least burdensome,and has the greatest liklihood of correcting the problem of early closureof the commercial fishery, which adversely affects traditional hook andline fishermen.2. When the quantified and non-quantified benefits are combined, a netbenefit to society results.3. It is in agreement with Florida's regulations, thereby easing enforcement.Issue 3. Run-around Gill Nets in the Atlantic Migratory Group King MackerelFisheryThe Councils considered two options: Option 1 (status quo)_continue toallow the use of run-around gill nets on Atlantic migratory group kingmackerel; and Option 2_prohibit the use of run-around gill nets to takeAtlantic migratory group king mackerel.Run-around gill nets have been used sporadically to harvest Atlantic migratorygroup king mackerel. The only recent catches were taken during April 1988.The Councils reviewed available information and chose to prohibit run-aroundgill nets for taking Atlantic migratory group king mackerel because ofthe overfished status of this group and because allowing the use of run-aroundgill nets will likely result in early closure of the commercial fishery,which would adversely impact traditional hook and line commercial participants.Further, run-around gill net gear is not considered a traditional gearin the Atlantic migratory group king mackerel fishery. This prohibitionis not being applied to Atlantic or Gulf migratory group Spanish mackerelor Gulf migratory group king mackerel because run-around gill nets areconsidered traditional gear in those fisheries. The number of run-around gill net vessels that participated in the Atlanticmigratory group king mackerel fishery for the first time in April 1988was vey small. The number of vessels was so small that run-around gillnet catches had to get combined with purse seine catches for presentationto avoid disclosure of confidential data. Using the combined run-aroundgill net and purse seine catches, the prohibition would impact the affectedfishermen by preventing the harvest of approximately 340,000 pounds ofking mackerel. In addition to the above issues, Amendment 3 also does the following: 1. Adds an objective to the FMP to minimize waste and bycatch in the fishery.Waste includes both discarded catch and economic waste due to product qualityproblems. 2. Adds to the FMP the most recent information available to the Councilsconcerning habitat. 3. Adds to the FMP an evaluation of the FMP's effects on vessel safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Changes </ITAG>In addition to the regulatory changes associated with Amendment 3, NOAAproposes changes necessary to reflect fully the previous implementationof Amendment 2 and otherwise to correct and clarify the regulations. The purpose and scope (andSection; 642.1) would be modified to express thescope of the regulations in the broadest terms consistent with the FMP.This approach avoids the possibility of misleading fishermen, dealers,processors as to the scope of the regulations in this part. To clarify what constitutes the commercial and recreational fisheries,the definition for ``<T3>Commercial fisherman</T3>'' would be removed and new definitions for``<T3>Commercial fishery</T3>'' and ``<T3>Recreational fishery</T3>'' would be added. The definition for <T3>Charter vessel</T3> would be revised to clarify that (1) a chartervessel holding either a king or Spanish mackerel commercial permit is subjectto the criteria specified for establishing when the vessel is under charterand (2) the number of persons aboard is not the sole criterion for determiningwhen a vessel is under charter. Other minor changes to some of the definitionsare proposed for clarity and consistency. The introductory texts for the reporting requirements (andSection; 642.5(a), (b), and (c)) would be revised to state more succinctly the geographicalextent of fishing for which reports may be required. In andSection; 642.5(b),reference is added to the section requiring permits for charter vesselsto add emphasis to that requirement. Other changes to these sections andto andSection; 642.5(e) are proposed for clarity. The vessel identification requirements relating to the official number(andSection; 642.6(a)) would be restated for clarity and brevity. Section 642.7(j) would be modified to correct the references in that paragraph.The prohibition of fishing for, retaining, or having in possession aboarda permitted vessel king mackerel after a closure (andSection; 642.7(k)) wouldbe clarified to include in the exceptions reference to the limited incidentalcatch of king mackerel in the Spanish mackerel gill net fishery (andSection;642.24(c)). Such incidental catch of king mackerel is not excepted fromthe prohibition on sale (andSection; 642.7(1)). Prohibited activities relating to king or Spanish mackerel under a receationalallocation after reduction of a bag limit to zero (andSection; 642.7(r))would be restated to parallel prohibited activities specified for kingor Spanish mackerel harvested on possessed in excess of a bag limit (andSection;642.7(n)).The allocations and quotas section (andSection; 642.21) would be revisedto clarify that both king and Spanish mackerel are counted against a commercialallocation when they are first sold.To express more clearly the contents of the closures section (andSection;642.22), the heading for the section would be revised by adding referenceto bag limit reductions. Section 642.22(b) would be revised to describethe geographical extent of a bag limit reduction in language parallel tothe description in the preceding paragraph of the geographical extent ofa commercial closure and to clarify that a bag limit reduction appliesto the EEZ.The catch allowance for undersized Spanish Mackerel (andSection; 642.23(a)(2))would be revised to clarify that the allowance applies only to the commercialfishery.To enforce the minimum size limits, the head and fins of Spanish mackereland cobia must be intact. The present wording of the requirement for headand fins to be intact precludes enforcement of the requirement when a vesselis boarded at sea. Accordingly, andSection; 642.23(c) would be revised torequire head and fins to be intact on any Spanish mackerel or cabia possessedin the EEZ and, when taken from the EEZ, through landing.The language regarding gill nets (andSection; 642.24(a)) would be revisedto clarify that the specified mesh sizes are the minimum allowable sizes.The purse seine catch allowance (andSection; 642.24(d)) would be revisedto clarify the the allowance is for incidental catch and the amount ofsuch catch is restated for clarity.NOAA proposes other minor, technical changes to remove redundant languageand conform to current usage.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>Section 304(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Magnuson Act, as amended by Pub. L. 99-659,requires the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to publish regulations proposedby a Council within 15 days of receipt of an FMP amendment and regulations.At this time, the Secretary has not determined that Amendment 3, whichthis proposed rule would implement, is consistent with the national standards,other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. The Secretary,in making the determination, will take into account the data, views, andcomments received during the comment period.The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, NOAA, determined that thisproposed rule is not a ``major rule'' requiring the preparation of a regulatoryimpact analysis under E.O. 12291. This proposed rule, if adopted, is notlikely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; ora significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.The Councils prepared a regulatory impact review which concludes that thisrule will have the economic effects discussed above in the analysis ofthe management measures of Amendment 3. A copy of the review may be obtainedat the address listed above. This proposed rule is exempt from the procedures of E.O. 12291 under section8(a)(2) of that order. It is being reported to the Director, Office ofManagement and Budget, with an explanation of why it is not possible tofollow the procedures of that order.The Council prepared an initial regulatory flexibility analysis as partof the regulatory impact review which concludes that this proposed rule,if adopted, would have significant effects on small entities. Thirteenvessels (small entities) would be prohibited from using drift gill netsto take any coastal migratory pelagic fish. Operators of these vesselswould have limited opportunities to use this gear in other fisheries. Incomebased on use of this gear would be lost. In addition, a small but unknownnumber of vessels (small entities) would be prohibited from using purseseines and run-around gill nets to take Atlantic group king mackerel. Thesegears have been used in other fisheries but were first actively used inthe Atlantic group king mackerel fishery during the 1987/88 fishing year.Operators of vessels with purse seines and run-around gill nets have alternatefisheries in which to use this gear. You may obtain a copy of this analysisfrom the Council at the address listed above.The Councils determined that this rule will be implemented in a mannerthat is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approvedcoastal zone management programs of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida,Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Georgia and Texas do not have approvedcoastal zone management programs. This determination has been submittedfor review by the responsible State agencies under section 307 of the CoastalZone Management Act.The Councils prepared an environmental assessment (EA) that discusses theimpact on the environment as a result of this rule. A copy of the EA maybe obtained at the address listed above and Comments on it are requested.This proposed rule does not contain a collection-of-information requirementfor purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act.This proposed rule does not contain policies with federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O.12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 642</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
