The International Energy Agency said in its Monthly Oil MarketReport that estimated production by the 13-nation Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries dipped last month from 20.2 millionbarrels a day in January.   The oil-producing nations agreed in November to slash outputstarting Jan. 1, to try to boost prices to $18 a barrel.   Since then, analysts say the oil nations have reduced the crudeflow to meet their ceiling, or quota, of 18.5 million barrels a dayin the first six months of the year.   The slowdown in output has boosted prices about $5 since lastNovember. The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPECwas $16.31 a barrel last week.   Independent oil-producing nations have also agreed to lower theirexports in the April-June quarter in an effort to kick up pricesfurther. As part of that drive, the Soviet Union on Friday announcedit would cut its exports by about 5 percent in the first half of theyear.   The Soviet Union, the world's largest crude oil producer, saidMonday the export reduction would amount to 100,000 barrels a dayand was an effort to cooperate closely with OPEC to stabilize worldoil prices.   The Soviet Union sells foreign clients an estimated 1.8 millionbarrels of oil a day.   The International Energy Agency's report estimated the world oilsupply at 49.6 million barrels a day in February, off 900,000barrels from January.   ``The reduction,'' it said, ``is due primarily to lowerproduction in several Middle Eastern countries as well as a slightproduction decline in the (Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment).'' The OECD is an organization of about two-dozenindustrialized nations.   Oil output in those nations, it said, was estimated at 16.2million barrels a day in February, down 100,000 barrels from January.   The report also said strong economic growth, especially in Japan,helped lift oil consumption in the industrialized nations to 38.8million barrels a day in the October-December quarter of 1988, upabout 5 percent from year-earlier levels.   ``Heavy fuel oil consumption increased in all regions, mainlybecause of higher demand by electric utilities,'' the report said.``In North America, there was considerable switching from naturalgas, partly because of competitively priced fuel oil.''   Oil consumption in North America, it said, was 19.7 millionbarrels a day in the fourth quarter of last year, a gain of about4.5 percent from the same period of 1987. European consumption, itsaid, advanced about 3.5 percent in the last three months of 1988.   The report estimated that oil consumption in the industrializednations would rise about 1.6 percent in the first quarter of thisyear.   ``January consumption growth was quite strong but appeared toslow in February,'' it said.   According to the agency's supply estimates, only Iran, Ecuadorand the United Arab Emirates appeared to be producing in Februaryabove the levels set for individual OPEC countries last November.   Iran's output was estimated at 2.7 million barrels a day inFebruary, compared with its quota of 2.6 million barrels.   The United Arab Emirates produced about 1.6 million barrels aday, well above its target of 988,000 barrels. Ecuador was measuredat roughly 300,000 barrels a day, compared with its quota of 230,000barrels.   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, produced anestimated 4.5 million barrels a day in February, the same as itsquota. Its daily output was roughly 4.8 million barrels in January.   OPEC released figures late last month that showed membercountries complying in January with the new output accord. It said adozen of its members supplied a total of 17.42 million barrels a dayin January, just under the combined quota for those countries of17.51 million barrels.   OPEC said it measures a nation's quota by figuring crudeproduction and the amount of oil put into, or drawn out, of stocks.   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United ArabEmirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
