The wronged wife in what's being called the ``Love and theIntefadeh'' affair appeared as a blacked-out figure on the eveningTV news to support her husband's story that he was really trying torecruit the dark-haired Arab woman as an informer.   The story of Capt. Avi Marak and 20-year-old Abir Mattar has hitnewspaper front pages this weekend largely because with the wall ofhatred that has grown between Jews and Arabs in the Intefadeh _ oruprising _ such a romance seems unthinkable.   A military source Sunday confirmed that Marak, who was a companycommander for Israel's military government in the occupied WestBank, is being investigated on suspicion of ``inappropriatebehavior.''   According to Israeli newspapers, Marak held nightly secretrendezvous with the young woman from the Christian village of BeitJallah near Bethlehem for between four and eight months.   They usually spent their time together in military jeeps orpickup trucks, the reports said.   The trysts ended after Marak's wife, Ricky, found out, theMaariv daily said. Early one morning, Mrs. Marak went to the homeof the Palestinian woman, who also is married, and the two got intoa scuffle, according to news reports. The captain then hauled hiswife off in a jeep, the reports said.   But the shadowy figure on the evening news backed her husband'sstory that he was recruiting an informer to act againstPalestinians involved in the 27-month-old uprising against Israelioccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   After saying some unpleasant things about Mrs. Mattar'sreputation, Mrs. Marak added: ``This is a relation based on(military) security.''   She said her husband ``never told me anything because he doesn'tlet me in on military affairs.''   Marak, who is still being questioned after removal from his postearlier this month, told Maariv that he had been seeking aninformer. Other newspapers noted Mrs. Mattar's family had areputation of assisting Israeli authorities.   Mrs. Mattar was quoted as saying she wants to divorce herhusband, who is in jail for attempted murder, and marry Marak.   ``We are happy together,'' she told the Yediot Ahronot daily.``When Avi divorces his wife, I will also get a divorce and convertto marry him.''   Mrs. Marak told newspapers she hopes to keep her marriageintact. On television, she said she saw her husband's story asmaterial for a television script she has been writing as a hobby.   ``I am putting this all in the script,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
