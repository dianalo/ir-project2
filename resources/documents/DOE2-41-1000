Coal fired powergeneration is estimated to contribute approximately 11% of the man-madeCO{sub 2}, and 6% of the total man-made radiative gases entering theatmosphere. The 6% contribution that CO{sub 2} emission from the world'scoal fired power stations makes to the greenhouse effect is seen to beminor, and it is considered that it will remain minor even with the envisagedgrowth of coal in this area. 15 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
