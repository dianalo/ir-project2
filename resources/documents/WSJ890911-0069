In the latest sign that marketers are catching on, 1,200 supermarkets plan to stop selling produce treated with known or probable cancer-causing pesticides. The ban, to be phased in by 1995, is part of &quot;Pesticide Reduction Goals,&quot; to be announced at news conferences today in Washington, D.C., Sacramento, Calif., and Phoenix, Ariz. The project is being orchestrated by the National Toxics Campaign Fund, an environmental group.    Other steps include requiring all produce suppliers to identify the pest-control substances they use, sharply limiting the acceptable levels of pesticides known to cause nerve damage, and carrying organically grown produce whenever possible.    With total sales of about $8 billion a year, the stores account for only a small percentage of national supermarket sales of almost $300 billion. But the move is part of a broader effort to use product safety as a marketing tool, and the anti-pesticide pledge is only the latest example of safety-related marketing.    Last week, three chemical companies said they would scale back sales of a popular fungicide, ethylene bisdithiocarbamate, or EBDC, which is one of the chemicals to be banned by the supermarkets.    Last month, several supermarket chains decided against selling milk and other dairy products from cows treated with a genetically engineered bovine growth hormone until the Food and Drug Administration completes safety studies.    &quot;People have realized that there is a hypersensitivity on the part of consumers to a lot of health-related concerns,&quot; says Bill Bishop, the president of a food-industry consulting firm in Chicago.    The supermarkets involved -- Bread andamp; Circus Wholefood Supermarkets in Massachusetts, Petrini Meat Inc. in San Rafael, Calif., Raley's in Sacramento, Abco Markets in Phoenix and Provigo Inc. in Montreal -- seem sure to come under attack from food producers. In a news conference today, four food-industry trade associations are expected to criticize the pesticide project for needlessly alarming consumers.    Moreover, actions such as those by the supermarket chains don't involve positive marketing steps as much as damage control, says Mr. Bishop, the consultant. After reports earlier this year linked the apple pesticide Alar to cancer risks in children, supermarkets had to act &quot;to head off a flap,&quot; he says. Some began posting signs and placing ads assuring customers that their produce was Alar-free. &quot;It was a way to manage negative publicity, but I don't think it produced a lot of positive marketing benefits,&quot; Mr. Bishop says.    Companies can run into trouble even with positive marketing. Recently, sales of oatmeal have soared in response to claims about its cholesterol-reducing effects. But last week, Texas sued Quaker Oats Co., charging that its oatmeal and oat bran ads falsely claim that eating the cereal cuts cholesterol and the risk of heart attacks. The FDA is preparing to send a letter to several companies raising questions about psyllium, an ingredient that is supposed to help reduce cholesterol.    Promoters of the supermarket pesticide project see their plan as a positive appeal to consumer concerns. In addition to EBDC, the chemicals to be banned include alachlor, the most widely used field-crop herbicide, and captan, which is used on a variety of fruits and vegetables. </TEXT></DOC>
