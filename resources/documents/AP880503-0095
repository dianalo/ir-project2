NBC's ``Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,'' with Mel Gibson and TinaTurner, trailed the group with a 9.2 percent rating and 14 percentshare.   Magnum ended its eight-year, 162-episode run with a two-hourspecial called ``Resolutions,'' in which the crime-fightingHawaiian detective rejoins the Navy and discovers hishalf-Vietnamese daughter is alive.
