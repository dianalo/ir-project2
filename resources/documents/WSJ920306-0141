Early estimates of February's results for the Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries show that production stillis running as much as one million barrels a day above thetargeted ceiling. March output also is expected to be higher-- perhaps by several hundred thousand barrels a day -- thanthe production level that the oil ministers set at theirGeneva meeting last month.</LP><TEXT>   There is evidence, nevertheless, that production is comingdown, with Saudi Arabia, the OPEC kingpin, making substantialcuts to lead the way. Some oil economists suggest the cutswill be enough to hold prices near current levels and helpthe exporters get through the usual seasonal slackening ofoil demand in the second quarter.   &quot;If they really try to stick to their agreement andproduce around 23 million barrels a day, oil markets shouldstabilize,&quot; said Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, chief economist forAshland Oil Inc.   The new ceiling was established by the oil ministers attheir Geneva meeting to prop up prices that had been erodedby the highest OPEC production in more than a decade. Theaverage price of the basket of seven crudes used as an OPECreference has declined since then, dropping to $16.66 abarrel last week from $16.73 the preceding week. Butgenerally oil prices appear to be leveling off.   The OPEC average usually lags behind the price of the U.S.benchmark crude -- West Texas Intermediate, or WTI -- by some$2 a barrel. Yesterday, the futures price of a lightlow-sulfur crude similar to WTI settled on the New YorkMercantile Exchange at $18.55 a barrel, down eight cents abarrel.   Oil experts agree, meanwhile, that OPEC's production begancoming down in the last half of February. But even thoughoutput was lower in that period than in the first half of themonth, it remained relatively high. Production in the firsthalf of March also is expected to exceed the daily outputgoal of 23 million barrels.   Cristina Haus, a New York-based consultant who monitorsOPEC production for oil industry publications, estimates thatlast month's output averaged 24.2 million barrels a day,marginally lower than January's 24.3 million barrels. &quot;Iranand Nigeria hadn't cut yet,&quot; she noted, &quot;although Nigeriasince has claimed cutbacks.&quot;   Energy Security Analysis Inc., which tracks supplies ofoil world-wide, pegs OPEC's February production at slightlymore than 24 million barrels a day, with Saudi Arabiaaveraging about 8.5 million barrels a day and Iran about 3.4million to 3.5 million. Total OPEC output for the last halfof the month, and probably even now, is estimated at 23.7million barrels daily by the Washington-based firm.   So far, most of the cuts have come from Saudi Arabia.Saudi officials confirmed last month that early in Februarytheir output was near capacity, generally estimated at ninemillion barrels a day. But they pledged to reduce output toeight million barrels a day from the 8.5 million they hadclaimed as their market share.   Cyril Malak, an analyst for Energy Security Analysis, saidindications are that Saudi Arabia pushed its production up to8.9 million barrels a day just prior to the OPEC meeting inpart to strengthen the kingdom's hand in an expected face-offwith Iran. An Iranian-Saudi rift did develop over Iran'sclaims it was producing 3.6 million barrels a day and overthe Saudis' refusal to reduce their output below eightmillion.   Leslie Owens of Petroleum Economics Ltd., a London-basedconsulting firm that also monitors OPEC production, expectstotal output for the 13 members to average 23.1 millionbarrels a day this month. Other estimates of March productionrange between 23.2 million and 23.4 million barrels a day.   OPEC output even at the higher end of the range shouldprovide some support to oil markets, however. That's becausea glut of oil in storage -- or inventory &quot;overhang&quot; -- maynot be as big as many had believed. North America may havetoo much oil for its needs, but supplies elsewhere appear tobe in balance with demand.   Lawrence Goldstein, president of the Petroleum IndustryResearch Foundation, has slightly higher estimates thanothers for OPEC's output so far this year. He placedproduction as high as 24.5 million barrels a day in Januaryand at around the same level for the first half of February.For the second half of last month, production was close to 24million barrels, he said.   In March, however, cuts should total around one millionbarrels a day on average for the month, according to Mr.Goldstein. At least half the cuts should come from SaudiArabia, he said. But Iran remains a question mark.   &quot;There's just not much evidence of any cutbacks fromIran,&quot; Mr. Goldstein said. Still, he said, &quot;the{supply/demand} fundamentals are more supportive than thepsychology of the market.&quot; He believes prices shouldstabilize in a range of $18 to $20 a barrel for WTI.</TEXT></DOC>
