White</HL><DATE>01/08/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14</SO><IN>BANKS (BNK)STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)</IN><GV>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)</GV><LP>   The failure of the Bank of New England has made a big dentin the remaining net assets of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., as a new idea has surfaced in Washington forreplenishing the fund: All banks would be required to buyamounts of &quot;preferred stock&quot; in the FDIC equal to 1% of theirdomestic deposits, and they could carry this stock at par ontheir balance sheets.   This idea has a great deal of surface appeal. Theinsurance fund would receive an immediate infusion of about$25 billion. The banks would receive dividends on their&quot;investment.&quot; More important, since they could carry theirpreferred stock as an asset on their balance sheets at itsoriginal par value -- at least until the day that theinsurance fund is forced to dip into this money -- the banks'accounting net worths (capital) would not be immediatelydiminished. The banks can have their cake, and eat it too.</LP><TEXT>   As is usually the case at such cakefests, however, closerexamination reveals that the claimed results are too good tobe true. The preferred stock plan cannot simultaneouslystrengthen the insurance fund and avoid diminishing thebanks' true (market value) net worths. It is outrightdouble-counting to permit the insurance fund to include thebanks' $25 billion contribution in its resources while thebanks continue to carry the preferred stock at its par valueof $25 billion.   To see this point, it is important to realize that thereare two sources of financial protection for the insurancefund: the net assets of the fund itself, and the net worthsof its members. If the latter is dependent on the former,then we cannot simply look at the two financial pools as ifthey were full and separate strengths for the fund. If theinsurance fund exhausts its other resources and has to dipinto the $25 billion, then the value of the banks' preferredstock would clearly be diminished -- as would their networths. Thus, at that point every dollar of reduction in theinsurance fund's net assets would also be a dollar reductionin the banks' net worths -- a double reduction in thefinancial protection available to the fund.   There is another way of making this point: To carry thepreferred stock as an asset at par value is to ignore thecontingent liability represented by the likelihood that theinsurance fund may need to use some or all of the $25 billionto cover the costs of disposing of insolvent banks.   This proposal thus represents yet anothersmoke-and-mirrors approach to dealing with a seriousfinancial problem. Since such approaches have a long (andundistinguished) lineage in Washington, the surfacing of thisone probably should not come as a huge surprise. Still, it isdistressing that the recent history of deposit insurancefunds has not encouraged greater skepticism toward such&quot;easy&quot; solutions. In an important sense, this proposal, andthe seriousness with which it is being discussed inWashington, is a testament to the power that the historicalcost-based accounting framework continues to have in theworld of bank regulation and to the deceptions anddistortions that can accompany this framework.   There is a second reason why this proposal is a bad idea:We hear constantly about the current widespread concern thatthe U.S. economy is facing a credit crunch, that banks arebeing too restrictive in their commercial lending. TheFederal Reserve's recent action to reduce banks' reserverequirements was aimed at stimulating such lending. Thiswould be an odd time indeed to force the banks to contracttheir existing assets (some of which would surely becommercial loans) by $25 billion in order to force them tobuy the preferred stock (the proceeds of which wouldimmediately be invested in Treasury securities).   If, despite these defects, the proposal is implemented,there is a partial remedy for the double-counting problem:Let the preferred stock be publicly held and traded (or,even, let it be tradable just among banks), and require thebanks to carry it on their balance sheets at the currentmarket values revealed by such trading. This is only apartial remedy, since progressive deterioration of thefinancial strength of the insurance fund (if it wereunanticipated by the market) would still cause a progressivedeterioration of the banks' assets and net worths.Nevertheless, the current market value of the stock would, atany given time, reveal the market's best guess as to thevalue of that asset as a protection for the fund.   It is not possible to tap the banks to strengthen theinsurance fund without weakening the banks. Any scheme thatclaims otherwise is truly relying on blue smoke and mirrors.   ---   Mr. White, a professor of economics at New York UniversityStern school of business, is the author of &quot;The Sandamp;L Debacle,&quot;to be published this year by Oxford University Press.</TEXT></DOC>
