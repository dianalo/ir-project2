Getty, a Jericho, N.Y., marketer of gasoline and other petroleum products, had said it intended to join the bidding for Clark's assets. Clark's parent, Apex Oil Co., a closely held St. Louis oil company, has been operating under federal bankruptcy law since December.    Horsham Corp., Toronto, previously proposed to buy Apex notes with a face value of $545 million at a 27% discount, or about $396 million. The investment company also will assume $60 million of other debt and lay out another $45 million of cash.    Stephen Salzman, Getty senior vice president, said Getty's offer provides for these terms plus an additional $50 million cash. The federal bankruptcy court in St. Louis must approve any bid.    The main assets involved in the bidding include 1,000 gasoline stations in Ohio and west of the state and two Illinois refineries, Mr. Salzman said.    &quot;Ohio is contiguous with our marketing area, and we have said we want to grow within&quot; or contiguous to current operations, Mr. Salzman said. &quot;It's a good fit for our operation.&quot;    With no refinery capacity, Getty purchases gasoline from domestic and foreign refiners. Mr. Salzman said the Clark refineries would give the company 50% of its total gasoline needs. The distance of the Illinois refineries from headquarters on Long Island wouldn't be a problem: &quot;Logistically, (the purchase) would work out well for us,&quot; the executive said.    Also included are terminals and pipelines, plus miscellaneous assets not related to the industry, including a ski resort.    In June 1987, Getty agreed to buy a different set of assets for about $400 million plus assumption of about $47 million in liabilities. The transaction fell through a month later when the two sides couldn't agree on final terms.    A source close to Horsham has said the company wants the assets mainly to offset its exposure to gold prices through its 21.7% voting stake in American Barrick Resources Corp. &quot;Apex is counter-cyclical to Horsham's main investment,&quot; the source said.    The stake in Barrick, one of North America's largest gold producers, is Horsham's primary asset. Peter Munk, the Toronto gold-mining investor, is Barrick's founder, chairman and chief executive officer and Horsham's chairman.    Mr. Munk has long been interested in the oil business. Barrick's predecessor, Barrick Petroleum Corp., was formed in 1981 as an oil and gas concern. But Mr. Munk saw bigger opportunities in gold mining and later sold off Barrick's oil assets.    He also has a longstanding relationship with two Apex principals, P. Anthony Novelly and Samuel Goldstein. Mr. Novelly resigned as a director of Horsham's board in June, when Horsham embarked on its offer for the assets. </TEXT></DOC>
