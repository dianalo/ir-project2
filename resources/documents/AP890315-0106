The guerrillas were captured and wounded.   A military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 3a.m. attack failed when a grenade hurled at the Israeli camp rolledback onto the guerrillas' position and exploded, injuring the twoArabs. Soldiers opened fire after hearing an explosion.   No Israeli soldiers were hurt. The attack came on the day Israelwithdrew from the Red Sea resort of Taba and handed sovereignty toEgypt.   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, head of Israel's southern command,said the guerrillas belong to a fundamentalist group known as JihadIslami, or Islamic Holy War.   The guerrillas, aged 15 and 17, carried Soviet-made automaticAK-47 rifles, a Swedish-made Karl Gustav submachine gun and sixSoviet F1 hand grenades, the army said. It said the teen-agers werefrom the Canada Palestinian refugee camp in Egypt.   Sources who demanded anonymity said a third person, perhapsacting as a scout, slipped back across the border and avoidedcapture.   Mordechai said the attack was carried out with the knowledge ofPLO chief Yasser Arafat and his Fatah guerrillas.   ``To the best of our knowledge, the ring was prepared and trainedin the Canada refugee camp in Egyptian Rafah and from there theywent with a scout to our territory,'' he said.   ``According to the terrorists being questioned, the ring actedand was sent by Jihad Islami. (They went) with the knowledge ofFatah, and with the knowledge of Abu Ammar (Arafat).''   Israel radio said the goal of the guerrillas was to killsoldiers, take hostages and return to Egypt. The guerrillas werepromised $20,000 for making the attack, it claimed.   The last infiltration from Egypt came on Dec. 29, when Israelisoldiers shot and killed three men who crossed the border. It wasnot known if the infiltrators were smugglers or guerrillas.   In March 1988, three Palestinians crossed the Egyptian border andhijacked a bus. They killed three Israeli civilians before they wereshot to death. The PLO's Force 17 unit claimed responsibility.   Today's infiltration came amid reported efforts by U.S. officialsto work out a cease-fire between Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization to stop infiltrations from Lebanon.   Army officials estimate about 30 guerrillas have been killed insouth Lebanon during infiltration attempts since the beginning ofthe year.   The United States has asked the PLO to halt such attacks. But thePLO said attacks on military targets were not included when Arafatrenounced terrorism last December.</TEXT></DOC>
