At present, belt conveyorhaulage capacity and belt widths are adapted to peak excavator capacity.Excavator production measurements are provided showing that peak bulkvolume (about 3 times the average bulk flow at bucket wheel excavators)is reached in the least part of operation time. Furthermore, observationsof bucket wheel excavator operation showed belt conveyor empty run at11% of operation time due to excavator idle run (average 8 s to morethan 3 min, related to cutting, start-up, repair, etc.). These factorsthus lower utilization degree and efficiency of belt conveyor systems.It is concluded that process automation should be used to stabilize continuityof bulk production and that belt conveyor size should be oriented toaverage bulk flow from excavator. Economic advantages of operating smallerboom spreaders (2.00 and 2.25 m belt widths) to larger equipment (2.50m belt width) are outlined as an example. (MOS).</TEXT></DOC>
