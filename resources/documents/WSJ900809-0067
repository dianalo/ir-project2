White   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>08/09/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C10</SO><CO>   LABOR GM</CO><IN>AUTOMOBILES (AUT)</IN><LP>   DETROIT -- A strike over local grievances at a GeneralMotors Corp. parts-making plant in Flint, Mich., could forceshutdowns at as many as eight GM car and truck assemblyplants within two days, the company said.   The almost immediate impact of this local walkout on GM'soperations demonstrates how vulnerable the Big Three automakers will be should contract talks with the United AutoWorkers union fail to produce a new national contract by theSept. 14 strike deadline.</LP><TEXT>   The Flint parts plant is a &quot;key&quot; operation for GM becauseit supplies gas tanks and certain other critical componentsto a majority of GM's North American assembly plants,including those that build some of the company's mostprofitable luxury car lines, a GM spokesman said. It's notclear yet how deeply the strike will cut into GM'sproduction, he said.   But GM President Lloyd E. Reuss, at an industry conferencein Traverse City, Mich., expressed concern that GM could losemomentum in the market because the company has relativelylean inventories of new cars. &quot;The marketplace doesn't waitany more,&quot; Mr. Reuss said.   Union officials said the walkout yesterday morning at anAC Rochester division plant in Flint was a reaction bymembers of United Auto Workers union local 659 to&quot;longstanding local grievances&quot; over work practices, healthand safety issues, and subcontracting of work outside theplant.   But GM's plan to shut a portion of the factory by 1992 andlay off about 600 of the 2,800 union workers there is &quot;a bigemotional issue&quot; behind the walkout, one UAW official said.Union leaders were quick to draw the parallel between theFlint situation and the broader grievances about GM plantclosings and layoffs that are a focus of the national talks.   &quot;The company's uncooperative stance (at AC Rochester) doesreveal the very insensitivity and lack of respect for itswork force that we have said must be addressed throughout thecorporation,&quot; said Stephen P. Yokich, UAW vice president.   In effect, the AC Rochester strike is a warning to all theBig Three U.S. auto makers that the UAW won't have to expendits resources on a mass walkout to cripple a target automaker's operations this autumn.   GM, like Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., no longerwarehouses large inventories of parts to supply assemblyoperations. Instead, many parts-making plants build and shipcomponents to assembly plants on a &quot;just-in-time&quot; basis.   This practice cuts inventory carrying costs. But it alsomeans that any disruption in the supply lines quicklytranslates into lost output. When Canadian truckers blockedbridges between Ontario and Michigan in May, the cutoff inthe flow of parts forced production cuts at nine Big Threefacilities.   Negotiations to settle the dispute are scheduled to resumetoday, UAW and GM officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
