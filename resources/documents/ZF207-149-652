Page, chief of IRMS' Authorizations and Management ReviewsDivision, said open telecommunications DPAs for Energy, HHS, Justice andState were canceled because FTS 2000 can satisfy their telecommunicationsrequirements.andM;The canceled DPAs were for Energy's commercial carrier procurement, HHS'Department Information Management Exchange System, Labor's intercity servicesprocurement, Justice's resources procurement to support itstelecommunications network and its proposed interim network and State'sintegrated domestic telecommunications network.andM;GSA top officials approved all decisions.andP;  GSA now has canceled nine of the19 open DPAs suspended in February, and GSA also will review ADP DPAs issuedsince December to ensure all embedded telecommunications requirements aresatisfied by FTS 2000.andM;&quot;In many cases agencies will cancel the whole [request for proposals] andsimply use FTS 2000,&quot; Page said.andP;  &quot;We're proceeding to review those where wesee potential [for FTS 2000] and we'll follow a similar pattern on thosedecisions.&quot;andM;As for the exemptions, Page said GSA reinstated DPAs for the FederalCommunications Commission's multipoint dedicated transmission service andHHS' local service procurement for a carrier between the Indian HealthService Hospital in Sacaton, Ariz., and the Indian Health hospital inPhoenix.andP;  In both cases GSA determined FTS 2000 could not meet agency needsand allowed them to proceed with their procurements.andM;Amendments IssuedandM;GSA granted amended DPAs to the departments of Housing and Urban Development,HHS, Interior, State and Veterans Affairs.andP;  The amendments allow agencies toobtain non-FTS 2000 services until such services are available through thegovernment network.andM;The amended DPAs were for Interior's GEONET project, HHS' IntegratedInformation Processing Service, State's Global Telecommunications Networkwithin the continental United States and the VA's Integrated DataCommunications Utility.andM;Page said all agencies know that the FTS 2000 network is mandatory and theDPA decisions came as no surprise.andP;  He said agencies understand the situationand no appeals are expected.andM;&quot;In general, agencies were cooperative,&quot; Page said.andP;  &quot;The word we use is thatthey agreed with out determinations.andP;  They can read the law just like we do.andO;Unless they have a requirement that will not allow them to use the FTS 2000network it is really pretty much [decided].&quot;andM;&quot;We think GSA has worked with us very well and the outcome is cost-effectiveand means we won't be wasting resources,&quot; said Brooks Dickerson, deputydirector of HUD's Office Information Policies and Systems.andP;  &quot;The meetings,although intense, were very professional.andP;  Everyone worked together.&quot;andM;Page also said GSA has not finished its review of the TransportationDepartment's suspended DPA.andP;  The DPA is for the Federal AviationAdministration's packet switched network known as the National Airspace DataInterchange Network.andM;Meanwhile GSA is continuing to meet with the Defense Department officialsabout DOD's participation in FTS 2000.andP;  DOD had no open DPAs but Pentagonofficials have treated the existing telecommunications Statement of Areas ofUnderstanding as a blanket exemption.andP;  Page said DOD has special securityconcerns that must be worked out and there is no deadline for a decision.andM;The amended DPAs indicate GSA will be updating the FTS 2000 contract.andP;  Whilespeaking at a GSA conference on emerging issues in Washington last month,Michael Corrigan, IRMS' deputy commissioner for telecommunications services,said GSA will work with agencies to transfer their requirements to the newnetwork as services become available.andM;He said the key is to change with the technology and avoid the obsolescenceproblems of the old FTS network.andM;&quot;The intent is to not let FTS 2000 become obsolete and recognize as long asit is the long-distance service provider changes must be provided in the10-year scope of the contract,&quot; Corrigan said.andM;&quot;Ten years in the telecommunications industry is a long time.andP;  To expect FTS2000 to be stable would be to guarantee its obsolescence.andP;  Certainly we had aproblem [with that] under the old FTS network and the intent is to avoid it.andO;The basic issue to work out is the vehicle used to do it.&quot;andM;Francis A. McDonough, deputy IRMS commissioner, urged agencies to meet withGSA as soon as possible to plan transitions.andP;  He said FTS 2000 is mandatoryand agencies should not wait until their current contracts expire to beginthinking about shifting to FTS 2000.andP;  &quot;Talk with the transition team [headedby Corrigan] as soon as possible so everything is understood and can be givenauthorizations for unique requirements,&quot; McDonough said.andM;&quot;The exemption procedure is in draft regulation.andP;  Any disputes go to OMB [theOffice of Management and Budget] where GSA and the agency can debate theissue in front of them.andP;  But there's lots of room to go to Pat Szervo [IRMScommissioner] and Dick Austin [GSA administrator] first,&quot; McDonough said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
