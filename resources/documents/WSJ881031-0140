A panel of the General Services Administration's Board of Contract Appeals on Friday rejected a complaint from GM's Hughes Aircraft Co. unit that the Federal Aviation Administration acted improperly in July when it awarded IBM the contract to overhaul the country's aging air traffic control ground computers.    Friday's decision was a severe blow to Hughes, the loser in the original bid contest. The so-called Advanced Automation System contract is the biggest ever awarded by the FAA, and is the cornerstone of a proposed $12 billion, 10-year air traffic control system modernization campaign.    Hughes had complained that the FAA showed favoritism toward IBM during the bidding process and ignored evidence that Hughes's system, while more costly by $700 million, was significantly better than IBM's.    &quot;We are deeply disappointed,&quot; a Hughes spokesman said Friday. &quot;We firmly believe our company developed superior technological and business solutions to air traffic control, and we will continue to pursue opportunities in that field.&quot;    The fight over the contract may not be over, however. Hughes has 120 days to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington. But the company hadn't said as of yesterday whether it would take its case to the court.    Meanwhile, IBM and the FAA said they were pleased with the decision, and eager to resume work under the contract, which had been suspended by the GSA board on Aug. 10. The GSA board immediately lifted the suspension last Friday and an IBM spokesman said the Armonk, N.Y., company will begin work on the project whenever it is practical to do so.    Hughes had gambled that it could win the Advanced Automation System contract with a highly advanced, showcase system that would track aircraft, monitor the weather and deliver information to air traffic controllers on color, high-resolution computer screens.    But after their showcase system lost the bid, Hughes filed a scorching protest with the GSA. Hughes charged the FAA with violating its own rules in a variety of ways to give IBM breaks during the bidding process. In the most sensational allegation, Hughes accused IBM of using its position as a subcontractor to inflate the Hughes bid. IBM, Hughes charged, quoted prices to Hughes for certain equipment that were more than $280 million higher than the prices IBM quoted for the same equipment in its own bid to the FAA. IBM has maintained that the charges are without merit.    The GSA board rejected all of Hughes's claims of FAA favoritism, and found that Hughes failed to make a case that IBM had acted improperly in its role as a subcontractor. As for the technology issue, the GSA board ruled that in light of the fact that Hughes's system cost $700 million more than IBM's, the FAA &quot;reasonably determined that (Hughes's) advanced, and unproven, technology was not worth the price the (FAA) would have to pay.&quot;    The announcement of the GSA action came after the market closed Friday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, IBM stock closed at $120.75, up 50 cents, and GM's Class H stock closed at $29.625, off 12.5 cents. The Class H stock represents a dividend interest in the earnings of GM Hughes Electronics Corp., which includes Hughes Aircraft.    ---   Laurie McGinley contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
