The move came in response to a petition by Johnson andamp; Johnson, which says it is the leader in the &quot;wound-closure market,&quot; and American Cyanamid Co. that the FDA reconsider its decision last September to reclassify absorbable surgical gut suture from the most stringent category, Class III, to Class II.    A spokeswoman for United States Surgical Corp., which had petitioned the FDA to reclassify six types of sutures, including absorbable catgut, said the reclassification significantly shortens the time it typically takes to gain FDA approval to market a product, from several years to 90 days. She added U.S. Surgical expects to market its sutures in the first half of 1990; it already makes surgical staples.    Catgut sutures represent about 15% of the market, while synthetic absorbables represent about one-third of the market, according to the United States Surgical spokeswoman. She estimated the suture market world-wide in 1988 was about $1.1 billion.    A spokesman for Johnson andamp; Johnson, a health-care products concern based in New Brunswick, N.J., said the company disagrees with the agency's decision. He said the company doesn't break out suture sales. A spokeswoman for American Cynamid, a Wayne, N.J., biotechnology and chemicals company, said catgut sutures are basically a commodity suture that many companies make and that Cyanamid has &quot;no significant competitive advantage.&quot;    United States Surgical, based in Norwalk, Conn., said it hopes to gain reclassification of the other sutures soon. </TEXT></DOC>
