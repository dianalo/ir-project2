Long-time rival Iraq is challenging Assad in Lebanon, his ownbackyard, and more broadly in the Arab world. Moderate Arab leaderslike President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt are lining up to curb Assad'sinfluence in Lebanon.   At the same time, the Palestinian uprising in Israeli-heldterritories has bolstered another rival, Yasser Arafat of thePalestine Liberation Organization, and likely weakened Syria's rolein the Middle East peace process.   Assad, however, has proven himself a strong and agile leadersince he came to power in a 1970 coup. He has suffered setbacksbefore, and managed to come out ahead.   The ideological feud between Syria and Iraq, one of the mostbitter inter-Arab vendettas, has been rekindled by the Aug. 20cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. Assad had been Persian Iran's mainArab ally against a fellow Arab.   Other Arabs bitterly criticized Assad for siding with Iran, eventhough he argued that the alliance gave Syria leverage that helpedkeep the conflict from spreading, a claim most Arabs question.   Meanwhile, Iran's military collapse, which forced it to acceptthe United Nations-sponsored cease-fire, has enhanced the militaryand political prestige of the Iraqi leader, President SaddamHussein, who sees himself as having saved the Arab world fromAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution.   Secular Syria and Islamic-fundamentalist Iran have little incommon, except a hatred of Saddam. Syria and Iraq are ruled by rivalwings of the Baath Arab Socialist Party.   Jordan and Saudi Arabia got Assad and Saddam together last year,but the reconciliation effort was short-lived.   Iraq's state-controlled media daily savages Assad as a ``traitorto the Arab nation'' and ``the slave of the imposters in Tehran.''Syria's equally controlled press hurls the insults right back.   In Lebanon, its unruly western neighbor, Syria's interests nowseem to be particularly at risk.   Syria, which considers itself the main power broker there, hasfailed to control the Lebanese Christians and get a pro-Syrianpresident elected to succeed Amin Gemayel, whose 6-year term expiredSept. 23.   Gemayel, a Maronite Catholic, stepped down without a successorelected by Parliament because of a boycott by the Christians, whoopposed pro-Syrian candidates, the only serious contenders. TheLebanese government now has split in two, and Iraq has been armingthe Christians' main militia, the Lebanese Forces.   The crisis has deepened the partition of Lebanon, split intoChristian and Moslem cantons during the 13-year-old civil war, andmade the prospects of a Syrian-sponsored settlement, a cornerstoneof Assad's foreign policy, even more distant.   It has also undercut the Syrian claim to be the sole Arab arbiterin Lebanon, which other countries have never really disputed untilnow.   Arafat, Saddam Hussein, Jordan's King Hussein and Mubarak,another foe of Assad's because of Cairo's 1979 peace treaty withIsrael, recently formed a new alliance and called for an emergencyArab summit on Lebanon.   Mubarak, noting that a Pan-Arab effort was needed to saveLebanon, stressed that ``there is no time for indulgence incourtesies toward Syria or other countries.''   Elsewhere in the region, the 11-month-old Palestinian uprising inthe Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip has eclipsed Assad'sefforts to wrench control of the Palestinian cause from Arafat.   The uprising has dramatically shifted the focus of thePalestinian cause from the refugee camps in Lebanon, where Syria'sproxies fought for years to crush Arafat's forces, to the occupiedterritories where Assad is powerless to intervene.   Arafat's men were forced out of camps in Beirut by Syrian-backedPalestinian dissidents, heavily reinforced by Syrian soldiersdisguised as guerrillas.   But Arafat still has strongholds in south Lebanon and, alliedwith Iraq, his strength has been bolstered by the uprising.   This has robbed Assad of any chance of being able to deliver thePalestinian card in a Middle East peace settlement, dimming theprospects of regaining the Golan Heights that Israel captured fromSyria in 1967.   Arafat's PLO is expected shortly to win approval from thePalestine National Council, or parliament in exile, to declare aPalestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza with a provisionalgovernment.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Ed Blanche, formerly based in Lebanon, nowfollows developments in the Arab World and Iran from the AP's MiddleEast listening post on Cyprus.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs Nov. 14</NOTE></DOC>
