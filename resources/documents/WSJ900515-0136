The article,and the fact that it appeared in The Wall Street Journal ofall places, no doubt is as cheering to the Kremlin as it isdepressing for the embattled Lithuanians.   Mr. Kristol states he is confused by Mikhail Gorbachev'spolicies and actions with regard to Lithuania. I don't findthem confusing. They change by the moment because Mr.Gorbachev is a consummate opportunist and politician whosubscribes to communist ideology. Thus, he will do whateverit takes to achieve the desired results (maintaining Sovietpower as well as his own) while not disturbing the balance ofpower within the various factions of his own government or inthe West.</LP><TEXT>   Most offensive is Mr. Kristol's assertion that &quot;Lithuaniais not a lucky country&quot; and the conclusion that independenceis impossible for &quot;the foreseeable future,&quot; as if &quot;luck&quot; hadanything to do with the principles that should guide Americanactions toward a small nation that so closely shares ourideals.   The desperate state of the Soviet economy and growingunrest in other parts of the Soviet empire imply that no one,certainly not Mr. Kristol, knows what will happen there.There are a number of scenarios under which Lithuanianindependence is not only possible, but probable. One of themis the scenario under which Lithuania receives strong moraland diplomatic support from the West.   Ann Donnelly   Vancouver, Wash.   ---   I was stung by Mr. Kristol's article. As a recentLithuanian-American traveler and business consultant in theU.S.S.R., I am highly motivated to respond:   First, his comparison of Vietnam to Lithuania isludicrous. In Vietnam there was a civil war between opposingfactions. Lithuania had enjoyed centuries of independenceprior to the Soviet takeover of its sovereignty.   Second, Mr. Gorbachev did not &quot;incite the Lithuanians todeclare their independence from the U.S.S.R.&quot; -- they havesought independence for decades, including seven years offreedom fighting from 1945 to 1952.   Third, the Soviet Constitution, Article 17, states theright of any republic to withdraw from the U.S.S.R. throughdemocratic means, which is exactly what Lithuania did.   Last, but most important, Lithuania is, in fact, a luckycountry -- a very lucky country -- with a rich history; acolorful, peaceful culture; one of the oldest, most beautifullanguages in the world; and 3.7 million peace-loving, proud,industrious people who have survived much stress andpersecution.   Michael D. Pavilon   Chicago   ---   In regard to Mr. Kristol's article:   1. Although &quot;no nation has ever recognized a right ofsecession,&quot; since when has the U.S. or any otherfreedom-loving country recognized a &quot;right of forcedbelonging&quot;? Remember -- the Baltics were invaded and forciblyabsorbed into the Soviet Union.   2. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are not part of the&quot;centuries-old Russian empire.&quot; Only for the past 50 yearshave they been forced to be part of the U.S.S.R.   3. Lithuania is not a &quot;lucky&quot; country because insensitive,uncaring and so-called rationalizing intelligentsia such asMr. Kristol will not give it support.   Anthony J.
