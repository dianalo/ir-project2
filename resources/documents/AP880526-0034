ManuelAntonio Noriega.   Indeed, the breakdown of negotiations with the United States toease the de facto leader out of power was partially attributed inPanama to the threat that such a deal could pose to treaties givingPanama control of the canal.   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz on Wednesday announced inWashington the collapse of talks and said no further negotiationsare planned.   Panama and the United States have been linked since this isthmusachieved independence in 1903. In fact, it was U.S. backing thatsecured Panama's break from Colombia and its declaring itself asovereign nation.   The United States recognized the new nation immediately andbegan an association that led to the construction of the PanamaCanal, the creation of the Canal Zone and the establishment ofmilitary bases.   Recovery of the Canal Zone, the area around the waterway, and ofthe canal itself have long been a Panamanian goal.   Panamanians still quote Noriega's predecessor, the late Gen.Omar Torrijos, who negotiated the 1977 canal treaties withthen-President Jimmy Carter.   Torrijos, who died in a 1981 plane crash and is a national idol,once said: ``I do not want to enter history, I want to enter theCanal Zone.''   Washington's antipathy for Noriega began in 1987 after years ofovert and tacit support for the man who, like Torrijos, heads the15,000-strong Panamanian Defense Forces and is the power behind thecivilian government.   Noriega and his supporters say the reasons for that change arePanamanians' unwillingness to bend to the giant of the north,Noriega's inclination to make friends on the left, and what wasperceived as his presidential ambitions.   Noriega also says Washington wants him out because he opposescontinued American military presence in Panama beyond Dec. 31,1999, when the canal reverts to Panamanian control.   It is believed in Panama that the Reagan administration'sfailure to oust Noriega stems from its inability to realize thesupport he enjoys among the military and the working class, as wellthe United States' ill-founded confidence that the politicalopposition could muster the necessary momentum.   The resiliency of Panamanians to face economic hardships broughton by tough U.S. sanctions also was unexpected.   Washington has imposed increasingly severe economic sanctionssince Noriega was indicted in Florida in February on federaldrug-trafficking charges.   But even opposition politicians say America's sudden dislike forNoriega responds ``more to U.S. strategic interests than to concernfor the people of Panama,'' as Christian Democratic leader RicardoArias Calderon put it.   Many Panamanians have little use for Noriega or the DefenseForces, a military and police organization that controls nearlyevery aspect of life in Panama. Yet there is deep-seated suspicionthat the United States is unwilling to cede, just 11 years fromnow, its extensive military installations.   The U.S. Southern Command, established to defend the canal, hasevolved into an intelligence gathering center and coordinator ofU.S. military activities for all of Latin America.   Already, the United States has given up the Canal Zone, a bit ofsuburban America with manicured lawns and neatly painted houses,and transferred partial control of the canal to Panama.   Then the United States created the Panama Canal Commission, madeup of five Americans and four Panamanians, to administer thewaterway that links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.   Ten-thousand U.S. military personnel are now stationed at 10facilities.   ``The United States aims to sustain and improve this system ofmilitary installations beyond the year 2000 ... to establish a muchlarger force in Panama,'' said Maj. Daniel Delgado Diamante,executive director for Panama for Canal Treaty Affairs.   According to a military source in Panama, the Defense Forcesconsiders the Southern Command ``a watchtower for the United Statesand a center of espionage. The information it provided the Englishduring the Falklands War was vital for them.''   The possibility of renegotiating the U.S. military presence wasone of the Panamanian concessions in the canal treaties.   Most important among the concessions was that the United States,in accordance with its constitutional procedures, ``will alwayshave the right to take action to defend the canal and maintain itsneutrality.''   Some Panamanians say this amounts to giving the United Statesthe permanent right to intervene in Panama.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Eloy O.
