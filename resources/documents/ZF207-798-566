(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>This is the last of a series on IBM's recently announced Repository, asignificant component of its applications-development strategy for the 1990s.andM;The adoption of a standard repository for design information is vital to asuccessful strategy for computer-aided software engineering (CASE) for bothend users and vendors.andP;  In accepting a repository standard, users ofcompliant CASE tools will be able to share design specifications, while CASEvendors will be allowed to compete in an open environment.andP;  It's that simple.andM;The introduction of the Application Development (AD)/Cycle by IBM clarifiesmany of the issues in defining a strategy for CASE.andP;  Third-party vendors ofCASE tools now can decide whether or not to adopt the de facto standard fordesign specifications defined by IBM.andP;  Users of CASE tools also can decidewhether to limit their purchase of CASE tools to those compliant with thepublished standard.andP;  Still, there are other issues relevant to theimplementation of a successful CASE strategy.andP;  These include support of topmanagement, selection of highly integrated CASE tools, use of a methodologyoptimized for high-speed development, and issues related to the training,education and motivation of the development staff.andM;A chief objective of a CASE strategy is a substantial boost in theproductivity of the applications-development process.andP;  As shown in thefigure, a large improvement in productivity depends on four factors (depictedas four tall pyramids): tools, methodology, personnel and management.andO;Correct judgments in all of these areas must be made to be successful inCASE.andP;  The management issues and the people issues are especially critical.andO;There are many examples of CASE strategies that have failed due to a lack ofattention to these issues in making the transition to a new developmentenvironment.andM;The announcement of the IBM Repository provides information-systems (IS)executives with an opportunity to review their overall CASE strategy.andP;  It isimportant for them to gain a broad perspective on the entire subject of CASE,because three years from now, the IBM Repository and the AD/Cycleapplications-development environment will be widely used.andP;  Planning now forthe introduction of these new architectures and development techniques willreduce costs and increase the effectiveness of implementing them.andM;Organizations planning for CASE should use diagramming techniques, such asentity-relationship diagrams, as well as data-modeling and process-modelingtechniques.andP;  Above all, they should plan to use the most powerful developmentmethodologies available, such as information engineering, to build thestrategic applications of the 1990s.andP;  Information engineering is amethodology that was specifically designed to support the development of thecomplex, mission-critical applications required for the computerized companyof the future.andM;Managers need to learn how to implement new business thrusts faster thantheir competition through the use of high-end, integrated CASE tools andmethodologies that are optimized for high-speed development.andP;  A large part ofthe success of high-speed development depends on building an infrastructure.andO;It is possible to develop applications on a project-by-project basis with noinfrastructure at all, but development will be much faster if resources aredevoted to building an infrastructure that promotes a high level ofportability, connectivity and reusability.andM;To achieve fast development, the methodology must resemble a finely tunedclock, in which all the gears mesh perfectly.andP;  If any of the gears do notmesh, development will not proceed at a rapid pace.andM;An important aspect of a strategy for CASE is selection of the right manager.andO;The manager can be described as the vice president of CASE -- someone whoclearly understands the critical success factors of the organization and canarticulate a strategy for CASE.andP;  The manager must understand the fastapplication life cycle and reusability, and be able to select CASE tools thatmeet the evolving needs of the organization.andM;It is important to select tools that are highly integrated and that supportthe IBM Repository standard.andP;  Unfortunately, the IBM Repository is notavailable; even in June 1990, it will still be a fragment of what isavailable now in the repositories of highly integrated CASE tools fromthird-party vendors.andP;  The repositories in these tools are being rapidlybrought into compliance with IBM's Repository.andM;Some of them are also supported by very detailed methodologies, such as theInformation Engineering Methodology from James Martin Associates.andM;Productivity improvements of two to three times over conventional techniquesare quite achievable with high-end, integrated CASE tools, including theeffort devoted to extensive front-end design activities.andP;  Such improvementsdo not require sophisticated development methodologies.andM;There are many examples of corporations that have improved productivity by afactor of 10, and many of these do not use methodologies such as informationengineering; rather, they were the result of single project development.andP;  Itis much easier to demonstrate results quickly with single project developmentthan it is with information engineering, because information engineeringrequires approximately two to three years to build the infrastructure.andO;However, once it is in place, it is possible to build applications fastconsistently.andM;To effectively monitor productivity, it must be consistently measured.andP;  Topmanagement should be informed that a metrics program is being put in placeand that measurements of productivity will be reported to them on a regularbasis.andP;  This may alarm some personnel because it gives the CEO a means ofmeasuring the success of the IS department.andP;  However, consistent measurementand reporting of productivity gains are a powerful way of attracting andretaining the interest of top management in a CASE strategy.andM;Some CASE vendors are beginning to provide metrics automatically frominformation stored in the repository, but much more needs to be done.andP;  As theanalyst creates design diagrams, the system can track the number of inputs,outputs, inquiries, files, interfaces and algorithms.andP;  These measurements canbe expressed in the form of function points, which are a measure of thecomplexity of the module.andP;  As the design progresses, the function-pointestimate is refined.andP;  Before entering the construction phase, a detailedfunction-point computation is made, which can be combined with otherproject-management information to provide productivity measurements.andP;  AllCASE vendors should provide these metrics automatically.andM;Choosing the Right VendorsandM;Another important step that organizations can take now to prepare for theintroduction of advanced applications-development environments such asAD/Cycle is to select CASE vendors who have committed to the commonRepository standard.andP;  As of last week, 32 CASE vendors have pledged supportfor IBM's AD/Cycle Repository.andM;In summary, the successful implementation of a CASE strategy relies on manyfactors.andP;  Primary among these is attracting the interest and support of topmanagement.andP;  Additional factors leading to success include selection of ahighly integrated CASE tool and a methodology that is optimized forhigh-speed development.andP;  Issues involving training, motivating and educatingthe development staff may be more important to the successful introduction ofCASE than technology issues.andP;  The management of cultural change within anorganization will be a major challenge for the computerized company of the1990s.andM;----------To learn more about the subject of these articles, please call The JamesMartin Report, an information service updated quarterly, at (800) 242-1240.andO;For information on seminars, please contact (in the United States and Canada)Technology Transfer Institute, 741 10th St., Santa Monica, Calif.andP;
