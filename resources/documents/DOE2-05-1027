As the result, instead of gaining in quantity, a variety of value-addedenergy services will be showing up which include new technologies ofenergy application and related new services. Aspect of energy and electricityapplication in the near future is briefly explained by industry, by privateenterprise, and by energy industry. In the development of applicationtechnology of electricity, developments have been on aiming at the creationof new services such as new power supply system for the supply of a varietyof power with variable reliability levels, load management for load leveling,information service, etc. Study on the power storage system has alsobeen carried on. Compact apparatus with enhanced efficiency can be expectedby the use of superconduction. As to energy and electricity supply technology,summarized reports are made on new energy technlogies such as nuclearpower generation, coal application, fuel cell, etc. (2 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
