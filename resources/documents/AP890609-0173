The new acid-rain standards _ not quite as extensive as the 12million-ton cut sought by environmentalists but far more rigid thanindustry has wanted _ are expected to be a key component in aclean-air package Bush will unveil on Monday.   The sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also saidthat Bush's package likely would give industries that use clean-coaltechnology additional time and flexibility in meeting the standards.   The legislation will not mandate how industrial plants should goabout reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, giving them the choice ofmethods, the sources said.   And the package will offer special credits and other financialincentives to industries that surpass the standards, the sourcessaid.   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush hadmade some ``preliminary decisions'' on the clean-air package, butwould make up his mind on some of the thornier issues this weekendwhile at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md.   ``He is taking with him decision memos and options on all themajor questions that are still outstanding, and we would expectdecisions over the weekend,'' Fitzwater said.   It was unclear Friday on how the cuts would be distributednationwide, but the president was expected to include a proposalwhere a utility excceeding the required reductions could sellcredits to one that had not, permitting the buying to utility tocomply.   Several sources said the president was provided options thatranged from forcing the 20 dirtiest plants to come up with most ofthe early emission reductions to forcing smaller cuts on 107 plantsacross the country.   The president is expected to propose a system by which a utilitythat exceeds the reduction requirements may sell credits to anotherthat has not, bringing the buying utility into compliance.   American Electric Power, which operates in parts of Ohio,Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and West Virginia, said Friday if the20-plant option is adopted, it would be forced to raise residentialelectric rates to to its customers from 15 to 25 percent.   ``The cost of such emission reductions will grind the economiesof the Midwestern states. Our heavy industries which rely upon lowenergy costs ... would be devastated,'' maintained A. Joseph Dowd,senior vice president. of American Electric Power.   Among the decisions still to be resolved, presumably, are whetherBush's package _ billed in advance as the most comprehensiveoverhaul yet of the 19-year-old Clean Air Act _ will set newstandards for automobile tailpipe exhausts.   Environmentalists want a requirement that tailpipe emissions ofhydrocarbons and nitrogen dioxide _ which were last reduced in 1981_ be further reduced by 1993. The automobile industry has voicedstrong objections to any further tightening of the standards.   Administration officials, perhaps signaling a decision againsttighter tailpipe standards, have stressed in recent days that theBush package would put heavy emphasis on alternate auto fuels _ suchas alcohol blends _ that contain fewer contaminants.   The president also is considering a reduction in nitrogen oxideemissions, another component of acid rain which primarily comes fromboth electric utility plants and automobiles. Options prepared bythe Domestic Policy Council suggested that annual nitrogen oxideemissions be cut by 2 million to 4 million tons, roughly 10 percentto 20 percent.   Nitrogen oxidens are transformed into nitric acid in theatmosphere, a minority component in acid rain in the East butnonetheless suspected by many scientists of helping damaqehigh-altitude forests through over-fertilization.   The president is expected to promote the alternate fuels sectionof his bill on Tuesday in a speech at the University of Nebraska inLincoln. It's the second day of a two-day Western trip to showcasethe new package.   He visits Yellowstone National Park on Monday, and gives a talkon the clean-air package Tuesday morning at the Teton Science Schoolat Jackson Hole, Wyo.   The clean-air bill, which Bush on Thursday declared would benefitthe quality of life of every North American, will have threesections _ dealing with acid rain, urban smog and chemical pollution.   Sources have said that the section on chemical pollution wouldset tough new requirements that would affect hundreds of categoriesof businesses, from paint plants to bakeries.   Cutting sulfur dioxide in the air by 10 million tons by the year2000, as Bush was expected to recommend, would reduce thecontaminant to roughly half its current level.   Acid rain is formed when sulfur dioxide, an ingredient ofsmokestack emissions from coal-burning utilities and industries,combines with water in the atmosphere and clouds to form acid whichthen returns to Earth in rain and snow.   Midwestern utilities that burn high-sulfur coal without cleanuptechnology are generally agreed to be the chief source of the acidrain that damages sensitive lakes, streams and aquatic life inCanada and the Northeast.   Bush, in his 1989 budget document to Congress, said hisadministration was ``committed to ending the long debate on acidrain.''   The president also agreed previously to a $5 billion, five-yearjoint study with Canada on finding ways to develop cleaner-burningcoal.</TEXT></DOC>
