The Wisconsin Democrat completed a draft of the bill to be considered at a committee meeting next Tuesday, the staffers said. Backers of the bill said it is expected to win support of at least 11 senators on the 20-member panel. But to be enacted this year, its critics said, the bill will have to ward off &quot;killer&quot; amendments from the insurance industry and emerge from the committee with more than a slim majority.    The stage is set for Tuesday's meeting to be the first major test of congressional support for rolling back the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separates the banking and securities industries. The meeting has been repeatedly delayed in recent weeks as interest groups and committee members have negotiated and floated competing proposals to amend the bill.    Sen. Proxmire and his committee's ranking Republican, Utah Sen. Jake Garn, gave Glass-Steagall overhaul new momentum last fall when they proposed letting banks underwrite securities through subsidiaries of their holding companies. But that failed to win strong backing within the committee.    The new bill also relies heavily for support on Sen. Garn and other Republicans. It would delay until Jan. 1, 1990, banks' authority to underwrite corporate equities. And it would hold off until Jan. 1, 1989, the power to underwrite corporate-debt securities with maturities longer than one year. The bill would let banks immediately underwrite other securities, including mortgage-backed securities, municipal-revenue bonds, commercial paper and mutual funds.    The measure also would allow certain diversified financial-services companies to operate banks, so long as bank assets don't exceed 20% of the company's consolidated assets. The previous Proxmire-Garn bill would have left this option open only to securities firms with few other businesses.    Backers of the new bill said it is intended to enable Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and American Express Co. to free their limited-service banks from the 7% annual growth cap imposed by last year's banking bill. But they said it wouldn't allow commercial companies, such as Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. and General Motors Corp., to expand their banking activities.    Major bank lobbyists endorsed the draft bill, but it faces an uphill battle. Its backers expect efforts by insurance groups to foreclose all insurance activities by banks, which could kill the bill. Securities firms and their supporters, meanwhile, will try to trim its scope. Its path is likely to be even more difficult in the House than in the Senate, and time for action is short. </TEXT></DOC>
