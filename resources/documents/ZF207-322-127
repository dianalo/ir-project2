 Pacer Software's PacerLink brings full VT100 and VT220 terminalemulation to the Macintosh.andP;  And with the help of PacerLink's sister package,PacerGraph, you can also use the Mac as a VT240 graphics terminal.andM;PacerLink provides a standard Mac user interface, complete with pull-downmenus, icons, dialog boxes and windows.andP;  Yet despite PacerLink's allegianceto the Mac's &quot;look and feel,&quot; it provides excellent VT terminal emulationsthat are sure to please VAX users.andM;DR Labs tested version 5.0 of PacerLink.andP;  We established the Mac-to-VAXconnection using a Kinetics EtherPort card, which allows a Mac to access anEthernet network directly.andM;The PacerLink software must be installed on the Macintosh.andP;  If users areconnecting a Mac to a VAX through an Ethernet or AppleTalk data path,additional PacerLink software needs to be installed on the VAX host.andP;  Thishost software is not necessary if the MAC is being connected to the VAXdirectly through an asynchronous data path.andM;Because we were connecting the Mac to a MicroVAX II over Ethernet, we neededto install Pacer software on the MicroVAX, which we accomplished using thestandard VMSINSTAL command procedure.andM;Installing the PacerLink software on the Mac was just as simple.andP;  We copiedthe appropriate files from the distribution diskette to the Mac's hard disk.andO;Because we were using the AppleTalk protocol to connect with the VAX, we alsohad to copy the supplied driver file, ATdriver, to the Mac's system folder.andM;Starting up PacerLink is fairly straightforward.andP;  The software provides astandard configuration file for connecting to a VAX.andP;  Users can modify thisVAX configuration file or create and save their own configuration files.andO;These configuration files appear on the Mac Desktop with their own icon.andM;We started PacerLink by double-clicking on the icon representing thePacer-supplied VAX configuration file.andP;  (Alternatively, we could havedouble-clicked on the icon of a configuration file we created for ourselves.)andO;Once PacerLink was running, we pulled down the Config menu, chose EditCommunication Settings (Fig.andP;  1) and selected AppleTalk from the list ofavailable communications protcols.andP;  Once this was done we were ready to login to our MicroVAX.andM;Users communicate with the host VAX via windows on their Macintosh.andO;PacerLink provides a general-purpose window, a display window and a SoftKeywindow.andP;  Although many windows can be on the screen at once, only one can beactive at a time.andM;The general-purpose window is a standard Mac window that communicates withthe VAX host.andP;  Like other Mac windows, it can be opened, closed, moved,resized and scrolled.andP;  With PacerLink, users can establish multipleconnections to a single host or multiple connections to multiple hosts.andP;  Eachconnection is represented by its own window.andP;  All general-purpose windows arevisible on the Mac screen.andM;The display window is used to display Mac text files (Fig.andP;  2).andP;  Users canload text files into the display window using the File menu.andP;  The displaywindow is helpful for holding information that is to be copied to anotherwindow.andP;  Like the general-purpose window, the display window can be scrolled,moved and re-sized.andM;The SoftKey window can be moved or hidden.andP;  Within this window are 20 &quot;soft&quot;function keys that users employ to invoke commands on the VAX.andM;PacerLink supplies predefined Softkeys, but users can create their owncustomized SoftKey definitions via the Edit Softkeys option under PacerLink'sSpecial menu.andP;  (Fig.andP;  3)andM;Each SoftKey has a descriptive label that identifies a VMS command, such asMAIL or DIRECTORY.andP;  SoftKeys that invoke VMS utilities or programs, such asEDT and VMS Mail, can in turn load a second set of SoftKeys that can be usedto invoke utility-specific commands.andM;SoftKey definitions can be saved as files on the Mac and then retrieved forfuture use.andM;PacerLink also makes use of the Mac's Clipboard window, which is used to holdtext being moved to or from other windows via the Cut, Copy and Paste optionsunder the Edit menu.andM;Users can manipulate all of these windows by clicking and dragging them withthe mouse or by selecting some of the options under PacerLink's Window menu.andO;The Miniwindows option shrinks all of the general-purpose display windowscurrently on the screen.andP;  The contents of these windows remain displayed butthe text is reduced to half its normal size.andM;PacerLink's Window menu also has a Stack Windows option, which stacksgeneral-purpose display windows in a pile, and a Tile Windows, which arrangesall the windows neatly across the Mac screen (Fig.andP;  4).andP;  Smaller Mac monitorsthat cannot fit two full-sized windows side by side, such as the MacintoshSE, do not support PacerLink's tiling function.andM;Users can set and modify terminal setup characteristics using the choices inPacerLink's Config menu.andP;  Within this menu, users can specify the terminaltype, terminal settings (such as keyboard settings), and the communicationsprotocol--asynchronous, AppleTalk or TCP/IP.andM;In addition, users can modify display characteristics by choosing thePreferences option from the Config menu.andP;  This option presents a dialog boxwithin which users can set various terminal display characteristics,including foreground color for bold text and background color forreverse-video text.andP;  Users can modify these settings and save them incustomized configuration files that can be re-used.andM;PacerLink's usefulness extends beyond terminal emulation.andP;  The software alsolets users transfer and print files across a network.andM;Its Transfer menu includes options for sending files to printers on the VAXhost.andP;  PacerLink lets users print Macintosh files either on a Macintoshprinter or on a VAX printer.andP;  For printing files on a VAX printer usingPacerLink, users specify VMS printing parameters for their print jobs via aSpool Options Form.andP;  Similarly, users can print files on the VAX host oneither a VAX printer or on a Macintosh printer.andM;PacerLink also offers very good file transfer routines.andP;  Files can betransferred easily between the Mac and a VAX using three different protocols:ASCII (for plain text), binary (for binary files) and Macbinary (forMac-specific binary files).andM;The software has some additional features to facilitate file transfers.andP;  Forexample, a multiple-file transfer utility lets users send or receive morethan one file at a time.andP;  Also, if a file to be transferred has the same nameas one on the destination system, users can choose to have PacerLinkautomatically skip that transfer, overwrite the existing file on thedestination machine, or assign a unique name (the original file name plus anadditional character) to the transferred file.andM;PacerLink also has a Send Text File option under the Transfer menu that letsusers send data from a Mac text file directly to the host, where it can beacted upon immediately.andP;  Thus, if the VAX host is at the DCL level, thetransferred text is interpreted as DCL commands.andM;Sophisticated users may wish to take advantage of some of PacerLink's specialfeatures.andP;  Users can create command scripts that store a series of PacerLinkcommands--functions similar to those listed under PacerLink's pull-downmenus.andM;Users can create command scripts by writing the commands directly to a fileor by having PacerLink record the commands a user enters as it is executingthem.andP;  Once the recording is turned off, the stored commands are saved in afile for future use.andM;DATA LOGandM;Another useful feature is PacerLink's logging option, which lets users recordthe data being exchanged between the Mac and the VAX.andP;  Users can choose torecord just the data being sent from the VAX to the Mac or the data beingsent from the Mac to the VAX.andP;  This recorded data can be saved in a new fileor appended to an existing file.andM;Only PacerLink's VAX host software is licensed.andP;  This allows unrestricteddistribution of the Mac software, with the exception of PacerGraph, whichlets the Mac emulate a VT240 graphics terminal.andP;  Prices for PacerLink arebased on the number of concurrent sessions that the host software willsupport.andP;  (See &quot;Prices,&quot; page XX.)andM;Pacer Software offers several other Mac-VAX connectivity products besidesPacerLink.andP;  PacerShare lets a VAX serve as an AppleShare file server, andPacerPrint provides transparent spooling of print jobs to Apple Laser-Writerand other PostScript printers attached to a VAX or a VAX network.andM;PacerLink's emulation of a VT220 is very good.andP;  One of its few shortcomingsis that it does not support the true VT220's downloadable character sets.andO;Pacer Software plans to add this feature in a future release of PacerLink.andM;In general, the software performs well.andP;  It complements its thoroughemulation of standard VT220 terminal functions with easy-to-use menus andwindowed displays.andP;  All in all, PacerLink is a polished product that deliverson its promise.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
