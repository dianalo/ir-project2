Danish activist Klaus Iversen of Greenpeace carried out theprotest late Thursday from the group's vessel Moby Dick, which wasin international waters near the Soviet coast, said Greenpeace andthe Swedish news agency TT.   The Moby Dick was near Riga to watch NATO sea maneuvers called``Baltops 89'' when the protester placed a 3-by-5 foot yellowwarning flag with a black international symbol for radioactivityinto a hole of the missile launcher.   The Soviet crew watched without intervening until Iversen and twofellow activists in a dingy beside the sub left. Then a Sovietcrewman immediately took down the flag, which has three trianglesmeeting in the middle.   The nuclear-powered submarine carries four tubes for cruisenuclear-tipped missiles.   Greenpeace spokesman Magnus Furugard said the Soviet crew warilywatched the dinghies with binoculars.   After the activists stopped next to the submarine, they waited``to see how they reacted aboard,'' the spokesman said. ``As it iswar ships we are dealing with, we are very careful.''   The crew ``appeared mainly curious,'' said Furugard.   ``The crew did not intervene until after our activist was on hisway down from the sub and a sailor ran out to pull the banneraway,'' Furugard said.   At least 15 NATO vessels were taking part in the naval exercise,including the U.S. battleship Iowa and cruiser Ticonderoga, bothcarrying nuclear weapons, according to Greenpeace.   Ticonderoga is scheduled to visit Stockholm next week, and aGreenpeace spokesman said the group will try to prevent its arrival.   ``We hope the Swedish government will come to its senses,'' saidspokesman Jakob Lagercrantz said. He gave no details on theGreenpeace plan.   The government officially refuses to allow ships with nuclearweapons in its waters, but it does not question visitors who declineto say if such arms are on board.</TEXT></DOC>
