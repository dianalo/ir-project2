Theagency concludes that the proposed use of methylglutarimide/acrylic copolymersis safe, and that a new regulation, andSection; 177.1060 <T3>n</T3>-Alkylglutarimide/acrylic copolymers, should be added to 21 CFRPart 177 to authorize the use of the additive. The permitted uses of <T3>n-</T3>methylglutarimide/acrylic copolymers are listed in this regulation.As part of its review of the petition, FDA considered the potential environmentalimpact from increased usage of vinyl chloride homo- and copolymers resultingfrom the use of <T3>n</T3>-methylglutarimide/acrylic copolymer as a polymer modifier. FDAinitially concluded that there could be a significant increase in the useof vinyl chloride homo- and copolymers to package food from this use. (Ina separate action, the agency has decided to prepare an environmental impactstatement to assess the environmental impact of significant increases inuse of vinly chloride polymers (November 22, 1988; 53 FR 47264).) Therefore,FDA is establishing a limit in the regulation to preclude use of the additivewith vinyl chloride homo- and copolymers, pending further resolution ofthe environmental impact issues.In accordance with andSection; 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition andthe documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decisionto approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center forFood Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contactperson listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will deletefrom the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosurebefore making the documents available for inspection.The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effectsof this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significantimpact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statementis not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and theevidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment,may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at anytime on or before June 12, 1989 file with the Dockets Management Branch(address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separatelynumbered, and each numbered objection shall specify with particularitythe provisions of the regulation to which objection is made and the groundsfor the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requestedshall specifically so state. Failure to request a hearing for any paticularobjection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing on that objection.Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall includea detailed description and analysis of the specific factual informationintended to be presented in support of the objection in the event thata hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis forany particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearingon the objection.
