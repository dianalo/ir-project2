In eastern France, police went to a Peugeot auto plant in casethey were ordered to expel militants, and the government appointeda labor expert to mediate the strike.   Unions representing nurses, police officers, firefighters andpublic transport workers have either threatened walkouts or stagedshort work stoppages this week.   Rocard, a Socialist, told the National Assembly on Wednesdaythat the disputes were ``worrisome, very worrisome in somerespects, (but) far from being catastrophic.''   The Justice Ministry said most of the 15,000 prison guards whostruck Sept. 27 had heeded a union leader's call to return to work.   Jacques Vialottes, head of one of the four unions representingthe guards, declared the walkout a failure since the government hadrefused steadfastly to negotiate higher overtime pay.   The government had sent in riot police to assure no prisonersescaped and to break up crowds of strikers blocking gates atseveral prisons.   ``I no longer want to send my boys into a danger zone,''Vialottes said. ``We will find another solution.''   About 30,000 civil servants from the Finance Ministry marchedthrough central Paris to Rocard's office to press their demands forhigher pay and better working conditions.   Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said he will meet with unionleaders Friday to address their demands.   The strike began in June when tax collectors walked out. Theirunion says uncollected taxes have cost the government at least $5.5billion in sales taxes alone.   Striking Peugeot metalworkers welcomed the appointment of laborexpert Francis Blanchard, who will try to resolve the impassebetween the workers and company President Jacques Calvet.   Calvet has refused to negotiate with strikers at factories inMulhouse and Sochaux as long as they disrupt production.   Peugeot called on police Thursday to uphold a court order thatseveral hundred strikers in Mulhouse vacate a forge they hadoccupied for about a week.   Calvet says Peugeot cannot afford a pay raise of more than 3.8percent this year if the company is to modernize its plants andcompete with Japanese automakers.   But this argument lost some credibility among workers afterFrench newspapers reported that in 1988 Calvet received a raise of46 percent over two years for a salary of about $335,000.</TEXT></DOC>
