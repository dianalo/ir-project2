(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Indian activist pleaded guiltyWednesday to 14 kidnap charges stemming from the armed seizure of anewsroom in 1988 and was sentenced to 18 years in prison.   Eddie Hatcher, 32, and fellow Tuscarora tribesman Timothy Jacobshad claimed they were trying to draw attention to local lawenforcement's alleged involvement in drug dealing when they held upto 20 people hostage at The Robesonian newspaper on Feb. 1, 1988.   The pair, armed with shotguns, surrendered to the FBI after 10hours.   After Hatcher and Jacobs were tried and acquitted on federalkidnapping charges, a Robeson County grand jury indicted them onstate charges. Jacobs pleaded guilty to kidnapping charges lastyear and received a six-year sentence.   Hatcher made no statement during Wednesday's court appearance.He answered only ``yes'' or ``no'' as Superior Court Judge CoyBrewer Jr. asked him about the plea bargain.   The hearing contrasted with Hatcher's last appearance, when hethrew pens at a judge and called him a ``racist.''   Defense attorney Barry Nakell said Hatcher, who faced a maximumsentence of 420 years on the charges, had decided on his own toseek the plea bargain. Nakell said the newspaper seizure had led tosome ``small measures of progress, but not the throughinvestigation the situation deserves.''   District Attorney Richard Townsend said Hatcher and hisattorneys had created a ``media circus'' with their charges, butnone of them had been valid.   ``There have been attempts to influence what happens in thiscourtroom by making accusations, and the wilder the better,''Townsend said. ``But the only accusations that have been found tohave any merit are the 14 charges of kidnapping in this case.''   Townsend said Hatcher's flight from Robeson County to seekasylum at two Indian reservations and the Soviet consulate in SanFrancisco, combined with his charges of official corruption,``sounds like a plotline from `Dallas' with `Meet the Press' thrownin, and a dash of `Miami Vice.'''   Townsend said the newspaper hostages had agreed to the pleabargain.   ``It certainly was acceptable to me,'' said Lee Hamilton, one ofThe Robesonian reporters held. ``I definitely thought he (Hatcher)would drag it out as long as he could and get all the attention hecould.''</TEXT></DOC>
