Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   The dollar rallied yesterday, and traders cited an expected sell-off by Japanese institutions that failed to materialize plus anticipation of dollar-buying related to Bridgestone Corp.'s planned takeover of Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber Co.    The dollar climbed 0.9% to stand at 125.25 yen in late New York trading yesterday, compared with 124.15 late Monday. The U.S. currency also gained 1.1% to 1.6702 marks from 1.6522.    In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was trading at about 125.05 yen, down from 125.23 yen at the opening.    Meanwhile, the pound resumed its rise against other major European currencies, prompting central bank intervention to slow its move. Traders said the U.S. Federal Reserve intervened in New York trading to sell sterling, presumably on behalf of the Bank of England. Despite the reported selling, the pound climbed 0.6% to 3.1375 marks from 3.1202.    Traders also said the Bank of Canada intervened to support the Canadian dollar, which sagged as investors took profits on the recent rise of the Canadian dollar and bond market. Traders speculated that the Bank of Canada's move was intended to thwart the development of a speculative run against the currency.    The Canadian dollar fell to 80.51 U.S. cents yesterday, down 0.4% from 80.83 U.S. cents late Monday and down 0.6% since the beginning of Monday trading.    Fear, rather than optimism, sparked the rush into the U.S. currency yesterday, traders said. Many market participants had established short, or oversold, dollar positions in the expectation that Japanese institutional investors would become big sellers of dollars after the new Japanese fiscal year began Friday.    &quot;When the selling didn't surface, traders had to cover short positions, and that started the rally,&quot; Charles A. Spence, vice president, foreign exchange, at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said.    Traders grew more skittish about holding short dollar positions after the U.S. government's approval this week of Bridgestone's proposed acquisition of Firestone. Dealers said Bridgestone, a Japanese tire maker, probably will need to enter the foreign exchange market soon to acquire the $2.6 billion in U.S. currency it would need to cover the acquisition price.    &quot;With the dollar in a (long-term) declining mode, I can't imagine a Japanese company with that much (U.S. currency) in their hopper,&quot; Mr. Spence said.    Although the pound fell to $1.8785 yesterday from $1.8885, it rallied against other major currencies as international investors continued to be drawn by Britain's relatively high interest rates. Three-month Eurocurrency deposit rates for sterling stood at 8 5/8% yesterday, compared with the 3 3/8% yields offered by similar investments denominated in marks.    The central bank action against sterling did little to dull traders' appetite for the pound.    &quot;Whichever way you look at it, sterling has just one way to go, and that's up, simply because of high interest rates,&quot; Albert Soria, vice president and foreign exchange manager for Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $3.30 an ounce to $453.40 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 2.7 million ounces.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Tuesday, April 5, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
