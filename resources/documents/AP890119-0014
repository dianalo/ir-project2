The studies also show that many lightning rods and protectivedevices are inadequate to handle the rapid surge of electricalcurrent when a lightning bolt strikes, said E. Philip Krider of theUniversity of Arizona in Tucson.   ``You need to have a protective system that is much faster thanwe thought even 10 years ago,'' Krider said Wednesday at the annualmeeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.   Krider and his colleagues have for the first time been able totrigger, direct and study lightning bolts in electrified clouds.   Those studies have shown that current in a lightning bolt cansurge 400,000 amps in a millionth of a second, about 20 times fasterthan researchers had thought possible, Krider said.   ``Most distribution arrestors _ the kind you put on power lines _are probably not fast enough'' to protect the lines from lightningdamage, he said.   Many lightning rods, likewise, cannot carry current to the groundquickly enough, so there is a danger that the current will sparkwildly in dfferent directions from the tip of the lightning rod.   Krider and his colleagues trigger lightning bolts by launchinginto electrified clouds a three-foot-long rocket trailing a wireconnected to the ground.   The rocket disturbs the electrical charges in the cloud, beginsto spark at its tip and then triggers a lightning bolt down the wireto the ground.   The researchers have learned that about three-quarters of thespacecraft that have been hit by lightning have triggered thelightning bolts themselves by a similar process.   A large fraction of thick, layered clouds are electrified andcould provide the right environment for commercial aircraft and evensmall private planes to trigger lightning bolts, Krider said.   ``The triggered lightning hazard was previously unsuspected,because the cloud was not making any lightning,'' he said.   Researchers do not yet know how to identify clouds that providethe environment for this triggered lightning, Krider said.   ``If we understood what kinds of clouds have this potential, wemight be able to say `avoid this situation,''' he said.   Lightning can pose a serious hazard to aircraft by disturbingtheir electrical systems or blowing out their engines, Krider said.   Krider is part of a team of scientists studying how to reduce thechances that lightning bolts will strike and damage the spaceshuttle.   They are trying to devise a way to monitor the electrification ofthe clouds so launches can be postponed when conditions are ripe forthe shuttle to trigger lightning bolts.   The researchers also are trying to devise ways to make theshuttle more resistant to lightning damage if it is struck, he said.   One of the problems underlying the research, he said, is thatphysicists don't understand how electricity builds up in clouds.</TEXT></DOC>
