The law, which also is intended to extend health benefits to``domestic partners'' of city workers, was opposed by the RomanCatholic Church but hailed by homosexual couples, who cannotlegally marry, and heterosexuals lovers who don't want to wed.   The law, which passed on a 10-0 vote with one supervisor absent,requires a routine second vote May 30 before going to Mayor ArtAgnos, who has promised to sign it.   The supervisors also voted 10-0 to direct the mayor to form atask force to examine how health benefits could be extended todomestic partners of city employees.   A few other cities have adopted policies extending healthbenefits to live-in lovers of municipal employees. But SanFrancisco would be the first to allow any non-married couples inthe county to register their relationships like traditional couplesfile marriage licenses.   The ``Declaration of Domestic Partnership'' form would be filedwith the county clerk for a $35 fee.   ``I hope that other cities around the country ... will belooking at ways to change their laws to reflect the reality of theway people live,'' said Harry Britt, president of the Board ofSupervisors, author of the measure and a leader of the city'spolitically powerful gay community.   Britt played down worries by Agnos that people from other citiesmight swarm to San Francisco to get their relationshipslegitimized. He emphasized that the law's benefits would apply onlyto partners of city workers, but urged that its spirit be adoptedin all spheres.   ``My hope is that people will go to their unions, they'll go totheir employers, they'll go wherever in society people are givensome sort of benefits, and be able now to say, `This is the personI love' and be dealt with fairly,'' he said.   In addition to health benefits, live-in lovers of the 25,000city workers would be entitled to bereavement leave and hospitalvisitation rights.   ``This is long overdue,'' said Scott Smith, who was the lover ofHarvey Milk, San Francisco's first gay supervisor, who wasassassinated in 1978. ``Our relationships are just as valid asnon-gay relationships.''   The law, which defines domestic partners as any ``two people whohave chosen to share one another's lives in an intimate andcommitted relationship,'' is not binding on private businesses. Butproponents say the city's policy could lead to changes in manyareas.   ``This is only the beginning,'' said Matthew Coles, a lawyer whohelped draft the law and worked on similar measures adopted inBerkeley and Santa Cruz. West Hollywood also has such a law.   Private employers, though, remain skeptical.   ``My impression is that companies are not eager to stretchbenefits that far,'' said Richard Morten, vice president of the SanFrancisco Chamber of Commerce.   The Roman Catholic Church worked against a similar plan vetoedby then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein in 1982. The Rev. George Wesolek ofthe Archdiocese of San Francisco recently called the law ``afrontal assault on marriage and the family as we know it.''   Deacon Norman Phillips of the Archdiocese said he was notsurprised by the vote. ``I think our hope would be that they mightreconsider,'' he said.   The church is opposed to the ``pseudo-marriage'' provision ofthe legislation, although it supports the extension of civil rightsbenefits and health coverage, Phillips added.   Another clergyman said the law would have a positive impact onthe AIDS crisis.   ``We need to support gay couples in stable relationships, notpromiscuous sex,'' said Episcopal priest Robert Cromey.   Some of the city's employees worry their health-care premiumscould rise if the cost of insuring domestic partners, includingAIDS patients, drains city funds. Health and insurance officialssay the newly eligible people will pay their own way with monthlypremiums of about $150.   In Berkeley, 7.5 percent of the city's 1,450 employees havesought coverage for domestic partners under its health plan.Eighty-five percent of those couples are heterosexual.</TEXT></DOC>
