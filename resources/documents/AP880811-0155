An outright ban on the toys, among the topics of a Househearing, is opposed by toy manufacturers, whose products often areexact replicas of machine guns and assault rifles.   The $300 million-a-year industry supports a measure requiringthem to identify their harmless products with bright orangemarkings.   But ban supporters say that bits of tape or paint aren't enoughto assure police officers that they aren't staring down the barrelof a real threat.   The hearing by the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee onconsumer protection was chaired by Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., whoshowed what appeared to be an Israeli-made Uzi machine gun. ``Is itreal, or is it a toy?'' Florio asked the audience.   It was a water pistol. But Florio also showed an actual Uzi, andthe two were all but identical.   Florio and police experts showed several examples of actualfirearms and obvious toy knock-offs, including replicas of a MAC-10machine pistol and a .45-caliber pistol.   The hearing came four days after an incident in Woodbridge,N.J., in which a police officer was wounded trying to apprehend aman armed with a real-looking toy pistol.   Patrolman William McSweeney was wounded in the leg by anotherpoliceman's gun that discharged in a struggle with a suspect. Thesuspect's weapon turned out to be a replica of a .45 automatic.   Two bills are pending in Congress to regulate such``look-alike'' guns.   One, sponsored by Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., would require tneorange markings. The other, offered by Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif.,calls for an outright ban on any toy gun resembling a real weapon.   Levine said his legislation ``is meant to make child's playsafer than it is. It is not meant to ban all toy guns, just thosethat are highly realistic.''   Nationally syndicated television consumer advocate DavidHorowitz testified that New York City police last year confiscatedmore than 1,400 toy guns used in crimes.   Horowitz himself was held hostage during a live TV broadcastlast year by a man holding what later turned out to be a fake gun.   ``I could see the gun, and so could my colleagues on the set,and there was no doubt in any of our minds that it was the realthing,'' he said.   Horowitz said toy manufacturers refuse to stop sellinglook-alike guns, because they sell better than unrealistic plasticweapons.   Toy manufacturers supported Dole's bill, calling for the orangemarkings, but said the Levine measure was too harsh.   They said a ban on toy guns would cost jobs in the toy industry,although guns represent less than 1 percent of the overall dollarvalue of toy sales.</TEXT></DOC>
