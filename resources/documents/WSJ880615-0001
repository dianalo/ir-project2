As part of a major restructuring, Pirelli plans early next year to spin off its tire operations into a group that will be 70% owned by Pirelli S.p.A. The remaining 30% initially will be held by Societe Internationale Pirelli, the Swiss-based holding company that is the Milan concern's biggest shareholder, and eventually will be quoted on international stock exchanges.    After completing this month the purchase of Armstrong Tire Co., &quot;We have sufficient size to move forward,&quot; said Ludovico Grandi, general director of Pirelli's world-wide tire operations. &quot;But we think we still need to grow more, not only internally but through acquisitions.&quot;    Pirelli isn't in talks with any potential takeover candidates at the moment, but Mr. Grandi indicated the company was looking for ways to step up its presence in the Far East, where Pirelli currently gets less than 8% of its tire sales. He said this could be accomplished through technical agreements, accords with local producers or by taking an equity stake in a company. </TEXT></DOC>
