The prospect of higher rates also depressed shares in Frankfurt and Zurich. Singapore stocks strengthened, and markets elsewhere were mixed in generally slow trading.    Tokyo's Nikkei index was down 251.67 to 27662.12. The Tokyo Stock Exchange index fell 19.86, or 0.91%, to 2166.56.    In mid-morning trading in Tokyo Tuesday, share prices ended sharply lower. The Nikkei index stood at 27109.31, down 552.81 points.    To explain monday's decline, analysts cited action by the bank of japan, which shored up the yen against a rising u.s. dollar by allowing a rise in the one-month bill rate. Investors took this as a sign of higher interest rates to come, they said, and government bond prices declined, driving up yields.    Share trading slowed to about 1.1 billion shares from two billion Friday as the weak bond market drove down financial issues and eventually most other stocks. Exceptions included export-oriented electricals, which would tend to benefit from a stronger dollar. Hitachi rose 60 yen to 1780 yen ($13.31) a share, and Toshiba gained 30 to 1080. Fuji Electric was up 11 to 874, and Sanyo was 18 higher at 810. NEC, however, eased 20 to 2140.    Sumitomo Bank was down 120 yen to 3220, Fuji Bank fell 80 to 2980, and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank was off 90 at 2910. Nikko Securities fell 80 to 1880, while Yamaichi Securities was down 60 to 1800, and Nomura Securities was down 90 to 3650.    Among auto makers, Honda rose 60 to 1930 in heavy trading, but most others were little changed. Nippon Steel gained 10 to 754, but another steel issue, NKK, eased 5 to 715.    In London, stocks also sagged in light trading, as the Financial Times 100-share index fell 12.2 to 1849.3. The 30-share industrial index dropped 14.2 to 1483.3. Volume was 366.4 million shares, compared with 591.5 million Friday.    London stocks opened lower after the decline in Tokyo. The market rallied slightly after U.K. banks raised their base rates to 10.5% from 10%, reflecting market approval of a move to damp inflationary pressures. But shares drifted lower again in early afternoon.    &quot;The market doesn't feel (a one-half percentage point rise) is enough&quot; and expects an additional half-point rise soon, said Peter Meinertzhagen, head of sales at London stockbrokers Hoare Govett.    Reports that Iran appeared to accept a United Nations-backed cease-fire in its war with Iraq helped selected oil shares, traders said. Shell Transport andamp; Trading gained 12 pence to 1056 pence ($17.79) a share, British Petroleum gained 2 to 260, and Burmah Oil rose 6 to 545.    In corporate news, Wereldhave, a Dutch real estate investment group, launched a #265 million takeover bid for Peachey Property. Peachey's shares rose 12 to 620.    Amstrad, a computer and electronics manufacturer, rose 7 to 225 after news it reached an agreement with International Business Machines on access to patented technology.    In Sydney, an influx of foreign demand at the opening created a positive tone, brokers said. They also cited Friday's gains on the New York market and news that Australia's June current-account deficit was within market expectations. The deficit narrowed to 882 million Australian dollars (US$702.8 million) from A$1.30 billion in May.    The Sydney market's benchmark indicator, the All-Ordinaries index, rose 19.6, or 1.2%, to 1641.8, its highest close since the world-wide stock market crash last October.    Swollen by heavy demand for Bell Group, trading rose to 130 million shares from 112 million Friday. Rising stocks outpaced declining issues by more than 2-1.    West German shares slumped on the Frankfurt exchange in response to worries about higher interest rates, brokers said.    But they said the dollar's rise Friday to an 11-month high against the mark was a positive factor that bolsters earnings prospects for West German exporters.    Some of the heaviest losers were ratesensitive issues such as banks. Deutsche Bank was down 11 to 471.00 marks ($254.02) a share, Commerzbank dropped 1 to 231.50, and Dresdner Bank slumped 2.50 to 257.    Zurich shares were mixed in subdued trading, with the dollar's rise and interestrate worries making many players cautious.    Stocks in Milan rose in active trading spurred by foreign demand. Foreign brokerage firms apparently view Italian equities as undervalued at present compared with several other markets.    Shares were little changed in Brussels, Amsterdam, Madrid and Stockholm. In Johannesburg, South African gold stocks closed lower in quiet trading. Shares also closed lower in Hong Kong, Taipei and Seoul and higher in Manila, Sydney, Singapore and Wellington.    Singapore's rise came in heavy trading and was attributed to the report late last week that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit for May remained near the $10 billion level it reached in April, encouraging hopes that the gap will continue to shrink.
