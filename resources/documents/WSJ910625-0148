Klein</HL><DATE>06/25/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A20</SO><LP>   Indianapolis -- In the matter of row vs. wade, there wasvery little dispute here last week. Waders were few at EagleCreek Reservoir -- mostly small children -- while of rowersthere were many.   There were young rowers and almost middle-aged ones,lightweight ones and heavy ones, tall ones and, uh, more tallones. Some very fast ones, too, which was the point, becausethe Hoosier metropolis was host to the U.S. Rowing NationalChampionship Regatta.</LP><TEXT>   For four days beginning Thursday, sculls and shells pliedthe 2,000-meter Eagle Creek course, and most of thelawnchaired and picnic-blanketed spectators didn't need to bereminded that all sculls are shells but all shells aren'tsculls. That's because most had friends or relatives in thefield.   &quot;That's the kind of crowd we draw,&quot; said Alison Townley, aMinneapolis native continuing her quest for a berth on hersecond U.S. Olympic team. &quot;Anytime you wave to the shore, abunch of people you know wave back.&quot;   For all the chumminess, though, some real competition tookplace, as well as some real sweat, and the rowers weren't shyabout advertising it. &quot;Athletes Row/Others Play Games,&quot;proclaimed one bumper sticker in the meet's parking lot.&quot;Conditioning is what the sport's mostly about,&quot; confirmedMike Porterfield, a rangy Virginian who's a three-yearnational team member and winner of two gold medals here. &quot;Yougive it all you've got for the first 1,500 meters, then gutit out the rest of the way.&quot;   U.S. rowers came to this meet in better spirits than inmany past years, because their international fortunes havebeen looking up. Rowing has a long history on these shores:The first American collegiate athletic event was a 1852 racebetween crews from Harvard and Yale. But during the late1960s and '70s the U.S. was eclipsed by the Soviets and EastEuropeans, whose pick-'em-young-and-train-'em-hard methodswere well suited to an activity that offers 42 Olympic medalsin six women's and eight men's events.   So in 1980 the U.S. decided to join 'em, at least partway, by hiring Kris Korzeniowski, a Polish defector, as anational coach. He's now technical director for U.S. Rowing,and coach of the men's sweep teams. (In &quot;sweep&quot; rowing, eachathlete wields one oar; in sculling, each wields two.)   Under Korzeniowski's guidance, American eight-man teamswon medals in five consecutive world championships orOlympics from 1984 through 1988, including the gold at the1987 worlds in Copenhagen. This year, he's been joined on thestaff by Igor Grinko, a Soviet who's coaching the scullers,and Hartmut Buschbacher, a (formerly East) German who'stutoring the women sweepers.   What Korzeniowski did, in brief, was bring some unity toAmerican rowing in terms of technique and training regimen(&quot;For the first time in my experience, you could go into anyboathouse and see the U.S. program tacked to the wall,&quot; notes34-year-old Mike Teti, a national-team member since 1977).Korzeniowski also introduced some rationality into ateam-selection system that depended too much on the resultsof too few races.   Korzeniowski says the latter process still needsimproving. &quot;Our system is very American -- open, `fair' anddemocratic -- but it's still not the best,&quot; he says, smilingslightly. Further, he wishes that more financial support wereavailable for postgraduates in a sport where equipment isexpensive and prize money nonexistent. But he believesrowing's strengths in this country can make up for itsshortcomings.   &quot;We can't recruit our athletes as young as some countries,or train them as hard over long periods. But we give awaynothing in terms of individual motivation or intelligence,&quot;he says. &quot;When someone tells me I have a lot of intelligentathletes, I correct them. I say every one of them is smart.&quot;   Indeed, short of a Mensa convention, it would be difficultto corral as brainy a bunch as hauled oar in Indianapolis,thanks partly to the sport's Northeastern collegiate roots.The above-mentioned Townley, a bronze medalist at the 1990worlds, is a Harvard anthropology graduate, and Kris Karlson,her partner in winning the double sculls here, is a Williamsgrad who's a physician. National-team sweeper Jeff McLaughlin(Northeastern, '89) is an architect. Lindsay Burns (Harvard,'87), third in the women's single sculls, is now working on aPh.D. in neuropsychology at Cambridge University.   And the fact that most top-level U.S. rowers came to thesport relatively late in life is widely seen as a plus. &quot;Iswam as a kid, and was burned out by the time I got tocollege,&quot; testifies the 25-year-old Townley. &quot;I haven't hadtime to burn out in rowing yet.&quot;   The national championships were staged on a club basis,with some teams combining athletes of different skills, and,thus, weren't as crucial for selecting U.S.team members forthe August worlds in Vienna and the Olympics beyond as somelater meets will be. Moreover, race times mean little inrowing because they are particularly affected by weather andwater conditions, and the precursor of a line of storms thatvisited the area late Saturday afternoon knocked manyclockings out of kilter.   A few performances did stand out, though, among them asnappy showing early Saturday by a team of David Gleeson,Robert Kaehler, Keir Pearson and Allan Green in the quadruplesculls, an event in which the U.S. had been lagginginternationally; the surprise victory in the women's singlesculls on Sunday by 30-year-old Angie Herron, a one-timeworld lightweight champ who's a coach at Penn (there is nolightweight competition in the Olympics); and a triumph inthe meet-finale men's eights by the Pre-Elite Heavies, anall-star crew put together with an eye to the world meet.   And, besides, there was the lift that any competitionbrings athletes for whom training is far more toil than play.&quot;When you work out as hard as we do, meets are like areward,&quot; says Porterfield, a congenial 24-year-old. &quot;At thispoint, whatever medals we get are gravy.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
