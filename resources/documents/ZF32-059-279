(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Hercules Computer Technology Inc.andM;SUPERSTATION 3DandM;The SuperStation 3D can be considered either a very high-end graphics boardor a midrange applications accelerator.andP;  It is a single-board subsystem thatwill run on ISA (PC AT) or EISA (16-bit only) computers.andM;The board includes a 32-bit Texas Instruments TMS34020 graphics processor anda 64-bit Intel i860 RISC processor; the application determines which is used.andO;The SuperStation 3D holds as much as 16M bytes of program memory using twoindustry-standard single in-line memory modules, and comes with 2M bytes ofvideo memory.andP;  The SuperStation 3D also supports VGA pass-through via aninternal connector.andM;Since the i860 chip is a general-purpose RISC processor, it can also be usedfor number-crunching applications.andM;Rather than being set at a fixed resolution, the SuperStation 3D isprogrammable, from 512 by 480 pixels up to 1,280 by 1,024 pixels.andM;At its highest resolution, the board supports 8 bits per pixel, or 256colors.andP;  At lower resolutions, it supports 15 bits per pixel (32,768 colors)and 24 bits per pixel (16.7 million colors).andM;Two of the resolutions the SuperStation 3D supports -- 756 by 486 and 768 by576 -- are appropriate for commercial NTSC and PAL, respectively, televisionbroadcasting.andM;The board also includes genlock support, which is desirable for professionalvideo output.andP;  In addition, in some modes the SuperStation 3D supports doublebuffering.andM;These capabilities make the SuperStation 3D a good candidate for multimediause and a practical alternative to the standard Vistaandplus; or Targaandplus; boards fromTruevision Inc.andM;The SuperStation 3D has no special hardware provisions for shading, depthcuing or anti-aliasing.andP;  Still, the i860 processor has the capability, withthe right programming, to accomplish all of these tasks successfully.andM;AutoCAD/386 and Windows 3.0 drivers are included with the SuperStation 3D.andM;The AutoCAD driver is the protected-mode display-list type, meeting theAutodesk Device Interface (ADI) 4.1 specification.andM;While it includes bird's-eye and spyglass view ports, it is missing some ofthe more subtle features of more mature drivers such as those from Matrox.andM;The Windows driver uses TIGA 2.0 to access the TMS34020, reaping the benefitsof the chip's fast bit-block transfer capabilities.andM;The Windows driver can run at any resolution supported by the board.andP;  TheSuperStation 3D runs Windows as fast as other 34020 boards.andP;  Users willlikely find many uses for the SuperStation 3D, but the board really shineswhen supporting animation.andM;Users of photo-realistic rendering software such as Modern Medium Inc.'sRenderStar 2 or Graphics Software Inc.'s Big-D will find the SuperStation3D's combination of true-color output, video-resolution options, genlocksupport and i860 power very appealing.andM;------------------&quot;VITAL SIGNS&quot; DATAandM;Hercules ComputerandM;Technology Inc.andM;Berkeley, Calif.andP;  (415) 540-6000andM;Privately heldandM;Year established: 1982andM;Number of employees: Not disclosedandM;Gross annual revenue (1990):andM;not disclosedandM;Gross annual earnings (1990):andM;not disclosedandM;Source.andP;  Information supplied by company.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
