Or are they innate, some sort of sixth sense a lucky few are born with? Richard Dennis, the legendary Chicago commodity trader, who turned a grubstake of $400 into an estimated $200 million or so in 18 years, has no doubt. Following an experiment with a group of would-be traders recruited from around the country, he's convinced the secrets of commodity trading can be learned.    Over the past 4 1/2 years, a group of 14 commodity traders he taught earned an average annual compound rate of return of 80%. In contrast, about 70% of all non-professional commodity traders lose money on a yearly basis.    &quot;Trading was even more teachable than I imagined,&quot; he says. &quot;In a strange sort of way, it was almost humbling.&quot;    Mr. Dennis says he had debated the learning vs. innate-ability question with some of his associates for years. While they argued that his skills are &quot;ineffable, mystical, subjective or intuitive,&quot; he says, his own answer was far simpler. The 40-year-old Mr. Dennis attributes his success to several trading methods he developed and, perhaps more important, the discipline to follow those methods.    To prove his point, Mr. Dennis decided to run a real-life experiment. In late 1983 and again in 1984, he placed ads in The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and the New York Times seeking people who wanted to be trained as traders. The job required that they move to Chicago, where they would receive a small salary and a percentage of any profits while Mr. Dennis taught them his methods.    About 1,000 applicants answered each ad. He selected 80 people to come to Chicago for interviews. From these, he chose 13 for the program in 1984 and 10 in 1985. During the four years of the program, three people were dropped. Of the remaining 20, 16 are known to be trading public funds, three are believed to be trading for themselves, and one has gone into another field.    The students were called the &quot;turtles.&quot; (Mr. Dennis, who says he had just returned from Asia when he started the program, explains that he described it to someone by saying, &quot;We are going to grow traders just like they grow turtles in Singapore.&quot;)    Mr. Dennis provided classroom training for two weeks, teaching the fundamentals of commodity trading and the principles behind his methods of trading. In general, Mr. Dennis is known as a trend-following trader, that is, one who determines that a market is moving up or down and then takes an appropriate position to profit from that movement. When classroom work ended he gave each student $1 million in capital to trade.    In choosing participants for the program, Mr. Dennis says he was biased toward people with mathematical and game-playing aptitudes. For example, Elizabeth Cheval, 33, the only woman admitted to the turtle program, had a bachelor's degree in mathematics and was a clerk on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade when she heard of the search.    Ms. Cheval, who now trades for others, says the most important thing she learned was the discipline required to trade well. &quot;Rich often said if you have an inferior trading system and stick with it, then you are better off than if you have the best trading system in the world and can't stick with it.&quot;    Jerry Parker, 32, who was a certified public accountant before he became a turtle, says the most important thing he learned from Mr. Dennis is &quot;to do the right thing every day -- both in the market and in life.&quot; Mr. Parker says &quot;doing the right thing&quot; in the market means following the rules of the trading system and good money management.    During the selection process Mr. Dennis asked applicants to describe the riskiest thing they had ever done. He wanted to see if they took calculated risks or risk for its own sake. The answers he got ranged from one applicant who drove an hour to a basketball game without having a ticket to get in, to another who drove around Saudi Arabia for several months with whiskey in his car trunk -- a very serious offense. The former was admitted to the program; the latter wasn't.    Russell Sands, 34, another turtle, recently formed a partnership with Mr. Parker to trade commodities for others. He told Mr. Dennis that the riskiest thing he ever did was quit a job on Wall Street to move to Las Vegas to play backgammon and blackjack professionally. He won a world championship in backgammon in 1980.    The most successful turtle was apparently Curtis Faith. Trading records show that Mr. Faith, who was only 19 when he started the program, made about $31.5 million in profits for Mr. Dennis.    Mr. Faith says he was so successful because &quot;I went into it with the least fear, probably because of my age.&quot; Despite his success, Mr. Faith no longer trades commodities. Although he doesn't rule out a return to trading, he says, &quot;it's not fun anymore.&quot; He has now started several computer-related businesses in Nevada.    Mr. Dennis says that if he had it to do over again, there is only one thing he would do differently: limit the incentive fee to 15% of profits instead of the average 20% the turtles received.    He estimates that he paid the turtles between $30 million and $35 million in incentive fees over the four years. He says he never believed the turtles could make as much money as they did.    Mr. Dennis's own fortunes suffered a reversal last year. In March 1988 two public funds for which Mr. Dennis was the commodity trading adviser and the general partner were dissolved after losing about 50% of their equity in a relatively short period. Soon after that, he quit trading for himself as well as for others.    Mr. Dennis is now president of &quot;New Perspectives Quarterly,&quot; a publication that explores policy implications for the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara, Calif. He is also involved in other activities, including the Washington-based Drug Policy Foundation.    In an interview in July, Mr. Dennis said that he didn't miss trading and that he has wanted to do something else for a long time. Recently, however, rumors have surfaced, both on and off the trading floor, that he has returned to speculating.    Mr. Dennis won't confirm or deny that he's gotten back into commodities. His explanation: &quot;Whatever uncertainty that exists about whether I am trading now or in the future, the better it is for me.&quot;    Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:    Energy    Oil traders this week will be examining whether the markets will continue to shrug off reports of rising production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.    In August, OPEC's daily production increased to around 22 million barrels a day, the highest of the year, some analysts say. So far, the markets appear to be absorbing the output, and the industry is mixed as to whether demand through the rest of the year will continue as strong. Some market participants believe that demand into the colder fourth quarter will rise sufficiently to absorb growing OPEC output, but others predict prices will soften because of an anticipated oversupply.    Activity recently has been sluggish, both because of uncertainty and the absence of many market players on holiday. Many traders expect the rather narrow trading to continue until the OPEC committee meeting, scheduled to begin Sept. 23.    During the holiday weekend, trading in Europe was extremely slow as U.S. markets were closed yesterday for Labor Day. In London, Brent crudes rose five cents to 10 cents a barrel in quiet trading.    Grains and Soybeans    Futures prices are likely to follow a choppy sideways path until the U.S. Department of Agriculture releases this month's crop report next Tuesday, analysts said.    In the meantime, they caution, soybean futures prices might be under pressure this week if history is any guide. In recent years immediately following a drought year such as 1988 -- including 1975, 1981 and 1984 -- soybean futures prices fell on the Tuesday after Labor Day, said Richard Feltes, vice president, research, for Refco Inc. in Chicago.    He said the expectation of lower prices today contributed to price weakness Friday, when soybeans for November delivery fell 8 1/2 cents to close at $5.79 a bushel.    Sugar    The question of when India is going to buy sugar wasn't answered Friday, when that nation rejected all offerings on 200,000 tons of refined sugar it was seeking, causing futures prices to ease. But traders are confident India will return and take a large amount of sugar off the market.    India apparently rejected the offerings as too high-priced, one analyst said. It isn't unusual for India to reject first offerings, the analyst said. But the seemingly severe shortage of sugar in India should force that nation into the market soon, he said.    India caused a bullish stir in the market early last month, when it was expected to buy 300,000 to 500,000 tons, said Arthur Stevenson, writing in Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.'s latest Futures Agricultural Report. Several days ago, India asked for offers Friday on just 200,000 tons. Mr. Stevenson said U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts assume that India will import at least 300,000 tons of sugar in its next season, which begins Oct. 1.    Cotton    Traders will return from the long Labor Day weekend wondering whether the persistent decline in futures prices will continue.    On Aug. 24, cotton for December delivery traded at a life-of-contract high of 77.34 cents a pound. By Friday, that contract was as low as 72.75 cents, 4.59 cents below its peak.    Buying interest appeared to run out as the contract reached its August high, Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache, said. The subsequent decline was accelerated by computer-guided selling as the price fell below certain support levels, he said.    The market's bullish fundamentals haven't changed, Mr. Simon said. He cited anticipated lower production in the U.S., higher world consumption and, most importantly, a significant drop in stocks when the current season ends July 31, 1990.    &quot;Actually, what might have encouraged some selling is improved weather in growing areas in Texas and in the Mississippi Delta,&quot; he said. @ --- @ A Turtle Race Worth Watching @ Performance of 14 commodity-trading advisers taught by Richard Dennis @ Average First @ Annual Half Annual Quarterly @ Compound 1989 Returns Returns @ Return* Return (Range: 85-88)* (Range: 85-89)* @ Stig Ostgaard @ 124.1% 0.4% 87.8% to 296.7% -49.0% to 317.5% @ Elizabeth Cheval @ 114.1% 41.1% 51.6% to 178.0% -27.1% to 203.3% @ Michael Cavallo @ 107.7% 16.1% 33.6% to 307.4% -54.7% to 195.5% @ Chesapeake** @ 94.4% 6.4% 45.7% to 147.7% -13.1% to 160.1% @ Paul Rabar @ 89.1% 20.0% 78.1% to 125.9% -24.8% to 189.6% @ Philip Lu @ 88.9% 36.0% 36.3% to 132.3% - 9.2% to 148.2% @ Craig Soderquist @ 82.4% 21.3% 58.9% to 135.9% -20.0% to 132.2% @ James DiMaria @ 70.9% 0.8% 17.3% to 154.9% -20.2% to 192.3% @ Brian Proctor @ 64.5% -13.2% -20.1% to 151.9% -41.6% to 155.8% @ Howard Seidler @ 64.2% 23.0% 15.8% to 123.6% -16.6% to 90.3% @ Tom Shanks @ 63.7% 18.8% -29.1% to 195.1% -37.8% to 183.1% @ Jeff Gordon @ 41.8% 16.4% 3.2% to 111.1% - 5.6% to 83.9% @ Michael Carr @ 38.9% 13.7% -18.1% to 88.0% -31.7% to 112.4% @ By comparison @ Barclay CTA Index*** @ 25.1% 10.9% 4.3% to 55.4% -12.1% to 32.4% @ Sandamp;P 500 Index# @ 19.2% 16.5% 5.1% to 31.6% -22.5% to 21.3% @ *Returns overstate performance because traders paid small or no commissions and no management fees through first quarter of 1988.
