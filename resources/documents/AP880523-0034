A computer linkup of the military administration, the police andthe civil and security service offices allows Israel to monitoralmost every aspect of life in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Arab merchants who obey the calls of the uprising's undergroundleaders and refuse to pay taxes are often nabbed in a network ofcomputerized roadblocks.   On the road between Jerusalem and the West Bank town ofBethlehem, an AP reporter saw checkpoints where portable computerswere used to track down tax evaders. Names are taken from identitycards Arabs are required to carry. When the names are entered inthe computer, it identifies those who owe taxes.   The military government demands tax payment in exchange for aregistration of a newborn child or marriage, Palestinians told TheAssociated Press.   ``We are scared. The tax officials catch you and seize your caror impose a huge fine,'' said Fahim, a wholesaler in Ramallah whogave only his first name.   A military government official said about 400 vehicles belongingto delinquent Arab taxpayers have been seized in the West Bank.   The computer ``is indeed the ultimate instrument of populationcontrol, a carrot-and-stick operation,'' researcher MeronBenvenisti wrote in his annual study of the occupied territories.   Benvenisti said Israel started to develop a computerizedoccupied lands data bank in August 1985. The five-year,$8.5-million project was undertaken by TIM, an Israelirepresentative of the U.S. computer company Data General.   The aim was to computerize all information pertaining to thepopulation: ``property, real estate, family ties, politicalattitudes, involvement in illegal activities, licensing,occupations,'' he wrote in the 1987 West Bank Data Project, a studyfinanced by the U.S. Ford and Rockefeller Foundations.   Some of the military government's departments, such as those ofinterior and transport, are almost totally computerized today,providing immediate access to personal and vehicle usage data, asenior Israeli official said.   Military authorities also can gain access to the main policecomputer, linked to all the relevant ministries and principalpolice stations, according to spokeswoman Ruth Schlezinger.   She said by using special passwords, a police official can callup such `subcategories'' as personal data, criminal records ortraffic violations.   The data base was used on a wide scale this month in the GazaStrip, where the army started to exchange 400,000 Palestinians'identity cards for new ones.   At a military office set up at a school in Gaza City's Rimalneighborhood, an AP reporter saw a computer center with 23 portableIBM computers.   Military sources said the computer marked with a star the namesof those wanted for security offenses and a special code appearednext to the names of those who owed taxes.   Some cards also were stamped with a warning: ``The bearer ofthis card is not allowed to travel to Israel.'' That identifies theresidents as ``troublemakers'' in Israel's view and confines themto the Gaza Strip.   The Palestinians have fought back. United Nations Relief andWorks Agency spokesman Bill Lee and Arab reporters saidPalestinians this week burned a telephone junction box believed toserve army computers.   But military officials said Israel is not giving up oncomputers. The army, in fact, is moving ahead with plans tocomputerize the prison system, which has been swamped by the floodof 6,000 people detained in the uprising.</TEXT></DOC>
