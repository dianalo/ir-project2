The Mail on Sunday quoted Nicholas Nicola, who arrived back inBritain on Dec. 27 after his release, as saying he had been keptmostly in solitary confinement except for a weekly shower andinterrogation.   He also confirmed reports that he had been tried, althoughbecause the trial was held in the Farsi language, said he had beenunaware he was serving a 3{-year sentence for possessing weapons,the newspaper reported.   Nicola bought a ticket to Pakistan in 1986 in order to join theAfghan rebels fighting the Soviet-backed Communist government, theMail said.   ``My thoughts were to go and find the mujahedeen (Moslemguerrillas) ... so I could fight against the Russians,'' the weeklypaper quoted him as saying. Soviets troops have backed Afghanistan'scommunist government against the guerrillas in a decade-old conflict.   Dressed in Afghan clothes and carrying a rifle and pistol he hadbought at a market, Nicola told the paper he was in Pakistan on theborder with Iran when an Iranian patrol began running toward him.   ``I think they saw my guns,'' he was quoted as saying.   ``One fired two shots and, without thinking, I fired two shotsinto the air with the rifle,'' he was quoted as saying.   The Iranians beat Nicola, screamed at him and then took him toprison, he said. After his trial, he remained at Tehran's maximumsecurity Evin Prison, the report said.   Nicola said he wasn't sure what to do with his life now, thepaper reported.   ``I have been too naive,'' he was quoted as saying. ``I hadromantic ideas from the movies. I know it isn't like that now.''   His release was the latest sign of a thaw in relations betweenthe countries since they virtually cut diplomatic ties in 1987 aftera dispute which began when British police arrested an Iranian envoyon shoplifting charges.   Roger Cooper, a British businessman who has lived in Iran formore than 20 years, has been jailed there without trial for morethan three years on charges of spying.</TEXT></DOC>
