U.S. officials believe the know-how came fromIsrael.   Senior Bush administration officials said they wereconcerned that the acquisition of in-flight refuelingtechnology, which gives Chinese fighter-bombers a biggerflying range, has come at a time when China is expanding itsmilitary presence on disputed South China Sea islands andpressing its claim to the scattered territories, some ofwhich have oil-drilling potential.</LP><TEXT>   Citing intelligence reports, administration officials saidthe Chinese recently tested a prototype refueling technology.   Two years ago, the Bush administration stopped the sale ofan American aviation company, Mamco Manufacturing Inc., toChina National Aero-Technology Import andamp; Export Corp. for fearit would give China access to in-flight refueling technology.Earlier, a proposed sale of aerial refueling technology tothe Chinese by a British company was halted by theCoordinating Committee on Export Controls, or Cocom, whichmonitors Western technology sales to communist countries.   The U.S. has been investigating alleged Israeli transfersof sensitive U.S. military technology to third countries.That isn't the case here because Washington had refused togive in-flight refueling know-how to Israel on the groundsthat it would give it unnecessary offensive capability. ButIsrael developed the technology with unspecified foreignassistance and is known to have supplied it to South Africa.   In January 1974, China captured the Paracel islands in theSouth China Sea from the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese army.Fourteen years later, the Chinese navy forcefully evicted thecommunist Vietnamese from Fiery Cross island, north of themain Spratly chain.   But military analysts say a lack of air support -- theSpratly chain is 620 miles from China's nearest air base inHainan -- has restricted Chinese activity in the area. Thecountry's longest-range bomber could barely make a returntrip from the Spratlys.   But that handicap will end soon, when a fleet ofChinese-built A-5M Fantan and F-82 twin-enginefighter-bombers fitted with in-flight refueling ducts areintroduced into service. The U.S. officials said Chinese B-6Badger bombers are being converted to aerial tankers, givingChina air superiority in any future operation against islandsin the Spratlys occupied by Vietnam, the Philippines orMalaysia.   Last month, China stunned its neighbors by promulgating alaw that all but turns the South China Sea into a Chineselake. The law proclaims Diaoyutai -- also known as Senkaku,off the northeast coast of Taiwan -- and the Paracels andSpratlys to be Chinese territory, and says China has &quot;theright to adopt all necessary measures to prevent . . . theharmful passage of vessels through its territorial waters.&quot;The law appears to have reversed China's stance that thequestion of sovereignty should be shelved in order to jointlydevelop the area's economic potential. Japan, which controlsSenkaku, and Vietnam, which still holds parts of theSpratlys, protested, as did other Southeast Asian countries.   Meanwhile, China is strengthening its naval and aircapacity in the South China Sea islands. To bring its airpower closer, China has built a runway and related facilitieson Woody Island in the Paracels. &quot;Clearly, the Chinese aredeveloping the place as a staging area for operation in theSpratlys,&quot; a U.S. official said.   U.S. officials said no drilling has yet been done, but theChinese seem to believe the seabed contains oil. Becauseestimates of China's oil reserves suggest the country willbecome a net oil importer in the next century, Beijing isplacing importance on developing the Tarim Basin in Xinjiangprovince and the South China Sea.</TEXT></DOC>
