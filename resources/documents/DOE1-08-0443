Fifteen wastes (and dichloromethaneextracts of these wastes) from a variety of manufacturing processes weretested for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100with and without Aroclor 1254-induced rat-liver S9. Ten of these wasteswere fed by gavage to F-344 male rats, and the raw urines were assayedfor mutagenicity in the presence of beta-glucuronidase in strain TA98with S9. Six of these urines were extracted by C18/methanol elution,incubated with beta-glucuronidase, and evaluated in strain TA98 withS9 and beta-glucuronidase. Fourteen of the wastes were examined for theirability to induce prophage lambda in Escherichia coli in a microsuspensionassay. A second set of wastes, consisting of four industrial wastes,were evaluated in Salmonella and in a series of mammalian cell assaysto measure mutagenicity, cytogenetic effects, and transformation.</TEXT></DOC>
