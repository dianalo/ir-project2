It looks as ifsomething other than waste, fraud and abuse was accomplishedon Ronald Reagan's watch. But Americans who are takingjustifiable pride in victory over Iraq should now keep theireyes on the defense issue: On current trends, the U.S. maynot have the military strength to do Operation Desert Stormagain even by 1995.   Asked about this by Indiana Senator Dan Coats at a hearinglast month, Defense Secretary Cheney said, &quot;It clearly wouldbe more difficult.&quot; General Colin Powell added that &quot;we wouldhave great difficulty executing Desert Shield/Desert Storm&quot;in the same way by mid-decade. Mr. Bush's national securityadviser, Brent Scowcroft, said Sunday that the U.S. might notbe able to mount the same effort even two years from now.</LP><TEXT>   The nearby chart shows what has these men worried. Mr.Bush's recent budget request would slash defense spending to3.8% of the economy by 1996, the lowest level since 1939 (seeaccompanying chart -- WSJ March 5, 1991). And that's thebest-case &quot;ceiling&quot; negotiated under last year's budgetagreement. Congress wants to chop it up even more. Thanks tobudget director Dick Darman's negotiating, defense spendingwill fall by 11.3% after adjusting for inflation in fiscalyear 1991, the sixth real decline in a row.   If this is all Americans want to spend on defense, that'sdemocracy. But the remarkable fact about these record cuts isthat they're occurring without much of a public debate. Mr.Darman and Congressional Democrats both have a stake inkeeping the cuts quiet, so they can claim their budget dealis a success. But the cuts are the sort of thing potentialadversaries watch very closely for evidence of U.S.capabilities. If the U.S. really wants to return to pre-PearlHarbor spending levels now, then let's at least admit thatthat's what we're doing.   Mr. Cheney, we should add, has recently laid out a newmilitary strategy that would make the most of what money he'sgoing to get. It recognizes the collapse of the Warsaw Pact,allowing a reduction of forces in Europe and a much smallerarmy (to 18 from 28 divisions). It cuts the Navy and AirForce somewhat less, playing to U.S. strengths in technologyand mobility.   Aircraft carrier groups would still fall to 12 in theCheney plan, the same number Jesse Jackson endorsed in the1988 campaign. And tactical fighter wings would fall to 26from 36. The Army will claim that the Iraq war showed thevalue of mechanized armor, but the larger lesson is thattanks are sitting ducks without air power.   The Cheney-Bush strategy also proposes a more vigorousstrategic defense to cope with the growing threat of ThirdWorld ballistic missiles (15 nations by the year 2000,according to the CIA's latest count). And it proposes a new&quot;contingency force,&quot; a highly mobile and flexible commandthat can swiftly meet emerging regional threats.   Perhaps most important, Mr. Cheney stresses research anddevelopment of new technologies, though still less than wethink is warranted. One of Desert Storm's unhappy secrets isthat as well as U.S. technology worked, it could have beenbetter. The guidance on cruise missiles and smart bombs canbe even more precise, and use of such space technologies asthe Global Positioning System can be much better integratedinto the battle plan. Advancing these frontiers plays to theU.S.'s comparative advantage, and it would keep a defensebase in place in case of a Stalinist reversal in the SovietUnion.   It's interesting now to recall the anti-defense euphoriathat seized Democratic Washington after the Berlin Wall fell,taking Communism with it. The defense budget became a honeypot to rob for a &quot;domestic agenda&quot; that seems destined to cryout into eternity for ever-larger infusions of spending. TheBush administration gave in more than it should have, butSaddam Hussein alerted everyone that peace isn't permanent.   Our own view is that the current spending trend sets us upfor what might be called imperial understretch -- a mismatchbetween military ends and means. If the U.S. wants to remaina superpower, exercising global leadership on behalf offreedom, then it must have the means to project power aroundthe world. The Bush-Cheney defense request is as close ashave as that leadership can take, even assuming everythinggoes fairly well in the world. Anything less and we'reheading toward Fortress America. It's time to put a floorunder defense cuts.</TEXT></DOC>
