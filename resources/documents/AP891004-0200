(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A jury Wednesday began deliberating thefraud and conspiracy charges against PTL founder Jim Bakker andmust decide if he is the ``world-class'' con man prosecutorscontend, or the victim of circumstance his lawyers say.   Bakker is accused of diverting more than $3.7 million in PTLmoney to live in high style, buying Rolls-Royces, lavish homes, rawdiamonds, an air-conditioned doghouse and furnishings ranging frommirrored walls and gold-plated swan bathroom fixtures to motorizedbedroom drapes and gigantic walk-in closets.   ``I feel fine,'' Bakker said as he and his wife, Tammy Faye,left the federal courthouse. Asked if he was worried about theoutcome, Bakker responded, ``No I'm trusting God.''   ``Last night, we had a great dinner together,'' he said. ``Weslept like babies,'' Mrs. Bakker added.   The jury returned to the courtroom several times after gettingthe case Wednesday morning. One of the jurors' requests was forevidence relating to wire fraud charges.   The jury also asked U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter forclarification of a charge, two boxes of government exhibits and anexplanation of federal statutes relating to mail and wire fraud andconspiracy.   The jury recessed its deliberations at 6 p.m.   Bakker, 49, is charged in U.S. District Court with 15 counts ofwire fraud, eight counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracyto commit wire and mail fraud.   Prosecutors contend that Bakker solicited money for ``lifetimepartnerships'' at his Heritage USA retreat near Fort Mill, S.C.,but used the the money for projects other than the lodging hepromised. Lifetime partners typically paid $1,000 for the promiseof three nights and four days annually at the theme park. Bakkerraised $158 million through partnership sales.   He resigned from the ministry in 1987 amid a sex and moneyscandal.   Potter instructed the jury Tuesday night after closing arguments.   ``You can't lie to people to send you money _ it's thatsimple,'' prosecutor Deborah Smith told the jury.   ``You can't tell half-truths. If you do it, if you use thepostal service and the public airwaves you will find yourself infederal court answering charges of mail and wire fraud. That's whywe're here today, because that's just what Mr. Bakker did.''   Bakker's attorneys said he was a victim of circumstances and aminister worried about the survival of his church.   ``I think 95 percent of the evidence in this case by thegovernment is circumstantial,'' said defense attorney George Davis.   ``The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that thedefendant had specific intent to commit fraud,'' Davis said. ``Hewas conducting a ministry. He was doing what he thought was vitalto the survival of his ministry.''   Smith insisted that the case was about money, not religion:``What unfolded before you over the past month was a tale ofcorruption _ immense corruption. ... What was revealed here wasthat Mr. Bakker was a world-class master of lies and half-truths.''   If convicted on all counts, Bakker faces up to 120 years inprison and more than $5 million in fines.</TEXT></DOC>
