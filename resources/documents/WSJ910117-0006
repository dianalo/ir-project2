Computer Associates, a giant software company that hasfocused on large computer set-ups, also said it joined twoindustry organizations that promote Unix, which mostly runson networks of smaller computers. The firm portrayed themoves as its formal entry into the Unix marketplace, althoughComputer Associates already sells Unix products and hadpreviously declared its intention to expand its efforts inthe area.</LP><TEXT>   Unix, which handles basic housekeeping for computers, isgaining popularity because it is well-suited for computernetworks and doesn't make users dependent on specifichardware. But the software still lacks much of the basiccapabilities that companies need to perform day-to-day tasksnow done by mainframes and minicomputers, most of which don'trun Unix. Computer Associates said it wants to fill that gapby adapting its existing software for Unix.   Although Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, Calif., said itinitiated the talks that led to the new joint-developmentagreement with Computer Associates, both companies willbenefit from the arrangement. Hewlett-Packard will have thefirst Unix computers to run Computer Associates' popularsoftware, while Computer Associates will have a major Unixplayer promoting its wares.   The companies said a first round of products -- mostly&quot;systems management&quot; tools -- will be available within ayear. Other products, including business applications, willfollow, although the companies didn't give a timetable forthose.</TEXT></DOC>
