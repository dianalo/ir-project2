It is intendedto summarize the observations and to organize these results in termsof models of cosmic ray sources. The following paper by David Eichlercomplements this one by dealing with the theory of cosmic ray acceleration.Three types of date are considered here. First are the abundances ofelements, in particular the recently measured abundances of the veryrare elements with atomic number (Z) greater than 30, which are calledultraheavy (UH) elements in cosmic ray literature. Abundances of individualelements have been measured for every element with Z andless; 33 and for even-Zelements with Z andless; 60. In addition, abundances have been measured withresolution of approximately plus-or-minus unit of atomic number at higherZ. It is clear from these observations that the cosmic ray source differsin composition from the solar system in significant ways, while the generaltrend of abundances is the same. The author discusses the significanceof the differences both with respect to the nucleosynthesis of the materialand the cosmic ray acceleration process. The second type of data areisotopic abundances. Individual isotopes have been resolved for the mostabundant elements in the cosmic rays. Finally, he describes three observationsthat have been made of cosmic ray antiprotons. The observed antiprotonflux is distinctly higher than that predicted from standard models ofsecondary production resulting from cosmic ray proton collisions withnuclei of the interstellar gas. Two of these observations can be interpretedas requiring some changes in the standard models of cosmic ray propagationin the galaxy, while the other observation, at lower energies, is moredifficult to reconcile with secondary antiproton origin.</TEXT></DOC>
