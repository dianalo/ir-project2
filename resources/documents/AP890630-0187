AIM said the platoon, led by 18-year-old Joaquim Romao andconsisting mostly of boys aged eight to 14, surrendered Tuesday inthe town of Manjacaze, in the southern province of Gaza. It said therebels sought out a well-known local traditional healer and askedhim to make contact with the army.   The government has said hundreds of rebels of the MozambiqueNational Resistance have surrended since an amnesty law was passedin December 1987.   The resistance has been fighting the Marxist government for 12years. The guerrillas first were aided by the white government ofRhodesia, then by South Africa. No government acknowledges helpingthe guerrillas, who are accused of destroying villages, burningcrops, mutilating peasants and abducting children and women to carrylooted goods.   AIM quoted Romao as saying his group left a base at Chococha inInhambane province to seek food in nearby villages, but insteadcrossed into Gaza and sought out the healer, Mungoi, who has beenreported in the past to have contacts with the guerrillas.   ``We were tired of suffering in the bush, so we decided tosurrender,'' Romao was quoted as saying. Mungoi collected therebels' weapons and sent a messenger to the army at Manjacazi, whocame to accept the surrender, AIM said.   Romao said his group had numbered 27, but one ran away when hesaw the soldiers coming. The guerrillas were taken to the Gazaprovincial capital of Xai-Xai, where they were seen by AIM.</TEXT></DOC>
