Stanley Lieberson, who has begun a scientific study of namefads, says he first got interested in the phenomenon after choosingwhat he thought was an uncommon name, Rebecca, for his eldestdaughter in 1961.   ``In nursery school and kindergarten and through the years ofgrade school and onward there were always a bunch of Beckies thatshe knew,'' the professor said recently. ``Somehow there wassomething out there in the society that led parents, withouttalking to each other, to reach a conclusion.''   In a search for possible social cues to parents, Lieberson begancompiling health department lists of all babies born in Californiafrom 1905 to 1984. He also has data on upstate New York from 1973to 1985, Wisconsin from 1979 to 1986, and various lists from othercountries.   Lieberson got the data by writing to various agencies and takingwhatever records were available on computer tape.   Now he'll track the rise and fall of popular names. He also willcheck them against the historical backdrop _ World War I or theGreat Depression, for example _ to see if parents tend to nametheir children after newsmakers.   If that's true, for example, there might have been a crop ofboys named Douglas when World War II hero Gen. Douglas MacArthurloomed large on front pages.   Early findings suggest that male and female forms of a name,such as Michael and Michelle, often become popular at the same time.   Also, Lieberson said, ``The rate of change appears to move morerapidly that it used to be.''   Parents tend to be more creative naming girls and give boysconservative monikers, he said.   An exception is the name Gary, which was popular, Liebersonnotes, at a time when film star Gary Cooper swapped his real name,Frank, for that of an Indiana steel town.   In California from 1932 to 1952, Gary increased from only 81instances to the ninth most popular boy's name in the state. But in1984, Gary was absent from the list of the top 100 names.   As families become more loose-knit, parents who normally wouldname children after uncles and aunts may be looking to screen andsports celebrities for inspiration, the professor theorizes.   For instance, he says the recent popularity of the name Ashleymight have been inspired by the spread of Laura Ashley women'sclothes stores _ or by Ashley Abbott, a character on the soapopera, ``The Young and the Restless.''</TEXT></DOC>
