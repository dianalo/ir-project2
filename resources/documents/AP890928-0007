The provision, said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., ``wouldjeopardize the pension levels of millions of employees andretirees'' and encourage companies to drop pension protection forworkers.   ``This is where America should be going in cooperation betweenemployers and employees,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif. ``Thisis about fairness; it's about equity and control of your owndestiny as an American worker.   The provision, which would have required that half the trusteescontrolling single-employer pension plans be workers, was removedfrom the budget bill on a 250-173 vote. Republicans voted almostsolidly against it.   By a 390-36 margin, the House voved to repeal a 1986 provision,fought vigorously by business, that prohibits employers fromclaiming tax deductions for health plans that discriminate againstlower-paid workers.   Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., chief sponsor of repealing theprovision, known as Section 89, said the tests required to provenon-discrimination are an expensive maze of complexity _ a goodidea that simply cannot be put into practice.   ``The only question America has is `why did it take so long'''to repeal? said Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass. ``Where is thedocumentation that a problem existed (requiring the rules)? Thereis none.''   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the Ways and MeansCommittee, proposed wiping out most of the non-discriminationcomplexity but still requiring employers to prove thattax-subsidized health plans are not provided solely for executives.   ``Full repeal will do nothing but result in discrimination, pureand simple,'' Rostenkowski said.   Meanwhile, a vote was scheduled for next week on a new proposalfrom two key subcommittee chairmen to repeal much of thecatastrophic care provisions added to Medicare last year _ and torepeal the unpopular income surtax for the elderly that financesthe program.   Reps. Fortney H. Stark, D-Calif., chairman of the Ways and Meanssubcommittee dealing with health care, and Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,chairman of a health subcommittee of the energy and commercecommittee, would leave intact provisions paying for prescriptiondrugs.   Next week's vote would be on whether to advance the Stark-Waxmanproposals instead of the section of the overall bill reported bythe Ways and Means Committee that would cut the surtax in half.   Wednesday's votes came as President Bush continued seekingsupport for his proposal to cut taxes on capital gains andDemocratic leaders sought to defeat it with a substitute plan toliberalize tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts.   Members on both sides of the capital-gains question guessed thatbackers of the reduction held a slight advantage on the eve ofThursday's scheduled vote.   Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., who has led opposition to thereduction, refused to concede. ``Nobody has the votes,'' he said.``It will be close. ... We will keep working and we are veryencouraged by the response.''   At the White House, Bush restated his support for the cut andaccused Democrats of distorting the issue by calling it a taxreduction for the rich. ``They are wrong,'' he told reporters.   Bush emphasized that the Democratic alternative for expandedIRAs would be financed by a tax increase, which would affect thenation's 600,000 wealthiest people. A vote for IRAs, he said, willbe a vote for higher taxes.   In the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen,D-Texas, introduced with support of 34 other Democrats his plan forexpanding IRAs _ but without the tax increase.   The capital-gains cut is part of a 2,000-page bill designedprincipally to reduce the deficit by $16.6 billion in the budgetyear that begins Oct. 1.   The defeated plan to give employees a vote in how their pensionfunds are invested was one of scores of provisions in the bill thatare unrelated to deficit reduction.   Another labor-backed provision remains in the bill. It wouldprohibit employers from recovering pension assets when a plan isterminated. The Labor Committee said that would discourageemployers from killing a plan in order to use the money for otherpurposes.   Rep. Peter Visclosky, D-Ind., wrote the provision giving workersequal representation on boards of trustees that administeremployer-financed pension plans. It would have applied to anestimated 1.5 million single-employer plans, including those knownas Section 401(k) plans. Plans covering more than one company havehad worker trustees for 40 years.   Viscosky said he was motivated by a government report estimatingthat 40 percent of corporate takeovers result in the termination ofone or more worker pension funds.   ``It is unworkable, untenable and unbelievable,'' Mrs. Roukemacontended. She noted the Labor Department opposes the provision andsaid there is no need for such a change because federal law alreadyrequires that pension trustees act solely in the interest ofbeneficiaries.</TEXT></DOC>
