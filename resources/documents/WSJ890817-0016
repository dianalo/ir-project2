At stake is the &quot;parallel-track&quot; proposal of Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Dr. Fauci has urged adoption of a two-track system for granting access to experimental drugs to people who don't qualify as test subjects.    Volunteers are frequently denied a space in a clinical trial because their condition and specific symptoms don't match strict test requirements for entry. Some have taken too many prior medications, while others don't live near enough to research institutions conducting a clinical trial.    &quot;Sometimes the design of a classical drug trial seems very cold and aloof,&quot; Dr. Fauci acknowledged at a meeting with AIDS clinicians and activists last month.    At least one company, Bristol-Myers Co., has said it plans to make its promising AIDS drug DDI available to patients in critical need, even as the drug enters trials to determine its effectiveness next month. However, officials of the Department of Health and Human Services so far have not come to an agreement on a &quot;parallel track&quot; distribution program. Expense and liability, as well as entry criteria, are details on which officials haven't been able to reach a consensus.    As a preface to today's meeting in Bethesda, Md., activists have sought to hammer out preliminary agreement on some of the details. A consensus statement signed by the American Foundation for AIDS Research and 16 other activist groups was sent to Louis Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services, and other government officials.    The document urges that access to the &quot;parallel track&quot; be accorded to all patients for whom there is no standard treatment, or for whom the standard treatment has failed or proven too toxic. People also should be included who must remain on medications that exclude them from test participation, it argues. In addition, it says people who live too far from a test site, or who are too sick to participate in a controlled trial, should be given equal access. </TEXT></DOC>
