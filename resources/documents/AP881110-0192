(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Unisys Corp. pleaded guilty Thursday tothree counts of mischarging the Army on a $9.2 million contract andagreed to pay $810,600 in fines and other penalties.   The action presented for the first time Thursday in U.S. DistrictCourt involved mischarges and misallocation of labor chargesstemming from a five-year computer software contract between SperryCorp., a predecessor of Unisys, and the Army's Information SystemsCommand at Fort Huachuca in Sierra Vista, Ariz., said assistant U.S.Attorney Gary Korn.   Under the plea agreement, Unisys was assessed $250,000 incriminal penalties, $250,000 in civil restitution, $250,000 in civildouble damages, $60,000 as full payment for the government'sinvestigative costs and $600 in special assessments.   The improper activities occurred at Sperry's Technical ServicesDivision office in Sierra Vista, the government and Unisys said.   Korn said the local manager directed employees to charge the Armyfor work done under one delivery order to a subsequent order.   When the company reached the spending ceiling on a given order,it should have stopped work or asked the Army whether to stop orfinish, and for additional money, Korn said.   ``They never did that,'' Korn said, saying the motive was theneed to avoid exceeding estimated costs to keep getting the contractrenewed annually.   Andrew D. Hendry, Unisys vice president and general counsel,pleaded guilty on the company's behalf to three felony false-claimscharges in which it misallocated labor charges totaling $250,000 in1985, 1986 and early 1987.   Korn said the mischarging amounted to overcharging ``in the sensethat they didn't ask for more money and went and spent it anyway.''   The case was presented to U.S. District Judge Richard Bilbyfollowing a 1{-year investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
