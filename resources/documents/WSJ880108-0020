Bush needs early decisive wins to avoid money problems later. He probably will spend more than two-thirds of the $28 million legal limit by March's Super Tuesday. &quot;Bush won't have any legs&quot; after that, a top Democratic strategist predicts. Dole must win early to hold together his weaker organization. Kemp's bid may die for lack of funds without a strong showing.    Dukakis relies on a fast start to win credibility in the South and to stave off possible late entrants such as Cuomo. Despite a fat war chest, after Super Tuesday he may have to break his vow not to go into debt. Gephardt, Simon and Babbitt all need a win or strong seconds in Iowa and New Hampshire to survive. Jackson figures to go the distance despite money problems.    Gore gains credibility while smartly conserving his cash; he plans a Western push to prove he isn't only a Southern candidate.    RUSSIA MOVES toward joining the U.N. arms embargo against Iran.    &quot;We are seeing a major public change in the Soviet position&quot; after six months of stalling on the U.S.-backed measure, says a State Department official. U.S. officials say the Soviets are responding to intense Arab pressure, culminating with King Hussein's Moscow visit last month. They say that Moscow also feels Iran hasn't shown much gratitude for the Soviet stalling.    The Soviet change, officials say, is most important in increasing pressure on China, which ships Iran 50% of its new supplies. No one thinks all weapons will be cut off. &quot;An arms embargo won't end the Iran-Iraq war,&quot; the State Department official says. &quot;But it will keep weapons out of Tehran's hands that could tip the balance.&quot;    PENTAGON INFIGHTING worsens over where to trim budget proposals.    Military services wrangle over the $33 billion being squeezed out of the next budget. The Army resists chopping 10,000 troops from its active force of 781,000 and faces pressures on its planned $60 billion LHX helicopter. The Navy proceeds with two carriers that will cost over $6 billion. Navy Secretary Webb plans a personal campaign for increased naval power.    In the end, &quot;each service is going to have to cut funding for its rocks,&quot; predicts an Air Force official. One factor is that the budget agreement with Congress prevents the White House from taking money from domestic programs to fund the Pentagon this year. New defense chief Carlucci is to finish a Pentagon budget review by Feb. 5.    The review could further delay Reagan's $1.1 trillion budget beyond the new Feb. 18 target date.    BUSH'S ROLE in the Iran-Contra affair will be a top target in the Des Moines Register debate in Iowa tonight as GOP presidential hopefuls try to gain ground. Dole, an aide says, expects &quot;to really bear down on Bush on the Iran thing.&quot; Bush may attack Dole for proposing an oil-import fee.    KEYNOTE CANDIDATES: New Jersey Sen. Bradley may not be running for president this year, but he lets the Democratic National Committee know that he would like to be the keynote speaker at the Atlanta convention. Other possible keynoters include two Arkansans: Sen. Bumpers and Gov. Clinton.    THRIFTS' WOES dwarf rescue plans. Bank Board Chairman Wall maps a push to deal with sick Texas Sandamp;Ls, but experts say even the $10.8 billion Congress is letting the board borrow for all such efforts wouldn't fix Texas thrifts alone. &quot;The problem is bigger than the plan,&quot; says one Houston banking professor. Yet Wall is loath to ask Congress for help a second year in a row.    FED CHANCES fade for former Citicorp economist Leif Olsen, White House economist Beryl Sprinkel's candidate for a board opening. Fed and Treasury officials are uneasy with Olsen's monetarist bent. And Utah Sen. Garn complains that Olsen lives in a district, New York, already represented on the Fed.    MOMENTUM GROWS for a broad post-crash study of the U.S. financial system.    The idea will get a boost from stock-market crash inquiries such as today's Brady report. Some SEC staffers, frustrated by the rush to complete a similar report soon, advocate a longer look at the overall system. Chairman Ruder agrees, &quot;if it were broad enough to include international questions and if it were well-financed&quot; and done under SEC control.    A federal bar group already is formed to outline such a study. Topics include the impact of new financial products and the gaps in securities laws and the regulatory structure. &quot;People are looking at aspects of the problem, but no one's looking at the whole thing,&quot; says Judge Stanley Sporkin, a former top SEC official. But Congress could balk at a lengthy study.    Some lawmakers fear a major review could be used as an excuse to put off new securities legislation.    MINOR MEMOS: No more Miller Lite? In a meeting on how to trim fat from the budget, OMB Director Miller downs an entire two-pound bag of Mandamp;Ms. . . . Jokesters suggest this opening line for Sen. Biden next week when he meets Neil Kinnock, the British politician whose words he cribbed: &quot;Stop me if you've heard this one.&quot; . . . Babbitt quips privately, &quot;If Gary Hart had ever seen 'Fatal Attraction,' he'd still be the front-runner for the nomination.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
