In general, trading in dollar issues was quiet yesterday. &quot;We still are seeing little retail activity,&quot; said a trader at one major U.S. investment bank. &quot;Most of the activity has been dealer positioning.&quot;    Nonetheless, bond managers found it a good time to launch dollar issues.    &quot;Why isn't it a good time to issue? The stock market is roaring, the dollar is stabilizing and the numbers we've seen haven't told us the U.S. economy&quot; is picking up and fueling inflation, a London trader at a U.S. bank said.    &quot;The new issues have been fairly well received,&quot; a trader said, adding that there was demand for dollar paper in a market that has been relatively quiet this year.    The American Express affiliate issued its $200 million of floating-rate notes due 1999 at par.    Paying 1/8 point over the three-month London Interbank Offer Rate, or Libor, the issue was quoted at 99.78 to 99.82. Lead manager is Shearson Lehman Brothers International.    Some floating-rate note traders said the American Express launch was &quot;brave,&quot; particularly after the perpetual floating-rate note market collapsed again Tuesday. But they also said the issue has done well and could be the start of a new floating-rate note market.    The General Motors unit issued $200 million of 7 3/8% bonds due 1992, priced at 101 to yield 7.13%. Launched through Salomon Brothers International Ltd., the bonds were trading at 101, less 1.85, less 1.70.    West German mark bonds followed New York's firmer trend to close about 0.2 point higher, mostly on short-covering by professional traders on very low volume.    The West German government's 6 1/8% bonds due 1997 closed at 100.70 bid, up 0.05 from Tuesday. The government's 5 3/4% bonds due 1997 also were 0.05 point firmer, closing at 98.25.    Swiss franc foreign bonds ended the day flat as the market continued to be flooded with tightly priced issues that don't appear to be selling well. </TEXT></DOC>
