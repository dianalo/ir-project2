Every product in the supermarket nowadvertises what it doesn't contain: &quot;no cholesterol,&quot; &quot;sugar-free,&quot; &quot;low fat,&quot;&quot;high fiber,&quot; &quot;reduced salt,&quot; and so on.;    What the labels don't tellshoppers is what it means: Did they do something to the product to take outthe cholesterol, or is it the sort of thing that doesn't have cholesterol inthe first place?;    Is the &quot;low calorie&quot; product low because it's made withdifferent ingredients, or because it's half the size of the regular version?;   How can a jar of spaghetti sauce be &quot;fresh&quot;?;    How does &quot;natural&quot; differfrom unnatural? &quot;Lite&quot; from &quot;light&quot;?;    How &quot;high&quot; is &quot;high fiber&quot;?;    Howmuch is a &quot;serving&quot; and why are there 3 2/3 servings in a can? Who gets thetwo-thirds?;    Last year, Congress told the Food and Drug Administration todo something about the sort of labels that persuade Americans the route to ahealthy heart goes through the bakery aisle.;    The FDA's new commissioner,David Kessler, has become the Elliott Ness of nutrition labeling. In April,FDA agents entered a Minnesota warehouse and seized 24,000 half-gallon cartonsof Citrus Hill brand &quot;Fresh Choice&quot; orange juice, the third-largest-sellingbrand in the country.;    Procter andamp; Gamble can sell juice for now, but theseizure will force the company to go to court to prove that the name &quot;FreshChoice&quot; plus the label &quot;pure squeezed 100% orange juice&quot; isn't promisingconsumers fresh, squeezed orange juice.;    If the judge says reconstitutedjuice made by adding water to concentrate  made from oranges is not a &quot;fresh&quot;choice, the whole line will have to be relabeled. How about &quot;Formerly FreshChoice,&quot; the &quot;naturally reprocessed 100% orange concentrate and water&quot;?;   The FDA also forced Pandamp;G and two other companies to drop &quot;no cholesterol&quot; labelfrom Crisco corn oil, Mazola corn oil, and Heartbeat canola oil. It's not thatthe labels are untrue; the cooking oils have no cholesterol. But the contextis false: No vegetable oil has cholesterol. And cooking with oil is not thegreatest way to prevent heart disease, as the heart on Crisco's label seems toimply. Unless your alternative is to cook with lots of animal fat.;    The FDAsaid vegetable oil's fat content &quot;increases the likelihood of cancer, otherchronic diseases and obesity.&quot; The three companies implied that corn oil wasgood for your heart, the FDA charged, while failing to mention diet, weightcontrol or the fat content of the oil.;    Perhaps Crisco's new label willread &quot;BETTER THAN LARD!&quot;;    Under FDA pressure, Pandamp;G has volunteered to stopbragging about the lack of cholesterol in such products as Duncan Hines cakemixes and Pringles potato chips. Other food companies are &quot;studying&quot; theissue.;    The FDA also has hit &quot;fresh&quot; foods in which the label means &quot;nomold growing in container.&quot; This was an aid to consumers who can't figure outthat a jar of Ragu's Fresh Italian Pasta Sauce wasn't made by Mama Ragu thismorning.;    And the FDA is trying to make labels use a real-life &quot;averageserving&quot; -- not the average for anorexics -- when calculating calories, fatand sodium per serving.;    Of course, what's average is a matter of somedebate. The American Butter Institute says the average American uses one teaspoon of butter at a time; the FDA says one tablespoon.;    Since some ofus never quite mastered our weights and measures in the fourth grade becausewe didn't know they'd be on the test and therefore can't do teaspoon/tablespoon arithmetic, the size of the serving will determine the number ofcalories Americans think butter is.;    For all their new-found zeal, I doubtFDA regulators will be able to stay ahead of the game. If &quot;lite&quot; is definedprecisely, some other word to indicate &quot;oh, go ahead, have some, it's good foryou&quot; will be invented to take its place.;    Americans want to believe we canlose weight by eating Dove's sugar-free Three Musketeers Snack Bars (no sugar,lots of fat). We want to believe that pouring a jar of Ragu on the noodles isjust as good as simmering tomatoes and oregano and garlic all day.;    If wereally wanted food that was fresh and natural, high in fiber and low incholesterol, fat, salt and calories, we'd eat fresh vegetables. To avoideating our broccoli, we'll persuade ourselves that chocolate is one of themajor food groups, along  with chips, pizza and ice cream.;    Ultimately,what matters is not the label's relationship to reality but our own personalrelationship with reality.;    The ultimate example of forthright healthlabeling is a new brand of cigarettes now on sale in the Los Angeles area.&quot;Death Cigarettes&quot; come in a black package with a skull and crossbones, thesurgeon general's health warning, and an extra health warning saying thatcigarettes are &quot;addictive and debilitating&quot; and telling smokers to quit. Deathcosts $3 a pack, considerably more than cigarettes marketed as a way to makesmokers sophisticated, sexy , athletic and prone to running at slow motion inmeadows.;    How is Death doing? Stores can't keep the black pack in stock,and a menthol brand is in the works. Prospective name: &quot;Green Death.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Joanne Jacobs column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910530  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  966  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 30, 199100151023,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
