Under open-access, gas pipeline companies are free to allow competitors to use their distribution facilities to transport natural gas. A number of other pipeline concerns have filed similar open-access applications under a recent FERC order that seeks to encourage greater competition and access in the long-distance movement of natural gas.    Pacific Gas Transmission said it will offer interruptible gas transportation service on a first-come, first-served basis, except for the first 10 days following approval of the application when a lottery will be used to establish priorities.    For the past several years, Pacific Gas Transmission said, its system has been used at less than its full capacity of about one billion cubic feet per day, except during the winter months, because of the reduced demand for natural gas. </TEXT></DOC>
