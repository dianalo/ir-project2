Section 4(h) of the Act requiresthat NOAA Fisheries establish agency guidelines which include a priorityranking system for listing, reclassification, or delisting. Section 4(f) of the Act requires NOAA Fisheries to develop and implementrecovery plans for the conservation and survival of all endangered or threatenedspecies, unless such a plan will not promote the conservation of the species.In general, listed species which occur entirely outside U.S. jurisdictionare not likely to benefit from rccovery plans. Foreign species are morelikely to benefit from bilateral or multilateral agreements under Section8 of the Act and other forms of international cooperative efforts. Section4(f) of the Act also requires NOAA Fisheries to give priority to thoseendangered or threatened species (without regard to taxonomic classification)most likely to benefit from such plans, particularly those species thatare, or may be, in conflict with construction or other developmental projectsor other forms of economic activity. Section 4(h) of the Act requires thatNOAA Fisheries establish a system for developing and implementing recoveryplans on a priority basis. The assignment of priorities to listing, reclassification, delisting, andrecovery actions will allow NOAA Fisheries to use the limited resourcesavailable to implement the Act in the most effective way. These proposedguidelines establish priority systems based on: (1) Magnitude of threat;(2) immediacy of threat; (3) recovery potential of the species; (4) conflictstatus of the species; (5) management impact; and (6) petition status.Inasmuch as such assessments are subjective to some degree and individualspecies may not be comparable in terms of all considerations, the proposedpriority systems must be viewed as guidelines and should not be interpretedas inflexible frameworks for making such determinations. These proposed guidelines are based primarily on guidelines published bythe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) on September 21, 1983 (48 FR 43098).NOAA Fisheries believes that, to the extent practical, both agencies shouldfollow similar priority guidelines for listing, reclassification, delistingand recovery. To the extent possible, NOAA Fisheries has adopted the priorityguidelines in use by FWS. However, due to the smaller number of listedspecies and the anticipated smaller number of candidate species under NOAAFisheries jurisdiction, NOAA Fisheries believes that fewer priority categoriesare necessary and the FWS guidelines have been modified accordingly. A. Listing, Reclassification, and Delisting Priorities <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Listing and Reclassification from Threatened to Endangered </ITAG>In considering species to be listed or reclassified from threatened toendangered, two criteria will be evaluated to establish four priority categoriesas shown in Table 1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1.<T4>_Priorities for Listing or Reclassification from Threatened to Endangered.</T4><H1>Magnitude of threat </H1><H1>Immediacy of threat </H1><H1>Priority</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">High <D>Imminent </D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>Non-Imminent </D><D>2 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Low to Moderate <D>Imminent </D><D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>Non-Imminent </D><D>4</D></ITAG> The first criterion, magnitude of threat, gives a higher listing priorityto species facing the greatest threats to their continued existence. Speciesfacing threats of low to moderate magnitude will be given a lower priority.The second criterion, immediacy of threat, gives a higher listing priorityto species facing actual threats than to those species facing threats towhich they are intrinsically vulnerable, but which are not currently active.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Delisting and Reclassification from Endangered to Threatened </ITAG>NOAA Fisheries currently reviews listed species at least every five yearsin accordance with section 4(c)(2) of the Act to determine whether anylisted species qualify for reclassification or removal from the list. Whena species warrants reclassification or delisting, priority for developing   regulations will be assigned according to the guidelines given in Table2. Two criteria will be evaluated to establish six priority categories.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,r25,8</C><T4>Table </T4>2<T4>._Priorities for Delisting and Reclassification from Endangered toThreatened </T4><H1>Management impact </H1><H1>Petition status </H1><H1>Priority</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">High <D>Petitioned Action </D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>Unpetitioned Action </D><D>2 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Moderate <D>Petitioned Action </D><D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>Unpetitioned Action </D><D>4 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Low <D>Petitioned Action </D><D>5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>Unpetitioned Action </D><D>6</D></ITAG> The priorities established in Table 2 are not intended to direct or mandatedecisions regarding a species' reclassification or removal from the list.The priority system is intended only to set priorities for developing rulesfor species that no longer satisfy the listing criteria for their particulardesignation under the Act. The decision regarding whether a species willbe retained on the list, and in which category, will be based on the factorscontained in section 4(a)(1) of the Act and 50 CFR 424.11. The first consideration of the system outlined in Table 2 accounts forthe management impact entailed by a species' inclusion on the list. Managementimpact is the extent of protective actions, including restrictions on humanactivities, which must be taken to protect and recover a listed species.If the current listing is no longer accurate, continuing protective managementactions could divert resources from species more in need of conservationand recovery efforts. Because the Act mandates timely response to petitions,the system also considers whether NOAA Fisheries has been petitioned toremove a species from the list or to reclassify a species from endangeredto threatened. Higher priority will be given to petitioned actions thanto unpetitioned actions that are classified at the same level of managementimpact. There is no direct relationship between the systems outlined in Tables1 and 2. Although the same statutory criteria apply in making listing anddelisting determinations, the considerations for setting listing and delistingpriorities are quite different. Candidate species facing immediate, criticalthreats will be given a higher priority for listing than species beingconsidered for delisting. Likewise, a delisting proposal for a recoveredspecies that would eliminate unwarranted utilization of limited resourcesmay, in appropriate instances, take precedence over listing proposals forspecies not facing immediate, critical threats.B. Recovery Plan Preparation and Implementation Priorities The proposed recovery priority system will be used as a guide for recoveryplan development, recovery task implementation and resource allocation.It consists of two parts_species recovery priority and recovery task priority.Species recovery priority will be used for recovery plan development. Recoverytask priority, together with species recovery priority, will be used toset priorities for funding and performance of individual recovery tasksas explained below. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Species Recovery Priority </ITAG>Species recovery priority is based on three criteria_magnitude of threat,recovery potential and conflict. These criteria are arranged in a matrixyielding twelve species recovery priority numbers (Table 3).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,xs24,r25,r25,8 </C><T4>Table</T4> 3._<T4>Species Recovery Priority </T4><H1>Magnitude of threat </H1><H1>Recovery potential </H1><H1>Conflict </H1><H1>Priority </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">High <D>High </D><D>Conflict </D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>  </D><D>No conflict </D><D>2</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>Low to Moderate </D><D>Conflict </D><D>3</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D> </D><D>No conflict </D><D>4 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Moderate <D>High </D><D>Conflict </D><D>5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D> </D><D>No conflict </D><D>6</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>Low to Moderate </D><D>Conflict </D><D>7</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D> </D><D>No conflict </D><D>8 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Low <D>High </D><D>Conflict </D><D>9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/><D>No conflict </D><D>10</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>Low to Moderate </D><D>Conflict </D><D>11 </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/><D>No conflict </D><D>12</D></ITAG> The first criterion, magnitude of threat, is divided into three categories:high, moderate, and low. The high category means extinction is almost certainin the immediate future because of a rapid population decline or habitatdestruction. Moderate means the species will not face extinction if recoveryis temporarily held off, although there is a continuing population declineor threat to its habitat. Taxa in the low category are rare, or are facinga population decline which may be a short-term, self-correcting fluctuation,or the impacts of threats to the species' habitat are not fully known.The second criterion, recovery potential, assures that resources are usedin the most cost effective manner within each magnitude of threat ranking.Priority for preparing and implementing recovery plans would go to specieswith the greatest potential for success. Recovery potential is based onhow well biological and ecological limiting factors and threats to thespecies' existence are understood, and the extent of management actionsneeded. The recovery potential of a species will be determined by considerationof the criteria given in Table 4.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,r25,r25 </C><T4>Table</T4> 4._<T4>Criteria for Determining Recovery Potential of Listed Species</T4><H1>  </H1><H1>High recovery potential </H1><H1>Low to moderate recovery potential</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Biological and ecological limiting factors <D>Well understood </D><D>Partially or poorly understood. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Threats to species' existence <D>Well understood, easily alleviated </D><D>Partially or poorly understood or pervasive and more difficult to alleviate.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Management needed <D>Intensive management not needed, or techniques well documented withhigh probability of success </D><D>Moderate to intensive management needed with lower probability of success,or techniques experimental or still unknown.</D></ITAG></ITAG> The third criterion, conflict, reflects the Act's requirement that recoverypriority be given to those species that are, or may be, in conflict withconstruction or other developmental projects or other forms of economicactivity. Thus, species judged as being in conflict with such activitieswill be given higher priority for recovery plan development and implementationthan non-conflict species within the same magnitude of threat/recoverypotential ranking. Species in conflict with construction or other developmentalprojects or other forms of economic activity would be identified in largepart through consultations conducted with Federal agencies under section7 of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Recovery Task Priority </ITAG>Recovery plans will identify specific tasks that are needed for the recoveryof a listed species. Recovery tasks will be assigned priorities of l to3 based on the criteria set forth in Table 5.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Table 5. Recovery Task Priority.<ITAG tagnum="21">Priority 1_An action that must be taken to prevent extinction or toprevent the species from declining irreversibly. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Priority 2_An action that must be taken to prevent a significant declinein species population, habitat quality, and/or other significant negativeimpacts short of extinction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Priority 3_All other actions necessary to provide for full recoveryof the species.</ITAG>It should be noted that a Priority 1 ranking is not necessarily given tothe highest priority tasks within a plan, rather it is given to those actions,if any, necessary to prevent a species from declining irreversibly. Priority1 tasks should only apply to species facing a high magnitude of threat(species recovery priority 1-4). When the task priorities (Table 5) are combined with the species recoverypriority (Table 3), the most critical activities for each listed speciescan be identified and evaluated against other species recovery actions.This system recognizes the need to work toward the recovery of all listedspecies, not simply those facing the highest magnitude of threat. In general,NOAA Fisheries intends that Priority 1 tasks will be addressed before Priority2 tasks and Priority 2 tasks before Priority 3 tasks. Within each taskpriority, species recovery priority will be used to further rank tasks.For example, a Priority 1 task for a species with a recovery priority of4 would rank higher than a Priority 2 task for a species with a recoverypriority of 1; and, a Priority 1 task for a species with a recovery priorityof 2 would rank higher than a Priority 1 task for a species with a recoverypriority of 4. For tasks with the same priority ranking, the AssistantAdministrator will determine the appropriate allocation of available resources.C. Recovery Plans As recovery plans are developed for each species, specific recovery tasksare identified and prioritized according to the criteria discussed above.As new information warrants, these plans, including tasks and priorities,will be reviewed and revised. In addition, funding and implementation ofthe tasks identified in recovery plans will be tracked in order to aidin effective management of the recovery program. NOAA Fisheries believes that periodic review and updating of plans andtracking of recovery efforts are important elements of a successful recoveryprogram. Information from tracking and implementing recovery actions andother sources will be used to review plans and revise them as necessary.These and other elements of NOAA's recovery planning process will be discussedin more detail in the draft Recovery Planning Guidelines that the agencyis developing. Classification The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the SmallBusiness Administration that these draft guidelines, if adopted, wouldnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities because they do not direct or mandate decisions on a species'listing, reclassification or delisting. Rather, they set up prioritiesfor later decisions as to agency review of species, recovery plan developmentand recovery task implementation. As a result, a regulatory flexibilityanalysis was not prepared.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 23, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Andrew J.
