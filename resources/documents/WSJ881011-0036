The move is part of a 4.3 billion-franc bailout plan designed to refloat the Paris-based bank, which incurred losses totalling 2.1 billion francs and was in danger of bankruptcy.    The rescue plan also calls for Al Saudi's creditors to make a total of 2.7 billion francs in fresh interest-free loans to the bank, the officials said. In both cases, the loans will be frozen for four years and three months.    Banking sources said individual banks' contributions will be keyed to the size of their deposits.    The rescue operation has provoked protest from some bankers who feel they are being obliged to put up funds so that foreign investors can recover their loans.    Meanwhile, Thomson S.A. confirmed Thomson-CSF Finance, financial unit of the state-owned industrial group's electronics and weapons division, will acquire Al Saudi Banque for a symbolic franc. Thomson, which has won several major arms contracts in the Middle East, is owed 400 million francs by Al Saudi and is one of the bank's biggest creditors. </TEXT></DOC>
