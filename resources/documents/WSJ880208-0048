West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a pivotal figure in future European security decisions, seemed to back away from a Western alliance commitment to modernize the short-range nuclear weapons that will remain in Europe after the superpower treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe is ratified. Mr. Kohl told the annual Wehrkunde seminar, attended by military analysts, legislators and government officials from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, that modernizing or upgrading the short-range missiles should somehow be linked to new superpower negotiations on reducing their numbers. His position seemed to put him at odds not only with the U.S. but with Britain and France as well, all of which favor a pause in talks about further nuclear disarmament in Europe in order to focus on righting the imbalance in conventional military forces there.    The Reagan administration, in supporting the INF treaty, has banked heavily on upgrading the remaining missiles as a main element of the future defense of Western Europe against superior Warsaw Pact conventional forces.    Mr. Kohl gave the fullest explanation to date of Germany's position on the increasingly controversial issue of what to do with the short-range nuclear weapons. While he said he rejects denuclearization of Europe, his insistence on linking modernization with negotiations may in effect lead to eliminating them. While a denuclearized Europe may sound safer, the whole purpose of nuclear weapons in Europe has been to offset Soviet conventional superiority.    All this prompted Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, to warn the conference that the proposed INF treaty and subsequent disarmament moves could split and then neutralize the Western alliance. U.S. missiles slated for destruction under the pact, which is all but certain to be ratified by the Senate, can reach Soviet targets in minutes and are among the most feared elements of the Western arsenal.    To offset the strategic setback their removal will cause, Sen. Nunn, who is considered by Europeans to be a &quot;shadow secretary of defense,&quot; called for the modernization of the remaining short-range nuclear systems, the improvement of conventional defenses in Europe, and a bold negotiating strategy to shrink the Warsaw Pact's advantages in conventional arms.    None of the three is happening. Aside from Mr. Kohl's stance, Hans-Jochen Vogel, chairman of West Germany's Social Democratic Party, opposes the modernization plan outright, and West Germans from both parties say there is little public support for bringing in another generation of nuclear systems.    Sen. Nunn's call for &quot;revolutionary improvements&quot; in conventional arms seems equally unlikely. In Washington, Pentagon planners are dropping new weapons projects to meet demands for budget savings. European arms budgets are similarly constrained. Negotiations with the Soviets over possible reductions in coventional arms are moving at a glacial pace. Neither the Reagan administration nor NATO has advanced a detailed proposal. State Department officials say the U.S. wants to link the conventional arms talks to Soviet human-rights concessions, an approach that portends protracted talks.    In any case, West Germany's reluctance to modernize nuclear weapons raises the possiblity that Western Europe might eventually be stripped of effective nuclear defenses. &quot;Denuclearization would leave the Western alliance without any plausible defense,&quot; said Richard Perle, former assistant secretary of defense. Without modernized short-range weapons, he added, &quot;I don't know how we could in good conscience leave 325,000 American troops in Europe hopelessly unprotected.&quot;    Moreover, U.S. officials contend it would be impossible to verify Soviet compliance with any future treaty of the sort some West Germans are seeking to reduce short-range nuclear systems. These are often small and identical to conventional shells and missiles that wouldn't be affected, the officials point out.    The adjustment of the Western military posture in Europe will be the focus of a NATO summit schedule in March. However, changes brought on by the INF treaty are likely to continue to play out in complicated ways. Said Andre Giraud, the French defense minister: &quot;It is as if we're facing a house of cards that we have to rearrange without collapsing the original structure.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
