Butthat would jump to 15% after the acquisition of the Rockwellunit, which supplies products for telephone communicationsnetworks, including fiber optic transmission systems,microwave transmission systems, digital multiplex productsand digital cross-connect systems.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Certainly, with this acquisition Alcatel is demonstratingits great commitment to be in the U.S., and it's probably thelast chance Alcatel will have to be a big player in theU.S.,&quot; said Achmad Chadran, research manager for NorthernBusiness Information, a division of Datapro Research Group inNew York.   With the market for large computerized switching systemsused by phone companies in the doldrums, analysts say thefiber-optic transmission equipment market will be the majorbattlefield for big equipment manufacturers such as AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co., Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada,and NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan.   The most intense fighting will center on a group offiber-optic products built to a new industry standard calledSonet, or Synchronous Optical Network. Developed by BellCommunications Research, the laboratory owned by the sevenregional Bell companies, and overseas telecommunicationsauthorities, Sonet was created to expand the base oftransmission equipment suppliers. Phone companies also wantto use Sonet equipment to improve maintenance and expelinefficient systems that require additional gear to help themcommunicate.   Although still relatively small, Sonet business isexpected to skyrocket as phone companies accelerate theirinstallation plans. Northern Business Information/Dataproexpects the Sonet market to hit $250 million by 1994 and $1billion by 1997. After 2000, things could really take off asthe phone companies transform all of their lines to Sonettransmission.   Alcatel has positioned itself well in the U.S., being oneof the first companies to deliver Sonet gear and landcontracts from at least three Baby Bells-Bell Atlantic Corp.,U S West and Ameritech, said Anant Das, telecommunicationsequipment analyst at Dataquest Inc., San Jose, Calif.   &quot;With Rockwell, Alcatel gets a jump in the market bygetting a good U.S. distribution channel and marketingorganization,&quot; said Mr. Das. &quot;And {Alcatel} is pre-emptingEricsson {of Sweden} and {Germany's} Siemens from getting aposition in the U.S. Sonet market. Both are weak in thisarea.&quot;   Indeed, after acquiring Rockwell's Network TransmissionSystems, Alcatel will have about 23% of the $7.5 billion U.S.market for fiber-optic transmission equipment. While that'sstill far less than ATandamp;T's 44%, it is well ahead of NorthernTelecom's 7%.   Rockwell put Network Transmission Systems on the block inApril because it felt the unit didn't offer a full enoughline of telephone communications products to competeeffectively on its own, and because it would have requiredheavy capital investments to stay ahead of the competition.The division, based in Richardson, Texas, has about 3,600employees and accounted for $439 million of Rockwell's $12.4billion sales in fiscal 1990.   Rockwell, which has interests in electronics, aerospace,automotive and graphics businesses, said it expects the saleto close by Sept. 30, assuming timely completion ofregulatory reviews. The purchase price of $625 millionexcludes certain liabilities, which Alcatel has agreed toassume.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          FIBER-OPTIC TRANSMISSION systems have an annual U.S.market of about $1.09 billion. The size was overstated inMonday's edition because of an incorrect figure provided byan analyst.   (WSJ July 17, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
