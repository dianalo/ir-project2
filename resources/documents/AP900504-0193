HELENS, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ten years. Time enough for aforest to spring from lifeless ash. Time enough for people in theshadow of a restless volcano to recover, even profit, fromcatastrophe.   But never time enough to forget.   Even as nature heals this shattered mountain with a blanket ofgreen, the violence of May 18, 1980, remains seared in memory. Thatwas the day Mount St. Helens exploded, killing 57 people,flattening a forest and spitting out an ash cloud that circled theglobe.   Don McElwain remembers. He was camping 20 miles away when hotash engulfed him, turning his day to night.   ``I'm a former Army Ranger and not much scares me,'' he said.``But I'll tell you, I was doing some praying.''   McElwain and two camping partners barely escaped on horseback,breathing through rags torn from their shirts as they rode acrossash that singed the hair on the horses' legs.   But the ordeal did not destroy his love of Mount St. Helens.Like many of the volcano's neighbors, McElwain, 53, hopes to profitfrom a disaster that changed this region's economic life as surelyas it rearranged the landscape. He's been scouting out land,thinking of starting up a small tourist resort.   ``Someday,'' he said, ``this place will be beautiful again.''   Before it erupted, Mount St. Helens was a snowy, symmetrical,seemingly dormant volcano surrounded by tall evergreen forests.Thousands of campers experienced their first real wilderness alongcrystal-clear Spirit Lake, on the mountain's north side.   The idyll couldn't last. Mount St. Helens, historically one ofthe Cascade Range's most active volcanoes, had not erupted since1857. Geologists warned it was overdue.   At 8:32 a.m. on May 18, 1980, after weeks of sputtering andrumbling, the volcano roared awake. An earthquake jarred loose ahuge slab that slid into the lake, weakening the mountain's northside.   Magma that for months had risen slowly up the volcano's ventssuddenly let loose in a sideways explosion of gas, rock and ash2,500 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that destroyedHiroshima.   A super-heated cloud of pulverized rock, focused horizontally bythe misshapen crater, flattened 150-foot-tall fir trees like piecesof straw. Across Spirit Lake, a mammoth wave caused by thelandslide sloshed over the opposite ridge, washing the slopes bareof the downed timber.   Victims caught in the blast included U.S. Geological Surveyscientist David Johnston, killed even as he monitored delicatemeasuring devices on a ridge 5 miles away. Photographer ReidBlackburn snapped a few pictures, then retreated to his car. He wasfound two days later, smothered by ash.   Harry Truman, who had lived on the mountain 54 years, defiedorders to leave his Spirit Lake lodge, declaring, ``That mountainis a part of Truman, and I'm a part of it.''   His words were prophetic. Truman and his lodge were buried under120 feet of debris and 180 feet of the new, deeper Spirit Lake, asteaming cauldron of mud and water covered by a floating layer ofuprooted trees scoured of bark.   The volcano's heat melted glaciers and starting surgingmudflows. One wall of mud 12 feet high swept down the Toutle River,destroying trucks, bridges and more than 200 homes.   An ash plume rose 14 miles into the air and drifted eastward,darkening three states and choking towns with ashfalls up to 6inches deep.   To observers first returning to the mountain, the destructionseemed complete. But as weeks went by, scientists watched inamazement as life appeared amid the ruin.   Pocket gophers burrowed up from their tunnels, poking theirheads through ash. Colonies of ants went busily about theirbusiness. Even the most barren areas were soon invaded byballooning spiders and beetles, scavengers that floated in onparachute-like webs and survived on the remains of other insectsblown their way.   The first summer, green shoots of fireweed and huckleberry rosethrough 10-inch layers of ash. Later, elk and deer wandered back,and the windblown seeds of alders and evergreens sprouted infertile patches where water and wind had eroded the ash.   Inside the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, a110,000-acre preserve created in 1982 for watching naturalregeneration, the pioneering evergreens now are 4 to 6 inches tall.Outside the monument, the U.S. Forest Service and logging companiesgave nature a jump start, salvaging downed trees and plantingseedlings in holes bored through ash. Today, some of those treesstand 25 feet tall.   As nature heals, so do people. After the eruption, communitiesstill grieving for victims started crawling out and slowly cleaningup.   Fearing more floods, the Army Corps of Engineers dredged rivers,built levees and bored a drainage tunnel to Spirit Lake. This May19, officials will dedicate a sediment retention dam on the ToutleRiver, finishing a decade of recovery work costing more than $560million.   Muddy rivers have grown clearer, and many residents now look toSt. Helens in hope, not fear. They're staking their futures on theflood of tourists coming to see the only active volcano in thecontiguous United States.   More than a million visitors each year drive to viewpoints orstop at a Forest Service visitor center 30 miles from the volcano.Almost 50,000 have climbed the volcano's south side since entryrestrictions were eased in 1987.   Roadside gift shops specialize in volcano souvenirs, and theonce-flooded town of Toutle sponsors an annual Volcano DazeFestival. Developers are preparing for 1992, when a highway will beextended to a new visitor's center peering into the volcano'scrater.   On sunny spring weekends, the mountain's southern flank becomesa playground for up to 400 climbers and skiers. There are higherNorthwest mountains for climbing, more accessible mountains forskiing. But Mount St. Helens, its former 9,677-foot summit reduced1,300 feet by the eruption, has a magnetic appeal.   ``I think it's a morbid curiosity,'' said Martha Miller, peeringinto the barren crater from the rim after a grueling, six-hourclimb on skis.   ``It's the mystique,'' said her husband, Ben, who skied thevolcano partly to impress friends back home in New Hampshire, wherethe mountains are more sedate. ``St. Helens is an an activevolcano, and everyone's heard of it.''   Ten years is a blink of an eye in geologic time, and the volcanostill sputters. The latest steam release occurred April 25.   Scientists don't rule out more fireworks but say the possibilityof an eruption is low. A 920-foot lava dome on the crater floor hasnot grown since 1986, and geologists, who have honed theirpredictive skills since 1980, are confident they can give days orweeks notice of significant eruptions.   That's scant reassurance at the volcano rim, where themountain's jagged wounds are still raw, its destructive power stilloverwhelming. Silent fields of snow and towers of rock dwarfed theskiers as they stared into the immense crater.   Ten years later, Mount St. Helens still commands respect.   ``It makes you feel pretty small,'' Martha Miller said. Sheturned her back to a chill wind blowing up from the crater, and theskiers headed down to the springtime warmth of the forest, farbelow.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   David Foster is the AP Northwest regionalreporter, based in Seattle.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 13</NOTE></DOC>
