The light source, which will be known as Type HB2, is a modificationof the European bulb known as the H-4. The final rule follows a noticeof proposed rulemaking issued in May 1985, and a supplemental notice publishedin June 1986. This final rule adopts more stringent bulb filament and bulb/socket fittolerances than those permitted on the H-4, but allows a \1/4\ degree reaimprovision in the photometric test. Headlamps equipped with Type HB2 lightsources are required to meet the same photometric requirements as TypeF sealed beam headlamps. The final rule does not allow ``European Headlamps'' nor does it allowthe European (ECE) H-4 bulb to be used in passenger cars, multipurposepassenger vehicles, trucks, or buses. The effect of the rule is only topermit the HB2 light source in headlamps designed to meet rigorous environmentaltests imposed by Standard No. 108 for all replaceable bulb headlamps intendedfor sale in the U.S. The HB2 bulb is an improved, tighter-toleranced version,of the H-4 bulb, and it is designed to be used in mechanically aimableheadlamps. The HB2 bulb has to be marked ``D.O.T.'' to certify compliancewith these requirements. The H-4 bulb may not legally be so marked. Because their headllamps are not required to be mechanically aimable, motorcyclesmay use an H-4 bulb, however, under the final rule, the lenses of theseheadlamps are required to be marked ``Motorcycle'', and they may not beused in other motor vehicles.

(``Sylvania''). This headlamp differedfrom those previously permitted in that it was not an indivisible unit,but one consisting of two parts, a lens-reflector assembly bonded together,and a standardized light source that could be replaced in the event ofburn-out. The agency granted the petition, and proposed adoption of theFord/Sylvania light source on January 17, 1983 (48 FR 1992). NHTSA amendedthe standard on June 2, 1983, to allow headlamps with the Ford/Sylvanialight source (48 FR 24690). Subsequently, Volkswagen of America petitioned NHTSA for rulemaking toallow the H-4. Although the H-4 has always been allowed under StandardNo. 108 for motorcycle usage because mechanically aimable headlamps werenot required for this type of motor vehicle, it had not been allowed forother motor vehicles which were required to have such headlamps. This petitionwas granted in part. On May 13, 1985, the agency proposed the adoptionnot of the H-4, but of a modified version of that light source called theHB2 (50 FR 19961). At the same time, the agency also proposed allowingtwo additional light sources for which General Motors Corporation (``GM'')had petitioned. The May 1985 proposal highlighted significant differences between the EuropeanH-4 and the proposed Type HB2. First, a headlamp with a Type HB2 lightsource would be required to meet the photometrics of Motor Vehicle SafetyStandard No. 198 rather than those of the European regulation. Second,because no life requirement was prescribed by the European standard, NHTSAproposed the HB2 be designed to meet the same average life requirementsas the Ford/Sylvania HB1, 320 hours for the lower beam and 150 hours forthe upper beam, at 14 volts. Third, because no durability requirementswere prescribed by the European standard, NHTSA proposed that headlampswhich use the HB2, meet the same environmental test requirements as headlampswhich use the HB1. NHTSA also observed that some special interface between the bulb and socketwas needed to distinguish between lamp systems presently using the existingH-4 bulb and those that would use the proposed HB2 bulb. In the agency'sview, these modifications would help prevent inadvertent use of light sourceand lamp assemblies that may be available and legal for single headlampmotorcycle use under standard No. 108, but which do not meet all specificationsset forth for multiple headlamp passenger cars. To assure the capabilityof mechanical aim, tighter specifications and tolerances for fit betweenthe HB2 light source and the headlamp socket and for filament positionwith respect to the base were proposed which were comparable to those alreadyrequired for the Ford/Sylvania HB1. This was intended to help reduce theproblems associated with mechanical aiming that would exist if the Europeanspecifications were used. Mechanical aim is not required on ECE headlampsand the tolerances on bulb-socket fit and filament location are not adequateto assure mechanical aim capability for headlamps using the H-4 bulb. The principal commenters on the proposed HB2 were six manufacturers oflighting equipment: Sylvania, General Electric Corp. (``GE''), OSRAM, Hella,Thorn, and North American Philips Co. (``Philips''). Nine vehicle manufacturersalso commented: Volkswagen, Rolls-Royce, GM, AMC, Chrysler, Fiat, MercedesBenz, BMW, and Ford. Although use of the existing H-4 was oposed by Sylvania,GE, and Ford, the majority of the commenters supported the May 1985 proposalbut urged modifications in it. On May 2, 1986, NHTSA amended Standard No. 108 to allow the two GM lightsources (51 FR 16235) set forth in the May 1985 proposal. At that time,the agency adopted its 1985 proposal to designate the Ford/Sylvania lightsource as Type HB1, and the GM sources as Types HB3 and HB4. Final actionwas not taken in that notice on Type HB2. Instead of proceeding directlyto a final rule, the agency issued a supplementary proposal regarding TypeHB2 on June 13, 1986 (51 FR 21696), to consider the modifications urgedby the commenters on the May 1985 proposal. The June 1986 proposal statedthat issues relating to the other aspects of the May 1985 proposal wouldbe addressed in the next rulemaking action. <ITAG tagnum="84">Technical Issues of the May 1985 and June 1986 Proposals </ITAG>The June 1986 proposal addressed four major issues. 1. Design of the Base of the HB2 The May 1985 notice proposed that there be a difference in physical appearanceand type of fit between the bases of the HB2 and H-4 light sources in orderto minimize the potential misuse of bulbs that had higher-than-permittedlight output, broader tolerances, etc. Virtually all of the 12 commenterson this issue objected on the ground that it would result in increasedmanufacturing costs and probably not have the desired effect as illegalversions of the HB2 lacking the different base could easily be developed.The June 1986 notice therefore proposed that the HB2 use the IEC P43t-38base found on existing H-4 bulbs but with tighter fit tolerances. As anadditional aid to proper use of replaceable lighting sources, that proposalalso proposed that bulbs and lenses of motorcycle headlamps be labeled``motorcycle'' if the replaceable light source were other than the HB series(e.g., an unmodified H-4). 2. Tolerances on the Fit Between the Base and Socket of the HB2 In response to the May 1985 proposal, GE, OSRAM, Hella, Philips, Volkswagen,GM, and Rolls-Royce supported use of the existing H-4 but with reducedfilament, filament-to-shield, and filament location tolerances, as wellas new socket fit specifications. OSRAM suggested additional changes toassure that beam pattern and aim requirements would be met after bulb replacementwhen using mechanical aiming. Thorn recommended changes in dimensions andtolerances to improve manufacturability. OSRAM and Volkswagen suggestednew ECE references for referral to the H-4 bulb and socket. In response,the June 1986 notice proposed reductions in tolerances on reflector cavitydimensions, and the angle locating the two lower sockets for referencelugs. HB2 cap tolerance reductions were also proposed. Other changes werealso proposed to ensure a tighter bulb-socket fit to assure correct aimwith any HB2 bulb in a mechanically aimed headlamp. 3. Tolerances on the Location of HB2 Filaments The consensus of the commenters on the May 1985 proposal was that the proposedtolerances on the location of the HB2 filaments were not sufficiently smallto assure proper aim after bulb replacement. Accordingly, the June 1986notice proposed reduced bulb filament tolerances suggested by OSRAM andPhilips, and bulb/socket fit tolerances revised from those of the May 1985proposal. The June 1986 notice also proposed elimination of the \1/4\ degree reaimallowance on each test point during photometric testing, a proposal notincluded in the May 1985 notice. Such an allowance had been permitted heretoforeto compensate for variations in the accuracy of laboratory equipment andto ensure a greater degree of repeatability when headlamps are tested bydifferent laboratories. However, data submitted by VW on prototype headlampsusing the H-4 bulb, indicated that the H-4 can produce a high gradientphotometric pattern, with the result that a shift of \1/4\ degree can produceup to a 5000 candela change in intensity. This would allow the intensityat a test point such as \1/2\D-1\1/2\R to be as low as 3000 candela comparedwith the 8000 candela minimum required by Standard No. 108. Such a disparitydoes not exist in the lower gradient beam patterns produced by most headlampsheretofore designed to meet Standard No. 108. The proposed reduced filamenttolerances were intended as a complement because NHTSA concluded that HB2replacement bulbs covering the full range of permissible H-4 European tolerancescould not meet photometric requirements when the reaim allowance was eliminated.4. Bulb Rating, Performance Requirements NHTSA originally proposed that maximum power and luminous flux be measuredat 13.2 volts, but in response to a comment by GM, the June 1986 proposalsubstituted 12.8 design volts. It was also proposed that the design luminousflux be changed from 1000 to 910 lumens on the lower beam and from 1650to 1500 lumens on the upper beam (with tolerances of 10 percent for each),when measured at the lower design voltage. Finally, the June 1986 notice proposed deleting the note in the EuropeanH-4 drawings which allows obscuration of light output from the bulb bymeans other than a black cap. <ITAG tagnum="84">Type HB2 as Adopted </ITAG>Therefore, on the basis of the proposals in the May 1985 and June 1986notices, and available information, including the comments submitted inresponse to these notices, NHTSA is amending Federal Motor Vehicle SafetyStandard No. 108 to allow the HB2 replaceable light source with the followingcharacteristics: 1. Photometrics In the May 1985 proposal, NHTSA asked for comments on alternative proposals,that a headlamp with a Type HB2 light source meet photometrics requiredfor Type F sealed beam headlamps, or that it meet the requirements forheadlamps designed to conform to SAE Standard J579c. In response to theMay 1985 proposal, Volkswagen, as petitioner, commented that it had nopreference. However, it recommended that NHTSA remove the 20,000 candelamaximum at the seeing distance point \1/2\D, 1\1/2\R to R, to take fulladvantage of H-4 capabilities. NHTSA will not remove the 20,000 candelalimit at the test point noted above. The possibility of new photometricrequirements is being studied, and VW's recommendation is properly a partof that study. NHTSA has decided that Type HB2 shall meet Type F photometrics. Higherminimum light levels at critical seeing distance points can be achievedwith Type F photometrics. 2. Design of the Base of the HB2 and Fit/Socket Tolerances Volkswagen, Hella, and OSRAM agreed that the dimension of the bulb base,Dimension ``M'', can be tightened to improve mechanical aim, supportingthe agency opinion that eccentricity control of the diameter is essentialfor accurate mechanical aim. The headlamp socket Dimension ``Z'' will alsobe tightened to improve mechanical aim capability. Otherwise, the bulbbase tolerances will remain identical to those specified for the H-4, aswill the headlamp socket dimensions. 3. Tolerances on Filament Locations The tolerances that were proposed in the June 1986 notice have been adopted,with only minor changes. They are more stringent than the ECE standardrequires of the H-4. This restriction is necessary to ensure that a headlampwith any Type HB2 replaceable bulb installed will continue to meet originalequipment photometrics when mechanically aimed. 4. Allowance of Reaim During Photometric Tests Commenters generally did not favor elimination of the \1/4\ degree reaimallowance. The high gradient beam pattern condition can exist even if ashielded filament light source like the HB2 is not used. Thus, the conditioncan exist even if an H-4 type light source is not used. The agency believesthat the gradient issue is a separate one and has decided to defer theissue for consideration in future rulemakings on beam patterns.5. HB2 Performance and RatingsNHTSA proposed a lumen tolerance of 10 percent, as contrasted with an ECEtolerance of 15 percent. Since no commenters opposed this proposal, ithas been adopted. Further, performance will be measured at 12.8 volts aswith other replaceable light sources, and not 13.2 as with ECE ratings.The wattage values have been changed to reflect the test voltage. As withall other replaceable bulbs, a white shield will be used over the rearof the HB2 bulb base during the bulb lumen test. 6. Marking of Motorcycle Headlamps The agency had proposed the marking of motorcycle headlamp lenses and bulbswith the words ``For motorcycle use only'' in characters 4mm high. A newcommenter to the June 1986 proposal, American Honda, objected on the groundsthat H-4 bulbs also have off-road applications in vehicles other than motorcycles.Another commenter, Stanley Electric Co., stated that it already uses theword ``Motorcycle'' in 3mm characters on its headlamps, and therefore didnot agree with the agency's rather different proposal. NHTSA considersthese points well made, and is amending Standard No. 108 to require theword ``Motorcycle'' to appear on the lens, and in characters 3mm high,on motorcycle headlamps equipped with a replaceable bulb other than onespecified in Standard No. 108. No bulb marking will be required. StandardNo. 108 does not require the type of bulb used in motorcycle headlampsto be marked on the lens.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments in Opposition</ITAG>Issues of safety, economic impact, and fairness have been raised by thetwo principal opponents of Type HB2, Sylvania and GE. Sylvania argues that``NHTSA's finding that the H-4 light source meets U.S. safety standardswould effectively lower U.S. standards rather than enhance the safety ofreplaceable light sources''. It bases this conclusion upon the followingconcerns:1. ``Because the H-4 is designed for use in a non-sealed headlamp system,the system is prone to reflector and lens corrosion, reducing light outputto unsafe levels over time.''2. ``The looser `fit' and tolerances of the H-4 increases significantlythe potential for unsafe oncoming driver glare.'' 3. ``The H-4 lamp, which incorporates an internal light-absorbing shieldover the low beam filament, provides less on-the-road light for the drivercompared to the HB1.''4. ``The shield in the H-4 reflects more light upwards in front of thedriver, resulting in excessive glare when driving in snow or fog.''5. ``Headlamps that are equipped with H-4 bulbs may not provide adequatelight for visibility of overhead interstate highway signs that are notartificially lighted.''6. ``As the H-4 is currently available in wattages higher than the petitionpermits (e.g., 100W vs. 65W high beam), there is potential that oncomingdrivers can experience disabling glare coming from these higher wattagebulbs. There is no provision in the proposed rules for making such bulbsnoninterchangeable.''NHTSA agrees that the H-4 is designed for use in a non-sealed headlampsystem, and that, in the absence of environmental testing designed to addressthe problem, non-sealed systems can be prone to reflector and lens corrosion,which over time will reduce light output. One of the agency's primary andlong-standing concerns about non-sealed beam headlamps was the marginalresistance to corrosion of the reflectors, as noted in the German TUV inspectionreports, and Swedish ``Weak Points of Motor Vehicles'', among other sources.This was one of the reasons that the agency in the late 1970's denied severalpetitions for rulemaking to allow European headlamps. Accordingly, whenNHTSA amended Standard No. 108 to allow a headlamp that was not a sealedbeam (incorporating the HB1 light source), it adopted stringent environmentaltests including a 240-hour salt spray test to demonstrate corrosion resistance.Volkswagen, in fact, petitioned NHTSA to reduce the length of this test,and its petition was denied. Because all replaceable bulb headlamps mustmeet this corrosion performance test, NHTSA believes it consistent withthe intent of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act to leavethe design solution (i.e., seal or no seal) to the manufacturer. The petitioner for the HB1 included a seal in its design. Originally, thepetitioner for the HB3 and HB4 submitted drawings in which a seal was lacking;however, subsequently it revised its design to include a seal because itappeared to provide a better control of the positioning of the filament,and the HB3 and HB4 as adopted contain a sealing feature. Because all replaceablebulb headlamps must meet identical environmental performance requirements,NHTSA does not agree that all future replaceable bulbs must also have aseal. The sealing issue was the basis of an argument by Sylvania that the June1986 notice was ambiguous and hence procedurally deficient. The Summaryto that notice stated that it would cover only bulb and socket dimensions,and bulb rating and performance, and that ``other HB2 issues will be addressedin the next rulemaking action''. According to its comment, NHTSA's statementcould mean either that the matter is deferred or that the agency had nothingfurther to add to its May 1985 notice. Sylvania believes that ``it seemsplain that some reasonable laymen could have reserved comment on sealingunder the belief that the matter had been deferred. Such ambiguity rendersthe notice legally defective.'' Sylvania cites NHTSA's actions in proposingno-seal designs for HB2, HB3 and HB4 in May 1985, and subsequently adoptingseal designs for HB3 and HB4 shortly before the June 1986 notice appeared.Comments Sylvania: ``(The June 1986 notice) *** was silent on how the newsafety rationale of venting-plus-sealing should apply to the HB2. Likethe HB3 and HB4, the HB2 is designed for use in vented assemblies *** IfNHTSA has grounds to believe that safety requires seals for the ventedHB3 and HB4 lamps but not for the vented HB2 lamp, it should expose thosereasons to public scrutiny and comment.'' NHTSA finds Sylvania's position without legal merit, and has concludedthat the spirit and the letter of the Administrative Procedure Act havebeen met by the rulemaking history of HB2, and HB3 and HB4. The May 1985notice provided an opportunity to comment on the subject matter therein,including the fact that, unlike the HB1, the proposed additional lightsources did not incorporate seals. Because the notice adopting the modifiedHB3 and HB4 light sources appeared in advance of the supplemental proposalon HB2, the June 1986 notice provided a further opportunity for commenton the sealing issue, even if that issue was not directly addressed. Thoseaspects of the May 1985 proposal that were not addressed in June 1986 remainedin effect and were not suspended pending ``the next rulemaking action,''whether that action was an amendment or a further proposal. As to Sylvania's second concern about the H-4, NHTSA also agrees that thelooser ``fit'' and tolerances of H-4 are undesirable, and that is why theyhave been tightened on Type HB2. With regard to Sylvania's arguments thatthe H-4 bulb would provide less light on the road and be more prone toglare problems because of its internal shield, again NHTSA has proposedthe same photometric performance specifications for the HB2 bulb as existfor other conforming headlamps. As long as the headlamp is made to complywith these performance requirements, its internal design features are notat issue. Because the shield may restrict the upper portion of the beam, Sylvaniabelieves that visibility of overhead signs will be impeded. It is truethat a shield can restrict a bulb's upper directed light, however homofocalreflector designs or lensing can compensate for it by directing the bulb'sunshielded light upward.There is no way that NHTSA can prevent deliberate substitution by an ownerof an H-4 bulb for an HB2, but the tighter bulb-socket fit tolerances willensure that not all H-4s will be interchangeable with Type HB2.Another concern expressed by Sylvania is that of energy efficiency. BothSylvania and GE argue that inefficiency results with a 55 watt lower beamand use of the internal shield. The agency acknowledges these remarks,but believes that they do not bear on the question of whether HB2 shouldbe permitted, since they relate to efficiency of operation and not to motorvehicle safety. The agency notes, for example, that Sylvania's own HB1requires a high profile reflector. Since 1981, NHTSA's policy has beento try to remove restrictions barring the entry in the marketplace of productsof comparative safety performance; Sylvania was one of the first beneficiariesof this policy. No manufacturer is required to adopt HB2. Since its useis optional, potential users in the marketplace will decide the importanceof the energy issues raised by the commenters.Some commenters strongly opposed the rulemaking on economic grounds, citingalleged competitive disadvantages. While, as discussed below, NHTSA concludesthat the record in any event does not support those commenters' allegations,the agency has also considered how such arguments should be viewed in lightof the statutory criteria for establishing standards. Section 103 of theNational Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act requires that each Federalmotor vehicle safety standard must be practicable, meet the need for motorvehicle safety, and be stated in objective terms.Since there is no statutory definition of ``practicable,'' this agencyfollows the example of the courts and other agencies under other statutesof using the dictionary to interpret the term. The dictionary defines ``practicable''as ``capable of being done, effected, or put into practice, with the availablemeans; feasible.'' <T3>Random House Dictionary of the English Language, </T3>unabridged edition.Thus, the requirement that a standard be practicable means that a standardmust be ``capable of being done,'' i.e., capable of being complied with.Court decisions indicate that a number of economic factors are comprehendedby the term ``practicable,'' including economic hardship of compliance.For example, in <T3>H andamp; H Tire Co. </T3>v. <T3>Department of Transportation, </T3>471 F.2d 350 (7th Cir. 1972), thecourt concluded that NHTSA, in establishing a standard for retreaded tires,must consider the deleterious economic impact that the retreaded tire industrywould experience if it had to comply with the standard. Where the additionof a compliance option is at issue, however, alleged economic hardshipis not related to whether compliance with the standard is capable of beingdone, since no manufacturer is required to choose the new option. Instead,what is alleged to be economic hardship is simply the result of competitionin the marketplace by various manufacturers making different choices amongthe available compliance options.As indicated above, NHTSA has striven since 1981 to remove restrictionsbarring the entry into the marketplace of products of comparative safetyperformance. This policy has been pursued evenhandedly, and a number ofcompanies, as well as the public as a whole, have been its beneficiaries.While NHTSA recognizes that the statutory criterion of practicability requiresit to consider economic factors, it rejects any notion that Congress intendedthat the Safety Act be used to prohibit or inhibit technological alternativesin order to favor existing products and companies. To the contrary, Congressspecified that safety standards be expressed in terms of performance ratherthan design because it did not want the standards to ``stifle innovationin automobile design.'' See S. Rep. No. 1301, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966).Further, the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 admonishes Federal regulatoryagencies not to establish or retain standards that act as non-tariff tradebarriers by excluding products on grounds unrelated to the purposes ofthose standards.NHTSA believes that the case of <T3>Chrysler </T3>v. <T3>Department of Transportation, </T3>515 F.2d 1053 (6th Cir. 1975), supportsits view of practicability, with respect to optional provisions in safetystandards. In that case, Chrysler sought review of a lighting standardamendment which permitted the use of rectangular headlamps for a specifiedperiod of time, during which the agency would decide whether to permitsuch headlamps permanently. The company stated that it would be unableto take advantage of the option because it could not complete the necessaryengineering and retooling in time to produce automobiles equipped withthe new headlamps before the option expired, and that the earlier terminationdate was therefore impracticable. The court stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">We have some doubt that practicability is a significant principlein the context of an optional provision in a safety standard. A reviewof the cases in this area suggests the practicability requirement was designedprimarily to prevent the NHTSA from establishing mandatory safety standardsthat are economically or technologically infeasible * * *. In the caseat bar, however, the use of rectangular headlamps is not required, andChrysler is subject to none of the statutory penalties if it fails to complywith this aspect of Standard No. 108.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Even assuming that the practicability requirement is fully applicablein this situation, it would be difficult to conclude that the rectangularheadlamp option is impracticable in any absolute sense. The record revealsthat at least two manufacturers are presently capable of producing rectangularheadlamps. It may be that lead-time problems will make it difficult orimpossible for Chrysler to take advantage of the new headlamp option, butwe decline to construe the practicability requirement to invalidate a permissivesafety standard merely because all manufacturers do not derive benefitsfrom it. (515 F.2d at 1060.)</ITAG>The agency notes that Chrysler also argued that the time limitation wouldconfer a competitive advantage upon General Motors, thereby violating boththe reasonableness standard of the Safety Act and the ``arbitrary and capricious''standard of the Administrative Procedure Act. The court stated that itwas not unsympathetic to this predicament, but also stated that the earlyeffective date seemed more justifiable since any delay would be at theexpense of the manufacturer which had invested time and money to incorporatenew headlamps and taken the risk that NHTSA might reject its proposal.(See 515 F.2d at 1060.)In the current factual situation, NHTSA has already permitted opponents'new headlamps. For example, in the rulemaking to permit headlamps withthe Ford/Sylvania light source, Sylvania requested (through its co-developer'spetition) and received the benefits from the very type of rulemaking itnow opposes. Now, as discussed below, Sylvania asserts that this rulemakingis unfair to it, since it has invested substantial money to manufactureits product. NHTSA, however, sees nothing fair in permitting one manufacturer'snew product and then declining to permit another manufacturer's competingproduct of comparative safety performance, simply to confer a competitiveadvantage on the first manufacturer.  The economic impact issue raised by the opponents is essentially one ofcompetitiveness. HB2's principal opponents are manufacturers of the HB1,which for three years was the only type of standardized replaceable lightsource permitted by standard No. 108. NHTSA believes the following summarizesSylvania's position on trade and U.S. employment implications if the HB2were approved:  1. Because the HB2 is less complex than the HB1, it is ``less costly tomanufacture.''  2. With substantial foreign lighting and automobile manufacturer experiencewith the H-4, relatively easy convertibility to the HB2, and lower cost,the HB2 bulb would then become the ``de facto world standard.''  3. There are no domestic producers of the H4 or HB2. There are a numberof foreign manufacturers of the H4. As there is excess capacity of H4 productionworldwide, these manufacturers would have ``unfettered access to the U.S.market.''  4. Asian and European automobile manufacturers would switch to the H4 lightsource in automobiles targeted for the U.S. market. Thus, approval of theH4 light source would immediately deprive U.S. manufacturers of millionsof dollars of export sales and, while the American automobile manufacturersindicated they would not switch to the H4 immediately because of the investmentin current tooling, they would likely switch in the future when new carsare designed for the world market.5. Auto companies ``want to deal only with automotive lighting manufacturerswho can provide them with a full line of products.'' Thus, if Sylvaniaand other U.S. manufacturers ``are driven out of the replaceable lightsource business, it will put them in an untenable position with respectto other automotive lighting products.''  6. The end result of the above could be ``no U.S. manufacturers left inthe U.S. automotive lighting business.'' ``If U.S. manufacturers are unableto compete in the automotive lighting business, as many as 15,000 U.S.jobs could be lost.''  In amplification, Sylvania has commented that because the HB2 does notincorporate an ``O'' ring and a base of high temperature plastic, manufacturingcosts will be less, and manufacturers of motor vehicles will shift to theHB2. Accordingly, Sylvania predicts that it and GE will lose not only theoriginal equipment market, but also the associated replacement market thatwould have accrued to those headlamps. Sylvania predicted that adoptionof HB2 ``could lead to the eventual demise of the U.S. domestic headlampindustry.''  The agency has carefully considered the remarks of the commenters. It istrue that there is a difference in design and materials among the HB seriesof replaceable light sources. This is because NHTSA has sought to respondin a positive manner to the particular, differing designs of the petitionersfor these sources. Both the Sylvania/Ford (HB1) and GM (HB3 and HB4) designsincorporated ``O'' rings, Ford/Sylvania's to provide a semi-deal for non-ventedheadlamps, and GM's as an aid to correctly seating the bulb in the lamp.On the other hand, Volkswagen's petition for the adoption of the H-4 didnot include an ``O'' ring as a feature of the design. Although one designmay differ from another, all replaceable bulb headlamps must meet the sameenvironmental performance test requirements.  NHTSA is cognizant of the commenter's argument that allowance of the HB2``would result in the H-4 becoming the de facto world standard,'' but thetruth of the matter is that the H-4 appears already to be acceptable inevery country of the world except the United States.  The opponents did not submit any comparative cost figures. The agency concludedthat the HB2 could initially cost vehicle manufacturers about $0.15 to$0.60 less than the HB1, primarily because manufacturers of the HB2 haveover 20 years of experience in producing a similar bulb (the H-4) and inmany cases, their facility costs have been amortized. However, GE, a U.S.light source manufacturer, believes that the HB2 and HB1 will eventuallycost the same, as manufacturers of the HB1 convert to highly automatedand efficient production, which they have already begun to do. The agencyalso believes that any competitive advantage the HB2 might have (bulb cost,ease of meeting U.S. and European photometic requirements) would be veryslight, if any, and may be balanced by an advantage for the HB1 in meetingU.S. durability requirements, its energy efficiency, and its more familiarU.S. lower beam pattern.  On the trade issue, the agency believes that adoption of the HB2 will allowdomestic motor vehicles produced for foreign markets to be equipped withthe same light source that require no prior approval before sale. GeneralMotors has argued that NHTSA should adopt the HB2 for trade purposes. Andwhile Sylvania argued that adoption of the HB2 will result in the lossof all U.S. automotive lighting business, it failed to support this allegation,after repeated agency attempts to obtain such documentation. The agency'sown questioning of GM, Ford, and Chrysler, all of whom are Sylvania customers,uncovered little or no interest in the HB2, thus negating Sylvania's claim. This comparison of cost and competitiveness may well be academic becausethe agency also believes that future headlamp designs for both HB1 andHB2 sources will be limited in number. NHTSA believes that, except forcertain European makes retaining traditional vertical or squared grillesand associated buff frontal surfaces, there is an almost universal trendin vehicle design worldwide to aerodynamic low profile front ends, andsmaller lamps with axial filaments are being developed in response to manufacturers'needs for them. The high profile HB1 or HB2 lamps are not as suitable forthese needs as the HB3 or HB4 lamps, or other lighting systems known tobe under development, such as Sylvania's own eight-unit ``multi-beam''system (whose petition for rulemaking is now pending at NHTSA). If thereis a competitive challenge to HB1, it does not come from HB2 in the agency'sview. It comes from the exigencies of future design. For example, Sylvania'slow profile system seems likely to cut into the market for its higher profileHB1. As Sylvania itself has recently said: ``In the increasingly technologicworld of automotive lighting, the only constant is change'' (advertisement,Automotive Engineering, February 1987, p. 161).  Finally, the commenters raise the fairness issue, stated as follows:  1. ``Sylvania and other U.S. manufacturers have invested substantial sumsof money to manufacture a product in accordance with NHTSA's recent 1983rulemaking (HB1 approval). Approval of the H-4 would render obsolete thisinvestment.''      2. ``U.S. manufacturers cannot sell U.S. standard headlamps in most foreignmarkets because of foreign standards.''3. ``Approval of the H-4 would expose U.S. manufacturers to competitionin the U.S. market with no reciprocal trade opportunities made availablein foreign markets.''4. ``The major beneficiaries of the NHTSA proposal would be European andJapanese lighting companies.''As the agency commented above, the investment represented in HB1 toolingmay be rendered obsolete by advancements in lighting technologies ratherthan by competition from a newly-permitted but existing light source, andU.S. lighting manufacturers themselves will be the major contributors tothis normal process of technological changeover. As to the lack of reciprocaltrade opportunities, NHTSA notes that developers of the HB1 had not triedto get permission to market it in Europe. Therefore, on April 22, 1986,NHTSA formally petitioned the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) to amendits relevant regulations to permit the use of the HB1, HB3, and HB4 replaceablelight sources. The proposal was considered at the June 1987 meeting ofWP29 (the Working Party on Construction of Vehicles), and referred to itsMeeting of Experts on Lighting (GRE) for action. The Groupe de Travailde Bruxelles (GTB), an active participant in the GRE, was asked by theGRE to review the request. As of January 1989, that review was not complete,but it is expected that the review of HB3 and HB4 will be completed soon.In the meantime, use of headlamps with HB3 and HB4 light sources has becomelegal in Germany (through exemptions granted individual vehicle lines bythe Senator for the Interior of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen). Withrespect to HB1, a study is underway in GTB to determine if it is feasibleto produce a sharp cut-off beam pattern. NHTSA is an active participantin the work of the GRE, and will continue to pursue the matter aggressivelywithin that group and at WP29. Given the likelihood that HB3 and HB4 willbe approved in the near term, NHTSA declines to accept the commenter'srecommendation that the allowance of HB2 be tabled ``until such time asa worldwide headlamp standard is established under the auspices of theSociety of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and Brussels Working Group (GTB).''After the close of the comment period Sylvania sought to persuade the agencythat allowance of the HB2 would result in a substantial loss of sales.NHTSA asked Sylvania, in an effort to obtain more information, to supportits allegations. Sylvania submitted a document under a claim of confidentiality,which it claimed supported its position. The agency reviewed this informationand concluded that it provided little support. It showed some intereston the part of some unidentified manufacturers to use the European H-4(although not necessarily the HB2). However, Sylvania's submission includedsome manufacturers who are not presently selling vehicles in the UnitedStates. Although repeatedly requested by the agency to do so, as the recordindicates, Sylvania did not disaggregate its data; therefore the agencycould not assess the impact on Sylvania's sales since it did not have thedata to do so. Subsequently, NHTSA independently sought and obtained datafrom several vehicle manufacturers who sell their products in the UnitedStates (including the largest domestic manufacturers). The data, whichis available in the Docket, indicates that the largest manufacturers havelittle interest in and no immediate plans to switch to the Type HB2 inthe event that Standard No. 108 is amended to allow it. Although the precisequantification of Sylvania's market share and its distribution among itscustomers (the vehicle manufacturers) is confidential, the agency is ofthe opinion that, based on the information it obtained, Sylvania's volumeof lighting products will not be substantially affected by allowing theHB2. Sylvania did not submit any actual data to contradict this conclusion.This amendment becomes effective in 30 days. Since the amendment does notimpose any new requirements but instead relieves a restriction, the agencyfinds for good cause shown that an effective date earlier than 180 daysis in the public interest.NHTSA has considered this rule and has determined that it is not majorwithin the meaning of Executive Order 12291 ``Federal Regulation,'' butis significant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies andprocedures. A preliminary regulatory analysis was prepared for the May1985 proposal (Notice 12) and placed in the public docket. For purposesof this final rule, a final regulatory evaluation is being placed in thedocket. Since use of the HB2 replaceable light source is optional, therule will not impose additonal costs or requirements but would permit manufacturersgreater flexibility in the use of headlighting systems.NHTSA has analyzed this rule for the purposes of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act. The rule may have a small, but not significant, positive effectupon the human environment since the weight and quantity of materials usedin the manufacture of headlamps could be reduced.The agency has also considered the impacts of this rule in relation tothe Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify that this rule would not havea significantly economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Accordingly, no initial regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.Manufacturers of motor vehicles and motor vehicle headlamps, those affectedby the rule, are generally not small businesses within the meaning of theRegulatory Flexibility Act. Finally, small organizations and governmentaljurisdictions would not be significantly affected since the price of newvehicles, headlamps, and aimer adjusters will be minimally impacted.Finally, the agency has considered this rule as it relates to ExecutiveOrder 12612 ``Federalism.'' The rule will preempt any State law that differsfrom the rule, but will not preempt any State law that is identical tothe rule, according to the express preemption provision of 15 U.S.C. 1392(d).The engineer and lawyer primarily responsible for this rule are Jere Medlinand Taylor Vinson respectively.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571</ITAG>Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles, Rubber and rubber products,Tires.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 571_[AMENDED]</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR Part 571, andSection; 571.108,Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108, <T3>Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment</T3>, is amendedas follows:1.
