<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-55-0902 </DOCNO><TEXT>The silver-staining procedure for detecting proteins in polyacrylamidegels has been modified so that the polypeptides remain suitable for subsequentradioiodination and tryptic peptide analysis. The procedure, which involvesa silver-staining/destaining protocol that minimizes crosslinking, ismore rapid than many other methods, and can detect as little as 1 ngof protein. Following elimination of silver, the proteins can be radioiodinatedand digested with trypsin by a modification of the method described byJ. H. Elder, R. A. Pickett, J. Hampton, and R. A. Lerner. Together, theseimprovements have increased the sensitivity of the tryptic peptide mappingtechnique by three orders of magnitude and thereby enabled us to performreproducible structural analysis of femtomolar quantities of proteins.</TEXT></DOC>
