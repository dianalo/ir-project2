Evans andamp; Sutherland of Salt Lake City unveiled the ES-1 at itsMountain View, Calif., research facility, touting it as the first``truly'' general purpose supercomputer. It has the equivalent powerof more than 60 IBM 3090 computers, machines at the high end of theIBM line.   Jean-Yves Leclerc, president of the company's computer division,said its design, a modification of parallel processing thatsignificantly enhances performance, will greatly expand thecommercial applications of supercomputers, a market expected toreach $9 billion by 1993.   ``It's efficiency, price, performance, and ease of programmingwill make top-end supercomputer performance available to a muchbroader range of users,'' Leclerc said in a statement.   The trend toward better-performing supercomputers is driven bythe need of scientists and engineers to perform mathematicalmodeling. Improved computer modeling represents a qualitative leapforward in science and engineering and could have a major impact onevery technical discipline from drug research to integrated circuitdesign.   ``What we need are high-performing systems that are reasonablycost-efficient and interactive,'' said Roger Anderson, a computerresearch scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratorynear San Francisco.   If the company's machine lives up to its claims, it would be awelcome development in that direction, Anderson said.   The ES-1, which in some functions can run 1.6 billion operationsper second, will cost $2.2 million to $8 million.   Its high-performance capabilities are due to the fact that itseight processors are independent, allowing in some operations a 50percent improvement in efficiency, said Bob Stevens, vice presidentof marketing for the company's computer division.   The computer runs on an enhanced version of the popular Unixoperating system, allowing users to modify programs while the systemis running, an option not generally available to supercomputerusers, Stevens said.   The entry of Eandamp;S into the international supercomputer market isanother sign that American companies are upping the ante in theirbattle with Japanese manufacturers, which control about a quarter ofthe market. However, the company's main competitor is Cray.   To show it is serious in dominating the supercomputer market,Japan's NEC Corp. in April claimed it had developed the world'sspeediest such machine, capable of 20 billion operations per second.But NEC was quickly upstaged when NCube Inc. of Beaverton, Ore.,unveiled a machine that can do up to 27 billion operations persecond.   The United States leads in the development of parallelprocessing, which allows machines to divide large problems intosmaller ones and work on them simultaneously.   The key to ES-1's performance is a ``moderately'' parallelarchitecture that allows each of its 16 computational units perprocessor to either work together or independently on problemssubmitted by other users. Each computational unit has the power of amini-supercomputer, the company said.</TEXT></DOC>
