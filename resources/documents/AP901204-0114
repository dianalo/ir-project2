Gorbachev said Tuesday hewill crack down on black marketeering and boost food imports tofeed the nation this winter, and he wants people to plant their owngardens to raise food next year.   ``Rural and urban residents should be free to pursueagriculture,'' Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet legislature, whichhas demanded urgent steps to ease the food crisis.   Gorbachev also outlined proposed changes in the governmen,including the creation of a vice presidency and a Security Council.They also would streamline the Cabinet and strengthen theFederation Council, which includes representatives of therepublics.   Those changes require constitutional amendments, and the SupremeSoviet legislature voted 281-17 to recommend that the largerCongress of Peoples' Deputies amend the charter when it convenes onDec. 17.   Despite the lopsided vote, many legislators said they weredisappointed Gorbachev did not give more details on either the foodprogram or government restructuring, which he first outlined onNov. 17.   ``A lot of questions remain,'' said Fyodor Burlatsky, areformer. ``The president explained some general ideas, but wedon't know the real functions for the new institutions.''   Gorbachev, after fielding questions from legislators, said herejected accusations that the proposed changes reflected ``imperialambitions'' for the strengthened office of president, the officialnews agency Tass reported.   The president provided the most detailed statistics yet on thefood the Soviet Union plans to import with foreign aid he hassecured over the past two months.   During the first three months of 1991, he said the governmentwould spend about $1.2 billion on food. That included 10 milliontons of grain, 1.9 million tons of sugar, 156,000 tons of flour,277,000 tons of sunflower oil, 357,000 tons of meat and meatproducts, 4.5 million tons of milk products and 110,000 tons ofgroats.   The United States, Germany and Italy have begun sending food aidto the Soviet Union, and other nations have pledged support. Sovietofficials blame food problems on the collapse of the centraldistribution system.   Gorbachev said workers' control committees would be formed overthe next two or three weeks to make sure food is not diverted tothe black market from the state distribution system. The KGBsecurity police and state prosecutors have also been assigned tothis task, Soviet officials have said.   ``A survey by security bodies of 50 stores in Moscow has shownthat when the stores close, a `third shift' starts working. Thesame thing happens at warehouses,'' Gorbachev said. Workers oftenset aside scarce food for sale to acquaintances at inflated prices.   ``A new system is being created that will put the situationunder strict control,'' he said. ``We will take resolute actions.''   While tight controls and imports might ease the food crisis forthe next three or four months, Gorbachev said, food supplies couldbe increased if people were allowed to work their own gardens. Hesaid he would seek up to 12 million acres for ``private plot''farming.   The parliament of the Russian Federation, the largest of the 15Soviet republics, on Monday authorized private ownership offarmland, but Gorbachev balked at that step, and the garden plotswill remain under state and collective ownership.   Gorbachev also repeated plans to rename the Council of Ministersthe Cabinet of Ministers, under the direction of a prime minister,to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the legislature.Aides said Cabinet membership would drop from 56 ministers to about15.   The Cabinet of Ministers would be responsible to the president,and control the national budget, energy industries, transportation,environmental protection, and credit and foreign currency.   The Cabinet also would work with the republics on a nationalprogram for health insurance, maternity and child care issues,culture and education and basic scientific research.   Gorbachev said he would create a vice presidency, ``to be thepresident's right-hand man.''   He also would abolish the Presidential Council, created earlierthis year. Some of its members, probably the defense and interiorministers and head of the KGB, would be transferred to the newSecurity Council.   Gorbachev also would expand the powers of the FederationCouncil, which includes leaders of the 15 republics. It will beresponsible for ethnic issues and relations among the national andrepublican governments.</TEXT></DOC>
