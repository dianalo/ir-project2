Henri Martre, chairman of the state-owned company, said theEuropean companies have decided to form a new industrial alliancecalled European Future Large Aircraft Group, or Euroflag. The groupwill study a new military plane to replace the aging Franco-GermanTransall and the C130 Hercules made by Lockheed-Georgia Co. of theUnited States, he said.   In addition to Aerospatiale, the companies associated in Euroflagare British Aerospace PLC, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm Gmbh of WestGermany, Casa of Spain and Italy's Aeritalia. The first fourcompanies are already partners in Airbus Industrie, the Europeanconsortium that builds the Airbus family of commercial jets.   Martre told reporters the agreement effectively puts an end to aprevious accord called Future International Military Airlifter, orFIMA, in which the same five European companies were associated withLockheed.   The new consortium will continue to have relations with Lockheed,such as consulting on market surveys, Martre said, but the groupwill also be talking to other U.S. aircraft manufacturers.   The European companies and Lockheed have been carrying outpreliminary studies of a new military transport aircraft for severalyears, in anticipation of NATO's need to find a successor to theHercules and the Transall, which is made jointly by Aerospatiale andWest Germany's MBB.   But NATO has so far failed to come up with any definition of thekind of the aircraft that it requires.   Industry observers said the Europeans decided to take advantageof the uncertainty surrounding NATO's intentions to break theirformal ties with Lockheed.   The decision means they will be able to link up with the U.S.company that is eventually selected to produce the American versionof the aircraft.</TEXT></DOC>
