Cancels Its Proposal to Acquire Some Melridge Assets </HL><SO> </SO><CO> CGNE </CO><IN> TNM BCY </IN><DATELINE> DAVIS, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Calgene Inc., citing &quot;contingencies which could not be resolved,&quot; said it was dropping its $3.8 million proposal to buy certain assets of Melridge Inc., the nation's largest grower of lilies and daffodils.    Calgene, which uses gene-splicing techniques to develop such products as herbicide-resistant tobacco plants and long-lasting tomatoes, last month called the plan a &quot;strategic fit&quot; with its programs to genetically engineer cut flowers for extended shelf life and novel color traits.    Melridge, which is now protected from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, is best known for its spectacular crash last year, following discovery of what company officials allege was a complex and audacious fraud carried out by its former chairman and others. The former chairman hasn't responded to the allegations, citing Fifth Amendment privilege. </TEXT></DOC>
