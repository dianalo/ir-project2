Switzer Building),Washington, DC 20202-2518. Telephone: (202) 732-5707.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> The State Educational Agency (SEA)Program is authorized under section 7032 of the Bilingual Education Act,Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amendedby Pub. L. 100-297, enacted on April 28, 1988 (20 U.S.C. 3281-3341). Technicalamendments to the regulations to conform to the Act as amended by Pub.L. 100-297 (1988) were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on October 5, 1988 (53 FR 39222). These finalregulations reflect these changes. Section 548.10 of the regulations implement the requirement of the Actthat SEAs collect, analyze, and report data and information on limitedEnglish proficient persons and educational services provided or availableto those persons in their States. The Statewide aggregations of data andinformation required is described in section 7021(c)(2)(A)-(E) of the Act.On August 16, 1985, the Secretary published final regulations with invitationto comment for the SEA Program in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> (50 FR 33202-33206). <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes </ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation to comment, several parties submittedcomments on the final regulations. An analysis of the comments and of thechange in the regulations since publication of the final regulations withinvitation to comment follows. Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations towhich they pertain. Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changesthe Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutoryauthority_are not addressed. Section 548.10 What activities are required under this program? <T3>Comments:</T3> The Secretary received several comments regarding theunduly burdensome nature of the data and information that the regulationsrequired SEAs to collect, analyze, and report. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The data and information described in section 7021(c)(2)(F)-(J) of the Act pertain specifically to programs conducted by LEAs andare included in grant applications submitted by LEAs to the Secretary.The Secretary agrees that requiring SEAs to collect and report these datawould be unnecessarily duplicative. Requiring SEAs to collect and reportthe data and information described in section 7021(c)(2) (A)-(E) of theAct, provides statewide aggregations of data and information otherwiseunavailable to the Secretary. <T3>Changes:</T3> The requirement that SEAs collect, analyze, and reportdata and information pertaining to specific programs at LEAs (as describedin section 7021(c)(2) (F)-(J) of the Act) is deleted from the regulations. Section 548.11 What additional activities may a State educational agency(SEA) provide under this program? <T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter stated that the regulations should includeamong the additional activities allowed under this program training forSEA personnel in providing authorized services. The commenter stated furtherthat this training should be provided by the Office of Bilingual Educationand Minority Languages Affairs (OBEMLA), the OBEMLA Multifunctional ResourceCenters, and the OBEMLA Evaluation Assistance Centers.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 548.11(a)(5) authorizes training of SEA staffto carry out the purposes of Title VII programs. In order to give SEAsflexibility in meeting their training needs, this section does not restrictwho may provide this training. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Section 548.30 How are funds distributed to an SEA? <T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter requested a clarification of the processfor determining the amount of funds awarded to SEAs. The commenter suggestedthat the process include a ``funding motivation'', whereby an SEA wouldbe awarded a larger amount for assisting in the development of additionalprograms for limited English proficient students in the State. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The Act establishes the minimum and maximum levelsof funds that an SEA may receive in any fiscal year. In addition, the regulationsspecify that the Secretary will determine the amount of an award on thebasis of the reasonableness of an SEA's proposed budget to carry out theactivities required under andSection; 548.10, the need for any of the additionalactivities proposed under andSection; 548.11, and the total funds availablefor awards under this program. The Secretary believes that these factorsare sufficient for ensuring an equitable distribution of the funds. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the order. <ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review  </ITAG>This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 andthe regulations in 34 CFR Part 79.
