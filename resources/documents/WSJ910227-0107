Today the 112,000 people in this affluent suburb ofBuffalo are represented in Congress by GOP Rep. Bill Paxon.Those who live just a few miles to the west are representedby Democratic Rep. Henry Nowak. And the people who live a bitfarther north are represented by Democratic Rep. JohnLaFalce.</LP><TEXT>   But now that the Census Bureau has decreed that New York'sHouse delegation must shrink by three members, the future ofthese district lines -- and those affecting New York's 31other House members -- is up to state lawmakers in Albany. Bythe time they are through map making, chances are thatAmherst will be folded into one of the neighboring districts,that the three districts will become two -- and that two ofthe three House members are going to have to run against eachother in a battle for political survival.   Already, the three are growing increasingly uneasy -- evenas they continue to be thrust together at countless civicevents, such as the ribbon-cutting for a highway that beginsin Mr. Nowak's district, transsects Mr. Paxon's and ends inMr. LaFalce's.   The problem that holds the lawmakers hostage reflects themovement of population and political power away from theNortheast and the Midwestern industrial belt. New York grewonly 2.8% in the past decade, far less than the growth ratesof 33.4% in Florida and 26.1% in California. Thecongressmen's discomfort provides a case study of thepolitical problems, tensions and maneuvering that are spawnedby the trend; the jockeying, politicking and nudging alreadyhas begun.   The Democrats volunteer that Mr. Paxon, a 36-year-oldbachelor, can move easily if he wants to search for a placeto run. But neither Mr. Nowak, a former Canisius Collegebasketball star who has never been re-elected with less than75% of the vote, nor Mr. LaFalce, who is the chairman of theHouse Small Business Committee, wants to face an incumbentHouse member -- especially a young, aggressive Republicanlike Mr. Paxon.   For his part, Mr. Paxon, who just won his second term,says he's willing to take on either of the two nine-termDemocrats. But he thinks that his district, the only one ofthe three to grow in population in the past decade, should beone of the two survivors.   All three agree on one thing: Life would be a lot easierfor all of them if only Republican Rep. Frank Horton ofRochester, who turned 71 in December, would retire.   But Mr. Horton's retirement, which would allow thedistricts to reach eastward and permit all three of theBuffalo area congressmen to retain seats, is a very dim hope.   &quot;This is a mess, but it always is,&quot; says Joseph Crangle, amember of the Democratic National Committee and former stateparty chairman. &quot;But for all the problems it causes, it's ahealthy thing. It makes sure people don't go to Washingtonand forget where they came from. This reminds them where thestate capitol is.&quot; Indeed, the three men already are courtingthe Democratic-controlled assembly and theRepublican-controlled senate in Albany.   They also, however, remember what happened to the last manto mount a campaign for survival with an Albany offensive,Gary Lee. Then-Rep. Lee's efforts were so fruitless that hiscentral New York House district was divided into seven otherdistricts in 1982, forcing him to choose where to run. TheRepublican finally took on incumbent Democratic Rep. GeorgeWortley and lost by a handful of votes. Mr. Lee now sendsWhitman Samplers to House members -- he is the senior vicepresident, governmental relations, for Whitman Corp. -- andwatches congressional debates on television.   &quot;The logical way to approach this is to have state leaderssit down and try to figure out how to protect people who areserving on critical committees and can benefit the state,&quot;says Mr. Lee. &quot;But it doesn't happen. People want to protecttheir own tail rather than help the state.&quot;   Reps. Paxon, Nowak and LaFalce already have begun toposition themselves politically for significantly altereddistricts. &quot;We can't guess how things are going to bechanged,&quot; says Mr. LaFalce, whose victory margin slipped 18percentage points in the last election.   Mr. Nowak, at 55 the chairman of an importantwater-resources subcommittee, has been sending funds toprojects well outside his Buffalo-based district, directing$81 million to modernize Route 219, a four-lane highway inwestern New York, and finding funding for a marina on LakeErie's Turgeon Point. &quot;I've participated wherever theopportunities were, not just in my district,&quot; he says.   Mr. LaFalce, whose district already reaches from theBuffalo area to Rochester, is stressing his committeechairmanship and is winning extensive coverage in both mediamarkets, helpful publicity that spills well beyond theboundaries of his current district. Mr. Paxon, whose anti-taxattitudes mark him as the spiritual as well as actual heir toJack Kemp's old House seat, has begun some fund-raisingefforts in Rochester and is retaining a full-time politicalstaff.   &quot;I have always had a regional outlook,&quot; says Mr. Paxon,who went to high school at St. Joseph's Collegiate Institutein Mr. LaFalce's district and took his undergraduate degreefrom Canisius College in Mr. Nowak's district. &quot;I've beenactive in adjoining communities in western New York.&quot;   The redistricting struggle in this region is a classicexample of the interplay between demographics and politics.   Preliminary census data show that Buffalo, the anchor ofthe western New York region, lost nearly 8% of its populationin the past decade, making it smaller than it was in 1900.Niagara Falls, in Mr. LaFalce's district, now is smaller thanit was in 1930.   &quot;The steel industry in the Buffalo area has disappeared,and the chemical industry in the Niagara Falls area was tiedto steel -- and what wasn't tied to steel has become moreautomated,&quot; says David Brooks, the planner for Niagara Falls.Hugh Calkins, a geographer at the State University of NewYork at Buffalo adds: &quot;The weather here is a national joke,but the reason people leave is that the jobs aren't here.&quot;   Now that employment flight is endangering the job securityof the area's House members themselves.   For the time being, the lawmakers are trying to keep theiranxieties in check. &quot;I'm not consumed with it,&quot; says Mr.Paxon. &quot;I'm not tearing my hair out. I'm not going to gocrazy for the next two years.&quot;   Says Mr. LaFalce: &quot;When people say this thing has to besliced this way or that, I sit back and say, `How young theyare, how naive they are,'&quot; he says. &quot;There are a million waysto slice upstate New York.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
