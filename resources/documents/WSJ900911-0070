In recent years low-power lasers have been replacingconventional tools for cutting sheet metal and welding. Aswith many other technologies invented in the U.S., theJapanese have been in the forefront in integrating lasersinto their manufacturing processes. The pact with a leadingdeveloper of high-power lasers will &quot;give them . . .significant advantage&quot; in their manufacturing costs, saidEdward Peters, who follows lasers at the consulting firmArthur D. Little Inc.</LP><TEXT>   High-power lasers can cut thicker materials and can weldmore precisely and at higher speeds than low-end lasers,allowing significant manufacturing flexibility. The recentlycommercialized technology hasn't attracted many takers in theU.S., however. &quot;The demand isn't as intense as in Japan andEurope,&quot; said Jeffrey Carstens, general manager of UnitedTechnologies Industrial Lasers. &quot;That's one reason we want apresence in Japan.&quot;   Under the agreement, Hanwa Co. in Tokyo will market anddistribute United Technologies' carbon dioxide lasers, whosepowers will range between 10 and 25 kilowatts. Most lasers inuse in Japan produce less than one kilowatt, and thehighest-power laser available from Japanese companies is inthe 10-kilowatt range.   In Japan, the market for industrial lasers was $200million last year. &quot;We expect the Japanese market forhigh-power lasers to expand by over 400% in five years,&quot; saidShigeru Kita, president of Hanwa.   Mr. Carstens said that the lasers will be supplied fromthe U.S. and that there are no plans for joint productionbecause of the size of the market. A five-kilowatt lasercosts $460,000. A 25-kilowatt version is priced at $1million.   Arthur D. Little's Mr. Peters said that laser applicationsare also likely to get a major boost from Europeanmanufacturers. Under a plant modernization program, EuropeanCommunity members have singled out high-power lasers toincrease manufacturing efficiency and are spending tens ofmillions of dollars on laser technology, he said.   Mr. Peters estimated that the world market for industriallasers totaled $830 million in 1988, with Japan accountingfor 40% of all installed industrial lasers, the U.S. 33% andEurope 27%. He said he expects the world market to grow 8% to10% annually through 1994.</TEXT></DOC>
