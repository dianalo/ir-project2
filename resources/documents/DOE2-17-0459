While this cluster represents less than 10% of the VAX computingpower at BNL (6 MIPS out of 70), it has served as an important centerfor this larger network, supporting special hardware and software tooexpensive to maintain on every machine. In addition, it is the only unrestrictedfacility available to VAX/VMS users (other machines are typically dedicatedto special projects). This committee's analysis shows that the cpu'son the CSCF cluster are currently badly oversaturated, frequently givingextremely poor interactive response. Short batch jobs (a necessary partof interactive work) typically take 3 to 4 times as long to execute asthey would on an idle machine. There is also an immediate need for morescratch disk space and user permanent file space.</TEXT></DOC>
