Schleifer of the National Institute forOccupational Safety and Health in Cincinnati and O. Geoffrey Okogbaa of theUniversity of Cincinnati, measured psychophysiological effects from twovariables: slow vs.andP;  rapid computer response and incentive vs.andP;  non-incentivepay.andP;  The subjects were 45 professional typists working during a four dayperiod.andM;Computer response time did not affect heart rates or blood pressuresignificantly.andP;  However, when the typists were working for incentive pay,their blood pressure increased significantly and their heart rates becamemore variable.andM;Regardless of computer response time or method of pay, heart rates fell orbecame variable if the typists entered data for sustained periods, indicatinga drop-off in effort or mental fatigue.andM;Schleifer and Okogbaa said most prior research on the stress ofcomputer-related work has relied on self-reported psychological andbehavioral disturbances rather than physiological measurements.andM;They said several studies indicate that slow computer response creates stressand dissatisfaction; one study stated only 20 percent of VDT users willaccept a response time longer than 10 seconds.andM;A January study by Schleifer and Benjamin C. Amick III reported that a slowcomputer response time of three to 10 seconds causes higher frustrationratings among workers than a rapid response time of 350 milliseconds.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
