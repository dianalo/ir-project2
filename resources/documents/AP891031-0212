The government issued a statement denying the reports, whichcome barely three weeks before a national election in whichGandhi's opponents have made corruption-in-government their battlecry.   Gandhi is fighting for his political life in what is expected tobe the closest election in India's 42 years of independence.   Three major English-language Indian dailies carried the reports.They were The Hindu and The Statesman, which are traditionallyindependent, and the anti-Gandhi Indian Express.   The Calcutta-based Statesman said: ``The possibility of thePrime Minister himself being involved in the pay-offs and ininitiating cover-up operations in the wake of the Bofors disclosurehas finally emerged with references in official documents tomeetings between the representative of a company involved in thepay-offs and a Gandhi `trustee lawyer.'''   Indian Express, a nationwide paper and Gandhi's harshest criticamong the major media, was blunter, saying, ``Direct andirrefutable evidence is now in hand ... which establishes thedirect involvement of the Prime Minister, Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, and hisintimates in the corrupt Bofors pay-off.''   About nine hours after the newspapers reached readers, thegovernment information office issued a statement denying Gandhi wasinvolved.   The scandal arises from a $1.4 billion contract signed in 1986by Gandhi's government and the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors.According to accounts previously published by Indian newspapers,Bofors paid up to $50 million in kickbacks to beat out competitorsfor the contract.   Tuesday's newspaper reports were the most direct purported linkbetween Gandhi and the alleged payoffs. Previous reports spoke ofmoney going to people close to Gandhi.   Gandhi repeatedly said he did not personally benefit from thedeal. He denied any commissions were paid or that any Indiansreceived payments.   The latest stories focused on purported entries in a personaldiary kept by former Bofors company president Martin Ardbo.   The key element, according to The Statesman and Indian Express,is a handwritten entry that speaks of a meeting between an unnamed``Gandhi trustee lawyer'' and a person identified only as ``Bob''in Geneva on July 2, 1987.   The newspapers said Bob was Robert Wilson, a former British armymajor who headed AE Services, a company previously cited by Indianand Swedish newspapers as a middleman in the Bofors contract.</TEXT></DOC>
