(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Colombian reputed to be an importantfigure in the Medellin cocaine cartel was convicted Saturday on twofederal drug conspiracy counts.   Jose Abello Silva faces up to $8 million in fines and 30 yearsin prison. U.S. District Judge Thomas Brett set sentencing for May29.   Jurors convicted Abello, 35, of conspiring to import marijuanaand cocaine into the United States and conspiring to possess drugswith intent to distribute.   His attorneys said they would appeal.   Abello met with his attorneys after the verdicts and sobbed,said defense attorney Richard Haynes.   ``It's a normal human reaction,'' Haynes said. ``He'sdevastated. He's hurt. He's terribly disappointed. He cried. Icried.''   The jury deliberated a little more than 20 hours over three daysbefore issuing its verdicts. Jurors' identities remained secretthroughout, for security reasons.   Prosecutors called 23 witnesses during five weeks of testimony.Many were convicted drug smugglers who identified Abello in thecourtroom and said he supervised drug shipments from Colombianairstrips through the Bahamas.   Abello testified that he was an honest rancher who sold importedcars and fought bulls on the side. He said he was a friend of theOchoa family _ alleged to be part of the leadership of the Medellindrug cartel _ but said his visits were limited to dealings withcattle.   Haynes and co-counsel Patrick Williams said prosecutors' secrecyabout witnesses hurt their case, and Haynes criticized pretrialpublicity.   ``We'll appeal. We think there are some errors in the case,''Williams said. ``This has been couched in secrecy. We were totallydenied access to previous statements witnesses made.''   Williams said many of the witnesses were confessed drugsmugglers and suggested they had lied about Abello to shorten theirown prison sentences.   ``Snitches behind bars can come up with stories that will foolgood investigators, that will fool good prosecutors and that aretotally untrue,'' Williams said.   Abello, of Santa Marta, Colombia, was indicted in Tulsa in 1987.He was extradited Oct. 29 from Bogota to Tulsa.   Colombia's Administrative Security Department said he had beenarrested in a Bogota restaurant and that he had undergone facialsurgery to avoid easy detection.   It also said Abello was the fourth-ranking person in theMedellin cocaine cartel.   The Administrative Security Department said Abello was thecartel's chief of operations for Colombia's northern coast, wheredozens of clandestine air strips are used to smuggle 300 to 400tons of cocaine into the United States each year. That region alsohas ports where cocaine is stashed aboard rusty freighters workingthe coast of Central America and Mexico.   Abello was not on the U.S. Justice Department's list of 12 mostwanted traffickers, but the department has said it wanted dozens ofother Colombians on federal drug charges.   Of 15 Colombians extradited to the United States since lastAugust, Abello is the first whose case has reached a verdict.   The case against Abello started in 1986 when Oklahomaauthorities arrested a drug courier en route to Denver. He agreedto cooperate under a plea agreement and helped police hook BorisOlarte Morales.   Olarte also agreed to cooperate and began making telephone callsto fellow smugglers. The calls resulted in a February 1987 meetingin Aruba, off Venezuela's coast, between Abello and several others.   Prosecutors contended Abello agreed to import 500 kilograms ofcocaine _ more than half a ton _ into the United States. Part ofthe proceeds allegedly would have gone to help free Olarte. Theplan was never enacted.   Abello testified that he attended the meeting in Aruba, but saidhe stormed out of the room when the conversation turned to drugs.</TEXT></DOC>
