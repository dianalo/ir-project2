(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Unisys Corp. entered the emerging marketof digital image processing Wednesday with two systems that willallow crisp images of checks and blueprints to be storedelectronically.   The company's Image Item Processing System will be available inthe first quarter of 1990 for an average of $1.5 million to $3million. Combined with the software Image Check Processing System,it will allow high-speed image processing of payment items for thebanking industry.   The Unisys InfoImage Engineering Document Management System,available now starting at $500,000, allows storage of suchdocuments as blueprints, engineering drawings, charts and buildingdiagrams. Software permits the digitized documents to be indexedand called up onto display work stations along with data in othercomputer systems.   ``Unisys is committed to a leadership role in the imagingrevolution, which will produce more than $5 billion in revenue by1992, up from $800 million in 1988,'' said L.W. ``Roy'' Beers, vicepresident for document imaging systems.   Dennis P. Farkas, vice president for financial and imagingprograms, said imaging allows banks to reduce the repeated physicalhandling of paper items, which leads to processing errors.   Savings in labor and other costs will pay for the system inabout three years, he said.   ``We're looking at this as a major growth area for thecompany,'' he said.   Unisys expects to capture 40 percent to 45 percent of aprojected $2.3 billion payment-item processing market by 1993, ofwhich $1.2 billion will be in imaging, he said.   Unisys currently has about a 25 percent share of the $850million traditional processing market worldwide, he said.   Chase Manhattan Bank, Huntington Bancshares Inc. of Columbus,Ohio, and The Northern Trust Co. of Chicago have announced plans touse the check-processing system, Unisys said.   Rolls-Royce and Associates Ltd. of Britain, the high-technologydefense contracting subsidiary of Rolls-Royce PLC, will use thedocument system.   Unisys said last month it had formed a corporate office forimaging systems to coordinate a comprehensive strategic commitmentto document and payment imaging systems. It said technology hadprogressed to the point where imaging systems could generate fastpayback and cost savings to a broad range of users.   In recent weeks, Unisys also announced a series of strategicrelationships with industry-leading image technology vendors tointegrate their innovative technology into Unisys informationmanagement systems.</TEXT></DOC>
