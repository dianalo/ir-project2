The Tokyoexchange closed for holidays Friday and Monday.</LP><TEXT>   In Frankfurt, the DAX index rose just 1.8 points to thenew high of 1631.84, but dealers said the air was gettingrarefied at current levels, as stocks have been rewritingtheir record books often. Bank stocks gained on foreigninterest, while chemical and auto issues declined.   In London, few investors wanted to establish new positionsahead of the threeday weekend in Britain, where markets areclosed today for a holiday. Many investors last week alsowere waiting for midMay inflation data, in hopes this couldusher in a fresh round of interest-rate cuts.   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell8.0 points to 2522.7. The FT-SE 30-share index was off 7.1points at 1973.9. Volume was a meager 452.7 million shares,compared with 516.6 million shares a day earlier. Londontraders also didn't take much notice of Wall Street's earlyclimb into positive territory, nudged by U.S. unemploymentdata suggesting the American recession could be bottomingout. And London's stock market response was measured afterthe Conservatives' significant losses in the municipalelections to the party's main rival, Labor, and the smaller,centrist Liberal Democrats.   Stocks closed higher in Paris, Milan and Madrid, and lowerin Zurich and Amsterdam, and were mixed in Brussels and flatin Stockholm. South African gold shares finished slightlyhigher and industrials were lower.   In Paris, credit-sensitive stocks, such as banks andcompanies with heavy debts, continued to get a boost fromlast week's lending-rate cuts in the U.S. Madrid sharesclimbed in lively trading fueled by gains on global marketsand a cut in yields on certain Spanish bonds.   Share prices closed higher in Hong Kong, Taipei andWellington, and lower in Sydney, Singapore and Seoul, andwere little changed in Manila.   Hong Kong's climb, on the back of the previous session's2.6% surge, was pared by late profit-taking. Taipei's rallyfollowed two previous declines, but volume remained low inthe face of the 6000 technical barrier on the market'sweighted index. Wellington's big gains came on a positiveoutlook for New Zealand's domestic interest rates; the sharprally in domestic debt markets remained the biggest influenceon Wellington stocks. In Sydney, the market lost 0.1%, itsfourth consecutive decline, as buying from overseas marketparticipants dried up. Singapore's fall was broad, asinvestors liquidated positions amid recent bearish short-termsentiment. Seoul stocks' slight decline came in reaction toThursday's sharp gains.
