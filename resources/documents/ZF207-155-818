 You're looking for someone with management experience to helpyou lay out a strategy for dealing with your agency's horrendous softwareobsolescence problem.andM;You know this is going to be critical during the next couple of years ofshrinking budgets.andP;  Cutting operations and maintenance costs is the only wayyou're going to be able to get the resources you need to satisfy the demandfor new systems applications.andP;  You've decided that purging old systems is theanswer.andM;You've just learned that someone you know from a larger agency, who is wellqualified, is interested.andP;  His supervisor thinks it would be a gooddevelopment move for him and is willing to let him go.andP;  And the move can bemade quickly as he already is a member of the Senior Executive Service.andM;You get a call from the office of your department's new secretary.andP;  Thepresidnet's personnel office is on their backs about placing Schedule Cpolitical appointeesandM;They have one who is with a well-known personal computer software company andthey want to put him in your open slot.andP;  He headed up the software company'spublic affairs office.andM;Scenario Two: You knew this morning it was going to be a bad day when youread your favorite newspaper reporter's interview with your agency's favoritewhistle-blower about a General Accounting Office report on your smallcomputer systems plan.andP;  Except for the Reader' Digest title, the reportwasn't all that bad.andP;  You remember, with slight amusement, explaining to thelead investigator the significance of programming an operating system in theC language.andM;You also think aobut the vendor's representative and the staff member of youragency's oversight committee who were responsible for initiating the GAOstudy.andP;  You're not amused at that thought.andM;Scenario Three: You've just come back from lunch and you're in a pretty goodmood.andP;  You get a call from the assistant secretary in charge of yourdivision.andP;  She wants you to meet with a friend of hers who has a new partnerin her business development consulting firm.andM;The new partner was a political adviser during the campaign.andP;  You rememberseeing his name a couple of times in the papers.andM;The represent a minority firm that has done business with your agency in thepast.andP;  You are about to release a request for proposals, and they would liketo see it changed to a small business set-aside.andP;  You know the firm has hadto subcontract some of the more technically difficult parts of past contractsand the new RFP is 10 times the size of anything they have done before.andM;Undoing the ProcessandM;What I have tried to do here is illustrate with examples a special class ofproblems faced by senior government officials.andP;  In each case, a specialinterest threatens to block a business objective or government affair.andM;In each case, an individual, acting either on his own behalf or representinga community of interest, alone or in concert with members of other factions,for open or covert reasons, has injected himself into your organization'sdecision-making process.andM;The art of dealing with such special interests when pursuing organizationalobjectives is what we call &quot;politics.&quot;andP;  The government manager has to decidewhether the organization's objective needs to be changed or dropped and whatother actions are necessary or possible to resolve the political situation.andM;The rightness or wrongness of the special interest and whether it is more orless important than the organization's objective is not the basis for makingthat decision, although the manager may have to make such a judgment indeciding what to do.andM;However, it's often not the manager's decision to make.andP;  And the real problembecomes one of convincing someone else of what needs to be done.andP;  How to dothat may be the real test of one's political ability.andM;It sometimes helps to remember Robert Leavitt's admonition: &quot;People don't askfor facts in making up their minds.andP;  They would rather have one good,soul-satisfying emotion than a dozen facts.&quot; Unfortunately, that often worksto the advantage of the special interest.andM;Senior government officials will face a serious political challenge in theearly 1990s under the Bush administration.andP;  Special interests increasinglywill attack organizational objectives, and government officials will findtheir positions less frequently sustained by higher-level governmentappointees.andM;Opportunity KnocksandM;Why?andP;  Members of special-interest groups are advocates of causes that theysupport earnestly.andM;With any change in administration they see an opportunity for a new start topush for their agenda.andM;For that reason alone, you would see an increase in the number of incidents.andO;But, more importantly, they see a change in the management style of the Bushadministration from that of the Reagan administration, a change they thinkwill work to their advantage.andP;  The Reagan administration mind-set was thatbig government was bad but big defense was good, and the Grace Commission andReform '88 were -- do I dare say it? -- the savings grace of governmentoperations.andM;While simplistic, this management philosophy tended to make it easy toresolve disputes.andP;  They usually came down in favor of moving ahead with theplan in place.andM;The Bush administration agenda is not as single-minded, and administrativedecision-making will tend to be fuzzier and not as consistent.andM;There is no overarching vision, no overriding goal or objective.andP;  A kinderand gentler America and a thousand points of light don't leave you with astrong management imperative.andM;The Bush administration has two political goals: a second term for GeorgeBush and Republican control of the House of Representatives.andP;  The majority ofthe political appointees from the Reagan administration will be replaced, notto pay off the Bush loyalists but to prepare the way for the next campaign.andM;That changeover is important.andP;  If the Reagan appointees could be described asideologues, then the Bush appointees can be characterized as pragmatists.andP;  Inthe absence of any strongly held beliefs, they will make their decisionsbased on broad objectives such as bipartisanship, an objective that supportstheir political goals.andM;This will tend to work to the advantage of special interests that will actwith dedication and zeal in the pursuit of their specific objectives.andM;Ironically, it now seems that the Bush people agree with Michael Dukakis thatthe issue is competence.andP;  And they're going all out to prove it.andM;But, as the election demonstrated, ideological concerns are more likely tocarry the day.andP;  They should listen to Leavitt if they don't believe their ownexperience.andP;  Otherwise, in this race, the special interests will win.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
