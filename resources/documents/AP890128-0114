PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man whose mother hid a note in herunderwear saying that her son killed her before she was found deadtwo years ago has pleaded innocent to a new indictment charging him.   ``There's no doubt he's depressed,'' Earl Gray, Richard Dziubak'sattorney, said after court Friday. ``Wouldn't you be having to facecharges again when you know you haven't done anything?''   Dziubak, 36, originally pleaded guilty to manslaughter after headmitted pushing his mother, May Hilda Speiser, 65, during anargument at the top of the basement stairs in their home in February1987. But experts later differed on whether it was the fall, or asubsequent drug overdose, that actually killed the woman.   Dziubak said that after she fell down the stairs, she rejectedhis offers of help and walked up two floors to her bedroom. She wasfound dead in bed the next day, having left a note stating, ``Dickkilled me threw me down basement.''   Following his guilty plea, Dziubak was sentenced in June 1987 toan 81-month prison term. Ramsey County District Judge Allan Markertreleased Dziubak in November 1988 and allowed him to withdraw hisplea because of the experts' conflicting views on what had actuallykilled the woman.   On Wednesday, a grand jury indicted Dziubak on charges ofsecond-degree murder, second-degree manslaughter and third-degreeassault.   On Friday, Markert let Dziubak remain free without bond becausethe defendant had not fled the state after being released fromprison, had no record of violence and had a job.   Gray said he will file a motion to dismiss the indictment forlack of probable cause, and Markert set a hearing date of March 1.Trial was scheduled for April 10.</TEXT></DOC>
