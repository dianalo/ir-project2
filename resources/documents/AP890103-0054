At least two other organizations seeking to promote Polish-U.S.relations have attempted to gain legal status since 1987, but weredenied permission.   The Poland-USA Association, registered in the western city ofPoznan, will be allowed to operate nationwide, the state-run PAPnews agency said in a dispatch Monday. Its goal will be tofamiliarize Poles with current social, economic and political issuesin the United States.   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Warsaw said the embassy was aware ofthe group.
