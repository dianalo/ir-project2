 The Stardent GS2000 in use at the University ofWisconsin's Space Science and Engineering Center is a case in point.andM;&quot;Our Stardent is being used both as a superworkstation and as a server forabout 10 researchers performing weather modeling on PCs, Sun workstations anddumb terminals,&quot; said Bill Hibbard, a university researcher.andM;With educational discounts, the Space Science and Engineering Center paidabout $130,000 for the superworkstation and another $2,500 for a three-yearcooperative maintenance contract with Stardent.andP;  The operating system andtraining were included in the purchase price.andM;According to Hibbard, the Space Science and Engineering Center decided to buya superworkstation to help perform interactive analyses of weather data.andP;  &quot;Wehad been using an IBM mainframe to perform computational work, then loadingthe visualization translations onto a workstation,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It took fourhours to complete these tasks.andP;  Now, on the Stardent, it's instantaneous.&quot;andM;Hibbard chose the Stardent GS2000 based on its flexibility for performingvisualization tasks.andP;  &quot;Flexibility requires high bandwidth, and the Stardenthas a very high bus and memory bandwidth,&quot; he explained.andP;  &quot;And Stardent isvery much in the standards world, with Unix, X windows and TCP/IP.andP;  I likethat.&quot;andM;Using VIS-5D--visualization software developed in-house by the center--usersare completing projects in hours that previously required weeks or months.andO;&quot;We can simulate a volcano eruption using five-dimensional arrays of data.andO;The superworkstation allows us to change items like horizontal wind speed orwind direction and generate a new animation sequence instantly,&quot; Hibbardsaid.andM;Hibbard feels so strongly about the value of these tools in scientificresearch that he travels around the world in an effort to generate interestand funding that will put superworkstations into the hands of morescientists.andM;He recently spoke at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecastingin Reading, England, and at the National Meteorological Center in Washington,D.C.andP;  In addition, he and the Space Science and Engineering Center providethe VIS-5D software free to researchers.andM;&quot;Interactive visualization will revolutionize the way scientists work bygiving them effective access to enormous amounts of data,&quot; Hibbard said.andO;&quot;Previously, the information was hidden in the data like a needle in ahaystack.andP;  Now the interactivity of superworkstations lets us find thatneedle very quickly.&quot;andM;THINKING BIGandM;Although Hibbard had to share the power of the superworkstation among severalusers to justify it, others buying these machines have had an easier time.andM;The NASA-Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., is one of the oldestand most extensive users of superworkstations for graphics visualization andcomputational capabilities.andM;NASA-Ames has about 30 Silicon Graphics 4D superworkstations used inconjunction with Cray 2 and Cray YMP supercomputers.andP;  The superworkstationsrun visualization software developed by Sterling Software of Palo Alto,Calif., to display the Cray's simulations of the flow of engine emissions andair over an aircraft during flight.andP;  The superworkstations create animatedgraphics of the simulations, which are then stored on video or film.andM;According to Val Watson, NASA-Ames' chief of workstation applications, thesuperworkstations are used strictly for visualization.andP;  &quot;If we want tocalculate flow patterns from an area on a flow field around an aircraft inflight,&quot; he said, &quot;the supercomputer will calculate the patterns and sendthem back to be visualized on the superworkstation.&quot;andM;Watson said he justified the purchase of his department's two SiliconGraphics 4D superworkstations--and encouraged his colleagues in otherdepartments to do the same--by considering NASA-Ames' overall annualinvestment.andM;&quot;We spend $50 million a year on supercomputing facilities,&quot; Watson said.andO;&quot;Approximately $5 million a year goes to new superworkstations and themaintenance and support of existing superworkstations.andM;&quot;Superworkstations and the appropriate software make the Crays more effectivefor us by providing a well-balanced, distributed system,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It wouldbe a mistake for us to skimp on or cut out superworkstations.&quot;andM;NASA-Ames' first venture into workstations began five years ago when thecenter bought low-end workstations to replace 30 dumb terminals linked to twoVAXes.andP;  But for Watson and the scientists, it seemed that more was neverenough.andM;&quot;We would find that we were not able to analyze the data as effectively as wewanted,&quot; Watson said.andP;  &quot;Our scientists spent a lot of time trying tounderstand complex computations on the supercomputers, and sometimes theymissed the implications because they couldn't see the data representedvisually.&quot;andM;The two Silicon Graphics 4D superworkstations in Watson's department werepurchased in January 1989.andP;  Watson chose Silicon Graphics for its highgraphics performance, which--in his estimation--was better than thatavailable from other vendors.andM;Although his staff already had a background in physics, programming andgraphics, Watson invested in training for five of his staff members.andP;  Eachperson attended two three- to five-day sessions that included a basicintroduction as well as lessons on using Unix on Silicon Graphics systems andworking with graphics primitives.andP;  The cost was $1,000 per course, and Watsonsaid it took about three months for the five staff members to get fully up tospeed.andM;NASA-Ames has experienced several benefits from using superworkstations.andO;Scientists can now perform tasks that were impossible to do with the 2-Dwire-frame capabilities of NASA-Ames' older workstations, which simplyoutlined the results created by the Crays.andM;Previously, the data generated by NASA-Ames' computational fluid dynamicssimulations--equivalent to stack of paper 11 feet high for each &quot;snapshot&quot;image of gases flowing over the aircraft--would have been too cumbersome toevaluate.andP;  Now, once the Cray has generated analytical results, the data isdownloaded to a Silicon Graphics superworkstation for display, lettingscientists view and manipulate the 3-D flow.andP;  This helps the scientistsevaluate the actions and consequences of any flow being studied.andM;This process can be extremely valuable.andP;  Showing air- and fluid-particletraces flowing over the aircraft can alert engineers to design problems.andP;  Forexample, a visual display on the superworkstation showed the main engine ofNASA's space shuttle developing separations on some fittings, causingexcessive pressure.andP;  The fittings were redesigned based on the results ofthis output.andM;The superworkstations are also used for 3-D simulations of fluid flow overaircraft moving at speeds of 2500 mph.andP;  Previously, these aircraft could betested only in wind tunnels, which have velocity limits of 300 mph to 400mph.andP;  Using superworkstations and Crays to simulate these tests has savedtime and money by reducing the need for wind-tunnel testing.andM;&quot;We're going to solve problems in the future that we wouldn't even havethought of before,&quot; Watson said.andP;  &quot;More physics simulation will be done onsuperworkstations, and there will be an increasing shift toward using them inthe office.&quot;andM;HEALTHY SOLUTIONSandM;To get a high rate of return from superworkstations, successful users oftenemploy one or more machines as both workstations and servers.andP;  This offersmaximum flexibility and expandability.andM;The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., uses about 50 superworkstations for itswork in biotechnology research.andP;  Dr. Rich Robb, director of biotechnologycomputer resource, said his department has 12 Sun-4s and Sparcstations, sixSilicon Graphics 4D machines, two Mips RS2030s as well as one Solbourne4/602.andP;  All of these machines are networked over Ethernet using NFSnetworking software with TCP/IP protocols.andM;The machines run the Analyze software package that the Mayo Clinic developedin-house to perform magnetic resonance imaging research.andP;  Analyze isavailable through Cemax of Santa Clara, Calif.andM;Magnetic resonance imaging is a technique that uses magnetism to visualizemolecular disturbances in water.andP;  Because the human body is made up mostly ofwater, magnetic resonance imaging can be used to visualize the body's softissues and to detect abnormalities, such as brain tumors.andM;It's particularly useful because, unlike CAT-scan techniques, magneticresonance imaging does not use radiation to produce its images.andM;PRECISE DISPLAYandM;The Mayo Clinic is using Analyze to show blood-flow patterns with a precisionso fine that it allows researchers to see plaque adhesions within bloodvessels.andM;&quot;Three Sun-4s and one Silicon Graphics machine are used as file servers toexchange software and image files,&quot; Robb said.andM;&quot;Our main computer server is the Silicon Graphics 4D/220.andP;  It's a good fileand compute server and excellent for expandability.andP;  It can be expanded toeight CPUs and a performance of 160 MIPS,&quot; he added.andM;Robb said educational and volume discounts allowed the Mayo Clinic topurchase its Sparcstations for less than $25,000 each and its SiliconGraphics 4D superworkstations for about $75,000 each.andM;The other systems were obtained at discounts of between 30 percent and 50percent.andP;  Maintenance accounts for about 10 percent of the cost of thediscounted systems per year.andM;Because the Mayo Clinic is a non-profit research facility, Robb said he doesnot do a cost-benefits analysis for his department.andP;  A cost-per-seat fee of$55 per hour is charged, however, because each department is run on abreakeven cost-center basis.andP;  Developers occupy the superworkstations between50 percent and 60 percent of the time.andM;Because the clinic is developing imaging software, Robb said, &quot;our majorcosts are software people--and for us, that's where the investment should bemade.andP;  People account for 70 percent of our overall facility costs.&quot;andM;That figure makes sense--the clinic is the foremost supplier of magneticresonance imaging software in the world, as well as one of its earliestpioneers.andM;The Mayo Clinic is now collaborating with more than 30 institutionsinternationally, including the National Institutes of Health in Washington,D.C., Queen's Hospital in London and the University of Vienna in Austria, allof which also have superworkstations.andM;Information is exchanged via electronic mail, and files are transferredbetween these institutions over networks such as NSFnet and ARPAnet.andM;According to Robb, this activity is centered primarily around distributingthe Analyze software.andP;  &quot;Image files are not really transferred much, sincethe images are fairly standard,&quot; he explained.andM;&quot;Superworkstations have really freed us from the constraints of time andmemory,&quot; Robb said.andP;  &quot;Now we can be more creative and perform testing morequickly.andM;&quot;But in considering future acquisitions, we will continue to do asbefore--base any and all decisions on the problems we want to solve and thesoftware we want to use to solve them,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;This is what anyoneconsidering superworkstations should do.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
