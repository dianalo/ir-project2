Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman ofthe Senate Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday as Pentagonofficials described the impact of automatic reductions on the fourmilitary branches.   The 2.1 million active duty armed forces would have to bereduced by about 229,000 in fiscal 1990 under the cuts, with theAir Force cut by 80,000, the Navy by 76,000, the Army by 62,000 andthe Marine Corps by 11,000.   Military contracts for such big-ticket items as themultiple-warhead MX nuclear missile and the Advanced TacticalFighter would also have to be renegotiated, the Pentagon said.   The automatic budget cuts are necessary because of Congress'failure to pass a deficit reconciliation bill aimed at complyingwith the budget-cutting requirements of the Gramm-Rudmanbudget-balancing law.   President Bush has said he would be willing to live with thecutbacks in fiscal 1990 rather than accept a budget reconciliationbill that does not result in real deficit reductions. The presidentis seeking $14 billion in cuts; Congress has indicated a $12billion cut is possible.   House and Senate negotiators are still thrashing outreconciliation legislation.   Without the legislation, federal programs would suffer $16.1billion in automatic cuts, with half targeting the DefenseDepartment.   The Senate Armed Services Committee invited Pentagon officialsto Capitol Hill to describe the impact of the automatic budgetcuts. At the session, however, members of the panel fell intopartisan bickering.   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., said he could not believe that Bush,``the great defender of America,'' would accept the defensereductions that would be ``absolutely devastating'' to the military.   ``The effect of this decision would be to take us back to thereadiness levels of the mid-1970s,'' said Sen. Albert Gore Jr.,D-Tenn., who indicated that the ``zillions of dollars'' spentduring the Reagan and Bush administrations on building up thenation's defense would be for naught.   But Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on thecommittee, said Congress must share some of the blame.   ``We're in this hearing because Congress failed to do its job,''Warner said. ``We've got a lot of faults. We didn't come into thiswith clean hands.''   In the House, Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking Republicanon the Budget Committee, shrugged off the concerns expressed bySenate Democrats, and told reporters the Bush administration is``not paralyzed with fear like the last administration was'' overthe automatic cuts.   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., said that if ``defense had moreflexibility,'' he would favor the required budget cuts.   During the session, the Defense Department's comptroller, SeanO'Keefe, and representatives of the Army, Navy, Air Force andMarine Corps described the steps they would have to take inresponse to the 4.3 percent across-the-board cuts.   O'Keefe urged Congress to approve a Pentagon request that wouldgive them the authority to move money around to minimize the effectof the automatic budget cuts.   Nunn said he supports that request but indicated othercongressional committees oppose the Pentagon's call and thelikelihood of approval is slim.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will comply with the budget cuts``however painful that may be,'' O'Keefe said.</TEXT></DOC>
