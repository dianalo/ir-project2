Manuel Antonio Noriega because he heard the ``outcry of thepeople'' against the military strongman, says a leading Panamanianexile.   The Central American nation's legislative assembly removedPresident Eric Arturo Delvalle and the vice president from officeduring an emergency session early today.   Roberto Eisenmann, 50-year-old exiled publisher of Panama'sleading independent newspaper, La Prensa, said earlier that eitherway the power struggle went, ``Noriega will lose.''   ``I don't think he will find any nation that would recognize hisgovernment (in the event of a coup),'' said Eisenmann, who said hisnewspaper was shut down Thursday by the military.   Delvalle's decision to challenge Noriega was made after sevenweeks of negotiations here between the president and half a dozenopposition leaders, participants in the talks told The Miami Heraldin a story published today.   The last stage leading to the decision began in early January,when the then-Panamanian consul to New York, Jose Blandon, met withseveral opposition leaders in the home of former PanamanianAmbassador and anti-Noriega crusader Gabriel Lewis Galindo in theMiami suburb of Kendall.   ``Blandon had just spent 10 hours with Delvalle in New York,''Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of the Christian DemocraticParty, told the Herald. ``He told us the president was ready tooust Noriega, but that he wanted to do that as of Aug. 12.''   That date marked the fifth anniversary of Noriega's rise to thehelm of Panama's Defense Forces.   But the opposition politicians told Delvalle that if Noriega wasgiven that much time, he would be able to regroup.   On Feb. 16, the opposition counseled the president to go toWashington, convene an emergency session of the Organization ofAmerican States and announce Noriega's dismissal, the Heraldreported.   A week ago Wednesday, Delvalle met with U.S. Assistant Secretaryof State Elliott Abrams, whom he informed he would fire Noriega,but in Panama, not in the United States.   ``The thing that worked on him was the enormous outcry of thepeople,'' Eisenmann told ABC's ``Nightline'' Thursday night.``There was pressure from his family not to go down the tubes withNoriega.''   Noriega was indicted three weeks ago in Tampa and Miami onfederal charges of aiding drug smugglers, and has been underpressure to step down as military chief.   Gilbert Mallol, who directs the National Civic Crusade, aPanamanian opposition coalition of 192 organizations, predictedThursday during a visit to Miami that Delvalle's move would forceNoriega into seizing power and remove the ``facade of democracy.''   Mallol, a 32-year-old engineer, lived here in exile aftereluding military police and fleeing Panama last summer. His groupwas accused last August of plotting against Noriega, but Mallolrecently had returned to Panama.   A prosecutor in Noriega's drug case said he knew of no U.S. dealto drop charges in order to encourage Delvalle to challenge themilitary leader.   Richard Gregorie, chief assistant U.S. attorney in Florida'ssouthern district, said if Noriega were to leave Panama, ``We wouldattempt to extradite him like any other dope dealer.''   The Feb. 4 indictments charge Noriega and 15 others with takingat least $4.6 million in payoffs to protect shipments of Colombiancocaine, launder money, supply drug laboratories and shield drugkingpins.   The indictment also alleged that Noriega was allied with theMedellin cartel, the organization reputed to supply much of thecocaine in the United States, and once enlisted the help of Cubanleader Fidel Castro to mediate a dispute with the cartel over drugmoney.   Castro, who was named in the indictment but not charged, angrilydenied the any role in an interview with NBC News aired Thursdaynight.   If Noriega is ever brought to trial and convicted of allcharges, he could face up to 145 years in prison and fines of morethan $1.1 million.</TEXT></DOC>
