When more than one source is used, the total radiated acousticenergy depends on the separation of the sources and is not constant,even when the separation is sufficiently large that the individual signaturesare substantially unaffected. The authors believe that this long-rangeinteraction has not been described before in the literature and havecalled it energy-interaction. The existence of energy-interaction isdemonstrated experimentally for airguns. In the experiment presented,the acoustic output is more than doubled because of energy-interaction.Two methods are described for computing the energy of the wavefield ofan array of sources. One method is simple and direct; the energy thatis radiated into the far field is calculated by integrating the directivitypattern over all directions. The other method finds the energy that isradiated into the near field. Because the medium is assumed lossless,these two energies are the same. Although the near-field method is conceptuallymore difficult, it is faster, more accurate and provides a more detaileddescription of the energy budget.</TEXT></DOC>
