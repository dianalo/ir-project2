As previously reported, AFG Industries Inc. and Wagner andamp; Brown abandoned their $2.23 billion hostile tender offer one day after GenCorp proposed to buy back as much as 54% of its shares. Amid the takeover battle, the two sides sued each other in a District Court in Columbus, Ohio.    Under the pact, GenCorp said all three litigants agreed to seek dismissal of existing actions, and said they won't bring any further litigation against one another. In addition, the two suitors agreed not to seek control of GenCorp for 10 years.    GenCorp said the agreement doesn't affect its pending lawsuit against Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which has served as investment adviser to both GenCorp and to the AFG and Wagner andamp; Brown partnership. The tire, aerospace and broadcasting concern sued Shearson earlier this month, charging that the investment banking firm had used confidential company information to assist AFG and Wagner andamp; Brown in their takeover attempt. A Shearson lawyer has said the investment bank plans to fight the lawsuit vigorously.    AFG is an Irvine, Calif.-based glass maker. Wagner andamp; Brown is a Midland, Texas oil and gas concern. </TEXT></DOC>
