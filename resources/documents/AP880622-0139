Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called the new wave of violence anattempt to destroy the Jewish state.   ``There is a wave of aggression, whether arson or murder,against the Jewish presence everywhere in the land of Israel,''Shamir told Israel army radio. ``The problem is one of survival.''   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, most businesses andschools were shut today by a general strike called for in leafletsfrom the uprising's underground leadership.   Israeli troops captured four armed Palestinian guerrillas tryingto infiltrate from south Lebanon and wounded three after a brieffirefight, the army said.   It was the 15th infiltration or attempted infiltration since theArab uprising began Dec. 8.   The army said in a statement the guerrillas planned to attackone of Israel's northern settlements. It said there were noinjuries to Israeli forces.   Israel radio said the guerrillas were captured north of Israel'sself-declared security zone and belonged to the pro-Syrian PopularFront for the Liberation of Palestine.   Also, a woman was injured when Palestinians stood in the middleof a West Bank highway and stoned a bus heading for the Jewish cityof Ariel, Israel radio reported. It said the bus also was hit by afirebomb but not set ablaze.   Police, firefighters and volunteers, backed by army helicoptersand planes, were on alert for arson. The uprising's leaders hadordered Palestinians to set fire today to Israel's farms, forestsand factories.   Eight fires erupted, and all but one of those were suspicious,police said. David Angel, spokesman for the Jewish National Fund,said that was less than the 18 average daily fires last week.   ``It's because we had so many people out looking,'' he said.   Angel said he believed the fires Wednesday were probably set orstarted by carelessness because an overnight shower and coolweather made spontaneous combusion unlikely.   The largest fire scorched 50 acres of woodlands in Mt. Gilboa,70 miles north of Jerusalem, some of it part of a reforestationprogram. The blaze began overnight.   ``You see years of work go up in smoke in a few minutes,''Avraham Yariv, head of the Gilboa regional council, told Israelradio. ``You stand helpless before this terrible sight.''   Yariv said the fire was obviously arson because it started infour places.   Angel said another blaze destroyed 10 acres of woodlands nearKfar Qassem, north of Tel Aviv. ``This was a young forest firstplanted a couple of years ago,'' he said.   The destruction of trees is especially painful to Israelis, whotake pride in having made the desert bloom. Many of the trees werebought by American Jews in memory of relatives.   Police commissioner David Krauss said the fires were set byPalestinians, some of them as young as 8 or 9.   In the past two months, fires have destroyed 35,000 acres inIsrael, much of it cherished farmland and forest, about 10 timeslast year's total.   Officials have blamed at least half the fires on the uprising,which has claimed 210 Palestinian and four Israeli lives.   The arson has brought the Arab revolt into Israel proper and hasbeen augmented by stone- and firebomb-throwing in Israeli citiesand highways.   Two female soldiers were slightly injured in separate incidentsTuesday when rocks smashed the windows of passenger trains near TelAviv and Netanya. Also, stoned smashed the windshields of two carson highways around Tel Aviv.   Some of these attacks are apparently carried out by Palestiniansworking in Israel. As many as 140,000 Arabs from the occupied landsare employed by Israelis and some live part of the time in Jewishcities.   Today's general strike was ordered in the latest in a series ofleaflets that PLO-backed resistance leaders use to communicate withthe 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whichIsrael seized during the 1967 Middle East war.   In many West Bank towns and cities, Palestinian studentsboycotted classes despite army threats to close down their schools,which were reopened last month after a four-month suspension.   The military government says it will close them again ifstudents fail to attend class regularly.   In the West Bank city of Hebron, students blocked streets withrocks and stoned Israeli troops, who fired tear gas to disperse thedemonstrators, witnesses said.</TEXT></DOC>
