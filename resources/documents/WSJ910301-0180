Oil strategists had expected crude prices to tumble to aslow as $10 a barrel after hostilities ceased. But now theydon't anticipate prices for crudes, such as West TexasIntermediate, to fall below $15 or $16 a barrel.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The war premium is gone, but now there's an uncertaintypremium,&quot; said Cyrus Tahmassebi, chief economist for AshlandOil Co.   And there's a lot to be uncertain about. It's stillunclear how long it will take Kuwaiti and Iraqi oilproduction to return to the market. The price-crash scenariohad presumed that Kuwait and Iraq would quickly try to returnto prewar production levels. But now with more than one-halfof its oil fields set ablaze by the Iraqis, there is littleprospect that Kuwait will have much input into the marketthrough the rest of this year.   Indeed, at a closed door meeting in Washington Tuesday,U.S. government officials concluded that Kuwait would be ableto pump little more than 200,000 barrels a day by year's end.Before it was invaded by Iraq in August, the tiny country wasproducing almost two million barrels daily.   And if Saddam Hussein remains in power in Iraq, sanctionsforbidding import of Iraqi oil may remain in place. It isbelieved that Iraq's refineries have been decimated by thebombing of U.S.-led coalition forces. But its oil fields,especially those in the north, may have escaped heavy damage.Thus, the Iraqis may be able to pump oil, but they may bebarred from the market. Indeed there is a move afoot in theU.S. Congress to retain the sanctions.   And even once sanctions are lifted, it will be up to warfoes Saudi Arabia and Turkey to again give Iraq access to thepipelines that stretch across their countries. Iraq, whichhas limited access to open water, has in the past used thesepipelines to move the bulk of its oil exports to shippingterminals.   Any increase in output from members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries could precipitate a tumble inprices. With OPEC output now at more than 23 million barrelsa day and anticipated second-quarter demand for its crude at21 million barrels, the stage appears to be set for adecline.   If OPEC doesn't cut production, the cartel's inventories,already voluminous, would continue to build and the price ofWest Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, woulddecline to $12 within several months, according to PhilipVerleger, a senior fellow at the Institute for InternationalEconomics in Washington.   But strategists are hoping that the cartel's members willtry to return to its prewar quota of 22.5 million barrels andsell off its hefty inventories in small increments over time.They are hoping that the cartel, when it meets March 11, willwork on a plan to divide the Iraqi and Kuwaiti quotas upamong those producers that kicked up production to replacethe lost output. Such a move, likely temporary, would atleast bridge the seasonal second-quarter slump in demand.&quot;There would be seasonal weakness but not collapse,&quot; saidLawrence Goldstein, president of Petroleum Industry ResearchFoundation.   Product inventories have been tightening and prices forproducts, as a result, have been on the rise. The loss of thesophisticated Kuwaiti refining capacity is starting to pinch.And Saudi refining output, which could have eased the growingtightness, was being gobbled up by the war. With the war nowover, the Saudis plan to start selling some of the refinedproduct they set aside for the war effort.   Refineries world-wide have been running flat out to makeup for the missing products that were widely marketed inEurope. Heating-oil markets there were so tight this winterthat U.S. marketers, in an atypical move, were net exportersof that product to Europe in January and most of this month.The U.S. could become a net exporter of certain grades ofgasoline this summer as well, experts say.   Statistics released by the American Petroleum Institutelate Tuesday show that U.S. inventories of heating oil lastweek stood at 104.6 million barrels, down from 116 millionbarrels during a similar period last year. And gasolinestocks at 227.2 million barrels were far below year-earlierlevels of 245.4 million barrels.   And although the global economy has slowed, there arestill so-called hot spots where gasoline demand has pickedup. For instance, there has been a huge surge in demand forgasoline in Germany since the reunification. Aggravating thesituation, there has been a growing number of refineriesslowing production in order to do normal maintenance.   Petroleum Argus, a London-based publication that has beentracking these so-called turnarounds, says that in Europealone product output dropped by 350,000 barrels a day thismonth because of maintenance. And in March, that number willjump to 1.08 million barrels daily.   A need for maintenance will also slow oil production atsome North Sea oil fields that produce light sweet crudes,desirable because they yield large quantities of gasoline andheating oil when refined. These refinery and oil fieldslowdowns are necessary, industry officials claim. &quot;When anyfacility runs at its limit for too long, it begins to shake,rattle and roll,&quot; said Tom Burns, manager of internationaleconomics for Chevron Corp.   In fact, crudes similar to North Sea grades have been ingreat demand and fetching the highest prices. Any slowdown inoutput of these crudes may push those prices higher. U.S.West Texas Intermediate is such a crude. Much of the crudepumped in the Middle East, yielding less of the moredesirable products, isn't of this quality. The bulk ofsurplus global inventories of crude, estimated at more than200 million barrels, is made up of lesser quality MiddleEastern crudes. Prices for some of those grades, in fact,have fallen below $15 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
