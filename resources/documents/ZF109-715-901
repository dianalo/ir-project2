 By the time you get through it all, the better part of theday has slipped away.andP;  (Many of us are now taking a laptop on vacation justto avoid this situation, much to the dismay of our significant others.)andM;And the kicker is that we really did not have to read most of themessages--certainly not at 8:00 a.m.andP;  Monday morning after a week out of theoffice.andP;  The value of many messages has, by this time, been significantlydiminished: they are electronic junk mail-- * 11/1/90  Here is the monthlysales report * 11/1/90  There are donuts on the third floor this morning *11/1/90  George called * 11/1/90  Laura had a baby boy * 11/1/90  Janiscalled * 11/1/90  Bernard Samson called * 11/1/90  Free kittens available *11/1/90  George called * 11/1/90  Acme Systems has introduced a new product *11/1/90  Tom Jackson called * 11/1/90  The Mustang with plate number B4U-G0Xhas its lights on * 11/1/90  Laura's baby looks like John * 11/2/90  Tim fromGemini called * 11/2/90  Kristina Clause called * 11/2/90  The system will bedown for upgrade on Sunday * 11/2/90  I need that market projection as soonas possible * 11/2/90  Dan's secretary called * 11/2/90  George called *11/2/90  Can I have a copy of your last presentation? * 11/2/90  Elroy fromStar Systems called * 11/2/90  Laura's Husband Peter will be mad * 11/2/90 George called * 11/2/90  Sally from the travel agency called * 11/2/90  Didyou see that last episode of Twin Peaks? * 11/2/90  For Sale--a 1968 Mustang,good condition, needs battery * 11/2/90  George called * 11/2/90  Mandatorymanagers meeting at 8:30 a.m.andP;  on MondayandM;And by the time you've gotten to the last message, about the 8:30 meeting, itis 9:15.andP;  This is not to mention that, what completely missed the requestfrom your boss for the market forecast update, the one he needs for the 8:30meeting.andM;True, the Monday after vacation is an extreme case, but the daily grind,which for many brings 100 or more messages, can be just as daunting, makingthe task of getting through your mail less of an informational experiencethan a test of stamina.andM;What if, however, when you come into the office, the first thing you see isthe request from your boss for the market projection and the meetingannouncement, both of which had been put in your Urgent folder?andP;  And themonthly sales figures are also there, as well as available from your Salesfolder.andP;  And your calls are all in one folder, except the one from Sally,because your agent knows to forward all calls from the travel agency to yoursecretary.andP;  And the request for your slides has been automatically fulfilledby your agent.andP;  And the news about Acme Systems has been forwarded to the&quot;Competiton&quot; distribution list.andP;  And most of the rest has been discarded orfiled away, except the stuff about Laura and John and Peter, which is in yourGossip file, because, after all, inquiring minds...andM;Too Much Data,andM;Too Little InformationandM;We are drowning in a sea of data.andP;  &quot;Information&quot; is coming at us from allsides.andP;  Computer output, print and broadcast news, internal and externalcommunications have all exploded, leaving us virtually defenseless.andP;  Phonemessages, voice mail, and phone tag are eating up more and more valuable timeeach day.andP;  And how do our computer systems help us?andP;  They just keep onchurning out more and more data, automating our phone calls so that we canhave more messages waiting for us each time we get our voice mail, andputting us in electronic communication with virtually everyone else who has acomputer and an E-mail system, making electronic mail the catchall forcommunications and information overflow.andM;The other side of too much data is too little information.andP;  While we try totread water in the data that we have, more important information iscontinually getting away from us, slipping through the cracks or going downthe drain.andP;  This flip side of having too much data--potentially missingcritical information or getting delayed information--is equally distressing.andO;Our business successes are more and more dependent on our quickly attainingand reacting to pertinent information.andM;This information can be in many places: electronic mail, computerconferences, news feeds, and online databases.andP;  All of these sources areexploding: according to Individual, Incorporated president Yosi Amram, fiveyears ago, there were about 400 electronic databases, and today, there areover 4,000--while our ability to deal with them grows slowly, if at all.andM;FILTERING.andP;  Based on the idea that the computer should help us deal with theflood of information that it created, a new category of software is beingdeveloped to help us deal with both sides of the equation.andP;  Over the next fewyears, filtering, the passing of a stream of information against predefinedprofiles of user interests, will quickly become a significant tool both ineliminating the nonessential and trivial information that we constantlyreceive and bringing to our attention important information that we now miss.andM;In this report, we will look at some of the concepts, technologies, andissues that surround this new area of software.andP;  We will also look at someleading-edge companies which have recently released or are about to releaseproducts based on filtering technologies.andP;  Because some of the products arenot yet on the market, we will not be able to discuss their final design asspecifically as others.andP;  Finally, we will present some of the issues that areraised by having the computer act as our agent in defining what informationwe are to see.andM;What Is Filtering?andM;As we face the information deluge, we have a number of ways to try to reachwhat is most important.andP;  We see a continuum of approaches to dealing withinformation, each of which has its place, either by itself or in combinationwith others (see Illustration 1).andM;At one end of the continuum, we have filtering.andP;  Filtering uses the computer,to the greatest degree possible, for alerting the user to the important andremoving the extraneous.andP;  This is generally done on a continual basis, withlittle intervention by the user other than to set up and fine-tune apersonalized profile.andM;In the middle, we have retrieval, which generally consists of queries runningagainst pools of information--relational or textual databases.andP;  Tools forretrieval include4GLs, customized applications, and end-user tools such asthose from Metaphor.andM;On the other end of the continuum, we find navigation.andP;  Navigation, whichallows the exploration of what is there and what is not, is completely userinitiated.andM;All along the continuum, computer power (both hardware and software) can beadded to make it easier for the user.andP;  Graphical and iconic interfaces canmake it easier for the user to navigate, while the 3-D visualization andvirtual reality technologies point to even more powerful navigationparadigms.andP;  Customized applications and object-oriented databases can makeretrieval much easier and more automatic.andP;  And the use of some of thetechniques that we will discuss below, such as the use of semistructuredfields, concept-based retrieval, and rules engines, will create a generationof filtering products that will help us focus on our true information needs.andM;AGENTS AND ALERTS.andP;  What is the difference between filters and agents?andP;  Interms of screening information, there is little practical difference.andP;  Bothcan be either active or passive--actively seeking information or passivelyremoving extraneous material.andP;  Each can alert the user or take action oninformation or launch other applications.andP;  Though some people prefer one termover the other--particularly those who like the more active connotation ofagents--we tend to see filters as a specific class of agents.andM;One of the great powers of agents or filters is to alert the user when aspecific message, piece of information, or status change is found.andP;  A keyquestion, one for which the answer is highly individualized and highlysensitive, is: How do we want to be alerted?andP;  Should we be beeped at ourdesktop, should the item pop-up on top of what we are doing, should it comein our electronic mail, or should it be filed someplace so that we can go getit when we want to?andP;  And what if it's urgent?andP;  And who defines urgent(particularly in electronic communications)?andM;These are some of the questions that the new technologies are beginning toraise.andM;Mail FilteringandM;The overflow of electronic mail was foreseen about five years ago byProfessor Thoumas Malone, director of the Center for Coordination Science atMIT.andP;  He recalls that, when he first began to talk about the problems ofreceiving too many E-mail messages, &quot;Many people looked at us as if we werecrazy, because they had never heard of E-mail.andP;  Or, if they had, theyreceived one or two messages a day.&quot;andM;The change over the past five years has been both in number of users andamount of mail processed per day.andP;  In his talks about E-mail, Maloneinformally pools the audience as to the number of regular E-mail users.andP;  Fiveyears ago, even in highly technical audiences, the number was under 40percent.andP;  Today, penetration in similar audiences has reached almost 100percent, with over 50 percent of nontechnical audiences now responding asregular mail users.andP;  And the number of daily mail messages has climbed intothe dozens.andP;  At one test site that Malone has studied, users average, on adaily basis, over 30 messages, with some reaching 100.andM;Malone sees mail traffic as increasing greatly over the near term, as afunction of more and more people using mail and of the proliferation ofgateways and the X.400 protocol, which allow users of dissimilar systems tocommunicate.andM;Malone's research originally centered on how artificial intelligence andexpert systems can be used to help people work more effectively in groups.andO;The studies soon centered on how these technologies could be used to helpusers cope with the increase of electronic mail, both in terms of filteringout the extraneous and highlighting the important.andM;Information Lens.andP;  The result of these studies was the information Lens mailfiltering system.andP;  Information Lens has been both the essential factor inshaping our understanding of how intelligence can be applied to mail-handlingand the precursor to a number of commercial products that will be released inthe coming months.andM;The two key concepts implemented in the Information Lens are the use ofsemistructured forms and the use of agents (or rules) to filter incominginformation and to get interesting information that otherwise might not havecome to the user.andM;Semistructure is the use or addition of structured fields to otherwiseunstructured information.andP;  All mail messages have some intrinsic structure:who sent it, whom it is addressed to, the date and time it was sent, thesubject field, etc.andP;  And much filtering can be done on this existingstructure.andP;  For example, I can have a rule set up to take any message from myboss, forward it to my secretary (in case I don't see it for some reason),and ut it into my Urgent folder.andP;  Or I can have a rule that takes allmessages sent to the &quot;Total Quality&quot; distribution list, and files them in myTotal Quality Folder.andM;The agents, essentially a list of rules, look at all incoming information andtake the specified actions.andP;  Typical actions involve filing messaes,responding to them, or forwardng them.andP;  Rarely does an agent actually deletea message without the user seeing it first, though sometimes the type ofmessage makes such deletion appropriate.andM;The process becomes much more powerful when additional structure is added bythe creation of specific forms or message types.andP;  A good example of this is ameeting request form.andP;  In addition to the standard message fields, a meetingrequest will generally have a meeting time, location, the chair-person, otherattendees, topic, and even an agenda.andP;  Using a meeting request form enables,for example, the filtering system to show the user meetings only on days whenhe or she is in town (and to automatically respond with regrets if the personwill be out of town), sort the meeting by topic or project for an historicalrecord, or automatically delete meeting request messages after the meetinghas already occurred.andM;The meeting request example also gives us a good instance of the differencebetween structured and unstructured information.andP;  For example, in a PLACefield of the meeting request form one could put a specific location, such asConference Room B (structured), or &quot;Don't know yet&quot; (unstructured).andP;  Thestructured entry would be more powerful because it allows an agent to look atthe Conference Room B location, reserve the conference room, reserve thecorrect AV equipment, and send out directions to the participants.andO;Unstructured text such as &quot;Don't know yet&quot; cannot easily be acted upon by theagent.andM;Anyone Server.andP;  The Information Lens also introduced a concept called theAnyone Server.andP;  This enables people to copy messages to &quot;Anyone,&quot; a defaultcc: for certain message types such as informational meetings or trip reports.andO;Users can then have their agents periodically search the Anyone Server forinformation that might be useful but was not specifically addressed to them.andO;Again using the meeting request example, a user could set up a rule thatwould look at the Anyone Server for any meetings on new accounting proceduresin the New York branch office that will take place on a Monday or Tuesday,because those are the days that he or she spends in New York.andM;A simpler example might be for a user to have the agent look at the AnyoneServer for any trip reports that concern or mention a particular client orproduct that is of interest.andM;The Anyone Server concept is part of the whole notion of the corporateKnowledge Base that we have been discussing in the Office Computing Report.andO;(This month's Knowledge Base Department is on page 17.)andP;  The Anyone Server'srole is to capture flowing information and make it accessible to others whomight have not seen it.andP;  Of course, the Anyone Server can also have its ownrules on how to deal with incoming information, and these rules could, forexample, forward specific information to designated users, making itunnecessary for their agents to go and look for it.andM;BEYOND.andP;  Beyond, Incorporated (Cambridge, Massachusetts) is a startup formedby former Lotus senior vice president Chuck Digate to implement some of theideas stemming from the Information Lens project.andP;  Early next year, thecompany will announce two products that will run atop most current LAN mailsystems.andP;  The company's core product will be a mail filtering agent, whilethe second product will be aimed at enabling mail access directly from Lotusspreadsheets.andM;Beyond's core product will initially be a client implementation that, usingthe existing mail system as transport, will provide a number of enhanced mailservices.andP;  Examples include an ASCII viewer to look at attached files and theability to launch applications from within mail in order to work withattached files.andP;  The most important enhanced services give access tosemistructured forms (such as meeting announcements and phone messages) andto rules that assist users in managing their mailbox.andP;  The enhanced servicesalso enable organizations to build both ad hoc workgroup- andcorporate-driven applications on top of the facilities.andM;By transparently running on the organization's installed mail system, theBeyond product can be implemented for many users, a few users, or even oneuser at a time.andP;  Users who continue to use their existing mail front end seeno change in their interaction with those using the Beyond mail agent ineither receiving or sending messages.andP;  Moreover, the Beyond users can use thestructured fields present in messages sent from any other mail front end--To,From, Date, Subject, cc:, etc., as well as a full-text search on the body ofthe message, to create filters and rules to increase their own productivity.andO;The design goal is to provide symmetric interoperability between the mailagent and the organization's existing environment.andM;This multimode or phased-in adoption of the product is central to Beyond'sview on how LAN-based productivity applications will enter most companies.andO;According to Digate, the company sees three phases in the adoption cycle:andM;* Initial entry as a personal productivity toolandM;* Ad hoc groups beginning to use structured messages and shared rule sets forgroup proceduresandM;* Departments or corporations developing specific tailored applicationsandM;Interestingly, this is the opposite of the approach that Lotus has taken inintroducing Notes.andP;  Lotus sees groupware as having to be introduced from thetop down to be successful (see Vol.andP;  13, No.andP;  7 for a complete discussion ofNotes and lotus's strategy).andP;  We see merit in the latter view--after all, inmost locations, electronic mail is only successful after a decree from onhigh that &quot;thou shalt read E-mail at least one a day.&quot;andP;  However, in areaswhere the infrastructure is established (and here we mean bothtechnical--mail as a transport--and sociological--mail as a primarycommunication vehicle), Beyond's view seems plausible and perhaps evencompelling.andM;Having had a sneak preview of the product, we can say that it certainly hasbeen developed with this philosophy in mind, both as a standalone personalproductivity product and a platform for group and corporate applicationdevelopment.andM;Individual Productivity.andP;  Beyond is stressing ease-of-use as a key element ingetting people to use and become comfortable with the notion and benefits ofmail-based applications.andP;  At the most basic level, the goal is to hide therules from the casual user while letting the power user devise rules using arules editor.andP;  At first look, Beyond has gone a long way to achieving thisgoal.andM;Most impressive is how easy it is to use Beyond's Rules Editor.andP;  It is likeworking with the mail messages in any system because it uses the samefamiliar forms used to create mail messages.andP;  In fact, any message can beused as the model for creating a rule--sort of a rules by example.andP;  Rules aredivided into three parts, each looking a lot like any message.andP;  The fieldsthat gerenally appear in any message are used to form the IF part of anIF/THEN statement.andP;  The IF creation is actually divided into two parts,corresponding to the standard fields of a message and the body text of themessage.andM;The first part sets conditions on the semistructured fields: if message typeis PHONE MEMO, or if FROM is George, or if TO is EDITORIAL LIST.andP;  These canbe combined using Boolean terms to create quite complex rules.andP;  The secondpart of the IF consists of locating terms in the body of the message.andP;  Again,terms can be designated under Boolean conditions for additional granularity.andO;The combination of the two sets of IF clauses creates the basic IF for therule.andM;The THEN part of the rule can be created in the third part, which appears asa separate section below the body text of the message in the Rule Editor.andO;Then actions can be typed in, if the user knows them.andP;  In addition, most THENactions are available from a pull-down Actions menu, allowing users tobrowse, choose, and then edit the action.andM;For example, the desired action for a message from my travel agent may be toforward it to my assistant who handles travel and then file it in my Travelfolder.andP;  The IF part was simply a match on my travel agent's name and companyin the WHO CALLED field.andP;  When I create the Then field, I can go to theAction menu and first choose FORWARD.andP;  The system prompts me for forwardingit, bringing up a mail directory if I desire.andP;  After choosing my secretary asthe recipient, I then again select Action and choose FILE.andP;  The system nowprompts me for the folder; it gives me a list of folders that I already haveor the option of creating a new one.andM;To help in rules management, Beyond allows the user to organize rules inRules Sets.andP;  These are groups of rules that can be turned on or off as agroup.andP;  For example, I may have a Standard rules set when I am in the office,but, when I am on the road, my needs change.andP;  I might want to have messagesfrom certain people forwarded, or I might want a certain response mailed backto some other people: &quot;I am away until the 4th.&quot;andP;  There is alsoinformation--cookies and cars with lights on--that I want to avoid.andP;  Beyondallows me to add an Away set of rules that I can turn on when I leave,turning off the Standard set.andM;Rules Sets also help manage different types of information: one specific ruleset might handle Bug Reports forms.andP;  Multiple Rules Sets can be run at thesame time.andM;Beyond is going beyond just mailbox management for personal productivity.andO;For example, using a simple rule, users can manage their To-Do list.andP;  Therule is based on the concept of a tickler file, where items are filed underthe date that you want to deal with them.andP;  When that date comes, you eitherdeal with the item or defer it to a later date.andM;Beyond users can take any message, even a self-generated one, and &quot;tickle&quot; itwith a certain wake-up date.andP;  When the date arrives, the item is put in theTo-Do folder.andP;  At any time, the user can search the Tickler folder for futureTo-Dos.andM;The Tickler function could be made much more complex by adding rules thatlooked at the message sender, subject, etc.andP;  And some users may do just that.andO;However, the Tickler Rule, unadorned, is a good example of how powerful evensimple rules can be.andM;Group Productivity.andP;  The next step in Beyond's vision is building groupproductivity applications.andP;  Beyond's view of groups centers less on definedgroups (those found on an organization chart, according to Digate) than onthe ad hoc groups that come together over a project or process.andP;  Beyond feelsthat its bottoms-up focus is better suited to the fluid way that groups areactually formed and operate than is the top-down approach.andM;Beyond's group productivity applications are generally based on users makinguse of specific, customizable forms or message types.andP;  Examples of groupsapplications are phone messages and meeting announcements.andM;Phone message types are best used when one or more people take phone messagesfor others.andP;  The forms typically look a lot like the popular pink phonemessage slips that are so common in many offices.andP;  The sender fills out theappropriate fields and check-boxes.andP;  The receiver's system can then processthe messages using the fields.andP;  For example, I might wan messages marked forme to call someone back to be put into a Call Back folder, or messages fromcertain people to be forwarded, as in the travel agent example above.andM;Meeting requests are generally based on a form that requires the meetingorganizer to enter the data, time, place, subject, agenda, attendees, etc.andO;The receiver can then set up automatic Response rules for busy dates orautomatic Delete rules for meetings that have already occurred.andM;In addition to the forms provided by Beyond, such as phone messages andmeeting requests, forms can be customized for a specific group.andP;  These can bedesigned and shared by end users.andM;Corporate Applications.andP;  Beyond sees its long-term opportunity as providing aplatform for building corporate applications.andP;  This will certainly requirepeople to use the more advanced features of the product, such as more complexrules and the ability to get data from other sources.andM;One example of a corporate application is that of automating the processingof travel expense reports.andP;  The traveler fills out a travel expense form thatcan be designed to look a lot like the existing corporate form.andP;  The form issent to a specific person whose mail agent has a Rule Set to handle thismessage type.andP;  The rules can look at various aspects of the form--thetraveler's name, department, amount spent, etc.andP;  The rules can also look upwhether the amount spent requires additional authorization or can beforwarded to accounting for processing.andP;  If the amount is over the amountspecified, the form could be forwarded to the traveler's department manager.andM;A second corporate application example engages both the company and itscustomers.andP;  This application involves the automatic mailing of productinformation from a supplier to a retailer.andP;  For example, a retail toy storemay desire the most recent product list and prices from its bicycle supplier.andO;Specifically, it wants the tricycle list.andP;  The retailer sends a mail messagewhich includes the type of product and the type of information desired (thiscould even be all done in the Subject or Text fields of a standard messagewithout a custom form).andP;  The supplier's mail agent processes the message.andO;The result is a message response of &quot;Thank you for your inquiry...&quot; with anattachment of the files containing the proper information that the retailercan either view or print out.andP;  The agent could alternatively fax the productinformation to the retailer's various branch stores.andM;@Mail.andP;  When it announces its mail agent product early next year, Beyond willalso announce a Lotus 1-2-3 (and Symphony) add-in that allows users todirectly access mail from within the spreadsheet.andP;  Based on the (very true)assumption that many 1-2-3 users never leave 1-2-3, or at least do so onlyunder the greatest pressure, the product, named @Mail, will allow them toaccess their in-box without ever leaving 1-2-3.andM;@Mail will present the user with an in-box identical to Beyond's core mailagent product.andP;  It will support the same mail systems as the core product.andM;@Mail will provide three specific capabilities:andM;* The ability to send messages and to receive messages and alerts from within1-2-3 and SymphonyandM;* The ability for users to send the worksheet they're working on whilecollaborating with others on the modeling or interpreting of the spreadsheet,and the ability for the recipient to retrieve the worksheet instantly uponreceipt of the mail messageandM;* Support for data-driven messaging--the ability to generate a messageautomatically, based, for example, on the value of a particular cell in thespreadsheetandM;This last capability can be very powerful as both an individual alerting tooland a tool for group updating and collaboration.andP;  We are very excited by theemergence of data-driven applications, as we noted last month (Vol.13, No.andO;10, News Analysis Department) in our analysis of Pilot Executive Software'sLightShip.andM;Beyond seems to have a very coherent vision of both adoption patterns andproduct cocept.andP;  This can be summed up in Digate's comment that he hopes thatthe success of adding mail capabilities into 1-2-3 will greatly increase mailtraffic, making his mail agent even more appealing.andM;AGILITY SYSTEMS.andP;  Agility Systems (Waltham, Massachusetts) was formed byformer Cullinet executive vice president John Landry, who is chairman ofAgility, and Tom Malone, who sits on the board of directors, to commerciallyimplement the Information Lens concepts.andP;  Thus, many of Agility's ideas aresimilar to Beyond's, but the emphasis is quite different.andM;Agility emphasizes the server agent side of the Lens model.andP;  The AnyoneServer has been extended to a set of active agents that go out to bothinternal and external information sources and return the desired data to therequesting user.andP;  While in-box management is important to Agility (and theupcoming Agility product uses all of the semistructure and rules facilitiesenvisioned in the Information Lens), mail is but one of the many informationsources that the user requires.andM;Agility's product, to be announced late this year, has a three-tierarchitecture.andP;  At the top, there is all the information that the user needs,information that is in news feeds, electronic mail, dial-up data services,mainframe databases, etc.andP;  In the middle is the Lens-like server.andP;  Itreceives requests from users and goes out to the information sources, tryingto fill them.andP;  It then returns the information to the user.andP;  At the bottom isthe user, sending requests and receiving responses, as well as normal mailtraffic.andP;  The user has one or more agents that process the incominginformation (generally based on message type) and put it into the appropriatefolder or take other specified action.andM;User information requests to the server will initially be made to a specificsource--e.g., Dow Jones, CompuServe, a McCormack andamp; Dodge General Ledger,etc.--using a specified form for each.andP;  According to Landry, the systemshould eventually be able to take a generic request and determine the bestplace to get the information.andM;While we have not had a chance to spend much time with the system, which isstill in development, or to get many of the specifics of the final design, wedo know that it will run over existing mail systems.andP;  The server will run ona DOS PC under Windows (eventually also running under OS/2), while theclients will be Windows based.andP;  The application will support Windows DynamicData Exchange (DDE) and Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) to allow them to beintegrated with other Windows applications.andM;Agility is aiming its product more at information-intensive needs than atcasual users, though the company does believe that such a product willundergo incremental adoption rather than be brought into companies all atonce.andP;  Its broad vision of the intersection of all types of information at asingle point is potentially very powerful.andP;  Agility's challenge is to makeall this functionality easily accessible to the user, and, in fact, toexplain and demonstrate to users the benefits of agents and semistructure.andM;News FilteringandM;Of the various streams of information, the flow of news from providers suchas Dow-Jones and Reuters has caught the most attention of those trying tofilter it and bring it to the desktop.andP;  One reason for this is that it isrelatively easy to get a news feed--they are available from the provider andcan be received via FM radio broadcast or wide area network.andM;The initial thrust of news filtering has been to provide instant alerts tothose who need to react to news events immediately.andP;  In addition, people arenow looking at filtering news feeds as a way to do basic research and toupdate in a timely manner many people whose jobs do not require instantnotification.andM;WAYS TO FILTER NEWS.andP;  There are a number of ways to filter any stream ofinformation, and the ways that several companies have chosen to implementnews filters are representative of the four major approaches.andP;  The fourapproaches, each described below, are:andM;* Keyword match, with or without Boolean expressions--see &quot;Desktop Data&quot; and&quot;Reuters/Lotus Notes&quot;andM;* Structure- or semistructure-based, a very similar approach to the mailfiltering--see &quot;Agility&quot;andM;* Concept-based filtering or retrieval--see &quot;Verity&quot;andM;* Relevance feedback--see &quot;Individual, Incorporated&quot;andM;Keyword Match.andP;  Keyword or key-phrase atching has been the basis of oursearching of text databases, particularly online dial-up services, for manyyears.andP;  It is based on matching strings of text, and can be implementedeither against pre-indexed systems or, in a brute force approach, asfull-text search.andP;  It can also be run against a stream of text, where it isgenerally called a profile.andM;The major problem with keyword profiles is that they can bring in a lot moreinformation than a user wants.andP;  For example, if I designate &quot;digital&quot; as akeyword, I will not only get hits on any story about Digital Equipment, butalso about digital audiotape (DAT), digital watches, and every closing marketreport that happens to mention Digital, the last being useful to marketwatchers, but much less so to technology or product watchers.andM;In order to provide more precision for the user, keyword matching is oftensupplemented with Boolean search expressions such as AND, OR, and NOT.andP;  Thisallows the user to specify &quot;digital&quot; AND NOT &quot;market update,&quot; to eliminatesome of the &quot;noise.&quot;andM;A second problem with keyword matching, which is the opposite of the first,is the chance of missing information that does not exactly match the profile.andO;There are two dimensions to this issue: words that are similar but are notexact matches, and words that have the same meaning but are not matches,i.e., synonyms.andM;To solve the first dimension, many search engines can actually look at theword root and handle all instances of it.andP;  Thus, the keyword &quot;technology&quot;would also pick up &quot;technologies,&quot; which is not a direct match.andP;  Thisdictionary approach corresponds to the thesaurus approach that some systemshave implemented to deal with synonyms.andP;  With such a synonym list, thekeyword &quot;IBM&quot; would also match &quot;International Business Machines&quot; and possibly&quot;Big Blue.&quot;andM;Dictionaries and thesauruses are also used with the other filteringtechniques.andP;  In fact, as we shall see below, very few of the techniques arepure; virtually all the products discussed below use at least some part oftwo or more.andM;Semistructure.andP;  As with mail, the filtering of semistructured fields inincoming news can be very powerful.andP;  While news is often cited as completelyunstructured text, and, indeed, most of the filtering is done on the text,there are some inherent fields that can be used--date, time, location, newssource.andP;  There are also other fields that are added by the news provider.andO;For example, Dow-Jones DowVision provides 55 fields including ticker symbol,standard industry code (SIC), most active stocks, and a variety of topic andsubject fields, as well as the editors to whom this story is addressed.andO;(There is, unfortunately, no cross-vendor standard for these fields.andO;Separate filters would have to be developed for each vendor's informationfeeds.)andM;These fields, and similar ones from other sources, can be used to filter outthe extraneous (&quot;most active at 1:00 p.m.&quot;) and point to the most appropriate(IBM and &quot;for technical editors,&quot; to be alerted to an IBM productannouncement).andP;  While this is not sufficient in itself, when coupled withfull-text filtering, or, even better, concept-based filtering, it can be veryuseful and much more efficient than text searches alone.andM;Concept-Based.andP;  Concept-based filtering is really content-based or conceptretrieval applied to a stream of text, in this case, news feeds.andP;  Accordingto Verity, a leading proponent of the technology, concept retrieval is anintelligent system for retrieving documents that goes beyond text-stringmatching and Boolean searches.andM;Concept retrieval assumes that not all of a user's search terms are createdequal and not all of the hits against those terms are equally valuable to theuser.andP;  The system weighs the hits to see which is most relevant--in thesimplest case, a document that hits many of the search terms is more relevantthan a document that hits only one.andP;  Some systems, such as Verity's Topic,take this a step further by allowing the user to put values on the searchterms to further fine-tune the process.andM;For example, I might be interested in multimedia.andP;  Certain terms go into myprofile: multimedia, CD-ROM, video, audio, computers, etc.andP;  For me,multimedia and CD-ROM are more important than the other terms, so I woulddesignate them with a higher value.andP;  Computers might get a medium value, andvideo and audio, whose articles generally refer to the entertainmentindustry, get low values.andP;  Articles matching multimedia and/or CD-ROM wouldcome out on top of a relevancy list.andP;  Articles with only video or audio wouldbe at the bottom.andP;  Articles with only computers would be in the middle.andP;  Andarticles with computers and video or computers and audio would be in theupper middle, just where they should be.andM;We should note that this weighting is different from word counting, whichweights documents by the number of times a word occurs, not in how meaningfulthe word is.andP;  An article with the word &quot;video&quot; occurring 100 times and withno other terms occurring is probably just as valuable to me as an article inwhich the word &quot;video&quot; appeared only once with no other terms occurring.andO;(For another example, see Illustration 2.)andM;Concept retrieval holds a lot of promise both as a technology in itself andin association with other technologies.andP;  For example, Verity's Topic systemcan be used to first filter news by looking at the semistructured fields andthen look at and rank the content.andP;  Conceptually, this process could bereversed, allowing us to overcome the problem that there are no standardfields for news dissemination.andP;  Using the concept engine on the text andignoring the vendor's field designation, the filter could create values in astandard set of fields, such as subject.andP;  The document could then be filteredbased on a company's &quot;standard&quot; fields.andM;We at the Office Computing Group are very interested in concept- orcontent-based retrieval as one of the enablers for a Knowledge Base.andP;  Conceptretrieval will be discussed further in an upcoming Knowledge Base Department.andM;Relevance Feedback.andP;  Relevance feedback implies an interactive relationshipbetween the user and the provider, be that provider a human or an activeagent.andP;  Using one or more of the techniques discussed above, a stream of datais filtered using a user- or user/provider-developed filter.andP;  The idea is touse an initial profile and modify it to get closer and closer to what theuser really wants.andM;With a service such as Individual Incorporated's, the user lets the providerknow which items were the most and least userful.andP;  The provider keepsmodifying the profile to make it more &quot; relevant&quot; to the user's needs.andP;  Aperfect match--everything highly relevant--is not really desirable, as such aprofile is likely to be too narrow and has probably missed something ofsignificance.andM;While the technology to completely automate this process does not yet exist,it is interesting to speculate on how active agents could serve in thismanner.andP;  For example, rather than having the user fill out the relevancyforms, a task which may soon become tiresome, the agent could monitor whichitems the user immediately deletes, which are saved, which are forwarded,which are printed, etc.andP;  Using this information, the agent could revise theprofile, as does the human agent.andP;  The agent could also go off to othersources and look for similar information.andP;  Finally, the agent might presentsome information that does not match the profile, but may be the next logicalsubject that the person will reach.andP;  For example, an interest in multimediaand networking may lead to the capture of some information on tariffs that aregional phone company applied for that could lead to transmitting videoacross common copper phone lines.andM;These last ideas lead us to that third, darkest area of our knowledge--whatwe don't know is there.andP;  Helping us here is the ultimate promise of all ofthese systems (see &quot;Understanding Information,&quot; page 15).andM;DESKTOP DATA.andP;  Desktop Data (Waltham, Massachusetts) is the first company tospecialize in delivering and filtering live news feeds on the desktop.andP;  Whileother products have been available to receive news feeds into a PC and dosome filtering and retrieval (some are available from the news providersthemselves), Desktop Data's product, NewsEDGE, is the first to provide theseabilities on multiple incoming news feeds from multiple news providers,including Dow Jones, PR Newswire, and many more.andM;NewsEDGE is initially aimed at those professionals for whom immediatenotification of events is essential, sort of the corporate and financialindustry equivalent to stock, bond, and commodities price-watchers.andP;  Theavailability of multiple news feeds assures these people, many of whom are inbusinesses that require instantaneous response to changing situations, thatthey receive the first reports from the first news services that send them.andO;Imagine the advantage that an oil company had in knowing of the Iraqiinvasion of Kuwait just a few minutes before its competition, or the lessdramatic but equally important advantage to the soy bean trader who gets newsof a sudden hail storm in a key farming locality ahead of other traders.andM;However, not all businesses need to be sensitive to news at this level.andO;Desktop Data is also targeting companies that need to be alerted to news in areasonable time (a reasonable time being defined as somewhere betweenimmediately and reading it in tomorrow's Wall Street Journal).andP;  Thesecompanies do not generally require all of the news wires; two or three may besufficient.andM;Desktop Data is, therefore, attempting to develop a second market, whereimmediacy is less critical than making sure the data is received and gets tothe correct person, or is retrievable in a reasonable time.andP;  As we shall seebelow, the company is in the process of redesigning the product for multiuserenvironments to address these new users.andM;Using NewsEDGE/PC.andP;  NewsEDGE/PC, Desktop Data's first product, was introducedabout a year ago.andP;  The product can operate in either the background orforeground, running on a standalone DOS PC.andP;  The background operation allowsthe user to run other applications while the PC receives the incoming datafrom an FM wide-band receiver.andP;  The user can be alerted to important incomingnews by a window that pops up on top of the foreground application.andP;  The usercan look at a news item without leaving his or her primary application.andM;NewsEDGE/PC running in the foreground provides the user with a scrollingdisplay of incoming news items.andP;  The user can see either the full incomingnews or the items that match a specific profile.andP;  Items matching a profile(i.e., alerts) beep when they appear and have a profile code next to them.andM;Profiles and Searches.andP;  NewsEDGE/PC filters news by way of one or moreuser-defined profiles.andP;  These profiles contain a list of keywords or phrasesentered by the user.andP;  An incoming news story that contains any of thekeywords will be an alert on the main screen and will be seen in the view ofthat specific profile.andP;  Users may have multiple profiles (up to 16), and newsitems may appear in multiple profile views.andM;Users can &quot;clip&quot; any relevant news stories into their own clippings database,which remains even after the incoming news database is purged.andP;  Purging isdone automatically on a first-in, first-out basis.andP;  A typical news databasewill have an inventory of one to six weeks.andM;NewsEDGE also contains a search facility, which lets the user search eitherthe live news database or the clippings database for information that mighthave been missed or needs to be recalled.andP;  This facility has a fairlycomplete use of Boolean operators, including AND, OR, NOT, and nestedsearches.andP;  &quot;Related Stories&quot; searches provide AI-based searches to find morestories that are similar to a specific story.andM;In the original release of the product, the searching power was not extendedto the profiles filtering incoming news.andP;  The profiles did not have anyBoolean operators (other than OR), making it difficult for users to reach thecorrect level of precision.andP;  According to Desktop Data president Don McLagan,the company has shipped Release 1.3 of NewsEDGE/PC, which enables users tocontrol their profiles better with the addition of more Boolean capabilities.andM;A Client/Server Approach.andP;  NewsEDGE/PC is a standalone PC product.andP;  DesktopData is about to release two new versions of the product, one that implementsa client/server architecture on a LAN, and another that uses a PC server toput news feed directly on a mainframe for dissemination through E-mail andEIS software.andM;NewsEDGE/LAN separates the receipt and filtering of incoming news from thedisplay of stories on the client workstation.andP;  The server, a 386 sitting on aNovell, 3Com, Microsoft, or IBM network, receives the feeds and runs themagainst up to 1,000 profiles.andP;  The client is a DOS character mode or Windows3.0 application, the latter allowing users to keep a news window open tomonitor the incoming news.andP;  News can be brought into other Windowsapplications through either DDE or the Windows clipboard.andM;NewsEDGE/Server is designed to deliver the news feeds into electronic mail orexecutive information systems through connection to a mainframe.andP;  Users cansend their profiles to the NewsEDGE/Server via their electronic mail systemand then automatically receive stories that match in their mail in-box.andM;New Alliances.andP;  Desktop Data's initial success has come from its ability toform strong industry alliances--specifically with competing news andinformation providers.andP;  The company is currently expanding its partners, thistime with emphasis not on the new procurement side, but on the delivery side.andO;Desktop Data is currently working with Pilot Executive Software and IBM tobring its news filtering capabilities into their respective executiveinformation systems.andP;  The IBM relationship will probably lead to integratingNewsEDGE into PROFS and Office Vision.andP;  In addition, Desktop Data isnegotiating with Soft-Switch to enable wide area routing of the news feedsinto users' electronic mail boxes.andP;  And there is even work going on withLotus to bring Desktop Data's real-time notification into Lotus Notes.andM;REUTERS/LOTUS NOTES.andP;  We initially looked at the Reuters news feeds intoLotus Notes in our report on Notes (Vol.andP;  13, No.andP;  7).andP;  In terms offiltering, it is much like the Desktop Data products, although Booleancapabilities have been built in from the beginning.andP;  Users fill out profiles,and the system looks for &quot;hits&quot; against the profile.andP;  Users then receive thepiece of information in their electronic mail.andP;  Users do not receivereal-time notification of incoming news matching their profile; however, ifthey are running Notes under OS/2, they can be beeped when new mail arrives.andM;Notes takes this news-filtering paradigm a step further by putting it intodisplayable databases.andP;  These databases are like any other Notes database.andO;They can be viewed by more than one person at the same time.andP;  They also canbe customized to allow multiple views of the information.andM;This is useful when different people need to see different aspects of thenews.andP;  For example, the sae news database may contain views by industry,keyword, company, product, or others.andP;  The Notes application examines theincoming news and fills in the fields that allow the user to view it by thevarious aspects.andP;  Thus, an item with the word &quot;computer&quot; in it could havethat term added to its keyword list, while a second item with the word&quot;Lotus&quot; could have the terms &quot;Software&quot; and &quot;Lotus&quot; added to the industry andcompany fields, and &quot;computer&quot; added to its keyword list.andM;One user could then view the database by keywords, looking for anything to dowith computers, while another views it by industry, concentrating onsoftware.andP;  They both would see the second piece on Lotus, while the item oncomputers that did not mention Lotus would not be seen by the personinterested in the software industry.andM;Lotus is currently negotiating with news vendors to supplement the Reutersfeeds, in addition to working with Desktop Data to help provide real-timealerts.andM;News feeds was one of the applications that initially excited the early Notesadopters.andP;  The initial release is just now being delivered, and we will soonknow a lot more technically and conceptually about how this type ofapplication works with other Notes-based applications.andM;AGILITY SYSTEMS.andP;  We look at Agility primarily as a mail-base companyproducing mail-enabled applications.andP;  However, as we noted above, the companyis making a strong effort to integrate external information sources such asnews feeds with internal mail.andP;  Once its implementation is complete, itshould provide an example of the semistructured filtering approach to newsfeeds.andM;VERITY.andP;  Verity (Mountain View, California), as we noted above, is one of thechief proponents of content-based or concept retrieval.andP;  Its Topic serverruns on a large number of platforms, including VMS, OS/2, and Unix, with DOS,OS/2, Unix, VMS, and Macintosh clients supported.andP;  The servers engine can beused with Topic's front-end search application or as the basis for buildingcustomized applications.andM;Topic Real-Time.andP;  Topic Real-Time applies the Topic concept engine to astream of news (currently Dow-Jones DowVision, Reuters, and Comtex Scientificare supported).andP;  Users create topics for use as filters (see Illustration 2).andO;When the news feed comes in, filtering is first done on the structuredfields, then on the text or a combination of text and field contents.andP;  Hitsare then, through either electronic mail or a Topic front end, presented tothe user in weighted order, the most relevant first.andP;  Users can specifyrelevance thresholds to limit the amount of information sent or displayed.andM;INDIVIDUAL, INCORPORATED.andP;  Individual, Incorporated (Cambridge,Massachusetts) is using filtering technology to play the role of &quot;informationrefiner.&quot;andP;  The company serves as a middleman between information providersand information consumers.andP;  It figuratively takes the raw, crude data frommultiple sources and, through an intelligent agent, refines it intohigh-octane information that is specifically relevant to the subscriber'sinterest.andM;The key term is relevance.andP;  According to Individual president Yosi Amram, thenotion of the agent is not as a fixed filter.andP;  Rather, it is tied to the ideaof relevance feedback, where the subscriber, on an ongoing basis, tells thatfiltering agent what is relevant and what is not.andM;The process is as follows: The company customizes a filter for thesubscriber.andP;  This filter is essentially a first stab at determining thesubscriber's interests.andP;  Multiple feeds (over 5,000 stories per day) are runagainst this profile using a software design known as the SMART System,developed by Gerard Salton at Cornell University, as the active filteringagent.andM;Every week, the subscriber receives a report card listing all of the storiessent during that week (after the first month or so, report cards aretypically sent out once a month, as the search profile becomes better attunedto the subscriber's interests).andP;  The subscriber marks each one as Relevant orNot Relevant, or Question Mark if the user does know or is not sure.andP;  Theseresponses are then fed back into the agent to achieve more precision (seeIllustration 3).andM;According to Amram, Individual shoots for a 70 percent to 80 percentrelevancy level, which is generally achieved after one or two iterations ofthe user feedback.andP;  He notes that the user would not want to get 100 percentrelevancy because he or she would likely be missing some additional relevantmaterial and also would not be able to learn about new areas of interest.andM;The whole process is aimed at picking up 5 or 10 relevant stories that theuser might have otherwise missed.andP;  Individual claims the process to be bothmore attuned to the subscriber's needs (because of the feedback mechanism) aswell as less expensive than getting all of the information from all of thefeeds and then filtering it internally.andP;  The axiom in the informationindustry is that users pay by the amount of data actually sent to them,whether it is useful or not.andM;The relevant items are sent by Individual to its subscribers via electronicmail or fax.andP;  Interestingly, the company has been surprised that thepercentage of users desiring E-mail over fax is much higher than had beenanticipated.andP;  The delivery is not real-time; stories are received by thecustomer once a day.andP;  Thus, the service does not really compete withreal-time information feeds for those who need instantaneous alerts.andM;In fact, a service such as Individual's may be more complementary to thancompetitive with the other products we have described.andP;  For example, acombination of Individual's service and a mail filtering system such asBeyond's, which would allow the user to sort the incoming items and triggeractions off them, would be very powerful.andP;  And Individual's feeds are alreadyreceived internally at Lotus, where they are put into a Notes database fordistribution and retrieval.andM;Individual does not claim to be the sole source of information.andP;  The companycertainly does not suggest that its customers give up reading the Wall StreetJournal or its real-time feeds for those who need them.andP;  Rather, its serviceis best viewed as a supplement to the standard sources of information.andM;(See Vol.andP;  2, No.andP;  7 of Paradigm Shift, our audio newsletter, for a fullinterview with Yosi Amram on the Dynamics of Information.)andM;Database Filtering.andP;  While most of the current work is focused on filteringmail and news feeds, there is a tremendous amount of information locked intoour more structured databases.andP;  This information is generally accessible onlythrough difficult 4GLs or through specific applications built by databasespecialists.andM;We would like to be notified when certain information comes into a databasewithout having to learn the query language or have applications built for us.andO;In fact, we probably don't care where this information is coming from, and wewant to be able to use the same profiling tools, as well as the sameprofiles, to go against this type of data.andM;Conceptually, there are a number of ways that this could occur.andP;  First, datacould be captured and filtered as it is entered into the database.andP;  Second,we can run our filters as queries against the databases, specifically thetext fields.andP;  This could either be done on an ad hoc basis or on a scheduledbasis that looks just at the material added or altered since the last query.andO;The latter method, which is more in the spirit of filtering, is sometimescalled semi-automatic filtering.andM;One way of implementing these approaches is to create specific interfacesbetween the forms that handle filtering--the profiles and specific datastructures.andP;  Thus, a term or field in a form that sorts incoming E-mail intofolders could be creating SQL queries when run against a database.andM;Another approach to solving this problem is to integrate the two searchtechnologies, bringing unstructured or fuzzy capabilities to structureddatabases.andP;  Digital plans to integrate content-based retrieval (CBR) into itsrelational database technology, allowing the content of the text fields to beused as triggers to other events, such as filling in certain data in thestructured fields.andP;  It could also activate agents that could notify the userof a profile hit.andM;This concept leads us to the ultimate approach, that of the object-orienteddatabase.andP;  If capabilities such as CBR are integrated into objects asmethods, the object could monitor itself for changes, run the changes againstCBR-based profiles, consult a rules engine, and take the appropriate action,such as sending a mail message to a specific person or distribution list.andO;Except for the profiles, all this would be built in.andP;  The profiles would bestored separately and could be used for multiple purposes--mail, news, andonline database query--and the rules would be stored and be available in thesame way.andM;The exciting part of the ability to run the same filter against mail, news,and external and internal databases is that it finally begins to get us to auser-centric information system.andM;Digital's &quot;Office of the Future&quot;andM;At this year's DECworld, Digital Equipment Corporation provided a glimpseinto how these technologies will be integrated and used in a section of theexhibit called &quot;The Office of the Future.&quot;andP;  A number of technologies werehighlighted, including electronic mail filtering, real-time news filtering,and content-based retrieval (CBR).andP;  While not announcing any specificproducts, Digital was able to give the most comprehensive vision of how thesetechnologies will work with the office environment.andM;For Digital, these are not separate technologies or individual applications.andO;Rather, they are seen as services that users and developers need in order tocustomize and personalize their information systems.andP;  For example, Digitalplans to include Content-Based Retrieval as a standard NAS (NetworkApplication Service) offering, similar to its SQL Services for relationaldatabases.andP;  Likewise, mail filtering will most likely be included as anessential part of a future office offering, rather than as a standaloneapplication.andM;Digital is building these services, using both its own development and thetechnologies of others.andP;  The company is one of the supporters of MIT's Centerfor Coordination Science and has licensed the Lens technology, which is themodel for its mail filtering service.andP;  It is implementing both the client andserver agents from the Information Lens model.andM;However, Digital is taking this model one step further by addingcontent-based retrieval to its mail filtering.andP;  Mail will be first filteredby using the semistructured fields and the rules base.andP;  Then CBR can beapplied to the message field (or the semistructured fields, if desired) toachieve a finer granularity and prioritization based on content.andP;  And, withCBR aware of Digital's Compound Document Architecture (CDA), attachmentscould also be filtered.andP;  According to Dennis Saloky, engineering developmentmanager for information visualization at Digital, the CBR engine can evenfilter by the text within a pie chart.andM;Digital's CBR implementation will be based on Verity's engine, though Digitalwill write its own user interface and is adding object-oriented programminginterfaces to the engine.andP;  Digital believes that the programming interfacesare at least as important as the user interface since, as a service, CBRshould be transparent to the user.andP;  Digital is also concentrating on addingadditional intelligence to the engine.andP;  It has added its own parser, whichwill support 10 languages at first release, and is working on addingadditional linguistic capabilities to allow even finer searches.andP;  An exampleof this is adding the ability to parse by &quot;part of speech,&quot; with the resultthat a search of a legal database looking for information on &quot;wills&quot; wouldonly hit on &quot;will&quot; as a noun, not as a verb.andM;Among the systems vendors, Digital seems to have a lead in implementingfilters and content-based retrieval.andP;  It also seems to have a lead in thevision of how these technologies should fit into the office environment, botharchitecturally (through NAS) and conceptually, as the embodiment ofDigital's expanded definition of Office.andP;  According to Howard Webber, managerof Advanced Development and Strategic Planning for Digital's Business andOffice Information Systems, &quot;Office is best defined as a state of circulatinginformation.&quot;andM;Issues in FilteringandM;While the emerging filtering technologies and products hold much promise inhelping us cope with the flood of information we face each day, they areraising a number of key issues, issues which are more personal andorganizational than technological in nature.andM;The ones of most concern to us include:andM;* How will people actually use these technologies?andM;* How will these technologies affect the organization?andM;* How will these technologies affect our understanding of information?andM;USING FILTERS.andP;  We do not yet have enough information on how users will usefiltering agents (or even whether a majority of them will use them at all).andO;The most important factors seem to be: how useful the filter is, howcustomizable and sensitive it is, how much additional work the user must doto make it useful, and whether or not users will trust the system.andM;In terms of usefulness of mail filters, an interesting (and, according toMalone, unexpected) result has emerged from the MIT studies on theInformation Lens test sites: There are essentially two types of users offiltering technology.andM;The first type--the only type originally envisioned by the MIT team--uses aset of rules to filter information as it comes in and to sort the messagesinto the appropriate folders.andP;  This group, called &quot;prioritizers&quot; by WendyMackay, one of Malone's students who studied uses of the Information Lens, ismostly concerned with getting past (or, in some cases, getting rid of) theunimportant or redundant and immediately focusing on the most crucial items.andM;The second group, termed &quot;archivers&quot; by Mackay, first views all of theincoming messages and then uses the agents to file and store for laterretrieval.andP;  These people seem to want to get more information and to be ableto easily find it again when needed.andM;There are also some people who take on the characteristics of each group atdifferent times.andP;  They, for instance, might be more ruthless about applyingpre-sorting rules when the incoming information just gets to be too much,such as at very busy times or right after being away from the office for along period of time.andM;The point is that the question of usefulness can be a very personal one, andthe answer can change as other conditions change.andP;  Thus, the challenge inmaking the software useful is to make it powerful and flexible enough to beused in a number of ways, but, at the same time, make it simple enough not tointerfere with the user.andM;The second element determining usage, sensitivity, stems from thecustomizability issue, though it is not exactly the same.andP;  Whilecustomizability deals with making the application work as the user works,sensitivity is a measure of how finely the user can tune the filter to let alower or higher volume of information come through.andP;  With news feedsapplications in particular, users sometimes find that they are getting muchmore than they bargained for and that there is just too much new informationbeing added daily (or minute by minute) for them to be able to consume it.andM;The ability of users to easily modify and raise and lower the granularity asneeded is essential for the widespread adoption of these technologies.andP;  Thisis especially true of the early period, when users are getting over thelearning curve, which is the make-or-break time for many products.andP;  Forexample, the high start-up costs and initial learning curve have keptpersonal information managers (which, after all, mail and informationfiltering agents are) from being widely used.andM;As user move towards more group-oriented applications, and particularly asthey are required to use more structured forms, the issue arises of how muchadditional work they are willing to do.andP;  Users who are accustomed to the&quot;freedom&quot; of unstructured communications may react negatively to decidingwhich form or message-type to use in a given situation.andP;  And users who haveused their in-box as a large dumping ground and storage bin for any and allinformation may not feel that setting up folders for each activity orpriority is worthwhile.andM;Finally, there is the question of whether users will trust an agent-basedsystem.andP;  Will they be too afraid of missing something important orinteresting to let the filters work as they should?andP;  Will they useagent-based applications as a supplement to their current procedures, or willthey feel the system is an all-or-nothing proposition?andM;ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTS.andP;  Filtering technologies are likely to affect ourorganizations in three ways.andP;  The first will be essentially procedural.andO;Filters will automate, clarify, and eventually change the way certaininformation is handled.andP;  For example, the travel expense applicationdiscussed above, while initially automating the exact procedures that werepreviously followed, is likely, over a period of time, to cause or facilitatethe changing of the procedures themselves.andP;  The changes would probablystreamline the process, such as substituting database lookup for supervisor'ssignatures at various steps.andM;The second effect will be in the area of paths of communications and access.andO;We have already seen that basic electronic mail can help to flattenorganizations by providing means for individual workers to communicate withthe executive levels.andP;  The use of agents and the empowerment this gives bothto the individuals and the organization will most likely result in new formsof power within that organization.andP;  This power will be based on the abilityto use the new lines of communication effectively to pursue one's own or agroup's agenda.andP;  Access will be less through the door to the executive suitethan through the increasingly complex and powerful communications system.andM;The third effect will also provide the opportunity for changes in theorganization's power structure, with this power concentrated in those who canbest use the new tools to obtain, process, and act upon the increased amountof information that can now be accessed.andP;  This will be true both for thosereceiving and using external information about customers, competitors, theeconomy, etc., and also for those with access to more internal informationthrough such implementations as the Anyone Server.andP;  The individuals and teamsthat can leverage the knowledge and work which already exist in theorganization--and which may heretofore have been buried or&quot;departmentalized&quot;--can move forward much more quickly.andM;UNDERSTANDING INFORMATION.andP;  We are just beginning to understand the role andvalue of information in and among our organizations.andP;  As filtering technologylets us get at information in different ways, we increase this understandingand our ability to effectively use it.andP;  We first have to understand that allinformation is not alike, that we can get to some easily and some with moredifficulty.andP;  According to Digital's Dennis Saloky, there are three areas ofinformation that we want to be able to get to:andM;* That which we know exists, and we know where it isandM;* That which we know exists, but we don't know where it isandM;* That which we don't know existsandM;The challenge is to build systems that enable us to access all three.andM;Then we have to face the issues of the use of the information itself:information access as power (as discussed above), the permanence andhalf-life of information (do we keep everything? how long is it valuable? atwhat cost?), and how the quantity, quality, and flow of information affectsthe way we work.andP;  On this last point, Digital's Howard Webber notes,&quot;Sensitive management of information has a lot to do with our ability to workin task-oriented groups.&quot;andM;ConclusionandM;While filtering applications in their current state leave us with morequestions than answers, there are certain guidelines that we can use toincrease the probability of effectively implementing them.andM;The first is, to use Tom Malone's term, &quot;incremental adoption.&quot;andP;  We cannotchange our information functions in a single sweep, nor can we suddenlychange the ways people work.andP;  The new technologies must, for a while, workalongside the older procedures--both technical (such as current electronicmail systems) and organizational.andP;  We must be willing to let some individualsget some of the benefits before the whole organization is ready to buy in.andM;The second tactic is to try to gain users' trust in the agents by deliveringlots of sample agents and filters that work and let users compare them withtheir current procedures to see what information is buried or lost.andM;Finally, we must be clear that, for these information-enhancing technologiesto succeed, we must know our businesses and jobs, and how the availability ofinformation affects them.andP;  Sitting and watching an ongoing news feed may befun for some, but unless their business is defined by needing to watch thatfeed, they are simply wasting time.andP;  Initial implementations of filters willhelp us understand the relationship of information to our business, or atleast point out what we don't know about it.andP;  In the long run, these systemsmust be implemented strategically, not as toys.andM;Filters and agents will be important tools in our quest for turning themassive amounts of data we face each day into usable information.andP;  Thechallenge will then shift to where it should have been in the firstplace--how to turn information into knowledge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
