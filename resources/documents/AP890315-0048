The Environmental Protection Agency also has stated itsopposition to the NRC plan.   The commission is evaluating the hundreds of written responses ithas received to a proposal published last December to end regulationof wastes _ from nuclear plants, medical research, recycled metalsand consumer products _ which emit radiation at levels so low as tobe deemed acceptable risks to public health.   The commission proposed setting the limit at 10 millirems peryear per person. By comparison, radiation from a single X-ray isabout 30 millirems, and the average American is exposed to between200 millirems and 300 millirems a year from natural backgroundradiation, not counting X-rays.   In its proposal, the NRC said ``there is no clear consensus,''based on existing scientific data, on exactly what level ofradiation exposure should be considered an acceptable risk. Congressin 1985 instructed the NRC to set such a limit.   The commission said the risk of cancer death associated withexposure to 10 millirems per year is two in 1 million. A level ofrisk even five times greater than this would be of ``little concernto most members of society,'' it said.   Of those writing to express a view on the proposal, nuclearutilities and scientists were uniformly in favor, although somedisagreed on the exact level of acceptable exposure.   John J. Kearney, writing on behalf of the health physicscommittee of the Edison Electric Institute, proposed a dose limit ofas high as 20 millirems per year.   ``The associated risks, if any, are quite small compared to otheractual risks an individual faces every day,'' he wrote. His group isan electric utility trade group.   Many private individuals, however, said they were troubled at theprospect of allowing producers of toxic wastes to dispose of itwithout federal controls.   ``It is beyond belief that instead of being more vigilant withprotecting us from radioactive poison you are pursuing a policy toallow more radioactive materials to enter our soil and water,''Dolores M. Moran of Avon Lake, Ohio, wrote.   ``We certainly cannot look to the waste generators to regulatethemselves,'' wrote Linda Dangelo of Lincoln, Neb.   The EPA, in a letter signed by Richard E. Sanderson, director ofthe Office of Federal Activities, said it was troubled by severalaspects of the proposal, including doubts about safety andcompatibility with EPA's waste-control authority.   ``We do not believe the policy would adequately protect publichealth and the quality of man's environment,'' the EPA letter said.   Many environmental groups have strongly criticized the proposal.The Public Citizen group founded by Ralph Nader has accused the NRCof bowing to nuclear industry pressure to help reduce the cost ofdisposing of radioactive wastes. It contends the measure, ifadopted, would cut those costs by $1 billion over 20 years.   ``Notwithstanding that there is no safe level of radiationexposure, this policy would allow nuclear waste to be disposed of inyour local garbage dump like banana peels and coffee grounds,'' saidScott Saleska, a Public Citizen nuclear waste specialist.   Although the majority of letters received by the NRC from privateindividuals expressed opposition to the proposal, some others saidsafety concerns were overblown.   ``I feel society has an unhealthy obsession about zero risk,''wrote Michael A. Ruhe of Charlotte, N.C.</TEXT></DOC>
