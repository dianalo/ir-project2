The proposed legislation is similar in many respects toChapter 11 proceedings of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. ButCanadian officials said the Canadian legislation includessafeguards against what they viewed as Chapter 11 abuses.</LP><TEXT>   The Canadian bill gives financially troubled businesses 30days to negotiate with creditors and attempt commercialreorganization. After the 30 days, a company can eithersubmit a commercial reorganization plan to its creditors orit can ask a court to extend for as much as five months itsprotection from creditors.   Under existing Canadian law, secured creditors can demandpayment at any time or petition to have a receiver appointedto protect their assets, making reorganization difficult andoccasionally forcing potentially viable debtor companies intopremature receivership or bankruptcy.   The proposed legislation would allow creditors to name atrustee to watch over the operations of a company that hasbeen granted the court protection. They also could ask thecourt to lift the protection. These provisions were designedto keep companies from squandering their assets while undercourt protection from creditors. In the U.S., the officialssaid heavy losses frequently persist during Chapter 11proceedings, leaving creditors with little or nothing.   &quot;Chapter 11 is open to abuse by people who want to buytime when they don't have a reasonable prospect forrecovery,&quot; said Bill Beavers, senior vice president of theaccounting firm of Ernst andamp; Young.   Pierre Blais, minister of consumer and corporate affairs,said, &quot;We are convinced that in giving viable enterprises thechance to reorganize, we can avoid many bankruptcies.&quot;   Canadian business bankruptcies in the first four months ofthis year totaled 4,784, a 36.5% increase from a yearearlier.   Uwe Manski, second vice president of the CanadianInsolvency Association, said the proposed legislation willprobably make Canadian banks less inclined to lend againstsecurity, because they will no longer be as free to repossessthe security and liquidate.   The new legislation provides increased protection forunpaid suppliers and for wage earners. Unpaid suppliers areto be given the right to reclaim goods from a firm that issubsequently declared bankrupt, within 30 days of delivery.To provide workers with a greater degree of protection inbankruptcies, the government intends to establish a programthat will be funded by employers. It is expected to costemployers about 10 cents per employee per week. The programwill allow employees of a bankrupt company to receive up to2,000 Canadian dollars (US$1,750) for wages and vacation payowed.</TEXT></DOC>
