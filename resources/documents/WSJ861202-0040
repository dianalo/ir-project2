After extended months of refitting in San Antonio to carry nuclear-tipped cruise missiles instead of bombs, the aircraft made a relatively short hop to Fort Worth, Texas, and joined active service with the Strategic Air Command at Carswell Air Force Base. The plane officially became the 131st airborne cruise-missile carrier and thus breached the SALT II limit on total nuclear delivery systems. But the breakthrough may be short-lived, since Congress can be expected to try to roll back the president's decision.    President Reagan announced last May that the U.S. would no longer be bound by the unratified and expired SALT II agreement President Carter signed in 1979 with the Soviet Union. Mr. Reagan said specifically that the U.S. would exceed the SALT II limits on nuclear delivery systems later in the year as soon as cruise-missile modifications were completed on the 131st converted B-52. Until then, he said, the U.S. would remain in voluntary compliance with the treaty.    Delivery of the latest plane to SAC was then delayed. The purported reason was technical problems in the refitting effort. The real reasons were political. White House officials said in late August the plane would not come out of its hangar before a &quot;possible&quot; summit meeting between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. At the same time, traditional arms controllers in the House were advocating measures to ban spending on any new weapons that would exceed the SALT II limits.    The House conferees on the defense-appropriations bill eventually backed off from the SALT II amendments after Senate Republicans refused to budge. The House Democrats did, however, win cuts in the Strategic Defense Initiative budget and banned spending on new chemical weapons.    Friday's B-52 flight has now set off a new round of criticism of the Reagan administration's renunciation of SALT II.    Mr. Gorbachev said it is &quot;a major mistake, which will make it more difficult to search for the approaches for disarmament.&quot; House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin called the action a &quot;very bad decision&quot; intended to &quot;shore up Ronald Reagan with the right wing.&quot; Rep. Jim Wright viewed the development as &quot;a renewal of the arms race.&quot; And Sen. Sam Nunn said it &quot;gives the Soviet Union a military advantage, with its near-term missile-production capabilities, as well as a substantial world propaganda advantage.&quot; He added that the decision will make it &quot;much harder to reach a bipartisan consensus on strategic weapons and arms control here at home.&quot;    Well, Sen. Nunn is undoubtedly right about increased partisan friction on arms control. Democrats are likely to again bring resolutions to the floor prohibiting spending on weapons systems that breach SALT II. If so, we are in for not only friction but a lot of wheel-spinning on this subject.    SALT II has become mainly an arms-control shibboleth, invoked constantly by one holier-than-thou faction in the strategic debate that got the treaty it wanted but couldn't get it ratified by the U.S. Senate. Lately these people have been trying to &quot;ratify&quot; the treaty piecemeal amidst the general confusion of congressional legislating. Somehow their efforts keep the phrase &quot;SALT II&quot; in print, but their constant harping can hardly be said to constitute a coherent or sophisticated response to the president's actions.    We understand well enough why these Democrats believe that forcing the U.S. to comply with SALT II puts them on the side of the angels. But before they take all the citizens of this country with them into the land of the angels, we hope they will be asked to show in detail why tying the hands of the U.S. will alter anything Mr. Gorbachev intends to do to protect and enhance the Soviet Union's own strategic capabilities. </TEXT></DOC>
