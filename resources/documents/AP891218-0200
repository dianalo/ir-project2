The producers of ``Visions of Ecstasy,'' a 20-minute video aboutthe saint, lost an appeal to the Video Appeals Committee, which hasmet just six times since it was created five years ago.   John Stephenson, producer of the video, said his company wasconsidering a further appeal, to Britain's High Court.   ``We condemn the decision as a disgraceful act of censorship,''Stephenson said. ``Free expression in relation to religion is afundamental right in a pluralistic society.''   The video was defended by novelists Fay Weldn and Marina Warneras a legitimate exploration of the connection between sexualpassion and religious fervor as expressed in such Christian notionsas ``the bride of Christ.''   The video was ``not in any way an insult to God, who, I mightsuggest, is not easily insulted,'' Ms. Weldon told the appealscommittee.   The video shows Teresa caressing the body of Christ on the crossand in amorous embraces with another woman. The producers say thescenes are clearly Teresa's imagination, and the two womenrepresent two sides of her personality.   It is the first time in 77 years that the board of censors hadrejected a film because of the blasphemy law. It was givenresponsibility for reviewing videos in 1984.   Recently, the board cleared Martin Scorsese's controversialmovie, ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' though it was condemnedby many Christians because it included a brief scene of Christimagining that he was making love with Mary Magdalene.   ``It indicated that Christ had sex,'' James Ferman, director ofthe film classification board, told the appeals panel at thehearing on ``Visions of Ecstacy.''   Ferman said he thought the video showed contempt for thedivinity of Christ by presenting him as a living man, not a symbol,and as an object of sexual passion. He said he was particularlyoffended by intercutting the figure of Christ into the scenebetween the two women.   ``There is no attempt to flesh the character physically,metaphysically or spiritually of St. Teresa, who undertakesmovements on the body of the crucified Christ. That is the kernelof the objection,'' Richard Du Cann, attorney for the board, toldthe appeals hearing.   Geoffrey Robertson, attorney for Axel Ltd., which produced thevideo, said the board was only speculating that a court would findthe production blasphemous. He called the video an ``imaginative,metaphoric'' portrayal of religious ecstasy.   ``One wonders what is going on, why the board decided to takethis attitude,'' said Andrew Puddephat, director of the NationalCouncil for Civil Liberties.   Though rarely applied, the blasphemy law has been discussedfrequently in the past year in the controversy over SalmanRushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verse,'' which many Moslems chargeblasphemes Islam in its portrayal of the Prophet Mohammed.   However, Britain's blasphemy law applies only to Christianreligions, and the government has rejected appeals to broaden it.   Puddephat said he saw no parallel between the controversies over``Visions of Ecstasy'' and ``The Satanic Verses,'' but he added:``Sooner or later someone will make it.''   Stephenson, the producer, told The Independent newspaper that hethought the film would sell about 200 copies and disappear, and hehad not anticipated any trouble with the censors.   ``Personally, I object to pornography _ probably more so thanthe board,'' said Stephenson, who described himself as a formerdevout Roman Catholic.   ``Our intention was not to offend, to titillate or beprovocative. It was to explore something in our own way. ... Thewhole iconography, language and meaning of the Catholic religionare so bound up with images of blood, pain, suffering andsacrifice. Those in turn are linked to beauty and eroticism.''   Marina Warner, who has written scholarly studies of Joan of Arcand the cult of the Virgin Mary, said that if the video wasblasphemous, it was blasphemous in the same sense as the writingsof Teresa and of St. Catherine of Siena, who both employederotically charged images.   In 1970, they were the first two women to be cited as ``doctorsof the church'' by the Vatican.   Teresa, born in Avila in 1515, fell into trances and experiencedvivid visions of Christ, Satan and angels.   Teresa and her visions have long been a subject for art, notablyGian Lorenzo Bernini's statue ``The Ecstasy of St. Teresa'' in thechapel of Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome.   Film has a special problem, Ms. Warner said, because actors areeasily taken to represent real people, and ``the idea of allegorystarts evaporating.''   Though such imagery might be congenial to 16th-century SpanishCatholics, Ms. Warner said, it would be anathema to Protestants.   ``One religion is a blasphemy against another; one sect is ablasphemy of another,'' she said in an interview.   ``I thoroughly disapprove of the law of blasphemy, and I thinkit should be repealed. I think its divisive, unjust andcapricious.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wednesday PMs, Dec. 27</NOTE></DOC>
