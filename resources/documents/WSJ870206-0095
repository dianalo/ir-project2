The patent held by the Dutch company, Akzo N.V., is for a solvent used to make polymers for the aramid-fiber manufacturing process. The original ruling was in a Richmond, Va., federal court.    The two chemicals companies have been battling over aramid fibers in the U.S. and elsewhere since the early 1980s. Du Pont currently dominates the world market for aramid fibers. Kevlar is used in airplanes and bulletproof vests, among other things. </TEXT></DOC>
