Barrett (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> INS PHA FIN </IN><TEXT>   Personal-injury lawyers don't take defeat lying down. Unable to keep state legislatures from curbing plaintiffs' rights, these attorneys are fighting back in the forum they know best: the courts.    And they are scoring some victories. Since April, the supreme courts of Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Wyoming and Alaska have struck down parts of state laws that limited jury awards or otherwise restricted plaintiffs in injury lawsuits. The Texas court, for example, abolished that state's $500,000 limit on awards in medical-malpractice cases. The Wyoming court overturned a state law requiring nonjudicial review panels to screen claims against health-care providers before trials.    At stake in the confrontations is the future shape of tort law, which controls the compensation people who claim injuries can get using the civil justice system.    Alarmed by soaring commercial and municipal insurance rates, and the disappearance of some types of coverage, legislatures in almost every state have restricted plaintiffs' rights in recent years. This action expanded on laws many states passed in the mid-1970s that, in effect, limited patients' ability to win large awards for medical-malpractice claims. In addition to caps on jury awards, other restrictions include elimination of punitive damages, cutbacks of lawyers' contingency fees and shorter periods for bringing suits.    Now, plaintiffs' attorneys are asking state judges to invalidate so-called tort reform laws as infringements of such constitutional guarantees as equal protection of law and access to jury trials. Encouraged by their successes, the lawyers predict that judges in other states will be emboldened to reverse lawmakers' decisions.    &quot;A cluster of cases like this creates momentum in other states,&quot; says Jerry R. Palmer, a Topeka, Kan., lawyer and co-chairman of a committee coordinating the challenges on behalf of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. Attacks on laws limiting liability awards are pending in Virginia and Washington state; the next targets are Arizona and Georgia.    Advocates of tort reform emphasize that influential courts in states such as California and New York have upheld disputed legislation. They also note that most successful plaintiff attacks are focused on earlier medical-malpractice limits, which are more vulnerable to being portrayed as unfair because they hinder only plaintiffs suing doctors and hospitals.    In some states, both sides claim victory. Florida's Supreme Court last year eliminated a $450,000 ceiling on awards for &quot;non-economic&quot; damages, which compensate victims for such intangible injuries as pain and suffering. Plaintiffs' lawyers viewed the decision as a triumph. But in the same ruling the court upheld a variety of other restrictions. Meanwhile, some state legislatures pass new laws as quickly as judges knock down existing ones.    Of course, plaintiffs' lawyers have a considerable self-interest in defeating laws that limit recoveries or fees. But tort reform foes insist their central goal is to vindicate people like Austin Sofie, a Seattle pipe fitter who died of lung disease caused by exposure to asbestos.    The attack on Washington's cap on injury recoveries now pending in the state's Supreme Court grew out of a suit on behalf of Mr. Sofie and his wife, Marcia, in which a jury awarded $1,154,592 for &quot;non-economic damages&quot; -- primarily &quot;pain and suffering.&quot; The award, which would be paid by the insurers of 10 former makers of asbestos products, was cut to $125,136 because of the cap, which is based on a complicated formula.    Leonard W. Schroeter, the Sofies' lawyer, says victims of catastrophic injuries shouldn't be the ones forced to sacrifice because of concern about high insurance rates. &quot;Nobody is more innocent than the asbestos worker who was unknowingly exposed to the dangerous product that kills him,&quot; contends Mr. Schroeter.    Traditionally, attorneys trying to overturn state laws have used the U.S. Constitution for ammunition and the federal courts as their battleground. But federal courts, including the Supreme Court, have consistently ruled that state tort reform laws don't violate the U.S. Constitution.    Undaunted, plaintiffs' lawyers have turned to state judges and found a more receptive audience. In a variety of areas, state supreme courts have increasingly interpreted state constitutions to provide broader protections of individual rights than the U.S. Constitution appears to do.    In Washington, Mr. Schroeter has argued that state constitutional guarantees of a trial by jury ought to be interpreted to require that juries set damages without legislative interference. He has also contended that imposing a ceiling on damages, which singles out the most severely injured plaintiffs, violates a provision ensuring equal protection of law.    Another aspect of the trial lawyers' strategy is to ask state courts to scrutinize the main justification of tort reform: that expansive theories of liability and excessive jury awards caused an &quot;insurance crisis.&quot; The plaintiffs' advocates charge that insurers themselves created the crisis through unwise underwriting practices and collusive removal of unprofitable policies.    Judges, both federal and state, usually defer to legislators on the reasonableness of economic regulation as long as there could be some rational basis for the law in question. But some state courts, rather than dismissing the plaintiffs' contention, have expressed doubt about whether lawmakers knew what they were doing when they passed tort reform.    In May, the Texas Supreme Court said it invalidated that state's cap on awards in medical-malpractice cases in part because of independent research that indicated &quot;no relationship between a damage cap and increases in insurance rates.&quot; Similarly, in June, the Wyoming Supreme Court explained its rejection of pretrial screening of claims against health-care providers by noting the &quot;absence in the record of any evidence that the (insurance) 'crisis,' if in fact it exists, is in any way connected with medical-malpractice claims.&quot;    Plaintiffs' lawyers are particularly excited by a recent investigation by state attorneys general. In lawsuits filed earlier this year, 19 chief state prosecutors charged 31 insurance industry defendants with manipulating prices and limiting the availability of liability policies widely used by businesses and municipalities.    &quot;The evidence the AGs have gathered is the kind of thing we want to get before the courts,&quot; says Jeffrey R. White, associate general counsel of the trial lawyers group.    In response to the attorneys general's suit, the Insurance Information Institute, a New York industry trade group, has denied any wrongdoing and blamed high rates in large part on spiraling jury awards.    The next step in the plaintiffs' attack, says Mr. Palmer of Topeka, will be initiating controversial test cases designed to set precedent, rather than waiting for constitutional issues to percolate up naturally through uncoordinated lawsuits.    As a model, Mr. Palmer points to the Kansas Supreme Court's decision in June that invalidated certain medical-malpractice award limits and a law requiring that compensation for plaintiffs' future losses be paid as annuities rather than in lump sums. The suit that prompted the ruling was brought on behalf of a state coalition of alleged malpractice victims, not an individual appealing a particular trial result. The appeals court, in effect, agreed to strike down the laws preemptively in what is known as a declaratory judgment.    Considerable obstacles could inhibit such aggressive tactics in other states. Many courts enforce stringent demands that groups seeking declaratory judgments have a direct and immediate interest in the controversy at hand. And Mr. Schroeter concedes that for him and other tort specialists, presenting constitutional arguments is unfamiliar terrain.    But, he says, &quot;we will learn from our mistakes and continue the fight.&quot;    ---                    Winning and Losing   How some tort-reform laws have fared in state courts                   Defendants' victories              (Laws upheld by state courts)   California -- Cap of $250,000 on awards for non-economic damages in medical-malpractice cases.
