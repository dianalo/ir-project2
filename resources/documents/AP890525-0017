Nearby, a sea of ramshackle tents and campsites stretches acrossTiananmen Square.   A makeshift tent city has sprung up on the 100-acre square,where about 30,000 students leading a civil uprising for democraticreforms and an end to official corruption have camped out for thepast 13 days.   ``It's great, I like sleeping on top of this bus,'' said Yang, ajunior from Inner Mongolia studying management at BeijingUniversity of Science and Technology. ``It's quite comfortable uphere.''   More than 100 buses are lined up at the north end of the square,under the gaze of a portrait of Mao Tse-tung, Communist China'sfounder. Students clamber to their lofty beds through windows andair vents, and hop from roof to roof to get around, while othersbunk out underneath the big rigs.   Hundreds of scarlet flags flutter above the squatters and frombuses, which are plastered with slogans such as ``1.1 billionhearts are bleeding.''   This city within a square has roads, food depots, clinics andits own radio station, actually a network of loudspeakers. Itsleaders are sequestered at the two-tiered Monument to the People'sHeroes, surrounded by three cordons of student security guards.   Those who built it are their own government and their own police.   Only students, journalists, medical personnel and thosedelivering food are allowed in and the student guards demandidentification at every checkpoint.   During the day the students take turns guarding Tiananmen'sperimeter or defending the square from soldiers who might be sentto disperse them.   Premier Li Peng on Saturday declared martial law in Beijing andordered in soldiers to restore order. In response, city residentsblocked major roads with barricades and the soldiers have yet tocome.   ``It's really tough. The government cut off the water at thesquare and won't let some hospitals deliver medicine,'' said asophomore from Shenzhen University, 1,300 miles south of Beijing.   Duan Bin, a junior from far western Xinjiang province whostudies at Beijing Forestry College gestured around a bus providedby sympathetic transport workers. ``The people of Beijing donatedeverything to us, blankets, mattresses, food, clothing,cigarettes.''   Two buses _ set apart from the others _ are used as toilets.They reek and leak onto the square.   First aid stations are on the road in front of the Museum ofHistory on Tiananmen's east side. A week ago the street wasscreaming with ambulances taking away hunger strikers every two tothree minutes, leading students to nickname the alley `TheLifeline.'''   These days the clinics treat students mainly for colds, sorethroats, diarrhea and sunstroke, said a volunteer doctor fromBeijing Union Medical College.   ``I've only slept two or three hours a day for the last week,''the doctor said. ``I work overnight at the hospital and donate mydays to the students.''   The borders around Tiananmen abound with merchants, marchers andmoochers. Popsicle and soda pop vendors do a booming business anddo not charge students. Others hawk watermelons, hardboiled eggsand Chinese crepes while couples picnic in the reviewing standsnext to the balcony from where Mao declared the foundation of thePeople's Republic of China in 1949.   A rainstorm on Tuesday scattered hundreds of thousands ofsupporters. About 5,000 spent the night jammed into two undergroundpassageways out of the square, turning them into anthills ofhumanity.   The biggest question is how long the squatters will remain. Thestudent-run radio has told them to stay until the unpopular Li isgone. But some maintain the students have sown enough confusion inthe party and military that they can leave in glory.   After a tense weekend when the students and citizenry of Beijingwere convinced they would be attacked by the People's LiberationArmy, fears have abated that military might raze the tent city.   Despite the martial law decree, the only soldiers in sight aretwo honor guards at Tiananmen's flagpole, their holsters empty.   ``The army's not here, so how can this be martial law?'' askedYang, the accordionist. ``We're not afraid. The people of Beijingwill keep them out.''</TEXT></DOC>
