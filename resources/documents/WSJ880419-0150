He was one of the noble spirits of our age and wrote one of its noblest books. With the appearance of &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; in 1948, the world outside South Africa discovered what manner of man he was. Though he wrote other fine books his literary distinction was only part of his character and contribution, which ranged from teacher to penal reformer to opponent of apartheid.    The land of South Africa remained ever beloved to him although his relations with its government were turbulent. His opposition to racial policies led to arbitrary police searches and seizures at his home. His eloquent testimony internationally caused the government to withdraw his passport in 1960. In 1970 the authorities restored it, having found that they could neither force him into exile nor confine his passionate voice within state boundaries.    &quot;Towards the Mountain&quot; (1980), the first volume of his autobiography, tells how, by chance, acute political crisis in South Africa began in the same year as the publication of &quot;Cry,&quot; altering the direction of his life. In May 1948, the harsh National Party dominated by D.F. Malan allied with the Afrikaner Party and swept from office Prime Minister Jan Christian Smuts and his deputy, J.H. Hofmeyr, friend and mentor of Mr. Paton. Then began the rigid policy of separating &quot;the different races of South Africa in every conceivable sphere of life.&quot;    In 1958 Mr. Paton founded the Liberal Party. In its short life it attained only four seats in parliament. In 1968 the government formally outlawed it because of its multiracial membership. Much of that history is distilled in his third, almost documentary, novel, &quot;Ah, but Your Land Is Beautiful&quot; (1982). Details of those years, with the complex political/economic twists and developments in South Africa, presumably are unfolded in the completion of his autobiography.    As age and illness encroached upon his extraordinary energies, many felt concern over whether he could finish the work. He did. It is fitting that the second volume of &quot;Towards the Mountain&quot; -- &quot;The Journey Continued&quot; -- is published in South Africa in this month of his death. Scribner's, his American (and first) publisher, hopes to bring it out by July.    Many people will have personal memories of him. These are only a few of mine. I knew Alan for nearly 40 years, involving much time together and many hours of searching conversation. I saw him last in November 1977, when, with his wife, Anne, he stayed overnight in our home, at that time in Kent, Conn. He drove to Harvard the next day for a series of lectures.    It was a secret visit by his stipulation. He had lamented in a letter, back in 1972: &quot;Visiting the States is an agony if you take it seriously -- we did not go near many friends at all. In San F. I actually asked one friend not to let another know we had been there -- that's bad, isn't it?&quot; It was realistic. He came to the U.S. perhaps twice in the 1980s. We meanwhile had moved to North Carolina and realized it was unlikely we could see him again.    Talk that night in 1977 found him privately depressed about South Africa. Drastic changes in the situation were making a &quot;moderate&quot; of the man once branded a radical. By his final years some called him conservative. He was caught between extremes -- the government and the communist African National Congress.    A few days after the visit he reported on a post card about the Harvard lectures, &quot;First night some hostility, second and third nights none.&quot; A little later, Anne Paton added in a letter, &quot;He got heckled by the ANC at Harvard, but he coped manfully with them, and they were made to appear rather foolish.&quot;    He opposed violence from any sector, convinced it would lead only to more sweeping tragedy. He disapproved of economic sanctions by the U.S. and other countries, regarding such efforts to isolate South Africa as ineffective against apartheid, ultimately harmful, and further divisive among the by-no-means unanimous victims of the system. The second part of the autobiography will contain his final definition of his views.    At first impression Mr. Paton's appearance was deceptive. His lean, austere face could be mistaken as reflecting some dour Scotch Covenanter ancestors -- piercingly intent in gaze, with thin lips that falsely suggested stern puritanism. He could indeed be stern but acquaintance quickly disclosed depths of humanity, warmth, humor, kindness. As he aged his face became patterned with wrinkles like the crackled glaze on some fine porcelains.    He was a devout Anglican, all his thought permeated by his religion. Yet he knew the sins that churches, and people of faith, can commit. In the autobiography he wrote: &quot;Today I trust only one kind of person who claims to be trying to do God's will, and that is the one who does it humbly.&quot; He believed &quot;life must be used in a cause greater than oneself.&quot;    &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; burst upon the literary scene to unprecedented acclaim in its unheralded small first printing. It was by a man nobody had heard of, from a place few cared about. Its compassion, conviction and lyricism have caused it to be read by millions around the world in 20 languages. Pitting love against hate, it shows those who do harm entangled with those who suffer it, tragically interlocked as they have been and may remain through human history. Mr. Paton gave it the often overlooked subtitle &quot;A Story of Comfort in Desolation.&quot;    &quot;Towards the Mountain&quot; takes its title from his Bible-inspired words about &quot;the road to the holy mountain where they neither hurt nor destroy, towards which one travels, not always hopefully, and at which one never arrives.&quot; Not in this life. As we await &quot;The Journey Continued,&quot; the earthly part of that journey is ended for Alan. He is home on the mountain.    ---   Until his retirement last year, Mr. Fuller was the Journal's book critic. </TEXT></DOC>
