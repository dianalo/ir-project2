Nixon remembers the first time an older executive tried to take him under his wing. It was in the mid-1950s, when Mr. Nixon was a young engineer at General Electric Co.'s flight-propulsion center in Cincinnati. The manager, who had taken an interest in Mr. Nixon's career, suggested a friendly game of squash at the local YMCA.    They never played the game. Because Mr. Nixon is black, he wasn't allowed on the court, he says. &quot;That was the end of that mentoring relationship,&quot; recalls Mr. Nixon, now the 54-year-old managing director of North American Venture Development Group in New York.    Today, &quot;the problems are not as overt,&quot; says Mr. Nixon's 32-year-old son, James Nixon III, an architect with Nadler-Philopena Associates in Mt. Kisco, N.Y. Yet in corporate suites still dominated by white males, mentoring remains a rite of passage into the old-boy network. Minority and women employees often continue to be shut out of this network for at least part of their working lives, unable to find older executives willing to coach them, protect them and push their careers.    Suzanne Burton Armour, the only black female among a dozen pharmaceutical production managers at Upjohn Co. in Kalamazoo, Mich., says two white males counseled her for a time earlier in her career, but after one died and the other was promoted out of reach, she was on her own. &quot;I missed a lot,&quot; she says. &quot;What a white male talks to me about is different from a black female or a black male.&quot;    On lacking a mentor, she says, &quot;I feel intuitively it has limited my career.&quot; Jobs she wanted went to &quot;friends of friends&quot; of those in power, she says. &quot;My ambitions and goals -- nobody knew about them.&quot;    Of course, finding a high-placed cheerleader, confidant and role model is by no means essential for success. Janelle Bedke says she never had a mentor in 10 years at Hewlett-Packard Co., where she rose to project manager. Nor does she have one now, at 38, as president of Software Publishing Corp. in Mountain View, Calif. &quot;I don't feel my career has been affected,&quot; she says. &quot;Each person is responsible for her own career.&quot;    Mentoring relationships, moreover, don't always work. Given the ordinary flux of corporate careers, even successful pairings typically last only two to five years, and sometimes end in a disruptive jolt for both parties. Further, the guidance and support provided by a senior mentor can also come from a peer at work, a friend outside, or even a subordinate.    But many executives who have made it to the top credit their mentors with smoothing the way. When Korn/Ferry International, an executive-recruiting firm, asked 1,300 senior executives (mostly white males) what experiences and contacts had a significant impact on their careers, 15% cited mentors. (Only education ranked higher.) But this help often isn't readily available to women and minorities.    Such mentoring relationships are especially hard to forge at upper-management levels, where many executives have had little experience working closely with women or minorities, says Kathy E. Kram, a professor at Boston University's School of Management who has written widely on the process. &quot;It's easier for people to mentor people like themselves,&quot; she says.    Part of the difficulty is that mentoring is based on &quot;friendship, admiration and nurturing&quot; developed outside a 9-to-5 schedule, says Richard Clarke of Richard Clarke Associates, a New York executive-search firm specializing in minority recruiting. Whites, he says, usually &quot;don't see blacks at the beach, sailing or on weekends&quot; because they lead separate lives away from the job.    The senior Mr. Nixon echoes this view. What blacks miss, he declares, is &quot;the opportunity for mentoring to happen comfortably.&quot; Because many whites and blacks don't mingle often socially, he says whites &quot;don't get to know me as a person, they can't get to trust me with part of their job.&quot; Mr. Nixon managed to build up enough trust, though, to move up the ranks at GE and later at ITT Corp., where he ultimately became vice president and director of equal-opportunity operations.    For women, too, lack of informal contact with potential mentors can be a hindrance. Donna Taylor, 43, a Hispanic who says she is responsible for fostering diversity in the work force at Digital Equipment Corp. in Maynard, Mass., says that at a previous company, only males seemed to get any mentoring. One vice president, she recalls, habitually invited his junior male managers into his office for bull sessions, but women managers were excluded. Promotions, she says, invariably went to the men. Her situation has been very different in the merit-oriented computer industry; senior managers at Digital have stepped forward to foster her career.    Women also face different barriers than minority men. Catalyst, a New York group that fosters women's careers, says some men hesitate to take on female proteges -- and female subordinates share their wariness -- because of the sexual innuendoes that often accompany such relationships.    Laura Hoffman, 43, a white who is president of Hoffman-Daggett Associates, a Westport, Conn., marketing agency for high-technology and information companies, attributes part of her success to mentoring in previous corporate and government jobs. But with two of her male mentors, she says, &quot;there were rumors that we were sleeping together.&quot; Such gossip &quot;is very upsetting,&quot; but &quot;it does you no good to deny it.&quot; When the rumors became uncomfortable, she recalls, &quot;the relationships became strained&quot; as she and her mentors tried to avoid arousing further suspicion.    For some women, mentoring help comes late, in part because they sometimes must prove themselves longer than their male colleagues. Lydia Williams, 38, a black who is a regional accounts-payable manager for U S West Inc.'s Mountain Bell Telephone Co. subsidiary in Denver, says she is only starting to get any mentoring, after 13 years with the company.    &quot;People are working to give me the exposure to move up in the corporation,&quot; she says. Recently, for example, she was given a high-profile assignment that will give her a chance to demonstrate her abilities to senior management. Yet she still concludes that &quot;there seems to be some kind of natural alliance of white males&quot; that sometimes ignores the needs of others.    Some younger female managers, furthermore, shun help from women executives who have preceded them. &quot;The career women who were the first to reach top positions are often considered lonely, isolated and entirely devoted to their work,&quot; says a Catalyst report. Many younger women, it adds, reject these pioneers as role models, seeking instead &quot;both a full personal life and a career.&quot;    Some firms try to overcome barriers of race and sex by assigning mentors to promising young executives. At BankAmerica Corp., a senior manager may be asked to counsel three or four juniors for a year at a time, says Robert N. Beck, executive vice president of human resources.    Many mentoring specialists caution that such company intervention often proves fruitless. But Gail Lantrip, a 35-year-old Bank of America branch manager in Sacramento, Calif., says just being picked for the program has boosted her self-esteem, a central goal of any mentoring effort. </TEXT></DOC>
