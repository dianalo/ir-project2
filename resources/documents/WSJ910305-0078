Keller   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/05/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><CO>   T UT GTE MCIC</CO><IN>COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (CMT)TELEPHONE SYSTEMS (TLS)</IN><GV>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF)</GV><LP>   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. complained that theGeneral Services Administration gave US Sprint CommunicationsCo. a lucrative telecommunications services order from theNavy and Marine Corps -- business ATandamp;T said it had beenpromised under the giant FTS-2000 federal phone contract.   In its protest filed with the GSA's Board of ContractAppeals, ATandamp;T accused the GSA of conducting &quot;secretnegotiations&quot; last fall to move Navy and Marine Corps voiceand data traffic to Sprint's network, from ATandamp;T's, inexchange for lower pricing.</LP><TEXT>   GSA's move resulted in a &quot;significant loss of business. ..that should have been ATandamp;T's,&quot; said an ATandamp;T spokesman, whodeclined to give the value of the loss. &quot;We were preparingservices for the Navy. We had several meetings with the GSAto figure out why we lost the business, but only last monthwe were told by the GSA that it had had talks with Sprintthat led to some price concessions.&quot;   In its complaint, ATandamp;T said that it &quot;repeatedly requestedGSA to explain the basis for its actions&quot; and that it wasn'tgiven a chance to beat Sprint's new pricing, which the GSArefuses to divulge.   ATandamp;T's complaint joins numerous problems that have plaguedthe megaproject to modernize Uncle Sam's phone service sincethe estimated $25 billion, 10-year contract was awarded inDecember 1988. Under the contract, the GSA agreed to giveATandamp;T business generating 60% of the revenue, and to give theother 40% to Sprint, a unit of United Telecommunications Inc.However, ATandamp;T claims that so far, it has received only 43% ofthe revenue vs. Sprint's 57%.   The GSA declined to comment on matters before the board. ASprint spokeswoman referred inquiries on ATandamp;T's complaint tothe GSA. She said that Sprint &quot;has been aggressive aboutmarketing new technologies to federal agencies, and it's ourunderstanding that the 60-40 split is a contract goal (of theGSA's) rather than a guarantee.&quot;   ATandamp;T is asking the appeals board, an independent tribunalwithin the GSA that operates like a federal court, toreinstate its Navy and Marine business and award undisclosedprotest costs and attorneys' fees.   Even if the board finds for ATandamp;T, FTS will continue togenerate controversy. Another ATandamp;T nemesis, MCICommunications Corp., has begun nipping at the edges of theFTS contract, looking for a wedge into what has been calledthe most lucrative and sophisticated voice and data servicescontract ever awarded.   MCI has offered to charge any federal agency that jumps toits network up to 40% less than its rivals for long-distancevoice and data transmission services.</TEXT></DOC>
