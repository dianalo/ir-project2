Firestone's stock has risen four points on triple the normal volume in the two trading days since Tuesday's announcement that Mr. Suter would join Firestone from Emerson Electric. Mr. Suter, 51 years old, is thought to be in line to succeed John J. Nevin, Firestone's chairman.    The speculation -- or maybe wishful thinking -- was that Mr. Suter's advent made it likelier that Firestone might go private in a leveraged buyout or be split up, with some analysts valuing its tire business alone at $40 a share.    The 60-year-old Mr. Nevin, who must retire by age 65, is unpredictable enough by himself. He has voluntarily sold most of Firestone's non-tire businesses, unlike Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber and GenCorp, which had to be forced by raiders to take similar steps. Yet Mr. Nevin hopes to expand Firestone's auto service retail chain and possibly diversify into car rentals via that same chain.    Although the results have been uneven during Mr. Nevin's eight-year reign at the top, Firestone's stock has nearly doubled to 44 7/8 from 24 in the past year. Because much of Mr. Nevin's pay is pegged to the stock price, that helped make his 1986 earnings the fourth highest among U.S. executives in a survey by Business Week magazine.    One market watcher said Mr. Suter's arrival wasn't the only trigger for the price run-up. He also traced it to tire industry analyst Saul Ludwig of Roulston andamp; Co., a Cleveland-based brokerage, near Firestone's hometown of Akron, Ohio.    This auto industry expert says Roulston's sales staff passed the word Tuesday morning that Mr. Ludwig believes there may be some action to break up Firestone within the next 18 months, realizing an estimated value of $60 a share. Mr. Ludwig was said to value the tire business at $40 a share and the retail business at $20 a share.    Among the reported signs that such a step might take place: Mr. Nevin's decision to move Firestone headquarters to Chicago from its manufacturing center in Akron, and certain changes the company has made in reporting its segment results.    Mr. Ludwig wouldn't confirm the market reports of his views.    However, a shareholder who recently sold Firestone stock valued the tire business at five times cash flow, or $38, and valued the retail unit at 10 times earnings, or $5.    Another Cleveland analyst, Harry Millis of McDonald andamp; Co., said he downgraded Firestone stock to an &quot;underweighted&quot; rating Tuesday based on that day's gain of 3 1/8. He said tire companies normally sell at 60% to 70% of the market multiple during peak earnings periods, while Firestone is trading at only a slight discount.    Mr. Millis estimates Firestone will earn $2.70 a share in the fiscal year ending October 1987, and $3.50 a share in fiscal 1988. He puts the &quot;realistic value on the upside&quot; of Firestone stock at $40 to $45 a share.    The McDonald analyst does concede that Firestone's low 20% ratio of debt to total capital makes the company &quot;a very good candidate for a leveraged buyout.&quot; However, others note that tire revenues are subject to the same sort of cyclical fluctuations as those of auto makers, whose stocks sell at steep discounts to the market P/E.    Another tire analyst, Harvey Heinbach of Merrill Lynch, yesterday reiterated his &quot;above-average&quot; rating on the stock, according to market participants. Mr. Heinbach, who couldn't be reached for comment, in late May raised his 1987 earnings estimate on Firestone by 25 cents a share, to $2.75 a share, citing foreign currency gains.    Mr. Heinbach's estimates are for continuing operations and exclude one-time items.    Mr. Heinbach's revised estimate followed Firestone's report of second-quarter earnings from operations. They were a higher-than-expected 75 cents a share, up from 20 cents a share in the same quarter of 1986.    Donald DeScenza, an analyst at Nomura Securities, also questioned whether a breakup or asset sale would yield much more than the stock's current market price. &quot;I don't think anybody's trying to take them over. And I don't see that there's anything to be accomplished by a restructuring,&quot; he said.    A spokesman for Firestone said the company didn't have any comment on its stock activity. He added that Mr. Nevin was on vacation and couldn't be reached to discuss the possibility of a buyout or other restructuring.    ---   Firestone Tire   (NYSE; Symbol: FIR)   Business: Tires and auto service centers.
