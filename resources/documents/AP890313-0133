It quoted Afghanistan's official Bakhtar news agency as sayingAfghan army units were in control and ``reinforcing theirpositions.''   The Tass review of combat at the eastern Afghan city over thepast 24 hours said 215 rebels and Pakistanis were wounded, includingseveral commanders. It did not give casualty figures for thegovernment forces for that period.   It claimed that Pakistani troops operating with the rebels wereburning the bodies of insurgents killed in the battle and said thatenraged other rebels.   Tass also said: ``Eyewitnesses and prisoners of war reportedMonday that officers and military instructors from Pakistan, as wellas the commanders of some opposition groups, have issued secretorders to finish off wounded who cannot be evacuated.   ``The order caused anger among the rebels, who showeddisobedience, and even armed resistance in some cases,'' it said. Itdid not elaborate.   In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a rebel official said the insurgentsexpect to gain control of the country within weeks and then willseek war reparations from the Soviet Union.   Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, foreign minister in a provisional governmentestablished by Afghan Sunni Moslems, spoke at a news conferenceMonday on the opening day of a meeting of foreign ministers of theOrganization of Islamic Conference.   He said, ``The puppet government (of Marxist President Najib inthe Afghan capital of Kabul) will fall within weeks. We areprefectly capable of overrunning Kabul and Jalalabad and otherregions, but we prefer to delay military action in inhabitedregions. We do not want to spill blood any more.''   Hekmatyar claimed the rebels were ``pounding the gates ofJalalabad, have shot down two enemy warplanes and will enter thecity shortly, Allah willing.''   He said a qualified organization would be selected to estimatethe amount of Afghanistan's losses as a result of the Sovietmilitery intervention and how much ``Moscow should pay us inreparations.'' He did not give any figures.   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1978and had as many as 115,000 military peronnel in the country beforeit began a withdrawal early last year. The Kremlin said the pulloutwas completed last month.   Tass, in its account of the battle for Jalalabad, 40 miles westof the Pakistani border and about 70 miles east of Kabul, said therebels bombarded the city's residential areas Sunday with 12,000rockets and shells.   It said five people were killed and 15 wounded in barrages Sundaythat caused widespread destruction.   Soviet television said Sunday the Afghan army reported itrepelled an attack on Jalalabad by 14,000 rebels backed by 3,000Pakistani advisers.   It said the rebels are determined to capture Jalalabad and makeit the base for a transitional government.   Pakistan-based rebels, most of whom are Sunni Moslems, declaredthe formation of a provisional government last month.   Hekmatyar said eight Iran-based rebel groups of Shiite Moslemsare ready to join the provisional government.   ``They have not rejected us, they have not opposed us,'' he said.``It is only a question of power sharing, and they will send adelegation from Iran to negotiate with us in Pakistan on thatscore.''   An estimated 1 billion people in the world are Moslems, and about10 per cent are Shiites. Sunnis form the majority.   Hekmatyar appealed to countries to recognize the provisionalgovernment.   ``An early recognition of our interim government would shortenthe duration of conflict and spare a lot of bloodshed inAfghanistan,'' he said.   Only Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Bahrain had granted recognition tothe rebel government by the time the Riyadh conference began.</TEXT></DOC>
