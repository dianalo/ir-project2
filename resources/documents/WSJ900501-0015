Bush administration officials continued to insist the U.S.won't improve relations with Iran until all the remaininghostages are freed. But while ruling out direct Americanconcessions, there were signs the U.S. wouldn't mind if Iranreaped some benefits.</LP><TEXT>   President Bush said: &quot;We cannot have normalcy as long asany American is held against his will.&quot; But he added thathe'd have &quot;no objection&quot; if Israel releases a Shiite clericit seized last year, as Iran has demanded. And a seniorofficial said the administration would be willing to respondfavorably to new Iranian initiatives in negotiations overfreeing its assets frozen in the U.S. or to an Iranian moveto hold direct talks with the U.S. -- even if such responsesare interpreted by others as reciprocation for the hostagereleases.   The Iranian leadership broke with its past policy andimmediately took direct credit for the freeing yesterday ofhostage Frank Reed by an unknown Lebanese group.   An editorial in the English-language Tehran Times, whichis often used to communicate the regime's views, assertedthat Iran wouldn't seek further hostage releases unless Mr.Bush responded first. It asked the U.S. to &quot;pressure&quot; Israeland its Lebanese allies to free Shiite prisoners.   In a statement, President Bush publicly thanked Iran andSyria. Damascus handled the logistics of the release. Butadministration spokesmen continued to repeat past statementsasserting that no significant gestures would be made towardIran until the remaining six American hostages, and possiblyeven 10 other Westerners, are freed.   A senior State Department official said the U.S. hasn'tany intention of unilaterally releasing frozen Iranianassets. But, he added, if Iran suddenly softened its terms onnegotiations over the assets, the administration wouldn'tblock a resulting asset deal, even though it might be seen asa payoff for the hostage releases.   Similarly, he said, if Iran suddenly proposed direct talksinvolving &quot;authoritative&quot; representatives of its government,the U.S. would honor its previous offer to meet, though notto trade for hostages. Finally, the official said, if Israeland Iran or the Lebanese groups want to arrange a prisonerswap, the U.S. wouldn't block it, although he asserted theadministration isn't pressing Israel to do so.   The official insisted there isn't any evidence that any ofthese possible developments is imminent. &quot;There is nospecific thing we're planning to do,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;Butwe're not going to avoid doing things, if Iran moves theball, just because the Iranians might want to interpret themas gestures by us.&quot;   The Tehran Times editorial complained that the U.S. andthe West didn't reciprocate for the April 22 release ofRobert Polhill. &quot;Now the ball is in the court of the U.S. andthe Western countries,&quot; it said. The newspaper said an&quot;appropriate&quot; response would be for the U.S. to &quot;pressureIsrael&quot; and its Christian allies in Lebanon to release &quot;asignificant number&quot; of Lebanese Shiite prisoners, includingSheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, a radical Shiite cleric Israelseized last summer.   &quot;Naturally, without an appropriate response from theWest,&quot; the editorial said, &quot;there is no chance for thecontinuation of Iranian mediation and requests.&quot;   Tehran may be angered by the State Department's annualreport on terrorism, which was issued yesterday. The studyaccused Iran of being the &quot;most active state sponsor&quot; ofterrorism last year, saying &quot;the events of 1989 indicatedthat Tehran continued to view the selective use of terrorismas a legitimate tool.&quot;   The report specifically charged that President HashemiRafsanjani, who is credited with the recent hostage releases,publicly &quot;encouraged&quot; the killing of Westerners and thehijacking of aircraft last year.   Overall, the terrorism report concluded there had been &quot;asteep decline&quot; in the number of terrorist acts world-widelast year. Incidents fell 38% and deaths of innocent victimsfell to 390 from 638 in 1988, when Pan American Flight 103was blown up.</TEXT></DOC>
