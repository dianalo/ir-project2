Mr. Bush also announced the U.S. is prepared to open talkswith the Soviet Union more quickly than previously planned oncutting existing short-range nuclear missiles. And hedeclared that the U.S. won't put new nuclear artillery shellsinto Western Europe.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;As democracy comes to Eastern Europe and Soviet troopsreturn home, there is less need for nuclear systems of theshortest range,&quot; Mr. Bush said at a news conference. He alsocalled for a meeting of leaders of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization this summer to talk about broader questions ofEuropean security in the wake of the past year's changes inEastern Europe.   The president's steps, which Secretary of State JamesBaker disclosed to America's European allies at a meeting inBrussels at the same time Mr. Bush announced them here,amounts to an attempt to get political mileage out ofdisarmament steps that had become inevitable.   Support had collapsed in both West Germany and in the U.S.Congress for building the new short-range nuclear missiles,which would be a modernized version of the existing Lancemissile. The missiles, which were to be based on German soil,seemed anachronistic because they would be targeted at EastEuropean countries that have shed their Communist governmentsin the last year.   Moreover, with East Germany and West Germany rushingtoward unification, there is little chance leaders of eithercountry would tolerate the deployment of new nuclear-tippedartillery shells anywhere in Germany, as once anticipated.   While the steps Mr. Bush announced are being forced onhim, the administration thinks that packaging them as a newAmerican initiative gives Washington a better chance ofsteering the rapid changes in Europe. By formally droppingplans for new short-range nuclear weapons, and particularlyby accelerating talks on removing existing weapons, Mr. Bushhopes to keep up with public opinion in Western Europe. Healso hopes to prevent a Soviet campaign to quickly drive allnuclear weapons out of Western Europe.   In addition, U.S. officials hope that announcement of thedisarmament moves now will help ease some of the SovietUnion's fears about allowing a new, unified Germany to becomea full-fledged member of NATO, the Western military alliance.The U.S. badly wants the new Germany firmly planted in theWestern camp, but Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev hasrepeatedly objected to that idea.   The U.S. previously had been planning to hold talkseventually with the Soviet Union on cuts in short-rangenuclear missiles. But until yesterday's announcement, theBush administration hadn't been planning to open the talksuntil a treaty slashing U.S. and Soviet conventional forcesin Europe was completed and was being implemented -- probablyaround 1992.   Mr. Bush now is declaring that he's ready to open talkswith the Soviets on short-range nuclear weapons as soon asthe conventional arms treaty is finished -- probably thisfall -- without waiting for it to be implemented.   More broadly, the president's message is that the futureof nuclear weapons in the new Europe should be worked outjointly by the U.S. and its allies, and shouldn't be decidedprecipitously. &quot;The future of the United States cannot beseparated from the future of Europe,&quot; Mr. Bush said. &quot;And so,along with our allies, we must prepare for the magnificentopportunities that lie ahead.&quot;   But actually agreeing with the Soviets on reductions inshort-range nuclear weapons won't be easy. Such weapons wereleft untouched by the accord Mr. Gorbachev and formerPresident Reagan signed in 1987 to eliminateintermediate-range nuclear weapons.   One sticking point in the new negotiations will be theBush administration's hope to maintain an arsenal of nuclearweapons carried on planes even as ground-based nuclearweapons are cut.   In addition, it isn't clear whether the U.S. is willing tonegotiate cuts in existing nuclear-tipped artillery shells aswell as nuclear missiles. And Mr. Bush didn't say whether theultimate American goal is reduction or elimination ofshort-range nuclear weapons in Europe.   On a related issue, Mr. Bush again defended his decisionnot to impose sanctions on the Soviet Union for its crackdownin Lithuania, and said he is glad Lithuania's leaders areindicating a willingness to suspend some laws they passed tobuttress their declaration of independence from the SovietUnion.   Mr. Bush said he considers it &quot;very, very positive&quot; thatLithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis has shown interestin a proposal from France and Germany that Lithuania suspendthe effects of some of its new laws in hopes of launchingnegotiations with the Kremlin. Mr. Bush spoke just beforemeeting privately with the prime minister of theself-proclaimed Lithuanian government, Kazimiera Prunskiene.The White House meeting was Mr. Bush's first direct contactwith a leader of Lithuania's independence movement.   The president insisted that he wasn't choosing betweensiding with Mr. Gorbachev or Lithuania. &quot;Of course, we favorself-determination&quot; for Lithuania, Mr. Bush said. &quot;I don'tthink that's new, my saying that. And of course, we favordemocracy and freedom.&quot;   But Mr. Bush again implied that he considered securingagreements with Mr. Gorbachev on issues such as gettingSoviet troops out of Eastern Europe so important that theissue of Lithuania shouldn't interfere with that effort.&quot;There's a lot at stake in all of this,&quot; he said. &quot;There'scomplications in all of this. Poland, Eastern Europe -- Iwant those troops out. And I want to see the firming up ofthe democracies in Eastern Europe.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
