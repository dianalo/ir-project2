How Soon? Experts Disagree</HEAD><BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SUNDANCE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Should we all be checking out real estatein Alaska, or are scientists who warn of catastrophic global warmingjust blowing hot air?   Sometimes it's hard to tell, admits one of those scientists. At arecent conference here on global warming, climatologist StephenSchneider displayed two New York Times articles from last January.   ``US Data Since 1895 Fail To Show Warming Trend,'' one headlineproclaimed.   ``Global Warmth In 88 Is Found To Set A Record,'' said the other.   Schneider turned to his audience and asked, ``Anybody hereconfused?''   If so, they're not alone. Ever since the hot, dry summer of 1988,the news has been full of scientists grimly predicting droughts,floods and famine if we don't act immediately to halt globalwarming. At the same time, others urge caution, saying it's foolishto solve a problem nobody has proved to exist.   While most scientists concur on the basic mechanism behind globalwarming, there is less agreement over how much or how quickly theEarth is heating up, and even less over what should be done aboutit. Now politicians and special interests have leaped into the fray,making it even harder for a concerned citizen to winnow science fromspeculation and reason from rhetoric.   Here is a look at what scientists know _ and just as importantly,don't know _ about global warming:   The underlying principle is called the greenhouse effect,familiar to anyone who has left a car with the windows rolled up ina sunny parking lot. The short-wavelength sunlight passes throughthe windows and is absorbed by the seats, which give offlong-wavelength heat radiation that's trapped by the glass.   The ``windows'' in Earth's atmosphere are gases such as carbondioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons (chemicals used inrefrigeration and aerosol products). They let sunlight through buttrap heat radiated from the ground, keeping it from escaping intospace.   ``If anyone is dubious that a greenhouse effect can bedangerous,'' says astronomer Carl Sagan, ``just point them to ourneighboring planets.'' A thin atmosphere keeps Mars in adeep-freeze, while an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide keeps Venusroasting like an oven.   Earth, meanwhile, with a moderate carbon dioxide concentration,has equable temperatures, liquid water and abundant life.   But since 1850, Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased25 percent, mostly due to burning fossil fuels. During the sameperiod, average global temperature, compiled from hundreds ofmonitoring stations, has increased about 1 degree Fahrenheit.   Cause and effect? Common sense might suggest that rising levelsof carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are responsible forglobal warming, and that is the basis of mathematical models beingused to predict future warming.   If nothing is done to reduce society's production of greenhousegases, the Earth faces the equivalent of a doubling of carbondioxide by the middle of the next century. And that, the variousmodels predict, could produce a global temperature rise of 2 to 10degrees.   The serious disagreement starts here.   Robert Jastrow, former director of the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies,questions both the accuracy of those models and the assumption thatincreasing greenhouse gases have already caused warming.   The past century's warming trend could be due to natural climatevariations or changes in the sun's brightness, he says. And presentclimate models are so coarse that their treatment of how cloudsaffect warming varies by a factor of three; such a wide discrepancycasts doubt on all the models, he says.   But Jastrow's successor at the Goddard Institute, James Hansen,is a leading supporter of the climate models. Though uncertaintiesremain, he says, they are unlikely to change his basic conclusion,``that a growing greenhouse effect will increase the frequency andseverity of the extremes of the hydrologic cycle: droughts, on theone hand, and extreme wetness and storms on the other.''   While Hansen and Jastrow argue the big picture, little nuggets ofinformation are offered up almost daily, providing fodder for eachside of the global warming debate.   Skeptics can use the first New York Times story mentioned bySchneider. It noted that U.S. temperatures since 1895 do nothing toconfirm global warming. But believers can point out that the UnitedStates occupies just 2 percent of the globe. And they can cite thesecond Times story, which said that 1988 had the warmest averageglobal temperature on record.   Each finding may be accurate, as far as it goes. But howsignificant is it?   A warm year, like 1988, may draw attention to global warming, butmost scientists now say last year's U.S. drought and heat werenatural atmospheric fluctuations caused by cyclical swings inPacific Ocean water temperatures.   Yet, the six warmest years on record all have been within thisdecade. In order, they are 1988, 1987, 1983, 1981, 1980 and 1986.   To sort out nature's fickleness from longterm trends,climatologists continually plug new factors into mathematical modelsalready so complex it takes days to run them through powerfulcomputers.   Verifying the major effects of greenhouse warming could take 10to 20 years of observation, Hansen says. By then, some scientistswarn, it may be too lae to stop greenhouse warming already in theworks.   A temperature change in the lower range of predictions might notcause catastrophic damage. But a 10-degree rise could expand oceanwater and melt enough polar ice to raise sea level nearly threefeet, flooding coastal regions worldwide, some scientists say.   Despite the uncertainties, many scientists _ and more recently,government policymakers _ have decided global warming is too much ofa risk to ignore.   In May, the White House softened its go-slow attitude to embracethe idea of a formal international treaty-negotiating process onglobal warming.   Citing a ``growing consensus'' among scientists, theEnvironmental Protection Agency in March urged the reduction ofcarbon dioxide through energy conservation techniques such asdevelopment of fuel-efficient cars, energy-saving homes and solartechnology.   But such measures can cost big money, and maneuvering has alreadybegun to protect special interests. Last month, the oil industryreleased a study that concluded natural gas heat might contributemore to the greenhouse effect than oil heat. The gas industryattacked the report as flawed and biased.   Such spirited debate, while not always enlightening, at leastkeeps the issue of global warming alive. And that, Schneider said,is key. A crisis _ last summer's heat wave _ drew attention toglobal warming. But addressing the problem will take a long-termcommitment to research and action, he said.   ``I hope that a cold, wet winter or normal summer or two won'tdeter humanity'' from learning more about global warming, he said.``The bottom line is, we insult the environment at a faster ratethan we understand the consequences.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   David Foster is the AP Northwest regionalreporter, based in Seattle.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sept. 11</NOTE></DOC>
