<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-0205 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new class of fiber optic chemical sensor is presently under developmentat the Pacific Northwest Laboratory. The new probe type, termed fiberoptic spectrochemical emission sensor (FOSES), implements either electricalspark or radio frequency excitation (via helium plasma) of analyte speciesat the probe tip for remote in situ detection. The two excitation modesoffer complementary chemical detection methods suitable for vapors, aerosols,or liquid samples. The new probe concept offers the potential for multi-pointreal-time field sampling and mapping of groundwater contamination plumesor airborne chemical contamination. This paper addresses probe designs,probe characteristics and performance, detection limits, and future conceptsfor multi-point sampling systems. 14 refs., 15 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
