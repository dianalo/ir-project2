It was a setback for possible left-of-center cooperation on the national level.    The coalition, formed 14 months ago in the prosperous industrial state of Hesse, was split over several environmental issues. It finally foundered over a quarrel about the Alkem nuclear plant at Hanau in Hesse. The plant produces nuclear fuel rods.    The antinuclear Greens' Joschka Fischer, Hesse's minister for the environment and energy, led opposition to the plant. At a party convention this past weekend, he promised to resign and pull the Greens from the coalition unless the Social Democrats agreed to close Alkem.    But Hesse's governor, Social Democrat Holger Boerner, said in a letter to Mr. Fischer yesterday that he accepted the resignation offer. He said his party wouldn't sacrifice the 500 jobs at the plant.    Mr. Boerner's decision came after the Social Democrat-run Hesse Economics Ministry decided to reissue a short-term permit to Alkem allowing it to work with highly radioactive plutonium. The decision essentially overturned a Social Democrat-Green coalition agreement for a moratorium on plutonium enrichment at the plant.    The Social Democrats have so far resisted calls to ally themselves with the Greens at a national level. Many Social Democrat moderates say the Greens are too unpredictable and uncompromising to be acceptable coalition partners. </TEXT></DOC>
