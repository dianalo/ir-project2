Environmental groups are wary that the pact could lead to damaging the pristine, ice-capped area. But the State Department, which negotiated for the U.S., sees it as a precautionary move to put orderly regulation in place before anyone attempts to mine or drill the area for commercial purposes.    There is speculation that oil, platinum and other rare metals eventually could be found in Antarctica, but there currently is an informal moratorium blocking mineral development. The area now is used primarily for scientific exploration.    The 20 countries that oversee the continent, over which there are no clear ownership rights, struck their accord last week in Wellington, New Zealand, after six years of negotiations. The pact still must be ratified by 16 nations to take effect. It is expected to be submitted to the U.S. Senate for ratification after November.    Jim Barnes, a Washington, D.C., lawyer and founder of a coalition of environmental groups concerned about Antarctica, called the treaty &quot;the first serious step to opening up that region to major industrial development.&quot; He said the pact contains &quot;quite good environmental principles,&quot; but that environmentalists are worried there aren't enough safeguards for monitoring developers and enforcing the environmental rules.    If the treaty were ratified, it would immediately allow &quot;non-intrusive&quot; prospecting activities, such as seismic tests conducted by boats or planes and shallow drilling.    However, exploration and development would need further approval, giving environmentalists a chance to lobby for blocking development. Exploration couldn't begin unless the 20 countries that are members of the Antarctic treaty unanimously agreed to open a specific area to activities such as test drilling. Commercial development then would require approval from a special 10-nation regulatory committee, which would draw up guidelines.    In contrast to current practices, in which scientists from different nations must share information they gather on Antarctica, the treaty would allow prospectors to keep information they gather confidential to protect its commercial value. </TEXT></DOC>
