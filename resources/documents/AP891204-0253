Otaiba said the United Arab Emirates was willing to reduce itscurrent output, which he put at 2.6 million barrels a day, to under2 million during the first half of 1990.   But he stressed it would not accept a quota of 1.094 millionbarrels a day assigned under an OPEC pact, reached last week.   He said the United Arab Emirates was willing to limit productionto under 2 million barrels a day if the other OPEC nations abide bytheir quotas.   The 13 OPEC members agreed last week to set their output ceilingat 22 million barrels a day. It left the quota for the United ArabEmirates, which has not complied with its OPEC quota over the pasttwo years, unchanged.   Otaiba also said he expects demand for OPEC crude to exceed 23million barrels a day in 1990, higher than the group's own demandestimates.   He said continued economic growth should keep demand strong.Moreover, recent upheaval in eastern Europe could help spur demandby touching off new economic growth there, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
