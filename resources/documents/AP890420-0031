But a Justice Department lawyer arguing in favor of banning alldial-up services offering sexually explicit telephone messages saysthe law is needed to ``protect children from hearing patentlyoffensive speech.''   The court, which heard arguments Wednesday in a California case,must determine whether the lawmakers can issue an outright ban thatfails to distinguish between indecent and obscene material.   The justices will also be looking at whether technologicalsafeguards exist to prevent children from dialing the service's 976numbers. The 976 exchanges also are used for other,non-controversial types of messages such as sport scores, timechecks and weather reports.   Born in 1983, the dial-a-porn industry matured quickly. In 1984,Justice Department Richard Taranto said, 180 million such callswere placed by customers in New York alone. The industry's incomelast year topped $2 billion, he said.   Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, representing a dial-a-pornservice known as Sable Communications, said the availability oftechnical safeguards ``makes this flat ban illegitimate.''   When Justice Byron R. White asked Tribe why Congress passed thetotal ban, Tribe responded, ``That's not a hard question, it was anelection year.''   ``I didn't say it was hard,'' White said as laughter filled thecourtroom.   The total ban on dial-a-porn never was imposed because a federaljudge in California ruled that the 1988 law could be applied onlyto obscene, not merely indecent, phone messages.   U.S. District Judge Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles saidoutlawing non-obscene messages, even though they may beinappropriate for minors, violates the free-speech protections ofthe Constitution's First Amendment. The government appealed theruling to the Supreme Court.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said Wednesday she doubted whetherthe proposed ban meets the ``least restrictive means'' test thecourt has used when scrutinizing governmental interference based onspeech content.   She asked the government's lawyer why technological safeguardssuch as scrambling devices or access codes could not provide ``afeasible and effective way to preserve the states' compellinginterest in protecting children'' while allowing adult access tosuch services.   Taranto answered that the various safeguards contain``significant loopholes.''   When Justice Antonin Scalia suggested the case involved materialon the borderline of what is constitutionally protected, Tribedisagreed.   Tribe said many of the telephone messages at issue are ``merelysuggestive'' and not at all sexually explicit.   Other dial-a-porn messages, Tribe said, cannot be distinguished``from a lot of what's in R-rated movies and racy novels.''   But Scalia responded, ``I don't think that's where the moneyis.''   Past Supreme Court decisions have excluded obscene material _but not all sexually explicit or indecent material _ fromconstitutional free-speech protections.   The court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work thatappeals to a morbid interest in sex with patently offensivedepictions or descriptions of sexual conduct, and one that taken asa whole has no serious literary, artistic, political or scientificvalue.   Congress in 1983 attempted to protect children by imposingrestrictions on dial-a-porn services but did not seek a total banuntil 1988. The ban was challenged by Sable, which offersdial-a-porn services in many states.   The 1983 measure allowed government regulators to imposerestrictions aimed at limiting children's access to dial-a-pornmessages. Those restrictions included requiring dial-a-pornservices to accept only credit card calls and to operate at timeswhen parents most likely would be available to supervise theirchildren's actions.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><TEXT/><NOTE>Eds: The case is Sable Communications vs. FCC, 88-515 and 88-525.</NOTE></DOC>
