 Harry's efforts, however, came tonaught.andP;  Not only did he make a programming error that made the virus dormantuntil 2089 instead of 1989, but he was also unaware that the telephonecompany's computer was driven by a set of preprogrammed instructions thatwere isolated from the effects of the virus.andP;  An alert computer securityofficer, aided by automated audits and alarm systems, detected and defusedHarry's logic bomb.andM;A hypothetical situation, yes, but not one outside the realm of possibility.andO;Let us suppose that Harry bragged about his feat to some friends in a bar,and a phone company employee who overheard the conversation reported theincident to the police and gave them Harry's name and address.andP;  Would Harrybe guilty of a crime?andP;  Even if Harry had committed a crime, what is thelikelihood that he could be convicted.andM;Before attempting to answer these questions, we must first know what a crimeis.andP;  A crime is an act that society, through its laws, has declared to be soserious a threat to the public order and welfare that it will punish anyonewho commits the act.andP;  An act is made criminal by being declared to be a crimein a duly enacted statute.andP;  The statute must be clear enough to givereasonable notice as to what is prohibited and must also prescribe apunishment for taking the action.andM;The elements of the crime must be spelled out in the statute.andP;  In successfulprosecution, the accused must have performed acts that demonstrate thesimultaneous presence of all of the elements of the crime.andP;  Thus, if thestatute specifies that one must destroy data to have committed an allegedcrime, but the act destroyed no data, then one cannot be convicted of thatcrime.andP;  If the act destroyed only student records of a university, but thestatute defines the crime only for a financial institution, then one cannotbe convicted under the statute.andM;All states now have criminal statutes that specifically address certain formsof computer abuse.andP;  Many misdeeds in which the computer is either theinstrument or object of the illicit act can be prosecuted as more traditionalforms of crime, such as stealing or malicious mischief.andP;  Because we cannotconsider all possible state and federal statutes under which Harry might beprosecuted, we will examine Harry's action only in terms of the federalcomputer crime statute.andM;The United States Criminal Code, title 18, section 1030(a)(3), defines ascriminal the intentional, unauthorized access to a computer used exclusivelyby the federal government, or any other computer used by the government whensuch conduct affects the government's use.andP;  The same statute, in section1030(a)(5)(A), also defines as criminal the intentional and unauthorizedaccess to two or more computers in different states, and conduct that altersor destroys information and causes loss to one or more parties of a value ofat least $1000.andM;If the phone company computer that Harry illicitly entered was not used bythe federal government, Harry cannot be charged with a criminal act undersection 1030(a)(3).andP;  If Harry accesses two computers in different states, andhis action alters information, and it causes loss to someone of a value of atleast $1000, then he can be charged under section 1030(a)(5)(A).andP;  However,whether these conditions have been satisfied may be open to question.andM;Suppose, for example, that Harry plants his logic bomb on a single machine,and that after Harry has disconnected, the program that he loaded transfers avirus to other computers in other states.andP;  Has Harry accessed thosecomputers?andP;  The law is not clear.andP;  Suppose Harry's act does not directlyalter information, but merely replicates itself to other computers on thenetwork, eventually overwhelming their processing capabilities as in the caseof the Internet virus on November 2, 1988.andP;  Information may be lost, but canthat loss be directly attributed to Harry's action in a way that satisfiesthe statute?andP;  Once again, the answer is not clear-cut.andM;And what of the $1000 required by the statute as an element of the crime?andO;How is the loss measured?andP;  Is it the cost of reconstructing any files thatwere destroyed?andP;  Is it the market value of files that were destroyed?andP;  How dowe determine these values, and what if there were adequate backups so thatthe files could be restored at minimal expense and with no loss of data?andO;Should the criminal benefit from good operating procedures on an attackedcomputer?andP;  Should the salaries of computer personnel, who would have beenpaid anyway, be included for the time they spend to bring the system upagain?andP;  If one thousand users each suffer a loss of one dollar, can oneaggregate these small losses to a loss sufficiently large to be able toinvoke the statute?andP;  The statute itself gives us noguidance so the courtswill have to decide these questions.andM;No doubt many readers consider questions such as these to be nitpicky.andP;  Manycitizens already are certain that guilty parties often use subtle legaldistinctions and deft procedural maneuvers to avoid the penalities for theiroffenses.andP;  &quot;If someone does something wrong, he or she should be punished andnot be permitted to hide behind legal technicalities,&quot; so say many.andP;  But thelaw must be the shield of the innocent as well as a weapon against themalefactor.andP;  If police were free to invent crimes at will, or a judge couldinterpret the criminal statutes to punish anyone who displeased him or her,then we would face a greater danger to our rights and freedoms than computerviruses.andP;  We cannot defend our social order by undermining the veryfoundations on which it is built.andM;The difficulties in convicting Harry of a crime, however, go beyond thequestions of whether he has simultaneously satisfied each condition of somecrime with which he can be charged.andP;  There remain the issues of prosecutorialdiscretion and the rules of evidence.andM;Prosecutors have almost absolute discretion concerning what criminal actionsthey will prosecute.andP;  That a prosecutor can refuse to charge someone with acrime, even someone against whom an airtight case exists, comes as a shock tomany citizens who assume that once the evidence exists that someone hascommitted a crime, that person will be arrested and tried.andM;There are many reasons why a prosecutor may pass up the chance to nail afelon.andP;  One is that the case-load of the prosecutor's office is tremendous,and the prosecutor must choose the criminals who pose the greatest danger tosociety.andP;  Because computer crimes are often directed against businessesrather than persons and usually carry no threat of bodily injury, they areoften seen as low priority cases by prosecutors.andP;  Even computer professionalsthemselves do not seem to think that computer crime is very serious.andP;  In a1984 survey by the American Bar Association, respondents rated computer crimeas the third least significant category of illicit activity, with onlyshoplifting and illegal immigration being lower.andP;  With such attitudes amongthose responsible for computer security, who can blame prosecutors forturning their attention to crimes the public considers to be more worthy oflaw enforcement's limited resources?andM;Underlying the assessment of priority is a general lack of understandingabout computers among prosecutors.andP;  Thus, a prosecutor would have to spend anunusual amount of time to prepare a computer crime case as opposed to a casethat dealt with a more traditional, and hence better understood, mode ofcrime.andP;  Moreover, even if the prosecutor is quite knowledgeable aboutcomputers, few judges and even fewer jurors are.andP;  The presentation of thecase, therefore, will be more difficult and time consuming, and the outcomeless predictable.andP;  I am familiar with a case that took hundreds of hours toprepare and resulted in a conviction, but the judge sentenced the convictedcriminal to pay only a small fine and serve two years probation.andP;  With such aresult, one cannot be surprised that prosecutors ignore computer criminalswhen there are so many felons that courts obviously consider more worthwhile.andM;Suppose, for the sake of argument, that we have a prosecutor who is willingto seek an indictment against Harry and bring him to trial.andP;  Even then,computer-related crimes can pose special evidentiary problems.andP;  Remember thatto convict Harry, the prosecutor must convince a jury beyond a reasonabledoubt that Harry committed an act in which all of the elements of the crimewere found simultaneously.andP;  The elements of the crime cannot be found toexist in the abstract; they must be found to apply specifically to Harry.andM;Apart from having to prove that the act caused the requisite amount of damageand that the computers used were those specified by the statute, theprosecutor would have to show that Harry committed the act and that he did sointentionally and without authorization.andP;  Because Harry was using someoneelse's account number and password, tying Harry to the crime might bedifficult unless unusual surveillance was in place.andP;  A gunman and his weaponmust be physically present at the teller's window to rob the bank, but acomputer criminal may be thousands of miles away from the computer that isattacked.andP;  A burglar must physically enter a house to carry off the loot andmay, therefore, be observed by a witness; moreover, it is generally assumedthat someone carrying a television set out of a darkened house in the middleof the night is up to no good.andP;  By contrast, a computer criminal can work inisolation and secrecy, and few, if any, of those who happen to observe arelikely to know what he is doing.andM;The evidence that ties the computer criminal to the crime, therefore, isoften largely circumstantial; what is placed before the jury is noteyewitness testimony, but evidence from which the facts can only bereasonably inferred.andP;  Although convictions on the basis of circumstantialevidence alone are possible, they are often harder to obtain.andM;Adding to the prosecutor's difficulties in getting convincing evidence aboutHarry's acts are the unsettled constitutional issues associated withgathering that evidence.andP;  Does Harry have a reasonable expectation that hiscomputer files are private?andP;  If so, then a search warrant must be obtainedbefore they can be searched and seized.andP;  If Harry's files are enciphered,then must Harry furnish the key to decryption, or would he be protected fromhaving to do so by his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination? Theevidence that would convict Harry won't do the prosecutor much good if it isthrown out as having been obtained by impermissible means.andM;In the face of these difficulties, some have introduced bills into Congressand into some state legislatures that prohibit planting a virus in a computersystem.andP;  But drafting a responsible computer crime bill is no easy task forlegislators.andP;  The first effort at federal computer crime has proscribed, andeven imposed heavy penalties for, standard computing practices.andP;  It did notclearly define what acts were forbidden.andP;  It was so broad that one could havebeen convicted of a computer crime for stealing a digital watch, and it didnot cover nonelectronic computers.andP;  The bill was never enacted.andM;If we want a statute that targets persons who disrupt computer systems byplanting viruses, then what do we look for in judging the value of proposedlegislation?andM;Is the proposed statute broad enough to cover activity that should beprohibited but narrow enough not to unduly interfere with legitimate computeractivity?andP;  Would an expert be able to circumvent the statute by designing aharmful program that would not be covered by the statute?andP;  Does the proposedstatute clearly define the act that will be punished so as to give clearnotice to a reasonable person?andP;  Does the act distinguish between intentionalacts and innocent programming errors?andP;  Does the statute unreasonablyinterfere with the free flow of information?andP;  Does it raise a First Amendmentfree speech problem?andP;  These and other questions must be considered indeveloping any new computer crime legislation.andM;Where do I personally stand with regard to legislation against viruses, logicbombs, and other forms of computer abuse?andP;  It is not enough to say I amagainst conduct that destroys valuable property and interferes with thelegitimate flow of information.andP;  The resolution of legal issues invariablyinvolves the weighing of competing interests, e.g., permitting the free flowof information v. safe-guarding a system against attack.andP;  Even now, existingcriminal statues and civil remedies are powerful weapons to deter and punishpersons who tamper with computer systems.andP;  I believe that new legislationshould be drawn with great care and adopted only after an open discussion ofits merits by informed computer professionals and users.andM;The odds are that Harry the Hacker will never be charged with a crime, or, ifcharged, will get off with a light sentence.andP;  And that is the way it willremain unless and until society judges computer crimes, be they plantingviruses or stealing money, to be a sufficiently serious threat to the publicwelfare to warrant more stringent and careful treatment.andP;  If such a timecomes, one can only hope that computing professionals and societies such asthe ACM will actively assist legislatures and law enforcement officials indealing with the problem in an intelligent and technologically competentmanner.andP;  Michael Gemignani Senior Vice President and Provost University ofHouston at Clear Lake Houston, TX 77059</TEXT></DOC>
