The system is constructed on the basis of the concept of opticalarray logic. The pure optical version of the OPALS can be realized byusing a dynamic optical coding technique and optical correlation by amulti-focus imaging system. Although the OPALS is still a conceptualsystem, it would be expected to be a prototype of optical digital computingsystems in future.</TEXT></DOC>
