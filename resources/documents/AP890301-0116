Dien, his wife and three children have languished in the campsever since they fled communist Vietnam and sailed north to thisBritish colony on the China coast seven months ago.   With dim prospects for resettlement and a gnawing concern for hisparents back home, Dien has decided his family will join 68 othervolunteers and fly to Vietnam in the first large-scale repatriationof boat people from Hong Kong.   ``I'm not clear if they (Hanoi officials) will punish us ornot,'' Dien, 30, said at the spartan Argyle Street Holding Center.``I'm not afraid.''   U.N. officials have promised to closely monitor Hanoi's treatmentof the returning boat people, and Fazlul Karim, head of the U.N.agency overseeing the repatriation, said: ``Even at the Hanoiairport if they do not want to get down from the aircraft, they willnot be dragged down.''   The fate of Dien is of more than passing interest to Hong Kong,which is straining under the weight of more than 25,000 boat people.If he is treated well, officials say, more Vietnamese may go back.   If the repatriation is successful and ``word gets back ... wehope this will lead to further requests by people in camps in HongKong to return to Vietnam,'' Secretary of Security Geoffrey Barnessaid at a news conference.   Hong Kong long has classified all boat people as refugeeseligible for resettlement, and between 1979 and 1988 only 22 of morethan 100,000 arrivals voluntarily returned home.   But to stem the growing tide of Vietnamese arrivals, Hong Kongadopted a new policy under which most boat people arriving afterJune 15 are considered illegal immigrants subject to forciblerepatriation. Only a small fraction that can prove they fledpersecution are eligible for resettlement.   More than 10,000 boat people have arrived since the change andsome have registered their displeasure with the new policy bystaging hunger strikes and refusing to be interviewed by Hong Kongofficials.   A few have even asked for new boats to head for friendlier ports,although the government is unlikely to honor the request.   Other new arrivals appear convinced their future lies back home,and about 300 names have been submitted to Hanoi, although some havesince backed out.   After the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and Vietnamsigned an agreement in December to set up a program of voluntaryrepatriation, a four-member Hanoi delegation came to Hong Kong inFebruary to issue travel documents for the first 81 boat people togo home. That number later dropped to 73 after some people backedout at the last minute.   The group is to fly home on a jet chartered from Hong Kong-basedDragon Air and be accompanied by at least one U.N. official. Eachrepatriated Vietnamese will receive a kit of basic supplies such asclothing and household utensils, said Karim, the head of the U.N.commission in Hong Kong.   ``Vietnam has said quite clearly ... there would be noprosecution or any punitive or discriminatory measures,'' Karim said.   U.N. officials will be allowed ``full access'' to monitor therepatriated boat people, he said.   Despite the assurances, only a tiny minority of boat people haveoffered to go home, and it is unclear how many more may follow.   In fact, the flow of boat people leaving Vietnam may again be onthe rise. During the first 23 days of February, 328 Vietnamesesailed into the territory, compared with 114 for all of January and91 in February 1988.   ``It certainly points to the fact that (the new policy) in and ofitself ... is obviously not a deterrent,'' said one Westerndiplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   A key deterrent in the new policy is forcible repatriation ofboat people classified as illegal immigrants, but Vietnam onlyaccepts voluntary returnees.   Akber Khan, a Hong Kong government spokesman, said beforerepatriation of boat people classified as illegal immigrants canbegin, Hanoi must agree to accept them, offer assurances of safetyand allow international monitoring of the program.   An international meeting to discuss repatriation of boat peoplewill be held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, next month, and Hanoi isexpected to attend.   Meanwhile, resettlement of the approximately 15,000 Vietnamese inHong Kong camps granted refugee status received a recent boost withseveral countries, including the United States, Australia, Canadaand Great Britain, agreeing to increase the number they accept.   Officials believe 4,000 refugees may be resettled this year, upfrom 2,772 last year and 2,212 in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
