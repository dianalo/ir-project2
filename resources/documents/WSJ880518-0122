The measure has little opposition from the White House, Reagan administration officials said, though the Justice Department strongly opposed a House version of the bill last year. The Labor Department, which backs the legislation, told conferees that the bill now satisfies administration objections to earlier polygraph legislation.    The bill would generally ban employer use of polygraphs, or lie detectors, for screening job applicants or for random testing of employees. But it would permit pharmaceutical companies and companies that employ security guards to do pre-employment and random testing. The conferees adopted those exemptions included in the House bill, while scrapping some exemptions that were contained in the Senate version.    But conforming with an important thrust of the Senate bill, the conference measure would generally restrict polygraph tests for most employers to situations in which the company has some evidence of theft or other wrongdoing that causes economic loss or injury, as well as evidence that the employee to be tested may have been involved.    An employer could run those lie-detector tests only as part of a continuing investigation, and would have to show the worker to be tested a statement describing the loss and the basis of the company's suspicion that the worker may be involved. Conferees dropped a previous Senate bill requirement that an employer make a formal report, such as one to the police or a regulatory agency.    The employer wouldn't be able to fire a worker or take other adverse action against the employee based on the test results or any worker refusal to take the polygraph examination, unless there is other evidence against him. Before any such action, the employee must be further interviewed on the basis of the test results, given a written copy of any conclusion by the employer based on the test, and given a copy of the questions asked in the test and the worker's charted responses.    Of a raft of labor-backed measures pending in Congress, the polygraph bill is the only one that appears certain to be enacted this year. It was passed by large margins by both the House and Senate, with strong bipartisan backing for curbing widely unpopular lie-detector tests, which many critics say are unreliable. Backers said the bill is necessary to prevent employers from intruding on worker privacy and using polygraphs as a means to intimidate employees.    The bill &quot;will offer long-overdue protections for millions of employees and job applicants (and) long-overdue standards for those tests not prohibited by the legislation,&quot; said Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor Committee.    Unions and civil-liberties groups vigorously supported the measure, while it was opposed by such industries as trucking, security and retail concerns, including sellers of drugs, jewelry and other valuable items.    The bill would prohibit about 85% of lie-detector tests that are now given. </TEXT></DOC>
