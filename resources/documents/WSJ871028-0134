But the country that may have helped bring on the crash is a relative isle of tranquillity.    &quot;People aren't flipping out here&quot; in Germany, says Thomas Holmes, a Frankfurt stock broker. The market's plunge, he adds, &quot;is a curiosity for most Germans.&quot;    Germans aren't inclined to take risks. When it comes to investing their money, they avoid stocks and favor such less-risky investments as savings accounts, life insurance and bonds. While stock ownership has increased in recent years as prices have boomed on world bourses, only 5% of the population holds shares. In the U.S., one in four people does.    This aversion to risk is mirrored in the nation's policy making. Monetary authorities take with deep seriousness paragraph three of the law that created the Bundesbank, which establishes a legally binding mission for the central bank to uphold the value of property and promote price stability. While the bank has been true to its charter, it has fought inflation too effectively, in the view of most of the world and even some Germans.    &quot;There's a total preoccupation with price stability in this country and a total distrust of any sort of policies that might bolster consumer demand,&quot; asserts economist Dieter Wermuth, who says he has been rebuked by fellow German economists for voicing such sentiment. &quot;Germany should do more to stimulate its economy. But the Bundesbank commits suicide out of fear that one day it may die.&quot;    Now, the collapse of the world's financial markets threatens to intensify demands on West Germany to stimulate the international economy. Just this week, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, urged the Germans to &quot;show more obvious awareness&quot; of the dangers of a tight monetary policy.    By raising interest rates over the past few months, critics contend that the Bundesbank violated at least the spirit of the February Louvre accord in which the major industrialized nations pledged to strive for greater monetary stability. It also fueled market doubts about Germany's commitment to economic-policy coordination with the U.S. That, in turn, prompted U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's outburst against the Germans, which exacerbated, if not triggered, the crisis. The Bundesbank subsequently appeared to placate Mr. Baker by reaffirming a commitment against higher interest rates.    In Washington, where irritation already exists in some circles over Germany's refusal to support the U.S. militarily in the Persian Gulf, events on Wall Street raise the prospect that Germany could become the new target of congressional fingerpointing.    Yet, curiously, few German leaders appear worried about a backlash against them in America. There is little concept at all that Germany might, indeed, be viewed as a guilty party in contributing to the stock market crash. They figure that they know best how to handle their economy and that the last country that should be offering advice is the U.S., which hasn't been able to get its own economic house in order.    Washington made some &quot;very big mistakes&quot; by adhering rigidly to a policy of cutting taxes, says Bundesbank board member Norbert Kloten. Moreover, the &quot;bulk of American industry isn't as modern as it should be,&quot; a factor that, according to Mr. Kloten, has contributed to the U.S. trade deficit.    &quot;We are aware of our international obligations and we willingly accept them,&quot; the banker observes. But the Bundesbank, he asserts, has to be &quot;very cautious&quot; in setting its monetary policy. &quot;From our point of view, we already have a permissive policy,&quot; he says.    Most Germans have been deeply suspicious of President Reagan's economic policies from the outset. When the Kohl government assumed power five years ago, its prescription for economic recovery was to impose austerity and lower deficits, not cut taxes and widen deficits. Although Germany's economy will probably only grow at about half the rate of the U.S. this year, Bonn officials take comfort in their record trade balance and near-zero inflation. These, for them, prove the soundness of their strategy.    Indeed, there is almost universal agreement inside Germany that the government is conducting its economic policy properly. Germans view deficits as profligacy and consider any policy that worsens them to be unsound. They look on the current stockmarket crash as a repudiation of Reaganomics, not an indictment of German economic policy.    &quot;I have had deep reservations about U.S. economic policy ever since Reagan took office. It just wasn't reasonable,&quot; says Meinhard Miegel, director of the Institute for Economic and Social Policy, a Bonn-based think tank affiliated with the ruling Christian Democratic Party. &quot;We are already paying the price for that policy through higher real interest rates.&quot;    A member of the opposition Social Democratic Party, economist Ulrich Steger, adds, &quot;Germany is going to come under more criticism from the U.S. but I don't think it is justified. The United States created this mess with its budget deficits. It was a risky policy and it backfired.&quot;    Aversion to risk is deeply rooted in the German psyche. People tend to resist changing careers, and they expect the government to show a similar continuity in pursuing its policies. German businessmen often express disbelief that an American can fail in one venture and still be able to obtain financing for a second.    German capital markets are undeveloped compared with those in the other two economic powerhouses of the industrialized democracies, the U.S. and Japan. German stock exchanges prohibit short-selling of securities; no financial-futures exchange exists as yet, and options trading is only slowly developing. Stocks are normally traded only two hours daily (although the trading day in Frankfurt has been extended by one hour lately to handle the greater volume).    There may be other psychological factors at work in shaping Germany's national behavior. Since the fall of Hitler's Third Reich, the country has played a deliberately low-key role in international affairs, preferring conciliation over confrontation.    Moreover, some people suggest that because Germany is so hamstrung in the conduct of foreign policy, it is perhaps becoming more aggressive in asserting its economic independence. Others say they detect a more self-assertive Germany emerging generally as part of a coming to terms with the Nazi past. A few voices worry the self-assertiveness might contain a trace of self-satisfaction.    Says Kurt Biedenkopf, a prominent Christian Democrat, &quot;We have in Germany right now a bit of a smugness and I find that distressing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
