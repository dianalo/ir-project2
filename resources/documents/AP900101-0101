No pickup</NOTE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Israeli immigration agency reported Mondaythat 71,509 Jews emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1989, thehighest number in two decades.   Of the emigrants, 11,994 have settled in Israel, the most sincethe early 1970s, according to figures released by the JewishAgency, a quasi-governmental organization funded by Jews overseasthat handles the newcomers in Israel.   The highest monthly emigration figure last year was registeredin November when 11,170 Soviet Jews have left the country, thefigures showed. Of these, 1,828 came to Israel.   In December 1989, 3,500 Jews came to Israel out of 8,540 wholeft the Soviet Union. In 1988, only 2,173 settled in Israel. In1987, the figure was 2,069.   Israeli officials predict that 30,000 to 50,000 Soviet Jews willarrive in 1990 because of liberalized emigration laws and new U.S.immigration restrictions.   The first 125 Soviet immigrants this year arrived Monday on adirect flight from Moscow aboard Israel's El Al airline, makingthem the first Soviet Jews to immigrate directly to Israel from theSoviet Union.   The immigrants had waited for 10 days to come to Israel viaRomania. They received permission Sunday to join the return flightthat brought Israel's Habima national theater to the Soviet Union.   Israel and the Soviet Union signed an agreement last month tobegin direct flights between the two countries.   El Al president Rafi Har-lev greeted the 125 immigrants at theairport and said he hoped regularly scheduled flights will beginsoon.   As many as 300,000 Soviet immigrants are expected in Israel inthe next three years. The cost of settling the immigrants isestimated at $3 billion, with U.S. and other Jews abroad expectedto contribute $500 million of that.</TEXT></DOC>
