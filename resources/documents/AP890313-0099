After walking from his wheelchair to a row of microphones 15 feetaway, Brady, known to his friends as ``Bear,'' pronounced himselfready for work.   ``My eight years of rehabilitation and PT _ pain and torture _are now over, and I'm anxious to get on with this new assignment,''Brady said at a news conference. ``The Bear is back, for good now,and you'll be hearing from me often.''   Brady, who retired from his White House job earlier this year,said he accepted an unpaid position as vice chairman of the NationalOrganization on Disability, a private, non-profit group promotingthe interests of the disabled.   ``Now that I'm one of the 37 million people with disabilities, Iknow what it's like: the daily frustration and problems,'' he said.``My family and I have been fortunate over the past eight years tohave the support of friends, family and people from all across thecountry. That support system has been invaluable to me in myrecovery.   ``Now, I want to help provide a support system for others.''   Both President Bush and Reagan sent congratulatory messages toBrady _ Bush in a letter and Reagan in a telegram.   ``Your comeback has made us all proud,'' Bush wrote. ``You neverlost your determination to recover, your patient disposition or yourwonderful sense of humor.''   Brady, 48, was shot in the head on March 30, 1981, during anattempt on the life of Reagan and has been receiving therapy sincethen.   Reagan kept him in the title of press secretary, and he continuedto receive his salary of $89,500 a year as an assistant to thepresident. He reported to the White House about one day a week tovisit with associates, sign autographs and pose for pictures.   He has held several government jobs since coming to Washington in1973 as a communications consultant to the House, and is eligiblefor a government pension.   ``Serving as a volunteer, Jim will participate in board meetings,work with the media on disability matters _ especially in improvingattitudes toward disabled persons _ and strengthen our relationshipswith corporate, governmental and community groups,'' said AlanReich, president of the National Organization on Disability.   In addition to the volunteer job, Brady said he is consideringwriting a regular newspaper column ``that might help sensitize morepeople'' and also has discussed the possibility of working with theadministration on issues affecting the disabled.   ``When you are one, you learn the frustrations and all the cutsand all the slights and everything that everyone else goesthrough,'' he said. ``You vow then to make it better, and that'swhat I'm going to try to do.''</TEXT></DOC>
