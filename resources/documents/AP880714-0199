Strikes in Armenia itself began July 4.   Three-quarters of the territory's 160,000 residents are ethnicArmenians, but the region, roughly the size of Delaware, wasassigned to Azerbaijan in 1923.   Police in Moscow arrested 15 protesters who unfurled the Latvianflag and several protest banners near the Kremlin. They weredemonstrating on behalf of Baltic nationalities and Ukrainians aswell as Armenians.   In Yerevan, the Armenian capital, 150,000 people gatheredThursday night outside a historical institute, Gagik Aghasarian, anArmenian architect who attended the rally, said in a telephoneinterview.   They called on the republic's 10 deputies to the nation'scentral parliament to press for annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, hesaid.   Armenians believe the Presidium, or executive committee, of theSupreme Soviet, the highest legislative body in the Sovietgovernment, will meet Monday to consider the Nagorno-Karabakhquestion.   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfilyev saidsuch a meeting was likely but that he didn't know when it wouldoccur.   The names and workplaces of the 10 Armenian deputies were readout at the Yerevan rally so members of the crowd could contact themand ``express the wish of the people that Karabakh is annexed toArmenia,'' Aghasarian said.   Police in Moscow arrested 15 protesters who unfurled the Latvianflag and several protest banners near the Kremlin. They weredemonstrating on behalf of Baltic nationalities and Ukrainians aswell as Armenians.   The party worker in Nogorno-Karabakh said in a telephoneinterview that paramilitary police were deployed in rural areas.Perfilyev told reporters the situation was tense in the region.   A resident of Stepanakert, the territorial capital, said peoplewere suffering because of the job actions resulting from months ofethnic turmoil over the region's fate.   ``Our situation is very bad because the strike is continuing. Noone is working,'' said the resident, a woman who hung up the phonebefore giving her name.   She said Nagorno-Karabakh residents had to rely on food producedlocally. ``We aren't receiving food from Azerbaijan or Armenia,''she said, but ``we get some potatoes from the Stepanakert area.''   Rem Ananikyan, deputy chief of Armenia's official news agencyArmenpress, said by telephone from Yerevan that more than 200,000people attended a rally Wednesday night.   Armenians have defied Azerbaijan and central authorities all theway up to Mikhail S. Gorbachev with a 5-month-old campaign to annexNagorno-Karabakh. Despite its preponderance of Armenians, most ofwhom are Christians, the region was given to predominantly MoslemAzerbaijan 65 years ago.   Khovik Vasilyan, an Armenian activist and former politicalprisoner, said Armenians learned from television late Wednesdaythat Azerbaijan's government had quashed the previous day'sdecision by Nagorno-Karabakh's legislature to secede fromAzerbaijan and join Armenia. He is foreman in a state company thatmakes farm buildings.   The Presidium of Azerbaijan's parliament declared Tuesday night,a few hours after the legislators acted, that the secession wasillegal.   Ananikyan, the news agency executive, said the Yerevandemonstrators ``demanded that this decision be resolved, that thestrike be continued.''   Strikes in Armenia began July 4. Ananikyan said publictransportation was running normally Thursday in Yerevan, a city of1.1 million people, but strikes continued in many factories.   Vasilyan said from Yerevan, also by telephone: ``Basically, theentire republic is not working.''   Pravda, the national Communist Party daily, said Thursday thework stoppage in Armenia has caused the equivalent of $65 millionin lost production and that construction worth $29 million had notbeen completed.   Ananikyan said speakers at Wednesday's rally called for thestrike to continue until Monday.   The party worker in Stepanakert, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said the paramilitary police ``are helping us normalizethe situation, but it's calm here.''   Moscow radio said police were investigating Nagorno-Karabakhresidents who had manufactured or acquired weapons, but did not saywhat the arms were for. Perfilyev said the confiscations were aprecautionary move.   Thirty-two people were killed in ethnic riots in February atSumgait, Azerbaijan _ 26 of them Armenians.   The demonstrators in Moscow released a statement urgingauthorities to resolve the dispute.   Dissident journalist Sergei I. Grigoryants was among thosearrested Thursday. Others included representatives of informalpolitical groups from Estonia and Lithuania, and Ukrainian humanrights activists.   They were taken to a police post, held for five hours and freed,dissident Alexei Manamnikov said by telephone. He said Grigoryantsand three others were ordered to appear in court next week, but thecharges were not known.</TEXT></DOC>
