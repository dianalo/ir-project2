(in dispute)is the president's insistence on giving a new gift to the higherrollers in this society,'' Rep. David Obey, D-Wis, told reportersTuesday.   However, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said the Democrats'argument against cutting taxes on capital gains, which are profitsfrom the sale of investments, was simply wrong.   ``Let's dispel any notion that the Republican capital-gains tax(reduction) is to help the rich,'' he said. ``We're supposed to getgrowth out of this budget.''   As Democrats accused Bush and his party of risking a deficitagreement to win on capital gains, the president sent his topnegotiators to the Capitol to discuss the next step in trying toavoid massive, arbitrary cuts in most federal programs startingOct. 1.   White House and congressional negotiators working on a plan tocut the deficit by $50 billion next year hit an impasse Mondaynight after reaching tentative agreement on several spending cutsand tax increases.   They met for an hour in the Capitol Tuesday, and agreed tocontinue working toward a compromise.   If the capital-gains issue could be settled, said SenateMajority Leader George J, Mitchell, D-Maine, ``the rest would cometogether quickly.''   Domenici said, ``There are a number of hangups.''   He noted Republicans have proposed to offset part of thecapital-gains reduction by limiting the state and local income taxdeductions available to people with incomes over $200,000. When thetwo items are combined, he said, ``I don't see how that's helpingthe rich.''   Still, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., declared that acapital-gains cut ``is an ideological obsession of the right wingof the Republican party and unfortunately the president has yieldedto it.''   Economic growth has been Bush's argument for the reduction sincehe proposed it during his 1988 campaign. Some economists agree thatreducing the tax would give people with money incentives for makingnew investments that could create jobs. Others say there is noevidence for such a claim.   But the question of cutting the tax has been fought on anotherpoint. Democratic leaders cite estimates that nearly 80 percent ofthe benefit would go to those with incomes over $100,000 a year.   Democrats note that higher-income people benefited greatly frommajor tax laws enacted in 1981 and 1986. The 70 percent top taxrate on their investment income was slashed to 28 percent as wasthe 50 percent top rate on their wages.   The latest GOP proposal would cut the maximum capital-gains rateto 15 percent.   A study by the labor-financed Citizens for Tax Justice providedopponents this argument against a capital-gains reduction: The492,000 richest 1 percent of families, with incomes averaging$737,000, would reap a tax cut averaging nearly $20,000 a year. The40 million families with incomes under $61,000 would see a tax cutaveraging $30.   Bush and other backers of the reduction bristle at sucharguments. ``I am sick and tired of the demagogues who call this atax cut for the rich,'' Bush said earlier this year. ``It meansjobs, it means savings and it is good for all Americans.''   Republicans note that millions of less-than-wealthy Americansare likely to receive a capital gain at some time in their lives.They say the statistics do not tell the whole story, since a$50,000-a-year family that received a one-time $60,000 gain fromselling a family business would be listed in that year as among theover-$100,000-a-year group.   Capital gains enjoyed preferential tax treatment until the taxcode was thoroughly rewritten in 1986. As a price for cuttingindividual income-tax rates across the board, Congress andthen-President Reagan agreed to take away or reduce numerousspecial benefits, ranging from the deduction for state and localsales taxes to the capital-gains preference.   In its explanation of the new law, Congress concluded that thelower overall rates eliminated the need for a special lower rate oncapital gains. In addition, the report stated, treating capitalgains like other income ``will result in a tremendous amount ofsimplification for many taxpayers.''   Restoring a special capital-gains rate, Democrats say, wouldmean reneging on the 1986 bargain that special provisions should begiven up in favor of lower rates.</TEXT></DOC>
