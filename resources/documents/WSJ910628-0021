The two products, MVP and M-Trak, enhance the performanceof a naturally occurring insecticide, Bacillus thuringensis,San Diego-based Mycogen said. Rising consumer concerns aboutfood, soil and water contamination have spurred demand formore biopesticides.</LP><TEXT>   MVP kills the diamondback moth and other caterpillar peststhat attack cabbage, broccoli, lettuce and other crops.M-Trak's main target is the Colorado potato beetle. Mycogensaid its proprietary technology used in the new pesticidesmake them more persistent than conventional biopesticides,which tend to degrade quickly in the environment.   Pesticides that use recombinant DNA techniques arecontroversial due to concerns about the possible release oflive organisms into the environment. But Mycogen has saidthat the toxic bacteria in its pesticides cannot multiply orspread because they are encased in dead-cell capsules,similar to gelatin capsules in human medicine.   &quot;Extensive scientific studies on these two microbialpesticides have undergone careful review by the EPA, and weare satisfied that use of these products according to labeldirections will pose no danger to public health or to theenvironment,&quot; said Linda Fisher, assistant administrator forpesticides and toxic substances.</TEXT></DOC>
