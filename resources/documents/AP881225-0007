(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Attorneys for two American Indians chargedwith kidnapping in the takeover of a newspaper office are urging NewYork authorities to investigate corruption charges in a NorthCarolina county.   ``We are hopeful that Gov. (Mario) Cuomo will respond positivelyto the phone calls and telegrams he's been getting,'' said AllenGregory, an attorney for Christic Institute South, which isrepresenting Timothy Jacobs. ``We hope he will have his attorneygeneral investigate drug trafficking and corruption in RobesonCounty.''   Jacobs, 20, fled to New York after being indicted on 14 counts ofsecond-degree kidnapping by a special session of the Robeson Countygrand jury Dec. 6. He was arrested in Oneida, N.Y., a week later andreleased to the Onondaga Indian Nation Reservation under $25,000bond. An extradition hearing is scheduled Jan. 12 in New York.   Eddie Hatcher, 31, who was indicted on the same charges, said aweek ago that he had also fled to the reservation because his lifehad been threatened in Robeson County. He had been arrested Dec. 6and was freed on $25,000 bond. He is scheduled to appear Jan. 16 atthe Robeson County Superior Court in Lumberton, 100 miles south ofRaleigh.   The National Council of Churches paid bonds for both men.   The indictments came less than two months after they wereacquitted of federal hostage-taking charges in the Feb. 1 takeoverof The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton.   Up to 20 people were held as hostages for 10 hours while Hatcherdemanded an investigation of alleged drug trafficking by lawenforcement officers and corruption in local government.   The siege ended after Gov. Jim Martin agreed to form a state taskforce to investigate the charges, but Martin said last week all thetask force found was ``rumors and gossip.''   Martin said Hatcher, Jacobs and their supporters were attemptingto win public sympathy by claiming that they are the victims ofpolitical persecution. ``All of the rhetorical excess in the worldis not going to persuade me that they should not face thosecharges,'' Martin said. ``What they did was endanger the lives ofthose people.''   But attorneys for Jacobs say an investigation of Robeson Countyby New York authorities would show that Jacobs was telling the truthabout corruption there and that he would be in danger if he wasextradited back to North Carolina.   Cuomo was not in his office this week and other New Yorkofficials declined to comment on the request for an investigation.   Lawyers for Christic Institute South, of Carrboro, met with NorthCarolina Attorney General Lacy Thornburg after the federal trial toask for an investigation of Robeson County. But Thornburg told themthe county had been part of a long-running investigation of drugtrafficking.   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bruce, who prosecuted the twoIndians in federal court, said their efforts had hindered federalinvestigations.   Hatcher and Jacobs have charged that the state indictments are a``vindictive'' act by District Attorney Joe Freeman Britt, afrequent target of minority critics. Britt, who leaves theprosecutor's office Jan. 1 to become a Superior Court judge, hascalled the charge ``ridiculous.''   Richard Townsend, an assistant district attorney named last weekto succeed Britt, said he intends to continue the prosecution, butsaid he has had little time to study the kidnapping case.   ``Obviously, we're going to proceed with the extradition of Mr.Jacobs,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
