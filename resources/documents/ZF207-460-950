Byers: other notables who have ended upat the venture capital company include Andy Heller, former IBM AIX Unix guru,and Floyd Kvamme, the former president of National Advanced Systems, and oneof the original founders of National Semiconductor.andM;-  o  -andM;Having caught up with the fact that IBM pulled the &quot;3390&quot; diskandM;drive announcement at the last minute - reported here last Friday (CI No1,224) and now confirmed by IBM, although it won't say what the problems areor when the drives will now be announced - analysts are taking a verynegative view of the delay, and do not believe that IBM will now be able tostart shipping the things before next year &quot;IBM is putting together aninterim marketing plan, and you don't put one together if you're just goingto have a 30-day slip,&quot; SoundView Financial analyst Steve Cohen commented tothe Wall Street Journal; analysts had factored in $1,500m to $1,800m ofbusiness from the drives for the fourth quarter, and IBM will want to getthat from somewhere else if possible, which means that whatever plans it hadfor kickers for the 3090 or schedules for announcing Summit may well now bealtered.andM;-  o  -andM;In what begins to look like a serious threat for the future toandM;IBM's hegemony in the large-scale database market with DB2, Teradata Corp,the Los Angeles company that builds enormous back- end database processorsusing arrays of microprocessors from the Intel iAPX-86 family, this weekreported sales for the year to June 30 up 53% at $137.4m, which means that itis now bigger than companies such as highly-rated minisupercomputer builderConvex Computer Corp - in its most recent quarter, Teradata did a cool $50m,Convex did $37.4m, and the problem for IBM is that each sale made by Teradatain competition with DB2 on a 3090 costs IBM substantially more business thanthe value of the sale to Teradata.andM;-  o  -andM;Not that Convex Corp is doing badly, with first quarter sales upandM;48% and $53m in the bank: indeed the Richardson, Texas company is doing sowell that venture capitalist L J Sevin reckons it's time  to take a backseat, and has ceded his post of chairman to president and chief executiveRobert Paluck, although he remains a director and investor.andM;-  o  -andM;Amstrad Plc approached STC Plc chairman Arthur Walsh proposingandM;some kind of equity alliance between the two companies but was rebuffed,Channel Four's Business Daily is claiming: the approach had nothing to dowith the proposed alliance on Personal Communications Networks, the programmeimplied; in the past, the Amstrad name has been seriously linked with that ofGEC.andM;Fuelled by a bearish feature in Barrons magazine which highlighted CompaqComputer Corp as vulnerable, there has been a flurry of worry that thepersonal computer market is heading for the buffers, but if a personalcomputer recession is coming, Compaq's second quarter figures show that ithasn't reached the Houston company yet (see page five): in fact, it is prettyclear that the personal computer market is soft on both sides of the water,but that there has been a flight to quality that has benefitted Compaq mostof all - more than IBM because of doubts about the Micro Channel; if realrecession bites, Compaq's breakneck growth rate will inevitably slow, and thestrong dollar clearly hurt foreign translations in the second quarter, wheresales outside the US were 44% of the total against 46% in the first quarterand 39% for all of 1988; Dataquest figures covering the main European marketsput Compaq number two behind IBM in personal computers for business with10.2% of the market.andM;-  o  -andM;ATandamp;E Corp shares duly took a hit on Motorola Inc's announcementandM;that it is developing a wristwatch pager (CI No 1,227), falling $3.125 to$10.375, but the San Francisco company was quick to distance its own productfrom the Motorola one, saying that it transmits data at 19.2Kbps, whileMotorola's product is based on 30-year-old technology and transmits at 600bpsto 1,200bps - &quot;in telecommunications terms, it is like comparing the twistedwires of 30 years ago with the fibre optics of today,&quot; it said, adding thatits own system &quot;has been designed to have a capacity significantly in excessof existing paging systems&quot;; the downside for ATandamp;E is Motorola's big existingpaging customer base.andM;-  o  -andM;In saying it is prepared to recommend an offer of $127.50 a shareandM;from McCaw Cellular Communications subject to negotiation of definitiveagreement, LIN Broadcasting Corp has set a deadline of Monday.andM;-  o  -andM;Pacific Telesis International Inc and Masada UK Cable Partners ofandM;Birmingham, Alabama are the principal shareholders in the companies that havebeen granted UK cable television franchises for Norwich and for Peterborough:the two cover about 140,000 homes; Pacific Telesis and Jones Intercable arealso investors in the East London Telecommunications Ltd cable franchise.andM;-  o  -andM;Unhappy that word of Sinclair Research Ltd's challenging 250 MIPSandM;unversal emulator RISC chip come out prematurely (CI No 1,205), Sir CliveSinclair is even more unhappy that the whole thing had been attributed toChris Shelton: it was all his own idea he told PC Dealer.andM;-  o  -andM;Cray Research Inc's second quarter figures - profits slumping 77%andM;on sales down 4.5% (see page five) - were considerably worse than the companyhad expected: in May it said it expected turnover to grow 10% this yeardespite a weak performance in the first quarter; it attributed its changedoutlook to &quot;competitive and economic conditions&quot; as well as delays in gettingcontracts signed for systems that are to be installed this year, and as a result, earnings &quot;will continue to be under pressure&quot; and it will &quot;be achallenge&quot; to match the $3.53 a share it did in the second half of last year;problems cited include a reduction in gross margins due to higher trade-inallowances and scrapping rather than reselling of older systems returned offlease or taken as trade-ins, plus costs associated with the Cray-3 project,due to be spun off.andM;-  o  -andM;Ashton-Tate Corp president Luther Nussbaum's resignation (CI NoandM;1,227) was triggered by differences in &quot;management philosophy&quot;: the $19.6mloss (see page five) on sales down 21% in the fourth quarter was $5m worsethan the company had warned it would be last month.andM;-  o  -andM;Microsoft Corp told analysts this week that while it wasandM;comfortable with projections of $1,000m turnover in fiscal 1990 to June 30,some forecasts for earnings for the year just started were too high: thecompany's revenues are shifting away from systems software products andtowards retail application products, forecast to be 49% of the total thisyear, up from 42% in the year just ended; there is a much higher selling andmarketing cost associated with applications sales, the company said, so thatit would very difficult to maintain its traditional 20% plus margins.andM;-  o  -andM;Seems the evil godfathers who contemptuously send the unbalancedandM;and the emotionally immature out to bomb and murder - and would see to itthat the members of the &quot;active service units&quot; were the first to go to thewall if their revolution were to succeed - have infiltrated DesktopPublishing Show in London this October: according to the Sunday Telegraphstar billing is given to a &quot;PIRA seminar&quot;, and points out that the onlywidely known term that that acronym stands for is the Provisional Wing of theIrish Republican Army - steer well clear.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
