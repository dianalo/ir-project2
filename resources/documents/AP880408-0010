Walsh is beingattacked in opposite directions by the Iran-Contra defendants, withone claiming he improperly ignored congressional testimony and theother three saying he illegally used it.   Attorneys representing former national security adviser John M.Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and arms dealer Albert Hakimmoved Thursday to dismiss the indictment against them, claimingWalsh illegally relied on testimony the three gave last year to theIran-Contra congressional committees after being granted limitedimmunity. Because of the immunity grants, Walsh was required tocollect all of his evidence independently.   North, Piondexter and Hakim claim that, given the massivepublicity surrounding the hearings, Walsh's case was inevitablytainted by exposure to their immunized _ regardless of efforts toinsulate investigators and grand jurors from that evidence.   But lawyers for retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord,the fourth defendant, claim that Walsh unfairly ignored thecongressional testimony of North and Poindexter. They say thattestimony would have led the grand jury to decline to name theirclient in the 23-count indictment.   Secord, who brokered the arms sales with Hakim, was the leadwitness at last year's televised hearings of the House and SenateIran-Contra committees and testified without any immunity.   All four defendants are accused of conspiring to divert profitsillegally from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.   The so-called ``use immunity'' grants conferred by Congress onNorth, Poindexter and Hakim prohibit Walsh from using evidenceobtained directly or indirectly from their congressional testimony.   Walsh imposed special precautions to prevent his staff and thegrand jury from being exposed to the extensive publicitysurrounding the hearings. Prosecutors and grand jurors alike weretold to ignore news reports or conversations with friends about thehearings.   Evidence was filed under seal in U.S. District Court to provethat it was obtained independently of the immunized testimony.   But in pleadings filed with U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell, lawyers for North, Poindexter and Hakim said thoseprecautions were not enough.   ``Never in the history of this nation has the immunizedtestimony of putative defendants been broadcast live, on all majornetworks, to tens of millions of viewers and listeners,'' thedefense said.   ``Given the widespread dissemination of immunized testimonythroughout our society, the broad use of immunized testimony hasbeen inevitable, undeniable, and so pervasive that the indictmentmust be dismissed as a matter of law,'' the defense argued.   As an alternative to dismissing the charges, the defense askedGesell to conduct a hearing to determine if immunized congressionaltestimony influenced Walsh's investigation.   The defense says it wants to question grand jurors to determineif they learned about the congressional hearings from friends,relatives or news broadcasts or from grand jury witnesses.   Secord's lawyers are taking a different course. They contendthat Walsh unfairly refused to consider the congressional testimonyof North and Poindexter, which they contend would vindicate theirclient of any wrongdoing.   The grand jury should have had an opportunity to consider thistestimony before returning an indictment against Secord, hislawyers said.   ``The independent counsel's decision to exalt prosecutorialconvenience above General Secord's Fifth Amendment right to a fairand informed grand jury taints the proceedings against him andrequires, as a matter of fundamental fairness, that the indictmentbe dismissed,'' Secord's lawyers said.   Gesell has scheduled a hearing next Tuesday to discuss theimmunity issue, which could take months to resolve.</TEXT></DOC>
