Sen. Simon (D., Ill.) said he would &quot;leave the field of active campaigning with no regrets.&quot; Sen. Simon, who has some 170 delegates from his win in Illinois and second-place finish in Iowa, said he will meet with his delegates after the last primaries June 7 &quot;to determine what course should be followed.&quot;    &quot;I will make no decision on formally withdrawing as a candidate until&quot; then, he added, &quot;though I have no illusions that the nomination will come my way.&quot;    In the past few days, Mr. Robertson, a former religious broadcaster, has lost his right to federal matching funds, relinquished his secret-service protection and drastically pared his schedule of appearances. A spokeswoman said he acknowledges that &quot;it appears that George Bush will be the nominee,&quot; although he has made no statement about the status of his campaign.    Once thought to be a come-from-behind threat to Mr. Bush on the strength of an &quot;invisible army&quot; of evangelical Christian voters, Mr. Robertson's campaign scored a surprise second-place finish in Iowa but then lost steam. He won only 19 delegates but will press the GOP to adopt his brand of conservatism through speeches around the country prior to the convention in August. </TEXT></DOC>
