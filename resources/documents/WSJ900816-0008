Abundant supplies of U.S. grain crops and declining exportdemand are likely to keep most agricultural commodity pricegains modest. A slowdown in world economic growth and inmetal consumption also will hold back price gains for metalsfutures and related industrial products.</LP><TEXT>   An index of prices for 23 commodities that excludes oiland gold has declined 2% in value since July 1, despiteevents in the Mideast, according to Commodity Research BureauInc. &quot;The commodity markets are trying to tell us that thisis a temporary oil shock that will not cause overall higherinflation,&quot; said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear,Stearns andamp; Co.   Even if oil prices remain near current levels a year fromnow, other commodity markets aren't expected to feel muchinflationary heat. By that time, oil prices would have pushedthe economies of many countries into recession, which wouldcurtail demand for most commodities.   The following is a survey of price trends in a half-dozencommodity futures markets:                                                                                                          Wheat                                                                                                          Favorable weather patterns and &quot;abysmal&quot; export demandhave depressed U.S. wheat futures prices about 30% in thepast year, says Daniel Basse, director of market research forAgResource Co., Chicago. Just last week, the AgricultureDepartment said it expects the harvest for the crop yearended June 30 to total 2.71 billion bushels. That would be a33% jump from the year-earlier drought-shriveled harvest. Bynext June, U.S. wheat stockpiles are expected to reach 846million bushels, up from a drought-reduced 542 million forthe year just ended.   Meanwhile, the Soviet Union is predicting a near-recordgrain crop this season. Even if millions of bushels rot inthe fields because of bureaucratic bungling and scarce fuelfor harvest machinery, the crop is expected to reduce Sovietgrain imports from all sources by 20% through mid-1991. Ascarcity of hard-currency reserves is also curtailingMoscow's imports. Other importers, eyeing mounting wheatstockpiles world-wide, aren't rushing to place orders withU.S. suppliers, either.                                                                                                          Corn                                                                                                          The same trends pushing wheat futures lower are weighingon corn futures prices. A wet spring delayed planting in manyregions, but favorable conditions since then are expected toresult in a 4% increase in this year's crop to 7.85 billionbushels. Year-end stockpiles are expected to grow as well, to1.33 billion bushels from 1.22 billion a year earlier. Sovietcorn imports are likely to tail off in line with wheatimports.                                                                                                          Sugar                                                                                                          Unlike wheat and corn stockpiles, sugar supplies arerelatively tight after two years of strong demand. Butbecause Iraq is a major sugar importer, sugar futures pricesplunged on news of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Prices bouncedback somewhat in subsequent days as traders decided thesell-off had gone too far.   Rumors of recent export demand are also supporting prices,although U.S. buyers appeared to back away as pricesapproached 11 cents a pound in recent days, says CharlesKolligian, a futures trader with Rodman andamp; Renshaw Inc. in NewYork. Sugar futures prices may climb further in coming monthsif, in the face of sustained higher oil prices, Brazildiverts more of its sugar crop to produce gasohol, whichwould further shrink world sugar supplies.                                                                                                          Copper                                                                                                          Relatively brisk demand from Europe and Japan, coupledwith supplies that have been reduced by labor disputes orother disruptions at mines in Chile, Peru, Zambia and NewGuinea, have pushed futures prices higher. Japanese importsof refined copper this year are expected to be 35% higherthan last year. Users' inventories are at about four weeks'consumption, compared with a longer-term average of five tosix weeks, says Frederick Demler, a futures analyst withPaineWebber Inc. in New York.   Nevertheless, world copper consumption is expected to risejust 1% this year as economic growth in most Westerncountries continues to slow. And if oil prices remain atcurrent levels a year from now, copper consumption in 1991could be flat with this year or down by about 1%, Mr. Demlersays.   Aluminum                                                                                                          Futures prices are higher, mainly because of concern aboutpossible production disruptions at four aluminum smelters inthe Mideast, two in the United Arab Emirates and one each inIran and Bahrain. The four smelters collectively account forabout 3% of world aluminum production, Mr. Demler says.   But demand for aluminum is declining in step with slowingeconomic growth around the world. Consumption is expected tobe up about 1% this year from last, but that pales beside the5% gain seen in 1989. Sustained higher oil prices would belikely to reduce demand from several industries that aremajor consumers, including the automobile, construction andaircraft industries. Beverage container makers are also bigusers of aluminum, but higher oil prices won't put much of adent in their consumption, Mr. Demler says.                                                                                                          Silver                                                                                                          Futures prices have ridden gold's coattails to higherlevels in recent weeks, but the rise is almost exclusivelydue to uncertainty about the Mideast. World consumption ofsilver is expected to increase this year only 1%, comparedwith 4.5% in 1989, Mr. Demler says.   In any case, the rally in silver futures prices startedfrom such depressed levels that it isn't likely to provide aninflationary &quot;kick&quot; to the economy. A few months ago, silverfutures traded at less than $5 an ounce, or close to the costof production for several major producers.   In commodity market activity yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil prices ended slightly higher in anothervolatile session dominated by news and speculation from theMiddle East. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude forSeptember delivery ended at $26.46 a barrel, up four cents.The contract traded as high as $26.75 and as low as $25.60.Late in the afternoon, prices fell after the Dow JonesInternational Petroleum Report said Saudi Arabia was workingon a formula to allow 11 OPEC members to produce the group'sself-imposed quota of 22.5 million barrels a day. Such a planwould restore almost all of what the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries was producing before Iraqinvaded Kuwait, resulting in a world-wide embargo against oilfrom those two countries.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Late profit-taking in gold erased earlygains triggered by a tough speech on the Middle East byPresident Bush. Gold for December deliver ended with a lossof $2.70 an ounce at $411.30 after trading as high as$414.40. Mr. Bush said the U.S. must make sure that the tradeand oil embargo imposed on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwaitremains tight. Analysts said gold producers have beenaggressive sellers in recent days. One analyst said theproducers &quot;may have sold more recently than they've sold in12 months.&quot; But the market was volatile, with traders warilywatching the arrival of Jordan's King Hussein in the U.S. fora meeting with Mr. Bush. &quot;Many traders sold contracts becausethey don't want to be caught by any surprises that maydevelop from the meeting,&quot; one analyst said. In the cashmarket, the bullion price dipped as far as $398 an ounce butwas able to recover to above $400 and stay there. Silver,meanwhile, suffered a sharp break after two days of strongadvances, reacting to similar moves in gold. &quot;Anytime goldshows signs of easing, there is a tendency among traders toquickly liquidate their long {buying} positions in silverbecause the supply of the metal is adequate,&quot; one analystsaid. Silver is &quot;a purely speculative market that's nottrading on supply-demand fundamentals,&quot; he said. The Decembercontract settled 13.1 cents lower at $5.2010 an ounce.                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices fluctuated ina 12-cent range before closing slightly higher. Pricesplunged in early trading on reports, which turned out to beerroneous, that Brazil was providing much more credit thanexpected to farmers. That led futures traders to predict thatBrazil would produce more soybeans for export, therebyboosting world supplies and lowering cash and futures marketprices. Later, analysts learned that the credit was for $4.2billion, which was in line with expectations. Futures priceswere also whipsawed by reports, later apparently contradictedby the Agriculture Department, that export credits for thepurchase of vegetable oils would be reduced. Soybeans forNovember delivery gained 1.25 cents a bushel to close at$6.27.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices were mixed. The October contractplunged its limit of two cents a pound for the second day ina row, ending at 70.85 cents, but later months showed slightgains. The selling in the October contract kept pressure onother months and limited their gains, said Thomas Mueller, aMerrill Lynch analyst. Mr. Mueller said that until recentlythere was strong buying of the October contract, as tradersbelieved that commitments to industrial users wouldn't be metbecause of weather problems in the Rio Grande Valleycotton-growing areas in Texas. But lately, the crop in theMississippi Delta has made excellent progress and seemslikely to make up for any shortages from Texas, according toMr. Mueller. He also said fears of a recession, which couldsharply reduce industrial demand for cotton, have promptedtraders to sell contracts.</TEXT></DOC>
