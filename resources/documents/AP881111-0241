STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 45 years after Russian tanksrolled through East Prussia, one of West Germany's leadingjournalists has produced a haunting memoir of an aristocratic andtradition-bound world shattered by war.   At the heart of Countess Marion Doenhoff's best seller,``Childhood in East Prussia,'' is the chronicle of a proud EastPrussian family, which prospered there from the Middle Ages until1945. It also details the family's loss to the German war machineand the price it paid for resistance to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.   Doenhoff, who will be 79 on Dec. 2, is co-publisher of therespected weekly newspaper Die Zeit. She shares the position withformer West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.   One of West Germany's most respected journalists and politicalcommentators, she has been a firm advocate of improved relationswith eastern Europe and has worked for reconciliation with thevictims of Nazi aggression.   Doenhoff's book comes 26 years after she detailed the family'sdramatic flight from the advancing Soviet army in a best-sellingbook titled ``Forgotten Names.''   East Prussia, once the home of vast and imposing noble estatesand the German military aristocracy, was divided into parcels afterWorld War II and ceded to Poland and the Soviet Union. It borderedthe Baltic on the north and Poland and Lithuania in the south andeast.   ``Childhood in East Prussia'' is filled with memories of theregion's rustic landscape and the stern, but unostentatious habitsof Doenhoff's family, one of the region's oldest and a member of theKaiser's court in Berlin.   She also describes distinguished visitors to the Doenhofffamily's Friedrichstein estate, located in the sprawling timber-richregion near the city of Koenigsberg, now Kaliningrad in the SovietUnion.   Referring to a visit in 1916 by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburgto the family estate when she was a little girl, Doenhoff recallsthat she was disappointed by the legendary officer's appearance:``He was tall and heavy and walked with a stiff gait. ... he did notlook like the godly hero I had imagined him to be.''   As a teen-ager, she recalls exploring the family mansion's attic,where she discovered the dusty records and long-forgottenmemorabilia of generations of Doenhoffs _ discoveries she says gaveher a sense of ``how far back my direct and formative paststretches.''   She also recounts the tragic fate of many of her relatives andfriends and her own brushes with death.   Writing of preparations by East Prussian aristocrats who joinedtogether to plot the ill-fated July 20, 1944, assassination attemptagainst Hitler, Doenhoff says: ``We were among one of the circles ofthose sworn against Hitler. I was involved in some (local)preparations, (my cousin) Heini Lehndorff with actions to carry itout.''   Lehndorff, who was to help assuming command of the Nazi garrisonin Koenigsberg, was later executed in Berlin along with hundreds ofother plotters and their sympathizers. A prominent local officialwhom she had won over to the side of the conspirators was alsokilled.   ``I anguished for a long time over why he had been killed and Iwas only questioned by the Gestapo,'' Doenhoff writes.   Later, she learned that the man's name was on a captured list ofthose who were to take over local positions of power after Hitler'sassassination.   Doenhoff writes that Hitler's war also took a terrible toll onthe sons of East Prussia's aristocracy, many of whom fell in theSoviet Union.   Thousands of civilians were also killed as Russian troopsadvanced.   The Doenhoff estate, built in the 18th century, was burned to theground in 1945 by Russian soldiers, Doenhoff says. Three of hernephews were killed in battle in Russia, as was a brother.   The coming war and the region's ultimate destruction and loss,was often the subject of grim humor among the family, as theyrenovated buildings and modernized the estate's agriculturalproduction.   ``We used to say, `The Russians will be pleased with theimprovements,''' Doenhoff writes. ``Long before 1939 we sensed thatthis insane war would come and the Russians would be the inheritorsof our labors.''   Extensive restoration efforts on the estate were completed justbefore it was destroyed.   It took decades for Doenhoff to finally accept that her homelandwas lost forever. ``For years I hoped that a miracle would happen,although my political studies had proved that there could be nomiracles in this area.''   The realities of post-war politics and the importance ofimproving relations with eastern Europe forced her to accept itsirrevocable loss.   ``If we wanted normalization, we needed clarity over the finalborders,'' Doenhoff said.   The parcels ceded to the Soviet Union and Poland after the warwere made permanent in treaties ratified between 1970 and 1972 aspart of efforts by the West German government to pursue an activerapproachment, or ``Ostpolitik,'' with the Soviet bloc.   Despite recognition of the political necessities regarding EastPrussia, Doenhoff says the emotional legacy remains.   ``Even today, after living happily in Hamburg for decades, Ianswer `East Prussia' instinctively and without thinking when askedwhere my home is. I miss the landscape ... of this lost land.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thurs AMs, Nov. 17</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
