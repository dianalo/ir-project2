The bulk of this year's quota would be filled by10,000 &quot;operatives,&quot; or low-skilled workers for manufacturingjobs, while the balance would be divided between 2,700semi-skilled workers and 2,000 manual laborers.</LP><TEXT>   Government planners argue that the territory is sufferingfrom a labor shortage and that the importation of foreignworkers is essential if Hong Kong is to maintain itscompetitive edge in the world economy. Labor leaders say thecolony's work force can meet current job needs and that thesharp rise in foreign labor proposed by the government ispartly aimed at undercutting local workers' wages andbenefits.   Meanwhile, some suspect that the government may be tryingto work both sides of the fence by imposing added costs onemployers seeking to hire foreign workers and so encouragingthe employers to try harder to hire locally. One analyst hassuggested establishing a more liberal immigration policy as aless costly and less bureaucratic alternative to thegovernment's plan.   While labor and government hurl claims and statistics ateach other, analysts note that even if labor isn't in shortsupply at present, a shortage is almost unavoidable in thenext few years and could become acute. The analysts point toan expected surge in demand for construction workers for hugeairport and seaport projects scheduled to begin in a coupleof years and to demographic trends that are likely to depleteportions of the work force needed for manual jobs andmanufacturing.   &quot;Our population is aging, and our economy is growing,&quot;says Richard Wong, director of the Hong Kong Center forEconomic Research, a privately funded research group. Otheranalysts note that more young people are choosing theservices sector over the labor end of the work force. &quot;Thelabor shortage is not a cyclical phenomenon. It's a long-termtrend,&quot; Mr. Wong says.   K.Y. Yeung, secretary of the Education and ManpowerDepartment, says the government holds with that long-termview. He says that since 1985, job vacancies have tripled,with 102,000 reported last year.   Union leaders, while conceding that the government mayeventually need to import labor, decry the decision to do sonow. &quot;The government's timing couldn't be worse,&quot; says LeeCheuk Yan, a spokesman for the recently formed ActionCommittee Against the Import of Labor. &quot;Investment incentivehas declined, and the economic situation is in a low-growthstage.&quot;   Labor leaders note that last year's 3,000-worker quota,which eventually brought in 2,700 foreign manual laborers,came when economic forecasts for the colony were rosier thanthey are today. Private economists forecast a rise inunemployment this year to 1.7% from 1.3% in 1989. (Governmentfigures for the March-May period put unemployment at 1.6%,compared with 1.5% for the same period last year.) Laborleaders also point out that the number of reported jobvacancies has declined in recent months, according togovernment figures.   Especially troublesome to labor leaders and unionadvocates is the sharp jump in the government's proposedquota for foreign workers this year. &quot;For the government toexpand to 14,700 this year from just 3,000 last year seemsunreasonable,&quot; says Y.C. Tam, Legislative Council member andvice chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions.&quot;We are worried that once the importation begins, older andunskilled workers will be affected. And how many workers willthe government import next year?&quot;   &quot;We are well aware of the labor sector's views,&quot; saysStanley Wong, principal assistant secretary in the Educationand Manpower Department. &quot;But the fact remains: We sufferfrom a labor shortage, and this is a constraint on HongKong's ability to grow.&quot;   Advocates of imported labor also point to the recent spateof illegal immigrants found working on local constructionsites as evidence of the continuing labor shortage. Unionadvocates argue that the immigrants' willingness to work forlower pay means they are stealing jobs from local workersrather than filling a need.   In the first half of this year, 13,300 illegal workerswere arrested, twice the number for the same period lastyear, according to the government. Increased unemployment insouthern China and news of Hong Kong's huge infrastructuralplans have contributed to the influx of illegal immigrants,says Ian Strachan, deputy secretary for security. Mr.Strachan concedes that jailing illegal workers hasn't been aneffective deterrent and that changes in laws to penalizetheir employers are under consideration.   However that issue is resolved, analysts say the flood ofillegal workers at least serves as a reminder that, by manyprojections, the construction industry's current work forceof nearly 70,000 can't meet future requirements. During the1990s, the government estimates that more than 20,000additional workers will be needed just to build theterritory's 127 billion Hong Kong dollar (US$16.36 billion)airport and port facilities. In addition, the governmentplans to construct 527,000 public-housing units by 2001.   Anthony Chan, an economist at the consulting andpublishing firm Business International, forecasts thatbuilding and construction growth will increase by an averageof 2.9% a year in the first half of this decade, comparedwith an average of 0.7% a year over the past five years.   Besides disputing the government's claim of a laborshortage and questioning the timing of the importation plan,labor leaders argue that the proposal aims to undermine localgains in wages and benefits. &quot;The labor-importation scheme isa political decision, not an economic decision, based on thebusiness sector's demand for cheap labor,&quot; says Mr. Lee ofthe Action Committee Against the Import of Labor.</TEXT></DOC>
