The cost ofenergy generated at bus bar as a function of operating hours and screeningcurves with reference to combined cycle plants has also been presented.Generation reliability benefits expected upon introduction of combinedcycle plants have been discussed. It has further been shown that lowerforced outage rate (FOR) and higher thermal efficiency of combined cycleplants provide distinct technoeconomic advantages over conventional steamcycle plants. 2 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
