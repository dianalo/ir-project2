The drive comes as U.S. oil industry executives arethreatening to abandon domestic oil exploration in favor ofoverseas prospects, largely as a result of congressionalopposition to the bill, which included a provision fordrilling in the wildlife refuge. That tiny piece of Alaskacontaining 36 geological structures, any of which could be abig oil field, is considered the hottest oil explorationprospect in North America.</LP><TEXT>   Oil industry executives attending the American PetroleumInstitute's annual meeting in Houston were particularlybitter about being barred from drilling in the wildliferefuge. &quot;It's a travesty that the Senate won't even discussthe bill,&quot; Kenneth Derr, chairman of Chevron Corp., said inan interview. Mr. Derr went on to echo a theme that has beenspreading throughout this unhappy meeting: that the U.S. oilindustry will continue to move more of its business overseas,where it is more welcome. &quot;It's pretty simple,&quot; Mr. Derrsaid. &quot;The {U.S.} areas that might have sizable reserves, wecan't drill.&quot;   Said Allen Murray, chairman of Mobil Corp.: &quot;The American{oil} business isn't abandoning the U.S., we're being thrownout.&quot; He added, &quot;While there are prospects in the U.S., theyare on federal lands and we can't get to them.&quot; Mr. Murrayurged Washington to open up the wildlife refuge and offshoreareas where drilling is also prohibited.   But W. Henson Moore, deputy energy secretary and a formersenator from Louisiana, recently expressed confidence thatthe administration would get an energy bill passed. &quot;We've byno means given up,&quot; he said.   The bill, encompassing a national energy strategy, waswritten by Sens. Bennett Johnston and Malcolm Wallop monthsago. It was expected to be introduced onto the Senate floorfor debate several weeks ago. But a last-minute groundswellof opposition, primarily against drilling in the wildliferefuge, and the threat of a filibuster kept the bill fromproceeding.   Indeed, President George Bush and Energy Secretary Watkinshave gotten personally involved in the lobbying effort,holding meetings with the various senators who voted in favorof a filibuster and against the bill. Thursday, for instance,the president and secretary invited a small gathering ofsenators to the White House in an effort to change their voteto support the legislation.   Among them were Sens. Charles Grass, Connie Mack, JamesJefford and Christopher Bond. Topics discussed includeddrilling in the refuge and the required use of alternativefuels. A representative for Sen. Jefford said President Bushtried to persuade the senator to change his opposition todrilling in the refuge.   An exasperated C.J. Silas, chairman of Phillips PetroleumCo. and the newly elected chairman of the American PetroleumInstitute said, &quot;We need the president to press.&quot;   Sen. Wallop, speaking at the Houston meeting, said hewould &quot;do everything he could to make it {the bill} happen.&quot;   The senator and other supporters of the bill are pushingto hold a second cloture vote, which would put an end to thefilibuster threat, before next week's Thanksgiving holiday.That would allow the bill to be debated early next year whencongress reconvenes. During the last go-round, they were only10 votes short of defeating the filibuster. It's unclear howmany votes they may have turned around to date as a result oftheir lobbying effort.   ---   James Tanner contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
