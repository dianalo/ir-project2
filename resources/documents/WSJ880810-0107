Otherwise why would people keep trying to improve on it?    Complaints about International Business Machines Corp. keyboards and their clones have been rife for years, and alternatives abound. Some designers move the keys, others change the feel.    But to many inventors, this is mere tinkering. Tony Hodges of Palo Alto, Calif., for one, contends that typing on a flat keyboard twists the hands, wrists, arms and shoulders into unnatural positions, causing strain and pain. His solution: a keyboard that can fold, something like an open book placed face down. The Tony, as Mr. Hodges calls his creation, has gotten good reviews in the trade press, but the inventor concedes that manufacturers aren't beating a path to his door.    Even more revolutionary is Datahand, designed by Industrial Innovations Inc. of Scottsdale, Ariz. Datahand splits the keyboard in two, and each unit contains a mouse. A typist's fingers rest in indentations; moving a finger within an indentation &quot;types&quot; a character. For example, pressing the right index finger down types a J, as usual. Pressure toward the top of the indentation types a U, pressure to the left types an H, pressure right types a quotation mark, and pressure toward the typist types an M.    Dale J. Retter, president of Industrial Innovations, says this method is faster, more accurate and more comfortable than ordinary data entry. He says he is &quot;in discussion with two major keyboard manufacturers&quot; that he declines to name.    Space-Age Material   Arrives in the Office   ONE THING the junior partner didn't want was an office that had the heavy, leather-bound look of a typical law firm.    But there was plenty he did want. The lawyer asked Michael Pinkus, of Pinkus Design, New York, to design a desk with a built-in compact-disk player, FM receiver, central electronic control panel and a hydraulic support arm for the computer keyboard.    But as it turned out, the most unusual feature is the material Mr. Pinkus chose for the desk top, a half-inch thick, composite slab made of carbon fiber over an aluminum honeycomb core. Mr. Pinkus says he encountered the material several years ago while designing racing cars in Italy. He chose it because it looks &quot;elegant and authoritative&quot; and because its thinness allowed him to build a double-decker desk. Computer equipment goes on the bottom, leaving the top uncluttered.    Mr. Pinkus says he expects composite materials &quot;to bust out into the furniture field with an impact like that of plywood.&quot;    Package Designers Mull   Electronic Shopping   IF SHOPPING for groceries via videotex becomes popular, how would packaging change?    Electronic grocery shopping is already being tested in part of the country, allowing shoppers to choose products from a list on the video screen for delivery to their homes. Charles Biondo, a New York package designer, predicts that this will be commonplace in 10 years or so and that shoppers will see packages on their screens. But he says packages will have to be &quot;simpler and more direct, with plain, flat colors.&quot;    Jerry Kathman, a partner in Libby Perszyx Kathman, Cincinnati, says the prospect concerns him, mainly because it's too early to know how package design would be affected. &quot;I doubt that packaging would become more generic,&quot; he says. &quot;Packaging has other functions besides competing on the shelf. When you get a product home, the package reinforces brand awareness and helps reassure the customer that he's made the right choice.&quot;    To Richard Gerstman, managing partner of Gerstman andamp; Meyers Inc., New York, designing packages for video shopping could actually be liberating because much of the fine print now on packages would be too small to see -- and would be scrapped. &quot;The packaging would be more like advertising,&quot; he says. &quot;Instead of an abundance of information, it could use photography to play up the product's visual appeal.&quot;    Odds and Ends   CONFERENCE TABLES for minimum-budget offices are designed and produced for $100 by That, a San Francisco design office. Anthony Guido, a principal, says the tables &quot;are made from rude materials, like plasterboard and metal studs and are extremely cost effective. But we also like to add some value by including leather, wood trim or maybe even semiprecious stones.&quot; . . . Changing a flat tire can be avoided with a European device being marketed in this country for the first time by Quickwheel Inc., of Greenwich, Conn. The unit resembles a small ramp on wheels. After the disabled tire is driven on the ramp and clamped to it, the car can be driven at speeds up to 45 miles per hour to a repair shop, according to the company. </TEXT></DOC>
