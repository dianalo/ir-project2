You hate to kick a guy when he's down. But something made me change my mind. I read his book.    Malicious, backbiting, shallow and presumptuous, &quot;Speaking Out: The Reagan Presidency From Inside the White House&quot; (with Robert Pack, Scribner's, $19.95) has an unkind word for nearly everyone. This is Alice Roosevelt Longworth without the wit.    Mr. Speakes, whose command of substantive issues seems to have been acquired during a stint as editor of a smalltown newspaper, doesn't hesitate to explain where President Reagan went wrong in choosing his cabinet secretaries. Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who has held three cabinet posts under three presidents and earned respect for his integrity, intelligence and patriotism, is dismissed as &quot;a hardliner, a small man, a whiny type of guy. With a green eyeshade, he would have looked just like an accountant instead of the head of our largest governmental department.&quot; Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick was, &quot;cantankerous, ideological, and difficult to work with.&quot;    You get an inkling that Mr. Speakes took a grandiose view of his mouthpiece role when, in the opening chapter, the former press secretary takes personal credit for the resignation of Secretary of State Alexander Haig. Mr. Haig, it has been endlessly repeated, felt propelled to rush to the press room on the day President Reagan was shot after watching Mr. Speakes flail wildly attempting to answer questions. Mr. Speakes cites Mr. Haig's &quot;I am in control here&quot; remark as the seed of his downfall. Instead of honestly acknowledging that the pressures of the day and his own inexperience led him to mishandle press inquiries, Mr. Speakes recalls Mr. Haig's resignation with pleasure and his own role as something of a dragon slayer. &quot;I could inadvertently change history,&quot; he crowed, &quot;as I did when I set in motion the events that would bring an early end to the political career of someone as formidable as Al Haig.&quot;    Mr. Speakes recently sulked to an interviewer that he wished people would stop rushing to the index of his book for the savage personal descriptions and the confessions of quote manufacturing, and just read it through instead. He ought to think again.    If people actually read this book thoroughly they'll only discover that Mr. Speakes came up with not just one or two indiscretions against his former employer, but 313 pages of gossip and slander. Some of it is so gratuitously nasty that one wonders how it got past the editors at Scribner's.    Describing the hospital-room scene on the day of the assassination attempt, where doctors and technicians were racing to save the life of the stricken leader of the free world, Mr. Speakes volunteers that though President Reagan was a robust 70-year-old, &quot;he had the body of an older man, with a bit of flab and withered muscles that are dead giveaways that the body is not quite what it used to be.&quot; This is beneath bad taste, down into the realm of cruelty.    Of such dramatic moments as the assassination attempt, the Libya raid, the Achille Lauro hijacking, and the Grenada invasion is this chronicle made. But Mr. Speakes provides no new information or insights about these episodes. And he skips along haphazardly from one to another, the crises seemingly selected less to shed light on the Reagan presidency than to shed glory upon Larry Speakes.    The author admits he was kept in the dark about Grenada. But with that exception, every triumph of the Reagan era comes out sounding like a Speakes production.    Perhaps in an attempt to get even for having been cut out of the loop on the Grenada operation, Mr. Speakes undermines the president's public explanation of the invasion and thereby his credibility, denying that the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States had issued an urgent request for help. &quot;You might say we RSVP'ed in advance,&quot; reveals Mr. Speakes with a poke in the ribs and a wink.    More interesting than what Larry Speakes did in the White House is how he got there. Like so many others who called themselves the &quot;pragmatists&quot; of the Reagan presidency, Mr. Speakes had little understanding of or sympathy with the president's philosophy. He was motivated, he admits, by a desire to work in the White House -- any White House. In 1980, he interviewed with George Bush, Jack Kemp and Mr. Haig, searching for the winning horse. He never worked for the Reagan campaign and was hired after the election through Republican contacts.    It remains a mystery how a man who had devoted his life to public relations could have committed a blunder of this magnitude. Everyone makes mistakes. The sad part for Mr. Speakes is that if his book is widely read, there will be no one to commiserate with him.    ---   Ms. Charen, who worked in the Reagan White House from 1984-1986, is a syndicated columnist. </TEXT></DOC>
