He appealed to South Africans of all races to help build a nation``free of domination and oppression.   ``We accept that time is of the essence and we are committed tovisible, evolutionary progress,'' de Klerk said in his inauguralspeech.   He has vowed to eliminate discrimination and allow blacks, whocurrently cannot vote, participation in government under a five-yearplan.   But he did not specify any apartheid laws he would repeal. Nordid he say how he would implement his goal of providing limitedpolitical rights to the 28-million black majority while maintainingthe political domination of the country's 5 million whites.   De Klerk, 53, took the oath of office as reports spread that hisgovernment will free jailed black nationalist leader Nelson Mandelaearly next year. Newspapers quoted official sources as saying therelease will be part of a package of reforms to draw blacks intoconstitutional talks.   ``The negotiation process will, from the start, receive incisiveattention,'' de Klerk said in the speech following his swearing-inceremony.   His conciliatory words, affable style, and new policy of allowingpeaceful protests against the government have generated optimismamong foreign observers and many South Africans. But de Klerkrejects the basic demand of most black leaders: majority rule.   The Rev. Allan Boesak, a leading anti-apartheid activist andpresident of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, said he willgive de Klerk six months to prove that blacks' skepticism isunfounded.   A tear rolled down de Klerk's cheek at a Dutch Reformed Churchwhen the Rev. P.W. Bingle, a family friend preaching at theswearing-in, urged the new president to press forward without fear.   Chief Justice Michael Corbett handed de Klerk a paper from whichhe read the oath of office in Afrikaans and English before about1,500 people. No foreign heads of state were present, an indicationof South Africa's international isolation.   Motorcyle policemen, a cavalry unit and white-jacketedpresidential guards with drawn swords lined the route of de Klerk'smotorcade to an amphitheater at Union Buildings, the seat of theexecutive branch of government, on a ridge overlooking Pretoria.   Black and white choirs sang hymns and African songs, three Impalaair force jets flew over trailing smoke in the blue, white andorange colors of the South African flag, and several people amongthe crowd of 3,500 screamed when a 21-gun salute began announcing deKlerk's arrival.   In his 20-minute inaugural speech, de Klerk said his goal is ``aSouth Africa free of domination or oppression in whatever form.''   ``We hope that he will ... demonstrate that he is serious abouthis vision for a new South Africa, because that is the vision wewant,'' Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prizewinner, said in Windhoek, Namibia.   De Klerk said his government will move to eliminatediscriminatory laws, give ``urgent attention'' to adopting a bill ofrights, ``gradually move away'' from the 3-year-old state ofemergency, and release security prisoners.   De Klerk did not mention Mandela by name, but said politicalprisoners would be freed if public order was not threatened andtheir release would enhance peace prospects.   Many South Africans consider Mandela their top leader and hisfreedom has been demanded as a condition for negotiations. Mandelawas sentenced to life imprisonment in 1962 for allegedly plotting tooverthrow the white government.   As Wednesday's ceremony began, a group of human rights lawyers inPretoria announced de Klerk had commuted the death sentences ofseven convicted murderers, including a black activist convicted ofburning to death of a black constable during nationwideanti-government unrest that prompted former President P.W. Botha toimpose the national emergency.   De Klerk became acting president Aug. 15, a day after the Cabinetforced Botha to resign after 11 years in power.   De Klerk's National Party retained power after national electionson Sept. 6 but suffered huge losses in Parliament to leftist andrightist factions.   De Klerk practiced law before entering Parliament in 1973. From1978, he held a series of Cabinet posts, and in 1982 took on thepowerful job of National Party leader in Transvaal, South Africa'smost populous and wealthy province.   De Klerk and his wife, Marike, have three children.</TEXT></DOC>
