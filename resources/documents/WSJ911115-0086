The Ministry of Rituals arranged for foreign dignitariesto kowtow and deliver gifts to China's last emperors, thoseof the Ching Dynasty. The modern-day equivalent is China'stelevision news, which often depicts the nation's Communistleaders perched in overstuffed chairs granting formalaudiences to foreign diplomats, politicians and businessexecutives.                                                                                                          Mr. Baker's presence will be a gift for China's propagandamachine to use in reaffirming that all is well with today'soccupiers of the remnants of the Dragon Throne. It's unclearwhat Mr. Baker will get in return. But it's certain that hehad little choice but to come.   Two years and five months after troops slaughtereddemonstrators here and President Bush suspended high-levelcontacts with China, U.S. policy made in the heat of themoment is being replaced by pragmatic diplomacy. Put simply:The world has changed and China has won the waiting game.   Unpopular as they may be in China and abroad for the June4, 1989, bloodshed and continued political repression,Premier Li Peng, President Yang Shangkun and party chiefJiang Zemin have not only survived but solidified their holdon power.   With the collapse of communism elsewhere knockinggeopolitical balances out of kilter, and the Gulf Warprecipitating delicate Middle East peace efforts, U.S.officials say it's more important to deal with China'sleaders than to continue avoiding them.   China has cooperated with the U.S. in United NationsSecurity Council decisions involving the Gulf War and inarranging a peace agreement for Cambodia. U.S. officials alsobelieve that China's assistance could be the key topersuading North Korea to abandon its apparent efforts toacquire nuclear weapons capability.   Additionally, U.S. avoidance of high-level contacts withChina has been undermined by the flood of other foreigndignitaries pouring into Beijing. In recent months, China'sleaders have entertained, among others, the prime ministersof Japan, Italy and Britain, senior officials from Iran,Egypt, Germany, Canada, North Korea and Vietnam -- evenenvoys from Taiwan. This week, two former U.S. secretaries ofstate, Alexander Haig and George Shultz, visited here and metwith senior leaders, ostensibly as representatives of U.S.corporations.   Although Mr. Baker is joining the parade, analysts say,U.S.-China relations are poised to plummet if China doesn'trespond by making good on recent promises. &quot;This is atroubled relationship that could get worse, and that is amajor reason why Baker is going to China,&quot; says MichelOksenberg, a China scholar at the University of Michigan. &quot;Itis by no means clear that the top leaders in China, despiteall the efforts to communicate this to them, understandthat.&quot;   U.S. officials believe that China has deliberately draggedits feet on trade and weapons nonproliferation issues topressure the U.S. to restore high-level contacts. Unless Mr.Baker's visit is followed by clear movement on the Chineseside, pressure from Congress will force President Bush toapply commercial sanctions, the officials say.   China has privately promised the U.S. and publiclypromised Japan that it would sign the NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty, and implied that it would joinagreements to limit the spread of missile technology. But inOctober, the standing committee of the National People'sCongress shelved for further study the proposal to sign thenonproliferation treaty. Meanwhile, U.S. officials accuseChina of exporting nuclear-weapons technology to Iran andAlgeria while peddling long-range missiles to Pakistan andSyria.   Bilateral trade issues present an immediate flashpoint. OnNov. 26, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills is scheduledto decide whether China offers sufficient protection forintellectual property. If not, she must by law enactretaliatory tariffs against Chinese imports. The U.S.considers Chinese patent and copyright laws inadequate, andChina has made no moves to amend them.   Analysts say that with Congress bashing the White Housefor its policy of engagement with China and for continuing&quot;most favored nation&quot; trade status, Mr. Bush must take a hardline on commercial disputes with China. One of Mr. Baker'sapparent objectives this weekend is to warn Beijing that Mr.Bush has run out of patience. Whether China made any concretepromises to secure Mr. Baker's trip is uncertain.   Looming large over any commercial quarrels are differencesover human rights. Mr. Baker set the tone for his trip bycalling China's leadership &quot;an anachronistic regime&quot; andindicating that a major reason for dialogue is to put theU.S. in position to have influence when inevitable politicalchange comes to China.   Beijing, despite its polite exterior, has meanwhilecirculated documents to Communist Party members that depictthe U.S. as a dangerous enemy determined to overthrow China'ssocialist system.   Still, because China is a nuclear power, a permanentmember of the U.N. Security Council, home to 22% of theworld's people and a key player in a rapidly changing Asia,the U.S. needs close ties. China, in turn, needs U.S. marketsand investment to keep its economy moving fast enough tostave off unrest. The U.S. purchases a third of China'sexports.
