Baker III saidtoday there are indications the Soviet Union may be considering areferendum in Lithuania as a way of shaping the future of theindependence-minded Baltic republic.   But Baker also registered ``a degree of concern'' about theLithuanian situation as he prepared to begin three days of talkswith Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.   Baker is hoping Shevardnadze's visit will produce a plan for apeaceful settlement in Lithuania as well as a date for the nextsuperpower summit meeting and progress on U.S.-Soviet arms controlaccords.   At the State Department, Baker said Lithuania ``will be at thevery top of the issues we will be discussing.'' Talking toreporters after a meeting with West German Foreign MinisterHans-Dietrich Genscher, he said ``we are anxious to see thesedevelopments proceed peacefully and be resolved through dialogue.''   Baker was buoyed by the meeting Alexandr N. Yakolev, a closeadviser to Gorbachev, held in Moscow on Tuesday with a delegationof officials from Lithuania.   ``There would appear, at least, to be the beginnings of such adialogue,'' Baker said. ``... We are encouraged as well that we seereferences coming from both sides to the concept of the possibilityof some sort of a referendum approach.''   A Soviet foreign ministry official, appearing on ABC-TV's ``GoodMorning America,'' reaffirmed the Kremlin's pledge to deal with thesecessionists in a peaceful way.   ``Mr. Shevardnadze will certainly describe our attitude andreiterate our intention to work toward resolution of the situationthrough dialogue and in a peaceful manner,'' said Vitaly Churkin,an adviser to the foreign minister.   Last Thursday, Lithuanian leaders informed the Kremlin they wereready to discuss the issue of a referendum on secession ifGorbachev agreed to talk with them. The Soviet leader, havingdemanded the nullification of a March 11 declaration ofindependence, did not respond immediately.   But the meeting with Yakolev indicated the two sides may betrying to find a way out of the impasse created by the declarationand Gorbachev's refusal to accept it. Baker's remarks todaysuggested he shared in that judgment.   Also on the agenda is the war in Angola between the Soviet-armedgovernment and U.S.-aided rebels. Baker is trying for a cease-firebut insists on a commitment from the Luanda government that it willshare power with the UNITA guerrillas led by Jonas Savimbi.   Before the opening round beginning late this afternoon, U.S.officials had no word on whether Shevardnadze brought a reply fromGorbachev to Bush's letter last week reiterating U.S. hopes for apeaceful settlement in Lithuania.   But the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidthey hoped Gorbachev and Shevardnadze would spell out how theSoviets plan to come to grips with the secessionist movement in theBaltic republic.   Arriving here Tuesday, Shevardnadze likened events in Lithuaniato an earthquake, but he also pledged to engage in ``honestdialogue'' with the independence movement.   While the foreign minister's remarks had a conciliatory ring, healso emphasized the importance the Kremlin attaches to the SovietConstitution and Soviet laws.   ``You must understand the importance of that question for theSoviet Union and the Soviet people,`` Shevardnadze said.   Bush and Baker have no intention of scrapping plans for thesummit over Lithuania, officials said. The selection of a precisedate in June depends on the Soviets scheduling a People's Congressin Moscow the same month.   Bush and Gorbachev hope during the summit to sign an accord tolimit their long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines.However, claims that the overall cutback would amount to 50 percentcame under challenge on Tuesday.   A senior administration official, declining to be identified,told The Associated Press the United States would wind up with onlyslightly fewer deployed warheads than in the current arsenals. Whenwarheads kept in storage are taken into account, he said, the U.S.total actually would exceed the current level.   The official said that from the U.S. standpoint the principalvirtue of the treaty would be to force a reduction in long-rangeSoviet SS-18 missiles.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said thetreaty would cut the SS-18 force in half and also reduce the totalof deployed Soviet missiles by about half.   ``The treaty is based on equality,'' she said, reading from astatement. ``Since Soviet force levels exceed our own in the mostdangerous and destabilizing systems, their reductions will besomewhat larger.''</TEXT></DOC>
