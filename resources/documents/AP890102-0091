(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founders Jim and Tammy Faye Bakkerreturned to the television pulpit Monday for the first time in twoyears with an appeal for ``hurting people'' to keep the faith, butno direct pleas for donations.   ``If Jim and Tammy can survive their holocaust of the last twoyears, then you can make it,'' said Bakker, who left PTL in March1987 amid a sex-and-money scandal.   ``The Jim and Tammy Show'' originated in the living room of theBakkers' borrowed home in this Charlotte suburb. They said it wassent by satellite to a half-dozen stations in California, Ohio, NewYork, Pennsylvania and Louisiana, with the couple's new ministrypaying for air time.   The hourlong telecast is scheduled Mondays through Fridays.   ``We bought time,'' said Mrs. Bakker. ``We had a certain amountof money and that's all the time we could buy, and it's not a lot ofmoney, but it got us back on the air and we are so grateful.''   In their prime at PTL, the Bakkers and their ``PTL Club'' couldbe seen on about 180 television stations.   As in their old show, the Bakkers sat on a couch. Mrs. Bakkerwore her trademark heavy eye makeup and broke into tears severaltimes, the first just two minutes into their show.   The couple made no direct appeal for funds, but gave an addressand telephone number so viewers could request prayers.   And the show's guest, former PTL songwriter Mike Murdock, gaveMrs. Bakker a card which he said he had been asked to deliver by asupporter. Mrs. Bakker said the card contained a $1,000 check.   John Bland, a volunteer at Jim and Tammy Ministries, saidMonday's show drew ``a beautiful response.''   ``A lot of people called in who said they were partners(supporters who gave $1,000 or more to PTL) and glad to see thatthey were back on TV,'' Bland said.   The Bakkers' last appearance as television evangelists was inJanuary 1987, two months before the scandal that drove them fromPTL. They had left the air because Mrs. Bakker was receivingtreatment for dependency on prescription drugs and for pneumonia,the couple said at the time.   ``Jim, I think this is probably the happiest day of my life,''Mrs. Bakker said as the show began.   Bakker told viewers that his last television appearance was tobreak ground for the Crystal Palace Church at Heritage USA, the homeof PTL.   ``I believe that was the last straw for Satan,'' Bakker said. ``Ithink the devil was mad that something so beautiful was being built.... I believe the devil said, `I have to smash Jim and TammyBakker.'''   Bakker resigned from PTL following disclosure of his 1980 sexualencounter with a church secretary, Jessica Hahn, and that she hadbeen paid for her silence.   In June 1987, the ministry sought protection from creditors inbankruptcy court, and last month a judge approved the sale of PTL'schief asset, the Heritage USA theme park at Fort Mill, S.C.   Also last month, Bakker and a top aide were indicted on chargesthey used PTL funds for private gain.   But the only mention of his legal troubles during the show camewhen Murdock noted a song he said he wrote in a lawyer's office.Murdock said he knew Bakker ``didn't know anything about lawyers.''   ``Oh no-o-o-o,'' Bakker said with a pained chuckle.   Fred Wuenschel, general manager WOCD in Amsterdam, N.Y., one ofthe stations broadcasting the program, said he would show it ``aslong as they keep paying.''   He said the station has a 30-day contract for the show, butdeclined to say how much the Bakkers are paying except to say it was``the usual rate per hour.''</TEXT></DOC>
