ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Despite some reservations, securities analystsgenerally applauded President Bush's announcement Monday of asavings and loan industry bailout plan that includes higher federalinsurance premiums for banks as well as thrifts.   ``It's something the whole system can live with,'' James Wilson,an analyst with Sutro andamp; Co. in San Francisco, said of the depositinsurance premium hike, a key part of Bush's proposal.   Under Bush's plan, the higher premiums would be used to help paythe interest on $50 billion in bonds to finance the bailout ofinsolvent thrifts.   ``It's a big dollar figure, but it's an enormous industry _ theeffect on individual depositors or homebuyers isn't going to beenough for them to notice signficantly,'' Wilson said.   Allan Bortel, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in SanFrancisco, said ``the premiums that are being increased are verysmall _ it doesn't raise much more money each year from savingsinstiutions.''   ``It doesn't seem to be onerous for the Sandamp;Ls,'' he said.   But James Marks, of SNL Securities in Hoboken, N.J., said theproposed increase could force some shaky thrifts over the edge.   ``They can't afford to pay as much as they are now,'' Marks said.``To increase them...could force thrifts that would otherwise havesurvived into insolvency.''   The analysts said banks and thrifts could be expected to pass onat least a portion of their costs to consumers, possibly in the formof lower interest rates on savings accounts or in higher service orloan charges.   But the analysts did not expect depositors to withdraw money fromSandamp;Ls because of the possibility they might ultimately pay for thehigher premiums.   ``With the rise in short-term interest rates, money market fundsare extremely attractive right now,'' Marks said. ``People arelooking at what they can get, but it has nothing to do with this.''   Analysts said people who are concerned about the safety of theirmoney will leave it in thrifts because those deposits arefederally-insured while money market funds are not, making themslightly riskier.   Bush also recommended combining the Federal Savings andamp; LoanInsurance Corp. which insures deposits at thrifts, with theinsurance fund for banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., whilekeeping each agency's funds separate.   The president proposed regulatory changes, including steps toreduce the type of risky investments that got the industry intodifficulty. He also suggested that insolvent savings and loaninstitutions be placed under the joint control of the FDIC and FSLIC.   ``You have a much larger staff they can work with at the FDIC,some of them quite experienced in real estate,'' a trouble spot formany thrifts, Sutro said.   Overall, the analysts were pleased that the government was tryingto end the thrift crisis, which has seen hundreds of Sandamp;Ls forcedinto insolvency.   But, said Wilson, ``To some degree, it's almost too little toolate.'' Most of the problems that led to thrift bailouts _ such asmismanagement or fraud at some institutions and the economicdepression in the Southwest _ have already happened, he said.   However, the plan should be ``more expeditious in solving thecurrent problems,'' Wilson said.   Shearson's Bortel called Bush's proposals a step in the rightdirection but said they did not provide enough money for thehundreds of savings institutions that still are short of funds.</TEXT></DOC>
