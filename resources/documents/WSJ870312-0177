Califano for revealing in his Feb. 10 letter to the editor that interference by the government in our lives is required by the Ten Commandments. Some may have thought that federal welfare programs, which in 50 years or so have helped reduce Americans from free citizens to slaves and mendicants, arose merely by misinterpretation of the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution. Now we learn that those programs violate at least the First Amendment's separation of church and state, and are thus illegal.    Perhaps the former secretary of health and human services would let us have his further &quot;pro-bono&quot; opinion on precisely which of the Commandments imposes an affirmative &quot;obligation in social justice,&quot; to use his phrase. There are only two affirmative Commandments: to keep the Sabbath, and to honor one's father and mother. The ones against stealing and covetousness contain no qualification permitting the use of the powers of government, originally intended to preserve our freedom and property, by officials to benefit some citizens at the involuntary expense of others, with salaries for public servants taken off the top. Apparently the penalty for violating the Constitution these days is mere public adulation, but a violation of the Commandments, as some in government may find, could be somewhat more taxing.
