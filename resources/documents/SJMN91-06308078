I alwayswondered what I would say.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CAL SETTLES SCORES WITH 52 AGAINST USCWHITE RUNS 229 YARDS FOR BEARS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;I had a lot of outrageous things that I won't talk to you guys about.&quot;;  Instead, Cal made its statement in a manner so precise that it left themajority of 70,000 fans at Memorial Stadium craving more.;   The Bears routedSouthern Cal 52-30 on Saturday, erasing years of humiliation against what usedto be the class of the Pacific 10 Conference. The 52 points were the most everscored against USC.;   Going into Saturday's game, Cal was 1-11-1 against theTrojans since 1978.;   The 10th-ranked Bears (7-1, 4-1) saved their bestperformance of the season for some of the most important people -- six bowlscouts and a regional television audience.;   After the game, representativesfrom three Jan. 1 bowls -- the Citrus, Fiesta and Sugar -- sported smilesafter talking with Cal Coach Bruce Snyder and Athletic Director Bob Bockrath.;  &quot;I do know that if this team were selected to play in a New Year's Day bowl,we would be a hell of a selection,&quot; Snyder said.;   Nov. 17 is the first daybowl invitations can be formally extended.;   The Bears began their march withRussell White's 66-yard kickoff return and didn't let up. They scored on sevenof their first eight possessions and capped the game with a backflip byreserve quarterback Perry Klein.;   &quot;They went for the jugular and got it,&quot;USC Coach Larry Smith said after his Trojans (3-5, 2-3) lost their third in arow for the first time since 1975. That also was the last time they lost toCal and Stanford in the same season.;   Cal displayed its version of Showtime.White, the Bears' marquee player, rushed for 229 yards and scored threetouchdowns, including a 72-yard jaunt.;   The Bears scorched the Trojans withtwo trick plays in the first half, including &quot;Sugarooskie,&quot; a 19-yard run byright guard Eric Mahlum.;   The other gadget play, a two-point conversion passfrom Mike Pawlawski to Chris Carpenter, was dubbed &quot;Fiesta&quot; by Mariucci.;  &quot;We'll have another play called &quot;Citrus,&quot; Mariucci joked.;   The 35-7 halftimescore reflected the ease with which the Bears reached the end zone.;   &quot;Everytime I touched the ball it was like 40 yards,&quot; said White, whose 175 yards atthe half were only 2 short of his previous career best.;   &quot;There have beenspurts where we've played well,&quot; Snyder said. &quot;For a game in question, that'sas well as we've played.&quot;;   The defense did its share by forcing twointerceptions in the first half that led to scores.;   The Bears simplyfulfilled all their wishes.;   &quot;We didn't have to harness any hate,&quot; saidPawlawski, who threw for 212 yards and three TDs. &quot;We had confidence going in,and that first quarter just assured us even more.&quot;;   White, whose uncleCharles White won a Heisman Trophy at USC in 1979, says he has despised theTrojans since they tried to pressure him into committing to USC as a highschool senior.;   &quot;I got my vendetta taken care of today when we got a win,&quot;White said.;   White left the game with nine minutes left but returned whenCal realized he had a chance to break the record for most yards gained againstUSC. White surpassed former UCLA back Gaston Green's 224-yard effort againstSouthern Cal in 1986.;   And when Mariucci, a former assistant at USC, sawthat veteran cornerback Calvin Holmes was on the bench late in the thirdquarter, &quot;we went after that little freshman (Jerald Henry) at the end.&quot;;  The result was a 33-yard TD pass from Pawlawski to Sean Dawkins that increasedCal's lead to 49-14.;   &quot;This is a lot of years of frustration that has builtup, and now we have arrived,&quot; Mariucci said. &quot;The kids deserve to play thewhole game and keep doing our thing. They deserve to win the game that big. Itshould have been worse.&quot;; USC              7  0  7  16--30; Cal             2213 14   3--52;      Cal--White 5 run (Brien kick);      So.Cal--Strother 92run (Ford kick);      Cal--White 72 run (Carpenter pass from Pawlawski);     Cal--Dawkins 11 pass from Pawlawski (Brien kick);      Cal--Brien 20 FG;     Cal--Brien 23 FG;      Cal--White 1 run (Brien kick);      So.Cal--Perry 2 run(Ford kick);      Cal--Dawkins 5 pass from Pawlawski (Brien kick);     Cal--Dawkins 33 pass from Pawlawski (Brien kick);      Cal--Brien 37 FG;     So.Cal--Strother 1 run (Conway pass from Johnson);      So.Cal--Wallace 22pass from Johnson (Crayton run);                              USC     Cal;First downs                 25      23; Rushes-yards            43-221 50-389; Passing                    244     212; Return Yards                00     48; Comp-Att-Int           19-36-2 13-25-0; Punts                  5-37.4    2-44.5; Fumbles-Lost               1-0     2-1; Penalties-Yards         11-86    16-167; Time of Possession       29:46   30:14; INDIVIDUALSTATISTICS; RUSHING; CAL         Att.
