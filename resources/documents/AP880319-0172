Their adequateimplementation has played the crucial role in the normalization ofinter-state relations and the development of all-around and stablecooperation. The two sides shall continue to adhere by theseprinciples.   The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Union ofSoviet Socialist Republics are building and advancing. Theirrelations starting from the unconditional respect ofparticularities of the paths and norms of their socialistdevelopment and different international positions.</TEXT><TEXT>   Proceeding from the conviction that no one has a monopoly overthe truth, the two sides declare that they have no pretensions ofimposing their concept of social development on anyone. The successof any path to socialism is tested through socio-political practiceand confirmed by the results of social progress.   The League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Communist Partyof the Soviet Union will strive to enrich cooperation and cultivatepermanent political dialogue for the purpose of an exhaustiveexchange of opinions and experiences about current issues ofsocialist development in the two countries, about socialism as aworld process, about global issues of the world and socialprogress, and international cooperation and strengtheningconfidence between peoples.   The two countries consider the development of socialistself-management, in keeping with the specificities of each country,to be of the highest importance. It ensures the genuine authorityof the people and the freedom of the individual and is a dependableguarantee against any administrative-bureaucratic distortion ofsocialism, against dogmatism and voluntarism.</TEXT><TEXT>   Socialism is at a crossing point, at the threshold of a fullerrealization of material and spiritual potentials, of deepeninghumanistic bases.</TEXT><TEXT>   - The policy of non-aliignment is against imperialism,colonialism and neo-colonialism, apartheid and all forms ofaggression, interference, violence, domination, hegemony anddiscrimination in political and economic relations and restrictionsof international cooperation by narrow limits of existing groupings.</TEXT><TEXT>   The decisive step in the realization of this striving is haltingthe armaments race and opening an irreversible process of nuclearand conventional disarmament for the purpose of general and fulldisarmament under effective international control.   Realistic removal of the danger of a nuclear catastrophe, whichimplies a full and general liquidation of nuclear armament,represents the highest and most urgent interest of all peoples.   This process has been opened by the treaty of the Union ofSoviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America aboutdestruction of the rockets of the medium- and long-range varietyand thus encourages hopes of mankind for a safer future.   It is indispensable and possible that, without delay, thepreparation and conclusion of an agreement on a general and fullban of nuclear arms testing be taken up, with the strictest stepsof control in this area, preventing militarization of the cosmoswhich belongs to mankind, and a ban and liquidation of all kinds ofweapons for mass destruction.</TEXT><TEXT>   The two countries attach great significance to the respect ofhuman rights and they strive for their full and consistentrealization in the whole world.   Human rights and basic freedoms are unalienable, indivisible andmutually interlocked. A particular significance of those rights andfreedoms enable man to take part in creating a condition of life,in disposing with the results of his work, and in directlyinfluencing social and political relations in his own country.</TEXT></DOC>
