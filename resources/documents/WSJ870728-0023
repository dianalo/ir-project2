Research commissioned by Clayton andamp; Dubilier Inc., a New York-based investment firm, suggests that large U.S. companies will continue to be restructured, shedding operations they can't run efficiently through sales to other concerns or through leveraged buy-outs. In a leveraged buy-out, an investor group buys a concern in a transaction financed largely by debt that is ultimately paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of assets.    Of the 250 Fortune 500 chief executives, chief financial officers and other senior financial managers surveyed in June, 23% said restructuring in their companies is &quot;very likely,&quot; and 27% thought it possible, the survey said. </TEXT></DOC>
