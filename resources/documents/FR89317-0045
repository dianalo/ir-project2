(d) Further information regarding the responsibilities and functions ofthe OIG is encompassed in Public Law 95-452, the ``Inspector General Actof 1978,'' as amended and 32 CFR Part 373. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 284.4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">OIG ``Records'' Defined. </ITAG>(a) The products of data compilation, regardless of physical form or characteristics,made or received by any element  of the OIG in connection with the transactionof public business and preserved by the OIG as evidence of the organization,policies, functions, decisions, or procedures of the OIG. Such recordsinclude current data and are not limited to permanent or historical data.(b) This definition of ``records'' does not include: (1) Objects or articles, such as structures, furniture, paintings, sculpture,three-dimensional models, vehicles and equipment and similar items, whatevertheir historical value, or value as evidence. (2) Library and museum material made, acquired, and preserved solely forreference or exhibition. (3) Commercially exploitable resources including, but not limited to, formulae,designs, drawings, map compilation manuscripts, map research material anddata or computer programs that were not created for, or are not being usedas, primary sources of information about the OIG organizations, policies,functions, decisions or procedures. This does not include the underlyingdata which is processed and produced by computer programs which may, insome instances, be stored with the programs. (4) Unaltered publications and processed documents, such as regulations,manuals, directives, instructions, maps, charts, and related materialsthat are available to the public through an established distribution systemby sale or without charge, such as documents available through the Superintendentof Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office.

(7) Information stored within a computer for which there is no existingcomputer program or printout. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 284.5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>(1) It is the policy of the OIG to promote public trustby making the maximum amount of information available to the public, withdue regard for the protection of records that may be specifically exemptedfrom release under the FOIA or prohibited by statutory or other regulatoryrequirements. (2) Records that may be withheld under the FOIA exemptions will be releasedwhen it has been determined that no governmental interest will be jeopardizedby their release and no inconsistency with other statutory or regulatoryrequirements exist. The determination of whether governmental interestswill be jeopardized by releasing the records, or other prohibitions againstrelease exist is within the sole discretion of the Initial Denial Authorities(IDAs) or Appellate Authority identified in andSection; 284.6, or other higherauthority. (3) Records may be withheld from the public only as authorized by 5 U.S.C.552, as amended, and upon the determination of the IDAs or Appellate Authoritythat the records, or portions thereof, are exempted or prohibited fromrelease. (4) Any request for OIG records that either explicitly or implicitly citesthe FOIA will be processed under the provisions set forth in this Part;or, in the event the request is from the subject of the records, underthe Privacy Act unless the record is in a system of records exempt fromrelease under that Act. (b) <T3>Availability of Records. </T3>(1) A record must exist and be in thepossession or control of the OIG at the time of the request to be consideredsubject to release under FOIA. Mere possession of a record, or identifiableportions thereof, does not assume OIG ownership and any such records orportions will be referred to the originating agency for a release determinationand/or direct response to the requester. There is no obligation to createnor compile a record to satisfy a FOIA request; however, the OIG may compilea record from available data when doing so would result in a more usefulresponse to the requester, or be less burdensome to the OIG than providingthe existing records, and the requester does not object. (2) When a request seeks records which are part of an ongoing audit, inspection,or investigation, the requester will be advised of such (subject to the``Exclusions'' under the FOIA identified in Appendix B of this Part) andasked if he/she objects to the request being held in abeyance pending completionof the respective audit, inspection, or investigation. This procedure doesnot apply to the following types of records within the above mentionedfiles:(i) Any documents clearly in the public domain, such as excerpts from nonexemptpublications or unsealed court records, will be released to the requesterso long as the release will not jeopardize or interfere with the ongoingprocess. (ii) Any documents provided by the requester will be released to him/heror his/her duly authorized representative, so long as the release willnot jeopardize or interfere with the ongoing process, is consistent withany applicable OIG Privacy Act rules and procedures; and, where the requesterhas provided information that is company proprietary/confidential, certificationthat the requester is acting as the company's representative has been receivedin accordance with the procedures outlined in andSection; 284.7(a)(4). Theserecords will be provided as an interim response to the initial request.If the requester objects to his/her request being held in abeyance, thenan appropriate release determination shall be made consistent with thestatutory provisions of the FOIA. (3) A request made by an individual for access to a record pertaining tohim/herself, hereinafter referred to as a personal record, which citesthe FOIA and/or implementing directives, regulations or instructions thereto,will be processed under the provisions of that reference. A request madeby an individual for access to his/her personal record which cites thePrivacy Act and/or implementing directives, regulations or instructionsthereto, will be processed under the provisions of that reference. A requestmade by an individual for access to his/her personal record which citesboth Acts and/or implementing directives, regulations or instructions thereto,or neither Act will be processed in accordance with both references, usingthe fee provisions of the Privacy Act and the time constraints of the FOIA.No individual will be denied access to personal information or recordsconcerning him/herself that would be releasable to him/her under eitherAct solely because he/she fails to cite either Act or cites the wrong Act,and/or implementing directives, regulations or instructions. (4) Nonexempt records released under the provisions of this Part and inaccordance with DoD Directive 5230.9,\2\<NOTE/> ``Clearance of DoD Information for Public Release'', areconsidered to be in the public domain. Exempt records released pursuantto this Part or other statutory or regulatory authority, however, may beconsidered to be in the public domain only when their release constitutesa waiver of the relevant FOIA exemption(s). When the release does not constitutesuch a waiver, such as when disclosure is made to a DoD contractor so thatthe contractor may comply with the requirements of the contract, or toa properly constituted advisory committee, or to a Congressional Committee,the released records do not lose their exempt status. While exempt recordsmay be provided to individuals in their official capacity for their officialuse, such records do not lose their exempt status and the provisions ofthis rule apply if the same individual seeks to use the records, or seeksrecords for use, in a private or personal capacity. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Copies may be obtained, if needed, from the National TechnicalPublications and Forms Center, Attn: Code 1053, 5801 Tabor Avenue, Philadelphia,PA 19120. (c) <T3>Index and (a)(2) Materials. </T3>(1) No order, opinion, statement ofpolicy, interpretation, staff manual (except as specified in Chapter II,Section 1, of DoD 5400.7-R,\3\<NOTE/> ``DoD Freedom of Information Act Program''), or instructionissued after July 4, 1967, which is not indexed and either made availableor published, may be relied upon, used, or cited as a precedent againstany member of the public unless that individual has actual and timely noticeof the contents of such materials. Such actual and timely notice may notbe after-the-fact; i.e., after the individual has suffered some adverseeffect. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Copies may be obtained, at cost, from the National TechnicalInformation Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.(2) Thus, materials considered to meet the definition of the FOIA (a)(2)requirements as described in Chapter II, Section 1, of 5400.7-R (32 CFRPart 286), will be made available for public inspection and copying uponwritten request to the address indicated in andSection; 284.7(a), unlesssuch materials have been published and are offered for sale or subscription.Upon receipt of the request, arrangements will be made at a time convenientto both the requester and the OIG, for the review and copying. If the publishingactivity is out of stock of the published, for sale material and does notintend to reprint, then the preceding procedure will apply to the publishedmaterial as well. (3) The cost of copying any (a)(2) materials will be imposed upon the individualrequesting the copy in accordance   with Chapter VI of DoD 5400.7-R. (4) The OIG has determined that it is not practical nor feasible to preparean index of the (a)(2) materials on a quarterly basis, nor to publish theannual ``Index of IG, DoD, Publications'' in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>because of the volume. This index is availableto the public at no cost and upon written request to the address indicatedin andSection; 284.7(a); however, it may be necessary to deny all or portionsof documents listed in the index that fall within one or more exemptionsof the FOIA. Material in the index has been arranged by numbering system,as well as topically. (d) <T3>Describing Records Sought. </T3>(1) A member of the public must describethe records sought with sufficient information to permit the OIG to conductan organized, nonrandom search for records based on filing arrangementsand existing retrieval systems. For example, a request for ``all recordsabout cost cutting'' would be too broad and lacking in sufficient description,but a request for ``any internal OIG guidance issued during 1987 on measuresfor cutting costs'' would provide sufficient information to identify thetype of record being sought. (2) Requests that fall into the category of ``fishing expeditions'' willnot be honored and the requester will be so advised. Guidance will alsobe provided to the requester for describing the records sought with greatersufficiency, and for resubmitting the request.(e) <T3>Promptness of Response. </T3>(1) A request for OIG records from a memberof the public will be responded to within 10 working days of the date ofits receipt in the FOIA/PA Division. (2) Receipt of the request will be acknowledged and it will be placed ina queue system as outlined in paragraphs andSection;andSection; 284.7(b) (5)through (9), of this Part. (3) These provisions also apply to a request received on referral fromanother DoD Component or government agency and time limits will begin onthe date of receipt in the OIG FOIA/PA Division. (f) <T3>Requests from Congress. </T3>(1) Records requested by a Member of Congress,or his/her staff, on behalf of a constituent will be processed as if theconstituent had written directly to the OIG, and in accordance with thepolicy established and the procedures set forth in this Part. (2) Records requested by a Member of Congress or his/her staff in an officialcapacity will be processed in accordance with DoD Directive 5400.4,\4\<NOTE/> ``Provision of Information to Congress.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ See footnote 2 to andSection; 284.5(b)(4). (g) <T3>Requests from the News Media. </T3>(1) Requests from news media representativesfor records that would not be exempt from release under the FOIA, or prohibitedfrom release under other statutory or regulatory authority, will be releasedpromptly by the OIG element originating the record. (2) Records containing information that is exempt from release under theFOIA, or prohibited from release under other statutory or regulatory authoritywill be reviewed for release under the provisions of the FOIA by the FOIA/PADivision, and the news media representatives will be so advised. (3) Extracts of the nonexempt portions of such records may be preparedin response to a specific request from a news media representative butwill be coordinated for release with the FOIA/PA Division. Extracts willbe prepared in accordance with the sample at Attachment to andSection; 284.5.(h) <T3>Referrals. </T3>(1) The OIG will refer a FOIA request to another DoDComponent or other government agency when the OIG has no records responsiveto the request, but believes or knows the other Component or agency mayhave, and any necessary coordination on the request has been effected withthe Component or agency. The requester will be notified of the referralwith the following exceptions: (i) If the existence or nonexistence of the record itself is classified,as determined by the other Component or agency, the OIG will so notifythe requester and will not refer the record. (ii) If the record falls under one or more of the ``Exclusions'' underthe FOIA (see Appendix B of this Part), as determined by the other Componentor agency, the OIG will advise the requester that there is no OIG recordand no further action will be taken. (2) The OIG will refer a record, or portions of a record held by the OIG,that originated with another DoD Component or Government agency to thatComponent or agency (unless the agency is not subject to the FOIA) fora release determination and/or direct response to the requester, afterany necessary coordination. The requester will be notified of any suchreferral, consistent with any security requirements and ``Exclusion'' provisionsof the FOIA. (3) The OIG will refer a FOIA request for a classified record that it holds,but did not originate, to the originating DoD Component or government agency.If the record originated with the OIG but the classification is derivative,i.e., contains classified information that originated elsewhere and wasincorporated in the OIG record, the record will be referred to the originatingauthority with a recommendation for release. (4) The OIG may also refer a request for a record that was originated bythe OIG for the use of another DoD Component or government agency, to thatComponent or agency with a recommendation for release, after any necessarycoordination. The requester will be notified of such action consistentwith any security requirements or ``Exclusion'' provisions of the FOIA.(5) A FOIA request for investigative, intelligence, or any other type ofrecords on loan from other DoD Components or agencies to the OIG for aspecific purpose, will not be honored if the records are restricted fromfurther release and so marked. Such requests will be referred to the Componentor agency that provided the records. (6) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, all requestersseeking National Security Council (NSC) or White House documents will beadvised that they should write directly to the NSC or White House for suchdocuments. OIG/DoD documents in which the NSC or White House has a concurrentreviewing interest will be forwarded by the FOIA/PA Division to the Director,Freedom of Information and Security Review (DFOISR), Office of the AssistantSecretary of Defense (OASD) (Public Affairs), which shall effect coordinationwith the NSC or White House, and return the documents to the originatingagency after NSC review and determination. The FOIA/PA Division will forwardany documents found in OIG files that are responsive to the FOIA requestto DFOISR, OASD (Public Affairs) for their coordination with the NSC orWhite House, and return to the OIG with a release determination for finalprocessing of the request. (7) The Government Accounting Office (GAO) is outside of the ExecutiveBranch, therefore, requests for GAO documents containing DoD information,either received directly from requesters or as referrals from GAO, willbe processed as follows: (i) FOIA requests received directly by the OIG for unclassified or classifiedGAO documents containing OIG/DoD information (including GAO documents unidentifiedas to classification) will be transferred by the FOIA/PA Division to theappropriate GAO office for their action, and the requester will be advisedaccordingly. (ii) FOIA requests referred from the GAO for those documents containingOIG/DoD information will be processed in accordance with the proceduresfor security review and mandatory declassification review as set forthin DoD Directive 7650.2,\5\<NOTE/> ``General Accounting Office Audits and Reports''.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ See footnote 2 to andSection; 284.5(b)(4).(i)<T3> For Official Use Only (FOUO).</T3> The use of FOUO markings will beaccomplished in accordance with the provisions of Appendix A of this Part,and exemptions (b)(2) through (b)(9) as set forth in Appendix B of thisPart. Additional guidance will be provided to OIG elements, as needed,by the FOIA/PA Division.(j)<T3> Use of Exemptions.</T3> (1) An exempted record, other than those beingwithheld pursuant to exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3) or (b)(6), will be madeavailable upon request from a member of the public when, in the judgmentof the Initial Denial Authority (IDA), Appellate Authority or other higherauthority, no jeopardy to Government interest would occur if release ismade. Such judgments will be on a case-by-case basis.(2) If a record requested under the FOIA meets the exemption (b)(4) withholdingcriteria set forth in this Part, the OIG will not ordinarily exercise itsdiscretionary power to release, absent circumstances in which a compellingpublic interest would be served by release of the record.(3) The categories of records which are exempted from release, i.e., maybe withheld in whole or in part, are identified in Appendix B of this Part.(k)<T3> Fees and Fee Waivers.</T3> (1) Fees will be assessed under the FOIAas set forth in Chapter VI of DoD 5400.7-R.(2) Requesters must indicate their willingness to pay fees in their initialFOIA request. If a waiver of fees is requested, a statement regarding theirwillingness to pay fees in the event a waiver or reduction of fees is deniedis still required. Any requests not containing a statement regarding awillingness to pay assessed fees will not be processed and the requesterwill be so advised.(3) Fees will not be required to be paid in advance of processing the requestfor release of the records requested except:(i) When the requester is known to be in default of payment of fees incurredin connection with a previous request.(ii) When the total amount of estimated fees assessable to the requesterexceeds $250.00 and waiver is not appropriate, a ``good faith'' depositof half of the amount of the estimated fees may be required before completingthe processing of the request, or providing the requested records.(4) Fee waivers will be granted on a case-by-case basis; and, in any requestfor waiver of fees, the requester must provide sufficient information toenable the IDA to make a proper determination of whether or not the feesshould be waived.(5) Requests for waivers merely stating that release would be in the publicinterest, identifying a tax status of the requester, or asserting an intentionto make the record public will not be considered to provide sufficientpersuasive information upon which to make a determination. In such cases,the requester shall be so informed and given the opportunity to submitadditional justification. Absent such justification, the requester maybe required to pay fees appropriate to his/her category, if provision ofthe information is determined not to be in the public interest or benefit.(6) Ordinarily, fees will not be assessed to a FOIA requester where a searchfor records was unproductive, or where all responsive records are denied.(7) Payments of fees must be by check or U.S. Postal money order made payableto the Treasurer of the United States. Cash payments cannot be accepted.(1)<T3> Appeals and Judicial Action.</T3> (1) All appeals should be receivedby the OIG no later than 60 calendar days after the date of the initialdenial letter. In cases where incremental release actions have been takeon an initial request, the time for the appeal will not begin until thedate of the last denial of release letter.(2) A ``no record'' finding may not be appealed; however, the requestermay ask the OIG to conduct another search of files if more detailed informationis provided that will assist in the additional search.(3) All final decisions rendered on appeals will be made to the requestersin writing by the Appellate Authority, after consultation with the Officeof General Counsel representative to the OIG, and other appropriate OIGelements.(4) A requester will be deemed to have exhausted his/her administrativeremedies after he/she has been denied the requested record, or waiver/reductionof fees, by the designated Appellate Authority, or when the OIG FOIA/PADivision fails to respond to the request within the time limits prescribedby the FOIA, DoD 5400.7-R and this Part. The requester may then seek judicialaction from a U.S. District Court in the district in which the requesterresides, has a principal place of business, in the district in which therecord is located, or in the District of Columbia.(m)<T3> Authentication of Records.</T3> Records provided under the FOIA willbe authenticated upon written request, to fulfill an official Governmentor other legal function. A fee of $5.20 may be charged for each such authentication.(n)<T3> Privileged Release to Officials.</T3> (1) Subject to the provisionsof DoD Regulation 5200.1-R,\6\<NOTE/> ``Information Security Program Regulation'', applicable toclassified information, DoD Directive 5400.11,\7\<NOTE/> ``Department of Defense Privacy Program'', and 32 CFR Part286a or other applicable law; records exempt from release under AppendixB of this Part may be authenticated and released to officials requestingthem on behalf of local, state, or Federal Governmental bodies, whetherlegislative, executive, administrative, or judicial, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ See footnote 3 to andSection; 283.5(c)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ See footnote 2 to andSection; 284.5(b)(4).

Requestsmust also contain a statement regarding willingness to pay fees. (3) A request for a personal record or investigative record pertainingto the individual making the request, that is in a system of records whethernonexempt or exempted from mandatory release under the Privacy Act, mustbe notarized to avoid the risk of invasion of personal privacy. In anysuch request, the individual may designate another individual to act ashis/her representative in making the request and in receiving the recordson his/her behalf; however, the authorization must be in writing, specificiallyname the representative and kinds of records authorized to be provided,and be notarized to avoid the risk of invasion of personal privacy. (4) A request for a record that was obtained from a non-U.S. Governmentsource, or containing information that was provided by a non-U.S. Governmentsource, and that is subject to exemption (b)(4) under the FOIA, will bereleased to the individual or firm making the request without further exception,if:(i) The individual or firm is clearly the submitter of the informationand/or is clearly acting on behalf of the submitter in making the request.(ii) The request contains a statement from a company official or otherrepresentative of the submitter clearly capable of certifying that therequester is acting on behalf of the submitter of the information in makingthe request; i.e., a Vice-President certifies on his/her company letterheadthat XYZ Law Firm is acting on behalf of the company in requesting copiesof documents submitted to the government by the company. A mere assertionby the requester that the requester is acting on behalf of the submitterin making the request will not be honored, if it can not be readily verifiedthrough records available to the OIG. (5) Requests misdirected to other OIG elements will be forwarded promptlyto the FOIA/PA Division. The statutory period allowed for response to arequest misdirected by the requester shall not begin until the requestis received in the FOIA/PA Division. The OIG field elements receiving misdirectedrequests should advise the requester that the request is being forwardedto the office having the authority to act on and respond to the request.(b) <T3>Processing Requests. </T3>(1) Upon receipt in the FOIA/PA Division,a request for records will be assigned a control number, logged, and reviewedfor adequacy and compliance with the procedures for submitting requestsoutlined in andSection; 284.6(a). (2) If the request does not meet the adequacy of description test, containa statement regarding fees, and/or contain a notarization/authorizationor certification of submitter representation, if applicable; it will notbe processed until the requester has been notified and allowed the opportunityto comply with the procedures. If the requester does not comply withinthe time allowed (generally 30 calendar days) in the notice, the requestwill be closed, and the requester so notified. (3) When it is determined that a request complies with all applicable procedures,the necessary search and collection of responsive records will be initiatedthrough the element or elements of the OIG likely to have custodianshipof the sought records. (4) Where the appropriate OIG element has determined that no record responsiveto the request exists, the POC for the element will advise the FOIA/PADivision. The requester will be so notified in writing by the IDA within10 working days from the date of receipt of the request. (5) When responsive records have been located, the POC for the OIG elementhaving the records will forward the records to the FOIA/PA Division witha recommendation for release. The FOIA/PA Division will make an initialreview, determine the placement of the request in the established queuesystem; and, within 10 working days, forward to the requester in writing,an acknowledgment of receipt of the request. The acknowledgment will adviseof the request's location within the queue system and of the determinationmade of whether to comply with the request and the reasons therefore. (6) Requests that have been placed in the queue system will be processedon a first-in-first-out basis within each queue and the responsive recordswill be provided at the time the request comes up in the queue for finalprocessing. The requester will be advised of any documents or portionsthereof determined to be exempt from release by the IDA and the specificexemptions that apply, at that time, along with the procedures for appealand addressing of an appeal, and of the fees due. (7) When it is determined that the fees assessable to a request undergoingfinal processing may exceed the limit established by the requester, orbe in excess of $250, the processing will be discontinued and the requesternotified so that he/she may advise of his/her desire to continue. If a``good faith'' deposit is required, the requester will be allowed a reasonabletime (generally 30 calendar days) in which to provide payment. If the requesterfails to provide the ``good faith'' deposit within the time allowed, therequest will be closed and the requester so notified. (8) The queue system consists of the following categories: (i) Those requests which are undergoing initial search and collection procedures_00.(ii) Those requests undergoing appeal of fees, fee waiver/reduction denials,and denial of access_01. (iii) Those requests involving records in the process of being createdor compiled on open investigations and ongoing inspections or audits_02.(iv) Those requests involving completed investigations, inspections andaudits or other records, for which the responsive records are small involume_03. (v) Those requests involving completed investigations, inspections andaudits or other records, for which the responsive records are large involume_04. (vi) Those requests that have been referred from other DoD Components orGovernment agencies, along with any OIG-originated records contained intheir files_05. (vii) Those requests for records made under the Privacy Act, whether ornot in a system of records exempt from the Privacy Act_06. (viii) Those requests for which no responsive records were found_07. (ix) Those requests undergoing litigation, whether or not a final determinationhas been made for the release of responsive records_08. (9) The amount of time spent on processing requests in a queue will beproportional to the volume of requests for each queue; i.e., if 25 percentof the requests are located in the 03 queue category, 25 percent in the02 queue category and 10 percent in the 04 queue category, then 25 percentof the weekly available manhours will be spent processing 03 queue categoryrequests, 25 percent on 02 queue category requests, and 10 percent on 04queue category requests. Notwithstanding this volume of requests criteria,unusual circumstances may require a temporary reallocation of availablemanhours among the categories on a limited basis as determined by the AssistantDirector, FOIA/PA Division. (c) <T3>Records of Non-U.S. Government Sources. </T3>(1) When it is determinedthat the records or data contained within the records responsive to a requestwere obtained from a non-U.S. Government source by the OIG, and the requesteris not the submitter of the non-U.S. Government material nor acting asthe submitter's representative; and it is further determined the sourceor submitter may have a valid objection to release of the material, thesubmitter will be promptly notified of the request and afforded a reasonabletime (generally 30 calendar days) to present any objections to the release.(2) This procedure is required for those FOIA requests for data not deemedclearly exempt from disclosure under exemption (b)(4). It is not requiredfor FOIA requests for data which may or may not be exempt under the remainingFOIA exemptions where it is clear there can be no valid basis for objectionby the source or submitter. If, for example, the record or data was submittedby the non-U.S. Government source with the actual or presumptive knowledgeof the source, and established that it would be made available to the publicupon request, there is no requirement to notify the source. (3) All objections will be evaluated. When a substantial issue has beenraised, the OIG may seek additional information and afford the source andrequester reasonable opportunities to present their arguments on the legaland substantive issues involved prior to making a determination. (4) The OIG will not ordinarily exercise its discretionary authority torelease information clearly meeting the exemption (b)(4) criteria. Further,the final decision to disclose information not deemed to clearly meet exemption(b)(4) criteria will be made by an official equivalent in rank or greaterto the official who would make the decision to withhold that data undera FOIA appeal.(5) When the source or submitter advises of the intent to seek a restrainingorder or to take court action to prevent release of the data, the requesterwill be notified and action will not be taken on the request until afterthe outcome of the court action is known. When the requester brings courtaction to compel disclosure, the source shall be promptly notified of thisaction. (6) These procedures also apply to any non-U.S. Government record in thepossession and control of the OIG from multi-national organizations, suchas NATO and NORAD, or foreign governments. Coordination of such FOIA requestswith foreign governments will be made through the Department of State bythe FOIA/PA Division. (d) <T3>Coordination with Department of Justice. </T3>(1) Where the custodianof an OIG element determines that records responsive to a FOIA requestare pertinent to pending or potential litigation involving the United States,the FOIA/PA POC for the element shall promptly notify the FOIA/PA Divisionso that the necessary coordination can be effected with the Office of GeneralCounsel (OGC) representative to the OIG. (2) The OGC representative shall effect all necessary coordination withthe United States Attorney and/or Department of Justice prior to any releaseof such records. (e) <T3>Denials of Records. </T3>(1) When requests are denied in whole or inpart, the requester will be informed in writing of the reasons for thedenial, the identity of the official making the denial, the right of appealof the decision, and the identity and address of the official to whom anappeal may be made. (2) Other than statutory denials, there are seven other reasons for notcomplying with a request for a record: (i) The request is transferred to another DoD Component or Federal agency.(ii) The request is withdrawn by the requester. (iii) The information requested is not a record within the meaning of theFOIA and andSection; 284.4(a) of this Part. (iv) A record has not been sufficiently described so that a reasonablesearch can be conducted by the OIG. (v) The requester has failed unreasonably to comply with the proceduralrequirements, including the payment of fees, imposed by 32 CFR Part 286and this Part. (vii) The OIG has determined through knowledge of its files and reasonablesearch efforts that it neither controls nor possesses the requested record.(viii) The record meets the ``Exclusion'' provisions of the FOIA. (f) <T3>Procedures for Appeals. </T3>(1) Appeals of denials to access of requestedrecords, fees assessed and fee waiver/reduction denials must be in writingand addressed to the Assistant Director, FOIA/PA Division (FOIA Appeal),AIG for Investigations, Room 1016, 400 Army Navy Drive, Arlington, VA 22202.(2) All appeals should provide sufficient information and justificationupon which a determination may be made by the Appellate Authority as towhether to grant or deny the appeal. A copy of the initial request andinitial denial letter should be included. (3) Acknowledgment of receipt of appeals will be made in writing within10 working days and the requester advised of its location within the appealqueue category. Review will be undertaken of the appeal and the denieddocuments and a recommendation made to the Appellate Authority, who willmake the final determination. The requester will be advised in writingwithin 20 working days of the initial determination of whether to complywith the appeal. (4) If the appeal is approved in part or in whole, the requester will beinformed and provided the records determined to be releasable. For recordsgranted in part, the requester will be advised of the right to judicialreview for the denied portions. (5) If the appeal is denied, the requester will be informed of the rightto judicial review. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 284.8 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Annual Report. </ITAG>The FOIA Annual Report, assigned Report Control System DD-PA (A) 1365,will be prepared by the FOIA/PA Division for the preceding calendar yearand submitted to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) onor before February 1 of each year.

Whendetermining whether a release is ``clearly unwarranted,'' the public interestin satisfying this purpose must be balanced against the sensitivity ofthe privacy interest being threatened. One example of such is lists ofnames and duty addresses of DoD personnel (civilian and military) assignedto units that are sensitive, routinely deployable, or stationed in foreignterritories. Release of such information could aid in the targeting ofDoD employees and their families by terrorists (see also paragraph (2)(c)under exemption (b)(2)).
