The high court let stand a $35 million verdict won by theFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. against a Louisianalaw firm, Mmahat andamp; Duffy, that advised Gulf Federal SavingsBank. The law firm raised a number of legal challenges to amalpractice suit filed against it.</LP><TEXT>   Gulf Federal, a Metairie, La., thrift, was declaredinsolvent and placed in receivership in 1986 by the FederalHome Loan Bank Board. In 1987, its operations were taken overby Pelican Homestead andamp; Savings Association, also in Metairie.   When the FSLIC was named receiver for Gulf Federal, itsued the officers, directors and lawyers. The officers anddirectors settled, agreeing to pay the agency $1.9 million. Afederal court jury in Louisiana awarded the FSLIC $35 millionagainst John Mmahat and the law firm for advising thefederally insured Gulf Federal to disregard limits on theamounts of loans it could make to individual borrowers. Afederal appeals court in New Orleans upheld the verdict,although it ordered the district court to reduce the damagesby the amount of the settlement.   Yesterday, the high court refused to hear an appeal by Mr.Mmahat and the firm.   Due to changes in bank regulatory laws, the case againstthe law firm has been pursued by the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. The tactic of suing lawyers that advisedfailed thrifts also has been pursued by the Resolution TrustCorp., which superceded the bank board and FSLIC.

Rutland, former chairman of MMR Holding Corp.

(Rutland vs. U.S.)   -- Refused an appeal by airline pilots challenging theFederal Aviation Administration's refusal to exempt them froma rule prohibiting pilots who are 60 or older from flyingcommercial planes that hold more than 30 passengers. Thepilots challenged the rule, adopted in 1959, on the groundthat federal law authorizes the FAA to grant exemptions andthat the agency had refused to approve any exemptions. (Bakervs. FAA)   -- Let stand a federal appeals court ruling that requiredColorado Interstate Gas Co., a Coastal Corp. unit, to stopbilling another pipeline company $15 million annually inminimum charges. The Denver appeals court upheld the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission's order that the Coastal unitstop using a minimum bill to recover from customers some ofthe fixed costs of maintaining the pipeline and ofmaintaining gas supplies at levels high enough to servecustomers' demands.
