The uptake was prominentwhen compared to Tc-99m MDP, I-123 IMP, and Ga-67 citrate. Brain imagingwith Tc-99m HM-PAO and N-isopropyl-p-[I-123] iodoamphetamine (IMP) isnow frequently performed. Uptake of these agents has been reported inbrain tumors and melanomas. In this report, uptake of Tc-99m HM-PAO ina metastatic lesion in bone is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
