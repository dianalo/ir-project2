Let's get him!&quot; cries Sam Donaldson, running up the stairs in the packed convention center here. Into his microphone, he yells to the ABC News control booth, &quot;I've got Willie Brown! I've got Willie Brown!&quot;    But CBS reporter Bill Plante has also spotted Mr. Brown, Jesse Jackson's campaign chairman, and a race is on. The ABC newsman gets there first, nearly knocking Mr. Brown's drink from his hand in the process. But as Mr. Donaldson gloats at the prospect of an exclusive interview, he gets bad news in his earphones: ABC doesn't have time to put him on the air.    Sam Donaldson is one of the highest-paid correspondents in television news, photographed by delegates, stalked by autograph hunters. But even a celebrity like Mr. Donaldson is fighting for every minute of air time he can get at this week's Democratic national convention. The budget-conscious networks, worried about boring viewers, and thereby losing them, have cut back their traditional coverage of the political conventions to an unprecedented two hours a night, with an extra, optional hour or so scheduled for breaking stories. Mr. Donaldson, 54 years old, isn't at all happy about the change.    &quot;This year, the floor is like Siberia,&quot; he laments. &quot;Boy, I've never worked less hard in my life.&quot;    Until 1984, the networks covered the conventions virtually from the opening to the closing gavel. But this year, by summarizing most events and broadcasting in full only a few key speeches, the networks will cover the conventions every evening in less time than it takes to air the average made-for-television movie. Less coverage means less staff needed on the floor and in control booths, and that means big savings for the networks.    Some television executives, though, are worried about filling even two hours a night, given how predictable the Democratic convention is this year. &quot;Frankly, I'm trying to find intelligent things to say tonight during the roll call,&quot; worries one network official. Things could be worse at the no-surprises-expected Republican convention next month. Partly as a result of this year's sedate events, the networks already are talking about further reducing convention coverage in 1992, to just two days from the current four.    &quot;The networks may be on their way to not even covering conventions in the next presidential election&quot; with a full team on the scene, says Fred Friendly, former president of CBS News. &quot;You will watch this year the end of an era in convention coverage.&quot;    Many political analysts think the cutbacks are justified, especially at a largely prearranged convention like Atlanta's. &quot;The networks are cutting back because the convention is a love feast and is absolutely boring,&quot; says political scientist Austin Ranney. Viewership of political conventions has declined markedly and networks &quot;don't want to bore their viewers,&quot; he adds.    But others worry that dwindling network coverage of the conventions denies the public a quadrennial lesson in American politics. &quot;When the networks covered gavel to gavel, the viewing public had to watch at least some of the conventions,&quot; says Charles Ferris, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. &quot;Now the public has the great luxury of not having to care. It accelerates the public's drift away from an interest in politics and will certainly affect the capacity of Americans to govern in the long term.&quot;    Network officials predictably disagree and contend that less can be more. &quot;Nothing in the Constitution says the networks have to give a civics lesson,&quot; insists NBC commentator John Chancellor, who is covering his 17th convention this week. &quot;In 1956, when Eisenhower and the Republicans had pompon girls, we covered it. This year, we won't cover the hoopla, but rather the story of the day. The viewers will be served.&quot;    Cable networks and local stations are filling some of the void created by the network cutbacks. Cable News Network and C-Span, which reach 50% of American homes, will broadcast all the Democratic convention this week. And because of new satellite broadcast technology, 338 local TV stations have reporters in Atlanta, increasing the number of local TV journalists covering the convention by 1,000 from the level in 1984. Some 13,500 foreign and domestic reporters are in Atlanta this week.    This year's reduced network coverage draws to a close the glory days when floor reporting was a choice assignment and floor reporters became fabled figures. Back in the 1960s, for example, NBC called Mr. Chancellor, Edwin Newman, Sander Vanocur and Frank McGee its &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; because of their aggressive reporting at the conventions.    TV viewers saw Mr. Chancellor being dragged out of the 1964 Republican convention in San Francisco when, during a live interview, he refused to clear an aisle. Mr. Chancellor ended his broadcast with &quot;This is John Chancellor, somewhere in custody.&quot;    CBS's Dan Rather was punched to the floor at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago while covering the ejection of a Georgia delegate. That prompted anchorman Walter Cronkite to declare furiously on the air: &quot;I think we've got a bunch of thugs down there.&quot;    Television coverage of the conventions is changing in part because conventions themselves have changed. In many cases, they have become little more than a grandiose advertisement for the political party. &quot;Because the candidates are known before the conventions, the conventions now serve to launch their campaigns with symbols and propaganda,&quot; says Michael Robinson, a Georgetown University professor specializing in press and politics. &quot;TV news had to adjust to that change.&quot;    And adjust to smaller audiences as well. According to A.C. Nielsen Co., only 32% of the nation's households watching television were tuned to the networks on Monday, the first night of this week's convention. On Tuesday, the figure jumped to 45%, chiefly because Jesse Jackson was speaking. Still, that is a huge drop from two decades ago, when more than 80% of households watched convention broadcasts. &quot;There's so much else on TV these days&quot; pulling viewers away from the networks, says Mr. Vanocur, now with ABC News.    The lower ratings affect the networks' bottom line because a smaller audience means they have to charge less for commercials. NBC, for example, will charge about $60,000 for a 30-second spot during this week's convention. It charges about $183,000 for a 30-second commercial during a popular prime-time program such as &quot;Golden Girls&quot; and a huge $370,000 a spot during the top-rated &quot;Cosby&quot; show.    So it is that convention coverage has been cut, leaving Sam Donaldson an exasperated floor reporter. A couple of hours before the opening gavel Monday night, he senses this convention won't be a glorious one for him. Powdering his face in the makeup room, he tells commentator George Will: &quot;George, the fact is we're not going to get on the air much.&quot;    His fears prove correct. On Monday Mr. Donaldson is on for a scant 3 1/2 minutes and on Tuesday, for only five. For one spot, he is told to give delegate reaction to the keynote address in &quot;no more than 35 seconds.&quot;    Then Mr. Donaldson comes up with a ploy to get on the air longer. It's interesting, he tells his producer, that a year ago, the Democrats were saying the Iran-Contra scandal would be a major campaign issue, but tonight they are only mentioning it in passing. He suggests an interview with a member of the investigating panel. The control booth buys the idea but only wants 1 1/2 minutes. Mr. Donaldson scurries to Sen. George Mitchell in the Maine delegation, microphone in hand. In the old days, he laments after the spot, &quot;we got five minutes for an interview.&quot;    Later, when former President Jimmy Carter's speech runs long, ABC stays with it, broadcasting past 11 p.m. Mr. Donaldson is excited when the control booth sends word that the network may do a &quot;whiparound&quot; of the floor correspondents to draw conclusions about the convention's first night. He whispers to his camera crew that they may get on one more time. But then the booth decides it won't come to Mr. Donaldson, and his floor producer tells him instead to &quot;stand by for 'Nightline,'&quot; for which he will provide commentary. Dejected, he refuses and walks off the floor. &quot;Nightline&quot; goes on the air without him.    Still, Mr. Donaldson does better than other correspondents. After the first night's broadcast, ABC correspondent Jim Wooten says sarcastically: &quot;I got on twice -- you know, when they did the wide shots of the podium.&quot; And when CBS correspondent Lesley Stahl passes by, Mr. Donaldson calls out, &quot;Tell us the truth, did you get on the air?&quot; Ms. Stahl tells the anxious ABC News group: &quot;I got on once, and my mike went dead.&quot;    &quot;We're commiserating,&quot; Mr. Donaldson explains to a bystander. &quot;We may be competitors, but we all feel frustration tonight.&quot; Then he predicts: &quot;Unfortunately, it's only going to get worse.&quot;    On Tuesday night, it does. Mr. Donaldson spends 30 minutes trying to sell the control booth on an interview with Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus. He has the governor stand up, then sit down because the booth isn't interested. So Mr. Donaldson goes into his hard sell: &quot;This fits with what you're talking about,&quot; he pleads with his producers. &quot;Let's not lose the moment.&quot; He gets the go-ahead. Gov. Mabus stands up again, and Mr. Donaldson goes on live for a precious one minute.    Next, the ABC floor reporter spots former New York City Mayor John Lindsay, and calls to the control booth: &quot;He's coming toward me. Are you interested?&quot; Apparently, the control booth isn't because when Mr. Lindsay asks Mr. Donaldson how he's doing, the newsman replies: &quot;There's not much for a floor correspondent to do.&quot;    At other times, though, floor reporters are everything to the networks -- the frontline troops in the competitive battle for news stories, albeit short news stories these days. When Jesse Jackson finishes his stirring speech Tuesday night, the control booth tells Mr. Donaldson there is heavy security on one side of the stage, a sign that the candidate may come onto the floor. The newsman fights his way to the stage, only to find CBS's Ed Bradley and Ms. Stahl already in place.    When Mr. Jackson indeed heads to the floor, the correspondents are fighting for position. Mr. Bradley gets in the first question, but Mr. Donaldson never acknowledges defeat. &quot;Bradley was holding the microphone,&quot; he says. &quot;I was conducting the interview.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
