Foreign Minister Pik Botha of South Africa said Wednesday hiscountry had placed its troops on alert and was prepared to delaythe Nov. 7-11 balloting because of the alleged incursion fromAngola.   Botha said U.N. soldiers reported in internal radio traffic theinfiltration of 600 guerrillas of the South-West Africa People'sOrganization over six days ending Tuesday.   ``We believe the messages are phony in content and format,''U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a news conference.   He said U.N. communications experts and military personnelexamined the information provided by South African officials anddetermined ``the messages do not emanate from any (United Nations)source.''   Eckhard declined to comment when asked whether the U.N. believedthe South Africans fabricated the radio messages or if it was partof a hoax by another party.   Northern Namibia was ``exceptionally calm'' today, Eckhard said.U.N. soldiers and territorial police were conducting regularpatrols along the Namibia-Angola border and had not reported anyevidence of an incursion.   The United Nations has 4,650 soldiers in Namibia monitoring theterritory's transition to independence from South Africa.   SWAPO's secretary for information, Hidipo Hamutanya, todayrejected Botha's claims, saying ``the whole thing is a smokescreenby South Africa to influence the outcome of the elections.''   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia today said the South Africantroop alert nearly plunged southern Africa into ``catastrophe'' andthat South Africa feared a guerrilla victory at the polls.   ``They want to forestall that victory,'' Kaunda told a newsconference in the Zambian capital Lusaka. ``They want to throw thewhole region into turmoil.''   Kaunda, chairman of the six-nation Frontline States bloc inconfrontation with South Africa, said SWAPO president Sam Nujomaassured him there was no pre-election buildup of guerrillas.   Martti Ahtisaari, the head of the U.N. contingent, saidWednesday night the allegations of a SWAPO incursion were beingforwarded to a military monitoring commission made up of SouthAfricans, Angolans and Cubans who meet daily in the northern townof Oshakati.   The three countries signed a treaty last year under which SouthAfrica agreed to grant independence to Namibia, which it has ruledfor 74 years.   SWAPO, which waged a 23-year bush war against South Africanrule, denied any of its guerrillas were crossing into Namibia. Theorganization is favored to get the most votes in next week'sballoting for seats in an assembly that will draft a constitution.   Just 75,000 of the territory's 1.3 million people are white.   Under a U.N. plan, SWAPO is not supposed to have armed forces inthe territory during the transition. South Africa has withdrawn itstroops, and law enforcement is being carried out by the integratedterritorial police.   Botha said Wednesday of the alleged incursion: ``Unless this isresolved within days, the South African government is reserving theright to take whatever steps would be required to ensure that allparties comply with their obligations.''   Hamutenya said SWAPO still had 300 guerrillas in Angola, butthey were far north of the border and in compliance with allinternational agreements.   The chief of the South African Defense Force, Gen. JannieGeldenhuys, said Wednesday that thousands of SWAPO guerrillas wereviolating agreements by being in southern Angola within 120 milesof the Namibian border.   He made no mention of guerrillas infiltrating Namibia.   On April 1, the official starting day of the transitionalperiod, South Africa announced that hundreds of SWAPO guerrillashad crossed into Namibia from Angola in violation of internationalagreements.   About 280 guerrillas and 27 members of the security forces werekilled in subsequent fighting, according to South Africa, whichreceived U.N. permission to deploy its troops against SWAPO.   Botha warned Wednesday that if the alleged incursion does notend ``there cannot be a free and fair election. That must beobvious.''   Botha said he met Wednesday with ambassadors of the UnitedStates, Britain, Canada, West Germany, France and other countries,urging them to do what they can ``to end this now.''   He said he had been in contact with Ahtisaari and U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, but declined to say whatthey told him.   The treaty that paved the way for Namibia's independence alsocalls for Cuba to remove its 50,000 soldiers from Marxist-ruledAngola. Cuba announced earlier this week that 25,000 of the troopshad left on schedule.</TEXT></DOC>
