The QA is a regulatory requirement, butthe prudent plant management would create such a system as part of theirtotal project management systems irrespective of formulation of requirement.In fact regulatory requirement should be considered as the criteria tobe used by the regulatory organization for evaluation of licensee's QAsystem and not as an objective to be reached. In this paper the needsfor QA system are justified as part of the development of industrialinfrastructure for the nuclear power project. Elements of the systemare described such as documented QA programme and organizational structureswith defined responsibility and functions of individual organizationalunits, and with control of information flow across the interfaces. Thegoals and objectives or the project organizations related to achievementand verification of quality are defined as well as system functions inattaining these objectives. This includes the feedback of informationto the management on monitoring of performance in project activities,identifying deficiencies and initiating corrective actions. Domesticparticipation in the nuclear power plant construction will depend onthe ability of local construction and manufacturing organizations toachieve high quality standards of products and services that can affectsafety and performance of the nuclear power plant.
