(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Classified federal documents involvingnational security were found in the offices of a Korean-Americanbusinessman charged with trying to export large amounts of deadlynerve gas, officials said today.   U.S. Customs agents searching the Summit import-export businessof Juwhan Yun found lying on top of a desk papers in both Korean andEnglish marked ``Classified and confidential,'' Customs Agent FrankP. Ventura testified in U.S. District Court.   Ventura said military intelligence officials from Fort Monmouthidentified the documents as coming from the ``Joint ElectronicsWarfare Command.'' Officials did not explain the nature orresponsibility of the command.   Yun, 48, of Short Hills, was arrested Jan. 12 at what he thoughtwas to be a meeting with an arms supplier, who was actually aCustoms undercover agent. The arrest took place at the U.S. Customsoffices in Newark, where the meeting was arranged after aseven-month investigation.   Authorities said Yun sought to acquire missiles and militaryradar equipment for shipment to Iran.   Yun faces charges of conspiracy to violate the Arms ExportControl Act by trying to arrange shipments of 500 quarter-ton bombsof sarin, a nerve gas. Authorities said they believe the gas wasintended for Iran, but they added that has not been verified.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Singer disclosed the existence ofthe classified documents after Yun's attorney, Stephen Dratch, saidhis client was able to meet $2 million bail set Tuesday by U.S.Magistrate Ronald Hedges.   Ms. Singer said Yun's possession of the documents increased therisk that he would flee because he may have ties with foreigngovernments. Those governments, Ms. Singer said, now may have avested interest in keeping Yun from standing trial in the case.   Hedges asked Ms. Singer if the documents indicated espionage. Ms.Singer declined to comment.   Yun's possession of the documents might expose him to a moreserious charge of unauthorized possession of secret documents, Ms.Singer said.   ``He was apparently in the process of using them,'' she said. Shedid not elaborate.   Ms. Singer said the contents of the papers were not relevant toYun's bail status, but involved national security.</TEXT></DOC>
