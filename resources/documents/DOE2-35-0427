Studies included:the dissolution of asbestos minerals in neutral salt solutions; electrooxidationof cinnabar, and the importance of parameters such as salt concentration,ore particle size, current density, treatment rate in amps per ton ore,electrode composition, electrode spacing, and temperature on the mercurycontent of the calcine; the use of a new analytical method based on x-rayemission induced by the passage of energetic protons through mineralsamples for the performance of trace-metal analyses of asbestos minerals;adsorption of carboxylic groups of ferric-oxide and hematite, in relationto a new class of collectors, the amphoteric surfactants; the correlationbetween nickel and magnesium dissolution from chrysotile in 1 normalhydrochloric-acid and 1 normal acetic-acid solutions; injection of Swiss-Webster-micein the flank with amosite suspended in physiological saline to investigatefiber distribution via the lymphatic system; and injection of Wistarrats in the thoracic cavity with asbestos samples to study the carcinogenesisof asbestos fibers as related to surface chemistry.</TEXT></DOC>
