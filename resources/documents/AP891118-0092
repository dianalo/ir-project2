(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The space shuttle launch team wasabout 12 hours behind schedule Saturday as it worked towardstarting the countdown for the Thanksgiving Eve liftoff of shuttleDiscovery, NASA said.   ``It's a very tight schedule, but we're still targeting thelaunch for Wednesday the 22nd,'' said space agency spokeswoman LisaMalone, who blamed the delay on ``a bunch of little things.''   The secret military mission, which sources said will include thedeployment of a spy satellite, is expected to last four days.   Malone said launch officials were assessing where the lost timecould be made up before the scheduled 4 p.m. Sunday countdownstart, and ``we'll regroup tomorrow morning and see where westand.''   Launch crews might be able pick up some time by speeding up theengine closeout Sunday, she said. Some time also might be made upby reducing the number of hours of contingency hold time includedin the countdown.   Time was lost during the week when engineers had to replace anelectronic control box on one of Discovery's two solid fuel boosterrockets, and ``a bunch of other little things also put us behind,''Malone said.   She said that if officials decide Sunday that they can't make aWednesday launch, they could delay the liftoff until Thursday, orput it off two days until Friday to allow most workers to spendThanksgiving at home.   ``We'll look at the weather forecast for Friday and the weekend,and if it looks good, we might reschedule for Friday,'' she said.``But we have not ruled out a Thanksgiving liftoff.''   Because the flight is classified, NASA and the Pentagon havesaid only that the launch will occur between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30p.m. They will not make the exact time public until just nineminutes before the planned liftoff.   Except for brief announcements on the shuttle reaching orbit andon the landing time, there will be a news blackout during themission unless something major goes wrong.   The flight is expected to last four days.   Sources close to the project said Discovery's payload is anintelligence satellite that will be able to listen in oncommunications networks of the Soviet Union and other countries.   The astronaut crew members will be commander Fred Gregory, pilotJohn Blaha and mission specialists Manley Carter Jr., StoryMusgrave and Kathy Thornton.</TEXT></DOC>
