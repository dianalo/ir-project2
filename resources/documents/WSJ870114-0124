She is now engaged in an increasingly tumultuous campaign on behalf of the country's draft constitution -- to be put to a plebiscite Feb. 2. She is not to be taken lightly when she calls this effort a vote &quot;for democracy.&quot; That makes it harder but no less urgent to say that the Philippine people deserve a better constitution on which to build their new republic. The one for which Mrs. Aquino is campaigning would most likely lead to a swamp of statism and a weak foreign policy.    As thrashed out by the Philippines' Constitutional Commission during the fall, the extremely long draft now includes 18 articles, subdivided into 305 sections. Many of these are further divided into elaborate categories. One grants a mandate for state promotion of sports; another permits public money to be paid to religious dignitaries if they work in leprosariums.    Constitutions are fundamentally guarantors of freedom, and freedom is best assured by a constitution that limits the powers of government, not one that explicitly creates a long list of all the activities in which the state shall involve itself. This proposed constitution embraces statist policies of a type that have beggared many Third World countries.    Consider section 12 of Article XII. It says the state &quot;shall promote the preferential use of Filipino labor, domestic materials, and locally produced goods, and adopt measures that help make them competitive.&quot; This is a dive back to the swamp of tariffs, licenses and subsidies in which Philippine businesses sank during the Marcos years.    The draft constitution also provides for &quot;security of tenure for labor,&quot; which in practice usually ends up keeping the poorest workers out of jobs by making potential employers reluctant to hire.    Nor is foreign policy immune from busy clauses. The much-discussed non-nuclear section is a real time bomb. It says: &quot;The Philippines, consistent with the national interest, adopts and pursues a policy of freedom from nuclear weapons in its territory.&quot; The ostrich policy of declaring oneself a nuclear-free zone is much in fashion now, but it hardly seems wise to embed it in a constitution.    A written text that unrolls for several yards is bound to include some good things; some are found in this constitution. There's a valuable separation of government powers, a respect for property and allowance for privatization of some public enterprises. There's even a line-item veto that lets the president cross out specific items in appropriation, revenue and tariff bills -- an example the U.S. could profitably follow. But the subconstitutional issues constitute heavy baggage.    Observers of the Philippine political scene fear that if this constitution is not ratified, chaos will follow. It is opposed by the far left, as well as by such mainstream critics of Mrs. Aquino as her former defense minister, Juan Ponce Enrile. But a constitution is serious business. This is the foundation on which development -- and democracy -- will stand or fall in the Philippines over the long run. Our interpretation of a &quot;no&quot; vote in February would be that the people of the Philippines very much favor democracy but want a constitution more certain to preserve it. </TEXT></DOC>
