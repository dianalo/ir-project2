They're everything the portable PC should be. You can use them while you walk around; you can scribble on them in longhand; and when you're done, your friends can add scribblings of their own.    Now one start-up company says it's found a way to nudge portable PCs toward that ideal. The company, Linus Technologies Inc. of Reston, Va., calls its machine a &quot;write-top.&quot; Instead of using a keyboard, the user writes on a glass screen with a stylus.    Linus's machine can convert handwriting into typed text, which can be printed out or transferred to another computer. First you need to enter your handwriting into the machine, so it can understand your graphological quirks.    The company expects to start shipping the machine this month. But don't toss all your pads of paper into the garbage yet. The machine has some limitations. You have to pick up the stylus between characters. The machine also converts handwriting at the sluggish pace of two symbols per second. And at $2,800 to $3,600, it will cost more than most conventional portable PCs.    Among those who will market the product is health-care giant Baxter International Inc., an early investor in Linus. Baxter is testing a version of the computer designed to let nurses keep track of the supplies they use in an emergency room. The company is developing another version that doctors would use to take notes as they visit hospital patients.    Software to Improve   Data-Base Searches   THE ELECTRONIC data bases of the U.S. Strategic Air Command, a keeper of the nation's bomber planes, contain two billion characters of information in intelligence reports from around the world.    Piecing together facts from that storehouse is crucial to the military decisions the U.S. makes. So it's important to be able to rummage through all that data quickly and efficiently. SAC tackled the problem in an unusual way, which is now becoming commercially available.    Most data-base search programs ask for lists of key words. Then they fish out documents that have those words. Searches can be limited by specifying how close to each other the key words must be, or by listing words to ignore, among other ways.    Verity Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., developed software for SAC that organizes documents in order of their relevance to a search, based on which key words they contain. A user can make some key words more important than others by assigning ratings, and the software weights the documents accordingly.    The need to quickly sort through large amounts of data crops up in other settings, too. Lawyers are increasingly computerizing huge volumes of litigation documents, but often aren't sure how to comb through them for hidden smoking guns. Anyone who's ever searched an electronic data base of news articles knows the worry that juicy tidbits are slipping through your net.    &quot;It's no longer a case that a document fits a search or it doesn't -- there have to be shades of gray,&quot; says Clifford Reid, a founder of Verity, which last month unveiled a commercial version of its software.    Helping Computers Read   Handwritten ZIP Codes   WHAT IS a '4'? And when is it really a '9'? A team of computer scientists is searching for the answer. Their work isn't an exercise in Zen philosophy, but it could bring enormous benefits to the world's largest repository of baffling numbers: the U.S. Postal Service.    The scientists work at the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, a leading center of research in computer vision. A group at the Ann Arbor-based institute, which normally designs electronic systems for heavy industrial or military work, has a contract from the Postal Service to teach a computer to read handwritten ZIP codes.    The post office already has machines that can read printed addresses -- used on about 85% of all letters. But designing an electronic eye for the rest of the mailbag is a thorny task. &quot;It turns out to be a very hard problem because it's not constrained,&quot; says Brian Mitchell, a leader of the Michigan team. &quot;We don't have the luxury of knowing that a '5' will always look a certain way.&quot;    There are other pitfalls in Mr. Mitchell's path. Envelopes with printed patterns confuse a computer. Some people use five-digit ZIP codes and some use nine-digit codes. Simply finding the ZIP code can be tricky for a computer.    The Michigan scientists are trying to define numbers by breaking them down into grids of 30-by-30 units, known as pixels. Even then, they are running into frustrating lookalikes. One scrawler's '21' passes for another's '4.' &quot;One or two pixels can make the difference between a '4' and a '9,'&quot; Mr. Mitchell says.    Odds and Ends   ART DIRECTORS in advertising and publishing already use personal computers to typeset articles, lay out pages, and make diagrams and drawings. Soon they'll also be able to fill their screens with photographs. Comstock, a big New York stock-photo agency, says it will offer the first photo catalogue -- with about 450 photos -- on a compact disk for personal computers. . . . What will be the top operating system for personal computers in 1992? Byte magazine posed that question to 5,000 attendees of a recent trade show. The top vote-getter, with 32%: OS/2, the system inside International Business Machines Corp.'s new line of personal computers. But DOS, the system inside IBM's previous line, trailed close behind with 30%, suggesting a big chunk of the industry is still resisting IBM's push for OS/2. </TEXT></DOC>
