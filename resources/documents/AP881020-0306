BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco Inc. saidThursday some of its top executives were considering taking thecompany private in a leveraged buyout, which, at nearly $17billion, would be the largest corporate acquisition in history.   The company, known for products that include Camel and Winstoncigarettes, Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers, also announced a 10.9percent increase in its third-quarter income.   The morning announcement of the possible $75-a-share offer _which came in the midst of takeover activity involving other bigfood companies _ sent RJR Nabisco's stock price soaring, but italso left investment analysts puzzled about the purpose and priceof the proposal.   RJR Nabisco said President F. Ross Johnson and Edward A.Horrigan Jr., chief executive of the company's tobacco business,had notified the firm they ``intend to seek to develop, with afinancial partner, a proposal to acquire RJR Nabisco in a leveragedbuyout merger transaction.''   The company said the group was considering offering about $75 incash for each of the company's approximately 225 million commonshares outstanding, making the proposal worth about $16.88 billion.   The company said late Thursday the offer will be reviewed by aspecial committee of outside directors led by Chairman Charles E.Hugel. The committee has retained investment bankers Dillon Read andamp;Co. Inc. and Lazard Freres andamp; Co. Inc. to advise it.   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said it was advising the managementgroup and would provide equity and financing for the deal.   Analysts said the proposal was too low, and investors apparentlyagreed. RJR Nabisco stock surged $21.37{ a share to $77.25 on theNew York Stock Exchange, where it was the most actively tradedissue.   ``Valuing Nabisco, as a food company and discounting the tobaccooperation, I arrive at a value somewhere between $85 and $90'' ashare, said Pavlos Alexandrakis, an analyst with Argus ResearchCorp. in New York.   ``I'm telling our clients to hold on to the stocks. I thinksomething else is going to happen,'' he said.   Lawrence Adelman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,said the deal was an indication of how undervalued RJR Nabisco'sstock was, having been driven lower by worries over recent tobaccoliability lawsuits.   But Adelman said investors currently are paying more attentionto companies' ability to generate cash rather than provideearnings, and that makes companies with undervalued stocksespecially attractive.   He said RJR Nabisco's stock should trade at between $90 and $100a share, and said Johnson, the company president, ``is trying tosteal the company'' at $75 a share.   Thursday's announcement moved Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., thecredit rating service, to place RJR Nabisco on its ``creditwatch''list because ``such a deal would severely weaken the firm's balancesheet.''   If the deal were completed, it would be the biggest leveragedbuyout of an American corporation by far. The largest LBO was the$6.1 billion buyout of Beatrice Cos. by an investment group led byKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. in 1986.   In a leveraged buyout, the buyer borrows the money to buy thecompany, then pays off the debt either through company revenue orselling off parts of the operation.   It also would surpass the biggest corporate acquisition, the$13.4 billion purchase of Gulf Corp. by Chevron Corp. in 1984.   Analysts speculated the management group was motivated byconcern that the company could become the target of another suitor.   The food industry has been awash with takeover bids of late. OnMonday, Philip Morris Cos. Inc. offered to buy processed foodsmanufacturer Kraft Inc. for $11 billion and Tuesday, Pillsbury Co.rejected a $5.23 billion bid from the British firm GrandMetropolitan PLC.   RJR Nabisco was formed when the tobacco company R.J. ReynoldsIndustries Inc. bought Nabisco Brands Inc., the food and consumerproducts giant, for $4.9 billion in 1985.   Johnson came to the conglomerate from Nabisco and last yearshifted the company's headquarters from Winston-Salem, N.C., toAtlanta in a move seen as an attempt to distance the company fromits tobacco beginnings.   The company's products are some of the best-known in thecountry, and also include Salem cigarettes, Lorna Doone andMallomar cookies, Chuckles and Junior Mints candy, Del Montevegetables and Milk-Bone dog biscuits.   It is currently test-marketing a smokeless cigarette, Premier.   In the quarter ended Sept. 30, RJR Nabisco said it earned $355million, or $1.55 per share, on sales of $4.16 billion, compared to$320 million, or $1.24 per share, on sales of $3.84 billion in thesame quarter last year.   Income from tobacco operations was $497 million in the quarteron sales of $1.78 billion, while food income accounted for $276million on $2.38 billion in sales.   For the first nine months of the year, the company said itearned $982 million, or $4.14 a share, up 17 percent from $839million, or $3.24 a share, in the same period a year earlier. Salesfor the first three quarters rose to $12.2 billion from $11.3billion.   In 1987, RJR Nabisco had profits of $1.18 billion on sales of$15.77 billion. That level of sales would make RJR Nabisco thethird largest privately held company in the country according toForbes magazine, behind Cargill, a commodity trading company, andSafeway Stores Inc., the grocery chain.   Earlier this year, the company announced a reorganization of itsfood business, separating its biscuit and grocery foods divisionsinto two free-standing operating companies. RJR Nabisco said themove would make it more responsive to changes in the marketplace.   In the past few years, the company has sold off divisions,including Kentucky Fried Chicken, that did not fit with itslong-range plans.</TEXT></DOC>
