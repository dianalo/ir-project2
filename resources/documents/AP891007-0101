BUDAPEST: the polls.</HEAD><TEXT>   The party leadership's commitment to free elections by June atthe latest, along with the acceptance of international human rightsprovisions, had put Hungary in the forefront of reform within theWarsaw Pact alliance even before Saturday's vote.   Only Poland, with the Soviet bloc's first government notcontrolled by Communists, has come as far as Hungary in itsdemocratic strivings.   The new party, which draws on socialist and communist ideals,supports ``humanism, freedom and democracy,'' the document stated.It seeks alliances with reform-oriented communist parties as wellas socialist and social democratic parties, according to theresolution.   Liberals grouped in the Reform Union faction had urged since thecongress opened Friday that the new party be free of CommunistParty conservatives. However, in a clear attempt to gain broadsupport the position paper avoided direct mention of cleansing ofranks.   It instead ``called into its ranks all those who agree with itsplatform, who accept the ground rules.'' But the document alsoprovided that members of the old party would not automatically bemembers of the new one by proposing that new membership booklets beissued by Nov. 10.   Originally even more wide-ranging in its intention to split withthe past, the reform leadership watered down the document lateSaturday to gain the support of the People's Democratic Forum _less progressive than the Reform Union but more liberal than theconservative groupings.   Members of the two liberal factions debated passionately _yelling could be heard from a conference hall at one point _ beforeagreement was reached on the compromise document.   The document declared the new party would support the concept ofprivate and state property, calling for ``a mixed property socialmarket economy,'' and ``the development of ... a multipartyparliamentary democracy.''   Communisat Party chairman Rezsoe Nyers, a moderate reformerappointed in an attempt to bridge ideological differences among thefour-member party leadership, praised the position paper as ``acompromise serving the rebirth of our party as a new left-wingSocialist Party.''   In a surprise turn, Nyers disclosed that former Politburo memberJanos Berecz, one of the most bitter opponents of reform at thecongress, had asked whether there was room for him in the new party.   ``I said `Yes, as a reform Communist,''' Nyers said to cheersfrom some of the delegates.   Earlier in the day Berecz had suggested he was ready to besacrificed for his communist ideals and said the rank-and-filemembership would not stand for substantive change.   ``You can tie me to a stake, but you can't do that to the720,000 party members represented by the delegates,'' he said toscattered boos and whistles.   The strong approval of the document was a blow to conservativesat the congress who had supported plans to make some changes in theexisting party but rejected founding a new one.   Berecz, who had lost his Politburo post in recent partyinfighting, had spoken bitterly of his liberal rivals earlierSaturday.   ``I want to conserve my communist past,'' he declared, addingthat differences with Imre Pozsgay, the leading reformer in thefour-man party leadership, ``truly put us in different parties.''   Pozsgay, the party candidate for the newly created governmentpost of president in the planned elections, had told reportersearlier he was closer to social democratic ideals than traditionalcommunist ones, which he said ``led to a dead end in EasternEurope, wherever they were tried.''   He described Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaignfor restructuring and openness as an encouraging ``wind for ourreforms,'' but emphasized that Hungary's decisions were independentof other countries.   Premier Miklos Nemeth, also a reformer and member of thecollective party leadership, told the delegates that the new partywould have no room ``for those who have blood on their hands'' frompast Communist Party excesses.   Another test of reform and conservative strength at the congresswas expected Sunday in voting on leadership posts.   Reformers, with nearly 500 committed delegates, represent thestrongest faction at the congress with staunch conservativesnumbering less than 100.   But several reformers said the conservatives were continuingefforts to win over the more than 700 publicly uncomitted delegates.</TEXT></DOC>
