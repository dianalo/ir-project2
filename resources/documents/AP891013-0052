But he emphasized he was not offering a blanketcommitment of American troops.   Ten days after an uprising against the Panamanian general wascrushed, Bush vigorously defended his handling of the situation,rejecting criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike over hisrefusal to provide U.S. military assistance.   He seemed particularly disturbed by charges that he abandonedthe rebels, leaving them on their own after publicly exhorting thePanamanian military to oust Noriega. Bush said that was ``a stupidargument that some very erudite people make.''   At a hurriedly called news conference, Bush also addressedpolitically charged issues in Congress. He said:   _ He opposes federal funding of abortions for poor women who arevictims of rape and incest but holds out hopes for a congressionalcompromise that would ``avoid a veto on my part.'' He said he would``see if there is room for flexibility'' when Senate and Housenegotiators work out a compromise version of a bill that now wouldallow such federal payments.   _ He will permit a bill outlawing flag burning to become lawwithout his signature. ``I don't think it's enough,'' Bush said,renewing his call for a constitutional amendment along the samelines but adding that he would not veto the legislation in themeantime.   _ He still wants Congress to approve his plan for a cut in thecapital gains tax, and he did not rule out the possibility ofsigning legislation that combined his proposal with a Democraticversion liberalizing individual retirement accounts. A few hourslater, Senate leaders agreed on a plan to strip hundreds ofspecial-interest provisions from a $14.1 billion deficit-reductionbill, leaving the capital gains fight for the future.   Asked about attempts in Congress to repeal catastrophic healthcare legislation for the elderly, Bush made clear he was stayingaway from that controversial topic, preferring instead to let ``thecongressional process hash this out.''   As for a possible future coup against Noriega, Bush said, ``Ihope I would never be reckless enough as a commander-in-chief tomake a blanket commitment to use of force without knowing the factsregarding some coup attempt.''   On the other hand, the president said, ``I wouldn't mind usingforce if it could be done in a prudent manner. So, in other words,I'm not ruling out the use of force for all time.''   Bush said, ``I am not going to give carte blanche support to anoperation, particularly when they don't ask for this support. And Ihave to reserve that right. I have at stake the lives of Americankids and I am not going to easily thrust them into a battle unlessI feel comfortable with it and unless those general officers inwhom I have total confidence feel comfortable.''   He rejected the idea of Noriega giving up power in return fordismissal of drug-trafficking charges in the United States, apossibility that a reporter suggested had been raised with thepresident. ``It would send an impossible signal in this fightagainst drugs,'' Bush said.   While defending his handling of the coup attempt, Bush said theadministration was reviewing procedures to see ``if we can't do itbetter.''   In Miami, Adela Bonilla de Giroldi, widow of the coup leader,said the U.S. military's cautious attitude toward coup leaders hadstalled vital aid at a key moment. In particular, she said U.S.officials were slow to react when one of the plotters tried to usea telephone number that U.S. authorities had provided for use in anemergency.   Bush promised to look into her complaint. ``To the degree we canimprove our communications, fine,'' he said.   As a result of an internal review, the administration hasdecided that a crisis-management team will be automaticallyconvened in the White House situation room in future emergencies, asenior official said.   Representatives of such agencies as the Pentagon, CIA and StateDepartment will be summoned to coordinate the flow of information,the official said, insisting on anonymity.   Hinting that he may seek congressional approval for greaterauthority in dealing with situations like the coup in Panama, Bushsaid, ``I want as broad a power as possible and I think under theConstitution the president has it.''   Although some members of his administration have faulted the waythe coup was handled, Bush insisted there was no second-guessingand ``all of them are singing from the same sheet of music.''   He said of his staff, ``they all did a good job.''</TEXT></DOC>
