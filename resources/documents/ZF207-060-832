 As a result, unlessAshton-Tate totally misses all targets, they will still keep the lead anddBASE clones will follow.andP;  For example, Clipper and FoxBASE+ will be moresuccessful in 1989 than they were in the past.andP;  We are seeing the samephenomenon in the microcomputer world as we've seen in the mainframe world.andO;An established pool of application software has its inertia to be converted.andO;&quot;Conversion is like changing a tire on a moving car&quot; in the mainframe as wellas in the departmental and microcomputer world.andM;Another DBMS that will be quite successful is Paradox.andP;  QBE (Query ByExample) is reincarnated in Paradox.andP;  User-friendly, which was an oxymoron,has, so far, moved closer to being somewhat user-friendly.andP;  Otherwise, weseem to be looking after system-friendly users instead of providinguser-friendly systems.andP;  But we are moving toward providing ease of use in themicrocomputer-based DBMS world.andP;  Paradox will be one of the products to watchfor in the 90s.andM;SQL (Structured Query Language) will be mandatory in some flavor.andO;SQL-interface, SQL-support, SQL-native, and SQL-bridge will be variousphrases used in marketing micro-based DBMS products.andP;  OS/2 Extended Edition,with its Data Base Manager, Communications Manager and Presentation Manager,will be reasonably successful.andP;  It is just too expensive to buy PS/2s withits heavy memory requirements!andP;  The software price is not low either!andP;  PS/2shaven't been that successful and, as a result, OS/2 Extended Edition will notbe overwhelmingly successful.andP;  The popular machine of 1989 will be PC-AT80286s with the old bus and, of course, the clones!andM;Other DBMSs to watch out for will be PC FOCUS, PC ORACLE, Micro Ingres, andInformix/SQL.andP;  We still don't know what's blooming in Lotus land!andP;  Blueprintseems to be ambitious.andP;  Lotus has to deliver its 1-2-3 release 3 beforetrying to conquer the unknown Database land.andM;SQL engine, a la Sybase, Gupta Technologies, and Novell, will be successfulonly in Fortune 100 organizations.andP;  These products are going to flourish inthe early 90s--not before that.andP;  Mainframe-micro connection is still a lot oftalk and little implementation!andP;  People still want to have their ownmachines--even if small--it is theirs.andP;  Just like everyone believes incar-pooling, how many really implement it?andP;  Computer usage is no different.andM;Craig BurtonandM;Executive Vice-PresidentandM;Novell Software GroupandM;With local area networks providing the basis for many enterprise-widesystems, microcomputer database management will become more important thanever.andM;Current workstation products have taken tremendous strides forward in areassuch as record locking and transaction tracking, which provides greaterassurance of data integrity.andM;In some cases, vendors have successfully moved beyond the limitations ofworkstation-oriented applications to the development of LAN database servers.andO;By centralizing the disk-intensive operation of a multiuser LAN database,these products are able to boost database performance, reduce networktraffic, and further enhance shared database functions.andM;But database products are just now beginning to expicit the distributedplatform provided by the LAN.andM;At the next level, LAN databases will increase their ability to draw datatransparently from multiple computing environments.andP;  1989 will herald newtools for the development of database products that span the multi-vendorenvironment.andM;Database engine products will be prevalent in 1989, and will gain greaterabilities to link heterogeneous hardware environments.andP;  For example, aNetWare LAN connecting IBM PC and PS/2 workstations, OS/2 workstations andMacintoshes will be able to query database servers that have access to theIBM mainframe and VAX.andM;The result of these products will be increased productivity for microcomputerusers on the LAN.andP;  Network databases will not only provide more information,but will be able to issue this information on a more strategic level than waspreviously possible.andM;Previously, computer technology was primarily useful for the accomplishmentof straightforward tasks.andP;  But during the coming year the LAN will movebeyond this current function to provide users with real-world intelligence.andO;Database products will encompass new levels of organized information--datathat has not only been collected and delivered, but also analyzed, evaluated,and distributed to the appropriate groups.andM;This transformation of raw data into finished, polished analytical tools willassist users in advancing to the next level of microcomputer use.andM;Distributed LAN applications will couple database products, which provideinformation, with communications products, which will act as the LAN datavehicle, for the purpose of sharing real-world intelligence on anenterprise-wide basis.andM;In the year to come, the industry will provide much more than technologicalenhancements for personal computer database products.andP;  The most significantadvances will be the ability to provide new answers to the question, &quot;Whatcan you do with a LAN?&quot;andM;Cheryl CurridandM;Manager of Department ComputerandM;ServicesandM;Coca-Cola FoodsandM;1989 might just be a year where we see both &quot;evolution&quot; as well as&quot;revolution&quot; in the database arena.andP;  Clearly the database management system(DBMS) category is rumbling, and the users are getting restless.andP;  The needfor more effective management of data is being spawned, in part, by theflattening and downsizing of corporate America.andP;  This, coupled withmanagement's increased span of control, creates new demands to turn data intoinformation--and to do it quickly.andM;The technical climate is nearly right.andP;  The coming of upscale hardwareplatforms, such as the 386-based workstations, network connectivity, and thelike give rise to better opportunities for managing large amounts of data.andO;And, if the next generation operating systems take hold, namely OS/2, we'llbegin to see an environment prime for innovation.andM;For the &quot;evolution&quot; we'll see products introduced that refine and enhance thestate of the art, but don't necessarily change the way we approach databases.andO;The evolving products will provide us with more powerful tools and morehorsepower, but we'll still need fairly well trained people to make the bestuse of them.andP;  The skilled and specifically knowledgeable informationengineers will seize newly found power and make the best of it.andP;  Others willcontinue to sit on the sidelines waiting for the next set of revolutionarydata managers.andM;No doubt some &quot;revolutionary&quot; products are on the horizon, and we'll probablybegin to see them emerge during mid to late 1989 or early 1990.andP;  By then,we'll have resolved the operating system dilemmas and, hopefully, be spendingmore time implementing the new standards than complaining about them.andP;  We'llprobably be installing lots more RAM in each work station.andP;  Then, we'll beconverting over to OS/2 and a more graphical user interface.andM;All in all, 1989 is likely to be an interesting year for the DBMS category.andO;At first it might seem like more smoke than fire.andP;  But substantive changesare at the end of this tunnel, and we're about to see the first signs oflight.andM;Wayne EricksonandM;Founder and ChairmanandM;MicrorimandM;Last year I predicted more OS/2 offerings, increased support for SQL, andgreater importance for networking and LANs.andP;  All these were good predictions.andO;In hindsight, I would keep those 1988 predictions intact for next year.andM;In looking at the DBMS industry in general, however, 1988 can be classifiedas a year where expectations exceeded deliverables.andP;  New products wereannounced with great fanfare but delivery dates for those products seemed toalways be slipping.andP;  And after some of them shipped, they probably shouldhave slipped even more.andM;I predict that 1989 will be the year when development capabilities finallybegin to be more important than marketing and sales hype.andP;  The customer isgetting fed up with announcements and wants to see actual deliveries of newand improved products that can really increase productivity.andP;  This presentsgreat opportunities for those companies that have proven developmentorganizations that really deliver.andP;  The future belongs to those that candeliver the technology--not the ones that announce it and fail to deliver.andM;Richard FinkelsteinandM;President, Performance ComputingandM;Contributing Editor,andM;Data Based AdvisorandM;In 1989 we'll see an explosion in local area networks and SQL databaseservers.andP;  File server technology will become a thing of the past.andP;  IBM willannounce a database server strategy for OS/2 Extended Edition in early 1989,and it will surge in popularity especially in the corporate world.andO;Microsoft's SQL Server will also continue to make strong gains.andP;  Otherdatabase servers, such as SQLBase, XDB and Netware SQL, will challenge IBMand Microsoft and carve out their own niches.andM;Borland, DataEase, Microsoft and Lotus will all come out with highproductivity application development tools based upon Windows andPresentation Manager.andP;  These tools and others like them will place the sealof approval on Presentation Manager and make OS/2 a major operating systemplatform.andP;  Major losers in this marketplace will be Ashton-Tate and Oracle,which have let their technology fall behind.andP;  End users and applicationdevelopers will leave these vendors for new, advanced, object oriented toolsand faster and more reliable database engines.andM;Connectivity between micros and mainframes will become more of a reality ascompanies such as Relational Technology, Sybase, Must Software, and GuptaTechnologies press on with their cooperative processing and distributeddatabase strategies.andP;  Distributed database servers, such as the one offeredby VIA Systems, will gain in prominence as organizations seek to shareinformation between database servers.andM;R.andP;  Russell FreelandandM;President, Synergy Corp.andM;Contributing Editor,andM;Data Based AdvisorandM;I look into my crystal ball, gazing deeply, deeply...aha!andP;  I see something!andO;Bill Gates will get married in 1989...to Phillippe Kahn!andP;  Whoops...musta hadit set to the Jeanne Dixon channel.andP;  Hold on...andless;staticsoundsandgt;...andless;smackandgt;...Ah, there, that's better.andP;  Now I see dBASE compilers (oris that &quot;Dbase&quot;?...it's pretty foggy).andP;  Wow, scads of dBASE compilers, andthey're really compilers.andP;  Incremental, optimizing compilers....andP;  Oh, I'mgetting a psychic flash.andP;  I feel the need for speed!andM;Seriously, Force III was a noble concept, and although the product didn'tquite make prime time (at least as of this writing), the idea won't go away.andO;The ante in the dBASE compiler arena just went up with the announcement ofthe Professional Compiler from Ashton-Tate.andP;  In 1989, we should see thelanguage expand exponentially, with open-architecture language features thatallow us to redefine features of the language--not just user definedfunctions, but user defined commands.andP;  This will create frighteningtech-support nightmares, but it's worth it!andP;  With Ashton-Tate's resources andApex's ingenuity, the Professional Compiler will become a reality.andP;  Whetherit works well or not is almost immaterial--the cloners will have specs tobeat, and I'm sure they will.andP;  No matter what happens, we'll end up with realcompilers in 1989, and then we'll see some superior &quot;packaged&quot; software fordBASE.andM;1989 should also see a lot of hubbub over SQL, both positive and negative.andO;The line between those of us who like it and those of us who don't willbecome more well-defined, but the SQL server technology will entice many ofus across the line sooner or later.andP;  Learn it now, or learn it later.andP;  Isuggest C.J.andP;  Date's book, A Guide to the SQL Standard, published byAddison-Wesley.andP;  It's short and sweet, written for programmers (who have anextremely short attention span, as we all know).andM;Ashton-Tate's alliance with DEC should also move the dBASE language intoanother league, then we'll have the mini programmers moaning about how slowSET FILTER TO is...At least we'll have the option of buying a VAX instead ofoptimizing the code...Now, when the mini versions of Lotus and WordPerfecthit the streets, I won't have any excuse for sticking to micros...The crystalball shows me many, many cans.andP;  What's that?andP;  They're full of--ah, it'sworms! And then there are bottles of bugs, but they're labeled &quot;Anomalies,&quot;and they're set right next to cartons labeled &quot;Work-arounds...sorta.&quot;andP;  I seea lot of fingers pointing at the other guy...I get stuck at this point with aflashing cursor--where's the reset switch on this thing?andM;Okay, rebooting...Now I see scads of embarrassing benchmarks between SQLimplementations.andP;  I see Fox software getting too big to be the favoredunderdog...I see users accidentally deleting the tons of files with crypticextensions in their dBASE IV directories...Hold on, fast forward must be heresomewhere.andP;  Expanded memory problems are rampant...leftover temporary workfiles and lost clusters...lawsuits and late shipments...andP;  Well, even with thenew developments, 1989 looks a lot like 1988, folks.andP;  Only more so.andM;David L. GilmourandM;General ManagerandM;Lotus Development Corp.andM;Last year, everyone was predicting that the major trend in 1988 would be theadoption of SQL by PC end users.andP;  In 1989, there will be a revelation thatend users don't care about SQL because it was never designed with them inmind.andP;  What users do care about are the many aspects of connectivity thatvendor standardization on SQL addresses.andM;1989 will mark the beginning of a transition to OS/2 and PresentationManager.andP;  The availability of easy to use, graphical database tools forPresentation Manager will be a much-needed catalyst in buffering PC usersfrom the complexities of SQL.andM;We'll also see a flurry of vendor competition in database back-ends, as anumber of new servers for LANs join existing mainframe, minicomputer and PCDBMSs.andP;  This will mean that users will be further confronted by theunenviable challenge of finding the necessary data and knowing the nuances ofthat particular DBMS.andP;  The key to bringing the power of database managementdown to the end user will be in providing tools that reconcile thedisparities between multiple data sources.andM;Finally, computing organizations will place a high priority in 1989 on theco-existence of tried and true applications like 1-2-3 with new databaseapplications.andP;  But it won't be until critical Presentation Managerapplications are available that customers will be spurred to make the move tothe new systems software.andM;George F. Goley, IVandM;Founder, Micro Endeavors, Inc.andM;Contributing Editor,andM;Data Based AdvisorandM;This year will herald the coming of age of the &quot;dBASE&quot; language.andP;  No longerrelegated to use in single-user applications running on IBM-compatiblemicrocomputers, the dBASE language will continue to find its way onto anexploding number of networked DOS PCs (WordTech Diamond Release, dBASE IV,FoxBASE+, Clipper, and others), Macintosh PCs (FoxBASE+/Mac), VAX minis(Recital and dBASE), UNIX/XENIX (SCO FoxBASE+), IBM mainframes(Oracle/Quicksilver), and OS/2 PCs (dBASE IV, FoxBASE+, and others).andP;  As aresult, dBASE language developers can look forward to a year filled with newmarkets and new opportunities.andM;The dBASE add-on market will experience a strong recovery as dBASE IV'sweaknesses are identified by users, and capitalized on by add-on vendors.andO;Rather than adding entirely new features, however, these products will&quot;replace&quot; existing features in dBASE IV.andM;By the end of the year, we'll be able to choose from among at least fivedifferent microcomputer-related &quot;file server&quot; products.andP;  The availability ofthese products will make PC-based networks even more popular fortransaction-oriented database management applications.andP;  The introduction offile server technology will also create a growing demand for sophisticatedfront ends for the SQL language.andM;We've seen the end of the $99 dBASE compilers.andP;  dBASE IV sets thetechnological ante too high for these low-cost products to compete.andM;The dBASE language will standardize of its own accord around the nowmonolithic syntax contained in dBASE IV.andP;  As a result, competition amongdBASE language vendors Ashton-Tate, Fox Software, WordTech, and Nantucket,will center on performance and user interface concerns rather than onlanguage extensions.andM;With the advent of FoxBASE+/Mac, and Novell Netware 2.15, more and more PCnetworks will include both Macintosh and IBM-compatible work stationssimultaneously accessing data in the same DBF files.andP;  This trend will beenhanced when IBM's Presentation Manager appears, allowing for a standarduser interface across both hardware platforms.andM;Adam GreenandM;dBASE Speaker and WriterandM;Contributing Editor,andM;Data Based AdvisorandM;The current implementation of dBASE IV will be very popular with dBASE IIIPLUS users, but will not impress many dBASE compatible users.andP;  By the fall of1989 the dBASE IV language will be established as the next standard fordBASE.andP;  The only question is which implementation of that language?andM;By 1990 Recital, FoxBASE+/Mac, Oracle, Quicksilver, and dBXL will have suchestablished leads in their respective markets that it will be too late forAshton-Tate to regain control over the dBASE language.andM;Umang GuptaandM;FounderandM;Gupta Technologies, Inc.andM;I see the biggest decision for PC users next year as being whether to go toOS/2 or stay with PC-DOS for a while longer.andP;  And I suspect more users aregoing to stay with PC-DOS than move to OS/2.andM;Why?andP;  An AT compatible machine equipped for DOS costs about $2,200.andP;  Amachine fully equipped for OS/2 Presentation Manager, including 4M memory, aVGA or EGA monitor, and a 386 processor is at least $8,000.andP;  Thisdifferential is stunning when you pay it twice--once for home and once forthe office.andP;  As software developers, we often have no choice but to buy themore expensive machines.andP;  However, I expect that most corporate managers willextend the life of their AT class machines and introduce 386s gradually overthe next few years.andM;John L. HawkinsandM;President, HawkTek Corp.andM;Contributing Editor,andM;Data Based AdvisorandM;In addition to Oracle, another major software company will issue a newdBASE-language compatible database manager.andM;A second-string database product will embrace dBASE compatibility in anattempt to survive.andM;If pushed to choose, dBASE users will prefer language compatibility over datafile compatibility.andM;A functional version of dBASE IV will be released by Ashton-Tate.andM;SQL may become popular, especially among those who have not experienced dBASEIV.andM;The dBASE Professional Compiler will be appear later and run slower thanpromised; but when it does appear, dBASE IV will look even worse.andM;FoxBASE+ will continue to be the dBASE version of choice, especially when itadds Clipper-like UDFs and EXE output.andM;Fox will finally allow hassle-free, no-extra-charge creation of unlimited,royalty-free runtimes through a special installation procedure.andM;Emerald Bay/Eagle will look more and more like what dBASE IV should havebeen.andM;Nantucket will survive, or be purchased, or not.andM;Basil HosmerandM;Programmer/PhilosopherandM;WallsoftandM;1989.andP;  Has a kind of science-fiction flavor, doesn't it?andP;  I'm sure there wassome important historical event in Star Trek that happened in 1989--youremember, Captain, the fiasco with the orbiting hydrogen cannons.andP;  Something.andM;The fun thing about 1989 is that by the middle of the year, we'll already beswimming in 90s mania, the beginning of the Age O'Whatever it turns out tobe.andP;  Of course, whatever cool stuff happens in the 90s will be coming intofocus next year.andP;  So, let's take a look, shall we?andM;MTV, already atrocious, will get worse.andP;  On the other hand, the global net ofcable and satellite TV, along with the fact that your grandmother could shoota great video if you gave her a camcorder, means that there'll be lots ofinteresting stuff on the tube.andP;  Commercials will continue to be moreentertaining than ever before.andM;Not only that...With pop culture getting ever more immersed in computers,lots of what we watch in '89 will involve stuff we do at work.andM;Remember the part in RoboCop where the guy wakes up as a cyborg, and thereadout in front of his eyes says &quot;Loading COMMAND.COM&quot;? Well, that's justthe beginning--in 1989, trash like that Wrigley's Spearmint Gum commercial(&quot;How does one compute...'pure chewing satisfaction'?&quot;) will be replaced byfunny ads that we'll repeat lines from, along with at least one showfeaturing a young, Yuppie programmer lookin' for love.andP;  Frightening, huh?andM;As far as the industry, the only sure thing is that the press (and usprogrammer/philosophers) will keep overestimating the impact of everything.andO;Sure, I've got a mouse on my desk, but that's because I'm into this stuff.andO;And so are you.andP;  The guy behind the counter at Avis will keep going home atfive whether he's working with a modeless, object-oriented environment ornot.andP;  Here's a sure bet: by the end of 1989, a disgusting number of systemswritten in dBASE III PLUS will still be in use.andM;As usual, though, there'll be lots of cool, new stuff for us to play with.andO;And anyway, there's always the '89 baseball season to look forward to.andP;  TheMets are hungry.andP;  Stay tuned.andM;David KaplanandM;Product Manager, SQL ServerandM;MicrosoftandM;During 1989, OS/2 will emerge as an important market force for two primaryreasons: new graphical applications based on OS/2 Presentation Manager; andOS/2 based networking, built upon products like the Microsoft OS/2 LANManager and IBM LAN Server.andP;  These technologies will provide the systemssoftware foundation for a new generation of programs, called client/serverapplications.andP;  Client/server applications will combine the ease of use andgraphical interface benefits of PCs with network access to powerful multiuserservices, formerly available only on minis and mainframes.andP;  Many OS/2networks will also allow PC workstations running existing DOS applications tofully participate as clients, gaining access to electronic mail, powerfulshared database servers, connectivity with mainframe computers, and the like.andM;The client/server trend will have a dramatic effect on database computing,especially in the area of OS/2 database servers.andP;  The Ashton-Tate/MicrosoftSQL Server, for example, will make it possible to easily share data acrossnetworks among a wide variety of front-end client applications--includingpopular PC software like dBASE, Paradox and Excel, as well as accountingsystems and other programs.andP;  Many of these front-ends will offer users agraphical interface to make tasks such as queries, reporting and formscreation simpler and more intuitive.andP;  Multi-vendor client/server computingwill eventually replace the &quot;monolithic&quot; approach to database management,still common today, in which a given database engine only works withtightly-coupled front-end tools (typically provided only by the vendor of theengine itself).andM;In 1989 and the years beyond, transaction-oriented RDBMSs like SQL Serverwill enable PC networks to become the platform for more and moremission-critical applications, including many systems that had formerly beenconfined to minis and mainframes.andM;David MillerandM;President/CEOandM;WordTech SystemsandM;Local area network SQL database servers are going to become really hot.andO;dBASE IV with finally become a useful product about July, by which timeWordTech Systems, Fox Software and Nantucket will all have dBASE IVcompatible products that are four to 10 times faster than dBASE IV.andO;Ashton-Tate will begin exhibiting schizophrenia as rival internal groupsfight over conflicts between marketing their own Interbase SQL technology andthe Microsoft/Sybase SQL technology.andP;  Microsoft, Borland, and Lotus will jumpinto the database market, and at least one of them will fail miserably.andM;Richard NeyandM;Director of MarketingandM;Fox SoftwareandM;The popularity of the Macintosh seen in 1988 will continue through 1989.andP;  Asa result, PC-Mac connectivity will become an even greater consideration whendatabase software is evaluated.andP;  Concurrent data access -- the ability ofnetworked Macs and PCs to simultaneously access the same data file willbecome the feature that separates the multi-user database software winnersfrom the also-rans.andM;OS/2 will not overtake DOS in 1989 as the preferred operating system asoriginally expected in 1988.andP;  Rather, a slow orderly transition in OS/2 willoccur, with users waiting to see more OS/2 applications developed beforemaking the switch.andP;  OS/2's impact won't be seen or felt until 1990.andM;dBASE IV will be rolled out with great fanfare but to disappointing results.andO;Early reviews will indicate less than optimal execution speed, stability andimplementation of features.andP;  Serious users, disappointed with dBASE IV, willseek an alternative.andP;  dBASE IV's EXE compiler will be available in latesummer at the earliest, and not January as promised at the Ashton-TateDevelopers Conference.andM;The best implementation of SQL and dBASE will not involve setting SQL on andoff.andP;  Rather, seamless integration of dBASE and SQL with acting as a naturalextension of dBASE will prove a far superior implementation.andP;  PC users willbe shocked at the performance of manay SQL products when used in a singleworkstation environment.andM;Greater demand for compatibility among platforms will occur as mixedplatforms become more prevalent.andM;Steve PerryandM;CEOandM;Mainframe Micros/RevelationandM;TechnologiesandM;1989 will be the year that people begin asking more serious questions abouttheir database environments.andP;  For example, most developers will be asking ifa database offers a central, active data dictionary.andP;  A database without acentral, active data dictionary cannot begin to handle the requirements ofthe &quot;heavy duty&quot; applications that are now beginning to move down from themainframe to the PC level.andM;Developers are also going to be asking questions on such features as&quot;environmental bonding.&quot;andP;  Environmental bonding allows your database toattach other filing systems, whether they be Revelation, dBASE, Lotus, orAutoCad, and to read and write from them as if they were their own.andP;  Thisallows organizations to maintain the large investments they have made inexisting applications and yet have the best tools at their disposal.andM;1989 will undoubtedly be the year people begin to question current databasemarket leaders and wonder whether the features and power they offer aresufficient for the new breed of high end applications that are finding theirway to the PC.andM;Wayne Ratliff, Creator of dBASEandM;PresidentandM;Ratliff Software Production, Inc.andM;1.andP;  Ashton-Tate will continue to lose market share.andP;  Fox Software will be thelargest gainer of that share.andM;2.andP;  There is a significant probability that dBASE IV will be recalled byAshton-Tate because of performance and bug problems and they will beginselling dBASE III PLUS again.andP;  (It is my understanding that dBASE III PLUS isnot being shipped by Ashton-Tate at this time.)andP;  If the recall is not done,there will be a flurry of updates to dBASE IV.andM;3.andP;  The Microsoft Windows market will shrink due to Presentation Manager.andM;4.andP;  OS/2 adoption will be slower than expected primarily due to the cost ofmemory chips and also due to the reluctance of people to move away from DOS,especially since developers are getting better and better at using DOS andbecause the architecture of the 80386 offers enough DOS compatiblealternatives.andM;5.andP;  SQL will become less of a buzzword in 1989.andP;  Once end users see what SQLis really like, they'll insist upon &quot;front ends&quot; to insulate themselves fromSQL.andM;6.andP;  Software will be judged more for its ability to work well on a networkthan single user systems for the first time (especially database managementsystems.andP;  Networks will be the generation change (a la 8-bit to 16-bit) thatwas falsely predicted for 32-bit computer two years ago but its impact willbe evenly spread over several years.andM;7.andP;  Micro-mainframe connectivity will shrink slightly in importance.andO;Micro-mainframe linkages will migrate slowly to LANs.andP;  Macintosh-to-PCnetworks will be a very hot issue and much in demand.andP;  Apple will be a morewilling connector than IBM.andM;8.andP;  The competition in the database management system market will be the mosthotly contested, much as was the case for &quot;calcs&quot; in '83 and '84.andP;  There willprobably be one or more mergers of DBMS vendors that could alter the &quot;BIG 3COMPANIES&quot; list.andM;9.andP;  1989 will be the year of the &quot;true x.&quot;andP;  That is, products will becompared to a true something or other.andP;  Software vendors will say that theirproduct is a true x and that all the competitors are not true implementationsof that feature, as if there were some agreed-upon definition for thefeatures.andP;  The press will be the biggest victim and the primary spreaders ofthe phenomenon in a repeat performance of the artificial intelligence crazeof 1987 and the SQL craze of 1988.andP;  Some leading true contenders are: Is it atrue client server implementation?andP;  Is it a truly relational database model?andO;Is it a true NETBIOS compatible network?andP;  Is it a true Macintosh userinterface?andM;Richard L. SchwartzandM;Vice President, Database TechnologyandM;Borland InternationalandM;1989 should be an excellent year for PC users.andP;  Two trends will start toconverge: better user interfaces and more connectivity between users.andO;Innovation in database management will lead the charge as data managementtools begin to take their place as the foundation in many application areas.andM;Visual metaphors for user interaction and input will become increasinglypredominant.andP;  I believe this will be true both for new graphical userinterface environments and for the DOS character-based world.andP;  As these newmetaphors are properly executed, it will mean more to the user than simplyhaving pull-down menus and dialog boxes.andP;  Directly manipulating objectsrather than describing an effect will open up new styles of database ad hocuse and application construction.andM;At the same time, an important bridge will be forged between corporatetransaction-oriented data stored on a LAN or outside SQL servers and theworld of less-structured PC information management.andP;  Without losing thebenefits that single and multiuser data systems offer the PC user, the worldof more traditional transaction processing should become more accessible.andO;The challenge for software vendors in 1989 is to accomplish this withoutlosing sight of the rich set of capabilities that PC database productspresent today.andP;  Adding transparent access to outside data from within thecurrent environment will begin to allow global workgroup informationmanagement by both end users and information processing professionals.andM;Steve StraleyandM;Clipper WriterandM;1988 was the calm before the storm.andP;  For, as it was with dBASE II and dBASEIII, so will it be with dBASE IV in 1989.andP;  Ashton-Tate will define the needand the direction by embracing corporate America.andP;  With this in motion,FoxBASE+ and Clipper will take that definition -- will make it work bigger,better, faster.andM;The only difference 1989 will offer is bringing more people into theprogramming picture.andP;  With dBASE IV all people will have access to more toolsto aid in design and implementation.andP;  More people will become third partydevelopers.andM;The struggle wil be with the end user, in determining which of thosecompanies are dedicated to growth, power, and support.andP;  Fox's approach is toservice the programming community with practical and pragmatic answers, totake the dBASE IV approach and make it work even better in today'senvironment.andP;  Clipper's object-oriented approach will be revolutionary.andP;  Itwill give us more tools and more power in today's and tomorrow's environment.andO;Unless this new approach is seamless and upwardly compatible, the Clippership may sit drydock for some time.andP;  Emerald Bay will struggle in 1989 withit's own identity, to separate it from the rest of the market -- its maintask is to educate users on the concept of shared data.andP;  And the remainingplayers will struggle with the remaining market.andM;Old annoying habits remain.andP;  All companies will struggle to survive.andP;  The enduser will become more astute, less tolerant, willing to turn away fromestablished firms if they refuse to admit problems, correct mistakes,announce early ship dates, or provide the industry with hollow solutions andempty problems.andM;Karen WattersonandM;Educator, AuthorandM;Contributing Editor,andM;Data Based AdvisorandM;I don't expect any bombshells in 1989.andP;  I think we'll see a gradual migrationof database applications to OS/2 and database servers, and we'll see microDBMSs becoming more robust, with features like active data dictionaries andmechanisms for commit and rollback.andP;  Concurrently, a market will develop forconsultants who have experience both in the microcomputer and minicomputerDBMS arena to help provide server-based connectivity.andP;  In many organizations,old rivalries between micro types and DP types will be reopened.andM;I think we'll also see CASE tools being used more and more, both by microusers and in traditional DP shops.andP;  As micros become capable of tacklinglarger problems, micro users will appreciate both the front-end CASE toolsthat help them in systems analysis and design and the back-end applicationgenerators.andM;As developers become more comfortable with object-oriented programming andthe graphical interface, we'll also see them embracing hypertext to solvecertain types of text- and/or graphics-intensive problems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
