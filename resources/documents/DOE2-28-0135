The method requiresan appropriate smoother. Cross-validation is used to determine the appropriatesmoother. An alternative method is introduced to determine an appropriatelevel of smoothing that involves minimizing mean local variance. Meanlocal variance is a function of the size of a circular window. It isminimized for two pollutants in Ohio, New York, and Florida. The smootherobtained by cross-validation using Ohio's data is compared to that obtainedby minimizing mean local variance.</TEXT></DOC>
