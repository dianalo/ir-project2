Refined petroleum products also lost ground.   ``It was a volatile day,'' said Peter Beutel, an energy analystwith Elders Futures Inc.   Beutel said prices started out weak following reports thatproduction among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countrieshad been higher than expected during January and February.   But he said the market started to rally later in the sessionafter non-OPEC nations Mexico, Egypt and the Soviet Union announced5 percent cuts in their oil output.   Several non-OPEC nations had agreed at a London conference lastmonth to cut oil production in coordination with an earlierproduction pact between cartel members.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled 16 cents lowerat $18.56 a barrel, after rising as high as $18.88 a barrel at onepoint during Friday's session.   Traders said prices declined in a wave of technical selling afterthe WTI April contract failed to pierce the psychologicallyimportant $19-a-barrel level.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, theApril contract for wholesale home heating oil settled 1.07 centslower at 50.80 cents a gallon. April unleaded gasoline settled at51.53 cents, down 0.68 cent.</TEXT></DOC>
