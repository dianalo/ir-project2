Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the panel, openedthe meeting by reading a letter from Federal DepositInsurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman that warned: &quot;Itwould be imprudent and unwise for the Congress to go beyondOctober&quot; without providing the FDIC more money to deal withbank failures. A letter from Charles Bowsher, the head of theGeneral Accounting Office, predicted that &quot;the fund will bebillions of dollars in the red by the end of this year.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Indeed, the GAO, which is completing an audit of the FDIC,is expected to announce soon that the fund may already beinsolvent and the FDIC is keeping insolvent banks openbecause it doesn't have sufficient money to close them andpay off insured deposits. But FDIC officials assert that bytheir accounting methods, the fund has a positive, but small,balance.   Comprehensive banking legislation before the panel wouldadd $70 billion to the FDIC's borrowing authority, slightlyrestrict the scope of deposit insurance, give regulators newpowers to prevent banks from becoming insolvent, and allowbanks to expand nationwide and into new lines of business.The House Banking Committee already has passed a version ofthe sweeping bank-law overhaul proposal the administrationlaunched in February.   Sen. Riegle expressed the hope that the Senate panel wouldcomplete work on the bill before it starts its August recesstomorrow. But a number of senators said they would ratherfinish the bill in September and then send it to the fullSenate. As a result, the panel proceeded slowly and didn'tvote on any of the 324 amendments before it during aneight-hour session.   The panel spent most of the day discussing a series ofcompromises worked out by Mr. Riegle and the committee'sranking Republican, Sen. Jake Garn of Utah. Mr. Garnpredicted that the panel wouldn't complete work on the billuntil after its August recess, although at the end of theday, Sen. Riegle said he still hoped to finish during thenext two days.   The panel held a lengthy discussion of a proposal to allowbanks to affiliate with securities firms, a move that wouldrepeal the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. This is one of the mostsensitive issues of the bill because it pits the interests ofbig banks against the securities industry, both of which areheavy contributors to members of Congress.   The issues the panel must sort out are how to preventbanks from placing new burdens on the deposit insurance fundthrough securities activities and how to prevent banks fromgetting an unfair competitive advantage over securitiesfirms.</TEXT></DOC>
