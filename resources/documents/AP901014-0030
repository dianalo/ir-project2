(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The trial of a Jamaican immigrant oncharges he killed a Boston policeman during a drug raid has focusedon allegations that the slain officer's partners lied to get thewarrant that set up the raid.   The case has prompted questions about the validity of otherwarrants obtained by the drug squad and the general integrity ofpolice investigations.   The allegations against the officers also have been raised bysome who question the quality of recent Boston murderinvestigations, including the Charles Stuart murder case.   Police now believe Stuart killed his pregnant wife and thenwounded himself in October 1989, then later committed suicide whenthe story began unraveling. But they initially accepted Stuart'saccount that he and his wife were attacked by a black man and nameda man as a suspect.   Arguments and testimony in the murder trial of Albert Lewinbegan in this northwestern Massachusetts city Oct. 4, after thecase was moved from Boston because of extensive media coverage.   The case against Lewin, 34, stems from a drug raid Feb. 17,1988, when Detective Sherman Griffiths was killed by shots firedthrough an apartment door.   Suffolk County prosecutors claim Lewin, later found sitting inthe living room of another apartment, was the unseen gunman.   Three other people in the apartment where he was arrested havetestified against Lewin, and in exchange, prosecutors have droppedcharges pending against them.   Police have admitted making up an informant whose informationsupposedly was the basis of the search warrant used for the drugraid. And Lewin doesn't match the description of the drug dealerdescribed in the warrant.   The case has prompted questions about the validity of otherwarrants obtained by the drug squad and the general integrity ofpolice investigations.   ``The problem is that the law presumes that police officers aregoing to tell the truth. The conditions of the job create pressuresto not tell the truth and offers temptations to get away with it,''said David Rossman, director of Boston University's CriminalClinical Project.   ``It brings up the whole issue of the enormous discretion thatpolice and prosecutors have in the criminal justice system,'' saidMartin Rosenthal, managing attorney for Harvard Law School'sCriminal Justice Project.   Following the admission that police officers had lied, acommission was appointed to investigate the department. Changesimplemented included tightening up monitoring and a special classon constitutional rights, said spokeswoman Jill Reilly.   Defense attorney Max Stern maintains Lewin is the victim of a``desperate effort'' by police to cover up a botched investigation.   The state's case rests in part on the testimony of the threepeople, all related, in the apartment where Lewin was found. Theyidentify Lewin as the suspected drug dealer sought in the raid.   One of the three was initially charged with murder in Griffiths'death.   Controversy also developed over a fingerprint on the ammunitionclip of the murder weapon. Originally deemed useless by Bostonpolice, it was re-examined by the FBI this summer, using techniquesunavailable in 1988, and was identified as Lewin's.   The print was photographed and then destroyed in a subsequentchemical test. The defense challenged use of the print as evidence,because it couldn't be re-examined, but a judge ruled thephotograph could be used.   Detective Carlos A. Luna and Sgt. Hugo R. Amate are awaitingtrial on charges they lied under oath about an informant and filedfalse police reports in a cover-up attempt.   The affidavit filed by detectives to obtain the search warrantquoted an informant named John who said a 5-foot, 6-inch Hispanicdrug dealer was dealing cocaine from the apartment where Griffithswas killed. Lewin is 6-foot-2 and Jamaican.   The informant was never produced and Luna is accused ofattempting to concoct a story that the man died or couldn't befound. Amate is charged with being an accessory after the fact inthe alleged perjury.   The case against Lewin was thrown out by a Superior Court judge,but it was later reinstated by the Supreme Judicial Court,Massachusetts' highest court.   The justices called police conduct in the case ``contemptibleand disgusting,'' but added:   ``In order to express its outrage at the reprehensible policeconduct in this case, society need not punish itself by freeing aman who may be guilty of murder in the first degree and otherserious crimes.''</TEXT></DOC>
