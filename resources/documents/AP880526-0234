Sixteen Democrats and seven Republicans are backing a billintroduced by Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I. It would bar Sandamp;Lsfrom leaving the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. untilAug. 10, 1989 _ one year longer than a ban currently in effect.   Congress last summer included the initial moratorium inlegislation providing for a $10.8 billion industry-financedinfusion into FSLIC, which insures Sandamp;L deposits up to $100,000.   Because the insurance premium charged by FSLIC is roughly 2{times greater than the premium charged the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., legislators fear that thrifts eligible foradmission to the FDIC will leave FSLIC and become banks.   The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress,warned last week that the Sandamp;L fund may not have enough money comingin to take care of the roughly 500 Sandamp;Ls listed as insolvent.   ``Any flight of (healthy) institutions whose insurance premiumshelp pay the bills would be a further blow to an already weakenedfund,'' St Germain said in a statement.   St Germain introduced the legislation after receiving a letterWednesday from the top federal regulator of savings institutions,Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, who supportsextending the moratorium.   Wall said the bank board did not know how many Sandamp;Ls would leavethe fund if they could, but, he said, ``The most important value inthis equation at the moment is perception _ the perception thatwithout the moratorium there may be a major exodus from FSLIC.''   Mark Clark, senior vice president of the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions, the largest trade group in the industry, saidextending the moratorium is unfair to savings institutions andbreaks the agreement Congress made with the industry last year.   ``We don't advocate mass exodus. All we're saying is there oughtto be free choice,'' Clark said.</TEXT></DOC>
