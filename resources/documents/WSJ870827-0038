However, many analysts and traders remain skeptical that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries can ensure production discipline while its two largest producers -- Saudi Arabia and Iran -- remain at odds.    Following a three-week decline in oil prices, OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria on Tuesday called a series of meetings, starting Sept. 7, to halt above-quota production by some OPEC members.    And yesterday, according to a newspaper in Caracas, Venezuela, that country's oil minister, Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, called on OPEC members to maintain their production quotas to support prices.    Announcement of the meetings followed oil industry reports that OPEC's production for this month is expected to reach 19.7 million barrels a day, or 3.1 million barrels more than its self-imposed quota of 16.6 million barrels.    &quot;OPEC is clearly in a 'let's-talk-up-the-market mode,'&quot; said Steve H. Hanke, chief economist at Friedberg Commodity Management Inc. in Toronto.    As a result, many traders who had opened short, or selling, positions, bought them back on the chance that OPEC would be able to rein in production, brokers and analysts said.    &quot;What we saw was short covering and not fresh buying, and that shows the market is somewhat skeptical&quot; of the OPEC announcement, said Stephen Piasio, vice president of the international energy department at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. in New York.    Still, in one of the largest one-day price rises this year, crude oil for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange soared 82 cents a barrel to $19.46. The contract had risen to a session high of $19.50. Heating oil and gasoline contract prices also posted strong advances.    On the spot, or noncontract, market, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose 80 cents a barrel to $19.45. And the spot price of North Sea Brent, a European benchmark crude, rose 35 cents, to $18.05 a barrel in late trading.    Some market specialists suggested that any OPEC ministerial meeting is likely to have little practical effect on restraining production because such hastily called OPEC meetings historically have had little long-term success.    And analysts said the Saudis, who typically have cut output in the past to offset excess production by other members, aren't likely to repeat such a maneuver this time around.    Citing an unusual Saudi news conference Tuesday denouncing Iran for its role in riots near Mecca in late July, Mr. Hanke said the Saudis &quot;have publicly pointed their finger&quot; at the Iranians. It is &quot;extremely unlikely they'll be accommodative&quot; to them, he said.    The Saudi-Iranian fractiousness contrasts with the close cooperation that the two nations displayed in forging OPEC's current production and pricing accord.    Yesterday's sharp rally also represented a typical reaction in the market to the sustained price decline of the past three weeks, analysts and traders said.    Before yesterday, oil prices plunged 12 of the past 16 sessions, tumbling about $4, or 18%.    &quot;The market had been too top heavy and one-sided,&quot; said John O'Dea, manager of international energy futures at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.    And Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc. in New York said the market &quot;has been very oversold, and the OPEC announcement made people reconsider how short they wanted to be.&quot;    The rally in the U.S. spot and futures markets also was partly triggered by technical factors, analysts said. For instance, because prices for West Texas Intermediate have been weaker compared with some foreign crude oil blends, some traders yesterday bought the U.S. blend and sold foreign blends, hoping to profit on the difference in prices.    Meanwhile, prices could remain propped until OPEC meets next month before falling further, many analysts said.    &quot;For the moment, OPEC has managed to delay the downward price move,&quot; Mr. Piasio said. &quot;But the fundamentals are still negative.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
