It could store only about 100 pages of images, but it was seen as a big step toward the truly &quot;paperless&quot; office.    Now, almost four years later, a score of companies -- from Eastman Kodak Co. and Bell andamp; Howell Corp. to fledglings FileNet Corp. and LaserData Inc. -- are attempting to build a new business around the &quot;document-image-processing&quot; technology Wang introduced.    New systems are integrating changes in the way computers capture images with advances that enable computers to store more data, display sharper images and create better copies. The systems aren't just replacing &quot;old forms of storing paper but are radically changing how paper is handled in the workplace,&quot; says Rich Edwards, a technology analyst with Robertson, Colman andamp; Stephens in San Francisco.    The document-image-processing system of today is really a patchwork of many technology elements. It consists of a &quot;document entry station&quot; where a scanner takes an electronic picture of the document, holds it until it can be indexed and then transmits it for storage on an optical disk. A high-power laser beam then etches the information on the disk, in the form of microscopic pits, to be read later by a low-power laser. A laser printer reproduces the document almost exactly like the original.    THE OPTICAL DISK is the centerpiece of the system. Without the ability of the disk to store large quantities of information -- a 5 1/4-inch optical disk, for instance, stores 20 times more information than the same-sized magnetic disk -- &quot;the system wouldn't be cost-effective,&quot; says Shelley D. Bakst, a technology analyst with International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. Larger systems use a 12-inch optical disk, which costs about $400 and can store about 50,000 pages of information, Ms. Bakst says.    Compared to microfilm images, which are often unclear, the images are &quot;exceptionally sharp,&quot; says Avi Bender of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which stores data from waste-processing companies on a personal-computer-based system.    Advances in the computer's ability to &quot;read&quot; and in the technology to help transmit data have given a new dimension to the systems, says Ed Rothchild, a San Francisco-based industry analyst. Electronic readers, which recognize the characteristics of a letter, allow users to search a disk by key words contained in the text. And, Mr. Rothchild adds, improvements in local area networks make it possible to send large quantities of data to a number of users simultaneously.    ADDS PETER BESEN, a founder of LaserData Inc. of Lowell, Mass.: &quot;Laser printers make copies look almost as good as the original. Instead of getting back just text, you can retrieve almost the same document you stored.&quot; For users, that should be a blessing. Instead of warehousing mountains of engineering drawings and architectural designs on paper, they can reduce them to computer code and store them on optical disks.    As with all new systems, there are problems. The optical disk the systems use can't be erased and re-recorded, and &quot;until we begin to use erasable disks, we won't know the limits of the technology,&quot; says Mr. Rothchild, the consultant. Others say that current data transmission methods restrict the speed at which documents can be sent to other users.    Still, the new systems are slowly gaining acceptance. This year, corporations and government agencies will purchase 250 systems with a total value of $70 million, according to International Data Corp., the industry research group. By 1991, sales will exceed $1 billion, the group predicts.    THE U.S. PATENT and Trademark Office plans to install a system that will help convert all its patent records into computer code for storage. Union Bank (Los Angeles) is handling its installment loan and retirement plan operations through a system designed by FileNet, of Costa Mesa, Calif. The FileNet system stores the documents and, according to Leon White, a Union Bank executive, &quot;makes them available to everyone simultaneously.&quot; Mr. White says that the $150,000 system, which connects with the bank's mainframe computer, will gradually replace both its paper and microfilm records.    There are systems for personal-computer users as well. LaserData makes a smaller $50,000 version that works with personal computers. Instead of storing patient data on microfilm, the Maine Medical Center in Portland stores all its in-patient records on a recently purchased LaserData system. The personal computer scans the medical records, then indexes and stores the data on 12-inch optical disks. Doctors and medical technicians can then call up patients' records, add data and print out the stored material on laser printers.    Hospitals, banks, brokerage houses and government agencies will be among the major users of these systems, industry analysts predict. But they warn that sales won't soar overnight. &quot;Large corporations have already made major investments in microfilm storage and data-processing systems. They're not going to replace these systems in a hurry,&quot; says Robert Kalthoff, an industry consultant in Cincinnati. And, he adds, many corporate data managers won't adopt the new technology unless they can integrate it into systems they already have; &quot;they're tired of trying to manage islands of technology that keep popping up.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
