Attorney Yoram Sheftel accused people in the department ofconcealing the evidence, which he said includes testimonycontradicting court rulings Demjanjuk was responsible for gassing todeath hundreds of thousands of Jews in World War II.   Demjanjuk, 69, a retired auto worker from a Cleveland suburb, wasfound guilty by an Israeli court in April 1988 of crimes againsthumanity and crimes against the Jewish people and sentenced to death.   His appeal was scheduled to be heard starting Nov. 1. In courtpetitions, Sheftel asked for a delay of at least six months, citingdocuments he said were found in a garbage bin at the JusticeDepartment's Office of Special Investigations. The office probessuspected Nazi war criminals.   The Israeli attorney accused the office of ``concealing importantevidence on the one hand and falsifying other evidence'' inproceedings that stripped Demjanjuk of U.S. citizenship in 1981,paving the way for his extradition to Israel five years later.   There was no comment from the office. A spokesman in Washingtondid not immediately return a phone call from The Associated Press.   Demjanjuk's trial was Israel's first of an accused war criminalin 25 years.   Witnesses identified him as a sadistic guard known as ``Ivan theTerrible'' who switched on the gas chambers at the Treblinka deathcamp in Nazi-occupied Poland, where 850,000 Jews perished between1942 and 1943.   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk claimed to be a victim of mistakenidentity.   Sheftel said in a telephone interview that the documents foundwere ``of decisive importance to the results of the appellant'strial'' because they challenge important testimony identifyingDemjanjuk as Ivan.   He said one document shows that a key witness, former Nazi prisonguard Otto Horn, failed to identify Demjanjuk in a photo lineup.During the trial, the court was told Horn did identify him.   Another document would appear to challenge whether a witness at a1980 trial to strip Demjanjuk of U.S. citizenship recognizedDemjanjuk in a photo from a Nazi identification card, the attorneysaid. The card was a key piece of evidence in the trial.</TEXT></DOC>
