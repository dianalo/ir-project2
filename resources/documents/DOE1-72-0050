This can be done by equating the simulator irradiance to thesolar irradiance when they both cause an equal rise in plate temperatureabove ambient or stagnation under constant conditions. Furthermore, forglass-covered collectors, a pyranometer will read a correct effectiveirradiance from a simulator, even if based on incandescent lamps.</TEXT></DOC>
