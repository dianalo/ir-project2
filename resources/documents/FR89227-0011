Background </ITAG>Authorization Process Section 3006 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926 <T3>et. seq., </T3>allows EPA to authorize State hazardous waste managementprograms to operate in the states in lieu of the Federal hazardous wasteprogram. This is done when a state submits to EPA a request for authorizationdemonstrating that the state program is equivalent to the Federal program.In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendmentsof 1984 (Pub. L. 98-616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter referred to as ``HSWA'')allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalentinstead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority.States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' forthe HSWA requirements under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g),and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary whenever Federalor State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certainother changes occur. This is because states with final Authorizations undersection 3006(b) of RCRA have continuing obligations to maintain state programsthat are equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than theFederal hazardous waste management program. Most commonly, State programrevisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR Parts260-266 and 124 and 270 that require corresponding changes in the stateprogram in order for the state to maintain its authorization. Codification Process EPA codifies its approval of State programs in Part 272 of Title 40, Codeof Federal Regulations (CFR) and incorporates by reference in Part 272the State statutes and regulations that EPA will enforce under section3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA. The purpose of codification is to provideclear notice to the public of the scope of the <T3>authorized </T3>program in each State. Such notice is particularlyimportant in view of the HSWA amendments and the changes in authorizedState programs required to reflect these new Federal requirements. By codifyingauthorized State programs and by amending the Code of Federal Regulationswhenever a new or different set of requirements is authorized, the statusof federally approved requirements in each State will be readily discernible.Thus, EPA is today codifying the Missouri authorized program in 40 Part272. (See 50 FR 28702, July 15, 1985, for a full discussion of the codificationprocess.) The Agency will only codify for enforcement purposes those provisions ofthe Missouri hazardous waste management program for which authorizationapproval has been granted by EPA. Concerning HSWA, some State requirementsmay be similar to HSWA requirements that are in effect under Federal statutoryauthority in that State. However, a State's HSWA-type requirements arenot authorized and will not be codified into the CFR until the RegionalAdministrator publishes his final decision to authorize the State for specificHSWA requirements. Until such time, EPA will enforce the HSWA requirementsand not the State analogs. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Missouri </ITAG>On November 20, 1985, EPA published a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice announcing its decision to grant finalauthorization for the RCRA base program to the State of Missouri. (See50 FR 47740.)As noted above, a State with final authorization has a continuing obligationto maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistentwith, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Tomeet this obligation, Missouri has submitted a request for additional programapprovals. The initial request was submitted June 27, 1986. Based on EPAcomments on that submission, the State submitted a revised and expandedrequest on December 1, 1987. The State is seeking approval of its programrevision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3).  EPA has reviewed Missouri's application, and determined that Missouri'shazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessaryto qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA is granting finalauthorization for the additional program modifications to Missouri. Today'sdecison is being published as an ``immediate final'' rule in accordancewith the provisions of 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). The public may submit writtencomments on this immediate final decision until the date noted in the ``Dates''section of this document. Approval of Missouri's program revision shallbecome effective 60 days from today unless an adverse comment pertainingto the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the endof the comment period. If an adverse comment is received EPA will publicheither (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a noticecontaining a response to comments which either affirms that the immediatefinal decision takes effect or reverses the decision.  Missouri has adopted by reference all of the required Federal Regulationsthrough July 1, 1986, as State requirements, plus one revision after thatdate. There are some areas in which the State has adopted Federal requirementsbut is not requesting authorization for those requirements at this time.Also, the State has adopted some provisions which, being broader in scopethan the Federal requirements, are not included in the Federally enforceableState rules being approved today.  The State has adopted and applied for authorization of the program provisionslisted below. For a fulll discussion of each of the provisions, the readeris referred to <T4>Federal Register</T4> promulgation of that provision. The provisionsare: Exclusion of Household Waste (November 13, 1984, 49 FR 44980), InterimStatus Standards_Applicability (November 21, 1984, 49 FR 46095), Correctionsto Test Methods Manual (December 4, 1984, 49 FR 47391), Satellite Accumulation(December 20, 1984, 49 FR 49571), Redefinition of Solid Waste (January4, 1985, 50 FR 614), Interim Status Standards for Landfills (April 23,1985) 50 FR 16044) State Availability of Information (see HSWA section3006(f)), Closure, Post-Closure and Financial Responsibility Requirements(May 2, 1986, 51 FR 16422), Listing of Spent Pickle Liquor (May 28, 1986,51 FR 19320) and Liability Coverage-Corporate Guanantee (July 11, 1986,51 FR 25350).  Availability of Information provisions where the subject of a complianceschedule published March 11, 1987 (52 FR 7412) allowing the State untilJune 30, 1987, for adoption, with an expectation that the State would submitan authorization request for it by September 30, 1987. The State met thisschedule.  In addition to the ten non-HSWA provisions, the State has adopted and requestedauthorization for several HSWA provisions. The State has adopted the listingsof the hazardous wastes dioxin (January 14, 1985, 50 FR 1978), toluene(October 23, 1985, 50 FR 42936), ethylene dibromide (February 13, 1986,51 FR 5330) and spent solvents (February 25, 1986, 51 FR 6541) as routineparts of the ongoing waste management program. The State will also requirethe use of the paint filter test (April 30, 1985, 50 FR 18370), as corrected(May 28, 1986, 51 FR 19176).  The application for the additional waste listings will not significantlyimpact the State's workload. The paint filter test is a requirement onthe regulated community and will not impact the State's workload. The managementstandards for dioxin wastes are extensive and generally considered quiteburdensome for a State program. However, the Missouri Department of NaturalResources has been deeply involved in the management of dioxin wastes inseveral parts of the State for many years. It is felt that reorganizingthe State requirements along the lines of the EPA requirements will bemore efficient for the State and for the regulated community and will notresult in an increased burden on the State. In summary, EPA has reviewedthe State program in light of current and proposed activities and has determinedthat authorizing these new provisions will not have profound effect onthe ability of the State to carry out the program.  There are some additional provisions which the State has adopted whichare broader in scope than Federal requirements. EPA is not approving theseprovisions and they will not become Federally enforceable. These provisionsare identified in the regulatory text of this document.  The State will assume lead responsibility for issuing permits for thoseprogram areas authorized today. For those HSWA provisions for which theState is not authorized, EPA will retain lead responsibility. For thosepermits which will now change to State lead from EPA, EPA will transfercopies of any pending applications, completed permits or pertinent fileinformation to the State within thirty days. EPA will be responsible forenforcing the terms and conditions of Federally issued permits while theyremain in force. EPA will also be responsible for enforcing the terms andconditons of RCRA permtis regarding HWSW provisions that the State doesnot have the authority to address. The State has agreed to review all Stateissued permits and to modify or reissue them as necessary to require compliancewith the currently approved State law and regulations. When the State reissuesFederally issued permits as State permits, EPA will rely on the State toenforce them, with the exception of those HSWA provisions not yet authorized.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Decision</ITAG>I conclude that Missouri's application for program revisions meets allof the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly,Missouri is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous wastemanagement program, as revised. Missouri now has responsibility for thepermitting of treatment, storage and disposal facilities within its bordersand carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitationof its revised program application and previously approved authorities.Missouri also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retainsthe right to conduct inspections under sections 3007, 3013, and 7003 ofRCRA.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Missouri Codification</ITAG>As noted above, EPA is codifying for enforcement purposes those provisionsof the Missouri hazardous waste management program for which authorizationapproval has been granted by EPA.To codify Missouri's authorized hazardous waste program, EPA is addingSubpart AA to Part 272 of Title 40 of the CFR. Subpart AA has previouslybeen reserved for Missouri. In andSection;272.1301(a), EPA is codifying forenforcement purposes the State statutes and regulations. Similarly, theMemorandum of Agreement, the Attorney General's Statement and the ProgramDescription are made part of the hazardous waste management program underSubtitle C of RCRA by codifying them in andSection;272.1301 (b), (c) and(d).The Agency retains the authority under sections 3008, 3013 and 7003 ofRCRA to undertake enforcement actions in authorized States. With respectto such an enforcement action, the Agency will rely on Federal sanctions,Federal inspection authorities and the Federal Administrative ProcedureAct rather than the State authorized analogs to these requirements. Therefore,the Agency does not intend to codify <T3>for purposes of enforcement </T3>such particular, authorized Missourienforcement authorities. Section 272.1301(a), Column (3) identifies thoseMissouri authorities that are part of the authorized program but are notcodified.The public also needs to be aware that some provisions of the State's hazardouswaste management program are not part of the Federally authorized Stateprogram. These non-authorized provisions are not part of the RCRA SubtitleC program because they are ``broader in scope'' than RCRA Subtitle C. (See40 CFR 271.1(i).) As a result, State provisions which are ``broader inscope'' than the Federal program are not codified for purposes of enforcementin Part 272. Section 272.1301(a), Column (4), of the codified text identifiesfor reference and clarify the statutory and regulatory provisions whichare ``broader in scope'' than the Federal program and which are thereforenot part of the authorized program being codified. ``Broader in scope''provisions will not be enforced by EPA; the State, however, will continueto enforce such provisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. HSWA Provisions</ITAG>As noted above, the Agency is not amending Part 272 to include many HSWArequirements and prohibitions that are immediately effective in all States.Section 3006(g) of RCRA provides that any requirement or prohibition ofHSWA (including implementing regulations) takes effect in authorized Statesat the same time that it takes effect in non-authorized States. Thus, EPAhas immediate authority to implement a HSWA requirement or prohibitiononce it is effective. A HSWA requirement or prohibition supersedes anyless stringent or inconsistent State provision which may have been previouslyauthorized by EPA. (See 50 FR 28702, July 15, 1985.) Because of the vastnumber of HSWA statutory and regulatory requirements taking effect overthe next few years, EPA expects that many previously authorized and codifiedState provisions will be affected. The States are required to revise theirprograms to adopt the HSWA requirements and prohibitions by the deadlinesset forth in 40 CFR 271.21, and then to seek authorization for those revisionspursuant to Part 271. EPA expects that the States will be modifying theirprograms substantially and repeatedly. Instead of amending the Part 272codification every time a new HSWA provision takes effect under the authorityof RCRA section 3006(g), EPA will wait until the State receives authorizationfor its analog to the new HSWA provision before amending the State's Part272 codification. In the interim, persons wanting to know whether a HSWArequirement or prohibition is in effect should refer to 40 CFR 271.1(j),as amended, which lists each such provision.The codification of State authorized programs in the CFR should substantiallyenhance the public's ability to discern the current status of the authorizedState program and clarify the extent of Federal enforcement authority.This will be particularly true as more State program revisions to adoptHSWA provisions are authorized.<ITAG tagnum="84">Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that thisauthorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicabilityof certain Federal regulations in favor of Missouri's program, therebyeliminating duplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste inthe State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule,therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance With Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 272</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Confidential business information,Hazardous waste transportation, Hazardous waste, Incorporation by reference,Intergovernmental relations, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="6">Morris Kay,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Regional Administrator.</ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 40 CFR Part 272 is amended asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 272_APPROVED STATE HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS</ITAG>1.
