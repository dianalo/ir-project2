Walsh'sbroadening Iran-Contra investigation.   Joseph F. Fernandez, the CIA's former station chief in CostaRica, was named Monday in a five-count indictment charging that heand unidentified co-conspirators ``deceitfully and without legalauthorization'' organized a private arms supply network for theContras when Congress banned such aid.   Fernandez, 51, who left the agency late last year after he wasdisciplined by CIA Director William Webster, also is charged withlying to his superiors to conceal the operation.   In addition, he is accused of obstructing an investigation ofthe Iran-Contra affair that was conducted by the presidentialcommission headed by former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas.   The indictment charges that Fernandez lied to the TowerCommission last year by stating that he did not know for a factthat fired National Security Council aide Oliver L. North wasinvolved in aiding the Contras.   Fernandez's attorney, Thomas Wilson, declined to comment on thecharges, saying he needed more time to study them.   Each of the five charges carries a maximum sentence of fiveyears in prison and a $250,000 fine.   The indictment shows that Walsh is continuing his grand juryinvestigation even while preparing for the trials of North, formernational security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealersAlbert Hakim and Richard V. Secord.   The judge in that case, Gerhard A. Gesell, indicated last weekhe was ready to schedule a trial for North in U.S. District Court.North and his co-defendants are to be tried separately on thecharges they conspired to divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profitsillegally to the Contras.   The case against Fernandez was assigned to Aubrey E. RobinsonJr., chief judge of the U.S. District Court here.   ``The grand jury's investigation is ongoing,'' associateindependent counsel Laurence Shtasel, told reporters after theindictment was returned against Fernandez.   Shtasel also suggested that the 18-month term of the specialgrand jury investigating the Iran-Contra affair be extended beforeits scheduled expiration next month.   The indictment charges that Fernandez helped North and Secord, aretired Air Force major general, coordinate air drops of weaponsand supplies to Contra groups in southern Nicaragua in 1986.   Fernandez, who operated in the field under the cover name TomasCastillo, also is accused of overseeing the construction of anairstrip in northern Costa Rica that the conspiracy built to helpdeliver arms to the rebels.   The indictment charges that Fernandez lied to an official of theCIA's Central American Task Force in September 1986 about thepurpose of the airstrip and later sent incomplete or unresponsivecable messages to the agency in response to CIA queries about thecovert operation.   The cables were designed to conceal the operation when the CIAquestioned Fernandez after a C123K cargo plane carrying weapons forthe Contras was shot down over Nicaragua on Oct. 5, 1986, theindictment says.   The indictment does not identify Fernandez's allegedco-conspirators and prosecutors declined to do so either. But alist of overt actions taken by the conspirators includes a June,28, 1985 meeting in Miami between North, Secord and Contra leadersAdolfo Calero and Enrique Bermudez.   It notes that Fernandez exchanged messages with North and theWhite House aide's associate Rafael Quintero over securecommunications devices supplied by North.   He also met with Robert W. Owen, an associate of North, todiscuss construction of the airstrip, the indictment said.   At the behest of North and Secord, Fernandez met with WilliamHaskell in late 1985 in the Costa Rican capital city of San Jose todiscuss the operation, according to the indictment.   Haskell, a former Marine colleague of North's who went by thepseudonym Robert Olmsted, helped negotiate the purchase of the landfor the airstrip, according to the report of the congressionalinvestigation of the Iran-Contra affair.   Fernandez is accused of helping North and Secord coordinate airdrops of arms to the Contras in April 1986 and participating ineight subsequent deliveries of weapons and supplies that year. Atthe time, Congress had banned direct U.S. military aid to theContras.   He is accused of lying to the CIA's inspector general office onJan. 11, 1987 by stating that the airstrip was built by the CostaRican government to train fighters for a possible invasion byNicaragua.   The indictment charged Fernandez also falsely told the TowerCommission that he did not know the supplies he helped deliver theContras in September 1986 included weapons and ammunition.   Fernandez told the congressional Iran-Contra committees that theoperations were authorized by CIA officials. But he admitted thathe misled both the Tower Commission and the CIA's inspectorgeneral, actions he said he thought were ``within the guidelines''set by Clair George, the agency's deputy director for operationswho retired last year.   Fernandez was one of several CIA officers disciplined by Websterlast December. Wilson said his client resigned from the agency.   Asked if he disputed press reports that Fernandez had beenfired, Wilson said: ``Maybe yes, maybe no, it depends on theperspective you take.''</TEXT></DOC>
