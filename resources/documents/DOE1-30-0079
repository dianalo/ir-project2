The special features of distribution of resourcesby the metropolis and districts were grasped and the biomass resourcesin Hokkaido as the model district were surveyed in detail. The amountof existing biomass resources in Japan is approximately one and a halfbillion tons and the forest land accounts for 94% of it. The amount ofproduction of biomass and amount of available energy are approximately160 million tons and approximately 100 million tons, respectively. Sincethe amount of production of biomass in Hokkaido is only 14% of that inJapan though the amount of existing biomass resources is 22%, the productioncapacity per unit area of land must be increased. The productions ofalcohol from glucide and starch and the recovery of silicon for semiconductor(seven times the nationwide production) from rice hulls are promising.The productions of methane and compost from the other resources are expected.The promising areas of biomass resources in Hokkaido are Obihiro, Asahikawaand three regions along the shore of the Sea of Okhotsk.
