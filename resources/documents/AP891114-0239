The delay from the original July announcement date contributedto a 30 percent drop in the computer giant's third-quarterearnings. Disk drives for storing data from mainframe computersaccount for about a tenth of IBM's roughly $60 billion in annualrevenue.   Some analysts had speculated that IBM's trouble came from aflawed part from an outside supplier. But IBM said it was achemistry problem that caused magnetic particles from a 10-inchplatter to cling to a read-write head, a microscopic version of thecommon problem of dirty heads on a tape recorder.   IBM solved the problem by using a different chemistry for thethin ``raspberry jam'' layer of material that covers the magneticparticles on the platter, according to Paul Low, president of theGeneral Products Division.   The new chemistry completely solved the problem and the new 3390disk drives are the most reliable in the industry, he said.   The new drives can do three times the work in one-third thefloor space of models introduced just two years ago, IBM said.   IBM said the disk drives will be shipped beginning Dec. 1 andthat the company expects to increase production enough to meetcustomer demand by the April-June quarter of next year.   IBM earned $877 million in the third quarter, down from $1.25billion a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
