In Lithuania, meanwhile, activists preparing for an expecteddeclaration of independence said the powerful Sajudis movementwants to replace the republic's Communist president, who couldstand in the way of immediate secession.   Lithuania would be the first of the Soviet Union's 15 republicsto declare independence and would confront President Mikhail S.Gorbachev with one of the worst crises in five years of governing.The Soviet Parliament is to vote Monday on his proposal to increasepresidential power over unruly republics.   All three Baltic republics _ Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania _have condemned the Soviet annexation of their lands a half centuryago and have strong pro-independence movements.   Sajudis, the pro-independence popular movement that dominatesLithuanian politics, will probably back one of its three leadingfigures for president of the republic, activists said as tonight'slegislative session neared.   Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas backs independence andhis Communist Party broke away from the national party in December.But Sajudis activist Haroldas Subachius said the group decided itwould be unfitting for him to be reelected because the Communistslost their majority in elections last month.   Many Sajudis members also fear Brazauskas is ``not firm enough''in his support for independence, Subachius said.   As chairman of the republic's 141-seat Supreme Soviet,Brazauskas conceivably could stave off immediate confrontation withthe Kremlin by delaying debate on the secession issue, which isexpected to begin Sunday.   The resolution by the Georgian Supreme Soviet legislature,quoted by the Independent News Agency of Georgia, ``denounces theoccupation and annexation of Georgia by Soviet Russia and considersit to be an international crime.''   It calls the entrance of troops ``a military interference,intervention and occupation with the aim of overthrowing theexisting political order'' and says: ``It is necessary to starttalks on restoration of an independent state of Georgia.''   The official news agency Tass, in a four-sentence report on theresolution, said nothing about the sections condemning the RedArmy's occupation of Georgia in Feb. 1921 and the subsequenttreaties that made Georgia part of the Soviet Union.   The mountainous Caucasus republic, the birthplace of formerSoviet ruler Josef Stalin, has 5 million residents. It first becamea part of the Russian empire in the early 1800s. It was brieflyindependent again after the Bolshevik revolution.   It has long had an active independence movement. In April,Soviet troops armed with gas and sharpened shovels killed 19pro-independence demonstrators while chasing them off the mainstreet of Georgia's capital Tbilisi.   The Georgian resolution calls ``inadmissible'' Gorbachev'sproposal for the president to declare a state of emergency andmartial law.   The declaration says that would ``introduce an authoritarianpresidential rule, which may be interpreted as the president'sright to remove organs of power in a union republic and thus tocompletely eliminate the republic's sovereignty.''   The resolution says the republic's deputies' participation inapproving the draft law also would be ``inadmissible.''   Gorbachev hopes to win approval of the constitutional amendmentin Monday's special session of the Congress of People's Deputies,despite progressives' complaints that the draft would give him``dictatorial'' powers.   The resolution says presidential measures taken to protect thenation's territorial unity ``should not conflict with therealization of a republic's right to secede from the USSR.''   Lithuania moved up its vote on declaring independence to Sundayprecisely because activists fear Gorbachev will use his new powersto forcibly prevent them from splitting from the Soviet Union.   Lithuania's newly elected lawmakers on Friday pressed on towarda showdown with Moscow, discussing how to take the reins of powerafter a declaration of independence.   ``Moscow is menacing us. We hope it's only with words,'' saidAnderus Kubilus, secretary of Sajudis, Lithuania's pro-independencemovement. ``We don't think there will be an acute economicblockade. It wouldn't be profitable for them, either economicallyor in terms of international opinion. But we don't know.''   In comments reported Wednesday by official Radio Vilnius,Gorbachev appeared to accept Lithuania's right to secede, butcautioned that the once-independent state would have to pay $34billion in compensation for factories built and money investedduring a half-century of Soviet rule.   The republic's parliament will be asked to reaffirm an act firstpassed on Feb. 16, 1918 declaring the state independent. Lawmakersalready have declared illegal Lithuania's incorporation into theSoviet Union in 1940 under a secret Nazi-Soviet pact.   Lawmakers also will be asked to restore the 1938 constitutionthat was swept away by Josef Stalin's Kremlin in favor of aSoviet-style law.</TEXT></DOC>
