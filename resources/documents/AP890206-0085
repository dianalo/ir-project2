Americans have been objecting to congressional pay raises fornearly all of the 200-year history of the Senate and House ofRepresentatives.   Alexis de Tocqueville, a close observer of American life, offeredan explanation in his 1835 study, ``Democracy in America.''   His conclusion: Democracies are far more stingy than other formsof government when it comes to paying high-ranking officials.   Part of the reason, de Tocqueville wrote, is that a salary levelwhich seems inadequate to the official receiving it ``appearsenormous to him whose wants do not extend beyond the necessities oflife.''   ``When he reflects on own humble dwelling and the small earningsof his hard toil, he remembers all he could do with a salary whichyou judge insufficient, and he is startled and almost frightened atthe view of so much wealth,'' he said.   More than 150 years later, little has changed.   ``We have never had a satisfactory method for settingcompensation for high government officials,'' says Senate MajorityLeader George Mitchell, D-Maine. ``We still do not.   ``If contemporary public opinion were the sole determinant, thepay of members of Congress today would be the same as it was in1789.''   The root of the problem is in the Constitution.   Article I, Section 6 provides: ``Senators and Representativesshall receive a compensation for their services, to be ascertainedby law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.''   That sounds well enough in theory.   But in practice it leaves the question of congressional paylevels up to Congress itself, posing an always sensitive,uncomfortabe and sometimes politically explosive problem.   Some of the framers of the Constitution thought it would givemembers of Congress a license to steal. Others argued that pressurefrom incensed constituents would rein in greedy impulses.   The issue has always been approached gingerly at best.   ``Bringing up the pay raise issue is about as welcome in alegislative body as a skunk is at a Sunday school picnic,'' saysSen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa.   The first major American squabble over a proposal to raise thepay of members of Congress arose in 1816 and it set back the earlypolitical career of Daniel Webster, who later was to become a famousorator, senator, and secretary of state.   From the convening of the 1st Congress in 1789 until 1816, a27-year span, members of Congress were paid at the rate of $6 a day_ with attempts made from time to time to dock the pay of absentees.   In 1816 Congress ended the day-by-day payments and adopted anannual salary of $1,500 a year.   The result: public outrage.   Nine members of Congress resigned and several were defeated inthe 1816 elections.   Webster was one of those ousted in the pay-raise revolt.   It took him until 1822 to persuade the voters to send him back toCapitol Hill.   The $1,500 annual salary also was a casualty; It was repealed in1817 and the next year congressional pay was set at $8 a day.   Eight dollars a day remained congressional pay for the next 38years.   The idea of an annual salary finally prevailed in 1854 when thecompensation for members was set at $3,000 a year.   Congressional pay rose to $5,000 a year in 1865.   But when Congress acted in 1871 to boost the total to $7,500annually, the voters rebelled again.   The higher salary had been made retroactive to the beginning ofthe 42nd Congress two years earlier, in effect giving members a lumpsum windfall of $5,000.   Congress already was besieged by accusations of corruption. Thenew pay increase brought cries of ``salary grab'' and ``back-paysteal.''   Members could not take the heat and when the 43rd Congressconvened dozens of bills were introduced to repeal the increase.   Congressional salaries soon were rolled back to the $5,000 levelwhere they remained until 1907, a period of 33 years.   Congressional pay was cut twice during the Depression of the1930s.   Salaries, which had reached $10,000 by 1925, were reduced to$9,000 in 1932 and to $8,500 the next year. But they have beengrowing slowly ever since.   The present congressional salary: $89,500.   The proposal by an independent commission: Increase it to$135,000 to more nearly approach the compensation offered in theprivate sector to lawyers, corporate executives and others withsimilar responsibilities.   The Senate has already rejected the raise, 95-0. The House may ormay not act.   The prospects _ as usual _ are highly uncertain.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Lawrence L.
