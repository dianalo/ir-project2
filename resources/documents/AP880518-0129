Gorbachev.   The Democratic-controlled Senate returned to the treaty a dayafter it finally opened debate on the pact signed last Dec. 8 byReagan and Gorbachev.   Reagan leaves next Wednesday for the summit, which begins May 29.   White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker told reporters it wouldbe ``a major plus'' if the Senate ratifies the treaty before thesummit.   Baker, former Senate majority leader, said he believes ``theodds are better than even'' the deadline will be met. ``That's upto the Senate and I hope my former colleagues in the Senate moveforward with speed, because to be able to take the ratificationdocuments to Moscow would be a major plus.''   ``Not taking them would be a disappointment _ it would not be adisaster _ but it would be a disappointment and might have someeffect on the Soviets' willingness to go forward to the nexttreaty,'' said Baker.   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., told reporters,``this treaty can be approved by the time the president leaves ifwe deal only with those serious, legitimate amendments that oughtto be dealt with on this issue.''   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said, ``I do hope thepresident will have the treaty when he goes to Moscow.''   But Dole and Byrd both said they expect a number of amendmentsto be offered later and they cautioned that the pact could bedelayed.   As debate opened Tuesday, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairmanof the Foreign Relations Committee, urged his colleagues to``proceed expeditiously to approve the treaty in ample time'' forthe summit.   Both Dole and Byrd have predicted that when the Senate finallyvotes, the pact will be ratified by far more than the 67 votesrequired.   Senate floor action had been delayed for more than a week by twodisputes, one over how the United States and the Soviets interpretthe on-site inspection verification provisions and the otherinvolving whether so-called ``futuristic'' weapons are banned bythe pact. Both nations agree they are.   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty requires theelimination within three years of all missiles with a range of 300miles to 3,400 miles.   There were no surprises Tuesday during opening statements.   Republican conservatives, including Sens. Jesse Helms of NorthCarolina and Steven Symms of Idaho, criticized the pact and said itcould damage the security of Western Europe.   ``I have a hunch that if Ronald Reagan were running forpresident this year instead of being in his last year in office hewould be out on the hustings demanding the Senate reject thistreaty,'' Helms contended.   But Reagan had a different view. The president told reporters atthe White House, ``I'm both hopeful and confident that aftercareful consideration, the Senate will agree that this treaty is adiplomatic milestone and will give its consent to United Statesparticipation.''   The treaty vote will be the first time that the Senate has actedon a U.S.-Soviet arms control pact since it ratified the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   The INF pact will also be the first to actually require thedestruction of weapons. Past treaties have simply slowed the rateof growth of the superpowers' arsenals.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., called the pact ``the beginning ofthe end of this mindless race to add ever more nuclear weapons.''   Helms and other critics have readied a series of amendments tomake significant changes in the treaty.   Helms said one of his amendments would require the withdrawal ofall U.S. military forces from Western Europe if the INF treatytakes effect. The United States has about 325,000 militarypersonnel stationed in Europe.   Helms argued that the U.S. forces would be defenseless if theU.S.-built Pershing 2 and cruise missiles are removed and he saidEuropeans should pay for their own defense.   Democratic leaders say that amendment is considered unlikely tobe approved and they have pushed for rejection of all but a singleamendment.   That proposal was adopted by the Foreign Relations Committee,and Republicans say it will be the subject of a floor fight as theytry to remove it.   The amendment would require future presidents to adhere to thecurrent interpretation of the INF pact offered by the Reaganadministration.   That amendment arose from a separate dispute over Reagan's claimthat his administration can unilaterally change how the UnitedStates views a separate pact, the 1972 ABM treaty. CongressionalDemocrats have disagreed with that contention.</TEXT></DOC>
