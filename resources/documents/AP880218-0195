The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also ordered the 3M Corp. torecall for inspection all 45,000 of the suspect devices, ionizingair guns used to control static electricity and remove dust fromproduct containers.   Robert Bernero, deputy director of the NRC's office of nuclearmaterials safety, said that of 828 plants inspected so far,``detectable'' _ though virtually harmless _ contamination had beenfound at 118 sites. Of those, he identified 39 plants where theradiation exceeded the reportable limit of .005 microcuries.   ``This is an incomplete list,'' said Bernero. ``It changesdaily.''   Last week, the NRC issued successive recalls of particular 3Mmodels used in the food, beverage, cosmetic and drug industries,involving about 2,500 units. The latest order affects allindustries and applies to all the devices made since they werefirst marketed in 1965.   Echoing earlier reports, NRC and Food and Drug Administrationofficials said Wednesday they still have no evidence that thefaulty devices have posed any health hazard, either to workers atplants where radioactive contamination was found or to consumers ofthe products made at those facilities.   Bernero said in more than 1,000 tests of product samples, therewas only once instance in which radiation was detected, involving afood supplement made by Ross Laboratories of Altavista, Va. In thatcase, the amount was so low it could have involved naturallyoccuring radiation, he said.   But he cited another case, involving Moto Photo of NorthDartmouth, Mass., where he expressed greater concern about what theinspectors don't know, rather than what they found. That facilityis in a shopping mall, he said, and how much of the leakedradioactive material ``might have been tracked out into the mall isjust unknown.''   NRC Chairman Lando Zech said the suspension and broadened recallorder was necessary in light of the growing list of plants whereinspectors found the devices had failed, leaking microscopicceramic spheres containing polonium 210, which emits a weak form ofradiation incapable of penetrating the skin but which could proveharmful if ingested in sufficient amounts.   FDA Administrator Frank Young said ``we're doing this to ensurethere's not the rare gun out there that's leaking a lot more thananything we've found so far.''   Ted L. Pickens, a 3M spokesman, said ``we're certainly going tocomply'' with the order. ``In this business you want to react withintegrity and ensure confidence,'' he said. At the same time,Pickens underscored the findings by federal officials that nohealth hazard appears involved.   Pickens declined to estimate what the recall and inspectionorder would cost the company, but said it would have no majoreffect on its overall treasury.   Polonium 210, a naturally occuring decay product of radium,emits alpha rays too weak to penetrate the skin. Though it couldprove a health threat if inhaled or swallowed in sufficientamounts, authorities say the protective ceramic covering on thematerial used in the 3M guns should preclude that danger. They saythe particles are too heavy to be inhaled, and the leaked materialin most cases fell harmlessly to the floor. Even if ingested, theshell, if intact, would pass through the body without harm in twoto four days, they say.   However, Young and others have expressed concern that some ofthe shell could be crushed or cracked, allowing more radiation toescape. Young said that if one of the particles were absorbed, itwould yield about 4 rem of radiation. By comparison, the averagecigarette smoker absorbs about 6 rem of polonium radiation in ayear.   Bernero said NRC investigators had found evidence in internal 3Mrecords that from 0.04 percent to 0.9 percent of the guns,depending on the model, were faulty, even though the companyreported far lower failure rates.   By late last week, the government had identified 28 plants werecontamination was found. The facilities just added to that list are:   Ford Motor Co.'s paint plant at Utica, Mich.; the Dial Corp.microwave lunch packaging plant at Ft. Madison, Iowa; the ProCorp., of Florence, Mass., maker of plastic cases for computers;the K-Mart film processing plant at Garland, Texas; the MicroTechnology electronic chips plant at Boise, Idaho; Miller Containerof Milan, Ill.; McLaughlin Body Co. of East Moline, Ill.; SuperPhoto of New Orleans, and Moto Photo and Ross Laboratories.</TEXT></DOC>
