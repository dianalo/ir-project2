Using parallel processing rulemaking procedures, EPA proposedapproval of two conditional Plan Approvals issued by the MassachusettsDepartment of Environmental Protection (DEP) which imposed and definedVOC control methods as RACT for Cranston Print Works Company, Webster DivisionFacility (Cranston) located in Webster, Massachusetts. This final rulemakingaction approves the final, formal SIP revision submitted by the MassachusettsDEP on July 18, 1989. This notice is divided into four parts:<ITAG tagnum="25">I.

Public Comments </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">IV. Final Action </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background Information </ITAG>On November 9, 1983 (48 FR 51480), EPA approved Massachusetts Regulation310 CMR 7.18(17), ``Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT),'' aspart of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 1982 ozone attainment plan. Thisregulation requires the Massachusetts DEP to determine and impose RACTon all facilities with the potential to emit one hundred tons per year(TPY) or more of VOC that are not already subject to Massachusetts' regulationsdeveloped pursuant to the EPA Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) documents.On February 4, 1988 and February 29, 1988, the Massachusetts DEP submitteda SIP revision for Cranston to EPA for parallel processing. This SIP revisionwas composed of two Plan Approvals for Cranston which imposed VOC controlrequirements as RACT. On February 2, 1989 (54 FR 5247), EPA proposed approvalof the two Plan Approvals with the understanding that the MassachusettsDEP would amend the Plan Approvals and submit additional documentationas outlined in the NPR prior to final rulemaking. On July 18, 1989, theMassachusetts DEP formally submitted an amended Plan Approval, dated andeffective June 20, 1989, which supercedes the February 1988 Plan Approvalsand incorporates all the provisions required by EPA's NPR. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of the SIP Revision Including the Changes Made to SecureFinal EPA Approval </ITAG>Cranston is a fabric printing company. It prints fabrics which are usedprimarily in the high-fashion apparel industry. Its VOC emissions resultfrom two processes, the acid ager process and the fabric printing process.Acid Ager Process The acid ager process is controlled by a scrubber which achieves 99% efficiency.The acid ager process and the details of the RACT plan were outlined inthe NPR and will not be restated here. EPA's NPR required five changesto the Massachusetts DEP's SIP submittal prior to final rulemaking. Howthe Massachusetts DEP's July 18, 1989 submittal satisfies the requirementsof the NPR for the acid ager process is summarized below: 1. The June 20, 1989 Plan Approval requires that Cranston maintain an overallscrubber efficiency greater than or equal to 99% at all times. 2. The June 20, 1989 Plan Approval requires that the acid ager emissionsshall not exceed 0.6 lb/hr. 3. The June 20, 1989 Plan Approval contains additional operating limitations,monitoring provisions, and recordkeeping requirements to ensure that the99% efficiency of the scrubber is maintained at all times. 4. The Massachusetts DEP formally submitted, and EPA has approved, a revisionto the Massachusetts SIP requiring all non-CTG RACT sources subject to310 CMR 7.18(17) to use EPA-approved test methods (54 FR 9212). 5. The Massachusetts DEP has certified that the inclusion of the acid agerline in the June 20, 1989, Plan Approval is a reasonable outgrowth of theRACT proposal which went to the public hearing on October 7, 1986.For further details on these changes please refer to the Technical SupportDocument prepared for this revision which may be obtained from the EPARegional Office listed in the ADDRESSES section of this notice.Fabric Printing ProcessThe fabric printing process employs five roller and four rotary screenprinting machines. The primary source of VOC emissions from this processwas the mineral spirits print paste used on the roller printing machines.Cranston has reduced VOC emissions from its fabric printing operationsby reformulation, changes in production schedules, and replacement of theroller printers with screen printers. The RACT emission limit imposed inthe February 1988 Plan Approvals was 82.5 lb VOC/1000 lb fabric printed(averaged over 24 hours). The fabric printing process and the details ofthe RACT plan were outlined in the NPR and will not be restated here. EPA'sNPR required that the Massachusetts DEP submit additional documentationprior to final rulemaking. The documentation was required to support that82.5 lb VOC/1000 lb fabric printed was RACT for this process. The NPR requiredthat the Massachusetts DEP justify why Cranston could not achieve a 65%reduction with add-on control technology, or could not use print pasteswith equivalent formulations to those set forth in the Massachusetts SIP'sGraphic Arts Regulation. Cranston now complies with limitations equivalentto the SIP's Graphic Arts RACT limitation by using low-solvent print pasteformulations. The June 20, 1989, amended Plan Approval requires Cranstonto use print pastes which comply at all times with the limits the MassachusettsSIP Graphic Arts Regulation. EPA's NPR required additional changes priorto final rulemaking. How the Massachusetts DEP's July 18, 1989, submittalsatisfies the NPR's requirements for the Fabric Printing Process is brieflysummarized below:1. Cross-line averaging is not allowed.2. The Massachusetts DEP has submitted, and EPA has approved, a SIP revisionrequiring non-CTG RACT sources subject to 310 CMR 7.18(17) to use EPA-approvedtest methods (54 FR 9212).3. The Plan Approval requires Cranston to record the density of the mineralspirits on a daily basis.For further details on these changes please refer to the Technical SupportDocument prepared for this revision which may be obtained from the EPARegional Office listed in the <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comments</ITAG>EPA received a letter of public comment on its proposed approval of theMassachusetts DEP's SIP submittal. The comment letter was submitted byCranston. The majority of the comments were on the feasibility of compliancewith the Massachusetts Graphic Arts Regulation. These comments are no longerrelevant because Cranston now complies with coating limits equivalent toMassachusetts Graphic Arts Regulation, and the June 20, 1989, imposes suchlimits. The two remaining comments are addressed below.<T3>Comment: </T3>Cranston commented on EPA's statement that the reductionin VOC emissions from the fabric roller printers is 8% on a daily basis.Cranston claims that EPA compared a 1988 maximum daily emission rate (inthe Plan Approval) of 82.5 lb VOC/1000 lb fabric printed with the yearlyaverage emission rate in 1980 of 89.8 lb VOC/1000 lb fabric printed (8%reduction). Cranston states that the correct comparison is to compare thetwo averages of 89.8 lb VOC/1000 lb fabric printed in 1980 with the averageof 38.6 lb VOC/1000 lb fabric printed in 1987. Cranston states that thiscomparison shows a decrease of 57%.<T3>Response: </T3>The average emission rate of 38.6 lb VOC/1000 lb fabricprinted was not included as an enforceable condition of the MassachusettsDEP's Plan Approvals. EPA agrees that the reduction (as averaged over ayear) was 57%. However, this was not an enforceable reduction achievedby Cranston on every day of operation. Cranston could have emitted up to82.5 lb VOC/lb fabric printed under the previous Plan Approvals; therewas no enforceable limit in the Plan Approvals to ensure compliance witha limit of 38.6 lb VOC/lb fabric printed. The Massachusetts DEP's June20, 1989, revised Plan Approval requires Cranston to use print paste formulationsequivalent to those set forth in the Massachusetts Graphic Arts Regulation.This meets the RACT requirements outlined in EPA's NPR and results in anenforceable 69% reduction in the VOC content of the volatile portion ofthe ink.<T3>Comment:</T3> The Company asked for the use of 25% VOC print pasteon the screen printers to ensure product quality and to remain competitivein the industry.<T3>Response:</T3> The Massachusetts DEP's June 20, 1989, revised PlanApproval requires Cranston to comply with a limitation of 5.4% or lessby volume VOC in the volatile portion of the print paste for each printpaste formulation. Since the revised Plan Approval still requires a significantoverall VOC reduction at the plant, the Massachusetts DEP believes thatit is reasonable to allow Cranston to use low-solvent print pastes on thescreen printers to give the Company some flexibility in its day-to-dayprinting operations. The Massachusetts DEP demonstrated that a 93% reductionis still achieved by installation of screen printers (which use low-solventprint pastes rather than no VOC print pastes). EPA concurs with this determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Final Action</ITAG>EPA is approving the Massachusetts DEP's June 20, 1989, Amended Plan Approvalimposing RACT on Cranston Print Works Company as a revision to the MassachusettsSIP.The NPR also required the Massachusetts DEP to submit additional documentationto support the proposed limit of 82.5 lb VOC/1000 lb fabric printed asRACT for the fabric printing process. The NPR stated that EPA would providethe opportunity for comment on the additional documentation submitted bythe Massachusetts DEP prior to final approval of this revision. The MassachusettsDEP did not submit additional documentation; it imposed the more stringentGraphic Arts print paste limits on Cranston. Therefore, no additional opportunityfor comment is necessary and this action will become effective 30 daysfrom the date of publication.This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administratorunder the procedures published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Tables 2 and 3 SIPrevisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of ExecutiveOrder 12291 for a period of two years.Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing orestablishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP.Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately inlight of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and inrelation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial reviewof this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals forthe appropriate circuit by (60 days from date of publication). This actionmay not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.(See section 307(b)(2).)<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmental relations,Ozone, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Incorporation by reference of the State Implementation Planfor the State of Massachusetts was approved by the Director of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 1, 1982.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Paul G.
