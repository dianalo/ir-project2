Sections 100.7(b)(8) and 100.8(b)(9) exempt certain unreimbursedpayments for transportation and subsistence costs from the definitionsof contribution and expenditure.

Although these proposed rules addressthree unrelated areas, the Commission is combining them in a single rulemakingbecause the changes under consideration are discrete issues that do notrequire a larger scale rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">A. Travel Expense Exemption</ITAG>An individual may make unreimbursed payments for personal travel expenseswhich are exempt from the definition of contribution if the payments donot exceed $1000 per candidate per election or $2000 on behalf of all politicalcommittees of a political party in a calendar year. 2 U.S.C. 431(8)(B)(iv).The Commission's regulations implement this exemption at sections 100.7(b)(8)and 100.8(b)(9). In the regulations, the Commission has treated the componentsof personal travel expenses as two separate categories, transportationcosts and subsistence expenses. The limited exemption for travel costshas been applied solely to the costs incurred for transportation on a candidate'sor party's behalf, while the amount of subsistence expenses have not beensubject to limit under the Commission's rules.When the travel expense exemption was first added to the Federal ElectionCampaign Act (``FECA'') in 1974, it only covered volunteers. <T3>See </T3>2 U.S.C. 431 (3)(5)(D) and (f)(4)(E) [1974]. Thus, the Commission'searliest regulations on this provision addressed a volunteer's transportationand subsistence expenses. <T3>See </T3> 11 CFR 100.4(b)(6) and 100.7(b)(8) [1977]. The 1979 amendmentsto the FECA expanded the scope of persons who could travel under the exemptionto include ``individuals who are being paid by a candidate or party committee.''H.R. Rep. 96-422, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. at 8. However, when the Commission'sregulatons were redrafted in 1980 to reflect the new amendments, only thetransportation exemption was broadened. The provision allowing volunteersto incur unlimited personal subsistence expenses in the course of theirvolunteer activity remained unchanged.The Commission is now considering revising the subsistence exemption inandSection;andSection; 100.7(b)(8) and 100.8(b)(9) to allow paid campaign staffand party committee employees to take advantage of the exemption. Sincethe role of paid employees differs from that of volunteers, however, theproposed rules would treat these two groups separately. Paid staff memberswould be permitted to defray their own subsistence expenses while theyare paying their own transportation costs under the travel exemption. Volunteerswould continue to be able to pay all of their subsistence costs incidentto volunteer activity.Congressional intent in expanding the statutory provision in 1979 appearsto have been limited to allowing committee employees to take advantageof the transportation exemption. <T3>See </T3>H.R. Rep. 96-422, <T3>supra. </T3>Paid staff are likely, however, to travel extensively ona candidate's or party's behalf. An unlimited subsistence exemption forthose persons could result in staff members paying considerable amountsfor costs that should be paid by the committees as campaign or party expenditures.consequently, the Commission is proposing to limit payment of subsistenceexpenses by such employees to those they incur while traveling under theexemption, to make clear that costs paid by the employees at other timesmust be reimbursed or be considered contributions. This proposed limitationwould not, of course, prohibit employees from paying their usual livingcosts when they are not on travel status.The Commission is proposing to make two additional changes in these sections.First, andSection;andSection; 100.7(b)(8) and 100.8(b)(9) would each be dividedinto two subsections, covering the exemption for transportation costs inparagraph (i) and for subsistence costs in paragraph (ii). In addition,paragraph (ii) would provide a definition of ``usual and normal subsistenceexpenses,'' to include only the personal living expenses of the volunteeror staff member, such as food or lodging. Other expenses, such as the costof renting a meeting room, would not be covered by the exemption. Thisproposed definition would be consistent with the definition of ``subsistence''recently promulgated at 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(iii). <T3>See </T3>52 FR 20864, 20875 (June 3, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Disclaimer Notice Requirements</ITAG>In the second area addressed by this Notice, the Commission is consideringa possible amendment to the disclaimer notice requirements set forth at11 CFR 110.11(a)(1)(iv)(A). Section 441d(a) of the Act requires that communicationswhich expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identifiedcandidate through general public political advertising include a disclaimernotice stating the name of the person who paid for the communication andwhether the communication is authorized by a candidate, an authorized politicalcommittee of a candidate, or its agents. That section also requires thatany person who solicits contributions thorugh general public politicaladvertising shall include the same disclaimer notice, even if the solicitationdoes not contain any express advocacy language.The current regulations at 11 CFR 110.11(a)(1)(iv)(A) require that solicitationsdirected to the general public on behalf of an unauthorized political committeeclearly state the full name of the person who paid for the communication.The Commission proposes to revise this paragraph to reflect the additionalstatutory requirement that the solicitation state whether or not it wasauthorized by any candidate, any authorized political committee, or itsagents. The purpose of this proposed revision is to bring 110.11(a)(1)(iv)(A)into closer conformity with the requirements of the Act in this area.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Trade Association Solicitations</ITAG>The Act permits trade associations to solicit the executive or administrativepersonnel, stockholders, and families of such personnel and stockholders(the ``restricted class'') of the trade association's member corporations,subject to certain conditions. 2 U.S.C. 441b(b)(4)(D). Section 114.8(f)of the Commission's regulations applies this basic rule to situations inwhich a parent corporation is a member of the trade association but itssubsidiary is not, or vice versa. As currently written, if the parent corporationis a member but the subsidiary is not, section 114.8(f) provides that thetrade association may only solicit the restricted class of the parent.When discussing the reverse situation, however, that section states thatthe trade association is prohibited from soliciting only the ``shareholders''of a non-member parent corporation. To make this provision consistent withthe Act, the Commission is proposing to revise the second sentence of andSection;114.8(f) to state that the trade association may not solicit any of a non-memberparent corporation's restricted class.The Commission welcomes comments on the foregoing proposed amendments to11 CFR 100.7(b)(8), 100.8(b)(9), 110.11(a)(1)(iv)(A), and 114.8(f).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>11 CFR Part 100Elections.11 CFR Part 110Political committees and parties, Political candidates.11 CFR Part 114Business and industry, Elections.Certification of no Effect Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) [Regulatory FlexibilityAct]These proposed rules will not, if promulgated, have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.
