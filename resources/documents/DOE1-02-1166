Underground testsconcentrated on the heat dissipation around buried high-level radioactivewastes and the geomechanical consequences of their disposal. Near-fieldinvestigations cover the properties of water and gas release, radiolysisand corrosion. Further objectives of field experiments are the developmentand underground testing of a handling system for high-level wastes. Theperformance of an underground test disposal for such wastes is not onlyconsidered to be necessary for technical and scientific reasons but alsofor improving public acceptance of the concept of radioactive waste disposal.</TEXT></DOC>
