For absolute analytical techniques they could be loweredto 10/sup -14/ g/g. The separation methods applied include ion exchange,solvent extraction as well as classical precipitation methods. The successfulapplication of the procedure to problems in meteorite research is givenby example.</TEXT></DOC>
