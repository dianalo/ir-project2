The announcement was a rebuff of President Ranasinghe Premadasa,who on Monday sent three Cabinet ministers to urge theTamil-controlled provincial council in Trincomalee to support hisefforts to get Indian troops to leave Sri Lanka.   At a news conference in the city 150 miles northeast of Colombo,the groups said they founded a Tamil National Council and will seeka ``Tamil homeland that shall be fully responsible for theTamil-speaking people.''   India has said its troops, who began arriving July 30, 1987,cannot leave until they complete their mission of disarming otherTamil groups and the provincial council in Trincomalee is allowedto exercise more local autonomy.   Also today, about 40 wives and children of Indian diplomats leftSri Lanka to avoid any trouble that might arise this weekend, thedeadline set by Premadasa for the departure of Indian troops.   About 40 other relatives of Indian diplomats and securitystaffers at the high commission, returned to India on Sunday,according to a spokesman for the high commission, or embassy.   A shadowy group called the Workers Action Front, believed tohave links with Sinhalese extremists, called for a three-dayprotest against the Indian presence starting Wednesday.   Sinhalese radicals accuse the government of making too manyconcessios to Tamil separatists and not doing enough to get theIndian troops to leave.   Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.Tamils, who make up 18 percent, say the Sinhalese discriminateagainst them in jobs, education and use of the Sinhala language.   Military sources today reported 10 more killings of Sinhalese inthe past two days in Colombo and the Sinhalese heartland ofsouthern and central Sri Lanka. Ultranationalist Sinhalese from thePeople's Liberation Front were blamed for seven of the deaths, andthe three others were front guerrillas killed by security forces.</TEXT></DOC>
