President Bush pretty much squelched the Soviet planyesterday, with the remark that while he was happy to getMikhail Gorbachev's letter describing the discussions betweenthe two countries, &quot;it falls well short of what would berequired.&quot; No change in allied military plans.</LP><TEXT>   The plan offered by the superpower with no troops fightingIraq pledged that Iraq's borders were inviolate, that Saddamhimself would not be punished, that no reparations would bepaid and that there would be linkage to side issues such asIsrael and the Palestinians. This is scarcely the stuff ofthe dozen U.N. Security Council Resolutions that Moscoworiginally backed and still claims to support.   The Soviet offer to Iraq, for example, violated U.N.Resolution 674 of October 19, which made clear that Iraqwould have to pay reparations. The resolution said that Iraq&quot;is liable for any loss or injury arising in regards toKuwait and third states, and their nationals andcorporations, as a result of the invasion and illegaloccupation of Kuwait.&quot; It also &quot;invites states to collectrelevant information regarding their claims . . . forrestitution or financial compensation by Iraq.&quot;   We thought Gorbachev aide Yevgeny Primakov was going tobang the desk with his shoe when Ted Koppel raised thisinconsistency on &quot;Nightline.&quot; &quot;If people believe that we haveto report everything to the U.S. and not have any individualline, then this is a mistake,&quot; he said. &quot;The Soviet Union hasnot been reduced to the status of a secondary power.&quot;   At least the Soviets did not go as far as Saddam did lastweek. He demanded that the allies pay &quot;Iraq&quot; reparations torebuild his country &quot;in accordance with the bestspecifications regarding all the enterprises andinstallations.&quot; Saddam also requires all countries and banksto write off Iraqi debts. What's chutzpah in Arabic?   More broadly, the U.N. is now clearly on record supportinggoals in the Gulf going well beyond the original demand forunconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. The key isResolution 678, passed November 29. It echoes Mr. Bush's newworld order, authorizing &quot;all necessary means&quot; to implementprevious resolutions calling for withdrawal, reparations,etc. and also &quot;to restore international peace and security inthe area.&quot;   This raises the issue in everyone's mind: Can there bepeace and security so long as Saddam remains in power and hismilitary remains a threat? Even if Saddam's military isdeclawed, can there be stability if he survives in power? Wedoubt it, especially if the Soviets have decided to play outtheir own game. The presence of even a defeated Saddam, asBernard Lewis eloquently outlines alongside, would in itselfbe a font of instability and further mischief (see relatededitorial: &quot;Who'll Win, Who'll Lose in the Gulf&quot; -- WSJ Feb.20, 1991).   Surely the U.N. resolution is broad enough to encompassthis insight -- and no doubt deliberately so, given that byits nature diplomatic language does not lend itself to clearwar aims. Mr. Bush, in addition to wide and deep popularsupport at home, has extraordinary international backing toprosecute this war until he has confidence that a more stableGulf can emerge. The Soviets are in no position to decide theterms of any settlement or the precise war aims. The right todecide those issues has been earned by the allies fighting inthe region.</TEXT></DOC>
