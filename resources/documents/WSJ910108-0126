Gigot correctlyobserved in his Dec. 18 editorial-page article, &quot;A GreatAmerican Screw-Up: The U.S. and Iraq,&quot; Reagan and Bushadministration policies actually fostered the deployment ofIraqi armies now arrayed against U.S. troops.   &quot;An army marches on its stomach,&quot; Napoleon instructed hisgenerals. Saddam took that lesson to heart. With the help ofbillions of dollars of U.S.-financed food, Saddam marched hisarmies across the Middle East to confront U.S. commanders anddiplomats.</LP><TEXT>   Beginning in 1983, the U.S. provided subsidies of about $5billion to Saddam to buy food, making Iraq one of the topbeneficiaries of U.S. Agriculture Department export promotionprograms during the 1980s. With the U.S. Treasury open to himand U.S.-taxpayer-financed foodstuffs easing the strain onhis own strapped treasury, Saddam was able to concentrateIraq's dwindling cash reserves on his war against Iran andsubsequent buildup of his military. The USDA credits were tobecome the backbone of the U.S.-Iraqi relationship.   Despite alarming, gruesome evidence of some of the mosthorrific human-rights violations of this century and despiteinternal-staff recommendations against granting furthersubsidies to Iraq, our administration continued to approvenew loan guarantees for Saddam. In one instance, itreallocated credits away from already approved lines ofcredits for other countries in order to boost the total forIraq, to stay in Saddam's favor.   Administration policy sent contradictory signals not onlyto Iraq but also to Congress and the public. While officialstold Congress they opposed withholding food subsidies fromIraq based on fundamental opposition to using food as aforeign-policy tool, they were lobbying Congress to overlookhuman-rights abuses, including the use of chemical weapons,and to vote down sanctions against Iraq in order to keep thepipeline of subsidized food flowing to warm relations betweenWashington and Baghdad.   At first, Congress failed to reverse the Reagan-Bushpolicies and initially disapproved of sanctions againstSaddam. The leadership of Congress, in the form of adelegation headed by the Senate minority leader, assuredSaddam of its opposition to legislation to cut off thesubsidies and went so far as to exercise senatorialprerogative blocking debate on the bill.   The administration and its congressional allies remainedcaptivated by the mind-set that fostered the &quot;great Americanscrew-up.&quot; After years of using taxpayer-subsidized food as aforeign-policy weapon to get close to the enemy of our enemy,and after years of feeding Saddam's armies, even as the warclouds darkened, the administration opposed congressionalaction to suspend Iraq from USDA's subsidies, up to less thana week before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.   Evidence of fraud, the siphoning of taxpayer funds topurchase material easily converted to military applications,demands for kickbacks and growing alarm at Saddam'shuman-rights record finally, albeit too late, tipped thebalance and the House adopted my amendment to end Iraq'saccess to USDA's pocketbook.   Saddam would never have been able to deploy his armiesagainst ours had their stomachs not been full, with U.S.subsidized bread. Analysts have called the current PersianGulf crisis the first test of post-Cold War diplomacy; forthe U.S. to pass the test, we must not forget the lessonsthat led to it.   Rep. Dan Glickman (D., Kan.)   Chairman   Wheat, Soybeans and Feed Grains Subcommittee   Washington   ---   Congratulations are in order for Mr. Gigot. After a decadeof expanded malpractice liability in which every doctor,lawyer, engineer, architect and investment banker whoinflicted the slightest real or imagined harm on others couldexpect to be hauled into court, it is ironic that the handfulof federal officials whose inattentiveness caused the currentcrisis will escape retribution for their errors.   By exposing the foreign-policy bureaucracy's incompetence,which has placed the lives of American servicemen andservicewomen in jeopardy, Mr. Gigot has shattered the liberalmyth that government is our protecter.
