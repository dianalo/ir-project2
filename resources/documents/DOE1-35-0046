These studies provide informationto estimate potential health effects in accidentally exposed people.Specific radionuclides ({sup 90}Sr, {sup 90}Y, {sup 91}Y, {sup 137}Cs,{sup 144}Ce, {sup 238}Pu, and {sup 239}Pu), chemical forms, and particlesizes were selected for study because they are abundant in nuclear operationsand deliver a wide range of radiation dose patterns. Depending upon theaerosol, one or more of the following organs or tissues received thesignificant irradiation: lung, nasal cavity, lung-associated lymph nodes,whole body, liver, or skeleton, with the radiation dose delivered overdurations of time ranging from a few days to several years. In eightstudies monodisperse particles of either {sup 238}PuO{sub 2} or {sup239}PuO{sub 2} were used to evaluate the influence of particle numberand total dose on lung cancer induction. Most studies involved single,brief exposures of young adult dogs, but two studies used immature dogs,two used aged dogs, and two studies involved repeated brief exposures.For each aerosol two types of studies were conducted. One was used toevaluate the time course of retention of radioactivity in various tissuesof the body for calculating radiation doses. The second was used to determinehealth effects in animals exposed to achieve different initial lung burdensand observed for the remainder of their life spans. Initial lung burdenswere selected to produce early morbidity and mortality at the highestlevels and an excess of late-occurring diseases such as cancer at thelowest levels. The latter dogs have had an excess incidence of cancer,especially of the lung, lung-associated lymph nodes, nasal cavity, skeleton,and liver. Relationships between radiation doses to various tissues andeffects have been evaluated for individual studies.</TEXT></DOC>
