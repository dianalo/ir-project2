Since 1970 when a tank-type GCB was delivered, Nissin has produced3.6 to 300 kV GCBs and applied them to various switchgears. Nissin'sgas circuit breakers and switchgears are available in three types: (1)Runarc -- Compact GCBs which consists of a breaker with sulfur hexafluoridegas enclosed in an epoxy resin mold container and an operating section;(2) 24/36 kV cubicle tank-type GCB -- Compact GCB fitted with two components:a single pressure puffer-type arc extinguishing chamber in which sulfurhexafluoride gas at a constant pressure is enclosed in a grounding tankprovided for each phase and an operating section having electricallydriven springs; (3) Sulfur hexafluoride gas high-voltage electromagneticcontactor -- best suited to switchgears of high-voltage capacitors andfor transformers of high-voltage motors. GCBs in the future seem to embodycompound technology for maintenance-free operation, high reliability,and advanced functions. (10 figs, 5 tabs, 3 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
