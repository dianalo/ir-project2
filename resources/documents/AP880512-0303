The department released new estimates for offshore oil and gassupplies and backup material for onshore estimates released inMarch.   By coincidence, the new material was released shortly after theEnergy Department said it believed the nation had a 35-year supplyof natural gas at prices under $3 per thousand cubic feet, and a $5price would bring forth only another 10 years supply.   Estimates of undiscovered onshore oil released by the GeologicalSurvey in March were down about 40 percent from previous figures,in part because of drilling disappointments but also because lowerprices keep explorers from even considering high-cost pools.   Today's numbers were broken down by area, and departmentofficials refused to supply totals, citing their desire to avoidgiving any impression the figures were unchangeable.   But simple addition showed that the mean estimate _ thatestimate which there is a 50 percent chance of exceeding _ was 8.87billion barrels of oil, down 27 percent, and 74 trillion cubic feetof natural gas, down 18 percent. Expressed in terms of equivalentenergy content, the new estimates would be 22 percent below the oldones.   The same estimates in 1984 were 12.2 billion barrels of oil and90.5 trillion cubic feet of gas.   The decline, according to an Interior Department analyst whospoke on condition he not be identified, can be attributed todrilling disappointments, notably in Alaska, and lower prices.   The new estimates assume oil costs $18 a barrel, about thecurrent price. The old estimates assumed oil costs of about $30 abarrel.   Energy Secretary John Herrington said in announcing the newreserve estimates that ``natural gas has not taken its rightfulplace'' in the nation's energy supplies and the department wastrying to allay public fears of short supplies left over frompipeline curtailments in the severe northeastern winters of 1976-77and 1977-78.   If price were no object, current technology could recover about1,029 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, the Energy Departmentstudy said. At $3 per thousand cubic feet or less, 583 trillioncubic feet could be produced. An increase in price to $5 wouldbring only an additional 174 trillion cubic feet.   The nation uses about 17 trillion cubic feet of natural gas peryear. The average wellhead price last year was $1.83, which thedepartment's semi-independent Energy Information Administrationpredicts will reach $4.02 in the year 2000.</TEXT></DOC>
