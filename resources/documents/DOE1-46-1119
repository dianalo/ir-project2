<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-46-1119 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have developed flexible long-lived carbon stripper foils of about 10{mu}g/cm/sup 2/ in thickness by a controlled dc carbon arc-dischargemethod. The foils are not only mechanically strong, but also long-livedunder bombardment with a 3.2 MeV Ne/sup +/ ion beam of 1 {mu}A in intensity.The mean lifetime is around 12 h. The key point in producing long-livedfoils is to control the amount of carbon particles coming from the cathodeby controlling the cathode spot temperature.</TEXT></DOC>
