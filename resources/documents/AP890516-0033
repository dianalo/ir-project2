If it doesn't start clearing up, we're issuing snorkels toeverybody out there. ...   I want to say how pleased I am that the secretary of theTreasury is with me, Nick Brady; our attorney general, the ableDick Thornburgh; and our drug czar, Secretary Bill Bennett.   The fact that we four are here is intentional, it sends a signalof our commitment and of our interest.   And I know members of Congress are here as well.   I spotted my own senator, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, andSenator Pete Wilson.   But I'm going to be in trouble because I can't see over therewho else is there, but I know many are sitting right over here, andwe salute them.   I see Senator Ford and others, and we're just delighted thatthey're here today. (Applause).   Last fall, a retired New York police lieutenant gave me badgenumber 14072, and I have it with me here today, the badge his sonwore the day he was gunned down by a gang of cocaine cowards.   Matt Byrne asked me to keep Eddie's badge as a reminder of allthe brave police officers who put their lives on the line for usevery single day.   Matt, your son's badge, as I have told you, is kept in my deskat the Oval Office.   And during the debate on gun-related violence that has raged inthis country the past several months, neither it nor what itrepresents has ever been far from my mind.   I've heard the many voices, the courageous and thecompassionate, the wounded and the widowed.   And I salute the survivors who are here today.   We gather today to respond to those voices and to honor thefallen by launching a national strategy, a partnership withAmerica's cities and states to take back the streets.   It calls for a return to common sense, and it begins with aclear-eyed vision of the kind of problems we face, the kind ofpeople we are, the kind of values that we hold, and the kind ofnation we intend to bequeath to our children.   The problem is violent crime, and in particular the blood that'sbeen shed by increasingly sophisticated guns in the hands of a newclass of criminals.   Usually, but not always, the deaths are tied to a cycle ofdollars and drugs and dependency.   The principles are simple.   My generation will remember what some believe was FDR's finestspeech _ the four freedoms _ an address to a joint session of theCongress.   And the last, often forgotten but arguably the most fundamentalof those freedoms was simply this: freedom from fear.   Our sworn duty to ensure domestic tranquility is as old as therepublic, placed in the Constitution's preamble even before thecommon defense and the general welfare.   And so when we ask what kind of society the American peopledeserve, our goal must be a nation in which law-abiding citizensare safe and feel safe.   To achieve this goal, people must be held accountable for theiractions, and that's common sense.   Most Americans are law-abiding.   And most believe that there is such a thing as right and wrong,good and evil.   And whether it's the brutalization of a young runner in a parkor terrorizing a young man onto a crowded highway, these are actsthat cannot be excused or explained away.   A common sense approach to crime means that, if we're going toaffect people's behavior, we must have a criminal justice system inwhich there is an expectation that, if you commit a crime, you willbe caught, and if caught, you will be prosecuted, and if convicted,you will do time.
