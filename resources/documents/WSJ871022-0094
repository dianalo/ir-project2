As fears of an economic recession gripped both the stock and bond markets this week, prices of many of these non-investment-grade, high-yielding securities plummeted four points, or $40 for each $1,000 face amount. During the same period, prices of some government issues have climbed about seven points.    While junk bond prices recovered some of their losses yesterday as the stock market rebounded, analysts and money managers are particularly scrutinizing the junk bonds of companies that did leveraged buy-outs over the past few months at the peak of stock-market values, and companies in consumer-oriented areas considered most vulnerable to recession.    Some companies issued such bonds to finance buy-outs, intending to pay back some of the debt by selling assets. But asset values then were far higher than they are now, and the principal and interest payments on many junk issues are dependent on such asset sales. Even after yesterday's record gain, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains 26% below its Aug. 25 high.    In addition, Ben Trosky, a high-yield bond manager at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., said, &quot;The retail sector has been under extreme pressure, as have some of the cyclicals and the airlines.&quot;    &quot;There seems to be a fair amount of selling of some of the retail-oriented issues for the obvious reason that people think consumer confidence and consumer spending will decline,&quot; said Jack Utter, portfolio manager at the IDS Extra Income fund, a high-yield bond fund.    During the first nine months of the year, junk bonds outperformed comparable Treasury bonds with a total return of 3.9% against a negative 6%, according to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. But since September, the junk market has deteriorated. By yesterday junk bonds' total return for the year was zero, against negative 4% for Treasury bonds.    On Sept. 4, for instance, a composite of about 55 junk bond issues showed a yield of 13.15%, or about 3.84 percentage points more than 10-year Treasury notes yielding 9.31%, according to Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. By yesterday, the spread between junk and Treasurys had widened to 5.79 percentage points.    Among the hard-hit issues is a $1.1 billion package of debt by Burlington Holdings Inc., which last month completed a leveraged buy-out of Burlington Industries Inc. Since last week, the price of 12-year bonds has dropped as low as 90 from 96. The bonds, issued at 100, recovered a couple of points yesterday.    &quot;Deals like Burlington where they have to make significant asset sales, and the sales are not completed yet, concern me a little more here,&quot; says James Caywood of Caywood Christian Capital Management in San Diego.    &quot;The clear problem is with deals dependent on large asset sales and rapid debt repayment schedules,&quot; agrees Robert Long, director of high-yield research at First Boston Corp. One analyst cited Borg-Warner Holdings Corp. as an example of a company with an ambitious repayment timetable. Borg-Warner's 10-year bonds dropped to a low price of 85 this week from 88 Friday. They were issued late July at 100.    Fruehauf Corp., which has about $900 million of debt outstanding, has been particularly buffeted by the stock market crash this week and by fears of a slower economy. In just one week, its junk bonds have tumbled to a price of 65 from 85 as concern mounted that the company may have difficulty making timely interest payments. The bonds were issued at 100 last year.    Yesterday, Fruehauf announced plans to sell several assets. However, Richard Bilotti, a bond analyst at L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co., said, &quot;I'd be surprised if the entire company is worth much more than $700 million.&quot;    Mr. Bilotti said the market weakness has generated much wider disparities in yields of bonds of different companies, depending on their reliance on asset sales. &quot;The crash in the stock market has reinvigorated credit analysis in the junk market,&quot; he added.    Among other junk bond issuers viewed with growing concern are airlines, such as Pan Am Corp., Trans World Airlines, Texas Air Corp. and its Eastern and Continental units; retailers, such as Allied Stores Corp., Supermarkets General Corp. and Macy Merger Corp.; homebuilders, such as Jim Walter Corp. and General Homes Corp. and other recent buy-outs such as Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.    One trader is betting on a decline in the shares of Tonka Corp. in light of its leveraged acquisition last week of Kenner Parker Toys Inc. for about $525 million. The purchase was financed mainly by a bank loan from First Chicago Corp. and a bridge loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. &quot;This was the very last deal before the deluge&quot; that began when stocks tumbled 508.00 points on Monday, he said.    But some money managers believe fundamentals haven't changed enough to warrant alarm. &quot;Everyone is taking one figure, a 500-point decline in the market, and extrapolating a recession,&quot; said one. Such skepticism about an imminent recession got a big boost from yesterday's strong stock market rebound.    Also, many junk bonds outside the consumer sector have rebounded from sharp losses this week. Phillips Petroleum Co. junk bonds, for instance, dropped to a low of 100 this week but rallied back to 105, the price quoted by dealers last week. &quot;This is a good example of junk bonds not dependent on asset sales or threatened particularly by recession,&quot; said Philip Maffei, an analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti andamp; Maffei Inc.    Junk bonds tend to perform somewhere in between the stock market and bond market. Like other bonds, they fall in value as interest rates rise, which is what happened most of this year. But they also tend to rise in price when stocks rise, as they did most of this year, because that boosts the chance issuers will make their payments. </TEXT></DOC>
