But the studies rule out chances that smoke from even atotal incineration of Kuwait's oil facilities would blot outthe sun and change the climate as far away as the U.S., assome scientists fear.</LP><TEXT>   The findings of the government, which secretly beganintensive studies on the topic late last year, lend credenceto the idea that Saddam Hussein could use oil as a weaponagainst U.S.-led forces. Although the unclassified sectionsof the reports didn't detail military consequences, theconclusions are certain to become a factor in war planning.   Separate studies for the Defense and Energy departmentsidentified varying worst-case environmental effects if theIraqi leader follows through on his threats to devastateKuwait's oil industry. A third study, done for the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found more limitedeffects, a spokesman said.   If all 363 of Kuwait's producing wells and all its storagetanks were set ablaze, it would produce 540,000 tons of smokeduring the first month in &quot;a massive and unprecedentedpollution event,&quot; according to a study for the Pentagon byPacific-Sierra Research Corp. The smoke would obscurevisibility locally and cause soot fallout and acid rain asfar away as Pakistan and India. Greasy black rain already hasbeen reported in Iran after isolated oil fires were set thisweek in Kuwait.   The oil well fires could rage for months, especially ifthe war continues and firefighting crews couldn't begin work.The study estimated that more than 80% of the smoke wouldhover no more than a mile above the ground, informationimportant to military planners who would have to cope withreduced visibility for pilots, satellites and certainweaponry.   As much as 4.8 billion barrels from Kuwait's 95 billionbarrels in proven reserves, the third-biggest in the world,could be lost through uncontrolled flow of oil and reducedpressure in the reserves, according to the study done for theEnergy Department. The reserves won't burn, though, becausethere's no oxygen underground to feed a fire, industryexperts say.   The report identified even more serious environmentalproblems from a major oil spill. The report estimated Iraqcan unleash an oil spill of at least 20 million barrels -- 80times more than the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska -- into theshallow and enclosed Persian Gulf.   A summary of the study said a massive oil spill would&quot;cause major damage to marine ecology, and to the fishingindustry in the region.&quot; Desalination plants in the region,which supply more than half the drinking water, &quot;could beseriously affected,&quot; it said.   The three government studies rebutted more-catastrophicclaims by Carl Sagan and other prominent scientists.</TEXT></DOC>
