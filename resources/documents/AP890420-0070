Unrest was reported in villages near Kerak and south of the DeadSea, the latest violence in a wave of rioting that has left atleast seven people dead.   A local reporter said he saw soldiers fatally shoot at least oneperson and wound two people in Mazar, eight miles south of Kerak,when demostrations occurred during a funeral today for a youthslain on Wednesday.   Family members identified the person killed today as YacoubKatawneh, a cousin of the slain youth, 13-year-old Ibrahim Katawneh.   The reporter said a local official in Mazar on Wednesday shotthe youth and an air force major as a demonstration passed theofficial's house. But authorities in Amman suggested the shootingmight have been a personal matter unrelated to the current unrest.   The two deaths near Kerak, 50 miles south of Amman, were inaddition to five deaths reported Wednesday in Ma`an, 120 milessouth of Amman.   Ma`an, where the disturbances first broke out Tuesday, remainedunder curfew and was blockaded by the army, residents said.   Other riots were reported in villages north of Kerak and at GhorEs-Safi south of the Dead Sea. There were no confirmed reports ofcasualties.   The government deployed troops on roads around populationcenters throughout southern Jordan.   Information Minister Hani Khasawneh told The Associated Presstoday the riots were ``not a serious security threat,'' and saidthe government had acted ``in full realization of the patriotism ofour people.''   He said security agencies ``have been inquiring into theseincidents, especially the looting and setting fire to governmentbuildings, and the false phone contacts ... with foreign pressagencies.''   The disturbances that broke out Tuesday in Ma`an apparently weretriggered by government-imposed increases in the prices ofgasoline, cigarettes and other items. The increases were announcedSunday as part of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund.   The price increases came on the heels of an economic slide thathas sent per capita income tumbling to about $1,200 a year fromnearly $2,000 in the mid-1980s.   In Washington, King Hussein told reporters Wednesday, ``Ibelieve everything is under control.''   The official Jordan News Agency reported today that Crown PrinceHassan, the king's brother, responded to the incidents by callingfor a conference to study the country's development needs.   Yousef Azem, who represented maan in Jordan's now-suspendedParliament, said leaders of the Maan region met in Amman onWednesday. He said they decided to seek calm in the region and toprepare a list of demands to give the government.   Hussein said the disturbances resulted from ``measures that hadto be taken as a result of the defaulting of several Arab states inhelping us'' _ a reference to the failure of Arab oil states tomeet a $1 billion yearly commitment to the kingdom agreed upon in1978. We had to take some measures and obviously people feel them.''   The price increases announced Sunday raised gasoline prices by25 percent to $1.65 a gallon, and raised the cost of cigarettes,telephone calls, heating oil and cooking gas by 10 percent to 50percent.   Prices of other commodities also have risen sharply the pastyear because of a devaluation of the Jordanian dinar on worldmarkets.   But local incomes have remained stable, often at about $175 to$275 monthly. An economic slowdown has caused unemployment to riseto as high as 20 percent by some estimates.   Rioters in Ma`an, Kerak and other cities have stoned police,burned official cars and attacked banks, government offices andshops with stones and fire.</TEXT></DOC>
