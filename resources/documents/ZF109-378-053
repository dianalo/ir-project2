(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>For most of the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, corporate executives marveledat the returns their investments in computers gave their enterprises.andO;Outlays for hardware and software quickly paid for themselves as informationsystems automated basic functions such as accounting, inventory control andpayroll.andM;As the 1980s progressed, however, awe of is turned to scrutiny.andP;  No wonder:the cost of building and maintaining the complex infrastructures of systems,applications and networks had risen to 15% of operating expenses in certainindustries and soaked up as much as 70% of profits in others.andP;  And manyexecutives were hard put to find any measurable productivity gains as aresult of such massive is investments.andM;In the 1990s a new force, namely the chief executive officer, must takecharge of is lest companies abandon the very foundation-informationtechnology for much of their success.andP;  In these times, CEOs must claim is asa strategic part of their companies' business, as executives at AMR Corp.,andO;Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co. and other notable is users have done.andM;Before CEOs can lay claim to is, however, they must regard it in the rightlight.andP;  Today, the typical CEO sees the mainframes, minicomputers, terminalsand software webbed throughout his or her business as arcane, proprietarytechnology developed by specialists.andP;  Tomorrow, the successful CEO must seeis as part and parcel of the business itself, built with commonplacetechnology like desk-top systems and local area networks that allowapplications to be developed by decision makers themselves.andM;With this vision, the CEOs can change is from an administrative tool into astrategic tool by: * Improving the information content of their business byapproving only is investments that directly support the company's businessstrategy.andP;  * Using information technology most effectively by reducing thedistance between information generators and information users.andP;  *andO;Guaranteeing superior delivery of information by developing and rewardinginternal and external is staffers who not only support the company's businessstrategy but help change it in  wa s that realize much more of the potentialof information technology than is currently being tapped.andM;How an organization uses this tool, once transformed, may well determine thesuccess of the corporation in the 1990s.andP;  That's why so many CEOs today arespending time with their chief information officers, vice presidents ofinformation systems and their staffs, reviewing plans to execute is-intensivebusiness strategies in the decade ahead.andP;  Be Careful Where You investandM;Today, many IS efforts  dollars, equipment and human resources) aremisplaced.andP;  They're aimed at maintaining or updating existing applications orcapturing the few remaining incremental improvements that earlier automationinitiatives overlooked.andP;  This state of is affairs leaves in-house softwaredevelopment teams and their leaders with little time to respond to requestsfrom users for new applications.andP;  In several companies McKinsey andamp; Co. serves,only 7 to 10% of the is staff time is available to develop new applications,and the dominant time is spent maintaining old applications.andM;Some user organizations, of course, stand above the rest by choosing todevote greater is resources to new applications than to old ones.andP;  Aetna, forexample, has increased business in its insurance agencies by some 15% sinceintroducing its GEMINI system.andP;  GEMINI eases an insurance agent's work loadwhen writing an Aetna policy by linking the agent directly with the insurer'scomputers at headquarters in Hartford, Conn.andP;  Equally impressive are thegains made by Tenneco Inc. with its Tennspeed system, a PC- andmainframe-based system that allows customers of the natural gas company toreserve space for shipping gas through its pipelines.andP;  The Houston-basedcompany introduced the system in 1988-early enough to establish itself as acustomer-focused leader in the eyes of end users as the natural gas industrywas deregulated.andP;  Resulting gains in market share have allowed Tenneco toincrease the volume of gas going through its pipeline by 30%.andP;  Keep an Eye onthe VisionandM;Leaders in companies like these understand that it's their job to articulateclear strategic visions for their enterprises and to stipulate how IS canhelp implement those visions.andP;  These leaders don't just sign off on isprojects.andP;  Working with their internal is counterparts, outside serviceproviders and business users, they set criteria for is-intensive projects andhold accountable the business units developing such projects.andM;IS guidelines are a logical extension of top management's traditional role ofsetting business strategy and objectives.andP;  By setting such guidelines, a CEOcan bridge the gap between business goals that seem almost unobtainable andthe systems that can allow the goals to be met.andP;  But CEOs needn't go so faras to provide the actual technical advice for implementing the systems.andP;  Allthey must do is clearly and completely outline the company's businessobjectives.andM;Don McWhorter, chairman of Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, for example,wanted a customer to be able to call any department in his bank to find outthe status of savings, checking or other accounts.andP;  So McWhorter developed isguidelines specifying that front-line personnel (tellers, loan managers,etc.) at the bank must have access to all customer account information andthat such information must be available within two seconds.andP;  Based on theseguidelines, business analysts and programmers developed a system thataccomplished exactly what McWhorter had in mind.andP;  The best CEO-directed isguidelines extend well beyond specific projects.andP;  They address the process ofmaking sure that organizational capabilities match IS potential, as well.andO;Mastery of this process is a hallmark of companies renowned for achievingexcellence in managing IS, companies like AMR and Baxter Healthcare Corp.andO;Such companies continually distinguish themselves from typical organizationsby consistently tracking new technologies and effectively incorporating theminto the business.andP;  Insist on Economic BenefitsandM;Words alone, of course, aren't enough to execute an is strategy.andP;  CEOs haveto be prepared to finance it.andP;  And if they are smart, they should insist thatall of a company's IS expenditures yield explicit and measurable economicbenefits over the lifetime of projects.andM;The business benefits of any significant is project can be determined throughinformation value analysis.andP;  Such a process evaluates whether the changes inbusiness practices that result from an IS investment justify the expense.andM;Besides evaluating the worth of individual is projects, companies shouldconduct systems value analysis every two or three years on a much broaderscale-measuring the worth of all IS projects, past and present, that formtheir current information-processing infrastructures.andP;  Such a broadevaluation should be done in three steps : First, a company should separateout its interconnected enterprisewide systems into their separate components.andO;Then it should look for opportunities to limit planned systems investments toonly those that will pay for themselves in six to 12 months.andM;Second, the company should analyze all new development projects with an eyetoward reallocating resources to those projects which will have the highestimpact on the organization.andP;  Finally, the company should make any changes toits IS organization that are needed to ensure lasting improvements.andM;CEOs only too well about difficulties that their is organizations havebringing large scale systems projects in on time, within budget and atpromised performance levels.andP;  What may be hidden from them, however, is thereal reason for such problems in many cases-the barrier that exists betweencentralized is organizations and information users on the front lines ofbusiness.andM;Companies with repeated is successes, for the most part, have reduced thedistance between generators and users of information in two ways.andP;  One is byinvesting front-line decision makers and the is teams supporting them withmuch more authority for information technology expenditures.andP;  Another is bypromoting frequent interaction between programmers and end users duringapplications development.andP;  The CEO's role at such a company is to make surethe gap is narrowed in these ways.andP;  What the IS Staff Should DoandM;Coincident with the shift in is authority to business units is the physicaltransfer of key applications development staff to those units.andP;  Puttingapplications development organizationally and physically close to users ismuch more likely to optimize innovation and effectiveness, even if sometradeoffs in efficiency occur.andM;More and more companies are decentralizing their applications developmentstaffs, including Bankers Trust Corp., Mobil Corp. and the United StatesAutomobile Association (USAA).andP;  At New York City-based Bankers Trust, forexample, developers assigned directly to the product line organization haveallowed the bank to consistently introduce securities trading floorapplications more rapidly than competitors.andP;  That, in turn, has bolstered CEOCharles Sanford's ability to transform the bank into a merchant-bankingoriented institution.andM;It is now both technically feasible and organizationally necessary for theCEO to encourage decentralization of hardware resources.andP;  One company that'sdone so is insurer AMEX Life Assurance Co. in San Rafael, Calif.andP;  It ispiloting an approach to switch from an IBM-based mainframe to a VAX- andMacintosh-based configuration for its main life insurance systems to give endusers access to more computing power.andP;  The result should be better customerservice and lower delivery costs, helping the company to improve its returnon equity.andM;Quantum improvements in the price and performance of distributed hardwareplatforms such as personal computers, workstations and servers make itincreasingly hard to justify a large centralized is operation.andP;  But not allis resources must or should be decentralized.andP;  It remains logical tocentralize functions with economies of scale and those that are learningintensive, like some types of transaction processing or project management.andO;*THE BEST CEODIRECTED IS GUIDELINES EXTEND WELL BEYOND SPECIFIC PROJECTS.andM;Of course, decentralization is not a panacea.andP;  It increases the risk that theintegrity of data may be compromised or security breached.andP;  The CEO'smanagement team must take steps to account that and also must make sure thatthe systems placed in business units are compatible-with each other as wellas with any centrally located systems.andP;  Pay Them Their IS WorthandM;Two key factors in making IT support a company's business strategy are thecompetence of the company's is staff and the willingness of the company's endusers to adapt their business practices to new technology-drivenopportunities.andP;  Neither factor should fie- taken for granted.andM;Competency is hard to come by.andP;  Today, the largest U.S.andP;  industrial andservice companies are enduring rapid turnover in their is ranks, when theycan least afford it.andP;  As a result, a broad gap exists between the skills ISprofessionals possess and the ones they need to keep their companies on theprofitable edge.andP;  They don't know enough about the businesses they're in, andthey can hardly keep up with technology advances like fourthgenerationlanguages.andM;To complicate matters, the industrial powers and service stars are alsohaving a hard time recruiting the best computer science graduates becausethey cannot match the salaries, opportunities for advancement and intriguingprojects of information technology suppliers such as Andersen Consulting, CapGemini Sogeti, Electronic Data Systems Corp. and Lotus Development Corp.andO;These is suppliers are siphoning off large numbers of candidates: EDS alonehires over 6,000 professionals a year.andM;What are CEOs of user organizations to do? The best are focusing theircompanies' resources and respect on pivotal is jobs, pursuing outsourcingalternatives and capturing the benefits of information technology investmentsby linking is support to business change.andM;Usually, professionals occupying the IS pivot points-project managers, systemarchitecture planners, sourcing managers who can help CEOs translate businessobjectives into reality-constitute only 10 to 15% of centralized isdepartments.andP;  Their jobs are critical for successful integration of is intobusiness strategy and are difficult to outsource.andM;CEOs must make sure that their companies provide their pivotal is playerswith opportunities to excel and with rewardsboth financial andorganizational-when they do.andP;  Many companies have created paths fordeveloping these individuals.andP;  Consumer goods giant Procter andamp; Gamble Co., forexample, hires key is employees from business and engineering schools,viewing them as internal consultants and critical members of their marketingteams.andP;  The career path is multidimensional.andP;  The Citibank division ofCiticorp rotates business managers through is positions to broadly distributeIS awareness and skills.andP;  Wall Street's Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Inc. has an is&quot;counter elite,&quot; who are compensated at levels on par with the investmentbankers and subject to the same up or out approach, rather than beingconsidered a separate function and relegated to second-class status.andM;Once pivotal individuals are identified and applications development staffare placed within business units, CEOs must decide what to do with theirremaining centralized systems.andP;  One compelling choice is to outsourcecommodity or utility is functions to third parties.andP;  Natural OutsourcesandM;Third-party service providers like EDS attract the best computer programmers.andO;They regularly review state-of-the-art technology.andP;  And they can spreadcomputer center management and industryspecific applications across a broadclient base.andP;  Such strengths often allow them to be able to developapplications more quickly and at lower costs than in-house is talent can.andM;Companies that have made effective use of third parties abound.andP;  Banc One hasentered into a joint venture with EDS and Andersen for its latest systems:Andersen is developing a credit-card processing system and EDS is developinga retail-banking operation.andP;  Eastman Kodak Co. in Rochester, N.Y., has hiredIBM and Digital Equipment Corp. to run its basic is operations.andP;  CumminsEngine Co. Inc. in Columbus, Ind., has a similar pact with EDS.andP;  Both MaxusEnergy Corp. of Dallas and Enron Corp. of Houston have farmed out theirinformation-processing operations while retaining their applicationsdevelopment capabilities, which are now focused on integrating generators andusers of information.andP;  CEOs must manage any significant is outsourcingaggressively.andP;  They should take great pains to make sure third-party serviceproviders clearly understand their vision for their company and the role ofis in that vision.andP;  CEOs have to define their expectations clearly toproviders and must monitor and assess progress made by them.andP;  Too many times,providers are allowed to operate with no controls, causing disappointmentswhen expectations are not met.andP;  Additionally, management must define what itexpects from its remaining internal is staff.andP;  Change End Users' AttitudesandM;The best effort by CEOs to decentralize their is resources into businessunits won't, of course, accomplish anything unless managers and end userswithin those units fully embrace the potential of information technology.andO;Too often, however, they refuse to change their business practices tocapitalize on technology-frequently out of ignorance of what systems can dofor them.andP;  Instead, they merely try to fit or adapt is to their currentbusiness system.andM;Individual IS projects should be led by people who can clearly articulate howthe project will support the company's strategy.andP;  The project leader must actas a change manager to ensure that end users capitalize on all isinvestments.andM;Project leaders, moreover, must act as coordinators-guiding is professionalsand end users along the same path and at the same pace.andP;  If is support getsahead of business change, potential remains unfulfilled.andP;  If business changegets ahead of is support, users get frustrated.andP;  Only with a coordinated,integrated program will results occur-as they have in the case of PepperidgeFarm Inc. The Norwalk, Conn.-based subsidiary of Campbell Soup Co. sought tocut the time from order to delivery of baked goods by giving handheldcomputers to distributors for order entry.andP;  Pepperidge Farm's project managerapproached the challenge by first setting up focus groups to help get majordistributors' input and cooperation before any systems were developed.andO;Throughout the project, the company tested various approaches with itsdistributors and its baking plants to ensure smooth transmission of data.andO;Take Charge of the ChallengeandM;As companies like Pepperidge Farm are finding, a new era of IS is dawning inwhich systems, software and communications are so intertwined with goods andservices as to make them indistinguishable.andP;  These companies havesuccessfully tied is investments to business strategies, integratedfront-line strategists with key IS programmers to develop winning systems andbuilt internal and external IS resources.andM;The CEO plays the critical role in bringing this new is fight to his or herorganizations.andP;  Without the chief's leadership and perseverance, thepotential of is to change a company for the better will rarely be realized.andO;For a company aspiring to make the leap from routine to innovative andcumulative use of information technology, the road ahead is long-requiringinventories of internal and external skills, software and hardware.andP;  TomTinsley is a director of McKinsey andamp; Co., a world-renowned managementconsulting firm headquartered in New York City.andP;  Tinsley works out ofMcKinsey's Dallas Office.andP;  Andrew C.
