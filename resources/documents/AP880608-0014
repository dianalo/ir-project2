The Occupational Safety and Health Administration on Tuesdayproposed cutting job exposure limits for 234 toxic chemicals andbringing 168 others under government regulation for the first time.   ``This is a 20-year technological leap that brings the country'sbasic occupational health regulations up to date,'' said OSHAAdministrator and Assistant Labor Secretary John A. Pendergrass.   Officials estimated that the new exposure ceilings will reducejob-related fatalities due to cancer, respiratory andcardiovascular ailments and liver and kidney diseases by 500 ayear. Illnesses will fall by an estimated 55,000 annually, theysaid.   Approximately 3.6 million workers are now exposed toconcentrations of the chemicals above the proposed new ceilings,OSHA officials said. They estimated the cost to industry of meetingthe new standards at $900 million a year.   Some of the most widely used chemicals for which exposure limitswould be reduced are choloroform, carbon monoxide, hydrogencyanide, ammonia and trichlorethylene.   Employers would have to meet the new standards six months afterthe final regulations are approved.   Pendergrass said approval of the regulations could come asearlier as November. But he acknowledged that business oppositionto many of the changes is likely to surface in hearings scheduledto begin next month or through court challenges later.   OSHA officials said immediate compliance with most of theproposed standards could be achieved through the use of personalrespirators. However, they added that the agency envisionsrequiring the adoption of more expensive engineering controls suchas ventilation systems within four years.   Pendergrass called the regulations ``the most significantworkplace exposure action taken by OSHA in its 17-year history.''   Union officials endorsed the goal but complained that theproposal requires no monitoring to assure that exposure ceilingsare not exceeded. They also noted that it excludes some toxicchemicals such as beryllium, chromates and silica.   ``We generally supported the project, but we're disappointed,''said Diane Factor, an industrial hygienist for the AFL-CIO. ``Tohave an exposure limit without a monitoring requirement is likeordering a 55 miles per hour speed limit without a speedometer.''   Ms. Factor said, however, it is unlikely that the AFL-CIO wouldchallenge the standards in court.   Randy Schumacher, director of health and safety for the ChemicalManufacturers Association, said his group supports OSHA's approachbut added he anticipates challenges from companies to some of thespecific limits.   ``This is a good one-time approach, but OSHA needs some kind ofmechanism that allows this to occur on a more routine basis,''Schumacher said.   The OSHA proposal sets exposure limits on a total of 428chemicals, including the 234 for which the current ceilings wouldbe dropped and the 168 coming under federal regulation for thefirst time.   Current exposure limits would be reaffirmed for 25 morechemicals, and a 10-fold increase in the exposure limit would beallowed for one _ fluorine _ based on recent data, the agency said.   OSHA has been criticized widely by both labor and management fornot having updated its exposure ceilings since the agency'screation in 1971. Its attempts on a substance-by-substanceapproach, such as with asbestos and benzene, have succeeded in only24 cases.   The agency estimates there are now more than 550,000 potentiallytoxic chemicals and chemical compounds in the workplace.   Most of the current federal exposure limits are based on``threshold values'' established in 1968 by the American Conferenceof Governmental Industrial Hygienists and adopted in 1971 by OSHAas federal standards.   Since then, the ACGIH and the National Institute forOccupational Safety and Health have updated the threshold values orrecommended exposure limits on many of the chemicals, but thechanges have not been reflected in OSHA regulations.   Pendergrass said most of the proposed new ceilings are based on1987-88 data provided by the ACGIH with backup from NIOSH, anagency of the Department of Health and Human Services.   NIOSH-recommended exposure limits are actually lower than theproposed new ceilings in many cases. But unlike the ACGIH and OSHA,NIOSH does not consider feasiblity in its recommendations onpermissible exposures, Pendergrass said.</TEXT></DOC>
