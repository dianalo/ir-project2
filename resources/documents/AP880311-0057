(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. Jerry Falwell says scandalsinvolving TV preachers Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart havestrengthened broadcast evangelism and made Christianity stronger,more mature and more committed.   Christian television ministries that put their financial anddoctrinal houses in order will survive and prosoper, Falwell toldthe National Association of Evangelicals on Thursday.   In five years, ``most of the evangelical ministers that areplaying on top of the table will be stronger than they are today,''the fundamentalist preacher said in his first appearance before thegroup, which represents 50,000 churches in 72 denominations.Falwell is not a member of the NAE.   ``You need not be embarrassed by what has happened ... just moresensitive,'' he told hundreds of applauding delegates. ``This is atime to regroup, judge ourselves and march on with a greaterintensity than before.   ``The cause of Christ is now better off'' because of Bakker andSwaggart's problems, Falwell said, comparing the scandals withWatergate and politics.   ``In the days ahead, it is going to be tougher for nationalleaders (of TV ministries) to misbehave,'' just as the Watergatecrisis resulted in governmental and political reforms, he said.   Bakker, who admitted a tryst with a church secretary and who hasbeen accused of financial improprieties, was expelled from theAssemblies of God church. After Bakker resigned as head of PTL,Falwell headed the ministry for several months before steppingaside.   Swaggart, who has been accused of paying a prostitute to performlewd acts, was suspended by the denomination and expects to returnto the pulpit.   The scandals have led to a new code of moral and financialethics for religious broadcasters.   ``I think the days of the Rolls Royces and Rolexes ... the daysin which social status is gauged by financial trappings are over,''said Falwell, whose ``Old Time Gospel Hour'' is broadcast worldwideon 350 television stations.   He said the Swaggart controversy had little effect on his ownministry, and he didn't believe that it had the more serious impactof the Bakker revelations on the religious broadcast industry.   However, he said that if the events surrounding Swaggart andBakker had involved him, Billy Graham or other more conservativeministers ``we would be out looking for other employment.''   ``I'd rather be dead'' than be immoral, said Falwell, a founderof the Moral Majority and pastor of the 21,000-member Thomas RoadBaptist Church in Lynchburg, Va.   Falwell praised former television evangelist Pat Robertson, butsaid he endorsed Vice President George Bush for the presidency eventhough Falwell advised President Reagan not choose Bush as his vicepresident.   The preacher said he would like to see U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp runfor vice president. The Republican New York congressman pulled outof the presidential race Thursday after a poor showing in primaryand caucus races.   Falwell is a registered Democrat, but said, ``I can't think of asingle Democrat running this year who I could hold my nose and votefor.''</TEXT></DOC>
