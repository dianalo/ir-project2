Accompanying events, however, raise some big doubts about how long this triumph might last. Initiatives for both military and economic reforms keep getting lost. Last Thursday her defense secretary, Rafael Ileto, resigned -- citing frustration in his efforts to reform the military.    The army still lacks a coherent strategy for fighting a growing insurgency of some 24,000 communist guerrillas. Nor is there any sign that even after five increasingly violent coup attempts Mrs. Aquino is seriously addressing the concerns of the military. Gen. Ileto said after resigning that during his 14-month tenure as defense secretary he'd submitted several plans for shaping up the armed forces. They'd all been ignored.    The economy also suffers. Shipping executives still complain about weeks of costly delays to comply with import regulations, for example. The state has yet to sell big businesses inherited from the Marcos administration, such as Philippines Airlines, the Philippine National Oil Co. and the Manila Hotel. There's also an unseemly reluctance on the part of the Aquino administration to tidy up the status of assets seized from Marcos cronies.    We keep hearing proposals to help the Philippines. Unfortunately, they mostly involve programs in which a government fighting a rear-guard action against waste and corruption would be entrusted with large sums of money. There's a land-reform package for which the Philippine government has been seeking hundreds of millions in funding. There's a Marshall Plan being championed by some U.S. politicians, such as Rep. Stephen Solarz. There's aid from Japan to &quot;recycle&quot; that infamous trade surplus. All these ideas may be well meant. None holds a solid answer.    Mrs. Aquino has achieved great things in bringing back free elections. Her early economic reforms, pushed through in good part by the late finance secretary, Jaime Ongpin, opened the economy enough to bring more than 5% growth in 1987. But for more than a year now, Mrs. Aquino has been letting slide the kind of policies that support democracy -- namely a minimal set of impartial rules, under which productive effort counts for more than political connections.    Instead, the heavy state hand in the Philippine economy sets up myriad tollgates through which transactions must pass. That's how corruption became a full-time occupation under Mr. Marcos. Were the Philippines today a free-market economy with far more limited scope for graft, it would be a lot less worrisome to see Mrs. Aquino linking up with the old Marcos machine. Instead, the president keeps listening to advisers with a vested interest in big government. The result is a demoralized population, more recruits for the communist New People's Army, a besieged and fractious military and a growing threat to the democracy for which Mrs. Aquino has sacrificed so much.    The good newes is that most Filipinos have shown again their dedication to democracy. Despite the campaign violence and communist threats, some 80% of the voters went to the polls. Moreover, Gen. Ileto, in tendering his resignation, has sounded a useful alarm about the continuing problems in the armed forces. Now that Mrs. Aquino has fulfilled her promise of delivering full democracy, we hope she'll take the next step of preserving it. </TEXT></DOC>
