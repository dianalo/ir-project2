SeesNarrower LossesAt Sprint Venture---By Janet GuyonStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/19/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> UT GTE TTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   GTE Corp. told analysts here that it expects losses at its US Sprint Communications Co. joint venture to continue shrinking, with the venture becoming profitable in next year's fourth quarter or early 1989.    As previously reported, pretax operating losses at the long-distance phone service venture narrowed to $166 million in the third quarter from $282 million in this year's second quarter. &quot;We expect that positive trend to continue,&quot; said Theodore Brophy, GTE's chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;We remain confident of the joint venture's long-term success.&quot;    US Sprint now is carrying 80% of its long-distance phone calls on its new fiberoptic network, Mr. Brophy said, and next year GTE expects that one major cost -- the expense of leasing phone lines -- should shrink to 4% of US Sprint's revenue. US Sprint is a joint venture of GTE and United Telecommunications Inc., Kansas City, Mo.    GTE shares were the most active on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, closing at $36, up $1, on volume of more than five million shares. United Telecommunications, also traded on the Big Board, closed at $25, up 75 cents.    Executives also said that although GTE expects slower U.S. economic growth next year than it did before the stock market crash, the Stamford, Conn., company hasn't changed its 1988 budgets.    Mr. Brophy said that GTE &quot;generally favors&quot; the Federal Communications Commission's proposal to replace profit regulation of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. with a cap on ATandamp;T's prices. Analysts believe the regulatory change will allow ATandamp;T to earn more, but it may also hurt competitors by allowing ATandamp;T to price more flexibly.    Mr. Brophy said GTE thinks that the FCC needs to set limitations on ATandamp;T's ability to target price reductions to certain customers, particularly businesses. ATandamp;T price cuts that are caused by reductions in ATandamp;T's costs to connect to local phone companies should be spread evenly between business and residential customers, he said. On Tuesday, ATandamp;T proposed an average price cut of 3.6% beginning Jan. 1, with cuts on services sold to businesses being larger than on those generally sold to residences.    Mr. Brophy, who is scheduled to retire next April, also said that GTE hopes that price cap regulation will also be applied to local phone companies. GTE is the largest local phone concern outside the Bell companies.    James L. &quot;Rocky&quot; Johnson, GTE's president, said that GTE expects its revenue from its cellular phone business to grow 30% this year and another 40% next year. The unit, which has 10 systems operating, is expected to become profitable next year, Mr. Johnson said. </TEXT></DOC>
