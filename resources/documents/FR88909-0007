This law stipulates that NHTSA can exempt those insurancecompanies whose market share is below certain percentages in each individualState and for the nation as a whole. To carry out these statutory provisions,the agency has exempted those insurance companies that are lawfully eligibleto be exempted and has also published a listing of those insurance companiessubject to the reporting requirements of Title VI of the Motor VehicleInformation and Cost Savings Act.The list of insurance companies required to file reports may differ annuallysince a company's eligibility for exemption from the reporting requirementsmay change, as its national and State-by-State market shares change. Toproperly address this situation, NHTSA publishes annual updates listingthe insurance companies that are required to file these reports each year.The updated list is based on the most current market share informationavailable to the agency.

Theterm ``insurer'' is defined very broadly for the purposes of section 612,which consists of two broad groups of entities. One of these groups isincluded in the definition of ``insurer'' by virtue of section 612(a)(3).That section specifies that, for the purposes of section 612, the term``insurer'' includes any person, other than a governmental entity, whohas a fleet of 20 or more motor vehicles used primarily for rental or leaseand are not covered by theft insurance policies issued by insurers of passengermotor vehicles. The requirements for this group of insurers are not addressedin or affected by this rule.The other broad group is included within the term ``insurer'' by virtueof section 2(12) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1901(12)). That section providesthat every person engaged in the business of issuing passenger motor vehicleinsurance policies is an insurer, regardless of the size of the business.Section 612(a)(5) provides that the agency shall exempt small insurersincluded in this second broad group from the reporting requirements ifNHTSA finds that such exemptions will not significantly affect the validityor usefulness of the information collected and compiled in the report,either nationally or on a State-by-State basis. The term ``small insurer''is defined in section 612(a)(5)(C) as an insurer whose premiums accountfor less than 1 percent of the total premiums for all forms of motor vehicleinsurance issued by insurers within the United States. However, that sectionalso stipulates that if an insurance company satisfies this defintion ofa ``small insurer,'' but accounts for 10 percent or more of the total premiumsfor all forms of motor vehicle insurance issued by insurers within a particularState, such an insurer must report the required information about its operationsin that State.To implement these statutory criteria for exempting small insurers, NHTSAhas used the data voluntarily supplied by insurance companies to A.M. Bestto determine the insurer's market shares nationally and in each State.The A.M. Best data base was chosen because it is both accurate and timely,and because its use imposes no additional burdens on any party.After examining the A.M. Best data, NHTSA determined that it should exemptall those insurance companies that were statutorily eligible for exemptionfrom these reporting requirements. This determination was based on twoseparate considerations. First, NHTSA determined that the reports fromonly those insurance companies that were statutorily required to file reportswould provide the agency with representative data, both nationally andon a State-by-State basis. Second, NHTSA determined that the report datato be provided by insurance companies who were ineligible for an exemptionwould be sufficient for NHTSA to carry out its activities and responsibilitiesunder Title VI of the Act.Accordingly, the agency included an Appendix A and an Appendix B in thefinal rule for insurer reports published January 2, 1987 (52 FR 59), andupdated these appendices annually. The 20 insurance companies listed inthe January 2, 1987, Appendix A had premiums that accounted for 1 percentor more of all motor vehicle insurance premiums paid nationally. Therefore,those companies were required to report on their operations for every Statein which they did business. The eleven insurance companies listed in theJanuary 2, 1987, Appendix B had premiums that accounted for 10 percentor more of the total motor vehicle insurance premiums within a particularState or States. Such companies were required to report on their operationsonly for those States in which their premiums accounted for 10 percentor more of the total premiums.The market shares for each of the insurance companies listed in the January2, 1987, final rule were derived from the A.M. Best data for 1984, themost recent year for which the A.M. Best data were available as of thedate the final rule was published. Since that time, A.M. Best data formore recent calendar years have become available. In its January 2, 1987,final rule, NHTSA stated that ``The agency will update these appendicesannually, shortly after A.M. Best publishes its revised listings, to reflectchanges in premium shares for the insurance companies'' (52 FR 62).Accordingly, the agency published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)on January 21, 1988, (53 FR 1641), proposing an updated listing of subjectinsurance companies that must provide annual insurer reports to the agencyfor the 1987 calendar year. That NPRM used the most current A.M. Best datato determine which insurance companies are statutorily required to filereports by October 25, 1988. That notice proposed that all insurance companiesthat were statutorily eligible for an exemption from these reporting requirementsshould be exempted.No comments were received on the proposed rule. For the reasons set forthabove and in the NPRM, this final rule adopts the proposed listings forboth Appendix A and Appendix B.This rule is effective 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> As noted earlier in this preamble, section 612of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2032) imposes a statutory duty on insurersthat were not exempted from these reporting requirements to file a reportfor the 1987 calendar year no later than October 25, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impacts</ITAG>1. Costs and Other ImpactsNHTSA has analyzed this rule and determined that it is neither ``major''within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 nor ``significant'' withinthe meaning of the Department of Transportation regulatory policies andprocedures. This final rule implements the agency's policy of ensuringthat all insurance companies that are statutorily eligible for exemptionfrom the insurer reporting requirements are in fact exempted from thoserequirements. On the other hand, those companies that are not statutorilyeligible for an exemption are expressly required to file reports.NHTSA does not believe that this rule, reflecting more current A.M. Bestdata, affects the impacts described in the final regulatory evaluationprepared for 49 CFR Part 544. Accordingly, a separate regulatory evaluationhas not been prepared for this rulemaking action. Using the cost estimatesin the final regulatory evaluation for Part 544, the agency estimates thatit will cost the five insurance companies added to Appendix A about $100,000each to file an initial report, while saving about $50,000 each for thethree companies deleted from Appendix A. The company that is deleted fromAppendix B will save about $20,000. Therefore, the net total impact ofthese changes is estimated to be a cost increase of approximately $330,000for insurance companies. This is well below the threshold of $100 millionfor classifying a rulemaking action as ``major'' under the Executive Order.As noted above, a full regulatory evaluation was prepared for the finalrule establishing 49 CFR Part 544. Interested persons may wish to examinethat evaluation in connection with this rule. Copies of that evaluationhave been placed in Docket No. T86-01; Notice 2. Any interested personmay obtain a copy of this evaluation by writing to NHTSA, Docket Section,Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590, or by callingat (202) 366-4949.2. Paperwork Reduction ActThe information collection requirements in this rule have been submittedto and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant tothe requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>.). These requirements have been approved through July 31,1990 (OMB approval number 2127-0547).3. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe agency has also considered the effects of this rulemaking under theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>.). Section 612(a)(5)(C) defines ``small insurer'' in partas any insurer whose premiums for motor vehicle insurance account for lessthan one percent of the total premiums for all forms of motor vehicle insuranceissued by insurers within the United States, or any insurer whose premiumswithin any State, account for less than 10 percent of the total premiumsfor all forms of motor vehicle insurance issued by insurers within theState. None of the 27 companies listed in Appendices A or B is a self-insuredmotor vehicle rental or leasing company and all these companies exceedthe ``small insurer'' standards outlined in section 612(a)(5)(C). Therefore,I certify that the final rule will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.4. FederalismThis action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that thefinal rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrantthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment.5. Environmental ImpactsIn accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, NHTSA has consideredthe environmental impacts of this rule and determined that it will nothave a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 544</ITAG>Crime insurance, Insurance, Insurance companies, Motor vehicles, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements.In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR Part 544 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 544_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
