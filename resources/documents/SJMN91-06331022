Hechallenged Lehder to identify those Contras who supposedly received the cash.;  Lehder previously testified that the cartel paid Noriega to ship cocainethough Panama from 1982 to 1984.;   Lehder returned to the stand today at theformer Panamanian dictator's trial on drug-trafficking charges carrying up to140 years in prison.;   Federal prosecutor Guy Lewis drew from Lehder that hewas cooperating in an ongoing investigation of top Cuban officials linked todrug trafficking.;   Lehder said he had met with Raul Castro, the brother ofCuban President Fidel Castro, and with fugitive U.S. financier Robert Vesco inhis travels to Cuba to seek permission to ship drugs through the islandnation.;   The witness' comments about the Contras came on cross-examinationby the defense, which contends that Central American drug trafficking wasauthorized by the United States to aid the anti-Sandinista rebels inNicaragua.;   &quot;To the best of my knowledge, there was some contribution to theContra anti-communist movement,&quot; he testified. &quot;It could be around $10million.&quot;;   Defense attorney Frank Rubino asked if the money was in exchangefor a U.S. &quot;green light&quot; to ship drugs to the United States through Contrabases in Costa Rica.;   &quot;I don't recall any of that, sir,&quot; Lehder answered. &quot;Ido recall that there were shipments going through Costa Rica.&quot;;   In a 1990interview in prison, Lehder said the drugs flew through a Costa Rican ranchowned by American John Hull, now a fugitive charged with murder in thatcountry. Hull was a major supporter of the Contras in the mid-1980s, using hisranch to fly U.S.-supplied weapons and equipment to them.;   But Lehder saidon the stand that he had only &quot;secondhand information&quot; about Hull'sinvolvement.;   The defense also asked Lehder, who is serving a sentence oflife without parole plus 135 years, if he had told others he expected to besent back to Colombia in exchange for testifying against Noriega.;   Lehderdenied it, but the defense confronted him with a note he wrote to a fellowinmate in which he said he eventually expected to be deported to his homeland.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Miami  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911126  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  497  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, November 26, 199100331022,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
