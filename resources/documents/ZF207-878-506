(Perspective) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Shumate, Paul W. Jr.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Fiber optic technology may become a cost effective way of bringingtelecommunications services into the home much sooner thanexpected, according to a study conducted under the auspices ofBell Communications Research Inc. Current estimates are thatfiber-to-the-home installations will increase to several millionby the year 2000 and reach 99 percent penetration by 2025.andO;Bellcore estimates that it currently costs about $3,000 per lineto install narrowband fiber in today's conventional digital loopcarrier double-star architecture.andP;  This cost could drop to $1,500by the mid-1990s.andP;  As growth increases cost effectiveness, it maybe feasible to use fiber for telephone service alone.andP;  Thecumulative cost of converting today's copper-loop network tobroadband fiber will total about $230 billion.andP;  The change shouldhave an impact on the planning of both vendors and theircustomers.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Bellcore Bell Communications Research Inc.
