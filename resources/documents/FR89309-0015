The cross-interest policyessentially prevents individuals or entities from having ``meaningful''relationships in two competing media outlets serving the same area. Themeaningful relationships which have been considered by the Commission tobe encompassed by this policy include: (1) Consulting positions; (2) jointventures; (3) time brokerage arrangements; (4) advertising agencies; (5)nonattributable equity interests; and (6) key employee relationships. Thecross interest policy was originally developed as a supplement to the Commission'sduopoly rule and, in later years, was extended through case-by-case adjudicationas a corollary to the Commission's other ownership rules. Like these rules,the cross-interest policy was aimed at ensuring the public's access toa diversity of viewpoints and at preventing undue concentration of economicpower in broadcast licensees.The Commission believes, for a variety of reasons, that the cross-interestpolicy, as it has applied to consulting positions, time brokerage arrangementsand advertising agency relationships, is not longer essential to maximizediversity of viewpoints or to prevent undue concentration of economic powerin broadcast markets. First, the substantial growth of media outlets acrossmarkets of all sizes has vastly emeliorated diversity concerns. Second,the new attribution provisions in the ownership rules amply define thoserelationships which create program and economic diversity concerns andthose which do not. In many respects, these new rules duplicate, or aremore extensive than the cross-interest policy, thereby rendering it superfluous.Third, other legal remedies exist that reduce or deter potential anticompetitiveconsequences which the cross-interest policy is designed to curb. Finally,our analysis indicates that the cross-interest policy imposes costs andburdens on the public, as well as the Commission, that are especially difficultto justify given the reduced need for the policy. At the same time thatthe Commission issues this decision reducing the scope of the cross-interestpolicy, it is also issuing a separate <T3>Further Notice of Inquiry/Notice of Proposed Rulemaking </T3>invitingfurther comment for a more extensive record before determining whetherto eliminate the cross-interest policy as it applies to key employees,certain nonattributable equity interests and joint ventures. Thus, untilthis proceeding is completed, the cross-interest policy remains in effectas it applies to these relationships.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>April 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Federal Communication Commission, Washington, DC 20554.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Douglas Minster, Mass Media Bureau,Policy and Rules Division, (202) 632-7792.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">47 CFR Part 73</ITAG>Radio broadcasting, Television broadcasting.<ITAG tagnum="84">47 CFR Part 76</ITAG>Cable television.<ITAG tagnum="20">Federal Communications Commission, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donna R.

On May 14, 1987, we instituted a <T3>Notice of Inquiry</T3> (<T3>Notice</T3>) into the cross-interest policy, which essentially preventsindividuals or entities from having ``meaningful'' cross-interests in twobroadcast stations, or a daily newspaper and a broadcast station, or acable television system and a television broadcast station, serving substantiallythe same area.\1\<NOTE/> As a result of our comprehensive review of the cross-interestpolicy, we are today issuing this Policy Statement reducing the scope andapplicability of that policy. A careful review of the record, our considerableregulatory experience in administering this policy, and our analysis ofthe public interest costs and benefits, convince us that continued reviewof many relationships within the cross-interest policy can no longer bejustified as a matter of sound policy. Because issues remain with respectto the policy as it applies to key employee relationships, certain nonattributableequity interests and certain joint ventures, we are issuing a <T3>Further Notice of Inquiry/Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</T3> requestingadditional comment on those matters.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>Reexamination of the Commission's Cross-Interest Policy</T3>, 2 FCCRcd 3699 (1987).Purpose and Scope of Inquiry 2. In the <T3>Notice </T3>in this proceeding, we sought comment on the possible eliminationof the cross-interest policy.\2\<NOTE/> Based on our experience in applying the policy and the developmentsin the communications marketplace, we expressed skepticism that the cross-interestpolicy, as applied on an <T3>ad hoc </T3>adjudicatory basis, continued to serve the public interest.Our <T3>Notice </T3>solicited comment on whether retention of the cross-interestpolicy is necessary to prevent anticompetitive abuses from occurring, whetheralternative policing mechanisms exist to assure competition, and whethercontinued regulation of relationships not specifically addressed by theCommission's rules is necessary. More specifically, we requested commentersto discuss the role of market forces, private remedies, and the antitrustlaws to deter anticompetitive misconduct and to ensure competitive communicationsmarkets. In addition, we asked whether we should amend our attributionrules to include key employees. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 3702.3. In the <T3>Notice,</T3> we identified certain relationships to be within the ambitof the cross-interest policy. These relationships involve key employees,consulting positions, advertising agency representative relationships,time brokerage arrangements, sales representative relationships, nonattributableequity interests, and joint ventures. We observed that the concerns relatingto certain cross-interest relationships had either been eliminated or specificallyaddressed by the Commission's rules. In particular, we noted that salesrepresentative relationships had been stricken from the cross-interestpolicy because we found the examination of such relationships unnecessaryto promote economic competition and that, to the extent that abuses arose,they could be addressed more adequately by remedies other than regulatoryintervention. We further noted that certain minority stock interests andpositional interests, such as officers and directors, were now encompassedby the local ownership rules and, therefore, the need to address theseinterests in the context of our existing cross-interest policy was unnecessary.Accordingly, based upon the considerations described above, we proposedto eliminate most of the remainder of the existing policy. 4. We conclude that retention of our policies relating to consulting positions,advertising agency representative relationships and time brokerage arrangementsare no longer warranted in the public interest.\3\<NOTE/> Before discussing the reasons for this determination, weshall initially describe the different types of cross-interests addressedin this <T3>Policy Statement </T3>which have created regulatory concern under ourexisting policy, provide an overview of the policy's evolution, and summarizethe comments filed in this proceeding. We shall then focus our attentionon the reasons which, considered together, persuade us that these partsof our cross-interest policy are no longer essential to promote economiccompetition or diversity of viewpoint or otherwise necessary to serve thepublic interest. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ As indicated above, our inquiry also included examinationof our cross-interest policy as it relates to joint ventures, key employeerelationships, and nonattributable equity interests. In order to developa fuller record, however, we are issuing a separate notice requesting additionalcomment on these issues. Background <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Cross-Interests Proscribed Under Policy </ITAG>5. The cross-interest policy is designed to address instances in whichan individual or entity has a ``meaningful'' relationship in two competingmedia outlets serving substantially the same area. The meaningful relationshipswhich the Commission has determined to be encompassed under the policyare set forth below.\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ In addition to determining what constitutes a ``meaningful''cross-interest, it is also necessary to ascertain when media outlets servesubstantially the same area. Generally, the policy applies to stationsor media outlets located in the same community or substantially in thesame market. <T3>See, e.g., Farmville Broadcasting Co., </T3>47 FCC 2d 463, 464 (1974);<T3>Guy S. Erway, </T3>90 FCC 2d 750, 752 (Rev. Bd. 1980). The cross-interestpolicy has not been applied, however, in situations that merely involvea minimal overlap of the 1 mV/m contours of the stations because such stationsare not considered to be in the same market. <T3>See, e.g., United Community Enterprises, Inc., </T3>37 FCC 2d 953 (Rev.Bd. 1972). 6. <T3>Consulting Positions. </T3>The Review Board has applied the cross-interestpolicy where a consultant who provides advice and/or has what would nowbe an attributable interest in one media outlet in the market also providesadvice to other competing stations in the same market.\5\<NOTE/> For example, the policy was applied where a spouse of thesole owner of one radio station was to serve as an accountant/bookkeeperor program director for that station as well as serve in a consulting capacityfor competing radio stations in the same market. The Review Board reasonedthat the consultant had access to confidential finanical or programminginformation of competitors and, therefore, had the potential to impairarms-length competition.\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Consultants, as distinguished from key employees, usuallyinvolve relationships with the licensee that are limited in duration andscope and generally confined to providing advice, which can either be acceptedor rejected by the licensee. In general, consultants are not considered,and hence do not serve, as ``employees'' of the licensee but rather asindependent contractors who are hired for their expertise in one or a numberof areas. For example, a consultant may be hired to prepare audience surveysand, based on these surveys, report findings and recommend a course, ofaction. Thus, while consultants may be engaged by licensees to make findingsand recommendations regarding aspects of a station's management, operationsor direction, they would not have the final say as to whether the recommendationsshould be implemented. Rather, such matters would usually be undertakenby officers or directors of the licensee. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See, e.g., Lexington County Broadcasters, Inc., </T3>42 FCC 2d 581(Rev. Bd. 1973); <T3>Guy S. Erway, </T3>90 FCC 2d at 750. 7. <T3>Time Brokerage Arrangements. </T3>The cross-interest policy has alsobeen considered in instances where a radio station proposes to enter intoa ``time brokerage'' arrangement to purchase varying amounts of time froma competing station in the same market in order to air programming andsell advertising during those segments. Generally, the Commission has foundthat such proposals implicate the cross-interest policy because of thepotential for diminution of competition arising from owning and programmingone station and making programming decisions at an independently-ownedstation.\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>WCVL, Inc., </T3>55 FCC 2d 879 (1975); <T3>Station WWSM, </T3>31 FCC 2d 584 (1971). 8. <T3>Advertising agencies. </T3>The cross-interest policy is also triggeredwhen an individual has ownership interests in both a broadcast stationand an advertising agency, and the ad agency purchases advertising timeon behalf of its clients on other stations in the same service in the samemarket as the commonly owned station. In these instances, the Commissionreasoned that the ad agency may be in a position to favor the commonly-ownedstation as against competing stations in the placement of advertising.In the past, hearings were held to determine whether such cross-interestsimplicated the policy.\8\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>Eastern Broadcasting Corp., </T3>30 FCC 2d 745 (Rev. Bd. 1971) (specificallegations of fact were sufficient to raise questions as to whether applicant'sinterest in an advertising agency and proposed broadcast station servingthe same area were contrary to the public interest). <T3>Cf. Atlantic Broadcasting Co. (WUST), </T3>5 FCC 2d 717 (1966) (cross-interestissue not warranted because of absence of specific allegations of factthat the interest would be contrary to the public interest).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Development of the Cross-Interest Policy  </ITAG>9. The cross-interest policy has evolved almost entirely through case-by-caseadjudication. The cross-interest policy was developed in the 1940's asa supplement to the ``duopoly'' rule, which then prohibited the commonownership, operation, or control of two stations in the same broadcastservice covering substantially the same area.\9\<NOTE/> At that time, either actual working control or ownershipof fifty percent or more of the stock of the licensee were necessary tomeet the ``ownership, operation or control'' requirement of the ``duopoly''rule.\1\\0\<NOTE/> This phrase, therefore, did not encompass minority stockinterests or positional interests such as being an officer, a directoror a manager.\1\\1\<NOTE/> Thus, situations in which the owner of one station obtainedan interest in another station in the same area through a position as anofficer, director, manager or minority stockholder were not prohibitedby the ``duopoly'' rule then in effect. Even though these cross-interestswere not covered by the ``duopoly'' rule, they were perceived to createthe same kind of anticompetitive concerns addressed by the rule. To addressthese concerns, the Commission applied a policy which went beyond the scopeof the ``duopoly'' rule by limiting ``cross-interests'' in more than onebroadcast service covering substantially the same area.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The ``duopoly'' rule currently prohibits the common ownership,operation, or control of two commercial broadcast stations in the samebroadcast service which serve the same local area. It accomplishes thisgoal by prohibiting the overlap of the 3.16 mV/m contours of commonly-ownedFM stations, the 5 mV/m contours of commonly-owned AM stations, or theGrade B contours of commonly-owned television stations. <T3>See</T3> 47 CFR 73.3555(a) (1986). The ``duopoly'' rule, as well asthe one-to-a-market rule (47 CFR 73.3555(b) (1987)), <T3>see infra</T3> note 19, have recently been reexamined in a separateproceeding. <T3>See Amendment of andSection;73.3555 of the Commission's Rules, the BroadcastMultiple Ownership Rules,</T3> <T2>XX</T2> FCC Rcd <T2>XX</T2> (1988) <T3>(First Report and Order</T3> in MM Docket No. 87-7, adopted October27, 1988) (Radio Duopoly Rule). <T3>Amendment of andSection;73.3555 of the Commission's Rules, the BroadcastMultiple Ownership Rules, </T3><T2>XX</T2> FCC Rcd <T2>XX</T2> (1988) (<T3>Second Report and Order</T3> in MM Docket No. 87-7, adopted December12, 1988) (One-to-a-Market-rule).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ <T3>Rules Governing Standard and High Frequency Broadcast Stations,</T3>5 Fed.

One of the earliest cases where this new policy was applied involvedan entity which had a controlling interest in one television station anda minority stock interest at another television station in the same community.\1\\2\<NOTE/> In a similar vein, this policy was invoked by the Commissionwhere principals proposed to be officers or directors of competing stationsin the same market.\1\\3\<NOTE/> In both instances, the Commission noted that the underlyingpurpose served was to promote and maintain full competition between stationslocated in the same city.\1\\4\<NOTE/> Further, the Commission indicated that prevention, not correction,of anticompetitive practices was the goal sought. In subsequent decisions,the Commission expanded the purpose underlying the cross-interest policybeyond its original intent by stating that it was designed to restrictnot only those relationships having the potential to threaten economiccompetition but also those having the potential to lessen diversity ofviewpoint.\1\\5\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ <T3>See Minnesota Broadcasting Corp.,</T3> 13 FCC 672 (1949). <T3>See also Macon Broadcasting Co.,</T3> 10 FCC 444 (1945), in which theCommission conditioned its grant of a construction permit for a new AMstation upon the applicant's two majority shareholders divesting themselvesof ``any connection'' with a competing AM station in the same community.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ <T3>Shenandoah Life Insurance Co.,</T3> 19 RR 1 (1959). The cross-interestsaddressed in both <T3>Minnesota Broadcasting </T3>and<T3> Shenandoah Life Insurance</T3> are now prohibited by our local ownershiprules.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 2.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ <T3>Compare Minnesota Broadcasting Corp.,</T3> 13 FCC at 672 (singularpurpose of economic competition) <T3>with United Community Enterprises, Inc.,</T3> 37 FCC 2d at 953 (dualpurpose of economic competition and diversity of viewpoint).  11. In an effort to promote the dual goals of competition and diversity,the cross-interest policy was invoked, in 1969, to prohibit a nationalor regional sales representative company that was wholly or partially ownedby a licensee of a broadcast station from representing and soliciting advertisingfor competing stations in the same service in the same area.\1\\6\<NOTE/> This policy known as the <T3>Golden West</T3> policy, was based upon the concern that such a ``salesrep'' could impair competition by colluding or price fixing in the saleof advertising time, or placing the station it did not own at a competitivedisadvantage. The Commission also expressed concern that this type of relationshipwas antithetical to the promotion of diversity of viewpoint. In 1981, theCommission instituted a rulemaking proceeding in which it questioned theregulatory wisdom underlying the <T3>Golden West</T3> policy. Finding that limiting these types of relationshipsdid not appear necessary to further the goals of promoting diversity ofviewpoint or economic competition, the Commission eliminated the policy.\1\\7\<NOTE/> The Commission concluded that the operation of market forcesand application of the antitrust laws would be adequate to deter anticompetitivepractices that the policy sought to address.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\<T3>Golden West Broadcasters,</T3> 16 FCC 2d 918 (1969).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\<T3>Golden West Policy,</T3> 87 FCC 2d 668 (1981) (Report and Order inBC Docket No. 80-438).12. Although the cross-interest policy was originally developed as an intra-servicesupplement to the duopoly rule, it was subsequently extended to the Commission'sother local ownership rules,\1\\8\<NOTE/> including the broadcast one-to-a-market rule,\1\\9\<NOTE/> and the broadcast/newspaper \2\\0\<NOTE/> and cable/television cross-ownership rules.\2\\1\<NOTE/> Subsequent case-by-case adjudications, under the cross-interestpolicy, have resulted in creation of additional restraints beyond thoseexpressly prohibited by the local ownership rules.\2\\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\These rules, described below, including the duopolyrule, will be collectively referred to hereinafter as ``the local ownershiprules.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\<T3>See, e.g., Cleveland Television Corp., </T3>91 FCC 2d 1129 (Rev.

Unlike the``duopoly'' rule, the ``one-to-a-market'' rule restricts common ownershipbetween commercial stations in different broadcast services. In essence,it restricts a party to one AM-FM combination or one television stationin a market. <T3>See </T3>47 CFR 73.3555(b) (1986). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\The broadcast/newspaper cross-ownership rule prohibitscommon interests in a broadcast station and a daily newspaper if the broadcaststation's relevant service contour would encompass the entire communityin which such newspaper is published. <T3>See </T3>47 CFR 73.3555(c) (1986). <T3>See Wisconsin Television, Ltd., </T3>59 RR 2d 193 (1985) (television-newspapercross-interest case). Although recent appropriations legislation circumscribesCommission authority in the area of newspaper cross-ownership, the legislationis inapplicable to the non-attributable relationships discussed herein.<T3>See Making Appropriations for the Departments of Commerce, Justice,and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies for the Fiscal Year EndingSeptember 30, 1989, and for Other Purposes, </T3>Pub. L. No. 100-459 (signedOctober 1, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\<T3>News International, PLC, </T3>97 FCC 2d 349, 367-71 (1984) (cross-interestsbetween cable television systems and television stations in same market).The cable/broadcast cross-ownership rule prohibits, <T3>inter alia, </T3>the common ownership of a cable television systemand a television broadcast station whose predicted Grade B contour coversany portion of the service area of the cable television system. <T3>See </T3>47 CFR 76.501(a)(2) (1986). This provision of the cable/broadcastcross-ownership rule was recently codified in the Cable CommunicationsPolicy Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-549, 98 Stat. 2779, 2785 (codified at47 U.S.C. 553(a) (Supp. II 1984)). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\For example, even though the multiple ownership rulespermit the common ownership of colocated commercial AM and FM stations,the cross-interest policy has been invoked where cross-interests existbetween separately controlled AM and FM stations in the same market. <T3>See, e.g., Lexington County Broadcasters, Inc., </T3>42 FCC 2d 581(Rev. Bd. 1973). 13. At the time the policy developed, and for much of its history, theattribution rules were narrow, leaving many relationships outside theirpurview.\2\\3\<NOTE/> Under the former rules only the duopoly provisions were ineffect. Thus, only the cross-interest policy prevented an owner of onestation from holding a position as an officer, director, manager, or minoritystockholder in a competitor. In 1953, the attribution rules were revised,as they applied to the national ownership limit, to include all minorityinterests, partners, and officers and directors.\2\\4\<NOTE/> Recently, the attribution rules were further modified toexempt from their scope holders of less than five percent of the votingstock of the licensee and limited partners.\2\\5\<NOTE/> In addition, relief from attribution was provided to certainofficers and directors whose duties are unrelated to broadcast operations.Thus, under the revised attribution rules, ownership of as little as fivepercent of the voting stock of a broadcasting station is treated the sameas majority ownership for purposes of applying the local ownership rules.As a result of these intervening revisions, the attribution rules now proscribemany of the interests that originally led to the adoption of the cross-interestpolicy.\2\\6\<NOTE/> For example, interests of officers and directors, and ofminority stockholders that were originally prohibited by the cross-interestpolicy alone now come within the purview of Commission rules. Similarly,where voting ownership interests at or above five percent are involved,the rules, instead of the policy, now apply. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\The attribution provisions are contained in notes appendedto the local ownership rules and, in essence, constitute the means by whichthe local ownership rules are implemented. Currently, they provide that,<T3>inter alia, </T3>partnership and direct ownership interests of votingstock of five percent or more will be cognizable as ownership interestssignificant enough to invoke the rule. They also provide that officersand directors of a licensee are positions which entail an amount of controlgreat enough to require prohibition under the rule. 47 CFR 73.3555, Note2(a) (1986). Exempted from attributable interest are passive investor interestsunder ten percent, holders of nonvoting stock, limited partners and certainofficers and directors who certify that they are not materially involvedin the management or operation of the licensee. 47 CFR 73.3555, Note 2(c),(f), (g)(1), and (h) (1986). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\<T3>Amendment of the Multiple Ownership Rules, </T3>18 FCC 288 (1953).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\<T3>See </T3>47 CFR 73.3555, 76.501, Notes 1, 2 (1986). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\<T3>See Attribution of Ownership Interests, </T3>97 FCC 2d at 999 n.4.Summary of Comments 14. The majority of commenters agree with the initial views expressed inthe <T3>Notice </T3>that the cross-interest policy no longer serves the publicinterest and should be eliminated.\27\<NOTE/> Commenters supporting elimination of the policy, includingNAB, Group W, Morgan Stanley, and Cox, cite the confusion and uncertaintycreated by the cross-interest policy as it relates to the multiple ownershiprules. They express concern with the <T3>ad hoc </T3>application of the policy that fails to provide the kindof clear guidelines which the rules provide in this area. They maintainthat the unpredictable application of the cross-interest policy may requireevaluation whether a relationship permitted by the Commission's rules willbe transformed into one which is prohibited pursuant to the cross-interestpolicy. Such a determination is difficult for a licensee to make in lightof the varying case law, and any conclusion in this area often lacks certainty,thus impeding efficient decision making. Commenters further assert thatthe concerns underlying the policy are now addressed by either market forcesor alternative rules and remedies. They argue that market pressure createsincentives for licensees to meet the needs and desires of the public ratherthan enter into relationships which would have a deleterious effect oncompetition and diversity. Audience reaction aside, commenters maintainthat state and federal antitrust actions, as well as remedies based oncontracts between parties, will discourage abuses and provide relief shouldany such abuse occur. Thus, they conclude that the public interest canbe protected through means less restrictive and more certain than the cross-interestpolicy. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Comments supporting elimination of the cross-interestpolicy were filed by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), WestinghouseBroadcasting, Inc. (Group W), Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Inc. (Morgan Stanley),and Cox Enterprises, Inc. (Cox). London Bridge Broadcasting, Inc. (LondonBridge) filed comments which generally support elimination of the cross-interestpolicy except as it applies to key employee positions. Comments opposingelimination of the policy were filed jointly by the Consumer Federationof America and Telecommunications Research and Action Center (CFA/TRAC).Amherest Broadcasting, Inc. (ABI), in a reply to the comments of NAB, opposedelimination of the policy. To the extent these comments and reply commentsaddress the subject of cross-interests involving key employees nonattributableequity interests or joint ventures, they will be incorporated by referencein the record of the new proceeding instituted today. 15. Specifically, these commenters argue that retention of the policy harmsthe public interest through delay and, in many instances, discouragementof investment in media properties. They assert that the risk of a cross-interestchallenge always exists even if the relationship is structured to comportwith Commission rules. They stress that this uncertainty hampers the abilityof broadcasters to enter into relationships which may improve existingfacilities or provide new facilities. 16. These commenters assert that the policy is no longer necessary to promotecompetition and viewpoint diversity due to the growth of the marketplace.They maintain that the proliferation of media outlets has attenuated theneed for Commission-imposed restraints to ensure against anti-competitiveabuses. They assert further that, in the event such abuses do occur, marketplaceforces should correct the misconduct without Commission intervention. Theyargue that the cross-interest policy is an artificial and unnecessary impedimentto the functioning of the marketplace which, due to competitive pressure,polices itself. They conclude that practices that are anticompetitive andreduce diversity are simply too difficult to coordinate due to the numberof outlets and, therefore, will be ineffective. Further, stations musttry to optimize performance in order to retain a share of the market, andthat effort could be thwarted by an adverse reaction, from their audienceor competitors, to any anticompetitive practices. 17. All commenters who support elimination of the cross-interest policyalso argue that the local ownership rules, particularly the attributionprovisions, include the majority of relationships sought to be addressedby the cross-interest policy. They point out that the local ownership rulesand the attribution provisions are the product of extensive rulemakingproceedings designed to determine which interests create a level of concernsufficient to require proscription. They maintain that relationships fallingoutside of the rules are of minimal significance and have, therefore, beendeemed nonattributable. They further assert that the cross-interest policyundercuts the purpose of these rulemakings by creating uncertainty wherethe rules strive for clarity. Commenters, therefore, conclude that thelocal ownership rules and the attribution provisions should stand as theCommission's determination of what relationships are inconsistent withthe public interest. To the extent that the multiple ownership rules donot address all relationships contemplated by the policy, commenters reiteratetheir contention that alternative policing mechanisms exist in the marketplacewhich would discourage anticompetitive misconduct before it occurs, orprovide a remedy in the event such abuse arises. 18. In opposing elimination of the cross-interest policy, CFA/TRAC arguethat while streamlining the policy is desirable, elimination is unwarranted.They point to what they characterize as an overwhelming desire of the Commissionto eliminate all multiple ownership rules as demonstrated by a recent rulemaking proceeding inquiring into the duopoly and one-to-a-market rules.\28\<NOTE/> These commenters specifically take issue with the Commission'sassertion, in the <T3>Notice</T3>, that revisions of the attribution rules have abrogatedthe need for the cross-interest policy in many instances. They argue that,in light of the duopoly rulemaking proceeding, it is disingenuous for theCommission to rely on the local ownership rules and the attribution provisionsas support for eliminating the cross-interest policy. CFA/TRAC points outthat the Commission has previously predicated repeal of one policy on theexistence of another even as the latter faces repeal, and is followinga similar course in the instant proceeding. They assert that repeal ofthe one-to-a-market rule \29\<NOTE/> has already been accomplished through a liberal policy ofgranting stays of outstanding divestiture obligations. Thus, in conjunctionwith the Commission's lack of commitment to the ownership rules, repealof the cross-interest policy will leave unchecked relationships which willlead to an increase in predatory practices resulting in a diminution ofcompetition and a reduction in program options. They conclude that retentionof the policy in a clarified form is, therefore, required to promote thepublic interest. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>Amendment of andSection; 73.3555 of the Commission's Rules, the BroadcastMultiple Ownership Rules, </T3>2 FCC Rcd 1138 (1987) (<T3>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</T3> in MM Docket No. 87-7). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ 47 CFR 73.3555(b) (1986). 19. Similarly, in reply comments, ABI maintains that the NAB relies tooheavily on the attribution provisions as support for elimination of thecross-interest policy. ABI argues that the policy is designed to supplementthe attribution provisions and provide the Commission with the means bywhich to promote, independent of other government agencies, arms-lengthcompetition. It further asserts that the NAB points to no instance in whichthe antitrust laws have addressed competitive abuses of the type encompassedby the cross-interest policy, thus failing to demonstrate that relianceon antitrust laws to cope with cross-interest concerns is either an effectivedeterrent or remedy. Arguing that the cross-interest policy is necessaryto promote arms-length competition, ABI concludes that the Commission'srules, without more, are inadequate to protect against certain anticompetitivepractices. ABI contends that where specific rules are applicable the cross-interestpolicy should not apply, but where there are gaps in the rules the cross-interestpolicy is required to stem abuses. ABI concludes that the policy should,therefore, be clarified and retained for use only on an ``as needed'' basis.Discussion20. Although, as indicated, there are aspects of this policy with respectto which further comment is being sought, the analysis that follows providesnot only the justification for the changes we are adopting but establishesa background against which the remainder of the policy should eventuallybe judged. After a careful review of the record in this proceeding, wefind that the public interest would be better served by reducing the scopeof the cross-interest policy.\3\\0\<NOTE/> While this policy may have been at one time regarded as necessaryto preserve competition and diversity of viewpoint, a number of differentfactors, including changes in the mass media marketplace, modificationsof the attribution rules, and the adequacy of other legal remedies, convinceus that a substantial part of this policy is not essential to maximizediversification of viewpoints to the public or to prevent undue concentrationof economic power. Similarly, we are further convinced that, with respectto the interests addressed herein, the costs associated with continuedcase-by-case review outweigh the minimal public interest benefits thatmight be derived therefrom. As we explain below, we are confident thatthe public's access to a multiplicity of programs, information, and viewpointswill not be adversely affected as a result of our removal of these unnecessarilyrestrictive aspects of the policy. We are also equally confident that economiccompetition in mass media markets will not materially diminish, but, onthe contrary, will continue to flourish to the overall benefit of the public.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ As stated earlier, exempted from this policy statementshall be cross-interests involving certain joint ventures not otherwiseaddressed by the attribution rules, key employees, and certain nonattributableequity interests. Subject to the outcome of our <T3>Further Notice of Inquiry/Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,</T3> thesecross-interests will continue to be subject to review.<ITAG tagnum="81">Growth of Media Outlets</ITAG>21. Since the implementation of the cross-interest policy, there has beenrapid and widespread growth in mass media outlets. This growth has ledto a significant increase in diversity nationwide and, of even more relevanceto the instant proceeding, locally. While we do not rely upon these changesalone to reach the determinations herein, we do believe that, togetherwith the other factors presented below, they undercut the notion that anysingle entity or individual is capable of manipulating or otherwise skewingcompetition in the marketplace of ideas or in the economic marketplaceto the detriment of the public through the cross-interests mentioned above.22. <T3>National Growth.</T3> To the extent that the logic behind the cross-interestpolicy was appropriate when first developed, the substantial growth inbroadcast services across all markets, and the resulting increase in competitionand diversity have reduced our concerns about the relationships addressedby the policy. For example, between 1950 and 1988, the total number ofAM, FM, and TV broadcast stations authorized increased from 3,144 to 12,207outlets, an increase of 288.3%.\3\\1\<NOTE/> Moreover, continued growth in the broadcast services canbe expected as a result of recent Commission actions designed to fostergrowth of the industry.\3\\2\<NOTE/> In addition, there has been substantial expansion of alternatemedia services such as cable television, low power television (LPTV), andvideo cassette recorders (VCRs).\3\\3\<NOTE/> The potential for even further growth of media outlets existsfrom other developing technologies, including multipoint distribution systems(MDS) and satellite master antenna television systems (SMATVs).\3\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\ In 1950 there were 2,302 AM, 732 FM, and 109 televisionstations. <T3>Sixteenth Annual Report of the Federal Communications Commission_FY1950, </T3>at 102.

Paul Kagan Associates, Inc., <T3>Multicast Newsletter, </T3>No. 322, November 10, 1986.23. <T3>Local Growth. </T3>This growth of media outlets on a national levelis paralleled by the growth of such outlets on the local level. In analyzingthe need for the cross-interest policies, the number of outlets at thelocal level is more relevant than national growth because the policy wasdeveloped as a supplement to the local ownership rules. With this in mind,we note that a study submitted by the NAB \35\<NOTE/> assessed the number of media outlets, including publications,within all television markets (Designated Market Areas). The study showsthat there are a large number of media outlets and information sourcesin local markets of all sizes. For example, whereas the top 25 marketsaverage about 72 radio and television stations per market, even the smallesttelevision markets average about 9 radio and television outlets per market.\36\<NOTE/> In addition, our own analysis of Arbitron data by MetropolitanStatistical Area, the geographic market measure that may be more appropriatefor radio reception, shows that while the top 25 radio markets averageapproximately 35 total AM and FM stations, even the smallest radio marketsaverage approximately 10 commercial AM and FM stations. As these figuresdemonstrate, there are a significant number of commercial broadcast outletsthroughout markets of all sizes. Further, if cable and VCRs are taken intoaccount, listeners and viewers have even more sources of programs. Cablepenetration actually increases as the size of television markets decreases,\37\<NOTE/> and VCR penetration appears to be relatively constant acrossmarket sizes.\38\<NOTE/> This multitude of media sources provides audiences with awide diversity of choices, and also encourages broadcasters to provideservice in the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ NAB Media Outlet Study, <T3>supra</T3> note 33.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ <T3>Id. </T3>at Figure 1.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ <T3>Id. </T3>at Figure III.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ <T3>Id. </T3>at Figure 6.24. We believe the competitive and diverse market which has developed sincethe initial implementation of the cross-interest policy substantially attenuatesthe need for our regulatory oversight of the interests at issue here topromote diversity and economic competition. As suggested by Cox, marketconditions have reduced diversity concerns because stations are under strongmarket pressure to maximize performance and typically do so through providingservice desired by the public.\39\<NOTE/> With many competing media outlets available to the public,consumers can easily switch from one station to another if the first station'sprograms do not suit their tastes. Hence, stations have strong incentivesto take into account the tastes and needs of viewers or listeners. Moreover,we recognized, in a previous proceeding eliminating regulations which encroachedon licensee's business practices, that the increased number of stationsand the increase in facilities give new importance to the uniqueness ofa program format in an effort to attract advertising dollars.\40\<NOTE/> This plethora of media services, and the resulting increasein the diversity of voices, therefore, strongly undercuts, in our view,any underlying need for restraints on consulting agreements, advertisingagencies, and time brokerage arrangements to enhance diversity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ Comments of Cox Enterprises at 10.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ <T3>Second Report and Order in Re Elimination of Unnecessary BroadcastRegulation, </T3>59 RR 2d 1500, 1517 (1986) (MM Docket No. 83-842).25. Moreover, the considerable choice which exists in the marketplace createsincentives for service providers to compete as vigorously as possible.Because of the many competing stations, they are more likely to be acutelyaware of their audience's desires, and to attempt to meet those desiresin order to compete successfully. For example, it is doubtful that consultingagreements would continue to be a legitimate concern, since the stationentering into such an agreement must continue to remain responsive to theneeds and interests of its audience or risk losing a portion of that audience.Thus, a station would likely disregard advice from a consultant which wouldonly serve to protect the consultant's cross-interest and would not improvethe outlet's competitive stance. If a station is unresponsive to its audience,its ratings will drop, and the resultant decrease in earnings will influencethe station as much as, if not more than, Commission policy. Accordingly,we believe that the remarkable growth in the broadcast market, and themass media marketplace generally, are important factors which suggest thatcontinued review of interests such as these is not needed to achieve itsoriginal and primary goal of preserving diversity and competition amongmedia voices in a given market.<ITAG tagnum="81">Costs/Burdens Imposed By Operation Of The Cross-Interest Policy</ITAG>26. We have also evaluated the costs and burdens imposed on the publicby continuing to scrutinize consulting arrangements, advertising agencyarrangements, and time brokerage agreements. We conclude that these aspectsof the cross-interest policy impose costs and burdens on the public, aswell as the Commission, which are difficult to justify given the reducedneed for continued oversight of these relationships. As discussed below,these costs vary in character, but are alike in that they are not counterbalancedby any significant concomitant public interest benefits.27. <T3>The Policy Creates Uncertainty in Broadcasters and Other Media Entrepreneurs.</T3>First, the <T3>ad hoc </T3>development of the policy has had the unintended effectof surrounding certain media transactions with a cloud of uncertainty.In the line of cases from which the policy has evolved the Commission hastried to determine whether particular relationships are ``meaningful''and whether the media outlets at issue serve ``substantially'' the samearea. Inconsistencies among these cases render difficult, if not impossible,a definitive determination by broadcasters, in advance of adjudication,as to whether an overlap in service areas is substantial enough or a relationshipsufficiently meaningful to warrant regulatory intervention. For example,it is unclear, from an examination of the case law, how the cross-interestpolicy would be applied to time brokerage arrangements. In one case, theCommission permitted this type of relationship relying, in part, on thelarge number of radio stations in the market.\41\<NOTE/> The Commission indicated that the small percentage of localstations programmed by the same licensee reduced concern that the timebrokerage relationship would have a negative effect on the pubic interest.In another decision, the Commission found no violation of the cross-interestpolicy even though the time brokerage agreement resulted in one licenseeprogramming the only two nighttime radio stations operating in the areaduring the brokered time period.\42\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ <T3>Dual-Language TV/FM Programming in Puerto Rico, </T3>33 RR 2d 515 (1975).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ <T3>Station WWSM, </T3>31 FCC 2d 584 (1971).28. As commenters assert, the inconsistency in the case law complicatesthe business planning of inherently complex media transactions. In spiteof bona fide efforts to avoid any actual control in another media entitythrough the use of relationships which are clearly permitted by our cross-ownershiprules, broadcasters may unintentionally run afoul of our policy.\43\<NOTE/> Further, the fact that the cross-interest policy addressespotential rather than actual harm, together with the absence of a requirementthat specific allegations of fact be demonstrated,\44\<NOTE/> leave broadcasters particularly vulnerable to cross-interestchallenges by competitors, even if groundless. It is, therefore, possiblethat parties might decide not to enter into a particular relationship merelybecause of the absence of clear-cut guidelines about whether the relationshipwould pass muster under the cross-interest policy.\45\<NOTE/> In fact, Morgan Stanley asserts that there are numerous situationsin which unobjectionable relationships will not be undertaken due to uncertaintyregarding potential effects of the policy. In short, the policy placesburdens on outside sources and on the Commission's resources which mustbe borne by the public. Even if it is quite likely that the relationshipwould be approved, the affected parties have no way of reliably predictingthat result in advance.\46\<NOTE/> Past cases construing the policy afford some general guidance,but do not approach the specificity required for parties to determine,in advance, the propriety of the anticipated relationship. Thus, relationshipswhich might benefit licensees and the public often may be avoided or abortedbecause of the policy's lack of clarity.\47\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ <T3>See </T3>Comments of Morgan Stanley at 5-11. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ <T3>Cleveland Television Corp., </T3>732 F.2d at 970. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ <T3>See </T3>Comments of Morgan Stanley at 11-12. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ For example, although the Commission intended to applythe cross-interest policy to ownership interests in newspapers, <T3>see Multiple Ownership, </T3>50 FCC 2d 1046, 1076-77 (1975), the Commissiondeclined to do so when it approved a transfer which resulted in a nonattributablestock interest in the licensee of a television station being held by theowner of a daily newspaper which served the same market. <T3>Evening Star Broadcasting Co., </T3>68 FCC 2d 129 (1978). Althoughthe Commission discussed the impact on competition in that case, the cross-interestpolicy was not invoked to ban the transaction. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ We recognize that vagueness is not fatal to the cross-interestpolicy. However, even if the policy were clarified in an effort to curethis uncertainty, our decision to delete the policy, for the reasons statedherein, would not be altered. 29. <T3>Limitations on Use of Qualified Personnel. </T3>A second burden imposedby the cross-interest policy is that it hinders the ability of media outletsto attract and utilize, in consulting positions, qualified personnel withsubstantial broadcast experience. Barring contract provisions to the contrary,the absence of the cross-interest policy would permit experts to work at,or have interests in, multiple outlets. This would allow a station to attractand utilize personnel who are cognizant of the requirements of stationmanagement and the programming needs and unique characteristics of theparticular market. In turn, this may enable a station to increase revenuesor decrease costs. The increased profits obtained from such efficienciescould then be recycled into improved programming or facilities, providingmore resources to stations suffering from declining revenues and ratings.As a result, a previously unpopular format or station, rather than succumbingto competition, may experience new life and viability in the market throughthe expertise of a consultant. Thus, the use of qualified personnel, nowpotentially barred by our cross-interest policy, may ``rescue'' the station,avoiding a diminution in local diversity and competition. 30. Some would argue that allowing the same person to be employed by twooutlets will only contribute to a diminution of diversity and competition.To the contrary, permitting common ownership of media outlets, in certaincircumstances, does not detract from diversity of viewpoint but may, infact, enhance diversity and competition, providing benefits which inureto the public interest.\48\<NOTE/> Given the trend towards counterprogramming and narrowcasting,it is reasonable to assume that this same result may occur by permittingbroadcast stations to attract and utilize all qualified personnel. Consultantsand similar professionals have a clear business incentive to provide adviceand assistance that address the individual needs of their clients. Viewedin that light, a consultant will counsel each client station accordingto its particular situation. For this reason, a consultant serving differentbroadcasters in the same market might well give each client different adviceregarding the type of programming that will effectively maximize its audience.The consultant might recommend, for example, a ``top-forty'' format toone radio station while advising another competing outlet to use an allnews format, thereby stimulating diversity in the market. Furthermore,as a general proposition, freed of the cross-interest policy, broadcasterswill have more flexibility to enter into relationships which may strengthentheir viability and thus preserve existing levels of diversity of viewpointand competition. We, therefore, believe it is in the public interest topermit the use of qualified personnel between competing media outlets.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ <T3>Amendment of andSection; 73.3555 of the Commission's Rules, the BroadcastMultiple Ownership Rules, ___ FCC Record ___ (1988) (</T3><T3>Second Report and Order </T3>in MM Docket No. 87-7, adopted December12, 1988) andpara;andpara; 51-64. <T3>See also </T3>P.

Economics 194; FCC NetworkInquiry Special Staff, <T3>New Television Networks: Entry, Jurisdiction, Ownership, and Regulation,</T3>Volume I, at 365-66.31. <T3>Imposition of Administrative Costs.</T3> A third burden imposed bythe continued application of the cross-interest policy results in administrativecosts placed upon affected parties as well as the Commission. Such costscould be justified, but only if the review process involved was likelyto lead to discovery of significant public interest concerns not otherwiseremediable. Where a potential cross-interest issue is raised, the Commissionmust review the facts and allegations and determine if a <T3>prima facie</T3> case has been presented under the policy. Where thefacts of a case are such that a cross-interest issue is designated forhearing, this process can be even longer and more complex. Often, an individualmust go through administrative review in order to show that his proposedrelationship does not violate the cross-interest policy.\49\<NOTE/> This process is often time consuming and costly to the participantsand the Commission. As we recognized in a prior proceeding, even one investigationculminating in a hearing significantly increases the resources requiredto administer our policies.\50\<NOTE/> Further, in addition to the costs of investigation and enforcement,countless staff hours may be spent responding to inquiries relating tothe applicability and interpretation of the policy.\51\<NOTE/> In view of the lack of benefits involved in continued retentionof the policy to address consultancies, advertising agency relationshipsand time brokerage agreements, the costs of applying the policy to theserelationships are unjustifiably high. Given the questionable value of continuedoversight of these relationships in the current competitive market, thesecost may be reduced, and the public better served, by reliance on methodsother than the policy to protect the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\<T3>See, e.g., Metromedia Broadcasting Corporation,</T3> 1 FCC Rcd 1022(1986); <T3>Wisconsin Television, Ltd.,</T3> 102 FCC 2d at 1001.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\<T3>Elimination of Unnecessary Broadcast Regulation,</T3> 59 RR 2d at 1509.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ABI argues that these administrative burdens can be minimizedby applying the policy only on an ``as needed'' basis where it is necessaryto ensure free competition. This approach, however, would in no way precludethe need for case-by-case adjudication and might further complicate theprocess by requiring the Commission to make findings or establish guidelinesas to when the policy should be invoked.<ITAG tagnum="81">Adequacy of Existing Regulatory Prohibitions</ITAG>32. We also believe that the need for the existing cross-interest policyhas decreased with the adoption of new attribution provisions in the ownershiprules that have superceded the cross-interest policy in several respects.Originally, the cross-interest policy was developed to fill the intersticesleft by the early ownership rules. Since then, we have amended the ownershiprules\52\<NOTE/> and adopted new attribution provisions\53\<NOTE/> to encompass a greater number of relationships that previouslywere addressed only by the cross-interest policy. At the time the Commissionadopted the new attribution rules, we stated that the duopoly and one-to-a-marketrules would be applied, in lieu of the policy, ``where voting ownershipinterests at or above the relevant benchmarks [five percent stock ownershipor officers or directors] are involved.''\54\<NOTE/> Thus, for example, cross directorships and substantial minorityinterests, which, until amendment of the ownership rules only fell withinthe purview of the policy, are now expressly covered by these rules.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\<T3>Amendment of the Multiple Ownership Rules,</T3> 18 FCC 288 (1953).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\<T3>See Attribution of Ownership Interests,</T3> 97 FCC 2d at 1032-33.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\<T3>Id.</T3> at 999 n.4 (parenthetical statement added).33. In developing the local ownership rules, in the 1940s, and modifyingthe scope of our attribution provisions in the 1980s, the Commission identifiedthose relationships which were of genuine concern because of their potentialfor abuse. We concluded that ownership of five percent or more of a station'sstock or a position as an officer or director of a licensee were situationswhich would be deemed attributable for purposes of the multiple ownershiprule.\55\<NOTE/> Conversely, nonvoting stockholders and limited partners,we decided, do not take part in control and, therefore, would not be consideredattributable for the purposes of the ownership rules.\56\<NOTE/> These actions reflected our informed policy judgment on thetypes of relationships which would detrimentally affect diversity and competitionand should, therefore, be restricted in order to promote the public interest.\57\<NOTE/> As for CFA/TRAC's argument that our reliance on the multipleownership rules is misplaced because we are proposing to repeal those rules,\58\<NOTE/> we think it is sufficient to note that our recent decisionsonly modestly revised the duopoly and one-to-a-market rules.\59\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\<T3>Id.</T3> at 1025.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\<T3>Id.</T3> at 1020, 1022.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\At the time of modifying the attribution provisions, westated that ``[t]he attribution rules . . . are designed to measure whatownership interests will confer that amount of influence or control whichmust be limited.'' The scope of that proceeding, however, did not encompassthe cross-interest policy, which addresses business relationships of broadcastersthat do not rise to the level of attributable interests. Therefore, wedid not revisit in that rulemaking whether the relationships covered bythe cross-interest policy continued to confer sufficient influence or controlto warrant limitations comparable to those governing attributable interests.Although we stated that the attribution rulemaking proceeding was not intendedto affect the cross-interest policy and that the policy would continueto be applied except where, as a practical matter, it overlapped with specificprovisions of the new attribution rules, <T3>see id.</T3> at 1000 n.4, it was not our intent to foreclose reexaminationof the continued validity and effectiveness of the cross-interest policy.We note that any relationship covered by the cross-interest policy thatis deemed to pose a serious threat to viewpoint diversity or competition,should be treated, if possible, as an attributable interest under the localownership rules rather than subjecting it to <T3>ad hoc</T3> review as is our current practice. As noted previously,we are inviting further comment with respect to the appropriate regulatorytreatment of key employees and certain joint ventures and nonattributableequity interests in a separate proceeding. With respect to nonattributableequity interests and joint ventures, however, if we decide in our separateproceeding that they require continued oversight, it may not be possibleto incorporate them in the ownership rules. The multiplicity of possiblerelationships makes it difficult to forecast definitively all the relationshipswhich threaten diversity or competition. Thus, should we decide at theconclusion of our separate proceeding that these interests continue towarrant Commission scrutiny, our current <T3>ad hoc</T3> review may be necessary for such interests. We would nonethelesslike to develop, if possible, any guidelines that might identify, at leastin general terms, those nonattributable equity and other interests thatrequire continued oversight to minimize uncertainty caused by continuedcase-by-case review.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\<T3>See Amendment of andSection;73.3555 of the Commission's Rules, the BroadcastMultiple Ownership Rules,</T3> 2 FCC Rcd 1138 (1988) (<T3>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</T3> in MM Docket No. 87-7).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\<T3>See Amendment of andSection;73.3555 of the Commission's Rules, the BroadcastMultiple Ownership Rules,</T3> ___ FCC Rcd ___ (1988) (<T3>First Report and Order</T3> in MM Docket No. 87-7, adopted October27, 1988) (Radio Duopoly Rule); <T3>Amendment of andSection;73.3555 of the Commission's Rules, the BroadcastMultiple Ownership Rules,</T3> ___ FCC Rcd ___ (1988) (<T3>Second Report and Order</T3> in MM Docket No. 87-7, adopted December12, 1988) (One-to-a-Market-Rule). These decisions were adopted concurrentwith, or shortly after, the Commission adopted the instant <T3>Policy Statement,</T3> but prior to its release.34. Further reducing our concern with respect to the need for the existingcross-interest policy are remedies in the form of federal and state antitrustlaws, which may be available to reduce or deter potential anticompetitiveconsequences which the cross-interest policy is designed to curb. Antitrustanalysis will take into account the market sizes and the number of competitorswhen determining if a violation has occurred. The potential for anti-competitiveconsequences perceived to be present in such relationship as consultingagreements, time brokerage arrangements, and relationships involving advertisingagencies is reduced by the presence of these laws. The existence of suchlaws and remedies has supported modification or elimination of other rulesand policies.\60\<NOTE/> To the extent that they reduce anticompetitive effects, theseremedies may also have an ancillary effect which, in conjunction with thesubstantial market growth, discussed <T3>supra</T3> paras. 21-25, reduces our concern over diversity. We believethat reliance on such alternative forms of deterrence will more effectivelyserve the public interest and preclude the need for a stringent policyto insure against anticompetitive consequences.\61\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\<T3>See, e.g., Elimination of Unnecessary Broadcast Regulation,</T3> 59RR 2d at 1500; <T3>Golden West Policy,</T3> 87 FCC 2d at 668.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\The fact that broadcasters are subject to Federal licensingand regulation, of course, does not immunize them from antitrust oversight.In this regard, we note that, in addition to possible governmental enforcementactions in this area, the private parties injured by Federal antitrustlaw violations are entitled to bring a private action for treble damagesagainst the defendant. Clayton Act, ch 323, Section 4, 38 Stat. 731 (1914)(15 U.S.C. 15 (1982)).35. Also, contractual arrangements into which the parties enter may providefurther protection from anticompetitive activity. For example, the improperuse of consultants or advertising agencies could conceivably give riseto a cause of action for breach of contract. Alternatively, such actionsmight give rise to a breach of a fiduciary duty imposed by either the contractingparty or by the entity with which the cross-interest relationship exists.Further, a station that wishes to hire a consultant may insert into theterms of the contract a provision to require that any confidential businessinformation obtained during the consultancy period not be disclosed toa rival station for which the consultant also worked.\62\<NOTE/> Similarly, contracts can protect stations in situations inwhich an advertising agency with a cross-interest in one station in a marketcontracts to purchase time on competing stations. As part of the contractualrelationship, a client may require the agency to spread advertising amongcompeting stations in order to reach a larger audience or a broader demographicbase. Thus, if the agency favors the station with which it shares a commoninterest by directing advertisers exclusively to that station, an actionfor breach of contract may lie. Notwithstanding the legal remedies available,the harm to the reputation of one who breaches these types of contractualrequirements acts as a strong incentive to conduct themselves in a forthrightmanner. The existence of these alternative prohibitions further reducesour concern that permitting cross-interest relationships will result inharm to the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ In fact, it is within the discretion of the licensee,prior to retaining a consultant, to require disclosure of the consultant'sother media interests, permitting the licensee to make an informed judgmentregarding possible conflicts of interest.<ITAG tagnum="81">Summary</ITAG>36. <T3>Consulting Positions and Advertising Agencies. </T3>The vast changesin the media marketplace reduce our concern that these interests will resultin harm to the public interest. Current market conditions require consultantsand advertising agencies to represent clients vigorously in order to remaincompetitive. Thus, it would not avail representatives to favor one clientover any other. Our concern with the possible anticompetitive effects ofthese interests is further attenuated by the availability of alternativemethods to prevent and remedy abuses. Specifically, contract provisionscan create enhanced duties of care, confidentiality requirements, or affirmativeobligations in the method of conducting business. These agreements canprotect the rights of the parties as well as deter anticompetitive conduct.In the event of abuse, less speculative remedies are available in the formof federal and state antitrust laws or, if the relationship is contractual,an action for breach. These alternatives serve both deterrent and remedialpurposes and will address actual abuses, should they occur, rather thancircumscribe potentially beneficial relationships in an effort to preventspeculative abuses.37. <T3>Time Brokerage Arrangements. </T3>The substantial increase in mediaoutlets, and the corresponding increase in diversity and competition, sincethe implementation of the cross-interest policy, reduces the need to prohibittime brokerage arrangements to protect the public interest. Competitiveconditions require a station that decides to broker its time to anotherto remain alert to the needs of its audience or risk losing some of thataudience to a competitor, with a resultant decrease in ratings and revenue.Thus, the amount of choice available to listeners and viewers insures thatcompetition will be vigorous in order for a station to retain its shareof the audience. Should an anticompetitive arrangement occur, the antitrustlaws are equally applicable to remedy this situation as they are to remedyabuse of relationships involving consulting positions and advertising agencies.Moreover, since a licensee entering into a time brokerage arrangement mustcontinue to maintain control over its programming, the fact that some ofits programming may be provided by another station in the market does notraise the same viewpoint diversity questions that may be raised if stationsin the market were under common ownership or shared key employees.38. Our decision to narrow the scope of the cross-interest policy is furtherbased on the fact that revisions to the attribution rules now directlyaddress a number of interests previously limited only by the policy. Moreover,our action here will reduce the number of <T3>ad hoc </T3>determinations required, thus making it easier for broadcastersand others to determine when a relationship will be circumscribed. Thiswill, in turn, reduce the chilling effect on potentially beneficial relationshipsbecause of the lack of specificity on which to base a determination whetherthe relationship will ultimately be permitted.39. In our view, wherever feasible it is more efficient and effective toconfront whatever cross-interest problems arise by applying the variousremedies (<T3>e.g.</T3>, breach of contract and federal and state antitrust provisions)which are designed to discourage activities that may be inimical to thewelfare of the public. Our present policy ignores the fact that every cross-interestcovered by the policy is not certain to harm the public; in fact, we concludethat some might be beneficial. We will thus allow parties affected by particularcross-interests and, as to antitrust issues, the Justice Department andthe Federal Trade Commission, to identify and take appropriate action asthose cross-interests emerge.40. The decision contained herein has been analyzed with respect to thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980, and found to impose a new or modifiedinformation collection requirement on the public. Implementation of anynew or modified requirement will be subject to approval of the Office ofManagement and Budget as prescribed by the Act.41. Accordingly, <T3>it is ordered, </T3>That the cross-interest policy, except as appliedto joint ventures, key employee relationships, and nonattributable equityinterests as discussed herein, <T3>is eliminated </T3>effective <T3>April 6, 1989.</T3>42. Authority for the policy decisions herein is contained in sections4(i) and 303 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.43.
