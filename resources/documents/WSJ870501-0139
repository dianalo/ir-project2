He will make a strong defense of Contra aid in a speech Sunday on the eve of Congress's Iran-Contra hearings. White House aides also plan to keep him moving and hitting on social and economic issues; he'll talk about trade in Pennsylvania, education in Tennessee. The president may also meet with reporters a bit more frequently, perhaps holding a formal press conference every six to eight weeks.    Aides insist there's no grand P.R. plan in case of bombshell Iran-Contra revelations. &quot;The hearings are a fact of life. There's nothing we can do about them,&quot; says one senior official. Officials hope the public will soon lose interest in them and move on to other topics. A Gorbachev summit would surely help divert attention, but officials can't count on that.    Some White House aides think that Bush has more to fear from damaging disclosures than does the President himself.    DEFICIT DEBATES complicate efforts to pass a debt-ceiling measure.    Democrats want to use the bill to force Reagan to cut a budget deal, but he remains aloof. Instead, the administration works with GOP Sen. Gramm in an effort to fix constitutional flaws in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law. But even some Reagan aides privately question that strategy, arguing that his defense plans would be the big loser under a repaired Gramm-Rudman.    What's more, House Democrats won't allow any measure that lets Reagan off the hook. &quot;The whole goal is to bring the president into the loop so it's impossible for him to abdicate his responsibility,&quot; a Budget Committee member says. Congress may yet pass a short-term debt bill while it searches for a way out of the impasse.    HIGHER INTEREST RATES stir unease in the administration and Congress.    While Treasury officials aren't unhappy with the Fed's modest tightening, they say it is &quot;about as much as we need&quot; to help stabilize the dollar and don't want much more. White House aides Sprinkel and Miller continue to worry that the Fed is becoming too tight, though Howard Baker pays little heed.    Republican senators last week expressed concern in a meeting with Volcker. Meanwhile, Senate Banking Committee Democrats consider requiring the administration and the Fed to disclose their international economic discussions, a move aimed at increasing pressure for the U.S. and its allies to better coordinate policies.    Nakasone's promise yesterday to cut Japanese interest rates may help ease fears of further Fed tightening.    ESCALATION: The administration is about to step up its war on drugs in Latin America. Plans are under way to provide U.S. military assistance for eradication efforts similar to the one begun last year in Bolivia -- this time in Peru and Belize. But critics say the U.S. shies from tough action against more important targets, like Mexico and the Bahamas.    SCALIA'S SCORECARD: Despite a spate of news stories early in the Supreme Court term that Scalia's voting was more liberal than expected, later returns place him firmly on the right. With half the term's opinions out, he has voted with Chief Justice Rehnquist 80% of the time and with liberal Justice Brennan just 44% of the time.    AH, SO: Former Chief of Staff Regan will be paid $20,000 to speak at a New York luncheon Monday launching Business Tokyo, an English-language magazine published by Japan's Keizaiki magazine. Also in the works is what one associate calls a &quot;much more lucrative&quot; appearance in Japan in late July.    COMEBACK TRAIL? Former California Gov. Jerry Brown, last seen in Japan writing a book about his career, is back and practicing law in Los Angeles. He is working on issues with California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown -- no relation -- who detects &quot;a desire to get back into politics&quot; in the ex-governor. &quot;I'm telling you, there is nothing foggy about him,&quot; the speaker says.    POLITICAL FACTORS increasingly dominate the arms-control equation.    &quot;This is becoming less a question of weapons and more a question of Allied unity,&quot; says one senior official. West Germany, reluctant to get rid of all short-range nuclear missiles, is expected to deliver its position late next week; its qualms may result in only a partial acceptance of the latest Soviet proposal. The State Department and White House hope to have an Allied position by mid-month.    Pentagon planners push for more conventional weapons to offset any possible nuclear cuts; they argue such steps will reassure the Allies. Proposals include a costly air-defense system to protect vital NATO sites from conventional Soviet weapons; &quot;Silver Streak,&quot; an air-launched missile that could be fired at a safe distance from hostile defenses; and better tank armor and antitank weapons.    House Armed Services Chairman Aspin complains that &quot;Every time you do something like this {discuss nuclear reductions}, the military comes in with a list.&quot;    MINOR MEMOS: Oliver North's recent mail includes a solicitation to buy the &quot;Destroy-it&quot; paper shredder. . . . Part of the problem? The U.S. dollar is printed on Swiss-made presses. . . . Until this week's trade vote, some suggest, Gephardt was so little known that most voters thought Gary Hart had changed his name again. </TEXT></DOC>
