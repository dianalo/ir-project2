McFarlane epitomizedthe success that can come from a combination of luck, hard work,smarts and having the right mentors.   As the son of a Texas congressman, a U.S. Naval Academygraduate, career Marine officer and protege of former secretariesof state Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig, McFarlane had reachedthe pinnacle of power.   He mediated fights between the state and defense departments athome and between Israel and its neighbors abroad, helped salvagethe MX nuclear missile and put out fires for the administration onCapitol Hill.   ``More than anyone else in this administration, Bud McFarlane isthe guy who has the confidence of members of Congress,'' Rep. LesAspin, D-Wis., and chairman of the House Armed Service Committee,said at the time.   He had gotten the job despite opposition from conservativeideologues who wanted it to go to former U.N. Ambassador JeaneKirkpatrick. And no sooner did McFarlane get the job than it beganto unravel.   Within a week, 241 U.S. Marines were killed in Beirut, andMcFarlane lost his first major dispute as national security chief.Reagan sided with Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger to pullout the Marines rather than retaliate militarily as McFarlane andSecretary of State George P. Shultz urged.   It only got worse. Disputes between McFarlane and new WhiteHouse chief of staff Donald T. Regan erupted, eventually leading toMcFarlane's resignation in December 1985.   While citing personal reasons and the desire to spend more timewith his family as his reasons for resigning, McFarlane later toldinterviewers that White House infighting made the job ``no longerfun and professional'' and he complained that Reagan ``did not havea great interest in foreign affairs.''   Then there was Iran-Contra _ a scheme through which theadministration sold arms to Iran and used the proceeds to financeNicaraguan rebels in violation of a congressional prohibition onaiding them militarily.   Although no one knew at the time, McFarlane was a central playerin those events both before and after he left the White House.   On Friday, McFarlane, 51, agreed to plead guilty to fourmisdemeanor charges of withholding information from Congress on theadministration's secret help to the Nicaraguan Contras.   His plea was an appropriate epilogue to two years of drama thatincluded a secret flight to Tehran in May 1986 with plane load ofmissile parts to be swapped for U.S. hostages, a suicide attemptand sorrowful confessions that he bore the brunt of the blame forthe Iran-Contra affair.   ``What really drove me to despair was a sense of having failedthe country,'' McFarlane told The New York Times upon his releasefrom the hospital after taking a overdose of the tranquilizerValium in February 1987.   ``If I had stayed at the White House, I'm sure I could havestopped things from getting worse,'' he said.   Two months later in televised hearings, McFarlane told inquiringcongressmen and the nation how ``I regret and continue to regretthe mistakes I have made.''   Because of his suicide attempt just two months earlier,congressmen did not bore in on McFarlane as much as they did someother witnesses. Maintaining a stoic presence, McFarlane complainedof being treated like ``a fragile flower'' and told hisquestioners: ``Shoot your best shot.''   While his testimony was viewed as being fuzzy on the details, hebecame a model for the psychotherapy community.   Psychologist Joyce Brothers praised him as a man ``who, thoughthere was nothing left for him ... is very heroic on the stand.''   ``He's shown a great deal of ego strength ... after beingthrough the worst that life has to offer, near death,'' Ms.Brothers said. ``People can see someone else who has been throughthe valley and come out safely on the other side.''   McFarlane also has been a model, as an achiever, in his earliersecondary posts. After graduating from the Naval Academy in 1959,he began a 20-year Marine Corps career that included stints atstrategy schools and war colleges here and abroad between tours ofcombat duty in Vietnam.   While still a Marine, he was brought into the White House as amilitary and legislative aide to President Nixon, switching to thennational security adviser Henry Kissinger's staff and remainingthere when Brent Scowcroft succeeded Kissinger under President Ford.   After President Carter's election, the Marine Corps sentMcFarlane to Okinawa. Unhappy with the assignment, he resigned in1979 with the rank of lieutenant colonel and took a staff job withthe Senate Armed Services Committee, working primarily for Sen.John Tower of Texas, then the panel's ranking Republican and laterits chairman.   With Reagan's election in 1980, Secretary of Haig, as secretaryof state, hired McFarlane as his military counselor. When Reagan in1982 named Undersecretary of State William P. Clark as his nationalsecurity adviser, McFarlane moved back to the White House asClark's deputy assistant.   Twenty-one months later, Clark decided he would rather beinterior secretary and McFarlane was elevated to the top nationalsecurity job.</TEXT></DOC>
