Principal and interest on the loan from Seven-Eleven Japan Co.Ltd., will be repaid from future royalties the company owesSouthland for use of the 7-Eleven name, Southland said Monday.   Of the loan proceeds, $300 million will be applied towardrepayment of debt incurred in the recently completed $4.9 billionleveraged buy-out, which took the company private, officials said.   ``What we're doing is borrowing against the value of futureroyalties so we can have cash in hand right now to repay moreexpensive debt that we incurred in the leveraged buy-out,'' saidSouthland spokeswoman Cecilia Norwood.   Seven-Eleven Japan opened its first store in Tokyo in 1974 andcurrently operates about 3,300 7-Eleven stores in Japan.   The $320 million _ 41 billion yen _ reflects more than 10 yearsworth of future royalties, Ms. Norwood said.

Area licenses and affiliates operate more than4,100 7-Eleven stores in 16 foreign countries.   Southland also owns half interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp.
