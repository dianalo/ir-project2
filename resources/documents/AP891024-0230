(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. Army claims Beretta USA is notliving up to its part of what has been called ``the pistol contractof the century,'' according to a published report.   In a terse ``show cause'' notice Aug. 2, the Army warned itcould cancel the contract with the Italian arms maker, its solesupplier of sidearms, because of production problems at Beretta'ssouthern Maryland plant, The (Baltimore) Sun reported Monday.   ``... Since you have failed to perform under the terms of (the)contract within the time required by its terms, the U.S. governmentis considering terminating the contract ... for default,'' thenotice said.   In June, the Army rejected a production lot of M9 9mmsemiautomatic pistols produced by the U.S. subsidiary of theItalian arms maker Beretta, causing the company to fall behind itsproduction schedule, Maj. Barry Bomier, an Army spokesman, saidlast week.   As of Oct. 1, Beretta had failed to deliver a total of 8,400guns, Bomier said. Under the terms of the contract, the company isrequired to deliver 6,000 guns a month, he said.   ``Pending a final decision in this matter, it will be necessaryto determine whether your failure to perform arose from causesbeyond your control and without fault or negligence on your part,''the notice to the company said. ``Your failure to present anyexcuses ... may be considered as an admission that none exist.''   Bomier said the Army does not plan to cancel the contract, butwants an explanation for the delay. A response was received fromthe company, but it was unsatisfactory, he said.   The Army decided in 1980 to replace the Colt 45 and otherhandguns with a standard 9mm pistol. The award to Beretta has beencalled ``the pistol contract of the century'' by some. Others,including some members of Congress, objected to the selection of aforeign company for the contract.   Jeffrey Reh, Beretta's contract officer, said the Army'sshow-cause notice prevented the firm from discussing contractualissues at length.   ``We consider the shortage to be due to relatively minor testingdifficulties,'' Reh said. ``One of them has been resolved, andwe're working to resolve the others.''   The Army said it rejected the lot in June because of possibledefects. Reh said the rejection was precautionary.   ``The problems weren't discovered in the field: this came up inpre-shipment testing,'' Reh said.   The Army, which buys the 9mm pistols for all military services,refused a lot of 500 guns because a sample weapon was found to havepossible hairline cracks in its frame, Bomier said.   Past problems with cracked frames forced the Army to reject atotal for 12,000 handguns from lots in December 1987 and January1988. The previous rejections prompted the company to redesign theM9 pistol frame.   A more serious defect that caused four injuries last yearprompted another design modification.</TEXT></DOC>
