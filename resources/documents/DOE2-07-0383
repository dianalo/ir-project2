Thissystem, the Moving Filter Radioactive Aerosol Monitor, collects particulatesin a conditioned sampling chamber, under computer control, for subsequentand separate alpha and beta counting and analysis. The alpha measurementis performed with a solid-state surface-barrier detector. Beta analysisis performed with a phoswich scintillation detector. A unique alpha-energyanalysis program that provides automatic energy calibration and lowereddetection limits for plutonium in the presence of high quantities ofinterfering {sup 212}Bi/Po is described. The {sup 212}Bi/Po alpha resultsare further used to monitor system quality and to compensate for theradon daughter beta components in the beta system. Results of the systemcalibration and detection limits are also presented. 8 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
