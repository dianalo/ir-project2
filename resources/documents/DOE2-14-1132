Five background electrolytes were usedat fixed voltages and time intervals. On the basis of the differentialmobilities of the ions, which depends on the ion-exchange propertiesof hydrous zirconium oxide and the nature of the complexes formed withthe electrolytes, some useful binary and ternary separations have beenachieved.
