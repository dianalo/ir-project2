Most of the activity is confined to the benthicenvironment within a distance of 50 km from the crash site of the B-52.Samplings of sediments, benthos, seaplants, fish, and water have beencarried out in 1968, 1970, 1974, 1979, and in 1984. The study presentedherein intends to answer the following questions: What is the mean residencetime of these transuranics in the benthic communities? Do Pu and Am behavedifferently in the environment? (author) 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
