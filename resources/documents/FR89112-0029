Background</ITAG>A. AuthorityOn January 16, 1981, as part of its final and interim final regulationsimplementing Section 3001 of RCRA, EPA published an amended list of hazardouswastes from non-specific and specific sources. This list has been amendedseveral times, and is published in 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32. These wastesare listed as hazardous because they typically and frequently exhibit oneor more of the characteristics of hazardous wastes identified in SubpartC of Part 261 (<T3>i.e., </T3>ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and extraction procedure(EP) toxicity) or meet the criteria for listing contained in 40 CFR 261.11(a)(2) or (a)(3).Individual waste streams may vary, however, depending on raw materials,industrial processes, and other factors. Thus, while a waste that is describedin these regulations generally is hazardous, a specific waste from an individualfacility meeting the listing description may not be. For this reason, 40CFR 260.20 and 260.22 provide an exclusion procedure, allowing personsto demonstrate that a specific waste from a particular generating facilityshould not be regulated as a hazardous waste.To have their wastes excluded, petitioners must show that wastes generatedat their facilities do not meet any of the criteria for which the wasteswere listed. See 40 CFR 260.22(a) and the background documents for thelisted wastes. In addition, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA)of 1984 require the agency to consider any factors (including additionalconstituents) other than those for which the waste was listed, if thereis a reasonable basis to believe that such additional factors could causethe waste to be hazardous. Accordingly, a petitioner also must demonstratethat the waste does not exhibit any of the hazardous waste characteristics(<T3>i.e., </T3>ignitability, reactivity, corrosivity, and EP toxicity),and must present sufficient information for the Agency to determine whetherthe waste contains any other toxicants at hazardous levels. See 40 CFR260.22(a), 42 U.S.C. 6921(f), and the background documents for the listedwastes. Although wastes which are ``delisted'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>excluded) have been evaluated to determine whether or notthey exhibit any of the characteristics of hazardous waste, generatorsremain obligated to determine whether or not their waste remains non-hazardousbased on the hazardous waste characteristics.In addition to wastes listed as hazardous in 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32,residues from the treatment, storage, or disposal of listed hazardous wastesand mixtures containing hazardous wastes also are eligible for exclusionand remain hazardous wastes until excluded. See 40 CFR 261.3 (c) and (d)(2).The substantive standard for ``delisting'' a treatment residue or a mixtureis the same as previously described for listed wastes.<T3>B. Approach Used To Evaluate This Petition</T3>In making a delisting determination, the Agency evaluates each petitionedwaste against the listing criteria and factors cited in 40 CFR 261.11 (a)(2)and (a)(3). If the Agency believes that the waste remains hazardous basedon the factors for which the waste was originally listed, EPA will proposeto deny the petition. If, however, the Agency agrees with the petitionerthat the waste is non-hazardous with respect to the original listing criteria,EPA then will evaluate the waste with respect to other factors or criteria,if there is a reasonable basis to believe that such additional factorscould cause the waste to be hazardous. The Agency considers whether thewaste is acutely toxic, and considers the toxicity of the constituents,the concentration of the constituents in the waste, their tendency to migrateand to bioaccumulate, their persistence in the environment once releasedfrom the waste, plausible and specific types of management of the petitionedwaste, the quantities of waste generated, and any other additional factorswhich may characterize the petitioned waste.The Agency is proposing to use such information to identify plausible exposureroutes for hazardous constituents present in the waste, and is proposingto use a particular fate and transport model to predict the concentrationof hazardous constituents that may be released from the petitioned wasteafter disposal and to determine the potential impact of the unregulateddisposal of Perox's petitioned waste on human health and the environment.Specifically, the model will be used to predict compliance-point concentrationswhich will be compared directly to the levels of regulatory concern forparticular hazardous constituents.EPA believes that this fate and transport model represents a reasonableworst-case waste disposal scenario for the petitioned waste, and that areasonable worst-case scenario is appropriate when evaluating whether awaste should be relieved of the protective management constraints of RCRASubtitle C. Because a delisted waste is no longer subject to hazardouswaste control, the Agency is generally unable to predict and does not controlhow a waste will be managed after delisting. Therefore, EPA currently believesthat it is inappropriate to consider extensive site-specific factors. Forexample, a generator may petition the Agency for delisting of a metal hydroxidesludge which is currently being managed in an on-site landfill and providedata on the nearest drinking water well, permeability of the aquifer, dispersivities,etc. If the Agency were to base its evalutation solely on these site-specificfactors, the Agency might conclude that the waste, at that specific location,cannot affect the closest well, and the Agency might grant the petition.Upon promulgation of the exclusion, however, the generator is under noobligation to continue to manage the waste at the on-site landfill. Infact, it is likely that the generator will either choose to send the delistedwaste off site immediately, or will eventually reach the capacity of theon-site facility which may have very different hydrogeological and exposureconditions.The Agency also considers the applicability of ground-water monitoringdata to its evaluation of delisting petitions. In this case, the agencydetermined that, because Perox utilizes off-site disposal of the petitionedwaste, ground-water monitoring data collected from the petitioner's facilitywould not characterize the effects of the petitioned waste on the underlyingaquifer at the off-site disposal facility. Therefore the Agency did notrequest ground-water monitoring data.Finally, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 specificallyrequire the Agency to provide notice and an opportunity for comment beforegranting or denying a final exclusion. Thus, a final decision will notbe made until all public comments (including those at requested hearings,if any) on today's proposal are addressed.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Disposition of Delisting Petition</ITAG>Perox, Incorporated, Sharon, Pennsylvania.1. Petition for ExclusionPerox, Incorporated (Perox), located in Sharon, Pennsylvania, operatesa spent hydrochloric acid pickle liquor regeneration plant for spent pickleliquor generated solely from steel finishing operations at Sharon SteelCorporation. Perox petitioned the Agency to exclude its iron oxide, producedas a by-product from the regeneration of spent pickle liquor, presentlylisted as EPA Hazardous Waste No. K062_``Spent pickle liquor generatedby steel finishing operations of facilities within the iron and steel industry(SIC Codes 331 and 332)''. The listed constituents for EPA Hazardous WasteNo. K062 are hexavalent chromium and lead. EPA Hazardous Waste No. K062is also classified as a corrosive waste under 40 CFR andSection; 261.30.Perox petitioned to exclude its waste because it does not believe thatthe waste meets the criteria of the listing. Perox also believes that itsiron oxide is non-hazardous because the constituents of concern, althoughpresent in the waste, are in an essentially immobile form. Perox furtherbelieves that the waste is not hazardous for any other reason (<T3>i.e.,</T3> there are no additional constituents or factors that couldcause the waste to be hazardous). Review of this petition included considerationof the original listing criteria, as well as the additional factors requiredby the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. See section 222 ofthe Amendments, 42 U.S.C. 6921(f), and 40 CFR 260.22(d)(2)-(4). Today'sproposal to grant this petition for delisting is the result of the Agency'sevaluation of Perox's petition.2. BackgroundPerox petitioned the Agency to exclude its iron oxide waste on March 27,1986 and subsequently provided additional information to complete its petition.In support of its petition, Perox submitted (1) a detailed descriptionof its hydrochloric acid regeneration process, including schematic diagrams;(2) total constituent and EP toxicity test results of the iron oxide forthe EP toxic metals and nickel; (3) analytical results of total cyanide;(4) iron oxide analysis data (<T3>e.g.,</T3> inorganic compounds, density and particle size measurements)for a six-month period; and (5) results from characteristics testing forignitability, corrosivity, and reactivity.Perox's regeneration process involves the separation of waste iron oxidefrom spent hydrochloric acid pickle liquor. Hydrochloric acid is used toremove mill scale and iron oxide rust from various steel products. Duringpickling, ferrous chloride forms in the pickle liquor. When this iron saltaccumulates to the extent that the acid is no longer useful for pickling,the spent acid must be replenished or regenerated.The resulting spent hydrochloric acid pickle liquor is regenerated usinga ``spray roaster'' process. In this process, waste pickle liquor is sprayedin a spray roaster, where ferrous chloride is converted to ferric oxideand hydrochloric acid in the vapor phase. Temperatures in the roaster varybetween 700 and 2,800 anddegrees;F. Iron oxide precipitate is dischargedfrom the base of the roaster and is transferred to a storage site. Hydrochloricacid is absorbed in the process water and recycled to the pickling line.The iron oxide precipitate is either milled and blended with other highergrade iron oxide and marketed as a raw material, or it is occasionallysent off site to a local hazardous waste landfill.To collect representative samples from processes like Perox's, petitionersare normally requested to collect a minimum of four composite samples composedof independent grab samples collected over time (<T3>e.g.,</T3> grab samples collected every hour and composited by shift).See ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Wastes: Physical/Chemical Methods,''U.S. EPA, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, Publication SW-846(third edition), November 1986, and ``Petitions to Delist Hazardous Wastes_AGuidance Manual,'' U.S. EPA, Office of Solid Waste, (EPA/530-SW-85-003),April 1985.Perox presented analytical data on four composite iron oxide samples. Eachcomposite sample was composed of four grab samples of iron oxide collectedfrom the roaster on each sampling date. The grab samples were collectedat 2-hour intervals on July 19, 1984, July 20, 1984, July 21, 1984 andJuly 22, 1984. Perox claims that all samples collected are representativeof any variation in the concentrations of the listed and non-listed constituentsof concern because the hydrochloric acid regeneration process used at thefacility is operated in a consistent manner. To support this claim, Peroxprovided data from a six-month compositional study of the iron oxide. Aspart of the study, Perox analyzed 86 waste samples for a number of metallicoxides (including lead and chromium oxide), density and particle size measurements.These study data show that the chromium oxide and lead oxide varied onlyfrom below detection to 0.0133 and 0.017 percent by weight, respectively.As noted earlier, Perox accepts spent hydrochloric acid solely from steelfinishing operations at Sharon Steel Corporation. Perox notes that anyvariations in steel are due only to variations in the carbon, silica and/orsulfur content of the steel. No significant variations occur with respectto any other hazardous or non-hazardous constituent. Perox further claimsthat no other wastes are mixed with the pickle liquor before it is sentto the regeneration plant. Thus, although Perox only collected four compositesamples of the iron oxide over a period of one week (<T3>i.e.,</T3> petitioners are normally requested to collect samples overa period of at least one month), EPA believes that these four samples,in conjunction with the six-month iron oxide composition information, arecapable of characterizing constituent concentrations in the iron oxide.3. Agency AnalysisPerox used test methods from ``Test Methods for Evalutating Solid Wastes:Physical/Chemical Methods,'' U.S. EPA, Office of Solid Waste and EmergencyResponse, Publication SW-846 (second edition) to evaluate the iron oxidesamples. SW-846 Methods 7060 through 7760 were used to quantify the totalconstituent concentrations (<T3>i.e.,</T3> mass of a particular constituent per mass of waste) of theEP toxic metals and nickel in the iron oxide. Method 9040 was used to quantifythe total cyanide content of the iron oxide. Method 1310 was used to determinethe extraction procedure (EP) leachable concentrations (<T3>i.e.,</T3> mass of a particular constituent per unit volume of extract)of the EP toxic metals and nickel in the iron oxide.Perox did not analyze the iron oxide for total sulfides. However, due tothe processes involved, the Agency does not believe that sulfides wouldbe present in the waste. The combination of the acid from the spent pickleliquor and the high temperatures in the roaster (700-2,800 anddegrees;F)would drive off any sulfides present in the iron oxide during the regenerationprocess.Table 1 presents the maximum total constituent concentrations of the EPtoxic metals, nickel, and cyanide. Table 2 presents the maximum EP leachatevalues of the EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanide. Detection limits representthe lowest concentrations quantifiable by Perox, when using the appropriateSW-846 analytical methods to analyze its waste. (Detection limits may varyaccording to the waste and waste matrix being analyzed, <T3>i.e.,</T3> the ``cleanliness'' of waste matrices varies and ``dirty''waste matrices may cause interferences, thus raising the detection limits.)<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Maximum Total Constituent Concentrations (ppm) Iron Oxide</T4><H1>Constituents </H1><H1>Total constituent concentrations</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic <D>1.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium <D>200</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>1,550</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>260</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury <D>0.45</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>270</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium <D>ND (0.5)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver <D>110</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanide <D>ND (0.5)</D><F>ND: Not Detected.

As such, the presence of those constituents would not be assessedusing the standard EP leachate procedure. See SW-846 Method 1330. For wasteswith more than one percent total oil and grease, the EP analyses must bemodified in accordance with the Oily Waste EP methodology.Perox did not analyze the iron oxide for total oil and grease content.However, the Agency does not believe the total oil and grease levels inthe waste would be of concern due to the high temperatures (700-2, 800anddegrees;F) in the spray roaster. The high temperatures would either vaporizeor oxidize any oil or grease present in the waste. Furthermore, staff undercontract to EPA (see discussion in Section 4) tested Perox's waste foroil and grease and detected only 0.0004 percent (4 ppm) oil and greasein the iron oxide. See SW-846 Method 1330. Perox provided test data indicating that the iron oxide does not exhibitthe properties of ignitability, corrosivity, or reactivity. See 40 CFR261.21, 261.22, and 261.23. Perox submitted a signed certification stating that, based on current annualwaste generation, their maximum annual generation rate of iron oxide is4,800 tons. The Agency reviews a petitioner's estimates and, on occasion,has requested a petitioner to re-evaluate estimated waste volume. EPA acceptsPerox's certified estimate of 4,800 tons (approximately 4,800 cubic yards).The Agency has initiated a spot-check sampling and analysis program toverify the representative nature of the data for some percentage of delistingpetitions. As part of this program, the Agency conducted a spot-check samplingvisit to Perox. The results of this visit, including chemical analysesof waste samples from Perox, are discussed later in this notice. 4. Agency EvaluationThe Agency considered the appropriateness of alternative disposal scenariosfor iron oxide wastes and decided that a landfill scenario is the mostreasonable, worst-case scenario for this waste, particularly since Peroxplans to dispose of this waste in an off-site landfill. Under a landfilldisposal scenario, the major exposure route of concern for any hazardousconstituents would be ingestion of contaminated ground water. The Agency,therefore, evaluated the petitioned waste using its vertical and horizontalspread (VHS) landfill model which predicts the potential for ground-watercontamination from wastes that are landfilled. See 50 FR 7882 (February26, 1985), 50 FR 48896 (November 27, 1985), and the RCRA public docketfor these notices for a detailed description of the VHS model and its parameters.This modeling approach, which includes a ground-water transport scenario,was used with conservative, generic parameters to predict reasonable worst-casecontaminant levels in ground water at a hypothetical receptor well (<T3>i.e.,</T3> the model estimates the ability of an aquifer to dilutethe toxicant from a specific volume of waste). The Agency requests commentson the use of VHS model as applied to the evaluation of Perox's waste.Specifically, the Agency used the VHS model to evaluate the mobility ofthe hazardous inorganic constituents detected in the EP extract of Perox'siron oxide (see Table 2). The Agency's evaluation, using Perox's estimateof 4,800 cubic yards per year and the maximum reported EP leachate concentrations,generated the compliance-point concentrations shown in Table 3. The Agencydid not evaluate the mobility of the remaining inorganic constituents (<T3>i.e.,</T3> arsenic, cadmium, mercury, selenium, and silver) from Perox'swaste because they were not detected in the EP extract using the appropriateSW-846 analytical methods. The Agency believes that it is inappropriateto evaluate non-detectable concentrations of a constituent of concern inits modeling efforts if the non-detectable value was obtained using theappropriate analytical method. Specifically, if a constituent cannot bedetected (when using the appropriate analytical method), the Agency assumesthat the constituent is not present and therefore does not present a threatto either human health or the environment. <ITAG tagnum="21"> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,10,8.2</C><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>VHS Model: Compliance-Point Concentrations (ppm) Iron Oxide </T4><H1>Constituents </H1><H1>Compliance-point concentrations </H1><H1>Levels of regulatory concern\1\</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Barium <D>0.063 </D><D>1.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>0.025 </D><D>0.05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.003 </D><D>0.05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>0.105 </D><D>0.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanide <D>0.004 </D><D>0.7 </D><F>\1\See ``Docket Report on Health-Based Regulatory Levels and SolubilitiesUsed in the Evaluation of Delisting Petitions,'' June 8, 1988, locatedin the RCRA public docket.</F></ITAG></ITAG> The iron oxide exhibited barium, chromium, lead, nickel, and cyanide levelsat the compliance point below the health-based levels used in delisting-decisionmaking. Furthermore, the Agency believes that the concentration of reactivecyanide will be below the Agency's interim standard of 250 ppm becausethe maximum reported concentration of total cyanide in the waste is lessthan 0.5 ppm. See ``Interim Agency Thresholds for Toxic Gas Generation,''July 12, 1985, Internal Agency Memorandum in the RCRA public docket. Lastly,because the regeneration process is likely to volatilize any sulfides thatmight be present in the iron oxide, the Agency believes that the concentrationof reactive sulfide will be below the Agency's interim standard of 500ppm. See ``Interim Agency Thresholds for Toxic Gas Generation,'' July 12,1985, Internal Agency Memorandum in the RCRA public docket. The Agency concluded, after reviewing Perox's processes, that no otherhazardous constituents of concern are being used by Perox and that no otherconstituents of concern are likely to be present or formed as reactionproducts or by-products in Perox's waste. In addition, based on test resultsprovided by Perox, pursuant to 40 CFR 260.22, the Agency does not believethat Perox's waste exhibits any of the characteristics of ignitability,corrosivity, or reactivity. Ignitability is not expected to be a problembecause the iron oxide is the product of a high temperature (700-2,800anddegrees;F) roasting process. Corrosivity is not expected to be a problembecause the iron oxide is not a liquid. Reactivity is not expected to bea problem because the iron oxide is not believed to contain reactive cyanideor reactive sulfide above the Agency's thresholds for these constituents.See 40 CFR 261.21, 261.22, and 261.23, respectively. On April 28, 1987, staff under contract to the Agency conducted a sitevisit to Perox as part of the Agency's spot-check sampling and analysisprogram. Four samples of iron oxide were taken from the spray roaster andthe storage silo at the facility: One sample was collected directly intoa wide-mouth jar as the iron oxide fell from the roaster; one sample wastaken from the silo by inserting a sampling tool into the pipe at the siloentry port; and two samples were taken from the base of the silo by a Peroxemployee and transferred to wide mouth jars and two vials. The sampleswere analyzed according to EPA test methods by a laboratory under contractto EPA. EP toxicity analyses of the EP toxic metals were conducted usingSW-846 Method 1310. Total cyanide was analyzed using SW-846 Method 9010.Analytical difficulties were encountered during total metal analyses ofthe spot-check samples. These data, therefore, were not considered in theAgency's review of Perox's petition. (See the RCRA public docket for today'snotice for more detail.) The samples were evaluated according to routinespot-check procedure for the presence of Priority Pollutant organics usingSW-846 Methods 8270, 8080, and 8240. Other hazardous constituents (<T3>e.g., </T3>those listed in 40 CFR Part 261, Appendix VIII) were notanalyzed because the iron oxide is not expected to contain any organics.No organic constituents of concern were detected in the samples. Table 4 presents the maximum reported EP leachate concentrations valuesof the EP toxic metals, antimony, beryllium, nickel, and cyanide.    <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,15</C><T4>Table </T4>4._<T4>Maximum EP Leachate Concentrations (ppm) (Spot-Check Samples Iron Oxide</T4><H1/><T3>Constituents </T3><H1/><T3>EP leachate concentrations</T3><ITAG tagnum="1">Antimony <D>ND (0.25)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic <D>ND (0.25)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium <D>ND (2)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Beryllium <D>ND (0.005)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>ND (0.05)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>ND (0.2)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>ND (0.25)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury <D>ND (0.001)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>0.53</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium <D>ND (0.02)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver <D>ND (0.0025)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanide <D>andless;0.012 \1\</D><F>ND: Not Detected.

None of these constituents, therefore,is of regulatory concern.5. ConclusionThe Agency believes that Perox has successfully demonstrated that the regenerationprocess used at its facility renders the KO62 waste non-hazardous. TheAgency believes that the four samples collected by Perox from the roaster,in conjunction with the six-month iron oxide composition information, werenon-biased and adequately represent any variations that may occur in theiron oxide. Data from Perox's six-month compositional study showed thatthe chromium oxide and lead oxide varied only from below detection to 0.0133and 0.017 percent by weight, respectively. Furthermore, Perox notes thatthe spent hydrochloric acid is accepted only from Sharon Steel Corporation,and that no other wastes are mixed with the acid prior to shipment to Peroxfor regeneration. Based on the information and on the data from the six-monthcompositional study, the Agency believes that the samples of iron oxidecollected and analyzed reflect the day-to-day variations in Perox's regenerationprocess. The Agency, therefore, is proposing that Perox's waste be considerednon-hazardous, as it should not present a hazard to either human healthor the environment. The Agency proposes to grant an exclusion to Perox,Incorporated, located in Sharon, Pennsylvania, for its iron oxide describedin its petition as EPA Hazardous Waste No. KO62. If the proposed rule becomeseffective, the iron oxide would no longer be subject to regulation under40 CFR Parts 262 through 268 and the permitting standards of 40 CFR Part270.If made final, this exclusion will apply only to the processes coveredby the original demonstration. The facility would require a new exclusionif either its manufacturing or regeneration processes are altered and accordinglywould need to file a new petition. The facility must treat waste generatedfrom changed processes as hazardous until a new exclusion is granted.Although management of the waste covered by this petition would be relievedfrom Subtitle C jurisdiction upon final promulgation of an exclusion, thegenerator of a delisted waste must either treat, store, or dispose of thewaste in an on-site facility, or ensure that the waste is delivered toan off-site storage, treatment, or disposal facility, either of which ispermitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage municipal or industrialsolid waste. Alternatively, the delisted waste may be delivered to a facilitythat beneficially uses or reuses, or legitimately recycles or reclaimsthe waste, or treats the waste prior to such beneficial use, reuse, recyclingor reclamation.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Effective Date  </ITAG>This rule, if promulgated, will become effective immediately. The Hazardousand Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 amended Section 3010 of RCRA to allowrules to become effective in less than six months when the regulated communitydoes not need the six-month period to come into compliance. That is thecase here, because this rule, if promulgated, would reduce the existingrequirements for persons generating hazardous wastes. In light of the unnecessaryhardship and expense that would be imposed on this petitioner by an effectivedate six months after promulgation and the fact that a six-month deadlineis not necessary to achieve the purpose of Section 3010, EPA believes thatthis exclusion should be effective immediately upon promulgation. Thesereasons also provide a basis for making this rule effective immediately,upon promulgation, under the Administrative Procedures Act, pursuant to5 U.S.C. 553(d).  <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact  </ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This proposal to grant an exclusion is not major, since its effect, ifpromulgated, would be to reduce the overall costs and economic impact ofEPA's hazardous waste management regulations. This reduction would be achievedby excluding waste generated at a specific facility from EPA's lists ofhazardous wastes, thereby enabling this facility to treat its waste asnon-hazardous. There is no additional impact, therefore, due to today'srule. This proposal is not a major regulation, therefore, no RegulatoryImpact Analysis is required.  <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Flexibility Act  </ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, wheneveran agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (<T3>i.e.,</T3> small businesses, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, that the rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.  This amendment, if promulgated, will not have an adverse economic impacton small entities since its effect would be to reduce the overall costsof EPA's hazardous waste regulations and would be limited to one facility.Accordingly, I hereby certify that this proposed regulation, if promulgated,will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. This regulation, therefore, does not require a regulatoryflexibility analysis.  <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Paperwork Reduction Act  </ITAG>Information collection and recordkeeping requirements associated with thisproposed rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub.L. 96-511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) and have been assigned OMB Control Number2050-0053.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 261  </ITAG>Hazardous materials, Waste treatment and disposal, Recycling.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 3, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffery D.
