SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sharp cuts in the use of fossil fuels like oil,gas and coal are necessary to help prevent climate change that couldcause dangerous overheating of the earth, a leading scientist warnedSaturday.   George M. Woodwell, director of the Woods Hole Research Center,told a conference at the Smithsonian Institution that restrictionson the use of fossil fuels, an end to deforestation and a start onreforestation ``are essential.''   ``We are failing foolishly and dangerously'' to deal withenvironmental threats, Woodwell said at the conference on ``TheGlobal Environment, Are We Overreacting.''   Woodwell focused largely on the so-called Greenhouse effect, thethreat of global warming which many scientists fear will result fromthe continued introduction of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.   A colorless, odorless gas, carbon dioxide allows warmth from thesun to continue heating the Earth, but keeps portions of the Earth'swarmth from radiating out into space.   The result, many researchers fear, will be an overheating of theplanet, changing climate and possibly seriously damaging crops andother forms of life.   Asked for a solution, Woodwell said: ``Well, you do some prettystraightforward things. You reduce the release of fossil fuel carboninto the atmosphere by restricting the use of fossil fuel. How much?Maybe all of it. ... You stop deforestation and you startreforestation.''   Paul R. Ehrlich of Stanford University suggested that Americansshould be paying at least $2.30-a-gallon for gasoline, sinceautomobiles and trucks are a major carbon dioxide source.   ``If it didn't cut consumption, it would at least reduce thedeficit,'' said Ehrlich, referring to the additional money thatwould be raised by taxing gasoline to raise the price to that level.   While scientists have measured a 25 percent increase inatmospheric carbon dioxide over the last century, debate continuesabout the Greenhouse warming and whether it can yet be measured.   Several scientists have urged a wait-and-see attitude, contendingthat natural fources such as increased cloudiness could restorebalance to the planet.   ``Most of the projections about the future are not verifiablewithout performing an experiment, and it gets performed on guesswhat laboratory?'' said Stephen Schneider of the National Center forAtmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.   Gene E. Likens of the New York Botanical Gardens pointed out thatdangerous air pollution has become so common that scientists havebegun speaking of ``pollution climates'' in some areas, particularlyparts of the United States, Europe and Asia.   ``Chemicals released into the air come back to us in the form ofrainout or fallout. The point is, what goes up does come down, andsometimes it travels great distances before it does so,'' addedBruce A. Fowler of the University of Maryland.</TEXT></DOC>
