It seems to me that a production programmust work.andP;  No matter how ambitious the design, no matter what tricks havebeen used, no matter how good the user interface, if a program fails in use,it is badly made.andP;  Such failures need not be debilitating to make the programunusable--if a user spends five minutes thinking of a work-around and forgetshis place in his job, that bug has cost perhaps half an hour of real time.andM;There are people who have built their careers on explaining why a programnever be made completely clean.andP;  They wrong; it is possible to write cleanprograms, but not if you're writing in C. The C supporters claim that one isallowed access to the most secret parts of the machine, I agree, and I thinkthis is a laudable feature in a language; my complaint is that one doesn'thave the option not to.andP;  One can't think in terms of metaphors: one has toallocate memory explicitly, pass around its addresses explicitly, thendeallocate it when one is sure one has finished with it.andP;  Every C programmerknows what happens when memory is deallocated prematurely; the resultanterrors propagate around the computer until even the operating system isdestroyed.andP;  How can anyone defend the concept of a compilable program beingable to crash the operating system?andM;Computers were created to do boring, repetitive and precise jobs that arebeneath human dignity.andP;  Jobs like turning references to reals into referencesto doubles.andP;  jobs like checking that a variable passed by reference is notreceived by value.andP;  jobs like deciding whether memory is in use or not.andP;  jobslike making sure that a program stays decently within the bounds that theoperating system gives it.andP;  C, you will notice, does none of these things.andO;The existence of programs such as lint, which takes a compilable program andtells you what you have done that is dangerous, is tacitly acknowledging thefaults of the language.andP;  It is intrinsic to the language that you can passalmost any rubbish through the stack- the assumption is made that theprogrammer is able to take appropriate care at the receiving end, even whenthe receiver is in a different file from the sender -- the actual file notbeing obvious from any piece of code, but with perhaps 50 to choose from on asignificant project.andM;As if this were not enough, C programmers claim with perfectly straight facesthat a language which is advertised as providing unequalled control over thedeep levels of the machine (apparently to the detriment of all civilisedbehaviour), also produces code which is inherently portable.andP;  I do notunderstand a mind capable of believing both of these concepts at the sametime.andM;Why is C so popular? Why would anyone actually want to write a program in it,and how does one get such a program to work?andM;Jules May is a freelance programmer specialising in graphics and HCI.andP;  Healso runs Jules Computer Ltd, a company marketing a 3D graphics sub-systemwhich runs on a range of machines.andP;  In 10 years of programming, he has onlyproduced one bug.andP;  He can be contacted on 0707 44185.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
