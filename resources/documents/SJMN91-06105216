Is this among the perks offered by the cities to receive the tournament,and, if so, what happens to the floor after the tournament is completed?;Scott Scharlau, Santa Clara  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  (NOT SO) DUMB QUESTIONS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     A The floors are custom made. The NCAA contracts Horner Flooring of DollarBay, Mich., to design the floors, which are then sold to various buyers at acost of $60,000 at the tournament's conclusion.;    Some buyers change thefloor design, others don't. When Kansas City's Kemper Arena, which hosted the1988 Final Four, purchased the floor that year, it retained the originaldesign until this year.;    A national marketing company bought this year'sfloor, cut it into 5 1/2 by 6 1/2 blocks, laser etched the names of the FinalFour teams on each square and sold them to the general public as souvenirs for$24.95 a square. For 22,000 at $24.95, the firm made a nifty $488,000 profit.;   The NCAA was not pleased, and is considering banning potential buyers whointend to make a profit off the floors.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910414  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DIAGRAM  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  207  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday April 14, 199100105216,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
