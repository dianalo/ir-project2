Hundreds were reported arrested and ateen-age boy was shot to death.   At least 19 people were reported injured.   Pinochet, who commands the army and took part in the selectionprocess, was widely expected to be nominated. After his selection,he announced that the referendum will be held Oct. 5.   Anti-Pinochet demonstrations raged in Santiago and severalcities during the day and grew more violent after the nominationwas announced. In the capital, protesters hurled rocks, burnedbuses and clashed with police and with Pinochet supporters.   A hospital spokesman told The Associated Press by telephone that15-year-old Erickson Palma was shot twice in the chest in aresidential neighborhood of southwest Santiago.   The spokesman said a 14-year-old boy also was wounded, and RadioCooperativa reported that he also was shot from a passing car. Thestation said a third person, an adult, also was wounded by a bullet.   Local radio reports said the youths were participating in apot-banging protest called by the opposition when they were hit byshots fired from a passing car.   At 8 p.m., windows opened throughout Santiago and residentsbanged pots and pans to show their displeasure with the nomination.The show of defiance was organized by a 16-party oppositioncoalition.   Also, evening blackouts were reported in Santiago suburbs bothnorth and south of the city, as well as in the coastal city of LaSerena 290 miles north of the capital.   Authorities did not disclose the cause of the power losses, butbombing of power transmission towers is commonly carried out byleftist guerrilla groups to protest government actions.   Local radio stations reported protesters clashing with police inSantiago's outlying slums during the night. The demonstratorserected barricades of burning car tires to prevent police fromentering the neighborhoods.   Protests began nationwide about noon, when the military leadersconvened to formally choose Pinochet for a the presidentialreferendum.   A police spokesman, Capt. Alejandro Sierra, said 19 people wereinjured during the Santiago disturbances. Two police officers wereamong the injured, one of whom was reported in serious condition,Sierra said.   He said police detained 364 protesters who would be heldovernight and then released. He said they included a U.S. citizen,but said authorities would not release his name or that of any ofthe other people arrest.   He said four public buses were set afire and destroyed bydemonstrators, who also hurled rocks at police. There were briefclashes between groups of pro- and anti-Pinochet civilian groups.   If voters approve Pinochet, 72, his term will run until 1997. Ifthe voters reject him, open elections are to be held in 1990 andPinochet will remain president until then.   ``This is a decisive moment in the institutional process begunSept. 11, 1973,'' Pinochet said in his acceptance speech.   Pinochet led the bloody coup in September 1973 that ousted thegovernment of Marxist President Salvador Allende, who died in thepalace takeover. Pinochet has been president of the militarygovernment since then.   Pinochet was nominated by himself, navy chief Adm. Jose Merino,air force leader Gen. Fernando Matthei and national police directorGen. Rodolfo Stange in a one-hour 45-minute nomination session inthe Defense Ministry.   Pinochet later appeared on a balcony of the government palaceand addressed about 10,000 cheering supporters.   He said his years of rule have been dedicated to forging aChilean society in which a new type of democracy, with toughsafeguards against communism, will be established.   ``The full democracy that approaches constitutes a new challengefor everyone,'' he said. ``It also will demand of us allovercoming, adapting and rectifying to create a new style ofpolitical coexistence,'' he said.   Pinochet is backed by his army, which is by far the mostpowerful military service, and has campaigned for months forpopular support.   Opposition politicians immediately denounced the selection.   ``The nomination of Gen. Pinochet, with his own vote, ascandidate to succeed himself, is the best denial of the supposeddemocratic intentions of the regime,'' the centrist DemocraticParty said in a written statement.   Pinochet's nomination was announced by air force Gen. EnriqueMontero, secretary for the nominating session.   He said the commanders designated Pinochet ``as the person who,pending citizen ratification, occupies the position of president ofthe republic for the (eight-year) presidential period beginningMarch 11, 1989.''   There were anti-government demonstrations in downtown Santiagoand also in Conception and Osorno in the south and and in thecentrl port city of Valparaiso.   More than a thousand youths marched through downtown Santiagoand riot police sent them fleeing with tear gas and water cannons.But the protesters regrouped and continued their marches during theafternoon.   Some of the demonstrators carried pictures of leftists whodisappeared after being arrested by security agents. Beneath thepictures were the words: ``Where are they?.''   Police said several bomb threats had been receivwed and theydeactivated two explosive devices, one left in a black plastic baga block from the government house.   More than 7.2 million Chile's 8 million elegible voters haveregistered to participate in the referendum.</TEXT></DOC>
