This will be as the result of not only government legislationon product qualities but also shifts in consumer demands as well as changesin feedstock qualities and availabilities. The most significant of thesechanges will be the removal of lead additive from gasoline blends. Obviouslythe next 5 to 10 years will see a great deal of activity in the refiningindustry in keeping up with the demands of the public through governmentregulation and consumer needs. No one solution will be the best fit forall facilities. Each refiner will use combinations of various activitiesto provide the best solution for the individual refineries. Once thedust has settled in the mid-1990's it will likely become clear who hasbeen the most effective at handling the major transitions. The leaderwill be the one who has learned best to adapt, to anticipate changesto the market, and to move quickly to follow the requirements of themarket.</TEXT></DOC>
