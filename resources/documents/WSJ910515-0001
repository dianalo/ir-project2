Rio Algom, which owns about 27% of Uranium Resourcesassuming the exercise of warrants, disclosed in a filing withthe Securities and Exchange Commission that it met withrepresentatives of Uranium Resources last week. A Rio Algomspokesman called the talks &quot;very exploratory.&quot; TheToronto-based company hasn't yet tabled a takeover proposal,he said.</LP><TEXT>   An executive for Uranium Resources, based in Dallas, addedthat price wasn't discussed at the meeting. He said furtherdiscussions with Rio could take place in the future.   Rio Algom, a mining and metals distribution concern,agreed in principle in late 1989 to acquire Uranium Resourcesfor about $66 million, but the deal was subsequently calledoff.   Rio Algom, which is 51% owned by RTZ Corp. of Britain,produces 1.2 million pounds of uranium a year at itsfacilities in Ontario. Analysts say the company's productioncosts are at least $30 a pound, roughly three times thecurrent uranium spot market price. On the other hand, UraniumResources' operations in Texas are below $8 a pound, owinglargely to a solution-mining technology that literallydissolves the mineral from the ore while it is still in theground. The company currently produces about 1 million poundsof uranium a year.   In over-the-counter trading, Uranium Resources sharesclosed yesterday at $7.25, up $1. On the American StockExchange, Rio Algom shares finished unchanged at $13.375.</TEXT></DOC>
