Military officials said the move was in response to a markeddecline in violent incidents in the disputed territories in thelast few weeks.   On Sunday, however, three Palestinians died in one of the worstdays of violence in the occupied territories this month.   ``If they (the children) are in school then they won't be in thestreets, but that is not what motivated us to open the schools,''Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, head of the army's Civil Administrationwhich runs daily affairs in the West Bank, told army radio today.   ``The whole education system was examined. Teachers who wereconnected with the rioting are not teachers today,'' he said.   The Supreme Court today heard an appeal by Mubarak Awad, anArab-American advocate of civil disobedience, who asked the panelto scrap a deportation order against him. The court said it wouldrule at a later date.   The government jailed Awad earlier this month and said he wouldbe expelled for playing a leading role in the Arab uprising. But intoday's arguments, prosecutor Nili Arad said deportationproceedings began mainly because Awad violated immigration laws.   Awad, born in Arab east Jerusalem, spent 15 years in the UnitedStates and became a U.S. citizen before returning to Jerusalem in1985.   His attorney, Avraham Gal, said immigration laws did not applyto his client and other Arab residents of east Jerusalem annexed byIsrael after the 1967 Middle East War.   Also today, Israel radio reported the government charged twoeditors of the newspaper Derech Hanitzotz with being members of aterrorist organization and having contacts with foreign agents.   Roni Ben Efrat and Michal Shwartz were jailed pending trial andcould face up to 40 years if convicted.   The government said the two women were recruited to start thepro-Palestinian newspaper by the Democratic Front for theLiberation of Palestine, a radical PLO faction. The radio said fourother journalists for the Hebrew-language paper also were jailedbut but not yet charged.   In the West Bank, elementary school girls in gray-stripeduniforms and boys in street clothes could be seen trudging theroads to schools.   The army said high schools in the territories will open nextweek if the relative calm persists.   Israel television reported some classes would resume today atGaza's Islamic University, a key site of protests when the Arabuprising began on Dec. 8. More than 190 Arabs have been killedsince the uprising started. An Israeli soldier and an Israelisettler also were killed.   The Israeli army shut nearly 1,200 schools in Gaza and the WestBank on Feb. 2, at the height of unrest, keeping about 475,000Palestinian children and teen-agers away from their classrooms.   On Sunday, city officials reopened 31 public schools inIsraeli-annexed East Jerusalem. Up to 70 percent of 16,000 studentsattended classes, which proceeded without disruption, said AmirCheshin, the city's adviser on Arab Affairs.   Hussein Shurie, director of a private college in El Bireh, saidhe knew of many teachers who gave private lessons for studentsduring the long closure.   He noted that leaflets put out by underground leaders of theuprising urged students to return to school. ``They think it is oneof the aims of the `intefadeh' (uprising) _ to be educated,'' hesaid.   On Sunday, a Palestinian mother and son died when their carcaught fire from a firebomb near the West Bank city of Tulkarem, 65miles northwest of Jerusalem, military and Arab sources said.   The bombing occurred as Shamshe Kadah, 65, and Mohammed SalahGhanem, 36, drove home after leaving Ghanem's wife at TulkaremHospital where she later gave birth to a girl, hospital officialssaid.   Israeli military sources and Arabs in Shuweika village nearTulkarem said the firebomb was apparently thrown by Arabs aiming atan Israeli army jeep.   Also Sunday, Kawther Miri, 23, died of a bullet wound sufferedduring a weekend clash with troops at a refugee camp in Tulkarem,hospital officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
