Land costs weren't a barrier to expansion, as in itsformer home of Palo Alto, Calif. Housing was at a price thatthe company's young work force could afford. Taxes were low,both for the employees and the owners. And the area was a hubfor one-day trucking to the prosperous greater Northwest.   For Clarkson, which specializes in valves used for mining,northern Nevada had the added attraction of a booming goldindustry, revitalized astride what, a century after theComstock Lode, are again the nation's top fields. Althoughactivity has tapered off with weakness in gold prices overthe past year, direct employment in the local industry istriple what it was in 1985, according to John Dobra, aneconomist and consultant. Mr. Dobra calculates that theindirect effect, as reflected at businesses such as Clarkson,has been even greater.</LP><TEXT>   Not everything in this more-established but less-visiblepart of Nevada took off in the past decade, a period when thestate, led by its burgeoning south, was the fastest growingin the nation. Reno-Sparks suffered overhang in its gamingbusiness and actually grew more slowly in population than inthe 1970s. This is one of many differences with the Las Vegasarea, which is now twice as populous and effectively existsin a separate regional economy from the northern belt.   Nevada gambling began in the north and still is importanthere, but few travel far to this part of the state. It hasrelied on proximity to the San Francisco Bay Area forvisitors and for businesses fleeing high-price, high-taxCalifornia. It has two-thirds of the state's manufacturingemployment. Mining is the highest paid of any majoremployment category. This region thus may be more affected bythe fiscal debate that has occupied state officials in nearbyCarson City for most of this year.   The governor and legislators seem intent on raising about$300 million in taxes over two years, though they can'tsettle on how to pay the bill. If they exempt gaming -- whichalready carries 40% of the state load -- it means about a 20%boost for the rest of the economy. The governor wants a 1%payroll levy, which smells of income taxation in a state thathas avoided that. The Legislature drifts between a differenttype of business charge and a boost in sales taxes, whichwouldn't be as steady an income source should the long-luckystate get dealt a bad hand. California Gov. Pete Wilson'sproposed leap in sales taxes gives Nevada cover to takesimilar action.   As might be expected, all sides are pointing in someoneelse's direction. Organized business interests seem mostaverse to the payroll tax, which could require an intrusivecollection apparatus where one hasn't been needed. The miningindustry, for its part, was hit two years ago with stifferstate levies on top of longtime local taxes, and argues it isat a constitutional maximum. The casinos, with theirextraordinary influence in Carson City -- the venerableOrmsby House, for instance, is cater-corner to the capitol --appear safe from another increase.   For a business such as Clarkson, the effect of a big boostin general business taxes wouldn't be critical but could beenough to cost one job from the 72-person payroll. Thenonunion operation pays from $7 to $14 an hour, according toVice President Omer King.   Nevada has a spending problem because of a school-agedemographic bulge, including at the state university whereenrollment controls have been lax. The incarceration rate percapita is the highest in the U.S. -- 11% of those in stateprison are there for driving while intoxicated -- and itspolice forces are outsized. And its low population base,separated by great distances, has meant high overhead coststhat seem only to get worse as more people come. Chambers ofcommerce are urging some progress on privatization and onconsolidation of services in areas such as Reno and Sparks,whose separation is an historical artifact.   Local government continues to have a wild streak. Themayor of Reno, whose wife appeared in Playboy, was re-electedlast week, while the mayor of Sparks was ousted by a formersportscaster. The elections, with a turnout of 58%, signaledopposition to growth, notwithstanding the relative pause ofthe '80s and the fact that shelter is already so tight thatthe job-hungry, who traditionally flock to Nevada in toughtimes, rent cheap motel rooms by the week. Despite apersistent water shortage (no wonder -- it's unmetered), aplan to buy rights from lands to the north are threatenedbecause residents think the water will encourage new casinosto blossom.   Although Las Vegas has four times the number of guestrooms as Reno/Sparks and pulls in six times the gamblingrevenue in its still-surging betting palaces, tourism remainsvital to Truckee Meadows as well. The north is hobbled bylack of traffic through Reno's Cannon Airport, which grewonly 20% from 1980-90, while at Las Vegas's McCarran Aiportit doubled. Washoe County (Reno) is blessed with an unusuallylarge Latino population by Nevada standards -- nearly 10% --that shores up its work force. In another curious contrastwith Las Vegas, the black share of the Washoe population isonly a fifth as large.   The cowboy culture survives in Reno, where an annual rodeois a major event. It lives on, too, in the high-risk,high-reward quest for gold in the hills. These days, someprospectors are big operators; too big, some think, in thecase of Newmont Mining and American Barrick, which plan tomerge. Side players, such as the Clarkson Co., also plan togrow. Vice President Hank Frohlich describes how the company,now at $14 million in annual sales and an accomplishedexporter, is vertically integrating production so it candevelop new rubberlike compounds for its valves.   Nevada's future prosperity, once gambling cools off, mayrest on maintaining an environment that fostersprivate-sector expansion. Some believe this entails publicexpenditures such as the mining program at the University ofNevada-Reno, said to be among the best half-dozen in thecountry. Just as likely a contributor, however, is thelow-tax regime that until lately has placed the state secondonly to New Hampshire as a safe haven for earnings andwealth. Maintaining that mark of distinction means governmenthas to keep its hands off the chips.</TEXT></DOC>
