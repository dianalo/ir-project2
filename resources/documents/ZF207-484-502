 MANs canact as digital backbone networks, providing an interconnection between homes,small businesses and corporate LANs.andP;  By design, they will also accommodatethe integration of voice, video and data traffic.andP;  MAN media choices includeoptical fiber, CATV coaxial cable and radio transmission.andP;  The generalcharacteristics of a MAN include:andM;* Very high data rates, in excess of 100M bits per second.andM;* Large geographic scope, from a few to several hundred kilometers.andM;* Many stations, theoretically any number, but practically limited to about1,000.andM;* Low error rate, less than one bit error every [10.sup.9] bits.andM;The concept for metropolitan area networks was clearly derived from LANs,although LAN technology is not applicable to MANs.andP;  In large part, this isdue to the inherent inefficiencies in most LAN Medium Access Control (MAC)schemes.andP;  Contention schemes (e.g., Carrier Sense Multiple Access withCollision Detection, or CSMA/CD), for example, have idle time on the line dueto collisions and/or backoff; token passing has idle time on the medium dueto the required circulation of the token.andP;  These &quot;inefficiencies&quot; have arelatively low impact on LAN performance due to the relatively small size ofthe network.andP;  They would have significantly greater impact on MANs, however,due to their larger geographic scope.andP;  MAN MAC schemes, then, are similar,but different, from LAN MAC schemes.andM;A high-speed local network (HSLN, or HSLAN in some sources) is also basedupon LAN technology and concepts.andP;  HSLNs, however, are less general-purposethan an ordinary LAN.andP;  HSLNs are typically used as a backbone network tointerconnect a small number of high-speed devices and peripherals in arelatively small area.andP;  A common HSLN application would be to interconnectseveral mainframe computers and peripherals within a computer room.andM;HSLN characteristics include:andM;* High data rates, in excess of 50M bits per second.andM;* Very small geographic scope, usually no more than several hundred meters.andM;* Few stations, often limited to 50 or so attachments.andM;* Low error rate, less than one bit error every [10.sup.11] bits.andM;HSLN media choices include coaxial cable and optical fiber.andP;  LAN MAC schemesare not directly applicable to HSLNs due to their small geographic scope,small number of devices, and high speed.andP;  Most HSLN standards and productsusing some sort of token-passing strategy on a bus topology (but not IEEE802.4 token-passing bus schemes).andM;The Role of ANSIandM;Most readers are probably familiar with the LAN standards being created bythe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802 committee,but less familiar with ANSI LAN/MAN standards.andP;  ANSI does not createstandards, per se.andP;  Instead, they have defined the standards creation process(the standard's standard, if you will) and they oversee this process in theUS.andP;  ANSI certifies other organizations to write US national standards inseveral areas.andM;The ANSI X3-series standards, for example, are the American NationalStandards for Information Processing Systems.andP;  The Computer and BusinessEquipment Manufacturers Association (CBEMA) coordinates the work of the X3committee, which is responsible for writing the X3 standards.andP;  The X3T9subcommittee is responsible for creating standards dealing with I/OInterfaces.andP;  The X3T9.5 Task Group is specifically chartered to write theFDDI MAN standard, as well as the Local Distributed Data Interface (LDDI), ahigh-speed local network (HSLN) standard.andM;ANSI is generally responsible for networking standards operating at speeds inexcess of 20M bits per second.andP;  In addition to the X3T9.5 work, ANSI jointlyadopts the IEEE 802 standards as they are approved.andP;  One of the reasons forthis is that once approved as US national standards, they can be forwarded tothe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for possibleadoption as international standards.andP;  IEEE local networking standardsgenerally address operation at speeds of 20M bits per second or less.andP;  (TheIEEE is also working on a MAN standard; more on this later.)andM;FDDI OverviewandM;As mentioned above, FDDI was designed by the ANSI X3T9.5 Task Group.andP;  It isdesigned to provide a high bandwidth general-purpose interconnection betweencomputers and peripherals, including the interconnection of LANs and othernetworks.andM;FDDI uses a MAC scheme based loosely on the IEEE 802.5 Token Ring.andP;  It usesan optical fiber medium and ring topology, operating at a data rate of 100Mbits per second.andP;  FDDI can sustain an effective data transfer rate of 80Mbits per second.andP;  The standard assumes up to 1,000 physical attachments tothe MAN, with a total fiber path of up to 200 kilometers (km).andP;  One of themost important aspects of FDDI is its ability to dynamically allocatebandwidth so that both a synchronous and asynchronous service can be providedsimultaneously.andM;Synchronous service is required for delay-sensitive applications which musthave a guaranteed bandwidth and response time.andP;  Unlike traffic in astore-and-forward data network, additional delay cannot be added by thenetwork for this type of service.andP;  Voice traffic is delay-sensitive because aperiod of silence in a voice conversation conveys meaning.andP;  Therefore, avoice network cannot add a nonconstant delay to the spoken words because thatwould change the meaning of the words.andP;  Digital voice needs 8,000 samples persecond, where a sample is taken (and delivered) every 125 microseconds.andO;Voice, video, and real-time data traffic are delay-sensitive.andM;Asynchronous service is for delay-insensitive traffic, such as interactiveuser data.andP;  For example, if a user is connected to a host and issues the DIRcommand, the meaning of the command is no different if it arrives in 0.5 or5.0 seconds (although the user's frustration level will differ!).andP;  This classof service does not have the same bandwidth and response time guarantees assynchronous service.andM;(Note: The terms synchronous and asynchronous are used throughout thisarticle to refer to traffic and services that are delay-sensitive anddelay-insensitive, respectively.andP;  They must not be confused with synchronousand asynchronous transmission on the physical medium, which refers to theinter-character timing of a transmission.)andM;Three major application environments have been defined in the FDDI standard.andO;The Data Center Environment, or back-end network (e.g., HSLN), ischaracterized by a relatively small number of stations, most of which aremainframe computers and high-speed peripheral devices.andP;  Reliability,high-speed and fault-tolerance are essential.andP;  This environment assumes afiber length of no more than 400 meters between two communicating stations.andM;The Office/Building Environment, or front-end network, is characterized byboth a relatively large number of single attachment stations (singleattachment is described below) and by the use of a star-wiring scheme.andP;  Thestations will typically be minicomputers, communications concentrators,workstations, PCs and peripheral equipment that are attached to the FDDInetwork via a wiring concentrator.andP;  The use of the concentrator allows easierstar wiring and also accommodates the fact that most of the stations on thisnetwork are powered down on a frequent basis by their users.andP;  Since wiringconcentrators are never powered down, the integrity of the network ismaintained when individual stations are shut off.andM;Finally, the Campus Environment, or backbone network, is characterized bystations distributed across multiple buildings; links of up to severalkilometers may be encountered.andP;  This application would typically be used fortrunk lines between Office/Building and/or Data Center Environments, and/orother lower-speed networks.andP;  This type of backbone application could also beextended to the factory floor.andM;FDDI Physical TopologyandM;FDDI is a ring network using an optical fiber medium.andP;  Like all rings, itconsists of a set of stations connected by point-to-point links to form aclosed loop.andP;  Each station receives signals on its input side and regeneratesthem for transmission on the output side.andP;  Any number of stations,theoretically, can be attached to the network, although default values in theFDDI standard assume no more than 1,000 physical attachments and a 200 kmfiber path.andM;FDDI can utilize two rings, called the Primary Ring and Secondary Ring (seeFigure 1).andP;  Data traffic usually travels on the Primary Ring.andP;  The SecondaryRing operates in the opposite direction and is available for reliability andfault-tolerance.andP;  These rings are discussed more below.andM;The standard defines two types of stations on the network; namely, dualattachment (Class A) and single attachment (Class B) stations (see Figure 1).andO;Dual attachment stations physically connect to both rings, while singleattachment stations connect only to the Primary Ring via a wiringconcentrator.andM;In the case of a link failure, a dual attachment station can reconfigure thenetwork using a combination of both the Primary and Secondary Rings.andP;  Thus, acable break between two dual attachment stations, as shown in Figure 2, wouldnot cause a degradation in service nor loss of a station from the network.andM;Single attachment stations attach only to the Primary Ring and cannot&quot;repair&quot; the network in case of failure.andP;  Thus, a link failure between asingle attachment station and wiring concentrator, as shown in Figure 3, willresult in the isolation of the single attachment station.andP;  The wiringconcentrator, itself a dual attachment station, will reconfigure itselfappropriately so that the other single attachment stations are not alsoknocked off the network.andM;A final comment on the dual ring nature of FDDI is necessary.andP;  FDDI limitsthe total fiber path to 200 km.andP;  Since the two rings may be configured insuch a way so as to effectively double the media length of the ring, it meansthat the geographic diameter of the network is really limited to 100 km.andM;One other point of interest with respect to FDDI is the data encoding scheme.andO;Since this is a fiber medium, an intensity modulation scheme might suggestitself -- i.e., a burst of light could represent a 1 while the absence orlight could represent a 0.andP;  The weakness of this scheme is that it isdifficult to provide clock synchronization in case many 1s or 0s are sentcontiguously.andM;Since FDDI is based upon LAN technologies, a Manchester-type encoding mightnext come to mind.andP;  In Manchester encoding, a 0-bit is represented by a highsignal for half a bit time, followed by a low signal for half a bit time; a1-bit is a low followed by a high.andP;  This signaling scheme has the nicecharacteristic that every bit signal also carries clocking information,namely, the mid-bit signal transition.andP;  The downside of Manchester encoding(and Differential Manchester, which is used in the IEEE 802.5 Token Ring) isthat every bit would require two signals -- a pulse of light and the absenceof light -- and have an efficiency of 50%.andP;  Thus, a 100M-bits-per-secondtransmission rate would require 200 million signals per second (200M baud).andM;The scheme that FDDI does use is called 4B/5B.andP;  In this scheme, a four-bitsequence of data is encoded into five bits for transmission.andP;  The five-bitcodes were chosen in such a way as to ensure no more than three bit timesbetween signal state transitions, thus making clock synchronization mucheasier.andP;  Since five signals are sent to transmit four bits, 4B/5B signalinghas an 80% efficiency and the 100M-bits-per-second rate requires 125M baud.andM;The use of the 4B/5B scheme also points to another FDDI optimization.andP;  TheMAC scheme is designed to operate on four-bit (nibble) and eight-bit (octet)quantities, rather than on single bits.andP;  Thus, processing hardware does nothave to operate at the network speed of 100M bits per second.andP;  The ability toprocess nibbles and octets reduces the necessary processing speed of FDDIchips and processors.andM;FDDI Medium AccessandM;ControlandM;The FDDI MAC scheme is loosely based upon IEEE 802.5 token passing.andP;  Whiletrying to adopt as much as the 802.5 standard as possible, the X3T9.5 TaskGroup made changes where necessary to take advantage of the high speeds offiber and to deliver the services expected of a MAN.andM;Figure 4 shows the MAC frame formats for an FDDI Frame and Token.andP;  A Framecarries MAC control data or user data, while a Token is used to transfercontrol of the medium to another station.andM;While the fields of the frame are described below, the main purpose of thisdiscussion is to show the similarities to the IEEE 802.5 standard.andP;  Per thecomments above about the 4B/5B coding scheme, it should be noted that theFDDI standard typically refers to &quot;symbols&quot; rather than &quot;bits.&quot;andP;  The readershould note that a symbol is equivalent to four bits.andM;The FDDI MAC frame fields are:andM;* Preamble (PA): Used to synchronize the frame with the station's clock.andP;  ThePreamble in the original frame is a 16-symbol (64-bit) sequence, butsubsequent stations may change the length according to their own clockingrequirements.andM;* Starting Delimiter (SD): A unique two-symbol (eight-bit) pattern indicatingthe start of the frame.andM;* Frame Control (FC): An eight-bit pattern defining the type of frame andassociated control functions.andP;  The format of this octet is CLFFZZZZ.andP;  TheC-bit (Frame Class) indicates whether this is synchronous or asynchronousservice.andP;  The L-bit (Frame Address Length) indicates whether this frame uses16-bit or 48-bit addresses.andP;  The FF-bits (Frame Format) indicates whetherthis frame is an LLC frame carrying user of a MAC control frame; in thelatter case, the ZZZZ-bits indicate the MAC control frame type.andM;* Destination Address (DA): Indicates the address(es) of the station(s)intended to receive this frame.andP;  The DA field may contain a single station'saddress, a multicast (group) address, or a broadcast address.andP;  This field maybe 16 or 48 bits in length.andP;  The FDDI standard uses the same 16-bit and48-bit address formats as the IEEE 802 standards; unlike the 802 standards,however, 16- and 48-bit addresses can both be used on the same network.andM;* Source Address (SA): Indicates the address of the transmitting station.andO;The length of this field must match the length of the DA field.andM;* Information (INFO): Contains MAC control information or user data.andP;  Thelength of this field is variable, but is limited by the maximum frame lengthof 4,500 octets.andM;* Frame Check Sequence (FCS): Carries the 32-bit cyclic redundancy check(CRC) value for bit error detection.andP;  The FCS covers the FC, DA, SA and INFOfields.andM;* Ending Delimiter (ED): A unique pattern indicating the end of a frame.andP;  TheED is two symbols (eight bits) for a Token and one symbol (four bits) for aFrame.andM;* Frame Status (FS): Consists of at least three symbols, containing the ErrorDetected (E), Address Recognized (A), and Frame Copied (C) Indicators.andP;  (TheE, A and C Indicators in FDDI serve the same purpose as in the 802.5 frame.)andO;The FS field may be an arbitrary length.andM;FDDI Token ManagementandM;There are two major differences between FDDI and the 802.5 standard withrespect to token handling.andP;  The first has to do with when a token is issued.andO;In both token ring and FDDI networks, a station may transmit only afterdetecting a token.andP;  The transmitted frame will circulate around the ring andwill be removed by the transmitting station.andP;  After transmitting, the stationwill issue a new token.andM;In an 802.5 Token Ring network, a station transmits a new token only afterrecognizing its own address in the Source Address field of its returningframe.andP;  In FDDI, a token is generated as soon as the station is finishedtransmitting its frame(s).andM;The second difference in token handling is more complex and goes to the veryheart of the difference in the way in which bandwidth is allocated on the tworings.andM;The 802.5 Token Ring allows for different classes of service by definingeight levels of priority and providing a token reservation mechanism.andP;  FDDIhas a harder problem to solve -- it must provide guaranteed bandwidth andfair access for synchronous service, as well as dynamically allocating extrabandwidth for asynchronous service.andM;The FDDI MAC uses a Timed-Token Protocol (TTP) to offer both synchronous andasynchronous service to all stations.andP;  The TTP guarantees a certain amount ofbandwidth to every station, much like token passing; this supportssynchronous applications.andP;  &quot;Extra&quot; bandwidth is allocated on an as-neededbasis to asynchronous applications.andM;The FDDI ring works very much like a token ring.andP;  Information is transmittedserially from one station to the next.andP;  Each station regenerates and repeatsthe bits.andP;  The station that has access to the medium places bits on the ringand the addressed destination station copies the bits as they pass.andP;  Thestation that transmits is responsible for removing the bits from the ring.andM;A station has the right to transmit when it detects a Token on the ring.andP;  Thestation may capture the Token by removing it from the ring, and then transmitone or more information frames.andP;  When it is done transmitting, it places anew Token on the ring, allowing other stations to access the medium.andP;  AToken-Holding Timer (THT) limits the length of time that a single station canmonopolize the ring before it has to send a new Token.andP;  It is this THT, andthe ability to send multiple frames while holding the token, thatdemonstrates one of the main differences between the TTP and 802.5 tokenpassing.andM;As briefly as possible, the FDDI TTP works as follows.andP;  Due to therequirements for synchronous service, a station knows when it must send aToken to the next station on the ring.andP;  When the station sees a Token, it maysend its synchronous service traffic.andP;  If the station is finishedtransmitting before it is required to send a Token to the next station, thisrepresents &quot;extra&quot; bandwidth; the station can use this time to sendasynchronous frames.andM;Let's go into a little more detail on this idea.andP;  When the ring isinitialized, all stations indicate the minimum amount of time that theyrequire for synchronous service.andP;  This bidding process is necessary so thatall stations can agree on a Target Token-Rotation Time (TTRT).andP;  The TTRT musttake into account several factors, including:andM;* The amount of time that each station requested the token for synchronousservice.andM;* The propagation delay associated with the length of the ring (DMax).andM;* The time required to transmit a Token (TokenTime).andM;* The time required to transmit a maximum length frame (FMax).andM;The sum of all of these factors yields a minimum TTRT, the value of which ismade known to all stations on the ring.andM;When a station receives a Token, it measures the amount of time since it lastreceived a Token.andP;  This value is accumulated in a Token Rotation Timer (TRT).andO;When the Token arrives, the TRT value is placed into a Token-Holding Timer(THT).andP;  Meanwhile, the TRT is reset to 0, where it starts again to count theamount of time between subsequent sightings of the Token.andM;While the station holds the token, it is the only station allowed to transmiton the network.andP;  It may now transmit synchronous frames for the amount oftime that it had requested for synchronous service.andP;  After transmitting thesynchronous frames (if there were any), the THT starts to run and the stationcan send asynchronous frames as long as THT [is less than] TTRT; i.e., it cansend asynchronous frames until it runs out of time and has to pass the tokenon to the next station.andM;In this way, every station has an opportunity to send synchronous andasynchronous traffic.andP;  Synchronous frames are provided with a guaranteedbandwidth, guaranteed response time and fair access; asynchronous frames aresent using any &quot;extra&quot; bandwidth.andP;  Synchronous bandwidth is expressed as apercentage of TTRT; i.e., a station would require a 100% allocation totransmit for a time equal to TTRT before issuing a Token.andM;Note that if all stations are using their maximum synchronous frame time, theamount of time left for asynchronous frames will decrease.andP;  Conversely, asstations have less synchronous traffic, the time for asynchronous trafficincreases.andP;  This is how bandwidth (i.e., time) is dynamically allocatedbetween the two types of services.andM;The MAC scheme for FDDI is very interesting, but also relatively complex.andO;The description above has only scratched the surface of its operation.andP;  Otherissues, such as the ring initialization procedure, timer calculations andoperation, priorities within the asynchronous service, and MAC controlframes, are beyond the scope of this article.andM;FDDI ConcludedandM;In keeping with the IEEE LAN architecture model, the FDDI MAC is fullycompatible with the IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) standard.andP;  Thismeans that applications that can currently interface to the LLC and operateover an 802.3 CSMA/CD or 802.5 token ring LAN should be able to operate overan FDDI network.andM;The FDDI specification comprises four ANSI standards (see Figure 5):andM;* The Physical Layer Medium Dependent (PMD) standard corresponds to the lowersublayer of the OSI Physical Layer.andP;  It includes specifications for powerlevels, characteristics of the optical transmitter and receiver, permissiblebit error rates, jitter requirement, etc.andP;  The PMD is contained in draftAmerican National Standard (ANS) X3.166, expected for adoption in 1989.andM;* The Physical Layer Protocol (PHY) corresponds to the upper sublayer of theOSI Physical Layer.andP;  It deals with such issues as the encoding scheme, clocksynchronization and data framing.andP;  The FDDI PHY is contained in ANSX3.148-1988.andM;* The Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol corresponds to the lower sublayerof the OSI Data Link Layer.andP;  (The LLC corresponds to the upper sublayer.)andO;The MAC standard defines rules for medium access, addressing, frame formats,error checking and token management.andP;  The FDDI MAC is contained in ANSX3.139-1987.andM;* The Station Management (SMT) standard specifies system managementapplications for each of the FDDI protocol layers.andP;  In particular, itconcerns itself with the control required for correct operation of a stationon an FDDI network.andP;  An SMT standard is expected in 1990.andM;The major FDDI vendor who is shipping products today is FibronicsInternational (Hyannis, MA).andP;  Its product line includes an Ethernet-to-FDDIbridge (FX8210), FDDI Network Management System (FX8510), and FDDI Extender(FX8400).andP;  These products are based upon the Advanced Micro Devices(Sunnyvale, CA) SuperNet chip set.andP;  Integrated Networks (IN-Net) in SanDiego, CA, also makes FDDI bridge products.andM;The IEEE 802.6 MANandM;StandardandM;For comparison purposes, it is worth mentioning the IEEE 802.6 MAN standard.andO;The 802.6 Working Group has been developing a MAN standard for several years.andO;Unlike FDDI, the 802.6 MAN is designed to operate over optical fiber orcoaxial cable.andM;Until late 1987, the IEEE 802.6 MAC scheme was called the Multiplexed Slottedand Token Ring (MST) and was very similar to the FDDI Timed-Token Protocol.andO;In November 1987, however, the IEEE 802.6 committee adopted the Queued Packetand Synchronous Switch (QPSX) approach, which they later renamed theDistributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB); this scheme utilizes a dual-bus topologyrather than a ring.andP;  An 802.6 MAN standard should be finalized this year.andO;QPSX Communications Pty.andP;  Ltd. (Australia) currently makes products thatutilize the DQDB scheme.andM;MANs And BroadbandandM;ISDNandM;MANs are sometimes referred to as early implementations of Broadband ISDN(BISDN).andP;  This may be a matter of interpretation, but most of the necessarycharacteristics are present -- digital signaling, high rates of speed(between the proposed ISDN H3 and H4 channel rates), and the integration ofvoice, video and data.andP;  The 64K-bits-per-second B channels can easily bemapped into the synchronous time slots, while D channel signaling and userdata can be carried during the asynchronous time periods (although there issome speed mismatch when going from a multi-mega-bits-per-second MAN to a16K-bits-per-second D channel).andP;  If incorporated correctly in the standardsprocess, MANs could well become integral to the deployment of BISDN.andM;REFERENCES ANDandM;FURTHER READINGandM;Kessler, G.C.andP;  Tokenism: An Introduction To The IEEE 802.5 Standard.andP;  LANMagazine Bookstore, September 1988.andM;Stallings, W.
