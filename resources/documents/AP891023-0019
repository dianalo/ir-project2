It has spawned what many anxious Pakistanis call a ``heroin andKalashnikov culture'' of crime, referring to the preferredautomatic weapon of the region's drug lords.   Most of the brightly colored poppies are grown in neighboringAfghanistan, where 11 years of civil war have precluded any attemptto control their cultivation.   Officials say the flowers' sticky yield of opium is refined intoheroin powder in makeshift laboratories along the ruggedPakistan-Afghan frontier. It is then spirited through Pakistan tomarkets in the United States and Europe.   Western narcotics agents estimate that up to 80 percent of theheroin sold in Europe and 25 percent sold in the United Statescomes from the so-called ``Golden Crescent'' region of SouthwestAsia.   The remainder comes from Mexico and Southeast Asia's ``GoldenTriangle,'' U.S. sources say.   Pakistani officials say it's hard to estimate how much of thedrug passes through their country. Khalim Dilkhan, chairman of thePakistan Narcotics Control Board, said that in 1988 alone localagents seized 13,670 pounds of heroin, compared with 950 poundsseized in 1980.   He said heroin addiction was virtually unknown in this Moslemcountry of 109 million people 10 years ago but now more than onemillion mostly poor, urban Pakistanis are hooked.   Their preferred method of using the drug is to smoke it, whereasmost addicts in the West inject heroin.   ``In 10 years, the problem has multiplied a thousand times,''Dilkhan said.   There are no statistics on addicts in Afghanistan.   Poppy cultivation has declined steadily in Pakistan, but it hasrisen sharply in Afghanistan, where fighting between the Marxistgovernment and Moslem rebels has turned tribal areas along themountainous Afghan-Pakistan frontier into a haven for drug lords,Dilkhan said.   He said opium production in Pakistan was about 140 tons in 1988,down from nearly 990 tons in 1980. In Afghanistan, this year'syield will be anywhere from 935 to 2,200 tons, Pakistani andWestern narcotics experts estimate.   Opium production, and to some extent export, have existed forcenturies in both countries but experts say three major events in1979 combined to help build the multimillion-dollar heroin industry:   _ The Turkish government's crackdown on heroin labs in easternAnatolia, forcing production into western Iran.   _ Iran's Islamic revolution, which ousted the Shah's governmentand purged corrupt officials who secretly participated in the opiumtrade.   _ The war in Afghanistan, which began after a Soviet-supportedcommunist coup in 1978 and has hindered efforts to control poppycultivation.   Opium production declined in the first years following the 1979Soviet military intervention but increased steadily in themid-1980s, experts say.   The United States, which together with Pakistan backsAfghanistan's anti-communist rebels, has only recently startedworking with guerrilla leaders to discourage poppy cultivation.   Washington is mounting a $10 million program that over the nextthree years hopes to promote drug awareness among Afghanistan'smujahedeen rebels and offer incentives to substitute the opiumpoppy with other crops, U.S. officials say.   American and Pakistani experts deny reports that the insurgentssystematically sell heroin to buy weapons.   ``There is no evidence of organized (heroin) activity but asindividuals, yes, some of them are doing it,'' Dilkhan said of theguerrillas.   Experts say that Pak-Afghan heroin follows three routes from thefrontier westward:   _ Across northern Pakistan, then south to Bombay for shippingthrough the Arabian Sea.   _ Due south through Pakistan's desert province of Baluchistan,often by camel or jeep caravan, to the Arabian Sea.   _ South to Baluchistan, then west through Iran and Turkey.   The new Pakistani government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,who took office after November elections, declared war on herointraffic. The government has received more than $60 million in U.S.aid for the effort.   Dilkhan says the government campaign focuses on poppy cropsubstitution, destruction of plantations through aerial spraying,interdiction of overland shipments and drug awareness among thepopulation.   Narcotics agents are reluctant to discuss official corruption,which many describe as a main obstacle to Pakistan's war on drugs.   ``Lets face it, we're talking about huge amounts of money. Thatattracts corruption,'' said a Pakistani narcotics official,speaking on condition of anonymity.   Dilkhan said police arrested a number of ``mid-level drugbarons'' this year but that it was difficult to collect enoughevidence to bring them to trial.   ``The money factor is tremendous. It's highly profitable,'' hesaid.   Agents say one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of 97 percent pure heroinfetches $1,000 at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.   ``Multiply that about 100 times for New York City,'' Dilkhansaid.   Crop substitution is unattractive to most poppy growers becausethey are accustomed to handsome profits, he says.</TEXT></DOC>
