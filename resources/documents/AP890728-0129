Martin had been scheduled to open a weeklong engagement atBally's on Thursday night. It was the first time a Strip headlinerhas been affected in the two-month dispute between hotels andmusicians. Picketing continued Friday.   The musicians set up picket lines after Bally's switched fromlive music to taped numbers for their production show, Jubilee,Thursday night.   Several Las Vegas hotels that feature lavish production showshave announced they are dropping live music for some productionnumbers. Name stars still use live musicians.   Bally's announced earlier this summer that it was cutting outlive music for the Jubilee show, but would continue using musiciansfor headliners such as Martin appearing in the hotel's Celebrityshowroom.   However, Celebrity room musicians joined the picket lines tosupport colleagues who lost their jobs in the Jubilee changeover.   Martin said he was upset by the strike.   ``For over 35 years I've played Las Vegas, always utilizing LasVegas musicians,'' Martin said in a statement Thursday. ``At notime has Bally's ever asked me to perform without live musicians.I'm saddened by the musicians' union strike which occurred today atBally's and by the effect it has had on many people. Any timepeople are out of work, it is personally upsetting.''   Cancellation of the show left 86 people out of work _ 23musicians who would have played for Martin and 63 other unionmembers who work in the Celebrity room as stagehands and foodservice employees.   The musicians previously struck the Tropicana Hotel when thatresort switched from live music to tape for its Folies Bergereshow. And the union set up informational pickets at the FlamingoHilton earlier this week when that resort switched from live musicto tape for its City Lites show.   The switch from live to taped music directly affected 45 unionmusicians _ 19 at Bally's and 13 each at the Tropicana and FlamingoHilton.</TEXT></DOC>
