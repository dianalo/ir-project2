The FDIC arranged the transfer of the failed bank's insured deposits because the agency didn't receive any bids for the institution's purchase. UnitedBank's five offices won't reopen.    UnitedBank had assets of $217.9 million and held $161.1 million in 13,400 deposit accounts, including about $3.1 million in 470 accounts that exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor. Holders of those accounts will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the liquidation of the failed bank's assets.    UnitedBank was the 69th bank to fail this year, the 23rd in Texas. </TEXT></DOC>
