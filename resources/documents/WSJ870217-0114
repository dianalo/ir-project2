FialkaStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP MDESTNUCLEAR POWER, FUEL (NUK)AEROSPACE (ARO) </IN><TEXT>   Norway is preparing to ask Israel to submit some of its nuclear materials to regular inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure that they aren't being used to make nuclear weapons.    Knut Frydenlund, Norway's foreign minister, announced that Norway will seek to transfer its inspection rights over 20 metric tons of heavy water that Norway sold Israel in 1959. The sale included a guarantee by Israel that the heavy water, which is an isotope, or chemical variant, of water, would be used only for peaceful purposes.    Mr. Frydenlund's comments came after questions were raised in the Norwegian Parliament about the case of Mordechai Vanunu, a 31-year-old former Israeli nuclear technician who said Israel was using heavy water to make plutonium, a key ingredient for nuclear weapons.    Norway has exercised its right to inspect the heavy water only once, in 1961, and Mr. Frydenlund said his country doesn't have the expertise or the equipment to carry out such tests in Israel.    He pointed out that under the terms of its 1959 agreement with Israel, which predated the inspection program of the IAEA, Norway reserved the right to consult with Israel over the eventual transfer of its inspection rights to the IAEA.    The IAEA, based in Vienna, has inspected heavy water that Israel obtained from the U.S. under a similar agreement. The U.S. heavy water, according to the agency, is stored at a research facility outside Tel Aviv.    Israel also operates a heavily guarded research facility at Dimona in the Negev desert where, according to Mr. Vanunu, it uses large amounts of heavy water in a nuclear reactor that produces plutonium. Mr. Vanunu disappeared for a time last year after turning over evidence about Dimona to the Sunday Times of London. In November, Israeli officials announced that he was being held in Israel under court order, pending trial on unspecified charges.    Norway's proposal to shift its inspection rights came after Gary Milhollin, a University of Wisconsin Law School professor and an expert on heavy-water shipments, asserted that Israel used the Norwegian heavy water to start its plutonium-producing reactor at Dimona.    Mr. Frydenlund said Norway has no specific information outside press accounts that Israel has nuclear weapons. Israel, which had no immediate comment on Mr. Frydenlund's remarks, has stated that it &quot;will not be the first nation to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
