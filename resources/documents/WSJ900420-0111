The private-placement market is a rapidly growingfinancing arena in which companies forgo many of theregistration requirements of public offerings and sell chunksof stock or debt directly to insurance companies and otherinstitutional investors. The market is estimated at $170billion, and about 35% of all corporate financings last yearwere private placements.</LP><TEXT>   But buyers of those private securities couldn't easilyresell them under earlier SEC rules, reducing the liquidityof the investments and in turn sending many U.S. companiesoverseas looking for investors. Moreover, foreign issuerscouldn't easily enter the U.S. market without disclosing morethan they were required to in their home countries.   The SEC yesterday moved to ease those requirements,unanimously passing Rule 144a, which commission officialssuggest could open the floodgates to companies seeking to usethe non-public markets. The rule &quot;will enhance thecompetitiveness and efficiency of our domestic markets,&quot; SECChairman Richard Breeden said. &quot;The result should be a lowercost of capital.&quot;   The rule would create a &quot;144a market&quot; that would in effectallow large players to trade among themselves without goingback to the registration and disclosure process. But it willbe closed to all but the biggest investors. Only institutionsthat own $100 million or more in securities, estimated to bethousands of investment houses and corporations, can buyprivate placements under the rule.   In addition, the commission tacked on two new wrinkles tothe proposed rule. Banks and thrifts are forced to leapanother hurdle to play in the market: They must have networth of at least $25 million. SEC member Mary Schapiro saidthat about 50 savings-and-loans that met the standard $100million threshold wouldn't qualify under the new guideline.   But the rules were relaxed for brokerage houses, whichwill be able to participate if they own $10 million insecurities.   To help investment in the products, the SEC is looseningthe rules governing mutual fund investments. Mutual fundsgenerally can't invest more than 10% of their assets inso-called restricted, or illiquid, securities such as privateplacements. But the SEC said it will allow the funds'directors to determine whether 144a investments are liquid.The agency said that more than 1,000 mutual funds will meetthe eligibility standards for the market.   In tandem with Rule 144a, the SEC also approvedestablishment of a trading system called Portal, which wascreated by the National Association of Securities Dealers.Portal will act as an electronic bulletin board to facilitatethe trading of large blocks of debt and stock in the 144amarket.   The electronic board also has the potential to be adaptedinto a trading and pricing system for bonds, Chairman Breedensaid. He asked agency staffers to push the NASD to considersuch a system, especially for the high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bondmarket, where price and trading information is oftendifficult to find.   Mr. Breeden also said at the meeting that the agency willbe examining shelf-registration rules to see what changes areneeded to foster capital creation by companies. Shelfregistrations allow companies to register once for a seriesof financings.   The first entrants into the 144a market are expected to beforeign companies looking to raise money in the U.S. Manyforeign issuers have shied away from the U.S. markets becauseof the tougher disclosure rules designed to protectindividual investors.   By allowing only &quot;sophisticated&quot; large institutions toplay in the market, the SEC felt it didn't need to offer muchprotection to the pension funds, mutual funds, insurers,charitable organizations and others that already have $100million in securities.   Stocks or bonds that are traded on any public exchangewon't be allowed in the 144a market, a restriction designedto keep private securities from spilling over into the publicmarkets and vice versa.   Under the new guidelines, U.S. or foreign companiesalready registered with the SEC for any kind of securitywon't have to disclose anything more. U.S. companies thathaven't registered will have to make financial informationavailable to holders on request.   Foreign companies that haven't made a U.S. public offeringin the past but have done so in their own countries need onlyprovide the same information that they would in their owncountries. If they haven't made an offering in the U.S. or athome, they will need to make information available accordingto the same rules as U.S. companies that haven't registeredin the U.S.   Not everybody is enthusiastic about the rule change. In asharply worded letter to Mr. Breeden, Reps. John Dingell (D.,Mich.) and Edward Markey (D., Mass.) questioned the legalityof the SEC to move in the area. &quot;We are concerned that Rule144a may be . . . beyond the scope of the powers of thecommission,&quot; they wrote.   Moreover, Rep. Dingell, the head of the House Energy andCommerce Committee, and Rep. Markey, who runs the panel'sfinance subcommittee, expressed concern about &quot;thedevelopment of a two-tiered market for U.S. investors, onepublic and one private.&quot;   The two lawmakers said they were concerned about &quot;thediminished availability of many quality investments tosmaller investors&quot; and that bad investments could be passedon to individual investors through mutual funds and pensionfunds.   And in an unusually prickly request, Reps. Dingell andMarkey asked the SEC to report to the committee every sixmonths on a 13-part set of questions about the 144a market.</TEXT></DOC>
