 The systems are called coprocessor boards,modular computers or scalar processors by different vendors; theyallow users to upgrade their systems quickly and inexpensivelywhile retaining their investment in peripherals.andP;  The CPU,coprocessor (or socket) and support chips are moved off themotherboard and onto a separate module; the 'dumber' motherboardholds system RAM, I/O slots and controller electronics only.andO;Despite the obvious advantages of such modular computers, theconcept plays on users' fear of technical obsolescence.andP;  Machinesusing plug-and-play motherboards will be more expensive thantraditional systems at first, but they may eventually be cheaper.andO;Still, upgrading a CPU is not a cure-all because peripherals canslow performance considerably.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     ModularityComputer DesignMicrocomputersUpgradingCPUUser NeedsTrendsIndustry AnalysisPerformance Improvement.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Looking for a computer that's guaranteed to expand as your needs grow?andO;Always want the latest in processing power?andP;  Does your heart lust for a 50MHz486 when your budget can only afford a 25MHz 386?andM;According to several vendors, the answer to your pleas (except for alow-budget 486) is the plug-and-play CPU.andP;  The design details vary, but thebasic concept repeats itself for several manufacturers, including ALR, Arche,Dell, Everex, Northgate, and Tandon.andP;  Call them coprocessor boards, modularcomputers, or scalar processors.andP;  Given the rapid change in CPUs, I callthese items either the right manufacturing concept or an elaborate electronicsecurity blanket.andM;The basic scheme has merit: Upgrading the horsepower of the system byexchanging or adding a single board.andP;  You keep the investment in the basiccomputer, such as the case, power supply, keyboard, video, and disk drives.andO;You usually keep your system RAM also.andP;  Just do a quick change on the CPUs toget more horsepower from the same box.andM;The raging fashion statement isn't a coprocessing board like IBM's drop-in486 power module.andP;  What's in vogue is dragging the CPU, coprocessor (orsocket), and support chips off the motherboard and onto a separate module.andO;The new, &quot;dumber&quot; motherboard holds just the system RAM, I/O slots, andcontroller electronics (like an IDE controller) for the computer.andM;The promise of these modular computers is simple: As you need more power, youcan just change your CPU module.andP;  Want more sparkle in that 16MHz 386SX youjust bought?andP;  Just unplug your old CPU card and trade it in for a 33MHz or40MHz 386.andP;  Maybe a 20MHz 486SX (which may outrun all three 386s) is yourstyle, or, for Indy-car horsepower, slap a 33MHz or 50MHz 486 module underthe hood.andM;The obvious cost benefits of this approach make it especially attractive tobudget-sensitive corporate buyers.andP;  When a user wants more MIPS, for example,it just becomes a matter of exchanging a smaller amount of money and a CPUmodule for a faster module.andP;  No longer must you buy more system RAM, videoboards, power supplies, and the like.andP;  As anyone who has worked in businesswill attest, winning approval for an upgrade which eats less than one-half toone-eighth the price of a new system is a lot easier than getting approval tobuy a new box.andM;Modular computers can also eliminate a common headache that often accompanycorporate buying decisions; if you're unsure about a user's needs, thenchoose the PC with a lower-powered CPU.andP;  Even if the horsepower isinadequate, the upgrade still costs less than the price of buying a newsystem.andP;  By standardizing on such computers, corporations can also distributethe hand-me-down CPU modules within their own doors.andM;Modular computers are also likely to find a place in the office-at-home orvery-small-office market, where there is little room for castaway PCs.andP;  Theget-what-you-need and trade-up-when-you-need promises made by these machinesmake modular systems an attractive purchase.andM;Worth the Time andandM;Trouble?andM;Nevertheless, I'm not completely sold on modular computers.andP;  For some reason,I haven't been tempted to drop a new engine into my family car to get betterperformance.andP;  When my car suffers coronary seizure, I'll be shopping for anew car rahter than an engine transplant.andP;  So why should swappable CPUs bemore attractive?andM;To be blunt, the swappable CPU plays off our blind fear oftechno-obsolescence: the dread of buying anything electronic, knowing thattechnology's onslaught quickly makes the system obsolete.andP;  These machinescater to our perception that some product introduction tomorrow will makeyour current computer unusable.andM;In fairness, you can swap CPU modules faster than Jiffy Lube changes engineoil, and you don't need a can of hand cleaner after finishing the job.andO;However, basic modular systems claim a $200 to $500 premium over regularsystems.andP;  So, if you never swap CPUs, you'll be caught holding the handcleaner long after the vendor has dug deep into your wallet.andM;In its first pass at these machines, each PC maker has used its own uniquedesign for the CPU module.andP;  The designs rekindle the same thrill,expensiveness, and inability to locate second-sourcing as purchasing anyproprietary equipment does.andP;  Given the limited market, third-partycompetition is currently a no-show, and may be too slow out of the gate.andO;When you finally want to upgrade, this lack of competition may leave you withno choice of suppliers--and such no-option situations can lead to federalanti-trust laws.andM;On the other hand, the direct competitors to modular systems, non-modularmotherboards, may keep the CPU upgrade prices in check.andP;  Remember, thevendors use the same motherboard and modules in the complete computer systemsthey sell.andP;  The manufacturers can't overprice the boards and staycompetitive.andM;Actually, the plug-and-plays eventually may be cheaper than traditionalmotherboards.andP;  The one basic motherboard fits the entire line, meaningproduction and handling costs on this piece can enjoy every economy ofmanufacturing scale.andP;  Once the lines get rolling, the reselling price shouldreflect the reduced manufacturing costs.andM;Regardless of price, beware the promised MIPS of March.andP;  Swapping up to amore powerful CPU is not the panacea for everyone's problems.andP;  Keyperipherals and the system bus of the motherboard stay the same.andM;Key peripherals can drain the lifeblood of high-performance from any system.andO;If you don't plan on changing peripherals later, be more critical about diskdrive and video performance now.andP;  You'd be making a sucker bet if you startwith low-performance peripherals now (particularly slow hard disk drives),but hope for hyper-performance later.andP;  If you can outperform your disk drive,video, or serial port now, you will positively underwhelm your CPU later.andM;The bus wars may come back with a vengeance.andP;  With the ISA (AT) bus spec'edat a meager 8MHz and pushed by some 12MHz, even a 25MHz 386 cools its heelsfrom excessive wait states.andP;  Watch the blazing speeds by which a 50MHz 486can do the same.andM;I'm also suspicious of anyone claiming these machines can use any CPU, from286 to 486 (or 586), at any speed, from 16MHz to 50MHz, in nothing flat.andP;  Theclaims are nothing, flat.andM;First, a 286 or 386SX uses a 16-bit memory bus.andP;  Upgrading to a 386 or 486 inthese confines is a waste.andP;  The higher processors use a 32-bit bus.andP;  If youwant a 32-bit processor later, you need to get a modular system with a 32-bitprocessor now.andM;Second, engineers cannot thumb their creative noses at the laws of physics.andO;At 40MHz, the processor runs with 25-nanosecond (ns) cycles.andP;  At 50MHz, thecycle time is 20ns.andP;  (Electricity travels about 19 feet in that time.)andP;  Forany semblance of performance at these rates, the static RAM used for the CPUcache and the system support chips must be one-third faster than their 33MHzcounterparts.andP;  These chips are expensive and few, and not on the motherboardsI've seen.andP;  You may use a 40MHz or 50MHz processor on these machines, butyou'll never get your money's worth in improved performance.andM;The one promise vendors can keep depends on Intel's ability to keep itspromise ont he &quot;couble-486,&quot; a 486 chip which internally runs twice as fastas the system clock.andP;  If your machine can use a 33MHz 486, you can use amodule with this 486 running 66MHz inside.andP;  The system performance won'tdouble, but you may get a 25-percent gain.andM;Modular CPU computers offer an eloquent engineering solution for manyPC-related problems afflicting corporations and small companies.andP;  If theprices match or fall under those of traditional systems, anyone should buy amodular CPU.andM;However, don't be seduced by the promise of an unlimited upgrade path.andP;  Ifyou plan on an hefty upgrade (40MHz or higher CPU), or future plans inlcudemore peripheral power, then look at the current crop and just say no.andM;Chris DeVoney is a writer and consultant in Washington state, and author ofseveral books, including &quot;DOS Tips, Tricks, and Traps.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
