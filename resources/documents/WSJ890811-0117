Most of the contracts are to supply gas to the U.S., where Canada has 7% of the overall market but a much larger share in California and New England.    The producers sell their gas through contracts with gas-marketing companies, which negotiate with U.S. and Canadian buyers. The producers are reacting to higher prices recently won by a small number of other producers who negotiate contracts on their own.    Producers don't usually publish the prices they get for their gas, but Calgary-based Renaissance Energy Ltd. says the average price of gas it sold in this year's first quarter was 18% higher than a year earlier. Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. and Poco Petroleum Ltd., also based in Calgary, said their average prices rose 11% and 12%, respectively.    &quot;It's a general, overall increase,&quot; said Lloyd Dunkley, vice president and chief financial officer of Poco. &quot;We should see prices move significantly higher in the next 12 months.&quot;    Richard Hillary, natural gas manager of the Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group, said the price producers receive could double in five years to reach three Canadian dollars ($2.56) or C$3.50 per thousand cubic feet.    Most gas-market participants agree that prices are headed upward, but opinion is divided on how large the increases will be and how long they will last.    Edward Sonday, vice president of gas supply for Brooklyn Union Gas Co., New York, said his company is paying more for gas than a year ago, and that he expects &quot;steadily higher prices.&quot;    However, the American Gas Association, an industry group, says higher prices may stimulate enough new supplies to put a lid on the increase. &quot;In a year or two we'll have gas coming in from every direction and lots of it, as well as a lot more LNG {liquified natural gas} being imported,&quot; said Richard Itteilag, the association's director of gas demand analysis. &quot;I don't think Canadians can just walk away and expect buyers to come back at a higher price all the time,&quot; he added.    Canadian producers voted last week in favor of supplying Brooklyn Union and 15 other northeastern utilities with up to 341 million cubic feet of gas daily for 15 years, beginning in 1991. But they rejected 10 other U.S. contracts involving 214.5 million cubic feet a day.    Since January, producers have rejected 14 contracts negotiated by Calgary-based Western Gas Marketing Ltd., a unit of TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. Western Gas went back to the buyers and hammered out better terms on three of the contracts. Two of the sweetened contracts were approved by producers; no decision has been announced on the third.    Prices in long-term contracts are linked to &quot;baskets&quot; of alternative fuels. In two recently rejected U.S. contracts, producers objected because coal was included among the alternative fuels, and they expect coal prices to decline.    &quot;You can't get a producer to okay a contract that has No. 2 fuel oil any more, it has to be No. 6,&quot; which is more expensive, said Lorne Larsen, president of ProGas Ltd., another Calgary-based gas marketer.    &quot;Some people have false expectations; they believe western Canada is floating on a sea of natural gas that we have to sell,&quot; said Clayton Woitas, president of Renaissance Energy. &quot;What we've seen is a lot more people willing to sit around our table and negotiate, and we're in a position where we don't have to sell that gas at just any price. It's a nice change.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
