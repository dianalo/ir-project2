RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court this weeks takes upCongress' attempt to protect the American flag from desecration.While the issue before the justices is the law's constitutionality,politics won't be far below the surface.   The high court will hear arguments Monday and is expected torule by the time its current term ends, probably in late June orearly July. If the law is struck down, a proposed constitutionalamendment to protect the flag almost certainly would become aleading issue in congressional and state legislative races thisfall.   The one-hour argument session is extraordinary. On only threeoccasions in recent times has the court heard arguments on a caseso late in a session.   The law, the Flag Protection Act of 1989, makes it a crime,punishable by up to a year in prison, for anyone who burns,mutilates, defaces or tramples on the flag or ``maintains (it) onthe floor or ground.''   The court will examine its past rulings on the First Amendmentsafeguards of free speech and expression.   While the Bush administration defends the law, it's no secretPresident Bush and leading Republicans would prefer aconstitutional amendment to ban flag burning _ something that wouldbe unnecessary if the justices uphold the law.   The prime sponsors of the law are Democrats, who learned abitter lesson from the 1988 presidential campaign in which Bushexploited patriotic values in defeating Gov. Michael Dukakis ofMassachusetts.   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, possibly a future Democraticpresidential contender, put the matter in perspective in a briefsubmitted to the high court.   If the law is struck down, the brief said, ``there will be aserious and profound impact on New York and other states becausesuch a ruling would almost certainly trigger a divisive battle inCongress and in the states over whether a constitutional amendmentto permit a ban on flag burning should be passed.''   The speaker of the House, Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., haspromised a House vote on a constitutional amendment within 30 daysif the court invalidates the law.   Such an amendment, proclaiming that a ban on flag burning doesnot violate free speech, would require approval by two-thirds ofthe members of the House and Senate and then ratification by 38state legislatures.   The First Amendment has not been modified since it took force199 years ago.   When lawyers for the administration and demonstrators who haveburned flags address the court Monday, they may target JusticeHarry A. Blackmun more than the other eight jurists.   Blackmun voted with the majority in June when the justices, by a5-4 margin, struck down a Texas law barring desecration ordestruction of the flag. The court said that burning the flag as aform of political protest is protected by the Constitution'sfree-speech guarantees.   But Blackmun, in a 1974 ruling, indicated he might go along withsome laws to protect the flag's ``physical integrity.''   In that case, Blackmun dissented as the court threw out theconviction of a Massachusetts man who wore a small flag on the seatof his pants.   The Flag Protection Act was a reaction to the court's Juneruling and the political firestorm that followed.   House Democratic leaders say the law differs from the Texasstatute because the federal act does not single out flag burning asa means of expression.   The Texas law specifically banned flag burning that seriouslyoffends others.   The federal law forbids defiling or destruction of the flag forany purpose _ except to destroy a soiled or tattered flag.   The Justice Department, in a written brief to the court, said,``It is the physical assault and accompanying violation of theflag's physical integrity _ not robust and uninhibited debate _that occasion the injury that our society should not be called uponto bear.''   Moreover, the department said, the court owes Congress specialdeference in this case because an equal branch of government hasdetermined flag burning can be outlawed without violating freedomof speech.   Lawyers for the demonstrators said their clients ``consider flagburning an essential element of their political expression because,for them, the flag represents not glory but oppression.''   They also said flag desecration has been an American tradition.``The United States flag was born of a desecration,'' the lawyerssaid. ``George Washington ... in 1776 ... defaced a British flag byordering sewn upon it 13 red and white stripes.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 13</NOTE></DOC>
