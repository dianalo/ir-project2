The decision by the jury in Bristol Superior Court inTaunton, Mass., reflects major changes in recent years inadoption disclosures. In the case, the state maintained thatin withholding information in 1974 that the adopted child wasretarded and that its biological mother was schizophrenic, itwas following standard procedure at that time.</LP><TEXT>   But the state conceded that today such information wouldhave to be disclosed. &quot;Now we encourage adoptive parents toask a lot of questions . . . about the medical andmental-health history of the child and the biologicalparents,&quot; said Lorraine Carli, a spokeswoman for theMassachusetts Department of Social Services.   The state is expected to appeal the jury verdict. The casewas the first of its kind in Massachusetts, although a secondone is scheduled to go to trial later this year. The statealso claims that under Massachusetts law, the state'sliability in the case should be limited to a maximum of$200,000.   The jury found that Massachusetts should have informedTheodore and Hazel Mohr, of Norton, Mass., about theretardation of the eight-year-old girl they adopted in 1976and about her biological mother's schizophrenia, which isbelieved to be hereditary. Instead, the Mohrs didn't learn oftheir daughter's medical history until 1984 when the recordswere discovered at the office of the child's pediatrician.   The Mohrs' attorney, Stephen Sheehan of the Providence,R.I., firm Wistow andamp; Barylick, said he believes thousands ofcouples may have been hurt by the state's policy of notdisclosing certain health information about adopted children.The state didn't formally change its policy on disclosureuntil 1990, although in recent years it had begun to providemore information to adoptive parents.   Mr. Sheehan said that while other states have facedsimilar suits, Massachusetts was slower than most in changingits policy on disclosure. He said that nationwide the push todisclose more information about adopted children's healthhistories began in the mid-1960s. Massachusetts &quot;was out ofstep with the national standard for disclosure for adoption,&quot;he said.   At the trial, the social worker who handled the Mohradoption said she was instructed by her supervisors not todisclose details of the child's medical history to thecouple. Mr. Sheehan said the Mohrs' daughter, now 23 yearsold, has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals since shewas 14. She currently lives at home with Mr. and Mrs. Mohr.   According to medical records, the daughter was diagnosedas retarded at four months old. Mr. Sheehan said the Mohrswere told only that she had been abused in a foster home andthat no medical records existed.   Owen Gallagher, an attorney for Massachusetts in the case,argued that the state handled the adoption appropriatelyunder its regulations at the time. Mr. Gallagher's firm,Gallagher andamp; Gallagher of Boston, is representing the stateunder a special pro bono program.   (Mohr vs. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Bristol, Mass.,Superior Court, 870152)   ---   SCIENTOLOGY SUIT against PaineWebber stock analyst orderedto go to trial.   The Church of Scientology alleged in the lawsuit filedlast year that it was libeled by PaineWebber Inc., one of itsstock analysts and Eli Lilly andamp; Co., manufacturers of theanti-depressant Prozac.   The Scientologists said the libel occurred when theanalyst, Ronald Nordmann, wrote a computer advisory for otherbrokers within PaineWebber and for customers saying that theScientologists were pursuing a &quot;vendetta to discreditProzac,&quot; that the drug was considered safe and thatPaineWebber was still recommending Lilly's stock.   Mr. Nordmann wrote his advisory one day after The WallStreet Journal published an article describing a lawsuit by awoman who claimed that Prozac made her try to commit suicide.The Scientologists had been active in raising questions aboutProzac and had helped publicize litigation against the widelyused drug.   Stock analysts are seldom sued for libel because they aregenerally exceedingly cautious about what they say in theirreports, says David E. Robbins, a securities industry lawyerat the New York firm of Kaufmann Gilden andamp; Carlin.   A U.S. magistrate recommended that the case be dismissed,but federal Judge Mary J. Lowe rejected that suggestion withregard to New York-based PaineWebber and Mr. Nordmann, sayingthat a jury ought to decide if Mr. Nordmann's advisory waslibelous. Judge Lowe upheld the decision to dismiss the caseagainst Indianapolis-based Lilly, saying there was noevidence that the drug company participated in the writing ofthe advisory.   In a prepared statement PaineWebber said, &quot;We aredisappointed in the judge's decision. We are confident thatwe will prevail on the merits.&quot; Michael O'Brien, director ofresearch at the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, whichwas established by the Scientologists, said, &quot;We're verypleased with the victory. It will give us the opportunity toget the truth about Prozac known to the investmentcommunity.&quot;   (Church of Scientology vs. Eli Lilly andamp; Co., PaineWebberInc., and Ronald Nordmann, U.S. District Court, Manhattan, 90Civ 7009.)   ---   PENSION SURPLUS awarded to plan participants in WisconsinPorcelain case.   A federal appeals court upheld a lower court rulingdenying Wisconsin Porcelain Partnership's bid to recapture apension plan surplus of roughly $5 million. The surplus fromthe pension plan that the St. Louis-based company hadterminated will go to the roughly 240 plan participantsinstead, the court ruled.   Federal pension law requires that, as long as a plan is ineffect, its funds must be used solely to benefitparticipating workers and retirees. However, the law alsolets companies terminate a plan any time as long as they meetexisting pension obligations.   In this case, the court ruled that the company had failedto comply with a clause in its pension plan that required allpartners to approve big changes, such as the one thatauthorized the company to keep excess pension money.   The plan participants will be awarded the money inproportion to their contributions, according to theemployees' lawyer, John Varda of Madison, Wis.
