Michael Dukakisaccused rival Richard Gephardt on Thursday of trying to impose ``a$50 billion burden on this nation's economy'' with an oil importfee.   Dukakis, barnstorming across Texas in quest of the 183Democratic delegates at stake in the biggest Super Tuesday primary,also said the Missouri congressman's trade legislation would ignitea global trade war like the one that ushered in the GreatDepression.   Meanwhile, the Dukakis campaign rolled out an anti-Gephardttelevision ad. As the screen is filled with the names of banks,defense contractors, utilities and other big businesses whosepolitical action committees have contributed to Gephardt, anarrator asks, ``Is Dick Gephardt really fighting your fight ... ortheirs?''   To revive the ailing U.S. oil industry _ a major issue in Texas_ Dukakis said he favors targeted incentives to encourage small,independent producers to ``do their drilling and get that rig countup.'' In addition, he called for repealing the oil windfall profitstax, filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and boosting naturalgas production.   Gephardt supports a fee on oil imports. However, Dukakis said,``An oil import fee will put a $50 billion burden on this nation'seconomy. We don't need that.''   Dukakis took another dig at Gephardt in a speech at theHarlingen airport. Recalling an exchange Monday in a Williamsburg,Va., debate when Gephardt asked if Dukakis is running ``forpresident of Mexico or president of the United States,'' thegovernor said to cheers, ``I said, Dick, if I'm president of theUnited States, I'm going to pay attention to our relationship withMexico, and I'm going to make sure that my proposals do not wreckthe economy of Mexico.''   A mariachi band greeted Dukakis in Harlingen and he repeatedmore than five minutes of his speech in Spanish for the largelyHispanic crowd. He promised that in January 1989, ``we're going tostop the shooting war in Nicaragua and begin to go to work with ourneighbors in Mexico ... as partners to create opportunity on bothsides of the border.''   Dukakis, on a visit to a successful small manufacturer of rubberparts for oil drills in the East Texas town of Tyler, also took ashot at Gephardt's trade policies, which call for retaliation inresponse to foreign nations' trade practices that are judged unfair.   ``We can never agree to go back to policies that almostdestroyed us 50 years ago. There's always somebody who suggeststhat: throw up the walls, hunker down,'' Dukakis said.   Invoking a baseball metaphor, he recalled the toweringleft-field wall at Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, andsaid, ``You can build that wall as high as you possibly can, andJim Rice can still hit it out.''   Later, in Corpus Christi, he said, ``Trade wars are like nuclearwars. They have no victors, only victims.''   Glenn Hilbun, 31, a supervisor at the rubber parts plant, said,``Down here, a lot of people are not really familiar with whatDukakis stands for. Face it, Texas is a Bush state'' _ a referenceto the Republican vice president.   Polls in Texas show a tight Democratic field and many undecidedvoters.   Dukakis, considered strong in Hispanic South Texas, was tryingto rally that support with stops here and at Harlingen and Laredoon the border before heading on to Houston and Lubbock. He headswest Friday to Denver, Cheyenne and Seattle, but was due back inSan Antonio Saturday night.   Speaking to 350 supporters on a stage set under palm treesbefore Corpus Christi bay, he said the 1981 Reagan tax cuts,supported by Gephardt, are ``the primary cause of a trade deficitthat has cost 2 million American jobs. We can't lead the world ifwe're in debt to it.''   Dukakis said 1.25 million Southern workers ``depend on exportsfor their jobs. These workers need a president who will use hisauthority to insist on fair treatment for American goods andservices overseas. As president I will use that authority.''   Even at MP Industries, the thriving Tyler business that got offthe ground 11 years ago with help from a Small BusinessAdministration loan, Dukakis found firsthand evidence of U.S. tradeproblems.   A gleaming, green computerized $100,000 lathe bore themanfacturer's name on its side in bold letters: Hitachi-Seiki.Another key piece of equipment came from Italy.   ``This is the story everywhere,'' said Dukakis. ``We're buyingstreetcars in Japan.''</TEXT></DOC>
