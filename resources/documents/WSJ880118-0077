Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> DES MOINES, Iowa  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gary Hart took the stage for the first time since he re-entered the race for the Democratic presidential nomination last month -- and made his six opponents look good.    In his first debate appearance with his rivals -- sometimes disparagingly referred to as the &quot;six dwarfs&quot; -- Mr. Hart seemed subdued and out of touch. Once the front-runner in the race, until he was forced out by revelations of marital infidelity, he failed to command the stage at the Des Moines Civic Center.    &quot;Hart succeeded in raising the stature of the six other candidates,&quot; noted Alan Baron, a political analyst.    Mr. Hart, interviewed at the airport here Saturday, implied that the debate format wasn't ideal. &quot;There will be other debates and forums,&quot; he said, &quot;when we can get into more substantive issues.    &quot;It was just nice being back,&quot; he said.    Mr. Hart argues that he re-entered the race because he believes in &quot;new approaches&quot; and &quot;new directions.&quot; In Ottawa, Kan., his boyhood home, he outlined Saturday a deficit-reduction package that would sharply increase taxes on Social Security benefits received by well-to-do individuals and couples.    A similar plan already has been proposed by former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt.    The other candidates -- Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Mr. Babbitt -- went about their business at Friday's debate almost as if Mr. Hart, the former Colorado senator, wasn't there.    It was left to moderator James P. Gannon, editor of the Des Moines Register, which sponsored the debate, to bring up Mr. Hart's infidelity. Mr. Gannon reminded Mr. Hart he had told editors of the Register that if he is elected, he wouldn't be &quot;the first adulterer in the White House.&quot; Mr. Gannon asked: Should voters in Iowa ignore these questions of character and judgment?    &quot;We have never expected perfection from our leaders,&quot; Mr. Hart replied. &quot;There is a difference between private morality and public morality. I've held myself to a very high standard in terms of both,&quot; he said, though he added that he should also have told the Register editors he is a &quot;sinner.&quot; Some of the nation's best leaders, he said, &quot;haven't led perfect private lives.&quot;    The other candidates quietly scored points of their own:   --Mr. Gephardt attacked The Wall Street Journal for reporting on Jan. 5 that, in the candidate's paraphrase, &quot;the farm crisis is over.&quot; He emphasized his populist themes of new agricultural policies and protectionist measures.    --Both Mr. Babbitt and Gov. Dukakis drew cheers with their responses to the guest questioner, Republican Gov. James Thompson of Illinois, when he implied criticism of their stands as governors against sending their National Guard units to Central America. &quot;There's a better way in Central America,&quot; Mr. Babbitt said, &quot;and it consists of terminating Contra aid.&quot;    --Sen. Gore and Mr. Jackson indulged in a little battle of their own. They are expected to meet down the road, on March 8, Super Tuesday, on their common Southern turf.    --Sen. Simon tried to picture himself as the new Hubert Humphrey, but he was thrown off stride trying to explain why he takes campaign money from political-action committees.    Iowans will caucus Feb. 8, in the first big political event of 1988, to choose delegates to both national conventions. On the Democratic side, the race is wide open. Mr. Hart runs well in the polls, but his organization is weak and he's expected to finish down in the pack. Of the others, Sen. Simon generally is seen as a front-runner, but beginning to struggle, followed by Gov. Dukakis and Mr. Gephardt.    Generally, though, the Democrats' debate was a sedate affair -- unlike the Republican candidates' livelier meeting Saturday afternoon at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. In that confrontation, Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, who was subdued in earlier debates, took a leading role and defended himself against charges he was a big taxer and, in terms of farm programs, a big spender. He accused his chief rival, Vice President George Bush, of inflating his role in pushing through the Social Security overhaul of 1983. The vice president didn't attend &quot;a single meeting,&quot; said the reinvigorated Mr. Dole.    Separately, Sen. Dole released his federal tax returns going back to 1966, showing that he and his wife, Elizabeth, paid taxes in 1986 of $133,856 on income of $508,078. He disclosed that Mrs. Dole cleared a $63,846 profit in 1986 selling a half-interest in a Kansas office building to a black businessman whom Sen. Dole had helped for more than a year in seeking government contracts.    The Doles said they hadn't known about the gain because it was in a blind trust, dissolved over the weekend, that was set up by Mrs. Dole in 1985 when she was secretary of transportation. Sen. Dole said the assistance to the businessman was what &quot;we would do for any constituent.&quot; He said the $30 million Army contract the businessman secured came &quot;through his own efforts.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
