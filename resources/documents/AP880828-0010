Two weeks after the tribes of Hutu and Tutsi renewed acenturies-old blood feud, killing thousands and sending tens ofthousands fleeing, sporadic killings continue and scores ofdeserted homes stand like grave-markers.   The Tutsi-dominated army, sent in to restore peace, is occupyingan area that is nearly 90 percent Hutu, the majority tribe in thistiny East African nation.   Soldiers with bayonets mounted on their rifles patrol the bushor man roadblocks. Others are camped beneath trees and behind coverthat also conceals armored personnel carriers.   Some string barbed and razor wire, while a group of 100 soldiersclamber around a crate-laden truck to get rations of the local beer.   An uneasy peace has been restored here, but with brutal force.   ``When the army came it couldn't distinguish between the Tutsiand the Hutu,'' said Stanislaus Baratakara, a Tutsi and one of thefew people who has found the courage to return home. ``To restoreorder, the army killed whoever was in the place.''   Baratakara, 52, an illiterate peasant farmer, lost two sons inthe violence. He had no notion how many other friends and neighborswere killed by the army or in the tribal warfare that preceded thearmy's arrival.   But standing Saturday outside a fire-gutted house, where he saida family of Tutsi had been murdered by Hutu, he said the killingshad not stopped.   ``There are some people hiding who come at night to somefamilies and take one or two people,'' he said.   A Hutu suspected of having participated in a massacre of Tutsiwas killed Saturday hours before a group of journalists reached hiscommune, Baratakara said. He said he did not know the killers butsuspected they were Tutsi.   The government has confirmed at least 5,000 deaths, a countbased on reports from gravediggers who dumped victims into massgraves at undisclosed sites.   But some Burundians, mostly Hutu among the 40,000 who fled intoneighboring Rwanda to escape what they say were reprisal killingsby the army, insist that they left behind tens of thousands of dead.   Hutu refugees in Rwanda, many of them with bullet or knifewounds, have told of soldiers herding people into houses and thenshooting them or using helicopters to firebomb villagers runningtoward Rwanda.   At the regional hospital in Kirundo, the provincial capital,about 40 to 60 patients, most of them Tutsi, tell similar tales ofHutu vengeance.   The Tutsi say Hutu neighbors who opposed the killings or refusedto participate were turned on by fellow Hutu.   Army medics and civilian nurses are treating the wounded, mostlywomen and children. Normally there are three doctors at thehospital, the only one serving the 371,000 people of this northernprovince, 125 miles from the capital, Bujubura.   The physicians, all Hutu, fled when the fighting began, saidnurse Francoise Nihorimbere.   The Hutu account for 84 percent of Burundi's 5 million people,but the Tutsi, about 15 percent, control the military and thegovernment.   Ethnic problems in the region date from the 15th century whenthe Tutsi _ a tall, Nilotic people _ migrated south from Ethiopiaand imposed feudal rule on the short, stocky Hutu.   Burundi is one of the world's most densely populated countries,and competition for space in the Maryland-sized nation is the causeof much of the ethnic animosity.   Why the latest bloodshed began is not known, although rumors andspeculation abound. Hutu refugees in Rwanda tell of arrests of Hutuor speak of unannounced army maneuvers that prompted fears of animpending Tutsi-led massacre. The government blames exiled Hutu forthe trouble.   In the past, it has taken little to set off killings here. In1972, Hutu using spears and knives killed hundreds of Tutsi in anattempt to overthrow the government.   The coup attempt was crushed and the Tutsi retaliated by killing100,000 to 300,000 Hutu, including most of the tribe'sintelligentsia.   But Burundians have lived in relative peace since Maj. Gen.Pierre Byoya deposed fellow Tutsi Jean-Baptiste Bagaza in abloodless coup in December 1987.   The new wave of killings caught the government and the Tutsipopulation off-guard.   ``On Sunday (Aug. 14), there was a meeting of those Hutu whowanted to attack Tutsi families,'' Baratakara said. ``When theystarted the massacre they burned each house of the Tutsi. They hadlong knives, machetes and spears.''   Baratakara said the attackers were his Hutu neighbors and he sawno outsiders.   He, his wife and four of their six children ran into the safetyof the bush after they saw two of Baratakara's sons, ages 18 and30, hacked down.   ``They were killed and their bodies eaten by dogs,'' Baratakarasaid.   About the same time as the trouble started in Ngeta, killingstarted in Marangara, 15 miles to the south in neighboring Ngoziprovince.   Although violence broke out in several other communes, the signsof carnage are most visible here in Ngeta.   Rows of houses _ built with a thick, brown mud from thehillsides _ have been gutted by fire. Windows have been smashed anddoors broken in.   Clay cooking pots are overturned or broken in the yards outsidethe houses.   Cattle graze unattended while thin dogs scavenge for food.   At a simple three-room house of one unidentified family, thecool, hard-packed mud floor is littered with debris. Seeds arescattered throughout the house.   In one bedroom, a bed has been overturned and straw sleepingmats trampled into bits. In another, the floor is littered withschool notebooks, childrens' clothes, a sickle-type knife and glassfrom broken window panes.   A huge cooking pot lies near the door as if it had been used ina vain attempt to bar entry.   Baratakara said the family living there was killed.   Baratakara, his wife and their two youngest children returned totheir ransacked home when the army arrived, about 24 hours afterthe killings started.   The other two surviving children are among 3,500 mostly Tutsi``refugees'' who have congregated in the commercial center of thecommune, afraid to return to their homes despite regular armypatrols.   Hundreds of Hutu in the area are unaccounted for. Many arefeared dead, though some may be among the 40,000 refugees in Rwanda.   Rwanda has enough trouble finding room for its 6.1 millionpeople, and the refugees present a major problem.   ``We are trying to help them,'' Frederick Karangwa, governor ofthe Rwandan province where the refugees have gathered, said lastweek. ``But they are overwhelming us.''</TEXT></DOC>
