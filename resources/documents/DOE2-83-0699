In present experiments the transitions from S to B regimeswere obtained by method of gas puff cutoff. Detail investigations ofprofile evolutions of T/sub e/(r), T/sub i/(r), n/sub e/(r) and carbondensity n/sub C/ showed, that n/sub e/ profile greatly charges aftergas puff cutoff, while T/sub e/(r) and T/sub i/(r) remain practicallyunchanged at the central zone of plasma. It pointed out to the possibilityof a relation between n/sub e/(r) and either T/sub e/(r) or T/sub i/(r).It is shown, that the main cause which is responsible for this transitionbetween B and S regimes, is variations of neutral atom influx to theplasma. The transition itself takes place at a given radius of plasma,when n/sub c/ reaches some limiting value at this radius. 11 refs.; 5figs.</TEXT></DOC>
