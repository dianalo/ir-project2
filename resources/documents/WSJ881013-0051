Molokai Ranch, based in Honolulu, owns about 33% of the Hawaiian island of Molokai, and participates in land development and construction there and on the mainland.    With 875,767 shares outstanding as of Aug. 11, the new bid values Molokai at about $48.2 million.    Molokai, which reacted coolly to the $45-a-share tender offer last month, yesterday said a committee of directors will unanimously recommend that shareholders accept the sweetened offer. Members of the committee said they will tender their shares, amounting to 15.6% of the outstanding shares.    Industrial Equity, the U.S. investment arm of New Zealand financier Sir Ronald Brierley, currently owns about 31% of Molokai's shares. Another 19% is held by D.S. Kennedy andamp; Co., a San Francisco brokerage house that participated in the original tender offer. </TEXT></DOC>
