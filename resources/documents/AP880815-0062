The government, which claims many refugees living in Hondurasback leftist Salvadoran guerrillas, had accused the church workersof exploiting the returning refugees for political ends.   The refugees and more than 150 vehicles, held on the Honduranside of the border since Saturday night, were allowed to cross theborder Sunday evening, said Roberto Rodriquez of the U.N. HighCommissioner for Refugees.   The church workers ``were conscious that by not coming theywould create no type of problems'' for the returning Salvadorans,he said by telephone.   Rodriguez said the refugees from El Salvador's nearly 9-year-oldcivil war were on their way to hometowns in northern Chalatenangoprovince, which they left in the early 1980s.   In the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, a foreign ministryspokesman said the refugees were being escorted by officials fromthe U.N. agency.   There was no immediate comment from the government and thechurch workers could not be reached.   The Salvadorans lived in the Mesa Grande refugee camp 30 milesnorth of the border before leaving under an arrangement between therefugees, the Salvadoran government and the U.N. group, which isoverseeing the repatriation.   Their convoy of 36 buses and 116 trucks was halted in Hondurasabout 500 yards from the border late Saturday. Salvadoranauthorities refused to permit 15 U.S. church workers of the GoingHome organization to accompany them.   Interior Minister Edgar Belloso Funes told reporters at theborder Sunday his government ``welcomes with open arms'' therefugees.   ``But the so-called internationalists among them are using ourbrothers for strictly political ends. They (the foreigners) arecoming here to break our laws, and I have orders from the highestlevel that they not be permitted entry,'' he said.   Amadeo Lopez, a returning refugee and member of the community'sdirectorate, said earlier Sunday that the group of 1,230 refugeeswas insisting the U.S. church workers be allowed to enter.   Jose Maria Mendiluce, the U.N. group's Central Americandirector, said the presence of the church workers was notcontemplated in the accord.   Louis Vitale, a Roman Catholic priest from Oakland, Calif., andspokesman for the Going Home delegation, blamed the government forthe standoff.   ``This is part of the Salvadoran government's continuing effortsto obstruct the refugees' return,'' he said, adding that allmembers of his delegation had visas for El Salvador.   Going Home is an interfaith organization supporting Salvadoranrefugees.   The armed forces consider the three Salvadoran refugee camps inHonduras part of the rear guard of leftist guerrillas that havefought the U.S.-supported government. About 4,300 refugees returnedlast year and about 15,000 Salvadoran refugees remain in the camps.   The majority of the 65,000 people killed in the war have beencivilians.   Human rights groups blame security forces and rightist deathsquads for most of the political murders in the early 1980s. Suchkillings dropped off dramatically after 1983.</TEXT></DOC>
