 Therefore,there's a long list of WYSIWYG Windows applications that demand screen fontsthat precisely match the 300-dot-per-inch (dpi) and higher resolutions ofink-jet, laser and typesetting printers.andM;ATM, FaceLift and Publisher's PowerPak smooth out Windows' stair-step screenfonts by generating both screen and printer fonts from the same vector-basedtypeface outlines.andP;  Each generates VGA screen fonts that are clear enough toallow on-screen manipulation of kerning pairs, tracking and other precisiontypesetting functions.andM;Aside from WYSIWYG Windows screen fonts, all three products bring theirvendors' proprietary typefaces to previously unsupported printers, includingHewlett-Packard LaserJets and DeskJets, dot-matrix and Post-Script-basedprinters.andP;  Fonts must be designed for each vendor's format, and the vendor'sown format fonts must be used with any of the three packages to get trueWYSIWYG.andM;Through the Windows 3.0 environment, these fonts are available to moreapplications than ever.andP;  However, despite the shared environment, theimplementation and flexibility of all three packages differs greatly.andM;Most PC users associate the &quot;font wars&quot; with Adobe's PostScript Type 1 formatvs.andP;  True-Type, the as-yet-unavailable Apple/Microsoft creation.andP;  However,this proprietary battle realistically includes typeface formats such asBitstream's new Speedo, Atech's PowerPak, Digital Typeface Corp.'s Nimbus Qand Agfa Compugraphic's Intellifont.andM;With FaceLift ($99 for new users or $69 as an upgrade from Fontware 2.X and3.0), Bitstream is asking current Fontware users to upgrade their typefacelibraries to the Speedo format.andM;The 52 Speedo-format typeface packages cost $129 each and typically containone typeface family (regular, bold, italic or bold italic).andP;  Until recently,the same Fontware typeface-outline packages cost $199.andM;FaceLift comes with 13 Speedo and Type 1 PostScript typeface outlines;however, Bitstream will upgrade any previously purchased Fontware outlines tothe Speedo format for $29.95 for the first package and $14.95 thereafter;it's free if the outlines were purchased after June 1.andM;While ATM and Publisher's PowerPak are in-house creations, FaceLift resultsfrom work done primarily by a West German firm, GCA, which specializes inWindows programming.andM;GCA has set up FaceLift as screen and printer driver &quot;shells,&quot; or dynamiclink libraries (DLLs), that sit between the Windows Graphics Device Interface(GDI) and the user's chosen screen and printer drivers.andM;Unlike ATM and Publisher's PowerPak, FaceLift can be activated anddeactivated for particular printer drivers on the fly.andM;Like ATM, but unlike Publisher's PowerPak, FaceLift supports all Windows 3.0printer-driver features.andP;  These include installed soft fonts, fonts residentin the printer or cartridge fonts.andM;The package also includes dialogue-box soft-font generation (from one to 30points) and installation.andP;  This allows the user to download commonly usedbody-text fonts once daily to avoid successive scaling of these fonts foreach document.andM;FaceLift also saves all generated screen and printer fonts in a cache.andO;Cached fonts are written on-screen or sent to the printer almostinstantaneously.andM;Bitstream is providing several promotional packages of Speedo typefaceoutlines for FaceLift.andP;  The Companion Value Pack ($199) adds 24 typefaces andeight display faces.andM;The PostScript Companion Pack ($179) adds the 35 default typeface outlinesfound in PostScript printers to the 13 base typeface outlines.andM;The Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III Companion Pack provides typeface outlinesfor the screen that are compatible with the CG Times and Univers typefaceoutlines, and Courier soft fonts that are resident in the printer.andM;ATM ($99) was first released for the Apple Macintosh in October 1989.andP;  Thelong-awaited PC version, ATM for Windows, brings Type 1 typefaces from Adobe,Linotype, Monotype, Agfa Compugraphic, Varityper, Letraset, Morisawa and ITCto the WYSIWYG Windows 3.0 screen and all of its supported printers.andM;While Bitstream is the only vendor of Speedo typefaces and Atech is the onlyvendor of PowerPak-format typefaces, Adobe has been licensing the Type 1format since its introduction, in 1985.andP;  And, in response to Apple's andMicrosoft's announcement at the Seybold Conference in September 1989 of thedevelopment of the competing TrueType (then called Royal) format, Adobereleased its Type 1 specification at the conference last March.andM;All of these events have given Adobe and other Type 1 suppliers the impetusto increase their libraries.andP;  However, while neither a TrueImage operatingsystem nor printer yet exists, PostScript Type 1 fonts and the PostScriptpage-description language are supported on more PC, network, minicomputer andmainframe platforms than any other format.andM;PC Week Labs had no problem using ATM to generate screen and printer fontsusing Type 1 typefaces from Adobe, Monotype, Linotype and Agfa Compugraphic.andO;In fact, Adobe claims that all Type 1 fonts that are supplied with *.PFB and*.PFM files, whatever their source, are supported.andP;  The Labs did find,however, that ATM did not recognize these files unless their names were eightcharacters long, a problem that is remedied by renaming the file andappending the necessary number of underscores to fill eight character places.andM;The screen and printer font cache in ATM is not as flexible as FaceLift's.andO;ATM allows the user to set the cache size, but the cache cannot be saved todisk.andP;  It does retain the most-often-used screen and printer fonts, however,ensuring that body-text fonts will be available to the user most of the time.andM;Like FaceLift, ATM intercepts relevant font calls by sitting between theWindows screen and the printer drivers.andP;  Resident printer fonts, soft fontsand cartridge fonts are used when called for in a document sent to theprinter.andP;  Printer fonts are scaled from PostScript typeface outlines onlywhen necessary.andP;  However, unlike FaceLift, ATM does not provide a soft-fontscaler.andP;  This product, called Font Foundry, is included with Adobe's TypefacePacks, but it runs from the DOS prompt, not inside Windows.andM;Font Foundry also will install soft fonts in non-windows DOS applications foruse with LaserJet printers.andP;  The Adobe Plus Pack ($198) adds the necessary 22typefaces to give ATM the same 35 default typeface outlines found inPostScript printers.andP;  The Adobe TypeSet 1 and 2 ($99) each provide sevendisplay typefaces from the 600-plus Adobe typefaces.andM;ATM and FaceLift are not the first to deliver on-the-fly Windows 3.0 screenand printer fonts.andP;  That honor goes to Atech's Publisher's PowerPak.andP;  (See PCWeek, Aug. 27, Page 33.)andM;This package generates on-the-fly printer and screen fonts, and itsmanagement of printer memory squeezes every last bit of text output speedfrom the printer.andM;Atech began delivering the $79.95 Publisher's PowerPak in July.andP;  The packagecomes with three typefaces that correspond to Courier, Times Roman andHelvetica.andP;  Each typeface is represented by the full family of type styles.andM;Publisher's PowerPak optimizes text throughput during printing by generatingand downloading only the smaller text fonts used in a document.andP;  Charactersfrom fonts larger than 30 points are sent to the printer as graphics, whilesmaller sizes remain cached in the printer's memory.andM;PC Week Labs found that his package offers fast text output with littleobservable effect on graphics output, compared with the standard Windows 3.0LaserJet printer-command-language driver.andP;  Publisher's PowerPak has noprovision for accessing font cartridges or resident printer fonts.andM;Atech offers 26 add-on font packs for $29.95 each and nine foreign-languageadd-on packs (including Korean, Cyrillic, Hebrew and Thai) for $79.95 each.andO;Also available for the same price are 25 licensed and well-executed Monotypefont packs that include Gill Sans, Times New Roman and Goudy Old Style.andM;In almost every performance category, FaceLift comes out ahead of ATM andPublisher's PowerPak.andM;All three applications display screen fonts and scaled printer fonts withacceptable speed.andP;  Tests performed by PC Week Labs using a 20MHZ 386 IBM PS/2Model 80-111 with 12M bytes of RAM, a 330M-byte Lightning Small ComputerSystem Interface drive and the default 96K-byte cache displayed most screenfonts within 10 seconds the first time and instantaneously thereafter.andO;Printer fonts were scaled with similar expedience.andM;Although its screen and printer drivers perform with similar speed,FaceLift's more powerful caching features can reduce this wait even further.andO;Publisher's PowerPak provides a powerful caching algorithm, but the cachesize can't be set by the user.andP;  Further, Publisher's PowerPak does not allowaccess to fonts resident in the printer, font cartridges or pregenerated softfonts.andM;FaceLift's Speedo outlines boast small size and quick font scaling.andP;  However,if Bitstream's Type 1 PostScript printer fonts are used with FaceLift,matching Speedo outlines will be needed as a model for screen fonts.andM;Both ATM and FaceLift require about 0.5M bytes of disk space for the base 13Type 1 typeface outlines.andP;  However, FaceLift requires an additional 0.85Mbytes for the matching Speedo outlines.andM;The documentation and on-line help facility provided with FaceLift is farsuperior to the other two packages.andP;  FaceLift also provides saturationcontrol of dot-matrix and ink-jet printer output.andP;  This gives the userspecial options over the speed, accuracy and quality of proofs.andM;All three packages allow the user to rename typefaces.andP;  All three productsare bound to cause infrequent line-ending mismatches between what's seen onthe screen and the printer output.andP;  This is due to rounding errors in theplacement of screen-font pixels.andP;  It only takes one line-ending mismatch toruin the alignment of images and text throughout a document.andM;These kinds of mismatches shouldn't happen very often, however, sinceFaceLift is using compatible Speedo outlines for Type 1 screen fonts.andP;  Themismatches with PostScript printer output may be more frequent.andM;Perhaps the greatest difference between these three products is printersupport.andP;  Publisher's PowerPak provides a universal printer driver.andP;  Thismeans that users of all printers are dependent upon Atech to support everyeventuality surrounding their printer, including new or upgraded printerspurchased in the future.andM;When active, ATM automatically supports all installed printers using standardWindows drivers.andP;  To activate or deactivate, the user must reconfigure ATMand then reopen Windows.andM;FaceLift lets the user activate and deactivate individual standard Windowsprinter drivers on-the-fly.andM;Another major difference between these three applications is the use andavailability of the required typeface formats.andM;Aside from general support at the operating-system level, such as in Windows,many drawing programs now use typeface outlines directly.andP;  Corel Draw, forexample, supports most of the major typeface outline formats, including Type1, whereas Micrografx Designer can import Bitstream Speedo but not Type 1typeface outlines.andM;Typeface availability is the other crucial question.andP;  Atech-format Font Packsare the least expensive and the most limited in choices.andP;  However, there'senough flexibilit in Font Packs for most standalone systems.andM;Bitstream Speedo-format typefaces are presented as an upgrade from theFontware format.andP;  In fact, when Apple (System 7) and Microsoft (upgrades toWindows and OS/2) provide support, Bitstream plans to offer a further upgradeto TrueType.andM;While the price of type is dropping, it's not inconsequential.andP;  A policy ofupgrading or changing type formats is bound to lead to incompatibilitiesacross platforms and printers.andP;  Since there's only one Type 1 format,however, PostScript's Type 1 strength is its timeless applicability across awide variety of platforms and printers.andM;David Dean, author of &quot;Using Microsoft word for Windows,&quot;
