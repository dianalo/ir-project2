In an interview, Mr. Rabin said that after Arab leaders at last month's summit meeting in Jordan made the Iran-Iraq war their first priority -- and thereby made Iran, at least temporarily, Arab enemy No. 1 -- those groups that opposed that position have sought to highlight the war with Israel. This effort is led by Syria, Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon and Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, he said.    Mr. Rabin predicted that the violence in Gaza, a strip of Mediterranean seacoast that Israel has occupied since capturing it from Egypt in 1967, would end within a week. He stressed Israel's determination to crush any public disorder with force. (Yesterday, Israel sent tanks, other armored vehicles and hundreds of new troops to Gaza.) &quot;We have to make clear that war, terror and violent public disorder will lead nowhere,&quot; the defense minister said.    While saying that he couldn't be sure of all the reasons for the eruption of violence at this time, he mentioned the PLO's traditional desire to mark with new action the January anniversary of its first military action. He didn't cite local conditions in Gaza, where about 650,000 Palestinians, most in refugee camps, live on 140 square miles of land.    Israel puts the casualties in the Gaza violence at eight dead and 29 wounded. Arab reports say 15 Palestinians have been killed and more than 100 wounded.    Mr. Rabin reiterated a long-held Israeli position that the only way to settle the future of these occupied territories is in a general Israel-Arab peace negotiation in which Israel's main negotiating partner would be Jordan. He added, however, that he isn't optimistic about the chances for a peace conference in 1988.    The Labor Party, to which Mr. Rabin belongs, favors an international conference, but Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his Likud bloc are opposed. Mr. Rabin cited next year's elections in both Israel and the U.S. as factors that made a conference unlikely.    Mr. Rabin has just finished two days of talks with U.S. defense officials and members of Congress aimed at finding ways to reduce the price of the F-16 fighter planes that Israel wants to buy to take the place of the Lavi fighter. Israel was building the fighter but abandoned it in August, under pressure from Washington, because of its huge cost.    Mr. Rabin said Israel hopes to lower by between $75 million and $100 million the price for the between 60 and 75 General Dynamics Corp. planes it is ordering. After meeting with Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, representatives of General Dynamics and members of Congress, he said: &quot;I tend to believe the final price will be what we are seeking.&quot;    In Washington, Mr. Rabin also signed a memo of understanding formalizing the right of Israeli defense companies to bid on a range of Pentagon projects. Israel's defense industry has been hard hit by a cutback in Israeli defense spending, shrinking markets and new competition from other arms-building nations. </TEXT></DOC>
