Both men were quoted by the agency as saying they participatedin a series of meetings at Abidjan hotels to plan the invasion.   Podier was one of 17 enlisted men and non-commissioned officersled by then-Master Sgt. Doe who seized control of Liberia in anApril 12, 1980 coup. President William R. Tolbert was killed.   After the coup, Doe established the People's Redemption Council,which ruled by decree until 1985 elections returned Liberia tocivilian rule with Doe as president.
