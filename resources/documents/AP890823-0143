Syria has computerized radar capable of detecting ships andproviding target data for long-range artillery, but the militias donot.   Christian and Syrian forces fought sporadic duels in and aroundBeirut in the artillery war that began March 8. Police said oneperson was killed and 15 were wounded, bringing the total to 790killed and 2,205 wounded.   Nearly all casualties have been civilians in the battle betweenthe 20,000-man Christian army command of Gen. Michel Aoun and theMoslem alliance led by the Syrians, whose 40,000 soldiers in Lebanoncontrol 70 percent of its territory.   An Algerian emigre being expelled from France hijacked an AirFrance jetliner and, after it landed in Algiers, demanded aninternational conference on Lebanon. None of the 102 passengers and13 crew members was hurt.   Foreign ministers of the European Community, of which France isthe current president, called for an immediate cease-fire in Lebanonand said they would send a fact-finding mission to Beirut. The U.N.Security Council passed a truce resolution Aug. 15 and fightingabated, but did not stop.   In New York, U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani saidSecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is sending key aideJean-Claude Aime to the region. He said Aime will arrive Friday, inRabat, Morocco, to confer with an Arab League committee that hasbeen trying in vain to arrange a lasting cease-fire in Lebanon andwork out a political solution to the civil war.   Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, president of the United ArabEmirates, urged the Arab League to hold a summit immediately andsend Arab peacekeeping troops to Lebanon, the weekly Al-Hawadessreported.   ``If Lebanon collapses, that will be the end of the ArabLeague,'' Zayed was quoted as saying in an interview with theLondon-based weekly. It was distributed by the official Emiratesnews agency.   The Syrians are in Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeepingmandate issued in 1976, when the Lebanese civil war was a year old.They consider Lebanon in their sphere of influence and vetoedproposals to send Arab troops made during an Arab League summit inMay.   Soviet envoy Gennady Terrosov arrived in Damascus on Wednesdayand met with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, official Syrianmedia reported. Syria is Moscow's main ally in the Middle East.   France has sent six ships to the eastern Mediterranean, led bythe aircraft carrier Foch carrying nearly 2,000 marines.   President Francois Mitterrand's government says they are on ahumanitarian mission, to evacuate the 7,000 French nationals inLebanon if necessary. France governed Lebanon under mandate from theend of World War I until 1943.   The flotilla was originally to consist of eight vessels, butFrench Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said on Wednesdaythat six were being sent.   The Lebanese Nationalist Front, a grouping of 11 pro-Syrianfactions, said in a statement the French were committing ``an act ofaggression directed against the people of Lebanon and the nation'ssovereignty and independence.''   It said the front's estimated 10,000 combatants had been put onalert, with orders to ``deter violently such an aggression.''   ``Any French naval presence off the Lebanese coast will beshelled,'' the statement said, and France will be ``held fullyresponsible for the repercussions resulting from any act ofaggression.''   After a meeting with Cabinet ministers Wednesday, Mitterrandsaid: ``No country or group can dictate to France what it should doin Lebanon.''   Aoun said in an interview with the French daily France-Soir hehad received ``little munitions from Iraq, as well as from France,''in the past two months.   He also was quoted as saying: ``I expect (the French ships) to beput at my disposition to assure freedom of movement in territorialwaters.''   Iraq, Syria's chief Arab foe, is the main arms supplier toChristian forces.   In Paris, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry denied supplyingarms.   Aoun's soldiers and 1 million Christian civilians are bottled upin a 310-square-mile enclave north and east of Beirut whose onlyoutlets are ports on the Christian-held coast north of the capital.Syrian gunners reguarly shell the coast to keep supply ships fromlanding.</TEXT></DOC>
