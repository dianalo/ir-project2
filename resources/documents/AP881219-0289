The United States has threatened retaliation against EEC importsof, among others, boneless ham, canned tomatoes, fruit juices andalcoholic beverages. Italy, Denmark and Spain would be most affectedby that.   The EEC foreign ministers, meeting here Monday, accepted arecommendation by EEC External Relations Commissioner Willy DeClercq not to postpone the ban again.   Late last year, the EEC delayed the ban's implementation untilJan. 1.   ``We do not envisage a new delay as there were no political ortechnical reasons'' to do so, De Clercq told reporters.   De Clercq said the ban will affect between $130 million and $150million of U.S. meat exports a year. U.S. estimates have put thefigure at $170 million.   ``We're extremely disappointed; we had hoped that reason mightprevail,'' said Thomas O. Kay, administrator of USDA's ForeignAgricultural Service. ``If that's the decision that they've made, Isuppose we have no other recourse except retaliation.''   Alfred Kingon, the U.S. envoy to the EEC, told reporters that ifthe EEC counterattacked against U.S. retaliation, the United Stateswould itself take further steps. ``It is fair to assume we will dosomething in response. We are working on it,'' he said.   Klingon said the United States asked the EEC on Friday to delaythe ban for a brief period to allow a new U.S. administration and anew EEC executive Commission, which both take office in January, tosettle the dispute. He said he was disappointed the EEC did not have``the flexibility or the willingness'' to grant the request.   De Clercq said the EEC will exempt pet food from its ban importsof U.S. meat but added, ``We do not expect the Americans to acceptthis.''   He repeated the ban will be imposed for public health reasons.But the United States argues the use of hormones to fatten animalsposes no health risk and has said the pet food exemption did notremove its concerns.   The EEC says pet food accounts for about half of the U.S. importsbut U.S. officials say it represents only 30 percent.   The EEC foreign ministers also tentatively agreed to counter anyU.S. trade retaliation in reaction to the EEC ban on meat imports,De Clercq said.   This would involve a 100 percent duty on U.S. exports to the EECof honey, unshelled nuts, dried fruit and canned corn that total$140.5 million a year. But De Clercq said a final decision will onlybe made after Washington retaliates against the EEC hormone ban.   Depending on the extent of U.S. retaliation, other products mightbe added to the list, De Clercq said.   Speaking of recent meetings with U.S. officials to avert atrans-Atlantic trade war over the hormone ban, De Clercq said``dialogue of the deaf'' was continuing.   He said the EEC was interested in limiting the damage of theconflict by finding ways to narrow the extent of a possible tradewar.   In late November, De Clercq warned U.S. retaliation against theEEC ban would spark both retaliatory measures and action against theUnited States within the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade.   The EEC has said its ban on hormone-treated meat is legal underthe rules of the GATT, the 96-nation world trade organization.</TEXT></DOC>
