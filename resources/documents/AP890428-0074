Deen Mohammad, national security minister of the insurgents'provisional government, said the guerrillas fighting in easternAfghanistan overran the Chaprahar valley and pushed to within 2{miles of Jalalabad airport.   The attack, which reportedly concentrated on the Afghan army's81st Regiment, coincided with the 11th anniversary of a bloodymilitary coup in which the communists seized power in Afghanistan.   Guerrillas captured three major army posts and 34 small ones,and destroyed eight tanks and captured five, Deen said in astatement.   It gave no details of guerrilla casualties. But onepro-guerrilla source said the ``heavy fighting left several peopledead on both sides.''   Deen's statement claimed the insurgents killed as many as 125government troops since Tuesday and captured 44, including fourofficers.   Afghan government forces have been defending Jalalabad against aguerrilla offensive since March 6. The city is 40 miles from theborder with Pakistan, where the insurgents have their headquarters.   The siege is the first major offensive by Moslem guerrillassince Soviet troops completed their withdrawal on Feb. 15 and endedtheir nine year intervention in Afghanistan's civil war.   Government security forces still hold key cities. But theinsurgents, backed mainly by Pakistan and the United States,reportedly control more than 90 percent of the ravaged countryside.   Jalalabad, with a prewar population of 67,000, would give theguerrillas a strategic foothold to launch an attack on Kabul, 70miles to the west, and advance their fight to establish an Islamicrepublic.</TEXT></DOC>
