Mr. Abrams, a former assistant secretary of state, pleadedguilty to two misdemeanor charges as part of an agreementunder which he must cooperate in a continuing investigationof the Iran-Contra affair by Independent Counsel LawrenceWalsh.</LP><TEXT>   Craig Gillen, Mr. Walsh's associate counsel whorepresented the prosecutor at the court proceedings, wascautious in assessing Mr. Abrams's value to the inquiry. Butas a senior Reagan administration official, Mr. Abrams movedin high circles and could shed light on the activities ofWhite House and Central Intelligence Agency officers inconnection with the same covert supply network.   Duane Clarridge, a Central Intelligence Agency officer whohad been closely involved in the anti-Sandinista war, hasbeen identified as a target of Mr. Walsh's inquiry. And theprosecutor has given immunity to a former associate of DonaldGregg, a national security adviser to then-Vice PresidentBush and now U.S. ambassador to South Korea.   The charges against Mr. Abrams, which carry a maximumpenalty of one year in prison for each count, are themselvesthe product of an earlier agreement in which Mr. Walsh'soffice won the cooperation of Alan Fiers, who headed theCIA's Central America task force in the mid-80s. Mr. Fiersalso pleaded guilty to withholding information from Congress,and his testimony was instrumental in the case against Mr.Abrams and in the more serious perjury charges brought lastmonth against the CIA's former operations chief, ClairGeorge.   With his hands clasped behind his back, the 43-year-oldMr. Abrams answered simply &quot;I plead guilty&quot; after U.S.district Judge Aubrey Robinson read each of the countsagainst him. In a brief statement later, Mr. Abrams showedflashes of his old defiance, but he was a far more subduedfigure than the brash assistant secretary who symbolized ageneration of young neo-conservatives in the Reaganadministration. Many, like Mr. Abrams, had watched Vietnamfrom academic campuses and had little patience with Congressas they waged their proxy wars against communism from thehalls of Washington.   A former Senate aide, Mr. Abrams infuriated Republicansand Democrats alike in the Capitol, and yesterday's chargesfocus on misleading testimony he gave in October 1986 after acargo plane ferrying supplies to the Contras was shot down inNicaragua. Appearing before Senate and House committees, Mr.Abrams sought to distance the Reagan administration from thesupply network, and though he had directly solicited a $10million contribution from the sultan of Brunei two monthsearlier, he denied that foreign governments were helping theContras.   At the time of his testimony, the administration was onlydays away from overturning a ban on U.S. funding for the war.In a statement of facts accompanying yesterday's pleaagreement, Mr. Abrams is said to have feared that thisappropriations legislation would be lost if members learnedof the network.   As assistant secretary, his specific knowledge grew out ofa close working relationship with Mr. Fiers and Marine Lt.Col. Oliver North, a White House aide who oversaw the supplyoperation and served on a restricted interagency group headedby Mr. Abrams.   Beginning in 1985, the court papers said, Mr. Abramsbecame &quot;generally aware&quot; that Col. North was working with theContras, and he and Mr. Fiers had specifically discussedusing the White House aide's &quot;private benefactor&quot; network inJuly 1986 to get food to the insurgents when a government&quot;humanitarian&quot; aid program ran out of funds.   Using the pseudonym &quot;Kennilworth,&quot; Mr. Abrams met with arepresentative of the sultan of Brunei in a London park inAugust that summer. The court papers show that before histestimony in October, he was privy to subsequent StateDepartment cables showing that the sultan had agreed to give$10 million and sent the money on to a Swiss bank accountthat Col. North told Mr. Abrams about.   Standing before television cameras later, Mr. Abramsrestated his guilty plea, but said the information withheldhad only to do with activities &quot;which at that time I believedto be proper and lawful.&quot; The former assistant secretary, thefirst State Department official to be charged by Mr. Walsh,expressed pride in his government service, but said he was&quot;very happy to have this entire matter at long last behindme.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
