They lost in aneerily familiar way. They lost by two points -- 16-14 this time -- on a MattBahr field goal in the final seconds. You'd call it a heartbreaker, exceptthat the 49ers seemed fortunate to be as close as they were, leading 14-13with 0:10 showing on the clock. It was guts, not performance, that got themthat far.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BEST NEWS FOR YOUNG: IT GETS EASIER  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Giants 16, 49ers 14  </MEMO><TEXT>     The pass defense was full of holes. The offense sputtered. The 49ers werepenalized four times in the first 11 minutes of the game. The punting gamefeatured bad snaps followed by bad punts resulting in chronically bad fieldposition.;   Most distressing, though, was the quarterbacking of Steve Young.In the first of (at least) four stand-in performances for the ailing JoeMontana, Young was mostly ineffective.;   Young said he felt good about hisplay, but the numbers showed only 12 completions (in 22 tries) for 162 yards.It went beyond numbers, too. Young looked jittery, though he insistedotherwise. In short, he looked liked a backup quarterback who had been pressedinto duty. Which he is. But Young, we have long thought, was special.;   Andwe should hold that thought now.;   We should hold that thought, because ofthe circumstances Monday night. Young was up against the Giants' defense, aSuper Bowl-winning group. Moreover, he was up against as tough a crowd asthere is -- 76,319 of New York's mouthiest people.;   Importantly, Young'steammates and coaches were fully behind him after the loss.;   &quot;He was cool(in the huddle),&quot; said center Jesse Sapolu. &quot;Steve's a pro. He has been to thebig game before. The more Steve plays, the better he's going to get.&quot;;   CoachGeorge Seifert said, &quot;He moved the club. A lot of times, he started in a hole.When you play against a very good defense, like theirs, and you're constantlystarting in dangerous territory, well . . .&quot;;   The fact is, Young wastentative much of the night. He was slow to see receivers, slower letting goof the ball. He threw one interception, but it easily could have been three orfour.;   And, despite all that, Young had the 49ers sniffing victory with fiveminutes to play. Against the vaunted New York defense, against the vocal NewYork crowd, Young and the 49ers led 14-13 when the Giants took over on theirown 22 with 4 minutes, 40 seconds to play.;   Young accomplished that bit ofmagic largely on one play and one drive. The play was a 73-yard touchdown passto Jerry Rice in the first quarter. The drive was a 42-yard march in thefourth quarter that Young finished by running 5 yards for the go-ahead TD.;  &quot;You're seeing a good quarterback in Steve Young,&quot; said Carl Banks, theGiants' linebacker. &quot;I don't think they've lost anything in ability. Montana'sa winner and he knows how to pull 'em out, but he's got good people around himand those same people are around Steve Young.&quot;;   Said Giants defensive endLeonard Marshall, the man who broke Montana's hand in the NFC title game lastseason, perhaps starting all these problems, &quot;Steve adds a dimension to theiroffense. He runs the ball a lot more than Joe would and, as a defense, youhave to respect that. Their situation reminds me so much of ours. Jeff(Hostetler) is a runner, and Phil (Simms) is a pocket passer.&quot;;   Hostetler'sperformance seemed considerably more impressive than Young's, although thenumbers didn't reflect a great difference. The Giants' QB completed 17 passes(in 31 tries) for 228 yards. Like Young, he rushed for an additional 45 yards.Like Young, he engineered a late drive to put his team ahead. Hostetler'sdrive came later -- that was the difference.;   But make no mistake, more wasexpected of Young on Monday night and more will be required of him in upcomingweeks. As he headed for the team bus after midnight, Seifert said, &quot;He'll befine.&quot;;   And he probably will. Sunday, Young and the 49ers play the San DiegoChargers at Candlestick Park.; STEVE YOUNG ON THIRD DOWN; Steve Young was only3 for 9 in third-down conversions. Here's a look at how he did in the clutch:;First quarter; (box) 3rd andamp; 8/SF 22: Young pass to Rathman for 7 yards.;  (box) 3 andamp; 9/SF 27: Young pass to Rice for 73-yard touchdown.; Second quarter;(box) 3rd andamp; 6/SF 21: Young sacked for minus-10.;   (box) 3rd andamp; 1/SF 29: Youngpass to Rathman for 4 yards.;   (box) 3rd andamp; 7/SF 36: Young pass incomplete.;  (box) 3rd andamp; 2/SF 27: Young pass incomplete.; Third quarter; (box) 3rd andamp; 14/NY40: Young pass incomplete.; Fourth quarter; (box) 3rd andamp; 9 / NY 18: Young passto Jones for 13.;   (box) 3rd andamp; 18/NY 40: Young pass incomplete.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Bud Geracie column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  East Rutherford, N.J.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910903  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  908  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, September 3, 199100247015,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
