(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eleven people were arrested in apoaching sting that uncovered the slaughter of more than 400 blackbears for their gall bladders, which are prized as aphrodisiacs inthe Far East.   ``This is just the tip of this particular iceberg,'' said WalterBickford, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Fisheries,Wildlife and Environmental Law Enforcement. ``We're aware ofnumerous other operations like this in Massachusetts.''   The arrests were made in raids that began at 6 a.m. Tuesday inMassachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Florida, wildlifeofficials said.   The raids were the culmination of a 2{-year investigation that``tracked approximately $50,000 in transactions involving everythingfrom endangered species to black bear gall bladders.''   ``This operation is the most extensive ever conducted in theNortheast,'' said Alan McGroary, director of the MassachusettsDivision of Environmental Law Enforcement.   Some of the dozens of pelts and gall bladders confiscated in theraids were displayed at a news conference. Among the pelts werethose of a mountain lion and several bobcats.   Also displayed were videotapes and photographs of 27 bearcarcasses piled in a meadow in the Catskills. Bickford saidinvestigators bought at least 360 gall bladders in addition tocarcasses and skins.   He said the number of black bears apparently slaughtered fortheir gall bladders nearly equaled the black bear population inMassachusetts. Most of the bears were taken in Maine, New Hampshireand Canada, he said.   The arresting officers also confiscated boxes of pills that weresaid to contain small amounts of rhinoceros horn, which hold thesame value in the Far East as the gall bladders.   ``This is a primitive superstition,'' said Bickford. ``There isno proof whatsoever'' that the bear organs or rhinoceros horns areaphrodisiacs, he said.   The superstition, however, has pushed the street value of dried,powdered black bear gall bladders overseas above that of heroin orcocaine in the United States, Bickford said. The powder can sell for$540 an ounce or more.   The investigation was led by two field officers fromMassachusetts and New York, who took part in what Bickford describedas strange rituals in their undercover work.   One ritual involved christening new pickup trucks ``by building abed of dead deer carcasses. ... When you're dealing with a grouplike this, you're talking about some bizarre behavior,'' he said.   Three of the arrested people were from Massachusetts, three morewere from Connecticut, four from New Hampshire and one was arrestedin Florida. Wildlife officials said more arrests were expected.   The arrested people jointly face more than 100 counts, rangingfrom illegal hunting to practicing taxidermy without a license.Penalties for each count range up to one year in prison and $1,000in fines.   The sale of black bear gall bladders is forbidden in most states,although the bears may legally be hunted in many. In Massachusetts,only the sale of the head, hide and hooves of deer is permittedunder certain conditions.   McGroary said the investigation began when Massachusetts gameofficials uncovered evidence that a Connecticut meat dealer hadillegally supplied venison to a western Massachusetts restaurant herefused to identify.</TEXT></DOC>
