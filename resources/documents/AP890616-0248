On other markets, energy prices tumbled; grains and soybeans weremixed; and precious metals retreated.   Live cattle settled .13 cent to .30 cent higher with the contractfor delivery in June at 71.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle wereunchanged to .18 cent lower with August at 80.97 cents a pound; livehogs were .05 cent to .60 cent higher with June at 48.22 cents apound; frozen pork bellies were .38 cent lower to 1.15 cents higherwitth July at 33.92 cents a pound.   Cattle futures prices had been rising ahead of the AgricultureDepartment's monthly cattle-on-feed report.   Expectations were that it would show about a 15 percent declinein the number of cattle placed on feedlots last month in the sevenlargest producer states compared with the record-high placements ofMay 1988.   But the USDA indicated an even sharper drop in May placements,reporting 25 percent fewer cattle were moved from pastures tofeedlots last month than a year ago.   The seven-state total of 1.6 million cattle was 11 percent belowthe 10-year average and represented the lightest May placementssince 1981. The placements brought the total number of cattle onfeed in the seven states to 7.5 million, 3 percent below a year ago.   There are two major reasons for the lower placements. Last year'sdrought dried up pasturelands and forced calf-and-cattle producersto sell more of their animals to feedlots earlier in the year thannormal, which led to record-high placements in May 1988.   This year's spring rains had the opposite effect.   ``The rain improved your pasture conditions and just slowed downthat movement of cattle off of pastures into the feedlots,'' saidDale Durchholz of Agri-Visor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.   The low placements will result in tighter supplies ofslaughter-ready cattle in late summer and early fall, and willlikely push cattle and beef prices higher.   Analysts said the contracts for August and October cattledeliveries should see the greatest gains on Monday, with pricesexpected to open .50 cent to 1 cent higher.   Petroleum futures prices plummeted on the New York MercantileExchange on signs of easing supplies of crude oil for promptdelivery and reports that the OPEC cartel may raise its productionceiling by 1 million barrels per day in September.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 62 centslower with July at $19.95 a barrel; heating oil was .21 cent to .63lower with July at 45.71 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.34cents lower to .10 cent higher with July at 58.14 cents a gallon.   Most corn and soybean futures posted strong gains on the ChicagoBoard of Trade, boosted by forecasts for a warmup in the Midwestnext week. Wheat futures closed mixed.   Corn futures also were supported by expectations the AgricultureDepartment will extend certain corn loans to farmers, which wouldkeep in storage some corn that would otherwise move onto the market.   Wheat settled unchanged to 3\ cents higher with the contract fordelivery in July at $3.94\ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to 3{cents higher with July at $2.62} a bushel; oats were \ cent to 2cents lower with July at $1.64{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lowerto 7{ cents higher with July at $7.33 a bushel.   Gold and silver futures prices fell modesty after rising for fourstraight days on New York's Commodity Exchange.   Gold settled $1.90 to $2 lower with August at $368.80 a troyounce; silver was 0.6 cent to 2.5 cents lower with July at $5.305 atroy ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
