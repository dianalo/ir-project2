By applying advanced econometrictechniques to arms level data, the historical behavior of the nationsmay be dissected. The findings thus obtained may be compared to previousempirical findings and to the predictions of the theoretical literatureon arms races. The major findings of this work are as follows. First,that there is interaction between the various components of the nucleararsenals of the US and Soviet Union. Previous studies that examined onlystrategic aggregates missed these interactions. Second, the SALT I treatydid not significantly alter the behavior of these nations. Third, thenuclear-armed NATO nations (Great Britain and France) and possibly thePeople's Republic of China are important in determining the overall strategicposture of the US and USSR. Finally, process through which the arms levelsof the nations studies are determined yield stationary time-series. Thatis, there is not an arms race with weapons levels spiraling upward indefinitelybut a process that is stable in the short run.</TEXT></DOC>
