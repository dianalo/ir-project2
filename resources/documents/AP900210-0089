Lattie liked to play with his toy cars, dance silly with hisbrother, watch cartoons and romp in the mud outside when theweather was warm.   But Lattie's joyous childhood vanished the summer of 1987, asummer of torture. Testimony about the agonies he endured shockedprosecutors, defense attorneys and even the judge.   Lattie's mother and her live-in boyfriend, who said he beatLattie and his brother because he thought they were homosexual, areto be sentenced Thursday by Cook County Criminal Court JudgeMichael B. Getty.   Getty called Lattie's death ``the most heinous, brutallysadistic torture and murder ... that I have ever heard in my 6{years as a judge, my over 10 years as a prosecutor, or indeed my 51years on this Earth.''   Lattie was starved, burned with a hot iron, stuck with pins andneedles, singed with cigarettes, beaten with a tree branch, hairbrush, belt and hands, scalded with steaming water, and tied upwith a clothesline, rope and tights for 2{ months that summer,court testimony showed.   A severe blow to his head in August was the eventual cause ofdeath, but his emaciated body, scarred from head to foot, was soinfected from untreated wounds that he likely would have died ashort time later, a pathologist from the county medical examiner'soffice testified.   Criminal convictions in abuse cases are more an exception thanthe rule unless the child dies, said Dr. Demetra Soter, coordinatorof the Pediatric Trauma Unit at Cook County Hospital.   Abuse cases often are not prosecuted, or even investigated,until the victim is killed because ``people in high levels ofposition can't believe that people torture children,'' she said.``Hopefully with people seeing stuff like this, they'll start tobelieve that it really happens.''   Lattie's was one of 40,278 reported cases of child abuse orneglect in Cook County in 1987 and one of 38 reported deaths, saidDavid Schneidman, a spokesman for the state Department of Childrenand Family Services. Statewide, there were 91,723 cases and 54deaths, he said.   The numbers are worse for 1988, the most recent period for whichstatistics are available. In Cook County, 54 of the 42,564 reportedabuse or neglect cases ended in death, Schneidman said. Statewide,91,723 cases of abuse or neglect and 98 deaths were reported.   The night before Lattie died, his mother's boyfriend, JohnnyCampbell, taped potato peels over the boy's eyes and hung him inthe closet, court records show.   When Lattie was taken down the next day, Aug. 14, 1987, andasked for water, Campbell told him to act like a man and get ithimself. Lattie tried, but, sapped of strength, failed. Campbellpunched him in the head, the records show.   When Lattie didn't move, his mother called an ambulance. He waspronounced dead on arrival at South Shore Hospital. Lattie weighed26 pounds, the size of a normal 1-year-old.   Dr. Shaku Teas, the pathologist who did the autopsy, was askedby a prosecutor if she found anything remarkable about his injuries.   ``Everything was remarkable,'' she said, describing his injuriesin gruesome detail as photographs of his body were shown in court.   His pelvis had been broken several days before he died, and twoof his ribs had been snapped several weeks earlier, Ms. Teastestified.   Campbell, 40, pleaded guilty Dec. 6 to murdering Lattie andbeating the boy's brother, Cornelius Abraham, now 8. His attorneysays Campbell is psychotic.   On Jan. 11, Getty convicted the children's 28-year-old mother,Alicia Abraham, on the same charges; she acknowledged neverreporting the torture of her children but said she did not abusethem herself.   Prosecutors have urged Getty to order the pair executed for whatAssistant State's Attorney James Bigoness called ``a trulyabominable crime.''   ``It's probably one of the ugliest cases you will ever see,''said Clyde Lemons Jr., Ms. Abraham's attorney, who argued that shewas guilty of bad judgment but was not a murderer.   Lavonne Steger, 18, whose parents cared for Ms. Abraham as achild when her own parents died, still cries when talking aboutLattie. She considers Ms. Abraham her sister and often played withthe children when they were brought over for a visit.   Cornelius liked to play basketball and read. Lattie was a quietboy with shining dark eyes and a sweet smile.   ``He liked to go outside and play in the mud,'' Miss Steger saidin a telephone interview, her voice at times choking with emotion.Other days, ``He just liked to watch cartoons and play with hiscars. He was happy.''   Lattie was the second child born to Ms. Abraham. A small, stockywoman, she dropped out of South Shore High School when she becamepregnant with Cornelius and had Lattie two years later. She nevermarried the boys' father, Lattie McGee Sr., an attendant at thecounty's home for juvenile delinquents.   The couple were together five years until splitting up in 1984,and she had another son and a daughter with another man. Theyounger children live with their paternal grandmother, under legalguardianship of the Department of Children and Family Services.   McGee, who now has Cornelius, could not be reached to talk aboutthe case. Calls to his home went unanswered or were disconnectedwhen a reporter called.   Unemployed and on public aid, Ms. Abraham was accused of neglectin 1985 after state authorities found her living in a filthyapartment with no furniture. Her sons slept on the floor and wereinadequately fed, court records show.   Ms. Abraham underwent counseling. After months of supervision,state investigators determined the situation had improved.   But then she met Johnny Campbell, a short, fine-boned man withpowerfully muscled arms who said he was a Vietnam veteran andex-steel worker who'd been fired for alcohol and drug abuse.   In early 1987, Campbell moved into the small apartment Ms.Abraham shared with her four children on the top floor of a tidysix-story brick apartment building in the South Shore district, ablack, mostly middle-class neighborhood along Chicago's southernlakefront.   Lattie's father, who kept in touch with his boys and hasattended court proceedings, last saw them in early June 1987 whenCornelius graduated from kindergarten, Bigoness said. Both childrenappeared healthy.   Things quickly changed.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
