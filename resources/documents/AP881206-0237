The investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. said in astatement that Jan. 11 was the deadline for RJR stockholders tosubmit their shares.   Kohlberg will pay $109 a share in cash for 72 percent of RJR'soutstanding shares. But if all shareholders tender their shares, asexpected, each will receive $81 a share in cash and $28 a share insecurities.   The investment firm also said it intended to file additionalinformation on Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commissionconcerning financing arrangements, investment banking fees and otherdetails.   Kohlberg outmaneuvered a rival offer from RJR's top managers towin a tumultuous bidding contest for the nation's 19th largestindustrial company Nov. 30   The investment firm has said it eventually intends to sell about$6 billion in food assets of RJR, the Atlanta-based maker ofhundreds of products that range from Ritz crackers to Camelcigarettes.   RJR's debt load will more than quadruple under Kohlberg, which isusing only a fraction of its own money for the purchase and willborrow the rest using RJR's assets as collateral, in what iscommonly called a leveraged buyout.   Kohlberg has not specified how many of RJR's senior managers itintends to retain in the company but is expected to terminate thecontracts of those who teamed with chief executive F. Ross Johnsonto make a rival bid. Johnson also is expected to leave but hisintentions are unclear.   RJR's tobacco subsidiary switched assignments of three topexecutives in what it said Monday was likely to be the first of aseries of changes under Kohlberg.   The price tag for RJR is nearly double the previous record for acorporate takeover, the $13.4 billion acquisition of Gulf Oil Corp.by what is now Chevron Corp. in 1984.   The RJR deal is also more than four times the size of previousrecord leveraged buyout, the $6.1 billion sale of Beatrice Cos. in1986 to a group led by Kohlberg.   The scope and complexity of the RJR takeover raised new concernabout the leveraged buyout trend, particularly over whether suchtransactions threaten the nation's economy by multiplying the levelof corporate debt.   Many economists and lawmakers have expressed fear thatdebt-burdened companies such as RJR will forego important strategicinvestments for the sake of paying off debt. Moreover, some say, aslight rise in interest rates can have a devastating impact on suchcompanies by increasing their debt payments.</TEXT></DOC>
