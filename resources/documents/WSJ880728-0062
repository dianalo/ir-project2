But officials familiar with the Fed's recent actions in the credit markets deny any change in monetary policy.    Prices of some actively traded 30-year government bonds fell about 5/8 point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount. Yields on Treasury bills and other money market instruments also spurted.    The rise in rates mostly was a reaction to a move by the Fed early yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system, a move that occasionally results in higher short-term interest rates. The Fed's action was particularly unsettling following a government report showing the nation's gross national product growing at a 3.1% annual rate in the second quarter, and the GNP-based price measure gaining at a 4.1% rate.    The Fed's so-called matched-sale purchase agreements often suggest little more than an attempt by the Fed to maintain its target for reserves. Occasionally, though, the Fed does signal tighter credit and higher interest rates by reducing the amount of reserves in the banking system, thereby making money at the wholesale level more expensive.    &quot;I know there are a lot of people who argue the Fed's action was purely technical, but we're in the midst of a world-wide movement toward higher rates,&quot; said E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;The (U.S.) economy is strong and inflation is moving up. That's likely to prompt&quot; the Fed to raise the rate on reserves banks lend one another overnight, or federal funds rate, to 8% from a range of 7 1/2%-7 7/8% recently, he predicted.    In Washington, officials familiar with Fed policy indicated that its operations yesterday reflected technical factors rather than an effort to tighten policy. For now, the central bank appears to be satisfied with a fed funds rate of about 7 5/8% to 7 7/8%. The Fed is likely to wait for further signs that inflationary pressures are accelerating before moving to push short-term rates higher.    Some money managers, while convinced that both short-term and long-term interest rates are headed higher, say an imminent change in Fed policy is unlikely. &quot;I'd say we've got a hiatus where nothing happens for awhile,&quot; said William Gross, a managing director at Pacific Investment Management Co., Newport Beach, Calif.    &quot;We've already had a concerted tightening of credit by central banks around the world, so my guess is the Fed rests here and maybe {does nothing different} until the {presidential} election in November,&quot; Mr. Gross added. The Fed &quot;doesn't want to rock the boat more than {it} has to.&quot;    But Mr. Gross, who suddenly turned bearish on the bond market last April, said &quot;there will be a continuation of the rise in the short and long-term rates because the economy keeps growing, inflation is rising and there has been nothing done to reduce the huge {U.S. trade and budget} deficits.&quot;    Treasury Securities   The Treasury's latest 30-year bonds fell to 98 3/4 from 99 3/8 as the yield rose to 9.25% from 9.18%. The government's 10-year notes finished at 99 1/8, down from 99 14/32, while the yield rose to 9.13% from about 9.08%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds, compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., fell 4.89 points to 1216.22. The index ranged between 1214.24 and 1222.89.    Among short-term rates, the latest three-month Treasury bills were quoted late yesterday at 6.99% bid, up from 6.93% bid Tuesday and an average rate of 6.88% set at Monday's auction. The rate on 26-week bills rose slightly to 7.16% bid from 7.10% bid Tuesday and from an auction average of 7.09%.    Yesterday, the Treasury sold $8.78 billion of two-year notes at an average yield of 8.41%. The yield was up from 8.05% at the previous two-year note auction on June 22 and was the highest since 8.57% last Sept. 29.    The Treasury sold an additional $605 million to Federal Reserve banks serving as agents for foreign monetary institutions and $1.48 billion to government accounts and Federal Reserve banks for their own accounts in exchange for maturing securities.    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                                            2-Year Notes Applications ......................... $23,516,095,000 Accepted bids ......................... $8,781,700,000 Accepted at low price ............................ 67% Accepted noncompetitively ............. $1,366,000,000 Average price (Rate) ................... 99.937(8.41%) High price (Rate) ...................... 99.955(8.40%) Low price (Rate) ....................... 99.919(8.42%) Interest rate ................................. 8 3/8%   The notes are dated Aug. 1 and mature July 31, 1990.   Foreign Bonds   British and West German government bonds gained while Canadian and Japanese issues showed declines in quiet trading.   Prices of Japanese government bonds fell as the Ministry of Finance and the government's underwriting syndicate discussed possible terms for the August 10-year bond issue. It is highly likely the 800 billion-yen issue will be priced as 5% bonds at 99 to yield 5.151%, government bond specialists said.   In secondary trading, the No. 112 July 5% bonds were offered at 5.24%. The bellwether 5% No. 105s of 1997 fell to 100.28 for a yield of 4.985%, up three basis points.   Separately, financial institutions that issue bonds, such as the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, trust banks and life insurance companies, jointly announced that for the first time in 10 months they will raise the long-term prime rate 0.2 percentage point to 5.7% as of Aug. 1, according to a Japanese news service.   The action will be taken along with the scheduled coupon rate increase on the benchmark August issue of five-year interest-bearing bank debentures, to be sold today, from 4.6% to 4.8%, according to Nikkei Telecom, a news service of Nihon Keizai Shimbun Inc. Interest rates on housing loans will remain unchanged in view of the relatively small increase in the long-term prime rate, the report said.   West German government bonds rose as much as 0.15 percentage point in sluggish trading, boosted by the dollar's slide against the mark. The government's 6 1/2% bonds due 1998 rose 0.10 point to 97.80 bid to yield 6.81%. Late Tuesday, the yield on the issue was 6.83%. Trading was slowed partly by speculation that the Bundesbank might raise the key short-term Lombard rate to 5% from 4 1/2% at its Central Bank Council meeting today.   Most British government bonds gained as traders and investors appeared to shrug off potentially disturbing government trade news. British trade data showed that the country's current account gap narrowed only slightly to 1.021 billion pounds in June from 1.144 billion pounds in May.   Some analysts said this confirmed other signs of high domestic demand and the need for relatively high interest rates in Britain. &quot;Any weakness in the pound is likely to be translated into further base rate increases,&quot; said Mark Odescalchi, a director of James Capel Gilts.   The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 rose 1/4 point to 115 23/32 to yield 9.70%.   Prices of most Canadian government bonds were little changed in quiet trading. The government's 9 1/2% bonds due 1998 fell 1/8 point to 97 bid to yield 9.97%.   Mortgage-Backed Issues   A spate of Remic activity continued to bolster the mortgage securities market in the face of moderate losses in the Treasury market.   Three new deals totaling $600 million were offered yesterday, bringing issuance so far this week to $1.45 billion. Traders said more Remic deals are planned by week's end.   New Remics, or real estate mortgage investment conduits, support the mortgage market because underwriters have to purchase pass-throughs securities to back the Remics.   Among active mortgage issues, August Ginnie Mae 9% securities ended at 93 19/32, down 5/32; 9 1/2% securities at 96 1/2, down 3/32; and 10% securities at 99 13/32, down 6/32.   The 10% bonds are yielding 10.22% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread to the 10-year Treasury note tightened two basis points to 109 basis points. The 10-year note dropped 3/8 to 99 2/32.   The pick-up in Remic issuance, which has caught some market participants by surprise, demonstrates the ability of underwriters to market complicated securities in the face of a host of obstacles. The problems include a scarcity of fixed-rate mortgage securities, tight mortgage-Treasury spreads and a flattening yield curve.   Agency Bonds   The Financing Corp., a government-sponsored institution set up last August to raise funds for the ailing Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., priced $600 million of 10.35% 30-year bonds at 99.875 to yield 10.36%.   Several concerns yesterday said they sold the securities in so-called stripped form as zero coupon bonds.   The last public FICO sale, on March 30, consisted of $300 million of 9.80% bonds due in 30 years. They were priced at that time to yield about 9.83%, which was 1.04 percentage point above the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds of 2017. These FICO bonds are now trading at about the originally quoted spread.   The spread between FICO bonds and Treasury bonds has widened this year because of growing concern about FSLIC's financial condition.   Municipals   Prices of municipal bonds were mostly unchanged despite the sell-off in the government bond market. Traders said tax-exempt issues generally benefited from a paucity of new offerings, a situation that enabled traders to bid up prices for outstanding issues.   New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was quoted late yesterday at 90 7/8 by one major broker, down from that broker's late quote Tuesday of 91-91 1/8. The bond yields 8.01%, compared with about 7.99% late Tuesday.   Corporate Issues   Prices finished the day 1/8 to 3/8 point lower in light trading.   No new issues came to market in the investment-grade sector yesterday but one small junk-bond deal was priced.   Dealers said Divi Hotels N.V.'s $60 million of 10-year senior notes were priced at par to yield 14.5%. The issue was increased in size from the originally planned $50 million.   The issue was also restructured; it was originally expected to be a 15-year senior debenture. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is lead underwriter.   The issue, which is noncallable for five years, is rated single-B-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-B by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.   Secondary market trading activity remained light. Dealers said the lack of new issues and the lower Treasury market have pushed spreads of corporates against Treasurys to narrower levels.   For example, Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp.'s $500 million of 10-year notes are now trading at a spread of close to 42 basis points over Treasurys. The issue came to market July 19 at a spread of 47 basis points over Treasurys.</TEXT></DOC>
