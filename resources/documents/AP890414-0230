Just a few years ago in Japan that would have been unheard of.   Women never went to court.   ``My name is my right,'' said Ms. Sekiguchi, who has publishedscholarly works under her maiden name for 20 years.   Women increasingly are using the legal system to press forchanges in Japan's male-dominated society. Their demands includethe right to retain their maiden names, to receive joint propertyand child support after divorce and to equal treatment in the workplace.   By choosing the courts, they might change the way disputes aresettled in Japan.   ``In general, lawsuits are increasing because everyone isstarting to think more about ways to improve their lives,'' saidMizuho Fukushima, Ms. Sekiguchi's lawyer in the name case.   ``More women are filing lawsuits than ever before. And with morewomen working and more in executive positions, they will be able tobetter afford the costs of lawsuits in the future.''   A group of lawyers and professional women led by Ms. Fukushimais lobbying the Justice Ministry and the Diet, Japan's parliament,to change a law that requires married couples to take the last nameof one or the other spouse. More than 98 percent of wives take thehusband's name.   Ms. Sekiguchi's suit, which is against the University of Libraryand Information Science in Tsukuba, challenges that law.   Ms. Fukushima expects it will take five to 10 years for thelawsuit to proceed through the court system and for her group'slobbying efforts to bear fruit.   She pins more hope on the changing practices of some of Japan'sleading companies, which are starting to allow women to use theirmaiden names.   Women also are taking the lead in divorce cases. Until the early1980s, most divorce actions were begun by men but in 1985, womenfiled 74 percent of the divorce actions in the Tokyo Family Court.   Middle-aged women, who have spent 15 or more years caring forworking husbands and raising children, have become thefastest-growing group to initiate divorce actions.   ``Because of the lack of closeness in their marriages, middleage women have become emotionally independent,'' said Sumiko Iwao,a psychologist at Tokyo's Keio University. ``But Japanese men areemotionally dependent on women. They still believe that when theyretire they will be waited on by their wives as a reward.''   Lawyer Kurumi Nakamura of Tokyo said, ``Lots of women wanteddivorces 10 years ago, too, but they thought they were supposed tobe patient about an unhappy marriage. Nowadays, they don't carewhat other people think about divorce. It's more acceptable tofight back.''   Almost all divorces are resolved by agreement between thespouses or through arbitration. Although 80 percent of women wincustody of their children, few get their share of either thecouple's property or child support.   Almost 95 percent of separated, divorced or unmarried mothersreceived no financial support from the husband or father of thechild, according to a survey in 1986 by the Tokyo Bureau of SocialWelfare.   Ms. Nakamura conceded that despite stronger demands by herclients for half of the couple's property at divorce, they rarelyget it. But property awards to women are gradually increasing.   ``The tendency is for women to question what their rights areand to examine how to attain happiness,'' Ms. Nakamura said. ``Oneday it will seem very natural for them to go to court.''   In another case, 33-year-old librarian Hisako Kawaguchi is suingher employer for transferring her husband, who is employed by thesame company, to a city 170 miles away.   In Japan, company transfers are common, and families are oftendivided for years because of them.   Mrs. Kawaguchi argues in her suit that the Teikoku HormoneManufacturing Co. violated a legal right for married couples tolive together and jointly care for their children.   When Mrs. Kawaguchi told the company that her health would notallow her to keep her job and care for her three children alone, itreplied that family circumstances were irrelevant, she said.   Mrs. Kawaguchi told Kyodo News Service she believed the realreason for the transfer was to force her to resign, since thecompany preferred a younger woman for her job.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed AMs April 19</NOTE></DOC>
