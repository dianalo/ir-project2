Garcia (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> WNEWS MTOR PNC </CO><DATELINE> PHILADELPHIA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Meritor Financial Group recruited Roger Hillas, the respected and seasoned chairman of Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Corp., to take over the troubled thrift.    Joining Meritor as chairman and chief executive officer, the 61-year-old Mr. Hillas will become the boss of Frederick S. Hammer, the current chairman, who is being demoted to president and chief operating officer. Meritor is the parent of PSFS, one of the nation's largest thrifts.    Mr. Hammer, 52, who was recruited in 1985 from a top job at Chase Manhattan Corp. to clean up the mess at Meritor, has struggled for three years to get a grip on its persistent problems. Yesterday, Mr. Hammer was telling people that it was his idea to bring in a more experienced executive above him.    But there were other indications that some of Meritor's directors provided impetus for the change. Outsiders also speculated that federal and state regulators had an indirect hand in the development, since they have pressed Meritor lately to strengthen its balance sheet.    Frank Slattery, one of four Meritor shareholders who joined the board in March, said regulators never told the board &quot;that Fred has to be taken out.&quot; Mr. Hammer also denied any regulatory involvement in the switch.    But in a telephone interview, Mr. Hammer conceded that Mr. Hillas &quot;has expertise in areas where I don't have the background.&quot; Mr. Hammer also acknowledged that Meritor's board was &quot;surprised&quot; that he supported the idea of recruiting an experienced executive to be his boss.    David Penn, a thrift industry analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore, praised Mr. Hillas's record of having taken Philadelphia's Provident National Bank from a small, local operation to one of the fastest-growing and most profitable regional banks. In contrast, Mr. Penn noted, &quot;Fred never ran a bank until he came to Meritor.&quot;    To take the new job, Mr. Hillas is resigning as chairman of PNC Financial, Pennsylvania's largest bank holding company. PNC was formed in 1983, when Pittsburgh National Bank and Provident National Bank merged. A 37-year veteran of Provident, Mr. Hillas has been its chief executive since 1973.    Yesterday, Meritor stock rose on the news, closing at $5.50, up $1, on heavy volume in national over-the-counter trading.    Investors, analysts and members of the local banking community generally view Mr. Hillas as an able manager with a solid knowledge of the capital markets, a keen eye for evaluating banking companies and their businesses, and a knack for helping fix ailing firms. Friends and subordinates describe him as devoted to Philadelphia. For example, he was instrumental in persuading the Philadelphia Eagles football team not to leave town a few years ago.    Such traits could come in handy at Meritor. The thrift has had only two profitable quarters in the past three years. It is still in the middle of a tortuous restructuring that began last October, and it badly needs to boost its equity. Furthermore, federal regulators are pressing the company to make an accounting change that could wipe out a significant portion of its primary capital.    In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Hillas said that calling the new job a challenge might be &quot;something of an understatement.&quot; About six months ago, he said, he contacted Meritor officials and volunteered to help in whatever way he could. &quot;I have been looking at it on and off for about six months,&quot; he said.    Mr. Hillas, who's making his first big career change, worked his way up through the trust department at Provident National. As part of the bank's special business investment division for nine years, he gained experience in evaluating banking and other business opportunities. He developed a knack for deal making, acquiring small financial-service businesses and divesting them as profitable concerns.    &quot;He's a good negotiator and a problemsolver,&quot; said a Provident Bank insider.    He's also known as a savvy investor in other bank stocks, advising Provident on its own investments as well as guiding the bank's Regional Bank stock fund for other institutional investors.    &quot;Way back, I used to be something of a business doctor,&quot; Mr. Hillas said, indicating that working to turn around an ailing firm won't be a new experience for him.    When Meritor went public in 1983, it was the largest thrift in the country. Mr. Hillas said he is hopeful that, &quot;with a little luck, we can turn it into the powerhouse it once was.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
