American Petrofina Inc., the Dallas-based oil company 85%-owned by the Belgian company Petrofina S.A., walked away as the surprise $600 million winning bidder for Tenneco's Gulf Coast oil and gas reserves.    The reserves purchase, which is the largest ever for American Petrofina, will more than double the company's hydrocarbon reserves by adding at least 28.4 million barrels of oil and 437 billion cubic feet of gas. It holds a profitable refining and chemical position already in the U.S.    &quot;We plan to be players in the exploration and production business in the U.S.,&quot; said Ron Haddock, a former Exxon Corp. executive who is American Petrofina's executive vice president and chief operating officer. &quot;At our current levels of production, we needed to grow.&quot;    American Petrofina's growth in exploration and production comes at a time when most major U.S. companies are increasing their exploration activities overseas, where costs are cheaper and it's generally believed more oil can be found.    But at the same time, units of foreign oil companies have been aggressively buying and drilling for oil in the U.S. In fact, Total Minatome Corp., the U.S. unit of a French oil company, triggered this year's binge of property sales by paying $612 million for the oil and gas unit of CSX Corp.    The premium paid by Total prompted Enron Corp. to put its oil and gas reserves on the market -- only to pull them off when it couldn't get a satisfactory price.    Elf Aquitaine Petroleum, the U.S. unit of another French oil company, was an aggressive bidder for oil leases in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska in partnership with the U.S. unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, an Anglo-Dutch concern.    These companies seek properties in the U.S. because of this country's political stability, relatively favorable tax conditions and access to strong consumer markets. But the foreign-controlled concerns can also have an identity problem.    &quot;We operate as an independent company,&quot; Kenneth Perry, American Petrofina's president and chief executive officer, said in a recent interview. &quot;We coordinate and keep in close touch with our respective people in Brussels,&quot; he said, but because American Petrofina's stock trades in the U.S., Mr. Perry considers his first duty to be protecting the interests of minority holders.    &quot;I sometimes have to stand up and take a pretty strong stand on things,&quot; he said. &quot;But I have never been overruled on anything related to&quot; protecting the minority holders, he said.    American Petrofina's stock, which is thinly traded because of its ownership, fell $1 to close at $69.25. </TEXT></DOC>
