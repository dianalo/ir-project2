A total of 634 grain workers were studied at the initial survey,of whom 239 satisfied the following inclusion criteria: (1) had a satisfactorychest radiograph taken at the initial survey in 1975, (2) performed spirometryat the 1975, 1978, and 1981 surveys, and (3) had no change in smokingstatus from 1975 to 1981. Radiographic measurements consisted of heightof the right lung, transverse diameter of the chest at the level of theright diaphragm and at a level two-thirds up the right lung, and trachealdiameter (Tr). Areas of both lungs were measured by planimetry. Tr wasonly weakly related to height (r = 0.24). Increasing age was stronglyassociated with faster rates of FEV1 decline. After adjusting for theeffects of age and cigarette smoking, Tr was the only radiographic measurementassociated with FEV1 decline. Workers with Tr of 16 mm or less lost anaverage of 0.2% of their FEV1 per year compared to 0.9% per year forthose with larger tracheas. This association was not modified by dustexposure estimates based on measurements of total dust. However, thestrength of the association did depend upon smoking status, being strongestin current cigarette smokers (Tr less than or equal to 16 mm lost 0.2%annually and Tr greater than or equal to 21 mm lost 1.4% annually).</TEXT></DOC>
