The South African Broadcasting Corp. reported that``verification patrols of the police and territory force units arenow being deployed in Ovambo'' in northern Namibia.   The troops had been confined to their bases since Wednesday togive South-West Africa People's Organization guerrillas time tofollow the orders of their commanders and retreat to Angola.   Neil van Heerden, South African foreign affairsdirector-general, said troops and paramilitary police have beenurged to exercise restraint. But he acknowledged that clashes couldoccur if guerrillas are found heading south, rather than northtoward Angola.   South Africa has agreed to end its 74-year control of theterritory under a a U.N. peace plan. But South Africa claimed theNamibian rebels, who have bases in Angola, violated the accord byentering Nambia on April 1.   Under the agreement, guerrillas were to stay at their basesoutside Namibia until mid-May, when they are to return as unarmedrefugees to participate in November elections provided for by theU.N. plan.   The South African forces were dispatched from their bases tofight the guerrilla incursion at that time and in the next twoweeks 305 guerrillas and 27 security force members were killed,according to the South Africans.   Van Heerden said Angola, Cuba and South Africa agreed earlierthis week to allow another two weeks to verify whether theguerrillas had left Namibia. He said if the South African-ledforces verify the guerrillas' departure by May 13, the peace planwould resume.   The three nations were the main parties in the U.N. accord thatalso calls for the withdrawal of Cuban troops aiding the Marxistgovernment in Angola against South African- and U.S.-backed rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
