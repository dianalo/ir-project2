SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal prosecutors expect to bring the firstindictments in the Pentagon fraud and bribery scandal just one weekafter the presidential election and may continue charging people forup to a year. They won't rule out congressmen as targets of theinvestigation.   Henry E. Hudson, the U.S. attorney in suburban Virginia who isrunning the multi-state, multi-agency investigation, is well awareof whispers that the Reagan administration wanted charges delayeduntil after Nov. 8 so that Democratic presidential nominee MichaelDukakis wouldn't have them as ammunition against George Bush.   ``Nothing would have given me greater pleasure than to hand downindictments in the first part of October,'' Hudson said in aninterview at week's end. Indeed, he and his bosses at the JusticeDepartment had predicted that kind of timetable last June when thescandal broke with FBI raids on 44 sites coast-to-coast.   But Hudson said complexity, not politics, pushed the time back.This is the largest case his office has ever handled. His attorneysand investigators have reviewed 700,000 documents and more are stillunder subpoena to be turned over. They've listened to ``thousandsand thousands of tapes of two years' of telephone interceptions.''   Prosecutors say the 2-year-old investigation into the $150billion-a-year Pentagon procurement system has turned up evidencethat consultants, including some former high-level Reaganadministration officials and former high-ranking military men,working for the nation's largest defense contractors bribed Pentagonofficials for information vital to winning contracts worth billionsof dollars. Five Pentagon employees have been transferred away fromcontract work.   Hudson's investigators have found foreign or offshore bankaccounts tied to some of the principals in the case, and he saidthey are seeking foreign bank records _ ``always (a) delicate issueand ... a time-consuming process.''   Also government and defense sources, who won't allow use of theirnames, indicate Hudson's men have been kept waiting for responsesfrom some potential defendants to offers of plea bargains.   Hudson is using 15 attorneys, including some from the JusticeDepartment's fraud and public integrity sections, and 75 federalagents, from the FBI, the Naval Investigative Service and theInternal Revenue Service. They've been working 10 and 12 hours aday, including weekends.   In addition, he said, the federal judges of eastern Virginia,known for moving cases quickly, impose a burden not found in otherfederal jurisdictions. ``The very day the indictment is handed down,our judges assume I am ready for trial, so ... I will not presentthis indictment until we are ready for trial.''   Now, Hudson said, ``I'm very optimistic on mid-Novemberindictments.'' Justice sources fix the date at Nov. 15, whichhappens to be next day the grand jury meets.   Hudson would only say that historically his office has keptindictments below a dozen defendants. Justice sources expect evenfewer than that in the first round _ perhaps half a dozenindividuals.   But Hudson conceded that charges against additional defendants``could very well expand (for) a year, sure.''   Hudson would not discuss the ownership or location of the foreignbank accounts nor would he say what charges were contemplated. Butthe presence of the IRS agents on his team indicates that taxcharges are being considered in addition to the more obvious countsof theft of government property, bribery, fraud, conspiracy todefraud the government.   Court papers filed in Brooklyn, N.Y., indicate the prosecutorsare looking at allegations that campaign contributions wereextorted. Raids in New York came at the business of James Kane, whoset up the Long Island Aerospace Political Action Committee to makecontributions that might help area defense contractors, and at theLong Island home of Dennis Mitchell, a Unisys Corp. officialidentified as turning over contributions to Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md.,who sits on the House Armed Services Committee. Dyson has denied anywrongdoing.   Dyson and several other congressmen were mentioned early in thecase, prompting Hudson to visit Capitol Hill. Members who attendedthe closed meeting emerged saying that no congressman was a targetof the investigation.   But ``I never made such a statement,'' Hudson said. ``I told themembers of the House of Representatives that no member of Congresshad been the subject of electronic surveillance, had received asubpoena to testify in front of the grand jury at that time or hadbeen the subject of a search warrant.''   In the last month, Hudson won full control of the case whenAssistant Attorney General Edward Dennis told U.S. Attorney AndrewMaloney in Brooklyn to step out of the case.   Hudson denies _ and Maloney will not discuss _ reports theyargued over what priority to put on going after congressmen. Maloneysaid, ``There were targets and players in both jurisdictions, but EdDennis just decided he wanted to keep central control in Virginia.''   Long Island also has been the site of alleged documentdestruction, according to federal court papers. FBI agents told ajudge they overheard Kane ordering his employees to dispose ofdocuments after the initial FBI raids. Hudson would not say whetherthat problem cropped up elsewhere.   Court papers in Brooklyn show the government granted someindividuals immunity for their testimony.   Hudson won't comment on the immunities or any plea bargainnegotiations. But one source said, ``They offered to let a guy inhis 60s plead guilty to a 20-year and a 15-year count. The lowestI've heard is a guy with next-to-no involvement who was offered afive-year sentence.''   ``That's why they aren't getting many accepted, because they'reoffering relatively hard deals.''   Defense sources said they believed at least one deal may havebeen agreed to, but federal sources would not confirm that.   Federal sources, acknowledging they had initially expected moretargets would seek deals, said some individuals had rejected offersof leniency in return for guilty pleas but others simply had not yetresponded to offers.   One federal investigator, noting that anyone who pleaded guiltynow might spend Christmas in prison not at home, said, ``Going tojail is like paying bills, if you can do it tomorrow instead oftoday, you do it tomorrow.''</TEXT></DOC>
