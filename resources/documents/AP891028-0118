STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of pro-democracy protesters took to thestreets in two East German cities on Saturday, keeping up pressureon the Communist government to adopt reforms.   About 30,000 reform activists protested in Plauen, the state-runnews agency ADN said. ADN said another 6,000 marched in Greiz.   ADN said marchers in both cities carried placards demanding freeelections, travel freedom and legalization of the pro-democracygroup New Forum.   According to ADN, many in the Plauen march shouted, ``Enoughtalk, we want action!''   In Greiz, ADN said many protesters carried posters showingSoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose reforms they support.   Also Saturday, East Germany's new Communist leadership hinted atfurther steps to decriminalize escape attempts to the West, a dayafter tens of thousands demonstrated in at least six other citiesacross the nation for pro-democracy reforms.   Meanwhile, there were indications several East German politicalparties allied with the ruling Communist Party are seeking greaterindependence.   Manfred Bogisch, a leader in East Germany's Liberal DemocraticParty, wrote in the party newspaper Der Morgen Saturday that a``multi-party system can only work when the political parties actand are true'' to their platforms.   West Germany's ZDF television network late Friday said it hadinformation that the Liberal Democrats and another Communist-alliedparty, the Christian Democrats, want to pull out of the NationalFront, the union of parties under Communist dominance.   According to ZDF, the two parties want to campaign for moreseats in Parliament based on vote totals and not on a quota systemset by the Communist Party.   The calls for greater political independence came one day afterthe Communist government announced important concessions and afterthousands took to the streets to demand reforms.   The demonstrations in Dresden, Karl-Marx-Stadt, Senftenberg,Saalfeld, Guestrow and Grossraeschen late Friday came despite agovernment decision to grant an amnesty for demonstrators, forpeople who have left the country illegally, and for thousands whowere jailed for trying to escape.   The amnesty was the the most dramatic move that Egon Krenz hastaken since he became Communist Party chief on Oct. 18, replacinghard-line leader Erich Honecker.   The government said people who remain in the West afterofficially permitted trips are finished will be able to return homelater without fear of prosecution.   The government also said it will restore free travel toCzechoslovakia as of Nov. 1. Restrictions were imposed Oct. 3 tostop a rush of East Germans to the West German Embassy in Prague,where they demanded to be allowed to go West.   Travel restrictions have been among the most bitter complaintsof East Germans. The new government has also promised to allow EastGermans greater travel freedoms to the West.   About 60,000 East Germans have gone to West Germany since Julyvia Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary.   By extending leniency to people who left the country illegally,the government clears the way for them to return without facingcriminal prosecution.   The amnesty covers incidents through Friday, and all prisonersincluded in the act will be released by Nov. 30, the governmentsaid. About 4,000 people are believed jailed for trying to fleeWest.   The country's prosecutor-general, Guenter Wendland, said futurelaws were still under discussion, ``but it is already quite certainthat the regulation to prosecute those who don't return fromallowed trips will not be in the amended law.''   Neues Deutschland, the Communist Party's official newspaper,hinted in a commentary Saturday that attempted escape might befurther decriminalized if violence or force was not a factor.   ``The amnesty and the new travel law that is being worked outwill require changes in the law relating to illegal flight,'' thenewspaper said.   A liberal travel law, coupled with a decision not to prosecutethose who leave and then decide to return, would largely eliminatethe need for daring escapes across the border.   The government said the amnesty also included people chargedwith taking part in illegal street protests during weeks of turmoil.</TEXT></DOC>
