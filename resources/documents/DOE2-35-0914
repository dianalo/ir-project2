There is evidence that alpha radiationfrom radon gas at exposure levels above 465 working level months (WLM)is a strong contributor to the development of lung cancer. Cigarettesmoking plays the most significant role in causing lung tumor; this isalso noticed in nonminers who smoke cigarettes. A synergistic or additiveeffect of these two carcinogens is strongly suggested. The data indicatethat small cell tumors develop in younger nonsmoking miners exposed toradon levels above 465 WLM. Lung cancers develop in smoking miners atlower levels of radon exposure than in nonsmoking miners. Based on anaverage mining experience of 15 years, there is substantial evidencethat the present maximum allowable limit of 0.3 working levels (WL),or 4 working level months (WLM) per year, is safe, representing a marginof safety of approximately 10:1. Furthermore, a comparison of these datawith the radon levels in some homes, averaging in the neighborhood of0.025 WL, would indicate that health risks at these levels are negligible.It is suggested that 20 picocuries/liter, which equals 0.10 WL, be themaximum allowable level in homes.</TEXT></DOC>
