WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jack Kemp ended his Republican presidentialcampaign Thursday, saying George Bush has won ``the Reagan wing ofthe Republican Party'' and hinting that he'd welcome the No. 2 spoton the ticket.   Kemp, whose campaign as the true conservative heir to RonaldReagan never caught on with voters, endorsed no candidate. He saidof his rivals, ``They're all Reagan conservatives.''   The New York congressman bowed out at a Capitol Hill newsconference, flanked by his family and some of the House members whobacked his candidacy. He evoked cheers from moist-eyed supporterswith a vow that ``No way'' would this be his last campaign for theWhite House.   Kemp, 51, said he would not seek re-election to the House seatfrom Buffalo that he has held for 18 years. He did not rule outrunning for the Senate from New York but said he had no plans to doso.   He called the notion that he might be asked to be the Republicanvice presidential candidate a ``very flattering and awesomethought.''   He said he didn't expect it but added, ``Would I think about it?The answer to that is yes.''   Kemp entered the presidential race in April 1987 after years ofpreparation to position himself as the candidate of the Republicanright wing.   But his campaign never caught on with Republican voters, and heconsistently finished behind Bush, Bob Dole and former televisionevangelist Pat Robertson in the GOP primaries.   Less than three weeks ago in a debate with his rivals, Kempdeclared that the nomination of Bush or Dole would signal the deathof the ``Reagan revolution'' of conservatism. But in withdrawing,Kemp said that Bush had won Reagan's Republican constituency.   ``We were competing for the Reagan wing of the Republican Party,and he won,'' Kemp said.   ``It's very clear that George Bush ran on the Reagan agenda. AndI think that the vote for George Bush, with all due respect, todayis a vote'' for Ronald Reagan, Kemp said.   ``It's simply to recognize that I was running against RonaldReagan. And that's a surprise because I am his strongest proponent,at least in terms of the ideals that were launched back in 1980.''   Kemp spoke by telephone with Bush and the other GOP candidatesWednesday night. Bush chief of staff Craig Fuller, with the vicepresident, said Bush's ``respect for the congressman has grown overthe course of the campaign.''   Kemp never was able to coalesce around his candidacy even theconservative movement within the Republican Party that he claimedto lead.   Some conservative leaders said that while they would like to seeKemp on the ticket, they doubted he had displayed enough politicaldrawing power to be asked to join it.   Robertson said, ``With Jack Kemp's withdrawal today, I am moreand more being urged by conservatives to stay in the race as arallying point for conservatives and conservative principles.''   ``Portions of the 3 or 4 percent he's been getting should comeover to me,'' Robertson said.   Kemp's best showing in the primaries was 13 percent of the votein New Hampshire. On Tuesday in 17 GOP contests, the best he scoredwas a dismal 7 percent in Massachusetts.   Kemp won just four delegates from 712 at stake in Super Tuesdaycontests. Kemp had 35 committed delegates _ but most of those werehanded to him by Bush in a Michigan compromise designed to preventRobertson from claiming a victory.   Daniel L. Casey, executive director of the American ConservativeUnion, said that with Kemp gone from the race, many conservativeRepublicans could be expected to focus their efforts on trying toshape the Republican Party platform. Beyond that, he said, they maypush for a conservative running mate and turn attention tocongressional and other local races.   ``It remains to be seen whether or not the leadership inWashington of the conservative movement will establish a workingrelationship with the Bush campaign,'' said Casey.   Campaign spokesman John Buckley said Kemp spent $15 million onhis effort, and departs with debts of less than $100,000.   ``We balanced our budget,'' Kemp said.</TEXT></DOC>
