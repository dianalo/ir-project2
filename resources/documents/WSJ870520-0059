The U.S. reached an accord with South Korea last year that grants increased access to the Korean insurance market, which generates annual premiums of about $5 billion. Last summer, Seoul allowed the first U.S. life-insurance firm to enter its market.    But instead of choosing AIG, which for 15 years had led U.S. pressure to open the market, Korea picked a Cigna Corp. unit, Life Insurance Co. of North America. AIG had charged that it was being singled out for punishment for leading the liberalization effort. Korea, however, had denied that it had discriminated against AIG.    Yesterday, Korea announced that it was granting access to AIG's American Life Insurance Co. In New York, AIG confirmed that the decision had been made.    Korean government officials said American Life is supposed to open within six months a branch in Seoul that has an operational fund equivalent to $6 million.    Gaining access to the insurance market is one part of the U.S. push for Korea to open its markets. The lack of market access and South Korea's growing trade surplus with the U.S. has heightened tensions between the two nations.    In the first four months of this year, South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. grew about 44%, to $2.6 billion from $1.81 billion a year earlier, the Korean Traders Association reported yesterday.    Cars, electronics and textiles led Korean shipments to the U.S., which takes about 40% of the country's exports. Some economists say the surplus could exceed $9 billion this year, although Seoul, seeking to avert protectionist measures by the U.S., is committed to holding the surplus to last year's level of about $7 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
