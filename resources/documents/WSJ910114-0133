In California, a fledgling biotech company chooses not toincorporate a brilliant new assay technique (to determine thecomposition of materials) in its instrument because it mightbe seen as competitive with the offerings of its giantpharmaceutical-house investor.</LP><TEXT>   These firms are seriously ill. They're afflicted with NIH(Not-Invented-Here) Syndrome -- a disease that leadsorganizations to treat external innovation as a strategicnuisance rather than as a competitive opportunity. Thesecompanies have become innovation protectionists: They preferto shelter their domestic ideas and fail to appreciate thevalue of importing new ideas and techniques.   &quot;This syndrome is endemic to most American and Europeanengineers,&quot; notes C. Gordon Bell, one of the country's topcomputer architects. &quot;The effects on productivity and Pandamp;L aredevastating. The NIH syndrome may account for why Japaneseengineers are at least twice as productive as Americanengineers in a field such as automotive engineering.&quot;   &quot;Very few companies have managers who take personalresponsibility for bringing new technology in from theoutside,&quot; asserts Michael Odza, publisher of TechnologyAccess Report, a newsletter specializing intechnology-transfer issues. &quot;The natural pressure is to favorone's own children inside,&quot; he says.   Part of the problem is that most American companies haveforgotten where innovation really comes from. From the timeSamuel Slater slipped into Rhode Island from the BritishIsles in 1789 with the plans for textile mills in his head,Yankee ingenuity has had a foreign accent. America's chemicaland medical research prowess was initially inspired byEuropean efforts. The Manhattan Project and the space programalso depended on the cross-cultural flow of innovation.   Indeed, the history of innovation is the history ofcultures adopting and adapting each other's technologies.Japanese industry offers a superb example of a cultureunashamedly willing to exploit the innovations of others.Historian Arnold Pacey calls this process the &quot;technologydialogue.&quot; NIH companies prefer to deliver technologysoliloquies.   It's easy to say that companies should become more open.However, NIH can't be cured by touchie-feelie exercises inattitude engineering. Organizations have to build structuresthat explicitly encourage assimilating external technologies.   Some already have, to great success. &quot;The pharmaceuticalindustry is well accustomed to looking outside,&quot; says Mr.Odza. &quot;That's a significant key to their success. Thoseefforts don't take anything away from what they developinternally.&quot; Indeed, the pharmaceutical industry has atradition of research collaboration with academe going backto the turn of the century. The high cost of drug researchand the rapid changes in biotechnology have tightened thosebonds.   Much of Japan's research, development and innovationinfrastructures are designed around the task of developingtechnology transfer -- precisely because Japanese industrylacked an internal research capability for years. It is thisability to quickly identify, absorb, adapt and create newproducts from external ideas -- as much as cost of capital ormanufacturing capability -- that has given Japan itsinnovative edge.   Most Western companies, however, are a little too proud oftheir own technical prowess. &quot;If you're at a company whereyou only get credit if you're the one who did all the work,then there's really no incentive to look outside, &quot; says LitaNelson, the associate director of the Technology LicensingOffice at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &quot;Peopleneed to be rewarded for bringing the right technologiesin-house.&quot;   That seldom happens. In fact, Ms. Nelson observes, &quot;Thebiggest surprise to me is that we do most of our licensing tosmall companies; it's not because we don't offer it to largecompanies&quot; but because large companies aren't designed tosuccessfully integrate embryonic technologies. The structuresaren't in place.   Create them. Companies should do more than hire a few&quot;technology talent scouts&quot;; they need to createorganizational parity between internal and externaldevelopment. &quot;G.D. Searle is an example of a company that hasbifurcated, and it seems to be working well for them,&quot; saysMr. Odza. &quot;Both departments understand that the goal is tobring in a new product at a reasonable cost.&quot; Nearly half ofSearle's revenues come from products that were not discoveredin-house. In fact, Calan, one of the company's mostprofitable hypertension drugs, is licensed from Germany.   Companies should also consider a &quot;tax&quot; on internalresearch and development projects: Set aside 10% to 15% ofthe funding to acquire external technologies, such aslicenses, university relationships and outsider expertise.Top management should insist that all innovation developmentreviews include a discussion of how a new product or servicemight be assembled from external sources.   In essence, the organization has to build a newself-consciousness -- and self-discipline -- aboutinnovation. The purpose is not to minimize the importance ofinternal efforts; it's to make sure that, when appropriate,external ideas can become the springboards to internaldevelopment.   As Randamp;D budgets are tightening and global competitivenessis intensifying, it's understandable that an organization'sfirst instinct is to hunker down. But, as the evolution ofinnovation clearly shows, that's precisely the time thatorganizations need to open up.   ---   Mr. Schrage is the author of &quot;Shared Minds: The NewTechnologies of Collaboration&quot; (Random House, 1990).</TEXT></DOC>
