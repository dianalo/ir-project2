The change of heart reflects a growing recognition among MCI executives that the Washington-based telecommunications concern will have trouble withstanding several more rounds of drastic price cuts. Over the past two years, MCI has seen its profit crushed by industrywide price cuts prompted by the Federal Communications Commission's regulation of ATandamp;T.    MCI, which got its start by suing ATandamp;T, has insisted publicly that giving ATandamp;T more freedom to set its own prices for its services would be premature. But now, MCI officials believe that giving ATandamp;T more flexibility might stem the tide of price cuts. Indeed, ATandamp;T executives have said that under deregulation they may not have to fully reflect cost reductions in price cuts.    MCI's change in thinking also is significant because it could pave the way for the FCC to loosen its grip on the regulation of ATandamp;T. &quot;Clearly what's restraining the commission more than anything else now is fear of repercussions from Congress,&quot; said Harry Shooshan, a telecommunications consultant in Washington. &quot;But if MCI were to indicate that it has rethought its position, it could change the equation.&quot;    Dennis Patrick, an FCC commissioner who is expected to succeed Mark Fowler as chairman this spring, already has said the agency should consider scrapping its current approach, in favor of giving ATandamp;T more flexibility by setting a ceiling on the prices it can charge customers. The agency currently dictates the company's profit margin on long-distance service.    In the past, MCI has objected to giving ATandamp;T more freedom to set its own prices, arguing that the company has continued to dominate the long-distance industry with roughly an 80% market share.    But in recent months, with its profit margins under pressure, MCI has been reexamining that view. While MCI executives still consider ATandamp;T a powerful force, one MCI insider said, &quot;It may be in our own self-interest to support their deregulation.&quot;    Giving ATandamp;T more freedom to set its prices, based on market conditions, &quot;would make the industry more orderly,&quot; the MCI insider said. &quot;We think the commission is doing more to mess up the industry than ATandamp;T would given their own free rein.&quot;    ATandamp;T's prices currently are determined largely by the rate of return the FCC sets. The company has slashed its rates about 30% over the past three years, in response to FCC actions.    The result has been several waves of industrywide price cuts that have bloodied MCI and other long-distance companies. In 1986, MCI had a loss of $448.4 million, compared with net income of $113.3 million, or 48 cents a share, the year earlier. US Sprint Communications Co., a Kansas City, Mo., joint venture between GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc., also has been posting huge losses.    ATandamp;T also is having problems. Largely because of restructuring charges, the company earned a slim $139 million, or five cents a share, on revenue of $34.09 billion in 1986.    The year earlier, the company had net of $1.55 billion, or $1.37 a share, on revenue of $34.4 billion. And ATandamp;T officials are generally gloomy about the outlook for 1987. They also are aggressively lobbying the FCC to free the company from rate-of-return-based regulation that limits its earnings for long-distance service.    MCI officials and some analysts believe that had ATandamp;T been given the choice, it wouldn't have cut rates as much as it has.    Indeed, MCI President Bert C. Roberts Jr. recently told a few participants at a securities analysts meeting in New York that he would rather &quot;cast the company's fate to compete with ATandamp;T, no matter how rough they are going to be, than to compete with Mark Fowler, which is what we have been doing for the last two years.&quot;    The situation is particularly frustrating for MCI executives, who believe that without so many price cuts, their own company would have met most of the objectives it set for itself three years ago when the Bell System was dismantled.    At an industry conference last week, the ATandamp;T executive in charge of the company's relations with regulators said that if ATandamp;T was freed from rate-of-return regulation, it would refrain from cutting rates to the same extent that its costs to connect to local companies are reduced. Most of ATandamp;T's rate cuts since divestiture have occurred because the FCC has required it to cut rates to fully reflect reductions in connection costs.    Keeping some of those cost reductions for itself would give ATandamp;T's profit a sorely needed boost. Though its long-distance operations have been very profitable, its overall earnings have been hurt by huge losses from operations that sell phone and computer equipment to consumers and businesses.    Because some deregulation probably would reduce pressure on ATandamp;T to cut rates, ATandamp;T has long expressed puzzlement over MCI's opposition to lifting rate-of-return regulation. As the leading long-distance company, ATandamp;T's rates set a price ceiling for the industry. As ATandamp;T rates have come down, it has forced the rates of its competitors down, thus hurting practically every company's profits.    &quot;The story being told about (the period following the breakup of the Bell System) is being told wrong,&quot; one MCI executive said. &quot;What has happened is that the people who are competing in this business have been stripped of all their profits by the regulatory fervor&quot; that MCI officials believe has favored the local phone companies that were spun off from ATandamp;T.    MCI isn't likely to call for total deregulation of ATandamp;T, however. One fear, according to the company insider, is that an unfettered ATandamp;T might price its services below cost as a way to win customers. </TEXT></DOC>
