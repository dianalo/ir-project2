This rule provides for the replacement of the current formswith Optical Character Recognition (OCR) forms. The OCR forms allow thedirect recording of export license information into the Commerce Departmentcomputer data base, thus, eliminating the need for manual entry as requiredunder the current forms. Use of the OCR forms on a voluntary basis hasproved successful. The OCR forms will result in significant cost savingsand in streamline processing of license applications. Furthermore, useof the OCR forms will incur no added expense for U.S. business. In addition,this rule provides that the OCR forms are revised to carry the ``BXA''designation (<T3>e.g.,</T3> BXA-622P) in order to reflect the establishment of the Bureauof Export Administration as a separate entity from the International TradeAdministration within the U.S. Department of Commerce. The current forms,which carry the ``ITA'' designation, will be acceptable for use until February15, 1989. After that date, only the OCR compatible forms, which carry the``BXA'' designation, will be accepted by BXA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>February 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Tom deButts, Office of ExportLicensing, Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone: (202) 377-4811.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. This rule complies with Executive Order 12291 and Executive Order 12661.2. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, and opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule also is exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruledoes not impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that a noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule.3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministration Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.4. This rule contains a collection of information requirement under thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>.). These collections have been approved by the Office ofManagement and Budget under control numbers 0694-0005, 0694-0007, and 0694-0010.The public reporting burden for BXA Form 622P is estimated to average forty-fiveminutes per response, BXA Form 685P is estimated to average fifteen minutesper response, and BXA Form 699P is estimated to average twenty-five minutesper response. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any otheraspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducingthis burden, to the Office of Administration, Bureau of Export Administration,Room 3889, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230 and to the Officeof Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,Washington, DC 20503.5. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.Accordingly, it is being issued in final form. However, as with other Departmentof Commerce rules, comments from the public are always welcome.
