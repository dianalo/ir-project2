U.S. paper and paperboard production capacity grew about3% this year to 84.4 million short tons, but the capacitygrowth rate will average only 1.9% from 1992 to 1994, theAmerican Paper Institute said in its annual survey ofcapacity.</LP><TEXT>   Specifically, the survey expects the industry to add about4.9 million tons of paper and paperboard capacity in the nextthree years to reach 91.9 million tons in 1994. Annualprojected increases are 2.3% in 1992, 1.8% in 1993 and 1.4%in 1994. Capacity growth averaged 2.5% from 1981 through1991.   &quot;Increasingly, sustained uncertain economic prospects areresulting in delays and stretch-outs of expansions,&quot; said RedCavaney, president of the pulp and paper industry tradegroup.   Capacity plans for wood pulp are similar to those forpaper and paperboard. The average annual growth 1992 through1994 is expected to be 1.2% vs. an average of 2% from 1981 to1991. This year, capacity -- the maximum practical limit toproduction -- is expected to rise 2.2%, and grow 2.4% in 1992as existing projects come into operation. Then the capacitygrowth rate is expected to fall to a 0.7% average for 1993and 1994.   The institute cited statistics showing greater industryspending on pollution abatement, totaling an estimated $1.4billion this year after $1.3 billion in 1990. From 1980 to1989 the industry spent a total of $4.1 billion on pollutioncontrol.   &quot;Measured as a percentage of sales, the paper industry isthe most capital intensive in the U.S. -- twice as capitalintensive as the all-manufacturing average -- with $100,000of plant and equipment investment to support each and everypaper industry employee,&quot; Mr. Cavaney said.   Richard Storat, the institute's vice president foreconomic and financial services, said that for the first timein several years, additions to capacity from &quot;rebuilds ofmachines and from other improvements to manufacturingfacilities&quot; will exceed expansion from installation of newpaper machines. Only nine new machines will come on line inthe next three years, compared with 28 in the 1989-91 period.   The survey respondents produce more than 90% of U.S.paper, paperboard and wood pulp.   Mr. Cavaney also updated the industry's recycling efforts.He said recycled paper will provide more than 30% of the rawmaterial for the manufacture of paper and paperboard in theU.S. in 1994 vs. just under 28% this year.   &quot;The industry is on track to achieve its national goal ofrecovering, for recycling domestically and abroad, 40% of allpaper consumed in the U.S. in 1995,&quot; Mr. Cavaney said. &quot;Useof recovered paper in U.S. paper mills is now expected togrow at a 6.8% annual rate&quot; through 1994, twice the rate ofincrease expected for overall fiber consumption, he said.   About 22 million tons of recovered paper went into themanufacture of paper products last year. The total isexpected to reach 28.7 million tons in 1994.   Such an increase in recycled paper use will &quot;require amajor increase in municipal and private collection programs,&quot;the institute said.   While newsprint production capacity growth is expected toslow sharply starting next year, the focus will remain onusing more old newspapers as a fiber source.   Mr. Storat noted that domestic recycling accounts for morethan 80% of the total amount of paper recovered in the U.S.each year; a substantial amount -- 6.5 million tons in 1990-- is exported and some is used to such products outside thepaper and paperboard industry as animal bedding, mulch andinsulation.</TEXT></DOC>
