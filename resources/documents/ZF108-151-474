software libraries with a range of vector and signalprocessing functions enable user programs written in high level language andrunning on the Transputer to call vector routines which are excecuted on theco-processor; price for the board is $5,800, including the software.andM;- o -andM;Aldus Corp, Seattle now has definitive agreement for its proposed acquisitionof Silicon Beach Software, San Diego: the total number of Aldus shares to beexchanged in the merger will be decided in about four weeks, and SiliconBeach will become a wholly owned subsidiary;

drawing size is limitedonly by the available disk space and the length of roll of the media, whichranges from opaque, vellum, translucent and clear and matt black films.andM;- o -andM;No doubt encouraged by the absorption of its parent company Istel by ATandamp;T,the Trent Regional Health Authority has signed a #5m per annum deal withIstel Health to take over the running of its Sheffield Data Centre: Trent isthe first regional health authority to subcontract its computer processing,but given the eagerness of data processing firms to get into facilities7management nowadays, it is very unlikely to be the last.andM;- o -andM;Siemens Information Systems Inc, Boca Raton, Florida has introduced an80486-based OEM AT-bus board, based on the Mnchener's slot-CPU concept whicheliminates the motherboard by using surface-mount tech-nology to fit theprocessor, memory, serial and parallel ports and disk controllers onto asingle board, with video controllers added via a daughterboard that mountsonto the slot-CPU board: it has 25MHz 80486 microprocessor with embedded80387 co-processor, 1Mb memory expandable to 32Mb, and 8Kb cache; the companygave no prices.andM;- o -andM;There has clearly been a long-running battle within IBM about how to positionthe new RISC System/6000 Unix machines, and the same faction that won the daywith the RT seems to have come out on top again: all the current noisescoming out of the US now are repeating the line that these machines areintended specifically for scientific and engineering applications and not forgeneral business - in Europe, that will make no difference, and they will beenthusiastically sold for business anyway - but it raises the questionwhether IBM has deliberately underpowered the terminal handling in themachines to reduce their performance in transaction-intensive applications,something easy enough to do with RISC as Hewlett-Packard Co found to itschagrin with the original Spectrums, which ran like a dream on compute-boundMPE/V applications but ground to a halt when people started asking them lotsof simple questions; a pointer that IBM does plan to support large numbers ofusers on the RS/6000s is that pricing for the Alis office software underAIX-RT and AIX/PS2 goes right up to 96 users, and neither of those has aprayer of handling that many users.andM;- o -andM;DEC's &quot;first&quot; fault-tolerant VAX will be launched in Paris on February 27,hears Computerworld, along with a new version - 5.4 - of DEC's proprietaryVMS operating system environment: the paper says that an entry-level CirrusOne - described as &quot;two MicroVAX 3 00s bolted together&quot;, will cost from$230,000, and will feature DEC's DSSI bus and 32Mb memory on each processor;the announcement may also provide some clues on the progress of DEC's effortsto produce a Posix-compliant version of VMS, the paper said - why France?andO;Well the paper seems to have forgotten, but DEC already has a fault-tolerantversion of the MicroVAX II, consisting of two CPUs in a single box linked viaEthernet, with a software switch so that if a malfunction is detected in theactive processor, its switches to the standby - called Mira, it was designedby DEC France (CI No 686).andM;- o -andM;CMG-Computer Management Group Ltd is getting thoroughly acquisitive, and itslatest buy is Dore BV, an Almera, Netherlands payroll and computer servicesbureau that set CMG back #625,000;
