Imre Pozsgay, who is also minister of state in the Communistgovernment, spoke hours before the policy-setting party CentralCommittee was to name a new premier to succeed party leader KarolyGrosz. Parliament still has to approve the candidate when it meetsin session Thursday.   The new premier will face a difficult task over the next twoyears, presiding over extensive economic and political reforms.   Before elections in 1990, when a new constitution is due to beadopted, Parliament is to pass a series of laws designed tointroduce market forces into the economy and to restructurepolitical institutions. This may pave the way for a multipartysystem.   Pozsgay, a leading reformer brought to the Politburo when Grosztook over as party leader in May, told a news conference today, ``Ipersonally see no obstacles in principle to the existence of amultiparty system.''   ``There has developed a genuine need (for pluralism), also amovement on the part of society itself that is unstoppable,'' hesaid.   ``It would destabilize the country and lead to a potentialcatastrophe if (the leadership) tried to stall this effort,'' hesaid.   In December, Parliament is due to adopt legislation regulatingthe establishment of independent groups, associations and unions.The new laws accept a multiparty system in principle. However,government leaders say further legislation is necessary to determinethe establishment and function of parties. Those laws are notexpected before 1990.   Dozens of independent groups and movements have sprung up overthe past year, many with highly political platforms. Until lastweek, however, none had gone so far as to declare themselves a party.   On Friday, the independent Smallholders' Party, which headed acoalition government before the Communists assumed power in 1948,announced that it was resuming its activites. Hungarian news mediagave no publicity to the move, in sharp contrast with its new policyof openness.   Pozsgay said the government would not exert repressive measuresagainst the new party. But he added that until the legal frameworkfor the establishment of parties has been created, the governmentwould not provide publicity for it.   Pozsgay is to present to Parliament what he called thegovernment's ``package plan for democracy,'' a report on reformingthe system of political institutions.   ``The model of socialism as applied until now was noteffective,'' Pozsgay said. It was ``an impediment to social progressand economic growth.'' Hungary must find a way to become a``Socialist country with pluralism,'' he said.   Reform legislation now being considered includes the laws onassembly and association to be passed in December and laws on pressfreedom, the right to strike and electoral reform, he said.   Pozsgay said Hungary's 10.6 million citizens should be given adirect voice in decision making, possibly through referendum. Thepowers of the judiciary also should be strengthened by establishingconstitutional courts, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
