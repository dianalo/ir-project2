The General Accounting Office told the House JudiciaryCommittee's criminal justice subcommittee that it had examined 26insolvent thrift insitutions in eight states and found evidence offraud or abusive insider dealing in each.   While the survey was skewed to Sandamp;Ls with the worst problems _ the26 represented 60 percent of total losses sustained by thegovernment's insurance fund from 1985 through 1987 _ the pattern offraud and abuse among all failed thrifts ``clearly is pervasive,''GAO officials said.   ``The huge losses which will ultimately be passed to the nation'staxpayers,'' estimated at $100 billion to $150 billion, ``did notcome about primarily because of economic conditions orderegulation,'' Assistant GAO Comptroller General Frederick Wolftold the subcommittee.   ``The bulk of the losses are directly attributable to the failureby management of a minority of the industry to follow basic, prudentbusiness practices, including the establishment of effective systemsof internal control,'' Wolf said.   Asked if that is a crime, Wolf said violation of fiduciaryresponsibilites to operate in a sound manner is clearly a criminalissue.   The GAO said it found inadequate records and controls at all 26of the failed thrifts it examined in detail, excessive loans to oneborrower at 23 of them, conflicts of interest among officers ordirectors at 20 and excessive salaries and benefits at 17.   The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.,complained that of the 11,000 Sandamp;L cases the Federal Home Loan BankBoard has referred to the Justice Department in the last two yearsfor criminal prosecution, less than 200 have resulted in convictions.   ``Ten billion dollars would go a long way to housing thehomeless, feeding the poor, educating the public, caring for thesick,'' Schumer said. ``Instead it has been wasted on lavish partiesjets, real estate, travel and meals at the expense of taxpayers.''   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh last month blamed fraud andinsider abuses for 25 percent to 30 percent of the Sandamp;L failures.Industry regulators said they have found the crimes a ``factor'' inat least 70 percent of insolvent institutions.   Of the 26 failed thrifts examined by the GAO, the bank board hadreferred 19 of them and allegations against 182 people to theJustice Department for suspected violations of criminal conspiracy,theft, fraud and embezzlement statutes.   As of this month, Wolf said, 23 of those people had beenconvicted _ at least 11 after pleading guilty _ and 19 more wereunder indictment. Two people were acquitted in trials.   Of those convicted, 15 were sentenced to prision, but thesentences ``generally were suspended with probation,'' Wolf said.   The GAO did not name the 26 Sandamp;Ls it examined, saying some of themare still open, or the individuals whose names had been referred tothe Justice Department for criminal investigation.   ``We are prohibited by law from disclosing the names of openbanks we review and, as a matter of long-standing policy, we treatthrifts in the same manner,'' Wolf said.   He said the GAO also is ``sensitive to the effect suchdisclosures could have on the government's effort to seek recoveriesin civil suits or to prosecute alleged criminal acts.''   At a separate hearing, Federal Reserve Board Chairman AlanGreenspan said his agency is working closely with the TreasuryDepartment to develop a detailed plan for handling the billions ofdollars in real estate the government will inherit from failed Sandamp;Ls.   Greenspan, who would be a member of the oversight board of thegovernment entity set up to dispose of the real estate, declined toprovide details of the plan to a House Banking subcommittee.   Some members of Congress are worried that government ``dumping''of Sandamp;L property at ``firesale'' prices will ruin regional realestate markets, particularly in the Southwest.   Treasury and White House officials are considering a proposaldeveloped by R.T. McNamar, a California investment banker and aformer deputy Treasury secretary, that would spend state and federalfunds to pay for holding onto foreclosed real estate for as long as10 or 15 years.</TEXT></DOC>
