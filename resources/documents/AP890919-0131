Human rights activist Jean-Claude Bajeux immediately denouncedthe move, saying: ``The commutation is a gesture of conciliationtoward the Duvalierists. The next step is a full pardon.''   ``Luc Desir, the man who directed torture sessions with a Biblein his hand, is a symbol of Duvalierist barbarity,'' Bajeux said inan interview.   L'Union newspaper carried an Information Ministry statementsaying that on the first anniversary of his rise to power on Sept.17, 1988, the president, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, pardoned orcommuted the sentences of 13 people.   They included Desir, who was sentenced to life at hard laborafter the fall of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986. Desir'ssentence was commuted to 30 years in prison, the InformationMinistry statement said.   ``The president of the republic has the prerogative to commute asentence. If he so wishes, he may even grant full pardon,'' MaxKernizan, the secretary of the Port-au-Prince Bar Association, toldThe Associated Press.   Kernizan said Desir's trial had been irregular and that he was``a victim of social pressure.'' Kernizan said Desir's ``victimscould not testify against him, since most of them are dead.''   One of the few people to be sentenced for crimes committed underthe dictatorship, Desir directed innumerable torture sessions andexecutions when he headed the dreaded secret police of FrancoisDuvalier, Jean-Claude's father. The number of his victims is notknown, but they are estimated in the hundreds.   In the 1970s Desir fell out of favor with Jean-Claude Duvalierand was forced into retirement. He was captured while trying to fleethe country on Feb. 25, 1988. An airport employee alerted a localradio station of his flight, and thousands of Haitians swarmed thelanding strip to prevent his departure.   Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier was elected president in 1957following a year of political turmoil during which six differentgovernments held power.   He became president-for-life in 1964 and wielded absolutepolitical control until his death in 1971, when his son, Jean-Claude``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, assumed the presidency. On Feb. 7, 1986,after months of civil disorder, Jean-Claude fled to exile in France.   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy led the military junta that assumed powerwhen Duvalier fled. Presidential elections on Nov. 29, 1987, wereaborted after thugs, protected by soldiers, massacred at least 34voters at polling stations.   Civilian Leslie Manigat won army-run elections on Jan. 17, 1988,and was overthrown by Namphy on June 20, 1988.   On Sept. 17, 1988, a military coup brought Avril to power.   In April 1989, loyalist troops foiled a coup attempt and crusheda rebellion by two army units.
