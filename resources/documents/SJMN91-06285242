To keep everyone involved, Coach Terry Sheasends in plays by alternating receivers at one spot, alternates receiversevery two downs at the other spot and has seven groups of substitutes oncall.;   &quot;It keeps our sideline very alert,&quot; Shea said. &quot;And when you knowyou're going to get into the game, you practice harder.&quot;;   The result hasbeen 1,216 passing yards in four games and five receivers with at least 10receptions.;   'The Young Guns'; Credit each of the receivers -- BobbyBlackmon, Gary Charlton, David Blakes, Walter Brooks Jr. and Byron Jackson --with the maturity to realize that 10 hands can be better than two. The unitywas forged a year ago, Brooks said, when they decided to market themselves asa unit and became &quot;The Young Guns.&quot;;   &quot;Each player can do something that theothers can't, but no one really outdoes the other,&quot; Brooks said.;   Thatversatility, combined with Shea's substitution system, poses problems for adefense trying to match personnel. Throw in Shea's use of both of hisquarterbacks, Matt Veatch and Jeff Garcia, and the variables seem endless.&quot;You don't want to blitz, because you could leave one of those guys open andtheir quarterback will find him,&quot; Gadd said. &quot;And their substitution patternsare so varied that you can wind up with linebackers matched againstwideouts.&quot;;   Confusion in numbers; Shea said he also has all of the widereceivers and tight ends wear uniform numbers in the 80s to add to theconfusion. &quot;It makes you wait a little longer to get your defensive signalsin,&quot; Bleil said.;   Shea also adds a new play every practice as one more wayof keeping his team in tune.;   There are glitches. Brooks and Jackson, whoalternate as play messengers, occasionally forget which one of them issupposed to go in next during a long drive by the other team. Their solution?;  &quot;We'll play paper-scissors-rock to decide,&quot; Jackson said.;   Imagine aspying defensive coordinator trying to make sense of that.; ETC.: TravisPeterson will replace suspended right guard Alten Faletoi when San Jose Stateplays at New Mexico State on Saturday. Faletoi was suspended indefinitelyafter an altercation Friday in a San Jose nightclub.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RIC BUCHER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911011  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DIAGRAM  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  457  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, October 11, 199100285242,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
