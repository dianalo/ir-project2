At a closed session of an emergency congress, more than 2,700delegates decided to change the party's official name from theSocialist Unity Party of Germany to the Socialist Unity Party ofGermany-Party of Democratic Socialism.   The congress also was expected to adopt a more democraticplatform before it completes its session on Sunday.   The Communists have been under increasing pressure from massdemonstrations demanding democratic reforms and in the past twomonths have ousted hard-line leaders, opened borders and promisedfree elections.   The Communists will face challenges when parliamentary electionsare held May 6, and one smaller political party and an oppositiongroup also met Saturday to discuss their goals and strategy forattracting support.   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe on Saturday:   _ Czechoslovakia's opposition movement demanded immediatepresidential elections be held by Parliament, suggesting theleading contenders _ Alexander Dubcek and opposition leader VaclavHavel _ had reached an accord on who should have the post. Ex-partyleader Dubcek's ``Prague Spring'' reforms were crushed by aSoviet-led invasion in 1968.   Havel offered another indication that an arrangement had beenreached when he said later he would serve as president only ifDubcek is given a top role in the government.   _ Several thousand protesters in Sofia, Bulgaria, demanded anofficial funeral service for the victims of Stalinist purges,including a Communist Party chief who was hanged after a show trial40 years ago.   _ Solidarity leader Lech Walesa led a group of about 1,000people in Gdansk, Poland, in marking the anniversary of the killingof scores of Baltic Coast workers by Communist security forcesduring food riots in December 1970.   _ In a related development, President Bush said the UnitedStates would be ``very responsive'' to any request from EastGermany for emergency wintertime food aid. He made the comment at ajoint news conference with French President Francois Mitterrandfollowing their brief summit conference on the Caribbean island ofSt. Martin.   The East German Communist congress gave party leader Gregor Gysia standing ovation when he announced the party's new name.   ``We want to be a party that is thoroughly reformed ... andtherefore a new name,'' Communist Premier Hans Modrow toldreporters.   The delegates also burst into thunderous applause when MichaelSchumann, addressing a party report on corruption, accused oustedhard-line leader Erich Honecker of ignoring public desire forreform.   The ailing Honecker, in a letter sent to the party leadershipnearly a month ago and released to the delegates Saturday, concededhe had ``deceived'' himself about the state of the economy and themood of the people. But he rejected widespread accusations that hewas corrupt.   The corruption report blamed Honecker, 77, and former economicschief Guenter Mittag for what it called political and economicerrors that led to the successful pro-democracy movement and thedecline of Communist power.   The party has given up its constitutional mandate to rule, andmore than 700,000 members have quit in recent weeks, droppingmembership to about 1.6 million.   Honecker had to be replaced as party leader, the report said, toprevent ``a civil war-like bloody conflict'' with pro-democracyactivists.   It said the party should carry no ``collective guilt'' forwrongdoing by disgraced former leaders, but criticized members forfailing to stand up to the corrupt party hierarchy.   Honecker has been in seclusion since he was stripped of hisparty leadership posts on Oct. 18. He was expelled from the partyon Dec. 3 for suspected corruption and put under house arrest twodays later.   Kurt Hager, the former party ideologist, told reporters at thecongress he ``felt guilty,'' but that the errors of the past were a``collective responsbility.''   Honecker is ``very sick, but it's another question about what isgoing to happen to him. ... The party leadership will be judged,but you have to prove the guilt of individuals,'' Hager said.   A guest at the congress was Rudolf Bahro was a former partymember arrested for his critical views of orthodox communism andexpelled to West Germany in the 1970s. He recently returned to EastGermany.   Bahro, a 54-year-old intellectual, told reporters that theCommunist Party's reform effort was ``half-hearted,'' and that theparty must establish new ties to the population to gain support.   Several speakers said the party would have to start its campaignearly if it were to have a chance in the May elections.   Meanwhile, the Christian Democratic Union, one of the smallpolitical parties formerly aligned with the Communists, completedits own congress Saturday and elected reformer Lothar de Maiziere,49, to lead it.   The party plans to emphasize its religious roots to gain supportfrom East Germans, the majority of whom are believers.   Democratic Awakening, one of the better-known reform movements,opened a founding conference in Leipzig and outlined its politicalcourse for the May elections.   The fledgling opposition group said a German confederation``within a European peace order'' was the main aim of its platform.   It was not clear if Democratic Awakening supports reunificationof the Germanys or only close cooperation between the nations. Ithas drifted away from most of the other reform movements _including New Forum _ that say East Germany should remain asovereign state.   The Communist leadership also opposes reunification.   Also Saturday, a regional newspaper reported that the nation'ssecret police force once had planned a detention camp for``counterrevolutionaries.''   The report in the paper Thueringische Landeszeitung quoted anunidentified army major as saying the plans were discovered duringa search of a former secret police office in the community ofTautenhain, near Gera.   The current government is disbanding the once-feared secretpolice network as part of East Germany's democratic reforms.   Honecker's hard-line leadership had referred to some reformsactivists as s counterrevolutionaries.</TEXT></DOC>
