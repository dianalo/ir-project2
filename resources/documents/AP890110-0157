The Ministry of Overseas Territories said work on a second sitewas suspended after an agreement between the stationofficer-in-charge, Jean-Francois Houssin, and the Greenpeaceexpedition leader Peter Wilkinson.   Greenpeace alleged Saturday that 15 of its members visiting theAntarctic to monitor pollution and waste disposal at severalcountries' bases were beaten up by the French construction workers.The government denied there was a fight.   France has a 60-member team, half of them scientists, at theDumont d'Urville base where the airstrip is being built.   Greenpeace alleges the strip will open up the area for miningoperations, destroying the natural habitat and breeding ground ofthe Emperor and Adelie penguins.   Greenpeace said Houssin had seen a videotape of the brawl and``admitted the construction workers were out of control.''   In a call to Sydney, Australia, Wilkinson said the militantsplanned to picket one section of the base until Sunday, providingthere were no further disputes.   In Paris, the government denied development plans on the islandswould harm the environment. Officials say two studies were donebefore the development plans got the green light.   On Tuesday night, scientist and explorer Paul-Emile Victor wenton French TV to back the government claims.   Greenpeace previously clashed with France in 1985 when saboteursfound to be working for the French intelligence services blew up theorganisation's nuclear monitoring vessel, the Rainbow Warrior, inNew Zealand's Auckland harbor. One person was killed in the attack.</TEXT></DOC>
