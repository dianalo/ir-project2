Specificaly, the amendment would change TS 3.3.2.2, Table3.3-11, Steam and Feedwater Rupture Control System Instrumentation, functionalunit 5, Manual Initiation. The change would reduce the number of pushbuttonsfrom 10 to 4, and would redesignate the pushbuttons to reflect the actioninitiated by the pushbutton vice the system condition that would causethe operator to initiate manual action. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed changes are needed to permit control room modifications whichwill reduce the possibility of human error when initiating the SFRCS manually.The modifications will resolve the concerns regarding the manual initiationof auxiliary feedwater which is documented in the section on Control RoomImprovement in the Toledo Edison Course of Action report and Sections 3.3.3and 3.3.4 of NUREG-1177, Davis-Besse Restart Safety Evaluation. The Commission has evaluated the environmental impact of the proposed amendmentand has determined that neither the probability of accidents nor the post-accidentradiological releases would be greater than previously determined. Theproposed amendment does not otherwise affect radiological plant effluentsduring normal operation. In addition, the proposed amendment does not haveany influence upon occupational radiation exposure. Therefore, the Commissionconcludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impactsassociated with this proposed amendment. With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendmentdoes not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmentalimpact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significantnonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.The Notice of Consideration of issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 3, 1988 (53 FR 15757). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.Alternatives to the Proposed Action Since the Commission has concluded that the environmental effects of theproposed action are not significant, any alternative with equal or greaterenvironmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce the environmental impacts attributable to this facilityand would only result in retaining a serious human engineering defect inthe control room. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement related to operation of the Davis-Bessefacility. Agencies and Persons Consulted The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consultother agencies or persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact </ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed amendment. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.
