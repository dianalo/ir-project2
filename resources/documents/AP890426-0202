The 810-foot Exxon Philadelphia had drifted to the northwest,away from land, in an area without reefs and in water 600 feet deepwith calm seas and mild winds, Coast Guard Andre Billeaudeaux said.   A tugboat began towing the vessel to Port Angeles for repairsshortly after 3 p.m., Billeaudeaux said. The trip should take about20 hours.   The single-hulled tanker was about nine miles off Cape Flatteryand 12 miles west of the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fucawhen a boiler tube failed about 8:30 a.m., shutting down thepropulsion system, said Joe Tucker of Exxon in Valdez, Alaska. Thecrew of 20 never was in danger, Tucker said.   The incident occurred less than a month after the tanker ExxonValdez ran aground March 24 near Valdez, dumping 11.2 milliongallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound.   The Philadelphia, built in 1970, underwent a shipyard inspectionone month ago, Tucker said.   The tanker left the Alaska pipeline terminus at Valdez earlySunday for a non-Exxon refinery in Anacortes, about 65 miles northof Seattle, said Tucker and John Ratterman of Alyeska PipelineService Co. in Anchorage.   It carried 532,862 barrels of oil, or 22.38 gallons, accordingto the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation in Valdez.   One or two tankers a day make the journey from Valdez toAnacortes.</TEXT></DOC>
