TannenbaumStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CRZYTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)RETAILING (RET) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Crazy Eddie Inc. said it received a $7-a-share buyout bid from a group consisting of its founder, Eddie Antar, and a company controlled by the Belzberg brothers of Canada.    Although the proposal represents a premium over recent market prices for Crazy Eddie shares, which last week dropped as low as $4.625 in national over-the-counter trading, it drew criticism from investors because of Mr. Antar's involvement and because of a sequence of earlier events.    Crazy Eddie stock, which closed Tuesday at $5.25 a share, exceeded the proposed buyout price yesterday to close at $7.875, after the offer was announced. Wall Street analysts said some traders were speculating that the buyout group would be forced to raise its bid to $10 or $11 a share.    Although some analysts called the $7-a-share price fair -- considering Crazy Eddie's bleak near-term earnings outlook -- many Crazy Eddie investors may be disappointed because they paid much more than $7 for their shares; adjusted for splits, the stock sold as high as $21.625 last July. The company's convertible debentures, valued at $81 million last June, are now valued at about half that amount.    The N.J.-based company said that the buyout proposal was &quot;unsolicited&quot; and that the group making the offer claimed to already own a 14% stake. The company has about 31.3 million shares outstanding. Based on the $7-a-share bid, the company's common shares have an indicated value of about $219 million and the buyout group would pay about $188 million for the shares it doesn't already own. Crazy Eddie said it had been told that Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., the New York investment bankers, would help the buyers get financing.    Not long ago, the rapidly expanding electronics retail chain was a favorite of institutional investors, largely because of the drive and personal appeal of Mr. Antar himself.    But no longer. Last Nov. 10, Mr. Antar sold 1.5 million Crazy Eddie shares, for $13.875 each, without any formal filing of a secondary offering. A few days later, Mr. Antar disappeared from public view, fueling speculation which -- along with severe operating problems at the company -- exacerbated a decline in Crazy Eddie share prices.    In January, the company said Mr. Antar had resigned as chief executive officer for personal reasons while retaining the role of chairman. Later, the company reported nearly a 90% plunge in net income for the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 1, which analysts attributed to rising competition and Mr. Antar's absence as chief executive.    Mr. Antar's bid shocked some investors. &quot;We've had people call who are upset -- they question Eddie's integrity in this thing,&quot; said Donald I. Trott, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., the New York securities firm owned by Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.    Mr. Trott said, &quot;The guy (Mr. Antar) courted the institutional community, then disappeared when there were hard times. Now he reappears and offers to buy back the stock at a fraction of what many people paid for it. You get tremendous, irate resentment.&quot; But he said: &quot;That's emotionalism. As an investor, you don't have much choice but to go along with Eddie.&quot;    In Maryland, another analyst called the $7-a-share price fair, given the company's recent problems, but argued that Mr. Antar himself largely caused them by quitting as chief executive. &quot;There's been a complete demoralization inside the company, right down to the sales floor,&quot; he said.    Mr. Antar, who couldn't be reached yesterday, customarily refuses to talk to reporters; so do other officials of the company. David Kronfeld of Kekst andamp; Co., a New York public-relations firm retained by Crazy Eddie, said the company wouldn't elaborate on its announcement.    That announcement said Crazy Eddie &quot;would have no comment at this time on the offer,&quot; which it would consider &quot;in due course.&quot; Crazy Eddie said it was told that the $7-a-share bid was subject to a definitive merger agreement with Newco, a company to be formed by Mr. Antar, and another company identified as First City Capital Corp., which Mr. Kronfeld said was owned by the Belzberg brothers.    Some analysts and others close to the company, predicted that Mr. Antar's bid could cause new problems. Mr. Antar and Crazy Eddie already face two shareholder suits over his sale of company shares last November. In January, in a lawsuit filed in January, plaintiff Vivian G. Bernstein charged that Mr. Antar violated securities laws by withholding material information from other shareholders while selling his own shares.    In Delaware, plaintiffs Moshe J. Schwartz and James T. Cain filed a similar suit in February.    At least one company insider has paid less than $7 a share for Crazy Eddie shares in recent months. According to reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sam Antar, a cousin of the founder and now a member of a three-man office of the president, exercised options to buy 2,000 shares in January at $2.07 each and 3,000 shares at $4.94 each. Mr. Kronfeld said he wasn't aware of the options and that Sam E. Antar &quot;wouldn't want to comment.&quot;    For the fiscal year ended March 1, the company reported net income of $10.6 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with $13.2 million, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier figures were adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split. Sales for the latest year were $352.5 million, up from $262.3 million. </TEXT></DOC>
