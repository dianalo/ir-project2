The 800 workers are represented by the Confederation of National Trade Unions; their contract had expired Aug. 31. A union official said workers voted 82% in favor of the accord.    Noranda, a mining, manufacturing, and forest products company, said the settlement includes a $1,400 (Canadian) signing bonus and wage increases of 20 cents an hour every six months for a total of $1.20 over three years. The base rate at the end of the previous contract was $13.81 an hour.    The workers are set to return to work this morning, the union official said. </TEXT></DOC>
