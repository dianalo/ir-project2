Facing more than 8,000 troops, students shouted, ``Down withdictatorship, down with corruption!'' while top members of theCommunist Party hierarchy filed out of a funeral for ousted partychief Hu Yaobang.   The protest in Tiananmen Square, the symbolic political centerof China, was one of the clearest rejections ever of the Communistsystem by China's increasingly disaffected youth. It also markedthe culmination of a week-long commemoration of Hu's death lastSaturday.   During 15 hours of demonstrations that featured no majorincidents, the students waved colored pro-democracy banners andturned the plaza into a sea of red and white banners.   The students confronted China's leaders as they filed into amemorial service for Hu in the Great Hall, chanting anti-governmentslogans. Hu, who died of a heart attack, was 73.   The turnout was one of the largest in China since the Communistvictory over the Nationalists in 1949, and the biggest in 13 years,when the death of Premier Chou En-lai sparked an outpouring ofgrief and anger toward the leftist government and an end to the1966-76 Cultural Revolution.   But major differences with the bloody, spontaneous 1976 protestremained. Today's protest left few people injured and was wellorganized.   The government has rejected all the students' demands, includinggreater freedom of speech and press, more money for education,disclosure of the incomes of top officials and reassessment of Hu'shistorical role.   When the students ended their demonstration, they departedpeacefully in groups that represented about 30 universities inBeijing and other cities.   In Shanghai, about 1,500 people marched through downtown, alsoto commemorate Hu's death. Earlier today, about 2,000 studentsmarched on the campus of East Normal University.   In Beijing, the traffic was stopped along Changan Boulevard, thecapital's main avenue, and people climbed trees to get a betterview of the procession.   The students said they would go back to their campuses andboycott classes.   When the 4,000 officials attending the ceremony started toarrive this morning, the students let out a roar, waved theirbanners and raised their fingers in V-for-victory salutes.   Some officials, protected by a triple line of military troops,stopped momentarily to listen.   During the ceremony, party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang praisedhis predecessor, saying ``as a Marxist, Hu Yaobang led a gloriouslife.''   Hu was forced to resign in disgrace in January 1987 after beingaccused by party conservatives of being soft on studentdemonstrators and Western liberal ideas.   Zhao's 10-minute speech, before a large portrait of Hu draped inblack bunting, made no specific mention of Hu's ouster and did not,as demanded by the students, attempt to reassess Hu's performance.   Zhao said only that Hu was a man ``brave enough to admit hismistakes and to insist upon what he thought was right. He nevertried to hold back his opinions.''   Some of the aging ideologues who are believed to have engineeredHu's ouster did not attend the ceremony. Among those absent wereformer President Li Xiannian, former Politburo member Bo Yibo andformer party propaganda chief Deng Liqun.   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 84, looking tired and fragile,circled the glass-encased casket and shook hands with Hu's familyand wife, Li Zhao. Hu's body was clad in a Western suit and drapedwith a red Communist Party flag.   Flags were flown at half-staff on Tiananmen Square and in frontof the Communist Party headquarters, scene of a clash betweendemonstrators and police earlier this week.   The official Xinhua News Agency said 1 million people, some incrowds five deep, lined the streets to watch the motorcade thatcarried Hu's body to the Babaoshan state cemetery in westernBeijing for cremation.   It said people carried banners reading ``farewell, ComradeYaobang'' and ``Yaobang, we'll always remember you.''   Zhao's speech was broadcast over loudspeakers on the square butthe students paid little attention.   As soon as he finished they resumed their chants of ``long livedemocracy.'' As officials descended the steps of the Great Hall,they shouted: ``we demand dialogue!'' and ``come down Li Peng!''   Li, China's premier, is a technocrat regarded as lukewarm towardeconomic and political reforms. He has said that social stabilitymust take priority in China, and that ``excessive democracy'' wouldharm the nation.   Unlike the Soviet Union, which has held direct parliamentaryelections and given its press greater freedom, China has taken thelead in economic reforms. It has taken only small, cautious stepsto make its political system more open.</TEXT></DOC>
