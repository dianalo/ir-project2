President-elect Bush praised the effort, but reiterated hisintention to alter its design within weeks. He is expected to seekless military spending to make room for his priorities: a cleanerenvironment, better education and child care. Then Congress willrewrite it again.   Like all his others, Reagan's ninth budget is out of balance. Butthis deficit, at $92.5 billion, would be the smallest since the yearhe took office. When fiscal 199 ends on Sept. 30, 1990, theaccumulated national debt will exceed $3 trillion _ three times whatit was eight years ago when Reagan took office promising a balancedbudget in three years.   Reagan blamed Congress for his deficit reduction failures andtried again to persuade it to eliminate many domestic programs. Thistime, he proposed to save $4.9 billion by killing 82 of them _ manypreviously preserved by Congress, like subsidies for mass transit,rural development and export business.   Farm subsidies and child nutrition programs would be cut by $9.7billion. Limits would be placed on the growth in Medicare, whichprovides health insurance for Social Security recipients, andMedicaid, which covers poor people, saving $4.9 billion.   But Social Security itself is unscathed.   Military spending would increase $5 billion, to $303 billion, andthe nation would begin to build a permanent manned space station.   About $6 billion would be raised by selling government assets,and another $1 billion would come from increasing fees for variousgovernment services. Several corporate taxes would be cut _ by atotal of more than $2 billion.   The resulting $92.5 billion deficit would meet the $100 billiontarget of the Gramm-Rudman, deficit-reduction law, and represents asharp reduction from the $161.5 billion the White House anticipatesin the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.   ``This budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit ispossible without raising taxes,'' Reagan said in his budget message.``It can be done in a reasonable, responsible way _ with disciplineand fairness. New taxes are not required.''   Bush concurred.   ``The budget submitted by President Reagan today is an excellentbudget which demonstrates clearly that the (deficit-reduction)targets ... can be met and indeed exceeded without raising taxes,''said Bush in a statement.   ``Naturally, I support its intent,'' he continued. ``However, Iwill continue to review it for possible amendments after I assumethe office of the presidency.''   The Democratic-controlled Congress plans to relegate Reagan'sproposals to the status of reference books until Bush decides whichof it he will embrace and which he will change.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, labeled Reagan'splan ``largely irrelevant,'' and House Speaker Jim Wright called onBush to announce his own plans soon.   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., new chairman of the House BudgetCommittee, saw no surprises in the document, which he called ``thelast will and testament of the Reagan administration.''   ``The real question is whether the priorities of the outgoingadministration will be renewed or rejected by the newadministration,'' Panetta said.   ``It provides a formula for a meaner, harsher America rather thana kinder, gentler one,'' as Bush promised, said Senate budgetchairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn. ``It would be a serious mistake forGeorge Bush to dress up Ronald Reagan's budget in slightly differentclothes and expect it to be the basis for constructive budgetdebate,'' he said.   Panetta and Sasser have been openly skeptical that Bush cancomply with the Gramm-Rudman law while keeping his campaign promisesand still avoiding a tax increase.   House Republican leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., predicted Congresswould accept the Reagan budget's underlying assumption that theeconomy will remain strong with moderate inflation and interestrates. Reagan has been frequently criticized as too optimistic.   Overall, the budget proposes collecting $1.059 trillion inrevenues and spending $1.152 trillion, leaving a deficit of $92.5billion.   One ingredient of Reagan's budget which automatically takeseffect, unless vetoed by Congress, is a 50 percent pay raise for thecabinet, members of Congress, judges, and the federal government'stop managers.   Elsewhere in the budget, but only if Congress approves, is aproposed 2 percent pay increase for rank-and-file federal workers,3.6 percent for the military. Federal pensioners would get zero,their cost-of-living increase for next year canceled, althoughinflation this year is running about 4.4 percent.   The president's budget reflects the persistent demands on theTreasury to bail out insolvent savings and loan institutions,costing taxpayers $16 billion this year and $9 billion next year.Some $80 billion might be needed over the next few years, but Reaganleaves it to Bush to find the resources.   The continuing banking crisis and last summer's drought wereamong the chief reasonsthe administration's deficit estimate for thecurrent year was raised to $161.5 billion, up from $145 billionestimated last August, according to Joseph R. Wright Jr., thepresident's budget director.   The budget also proposes $3 billion to clean up and modernize thegovernment's aging nuclear weapons plants. The Energy Departmentestimates the project could cost as much as $128 billion over thenext two decades.   For the military, Reagan sought to extend his influence halfwayinto Bush's first term by submitting a two-year spending plan,including sharp increases in spending on anti-satellite andanti-missile weapons.   Reagan asked for $315.2 billion in military spending authorityfor fiscal 1990, of which $303 billion would actually be spentbefore the end of the fiscal year. The spending authority includesfunding for long-term projects and weapons buying in future years.   For fiscal 1991, the president requested $330.8 billion in budgetauthority and $314.4 billion in actual outlays.   On the domestic side, the president proposed spending increasesin select areas, including aviation safety, toxic waste cleanups andthe search for a cure for AIDS. The $1.4 billion increase in thespace program includes money to begin building the space station andlaunch 9 shuttle flights, and the budget also includes $250 millionto start work on a superconducting, supercollider physics laboratory.   The Reagan budget includes no general tax increase, although $1billion in new fees would be imposed for a variety governmentservices, including a 1 percent increase in the charge for veterans'home loan guarantees.   Commercial and recreational boaters would have to pay a $25annual fee for using waterways patrolled by the Coast Guard. Ascheduled cut in aviation taxes would be canceled.   All state and local government workers would be required to paythe Medicare tax, raising about $2 billion.   Meanwhile, corporate taxes would be cut under several proposals,including a $1.7 billion tax break for corporations operating abroad.   Reagan told a business group Monday that because of the currenteconomic expansion, ``the revenue is literally rolling in.'' The$370 billion in additional taxes expected because of the biggereconomy by 1994 means ``plenty of money to do the business ofgovernment.''   ``Raising taxes would be the surest way of killing the economicgoose that lays the golden egg,'' the president said.   In his eight years in office, Congress passed and Reagan signed13 separate tax increases that will cost taxpayers $150 billionduring the next budget year. Reagan-era tax reductions will savetaxpayers $377 billion next year, according to the budget documents.</TEXT></DOC>
