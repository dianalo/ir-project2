Without such bonds or similar financial mechanisms, coal miningwould necessarily be curtailed. Thus, some operators have turned to otherfinancial mechanisms allowable under the law, but these impose a heavierdrain on assets than uncollateralized bonds. Reclamation bonds, whosepremiums have consistently exceeded losses and expenses, have been oneof the more profitable property/casualty insurance lines. Members ofthe surety industry, however, feel that the uncertainties created byeconomic conditions in the coal market and the extended liability periodunder the law now make underwriting reclamation bonds an unattractiveprospect.</TEXT></DOC>
