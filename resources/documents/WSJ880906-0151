Hudson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP IBM </CO><IN> EDP </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   After months of hesitation, the European personal computer industry is gearing up to clone International Business Machines Corp.'s struggling new line of personal computers.    Starting this week with the announcement by Britain's Apricot Computer PLC, most of Europe's major personal-computer makers are expected to unveil plans to sell machines compatible with IBM's Personal System/2 line. Far from upsetting IBM, the rush of product-announcements from European rivals actually cheers the Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant: It confirms, analysts say, that IBM's PS/2s are selling well enough in Europe to justify an industrywide cloning campaign.    &quot;PS/2 may be in a difficult situation in America, but in Europe my feeling is large (computer-buying) accounts are preparing to step over&quot; from buying IBM's old PC and AT computers to the PS/2 range, says Franz Hatzenauer, president of Tulip Computer N.V., a small Dutch personal-computer maker. His company plans to unveil its own PS/2 clones next month, and begin shipping by year end. Like most of the Europeans, however, Tulip is hedging its bet by continuing to sell older AT-compatible models, as well as PS/2s.    PS/2 clones already have been unveiled by a few U.S. makers, such as Tandy Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas. But most U.S. manufacturers have yet to commit themselves publicly to starting PS/2-clone shipments, partly because of uncertainty over how big a hit PS/2 is in the U.S. In fact, a joint effort by a group of U.S. concerns, expected to be announced soon, indicates that many makers think they can continue to improve the performance of their machines and satisfy customers without cloning the PS/2.    In recent weeks, many U.S. market analysts have reported an erosion in IBM's share of the U.S. personal computer market, but a spokesman at IBM's European headquarters in Paris reiterated Friday that U.S. PS/2 sales are posting &quot;strong growth.&quot; Sales are &quot;even stronger in Europe,&quot; he said. IBM has said it shipped nearly two million PS/2s world-wide in the year following the April 1987 launch, but hasn't disclosed regional sales figures.    The IBM spokesman added that the European product announcements confirm the company's view that PS/2 &quot;is the way forward for our customers into 1990s.&quot;    IBM launched the PS/2 line to regain market share lost to U.S., European and Asian clones of its PC and AT lines. Besides improved graphics, a more-versatile software system, and a higher price tag, most PS/2 models have &quot;Micro Channel Architecture,&quot; or MCA. That's IBM's name for its new &quot;bus,&quot; or electrical circuitry that shuttles data inside the computer. Although many analysts discount the claim, IBM contends MCA is a crucial component of PS/2, making it work faster and better than older models.    IBM's sales pitch appears to be winning over many customers in Europe, analysts say. One market research firm, Paris-based Intelligent Electronics S.A., says PS/2 has stopped the decline in IBM's European market share -- and may even be regaining territory. In the first six months of 1988, it estimates, IBM collected 31.7% of the revenue generated from sales of personal computers to European businesses, virtually unchanged from the year-earlier 31.5%. Measuring numbers of computers, IBM's share inched up to 25.7% from the year-earlier 24.8% share.    One common explanation given for PS/2's stronger European performance is that many European businesses, previously slow to computerize, now are boosting their personal computer budgets faster than U.S. firms.    By 1990, Tulip's Mr. Hatzenauer predicts European sales of PS/2 and its clones will match sales of AT machines and compatibles. Though a letdown from PS/2's initial billing as IBM's &quot;clonekiller,&quot; that's still encouraging enough to prompt many makers to stop hesitating and to try their luck with PS/2 clones.    First in Europe is Britain's Apricot, which yesterday unveiled its PS/2-compatible range at a news conference here. Dubbed &quot;Qi&quot;, the Apricot machines include a fast data bus compatible with IBM's MCA, using components purchased from San Jose, Calif.-based Chips andamp; Technologies Inc. The machines, scheduled to be available for shipment in October, are to be sold at prices slightly below IBM's PS/2 range but offer additional features to appeal to large corporate computerbuyers.    Next will be Amstrad Consumer Electronics PLC of Britain. On Sept. 13, the company is scheduled to unveil a range of new business computers, including some based on an MCA-like bus. Similar MCA-machine launches are scheduled later this year by Tulip, France's Groupe Bull and Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co., the second-largest maker in Europe after IBM. </TEXT></DOC>
