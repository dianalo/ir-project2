The energy input to energy output ratiosare evaluated for five wave energy devices. Only one has a value of lessthan unity and hence satisfies the basic criteria of energetic viability.It is argued that these results raise serious questions about the rationalityon continuing with major funding of the UK wave energy programme.</TEXT></DOC>
