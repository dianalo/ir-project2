Greiff (WSJ Special) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The dollar overcame a round of coordinated intervention by the West German Bundesbank, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and five other European central banks to finish New York trading little changed as bullish sentiment on the U.S. currency continued unabated.    The dollar sales had little immediate impact on trading, temporarily slowing the dollar's rise. The dollar was quoted at 1.8424 marks in late New York trading yesterday, up from 1.8415 marks late Friday, and at 133.16 yen, down from 133.35 yen.    The dollar was quoted at 132.85 yen in early trading in Tokyo Tuesday.    During most of Monday, the dollar traded at or above intervention levels, but receded at the end of New York trading as dealers took profits on intraday positions in a thin market.    The Bundesbank stepped in when the dollar was trading around 1.8440 marks, which was up from its levels late Friday, and continued selling dollars throughout the morning, dealers said.    Later, the central banks of Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium joined the interventions with what dealers called fairly small amounts. All but the Dutch confirmed the dollar sales.    The Fed intervened during mid-morning trading in the U.S., selling dollars around 1.8450 marks, with little apparent impact. One trader said the Fed had sold between $100 million and $150 million on the open market. A Fed spokesman, in keeping with policy, would neither confirm nor deny whether the central bank had intervened.    The fact that the interventions occurred as central bankers from 10 leading industrial nations were attending a regular monthly meeting at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, and that they were confirmed by several central banks, left little doubt in traders' minds that they had been coordinated.    But the scale of the interventions led many to question the central banks' determination to foil the dollar's recent rally.    In addition, some European central bankers who attended the BIS meeting were disappointed that the intervention had failed to brake the dollar's surge.    &quot;I've always said it makes no sense if the Deutsche mark is depreciating and not only against the dollar,&quot; Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said after the meeting. &quot;But what can we do. We sold substantial amounts of dollars.&quot; Mr. Poehl declined to comment about suggestions that the Bundesbank soon might raise its securities repurchase rate.    At least one European central bank official expressed hope for poor U.S. trade figures later this week. &quot;If we get some bad trade figures, (the dollar) could go the other way,&quot; the official said.    European central banks and the Fed last intervened in a coordinated manner on June 27 and June 28, failing to halt the dollar's upward trend.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $434.60 an ounce, down $4.50. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $435.50 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---   Peter Norman in Basel, Switzerland, contributed to this article.    ---                  Late New York Trading                  Monday, July 11, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
