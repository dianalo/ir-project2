BirnbaumStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTCONGRESS (CNG)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Senators voted overwhelmingly to block hefty pay raises for top federal officials, including themselves, but the action is unlikely to stop the increases from going into effect next week.    Both the Senate and House must vote to halt the increases before Wednesday to prevent them from going through. The House, however, at the urging of its leaders, isn't expected to act by the deadline, thus allowing lawmakers' base annual salary to rise to $89,500 from the current $77,400, an increase of nearly 16%. Federal judges and cabinet officers also are scheduled to receive pay increases.    Yesterday, the Senate was filled with angry rhetoric about the unseemliness of lawmakers' voting themselves a salary increase at a time when they say they are interested in reducing federal budget deficits. The final vote was 87-7.    But many of the senators voted to block their own raises with the secure knowledge that the House probably will allow the raises to happen simply by doing nothing.    &quot;What we are about to do is going to be meaningless,&quot; Sen. Gordon Humphrey (R., N.H.) told colleagues before yesterday's Senate vote. &quot;More than likely, the House will do nothing and the pay raise will go into effect automatically.&quot;    &quot;It's a very easy vote for them,&quot; said a senior Democratic aide in the House. &quot;They know we're determined to ride this one out.&quot;    Still, the senators approached the tricky political question of a pay increase reluctantly. &quot;There's no issue I dread facing and voting on more than this,&quot; said Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas). The outcome, however, was never much in doubt. &quot;No one here wants to take the abuse of voting for a salary increase,&quot; said Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio).    Along the way, the Senate crushed two amendments. One, by Sen. Pete Wilson (R., Calif.), would have allowed the raises recommended by President Reagan to go into effect for top federal officials other than members of Congress. The other, by Sen. Lowell Weicker (R., Conn.), would have increased congressional salaries to $120,000 a year, but would have prevented senators from accepting honoraria from special interest groups to supplement their income.    The Weicker amendment was defeated even after Sen. Weicker noted that senators' income could total $125,000 a year, including honoraria, if the proposed pay increases take effect.    Permitting senators to earn 40% of their congressional salary in honoraria is &quot;a corruption waiting to happen,&quot; Sen. Weicker asserted. &quot;It's wrong.&quot;    Separately, the Senate voted to provide an additional $50 million to aid the homeless. The measure was similar to a bill passed earlier this week by the House.    An amendment attached to the Senate measure would disapprove a controversial proposal by President Reagan to defer funds that Congress has already appropriated for the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance program. The program underwrites the expense of storing and distributing surplus food provided to needy families by state agencies.    The Senate attached to the homeless bill the resolution that would block the pay raise for federal officials. But the consequence of that action probably is nil, because the House isn't likely to consider the legislation until after the salary increase is scheduled to take effect. </TEXT></DOC>
