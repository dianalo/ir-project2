Strikes against South African Transport Services are illegalbecause its rail, trucking and harbor operations are designated asessential.   The company fired 626 workers earlier this week and said morethan 800 others were being fired today.   Police headquarters said violence broke out at a railway stationin Germiston, near Johannesburg, when about 50 strikers arrived bytrain for a union meeting without having paid their rail fares.   Officers moved in to arrest the men and were attacked withsticks, whips and stones, police said. Strikers scattered afterofficers fired two pistol shots, according to police, who saidthree officers were injured.   An hour later, three more officers were hurt trying to disperseabout 150 strikers outside a union office in Germiston, accordingto police headquarters. No arrests were reported in either incident.   The dispute centers on a demand by the South African Railwyasand Harbor Workers for the minimum wage to be increased to $570 amonth from $230. Other issues in dispute are the union's objectionto possible privatization and the company's refusal to officiallyrecognize the union.   Most of the strikers are in the Johannesburg-Pretoria area andthe port city of Durban.   The union, which says 40,000 workers are striking, is affiliatedto the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the country'slargest and most militantly anti-apartheid labor federation.   The union claims a membership of 40,000 of the total 180,000black workers employed by the transport company.   The transport strike is one of two bitter, nationwide labordisputes that show no signs of resolution.   About 6,000 black employees of South African Breweries, thecountry's privately owned beer monopoly, have been on strike forfive weeks.   On Wednesday, the brewery workers' union lowered its wage demandfor the first time, saying it would accept a 32 percent increaseinstead of a 38 percent increase. But management maintained itsrefusal to change its ``final'' offer of a 16 percent raise.   Seven deaths have been linked to the strike.   Police officials also said today that 15 black activists hadbeen arrested for participating in an illegal meeting in Alexandra,a township adjoining Johannesburg. The meeting followed theannouncement that a magistrate had refused to grant permission fora protest march in Alexandra on Saturday.   Organizers hoped 30,000 would join the march to demand newhousing, an end to evictions and the writing off of arrears accruedduring a three-year rent boycott.</TEXT></DOC>
