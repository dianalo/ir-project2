This salmon, one of five salmon species in theColumbia River system, wasn't seen last fall in the upperreaches of the Snake River, where it normally goes to spawn.The National Marine Fisheries Service has recommended that itbe listed as an endangered species; if the interior secretarydoes so, a battle over allocation of water in the Columbiabasin will begin.   Sockeye salmon are in trouble because of the eight majordams on the Columbia River system. Fish ladders help adultsalmon returning from the sea get around the dams, but youngsalmon trying to migrate to the sea in the spring are suckedinto the turbines. Many salmon are killed by predators,disease and warm water when they are trapped in slack waterbehind the dams. All told, nearly 90% of the young salmon arelost, mainly because water flows are insufficient to push thejuveniles to the Pacific.</LP><TEXT>   If the sockeye is listed as an endangered species, damoperators will be required to let more water flow downstream.That means the water would not be stored in the spring tomeet peak summer demand. As a result, electricity pricescould rise as much as 33%, and ranchers and farmers couldlose several million acre-feet of water that now irrigateorchards, vineyards, forage and crops.   There is not enough water for both salmon and man because,throughout the Columbia system, vast federal subsidies haveled to overbuilding of dams and overuse of water. Irrigatorspay only a tiny fraction of the construction costs of thesedams; and on even that payment they have a grace period of 10years during which they are exempt from repaying federalloans. And when they finally do repay, it is withoutinterest. Such concessions add up to a more than 90% subsidyof agricultural water users. Electricity consumers are not solavishly supported by the taxpayer, but Columbia system ratesare still as much as 40% less than elsewhere in the country.With payments so low, the incentive has been irresistible toexpand irrigation and energy production far beyond the levelpeople would demand if they were paying the true cost.   In the past, environmentalists and sports and commercialfishermen -- people who had an interest in preserving salmon-- were largely outside the political process that madedecisions about water supply and allocation. Now that theyhave won political power through the Endangered Species Actand popular opinion, they are preparing to use that power inthe same way that farm interests once did -- to seize controlof the Columbia's water for their own interest.   But rather than more political allocation of water, thesockeye salmon needs a healthy dose of free marketenvironmentalism. By establishing clear, transferable rightsto water, which do not exist now, a market can evolve. Ratherthan lose their water, some irrigators might give it upwillingly for an attractive price, tailoring their uses morecarefully and perhaps wasting less. Some electric utilitiesmight buy peak power elsewhere. The adjustments would be madevoluntarily and judiciously, without the rancor caused byforced transfers.   Consider the Gunnison River in Colorado. Because rights toits water were clearly owned, the Nature Conservancy hassucceeded in protecting an endangered fish, the humpbackchub. Pittsburgh and Midway Coal Co. had held rights toGunnison water, which it had planned to divert for oil-shaledevelopment. The Nature Conservancy persuaded the coalcompany to transfer to it 20,000 acre-feet of water, which itthen left in the stream. Similarly, the Nature Conservancyhas purchased water from irrigators to increase the amount ofwater that flows through the parched marshland of theStillwater National Refuge in Nevada.   Unfortunately, rights to Columbia River water cannot betraded among interested parties. If it were legal fororganizations interested in the preservation of salmon topurchase water rights, they could bid for low-valued waterand leave it in the stream. But today in the PacificNorthwest, environmentalists have only one option -- to usetheir political power to wrest water from other uses.   That power, however, might not prevail for long. In 1992the Endangered Species Act will be up for renewal byCongress. Given the tremendous conflict the act hasgenerated, it will be under severe challenge. Rep. WilliamDannemeyer (R., Calif.) is considering introducinglegislation that would enable water marketing on federalprojects. Such progressive legislation offers a much betterway of preserving stream and wetland habitat.Environmentalists have embraced water marketing elsewherebecause it reduces waste. It is time for them to put theirmoney where the endangered species are.   ---   Mr. Anderson, an associate of the Political EconomyResearch Center in Bozeman, Montana, is the co-author of&quot;Free Market Environmentalism&quot; (Pacific Research Institute,1991.)</TEXT></DOC>
