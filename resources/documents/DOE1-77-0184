During 37 degrees C incubations, the labeled 440-kDainsulin receptors were continuously internalized (as assessed by trypsininaccessibility) and degraded such that up to 50% of the initially labeledreceptors were lost by 120 min. Metabolic poisons (0.125-0.75 mM 2,4-dinitrophenol(DNP) and 1-10 mM NaF), which led to dose-dependent depletion of adipocyteATP pools, inhibited receptor loss, and caused up to 3-fold increasein intracellular receptor accumulation. This effect was due to inhibitionof intracellular receptor degradation, and there was no apparent effectof the metabolic poisons on initial internalization of the receptors.Following maximal intracellular accumulation of labeled insulin receptorsin the presence of NaF or DNP, removal of these agents resulted in asubsequent, time-dependent degradation of the accumulated receptors.However, when the lysosomotropic agent, chloroquine (0.2 mM), was addedimmediately following removal of the metabolic poisons, further degradationof the intracellularly accumulated receptors was prevented, suggestingthat the chloroquine-sensitive degradation of insulin receptors occursdistal to the site of inhibition by NaF or DNP. To confirm this, maximalintracellular accumulation of labeled receptors was first allowed tooccur in the presence of chloroquine and the cells were then washed andreincubated in chloroquine-free media in the absence or presence of NaFor DNP. Under these conditions, degradation of the intracellularly accumulatedreceptors continued to occur, and NaF or DNP failed to block the degradation.</TEXT></DOC>
