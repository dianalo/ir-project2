The convenience store chain also announced its losses widened to$169.4 million in the first quarter of 1989.   Southland President Jere W. Thompson attributed the loss, whichincluded $56 million from a one-time debt exchange offer inJanuary, to the high interest and non-cash charges brought aboutits 1987 leveraged buyout.   The costly after-effects of the LBO, which Southland officialsexpect to continue until 1992, obliterated a successful three-monthmerchandising period, company officials said.   Thompson said Southland must continue to ``aggressively seekways to reduce the size and cost of our LBO-related debt.''   Alternatives to reduce the company's debt include selling itsshare in Citgo and seeking a way to generate cash from thedistribution and processing centers _ possibly through a sale,financing or some sort of joint venture, the company said.   Citgo, based in Tulsa, Okla., has attractive assets, includingthe nation's eighth largest petroleum refinery, in Lake Charles,La., Thompson said.   Thompson said Southland intends to continue its product supplycontract with Citgo, even if its stake in the company is sold.   The five distribution centers and six food centers supply morethan 8,000 retail and food service customers in 43 state, theDistrict of Columbia and Puerto Rico.   ``We expect that the majority of the proceeds we receive will beapplied to, and would significantly reduce, the remaining $1.56billion of our LBO bank debt,'' Thompson said.   The first quarter loss of $169.4 million compared with a deficitof $71.5 million in the first three months of 1988.   Revenue as pegged at $1.90 billion, an increase of 6.1 percentover the $1.79 billion for the same period a year earlier.   Southland is the world's largest convenience retailer, and hasabout 7,000 7-Eleven and other convenience units in the UnitedStates and Canada.</TEXT></DOC>
