The caution is indicated by the failure of UAL stock to make thehuge leaps in value that characterized the stock shortly afterCalifornia investor Marvin Davis announced earlier this year he wasinterested in acquiring UAL.   Davis' $275-a-share, $6.19 billion offer for UAL was laterfollowed by one from a pilot-management group, which made a$300-a-share, $6.75 billion.   UAL stock was trading at a 52-week high of $294 a share inOctober, when it appeared the pilot-management group's offer seemedclose to success.   Samuel Buttrick, an analyst with Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. in NewYork, said UAL stock has been on a roller coaster since thecollapse of the pilot-management buyout offer.   UAL stock lost 40 percent of its value with the bid's collapse,at one point trading around $145 a share, Buttrick said. UAL stockclosed Monday at $182.25 a share, up $2.75, in consolidated NewYork Stock Exchange trading.   ``It has been a very rocky road for UAL stock,'' Buttrick said,noting its price rose when Coniston Partners announced its 9.7percent stake in UAL, then fell as speculators became impatientwith the lack of positive news on a new management bid.   Coniston Partners, a New York investment group, has threatened adrive to oust 13 of UAL's 15 directors and create a five-memberboard dominated by Coniston if the company's board fails to sell orrestructure UAL.   UAL stock climbed $5.25 on Monday, following Coniston'sannouncement it had increased its stake in the company to 11.8percent and after reports of a revised employee buyout proposalwere circulated over the weekend.   Analysts believe the board's buyout plan will value the companyat $210 to $240 a share, or a total of $4.75 billion to $5.42billion.   Buttrick said the rise in UAL stock price reflects aconfirmation of what everybody suspected was going on behind thescenes.   ``The answer as to why the price hasn't gone higher is thatthere isn't a confirmed deal,'' he said.   Bobbie Pilkington, a spokeswoman for the United chapter of theAssociation of Flight Attendants, said Tuesday that a revisedbuyout plan will be presented to the union on Wednesday.   The session was to have been the start of a new round ofcontract talks between the union and the airline. The flightattendants have been working without a contract for two years.   UAL management is believed to be seeking ironclad commitmentsfrom lenders and the company's three major unions before publiclyannouncing a revised buyout effort.   The previous buyout attempt was led by United's management,pilots and British Airways PLC. That bid failed in October whenlenders refused to finance it, citing the strong opposition of theMachinists.   Telephone calls to Machinist union headquarters for comment onthe revised buyout effort were not returned Tuesday.   United pilots have long sought ownership of the carrier, thenation's second-largest, and are believed to be working withmanagement on the new proposal.   Spokeswoman Kathie Hardin of the United chapter of the Air LinePilots Association declined to comment Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
