Silver is removed fromthe matrix by reduction with hydrazine and the following ion exchangeseparation employs cation and anion exchange columns in tandem usinghydrochloric acid/acetone and hydrobromic/nitric acid as the main elutingagents for the two respective columns. Overall efficiency rates for thethree product radionuclides are in excess of 99%.</TEXT></DOC>
