The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, is close to aState Department team that is interrogating Indian professorMithileshwar Singh.   Singh said he and three Americans held with him _ Jesse Turner,41, a native of Boise, Idaho; Alann Steen, 49, of Boston; andRobert Polhill, 54, of New York City _ were moved frequently bytheir abductors to thwart efforts to locate them, the sourcedisclosed.   Singh, an Indian citizen and a resident alien of the UnitedStates, was flown to Wiesbaden Wednesday for medical checks at aU.S. military hospital. He told medical officials he plans toreturn to the United States.   The educator was released on Monday after 20 months ofcaptivity, but his three American colleagues are still held.   According to the source, Singh has ``given no indications he wasabused'' while a captive and his comments indicated that Turner,Steen and Polhill ``are not in a life-threatening situation.''   The source said he could release few details about theconditions of Singh's captivity.   Six other Americans are also missing and believed held captivein Lebanon, as are seven other foreigners.   The source said Singh and the three Americans ``got movedfrequently.''   ``He was moved around at least half a dozen times.''   ``Wherever he was before he was released, the others would notbe there now,'' said the source.   The State Department team questioned Singh for a second dayThursday. The source told The Associated Press that Singh has beenspeaking with the special team two to three times a day, for aboutan hour and a half in each sitting.   He said the interrogators are members of a ``standard debriefingteam'' used to question released hostages.   Asked if they included FBI or CIA officials, the source saidonly: ``You're not out of the ballpark.''   He reiterated that Singh had no contact with American hostagesother than Turner, Steen and Polhill.   All four taught at Beirut University College. Gunmen posing aspolice abducted them on Jan. 24, 1987, on the campus in Moslem westBeirut.   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation ofPalestine claimed responsibility and said it freed Singh as agoodwill gesture.   According to the official, the four captives apparently hadlittle contact with the outside world.   ``As far as they (the U.S. questioners) know, he had nonewspapers,'' said the official.   Singh has not spoken with reporters since arriving in WestGermany.   ``He's reticent to talk in public. He doesn't know how thoseholding his friends would react,'' said the source.   No sign has emerged from Singh's comments that other hostageswould be released soon, he added _ ``We had no indications anybodyelse will be released soon or at all.''   The source added: ``There are indications that they (thehostage-takers) are backed by Iran, we assume financed by Iran.''   Earlier Thursday, U.S. Air Force spokesman Master Sgt. CharlesFick said Singh was receiving medical treatment.   ``Mr. Singh says he feels much better today,'' Fick reported.   On Wednesday, Air Force medical officials said Singh sufferedfrom ``tremendous fatigue'' following his captivity.</TEXT></DOC>
