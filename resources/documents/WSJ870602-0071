The typical rate for a 10-year loan on existing properties was 10.375% to 10.625% last month -- up from 9% to 9.5% in April. The Citicorp unit said that overall, rates rose an average of 0.5% to 0.75% from April, but that several major lenders' rates rose a full percentage point and that rates of two of the largest rose only 0.25%. Most lenders now review rates daily, Citicorp said, and several have posted three increases in a single week.    Lenders report that demand for commercial mortgages has declined in the wake of two months of rising mortgage rates. At major life insurance companies, commitments for commercial mortgages are running 20% to 50% below projections, Citicorp reported.    The Citicorp May survey also said that for existing properties, the typical rate on five-year loans was 9.25% to 10.375%; the typical rate was 10.5% to 10.875% for 15-year loans.    The monthly survey is based on reports by 13 life insurance companies, one thrift, one fund adviser, one credit company, one bank, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and the Federal National Mortgage Association. </TEXT></DOC>
