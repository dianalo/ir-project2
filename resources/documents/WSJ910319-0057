The announcement followed a disclosure last week by NovaPharmaceutical Corp. of Baltimore that it had received anexclusive license to exploit the human brain cell culturesfor possible use as transplants to treat neurologicalillnesses, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.Nova also has rights to use the Johns Hopkins's brain cellcultures in testing drugs for neurological effects.</LP><TEXT>   The school said it also will grant nonexclusive licensesto other drug and biotechnology companies who want to use theline of brain cells for testing drugs for safety andefficacy. It said the cells already are being used by 145university and government scientists for basic researchpurposes.   Human brain cells ordinarily don't reproduce in the bodyafter birth or in the test tube. Last year, however, JohnsHopkins scientists, headed by neuroscientist Solomon Snyder,announced they had induced human brain cells to beginmultiplying in the test tube. The cells were originally takenduring surgery on a young girl. The brain cells, or neurons,are now maintained in continuous culture at the university.   In addition to his work for Johns Hopkins, Dr. Snyder isNova's chief scientific adviser; however, he isn't involvedin the licensing of the brain cells to Nova or othercompanies.</TEXT></DOC>
