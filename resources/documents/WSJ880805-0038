Hudson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> ABT GNE </CO><IN> PHA </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Genentech Inc.'s flagship product, a genetically engineered heart drug called TPA, breaks up lung blood clots faster and more safely than an older rival, U.S. researchers reported.    A study led by doctors at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital found that TPA, or tissue plasminogen activator, was nearly twice as effective as urokinase, a rival clot dissolver, in quickly clearing up acute pulmonary embolisms. The potentially fatal clots dissolved within two hours among 82% of patients given Genentech's Activase brand of TPA, compared with 48% who used Abbokinase, Abbott Laboratories's brand of urokinase.    Abbott disputed the findings yesterday in North Chicago, Ill., arguing that the study was seriously flawed and misleading. An Abbott researcher who took part in the study said it relied on outdated information about the way to administer urokinase and about its correct dosage.    The study, scheduled for publication tomorrow in the Lancet, a weekly British medical journal, was the first to compare the drugs in treating the fairly common ailment. The results may encourage greater hospital use of TPA for pulmonary embolisms, said Dr. Kathleen Reagan, a member of the team led by Brigham cardiologist Dr. Samuel Goldhaber. Only 48 patients were involved in the study, the team said, and further research is planned.    The study didn't address a number of important questions about TPA, such as whether it is better than other treatments in increasing the chances of long-term survival after heart attacks. That issue, a welter of conflicting research reports and Activase's steep price of more than $2,000 a dose have contributed to a drag on the drug's sales, analysts and hospital administrators say. Analysts believe second-quarter sales approached $50 million.    When South San Francisco, Calif.-based Genentech introduced Activase in the U.S. last November, analysts billed it as the first potential &quot;blockbuster&quot; product of the young genetic engineering industry. Previously, the drug's clot-dissolving properties had been established in studies of heart attack victims.    The drug is mainly used to treat heart attacks, but TPA research now is focusing on many other ailments including pulmonary embolisms, which afflict about 50,000 Americans a year and kill 15% to 17% of them, Dr. Reagan said. In most cases, doctors administer a drug that thins the blood and helps break up the clot gradually. In only about 2% of the cases now, doctors prescribe an agent such as urokinase or TPA to attack the blockage directly.    Arthur Sasahara, Abbott's director of thrombolytic research, said the Lancet study was &quot;really designed wrong.&quot; Dr. Sasahara, who was involved in the study, said that when the researchers framed the study in 1986, they used 20-year-old data on how to administer urokinase, resulting in a dosage that was given too slowly and in too small a quantity to be effective. While subjects received an effective dose of TPA, they received just one-third of the amount of urokinase now known to be effective. &quot;It's like comparing a mandarin orange to a giant orange,&quot; Dr. Sasahara said. He added that a second study is expected to be completed by year end and that its results should be more meaningful.    ---   Frank E. James in Chicago contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
