Tokyo will join you in the ranksof cities with eight-digit phone numbers.   Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. said Tuesday that the changefrom seven-digit phone numbers in Tokyo will take place Jan. 1,1991. Subscribers will add a 3 at the beginning of their seven-digitnumbers.   The national telephone utility said a shortage of exchangenumbers began showing up in 1981 as demand increased for facsimileand microcomputer communications on top of demand for regulartelephone lines.   Some eight-digit phone numbers were given to pocket pagers in1987, and in 1988 some new subscribers for regular phones receivedeight-digit numbers, NTT said, but by early 1991 the shortage willbe acute.   Unlike in France, which has had eight-digit local phone numbersthroughout the country for several years, the change in Japan willaffect only phone numbers in Tokyo, a city of 12 million people.</TEXT></DOC>
