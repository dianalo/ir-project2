The areas covered are organic materials,optical fibers, semiconductor devices and compound semiconductors. Studiesand survey have so far been made in structure of the data base, its operation,the items of data, the data format, etc. In the data base, the data arecollected at a host computer and the subscribers have then access tothe data base by personal computer through communication circuits. Thedata base should be useful in the following: selection of radiation-resistantmaterials, aid in facilities construction, machinery and apparatus design,grasping of the trends in technology and research and development, developmentof materials, and so on.
