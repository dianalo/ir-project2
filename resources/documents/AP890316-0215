MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Crude oil futures prices surged to a nearly17-month high, fueled by a report showing a drop in inventories andongoing signals that OPEC is continuing to cut production.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, rose 48 centsWednesday to close at $19.77 a barrel. The last time the near-monthcontract was higher was on Oct. 30, 1987, when the contract closedat $19.96 a barrel.   On Monday, the April contract broke through the $19 mark for thefirst time since Jan. 19, closing at $19.03. On Tuesday, thecontract rose to $19.29.   Other contract months also recorded healthy gains Wednesday.   Refined oil products also soared. The April contract for unleadedgasoline jumped 2.30 cents, settling at a 19-month high of 55.80cents a gallon. The near-month contract last closed higher on Aug.4, 1987, at 55.92 cents.   Heating oil scheduled for April delivery rose 1.79 cents to closeat 54.19 cents a gallon.   Contracts scheduled for delivery later in the year also advancedsharply.   Analysts said weekly statistics from the American PetroleumInstitute proved positive for the market. The report, released afterthe close of trading Tuesday, showed crude oil stocks fell 2.3million barrels last week, gasoline dropped 4.7 million barrels anddistillates, including heating oil, were down 5.9 million barrels.   The drop in inventories reflected a sharp increase in demand,said Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst with E.D.andamp;F. ManInternational Futures Inc. Over the last four weeks, demand for oilproducts has jumped 9 percent, Lebow said.   ``I don't know why,'' he said. ``It's contraseasonal in the caseof heating oil and very bullish for the market.''   Traders said the strong demand for gasoline is due in part toconcern about the availability of gasoline during the summer monthswhen retail sales increase. Analysts have said U.S. refiningcapacity is particularly tight this year and an extra burden isbeing placed on some refiners as several eastern states introducenew higher octane regulations.   ``People thought we would see a buildup in stocks before Easter,or at least see them hold steady,'' Lebow said. ``I think right nowthe supplies are adequate but this new report brings into questionwhether we'll have enough.''   Prices also got a lift Wednesday from an unconfirmed report thatSaudi Arabia, the largest producer among the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, was cutting production to U.S. andEuropean customers, traders said.   Despite the reports, the market's underlying fundamentals werestrong to start with, said Bob Baker, an analyst withPrudential-Bache Securities Inc.   ``There's an overall good indication of a healthy economy. Andthere's a good demand for crude because OPEC oil producers seem tobe serious about their price target.''   The 13 OPEC countries recently agreed to cut production in aneffort to raise oil prices. The agreement took effect Jan. 1 andextends for six months.</TEXT></DOC>
