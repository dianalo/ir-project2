The institute was created by theCalifornia Association of Realtors and is staffed by personnel from thereal-estate trade group.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Home  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FIRST-TIME BUYERS HINDERED BY LACK OF INFORMATION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Real EstateBradley Inman is an Oakland-based real estate writer.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Based on its survey of likely first-time buyers, the report concluded that&quot;in addition to the financial obstacles, many prospective first-time homebuyers are hampered by a lack of knowledge of the home-buying process and thetypes of assistance available.&quot;;    Only 25 percent of those surveyedconsidered themselves &quot;very knowledgeable&quot; about the ins and outs of buying ahouse. Although 40 percent were familiar with neighborhoods that they couldafford, less than a quarter of them knew how large a home loan they couldqualify for.;    The vast majority of first-time buyers knew nothing aboutspecial financing programs; for example, less than 15 percent were &quot;veryknowledgeable&quot; about private mortgage insurance, through which a buyer mayobtain a loan for less than 20 percent down. Most had never heard of equitysharing arrangements or seller financing options, which could help thempurchase homes with smaller down payments.;    The needs of first-time homebuyers, the study pointed out, often differ from those of repeat buyers orinvestors. &quot;They need different information, such as the changing rules withgovernment programs and new ways of providing private financing,&quot; said ChrisTaylor, a research manager with the Department of Real Estate.;    Whenquestioned about government programs, most of the buyers surveyed drew ablank. Only 46 percent had a limited understanding of Federal HousingAdministration loans, while 40 percent were familiar with veterans' mortgageprograms.;    The report also showed that many licensed real-estate agentsweren't very well-versed in the available government resources. &quot;We weresurprised to learn how little some agents knew about these special programs tohelp first-time buyers,&quot; said John Liberator, deputy director of theDepartment of Real Estate.;    Most of the agents surveyed had a &quot;moderate&quot;understanding of federal loan programs, but only a third of them were &quot;veryknowledgeable&quot; about FHA loan programs, only 31 percent had a good grasp ofveterans' loan programs and only 12 percent were on top of state financingoptions, such as those offered by the California Housing Finance Agency.;   There are several explanations for this apparent blind spot. In the go-goreal-estate market of the late 1980s, some real-estate agents shunnedfirst-time buyers; entry-level homes bring in smaller commissions. Plus, newbuyers tend to take more time looking for homes. When they find a home, theycan be more difficult to qualify; if they use government assistance programs,the paperwork can complicate the escrow and delay the closing of atransaction. Finally, most of these programs are restricted in theiravailability.;    The government agencies themselves are also to blame, Taylorsaid. &quot;The real nuts and bolts of how these programs work never get out to thepublic,&quot; she said.;    The Department of Real Estate is hopeful that the studywill help licensed real-estate agents better understand the programs thatexist.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; A copy of the home-buying report is available for$9 from the Publications Department of the California Department of RealEstate, 2201 Broadway, Sacramento 95818.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Bradley Inman column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910817  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  647  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday August 17, 199100230172,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
