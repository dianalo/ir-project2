A Soviet general confirmed for the first time that one-third ofhis country's nuclear warheads designed to strike the United Stateswere on Cuba at the time. However, he and another Soviet officialsaid the warheads had not been mounted on missile launchers and werenot ready for firing.   Also, Cuban leader Fidel Castro urged Moscow to launch a nuclearattack on the United States, ABC News reported.   The revelations came during a review of the Cuban missile crisisat a conference during the weekend at a trade union center insouthwest Moscow.   Pierre Salinger, Kennedy's former press secretary, a conferenceparticipant and now an ABC correspondent, on Sunday quoted a topSoviet source as saying in a private conversation that on Oct. 27,1962, Castro urged Khrushchev to immediately fire the missiles atthe United States to head off an invasion.   The New York Times had a similiar report on Monday, and quotedunnamed Americans as saying the report originated with SergeiKhruschev, son of the former Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev. Itsaid Sergei Khruschev subsequently denied making the comment.   The report that Castro had urged the use of nuclear weapons alsowas denied by Aleksandr I. Alekseyev, Soviet ambassador to Cuba in1962.   Soviets and Americans have met before to discuss the Sovietdeployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba and the U.S. response: ablockade of the island and a demand for the rockets' removal.   But this was the first joint meeting with Cuban officials whoguided their country through the crisis. Nikita Khrushcheveventually withdrew the missiles in exchange for President Kennedy'spledge not to invade Cuba.   At a news conference wrapping up the conference Sunday, McNamarasaid the figures on Cuba's war readiness and casualty estimate wereprovided by Jorge Risquet, a member of Cuba's ruling Politburo.   ``They say they had armed 270,000 men. They were determined tofight to the death of every man, and they believed there would be100,000 Cuban and Soviet casualties,'' McNamara told reporters.   It was not clear whether the 100,000 casualty estimate includeddeaths and injuries and whether it referred to losses among soldiersand civilians.   Other American officials said privately the Cubans had said thecasualty count could have reached 800,000. Cuba's population at thetime was 8 million.   McNamara said that of the troops, 40,000 were Soviet, four timeshigher than U.S. intelligence estimates at the time.   Risquet cited the figures to show his country seriously believedthat a U.S. invasion of his island was imminent. McNamara said nosuch invasion was ever contemplated, but speaking of the Cubans, headded: ``If I had been in their shoes, I would have believed thesame thing.''   American officials have said they were never sure whether anySoviet nuclear warheads had actually reached Cuba but that theyassumed they had.   Col. Gen. Dmitri A. Volkogonov, director of the DefenseMinistry's Institute of Military History, said that at the time ofthe crisis, 20 Soviet nuclear warheads were on Cuba. Another 20warheads were headed to the island aboard a Soviet ship that wascaught in the U.S. naval blockade, he said.   Volkogonov said he got the figures from military archives.   He made the remarks in a closed session of the conferenceSaturday, and they were reported to The Associated Press on Sundayby Raymond Garthoff, a State Department official at the time of thecrisis.   Garthoff, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution inWashington, said Volkogonov reported 20 nuclear missiles were onSoviet territory targeted at the United States.   The total stockpile of Soviet nuclear warheads designed to fireon the United States at that time was 60, Garthoff quoted Volkogonovas saying.   Soviet officials had previously been evasive about whethernuclear warheads had actually reached Cuba, according to Garthoff.   In his memoirs, however, Khrushchev implied that at the time ofthe crisis, the Soviets were ready to deliver a nuclear strike fromCuba.   At Sunday's news conference, the Soviet ambassador to Washingtonduring the crisis, Anatoly F. Dobrynin, said he didn't know at thetime that Soviet warheads were already on Cuba.   Volkogonov said the warheads were not ready for firing, andViktor G. Komplektov, a deputy Soviet foreign minister, said theirpresence on Cuba did not mean they would be put on launchers inpreparation for a nuclear strike.   ``At no time, not before, not during the beginning of the crisis,or in the most acute moments of the crisis, neither from the Sovietcommand there in Cuba nor in Moscow was there, or could there havebeen an order to mount nuclear warheads on the missiles,''Komplektov told reporters. He said ``not one'' of the missiles wasready and targeted at the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
