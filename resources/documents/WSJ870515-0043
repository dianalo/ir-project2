KarrStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LATAM </IN><TEXT>   Puerto Rico's Occupational Safety and Health Office proposed fines totaling $527,400 against the Dupont Plaza Hotel and Casino in San Juan, stemming from the fire there last New Year's Eve that killed 97 persons and injured 146.    The agency cited the hotel for 28 alleged violations of the commonwealth's safety and health standards. The penalties are the largest and the number of citations the most ever proposed by a state or territory-run occupational safety and health agency, according to John Pendergrass, the head of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.    He said the Puerto Rico investigation, which was aided by OSHA experts, showed that the &quot;apparent violations contributed to the magnitude of this disaster.&quot; Puerto Rico is one of 25 states and territories authorized by OSHA to establish and enforce workplace safety and health standards, subject to federal approval and monitoring.    Dupont Plaza has 15 days to respond to the citations. After that, the Puerto Rican agency will decide the validity of the citations and levy any fines it considers appropriate.    Wendell H. Gauthier, chairman of the Plaintiffs Steering Committee, made up of nine lawyers representing plaintiffs in the fire case, noted that the fines levied by OSHA after the MGM Grand Hotel fire in Las Vegas in 1980 totaled only $82,000. Many of the victims of the Dupont Plaza fire were hotel employees.    &quot;It tells me that OSHA found that this place was in horrible condition for employees, much less guests. This place wasn't even safe to work in,&quot; Mr. Gauthier said.    Mr. Gauthier also said that by law the OSHA fines cannot be covered by insurance, but must be paid by the hotel owners themselves. Dupont Plaza officials could not be reached for comment, nor could the hotel's attorney, James Fetterley, in Minneapolis.    In April, three hotel employees pleaded guilty to federal arson charges linked to the fire, and one of the three employees pleaded guilty to first-degree murder.    The Puerto Rican safety agency cited the hotel for violations including inadequate or locked exits, blocked passageways, and failure to train employees in emergency action or fire-prevention plans. The hotel lacked complete water-sprinkler systems, smoke detectors and alarms, fire walls and functioning fire-alarm systems, the agency said. </TEXT></DOC>
