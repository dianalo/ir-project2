By merging, Sky Television, owned by Rupert Murdoch, andBritish Satellite Broadcasting Ltd., owned by a group ofinvestors, are jointly shouldering a risk they could nolonger bear separately.</LP><TEXT>   The 50-50 transaction, announced in November, takes someof the burden off Mr. Murdoch's global media empire, whoseprofit has been dragged down by Sky's weekly losses of #2million ($3.9 million). British Satellite was losing evenmore.   The companies will be sharing access to 1.8 million ofBritain's 22 million homes and eliminating expensivecompetitive advertising as well as overhead costs.   &quot;There weren't enough subscribers coming forward tosupport both channels. A lot of the resistance to satellitetelevision in the United Kingdom was because there was aconsiderable amount of confusion about just what was beingoffered,&quot; said Derek Brock, an analyst with Nomura ResearchInstitute. &quot;But now that they are faced with a single option,I think you will see a much faster take-up.&quot;   The merged company is facing a recession and shrinkingadvertising expenditure. Total British ad spending in thefourth quarter of 1990 fell 8% to #1.2 billion from a yearearlier, the Advertising Association says.   British television audiences also have shrunk -- andcompetition might be stiffened by a new satellite-TVcompetitor and a new, fifth land-based channel.   In November, the daily hours of regular television watchedby Britons fell 10% to 3.54 hours from 3.95 hours five yearsearlier, according to AGB Television, a research company. Andsatellite TV accounted for 35% of total viewership in theweek of Nov. 11, according to RSMB TV Research.   The merger has its critics, including those who oppose thecreation of a satellite-TV monopoly. Some also oppose givingMr. Murdoch that much control over British television andnewspapers.   Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, wrote in anarticle in the Evening Standard: &quot;Of course monopolies arealways cheaper than competition. It is cheaper to run fivechannels without the costs of competition than nine channelswith them. And the new company certainly has got a monopoly.&quot;   The merged company's strategy is to build a subscriptionbase large enough for fees to cover operating costs and thencommand significant ad rates above that, ANZ's Mr. Poveysaid. He added that the merged company needs two millionfull-paying movie-channel subscribers to break even. It's nothalfway there yet, he said, and the sign-up rate has slowed.&quot;The reported profit picture is going to be murky at best.&quot;   Sky, which was launched in February 1989, and BritishSatellite, which began operating in April, said they merged acombined investment of #1.25 billion.   Britain currently has four land-based channels. BBC1 andBBC2 are operated by state-supported British BroadcastingCorp. and are partly funded by an annual fee paid by viewers.The other two channels are independent commercial operationsdependent on ad revenue. Channel 5, a new land-basedcommercial channel, probably will begin broadcasting in themid-1990s.   Before the merger, Sky Television had four channels andBritish Satellite five. Remaining today are: Sky's fourchannels -- a 24-hour news channel, a sports channel, ageneral-entertainment channel and a subscription-moviechannel -- plus a British Satellite subscription-moviechannel.   Sky says more than a million of its dishes are in use.Another 600,000 British homes get Sky by cable. The mergedcompany will use Sky's Astra satellite after a two-yearperiod, during which both companies' satellites will be used.   Operating through Astra, owned by a Luxembourg consortium,exempts Mr. Murdoch from Britain's Broadcasting Act, a lawthat prohibits owners of national newspapers from owning morethan 20% of a TV company. Mr. Murdoch owns five Britishnewspapers that have a total of more than one-third ofBritain's daily and Sunday circulation.</TEXT></DOC>
