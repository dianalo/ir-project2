In a revised annual 10-year forecast, the North AmericanElectric Reliability Council cited pending changes in theClean Air Act as &quot;the most significant threat&quot; to reliabilityof electrical power.</LP><TEXT>   Michehl R. Gent, vice president of the council, said themain concern is that many electric-power companies will findit too expensive to meet new strict pollution-controlstandards and will be forced to close older facilities soonerthan planned. Such a development, Mr. Gent said, couldexacerbate the pressing power-supply situation in many partsof the country, particularly areas east of the MississippiRiver.   Already power companies have been forced to reduce voltagein the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern parts of the countrywhen demand exceeded available supplies during extreme coldor hot spells.   The Reliability Council, formed by utility companies andcomprising nine regional groups, attempts to provide along-range industry view of the nation's electric-powerneeds.   Even without stricter pollution-control legislation,however, the growing demand for electricity -- especially inpeak summer and winter periods -- has a lot of energy expertsworried. In its report released yesterday, the council, forexample, increased by 5% its estimates of peak utility demandfor 1997.   While energy experts say short-term power supplies shouldbe adequate, the long-term picture is less assuring. Althoughconceding that forecasting energy demand is tricky, thelatest study predicts that the U.S. will need an additional7,500 megawatts of power-generating capability in the 1990sif it wants to keep up with demand and provide reliableservice. That 7,500-megawatt figure is lower than the 13,000megawatts the council projected last year, but is stilldisturbing, says Mr. Gent. Officials said the figure declinedbecause of improved forecasting methods, rather than a dropin expected demand.   Nonetheless, electric utilities are continuing to slowdown construction of new facilities. The NERC's latest studyshows that construction isn't yet under way on 55% of the newgenerating capacity previously announced for the next 10years in the U.S. That gap is up from 41% last year and just30% two years ago. Thus, forecasters worry that there's morerisk that power mightn't be available when it is needed.   Some utility regulators are also worried about the impactof the new legislation. &quot;Everyone is in favor of clean air,&quot;says Cas Robinson, a member of the Georgia Public ServiceCommission. &quot;But is the public willing to pay for it?&quot;   Nancy Kete, a senior policy analyst at the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency, dismissed the notion thatthe Clean Air amendments will threaten the nation'selectric-power supplies. &quot;I don't think it's a well-foundedfear. The EPA is just as concerned as anybody aboutelectricity reliability. When it {the legislation} isexplained, they will realize it won't make a big differencein energy supply,&quot; she said.   Slowing the pace of adding capacity is the complicatedquestion of what type of fuel should be used to generateelectricity. At the moment, more than half of the nation'selectric power comes from coal-burning generators. Naturalgas, oil, nuclear energy and renewable energy sourcesgenerate the rest. But with growing environmental pressuresand fear of deeper dependence on foreign oil supplies, theutilities are left struggling to find economical andenvironmentally safe solutions.   In the past, electric utilities facing capacity cruncheshave been able to turn to their neighbors to buy extra power.Those days, however, may be numbered. As the strains oncapacity spread, experts say neighboring utilities may bemore reluctant to sell.</TEXT></DOC>
