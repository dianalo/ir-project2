Igor Kripovnov, first secretary at the Soviet Embassy inWashington, Alecsandr Zobkov, an assistant military attache, alsofrom Washington, and Vladimir Sadovnikov, identified only as arepresentative from Moscow, arrived by commercial jet, said CareyCavanaugh, a representative from the State Department's office ofSoviet Union Affairs.   The delegation is here ``just to get a general feel of the SaltLake area,'' he said. Three Americans are in the Soviet city ofVotkinsk for a simultaneous visit.   ``Both areas were identified on the Intermediate Nuclear Forcestreaty as areas where monitoring for the inspection of INF sitescould take place,'' Cavanaugh said.   Dave Porter, a spokesman for Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said thedelegation would tour the community of Magna, about 25 milessouthwest of Salt Lake City.   Magna, population 8,500, is a few miles from the HerculesBacchus West plant. As many as 30 Soviet inspectors may establish acompound near the plant if the Senate ratifies the INF treaty,signed Dec. 7 by President Reagan and Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev.   The treaty would eliminate all intermediate-range nuclearmissiles in both countries' arsenals.   The Soviets' proposed INF team would monitor Hercules, whichdeveloped motors for the Pershing II missiles which would be ,banned under the treaty.   Porter said the Soviet advance team would not be visitingHercules this week. ``They'll see the outer gate of Hercules, butwon't go in at all,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
