The steps, some of which will take effect immediately and others which still require White House approval, were designed to meet President Reagan's call for quicker processing of export licenses and for the elimination of restrictions on shipments of goods that wouldn't threaten U.S. security if they were to fall into Soviet hands.    Mr. Baldrige said that within a few weeks the department will begin exempting enterprises controlled by allied governments from the requirement they obtain licenses to buy strategically sensitive U.S. goods. He said the exemption later will be extended to &quot;reliable&quot; private companies in those countries.    The relaxation will apply to countries belonging to the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom. Members of the Paris-based Cocom, which includes Japan and 15 North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, are expected, in turn, to tighten their own export-control regulations to assure that the products don't wind up in the Soviet bloc.    Mr. Baldrige said the license-free privileges later will be extended to such neutral countries as Switzerland and Sweden if these countries establish &quot;adequate export control programs.&quot;    Mr. Baldrige said the U.S. also will ease its restrictions on exports from other countries of foreign-made products containing U.S. parts. The current restrictions, imposed as a condition on licenses allowing the shipment of the U.S. components, involve such products as foreign-made personal computers that use U.S. microprocessors.    Details of the new policy haven't been worked out, but aides to the commerce secretary said such &quot;extraterritorial restrictions&quot; in the future will be made toughest for exports to socialist countries, less stringent for those to neutral ones and easier still for shipments to other Cocom countries.    Mr. Baldrige also said the U.S. will completely eliminate export licensing requirements for &quot;low-level&quot; U.S. products destined for friendly, but non-allied countries. He didn't elaborate on the kind of products that would be involved, but it is understood that they could include many types of personal computers.    In addition, the commerce secretary proposed giving U.S. exporters the right to ship several kinds of products to China under single distribution licenses. Hundreds of U.S. companies already have such bulk licenses for shipments to allied countries.    Mr. Baldrige said these and other measures under White House review could reduce the Commerce Department's yearly caseload of 120,000 license applications by 20% and shorten the average license-processing time from 20 days to 14. President Reagan earlier had asked federal agencies to cut that time &quot;by at least a third.&quot;    Mr. Baldrige also proposed that the White House send Congress legislation setting a six-month deadline for his department to act on requests by U.S. producers to eliminate export controls on certain fairly common products for which foreign equivalents are available elsewhere. For highly advanced products destined for allied countries, the legislation would require the department to grant export licenses within 20 days.    In the past, requests for decontrol often have been tied up in quarrels between the Commerce Department, the Pentagon and other agencies. Paul Freedenberg, assistant secretary of commerce for trade administration, said the proposed legislation would clarify that the Commerce Department could act without the approval of other agencies on such matters.    Mr. Baldrige said his legislative proposals could be included in a trade bill that the White House will submit to Congress on Feb. 19.    Richard Perle, assistant secretary of defense for international security policy, said the Pentagon would support many of these reforms if the Commerce Department musters enough &quot;resources and commitment&quot; to do a better job of managing the export-control system. In the past, the Pentagon has resisted relaxing export controls. </TEXT></DOC>
