As previously reported, federal authorities are investigating allegations that the firm's municipal-bond subsidiary made hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal payments to certain public officials to influence them to approve a number of questionable bond issues.    Matthews andamp; Wright also is under federal scrutiny to determine whether it concocted phony transactions in order to convince authorities the bond issues were sold before important tax-exemption deadlines, and whether projects to be financed by some of the firm's issues ever had a chance of being built, according to people familiar with the investigation.    Matthews andamp; Wright said it hired a &quot;special legal counsel,&quot; Williams andamp; Connolly, of Washington, to investigate the allegations, and that if any improprieties are found, &quot;management will take the appropriate steps to correct the situation.&quot;    Matthews andamp; Wright officials didn't elaborate. An employee reached at the firm's Wall Street headquarters said officials weren't available for further comment. </TEXT></DOC>
