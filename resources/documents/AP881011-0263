Trading was active Monday, analysts said, as Saudi Arabia, theworld's largest oil exporter, reaffirmed it would stick to itsproduction quota if other members of OPEC did.   The statement triggered speculation that other members of the13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries wouldreduce production in order to help boost prices.   But Nauman Barakat, vice president for energy investment atPrudential-Bache Securities Inc., said he remained skepticalbecause other OPEC members have ``shown no indication they arewilling to cut back output.''   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract forWest Texas Intermediate climbed 66 cents to settle at $13.60 abarrel. At one point during the day's trading, the contract tradedas high as $13.80 a barrel.   After opening lower today, prices retraced lost ground. Bymidday, the November crude contract was up 6 cents at $13.66 abarrel.   Crude oil prices had tumbled to around $12.30 a barrel last weekas Saudi Arabia threatened to produce more than its quota if theother OPEC members continued pumping more than their quotas.   Among refined oil products traded on the exchange, the Novembercontract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 1.28 cent to settleat 41.41 cents a gallon, while home heating oil rose 1.50 cents to38.96 cents a gallon.   Steven Chronowitz, director of futures research at Smith Barney,Harris Upham andamp; Co. Inc., said Monday's rise could mean pricesbottomed out last week.   But he said, ``if over the next few weeks we don't see any realaction to back up the words, then the market may sag again.''   Saudi Arabia delivered its affirmation about its willingness toabide by its quota if others did at the weekly Cabinet sessionpresided over by King Fahd and reported by Information Minister Alial-Shaer.   Prudential-Bache's Barakat said the Saudis have made similarstatements before, but that ``this statement is being taken moreseriously than before.''   He said one explanation is that a published report from theMideast said Saudi Arabia produced an average of 4.3 millionbarrels a day in the first week of October, matching its quota. Hesaid previously, the Saudis reportedly had been producing 5.7million barrels a day.   Barakat said the market was asking ``whether they have cut backoutput intentionally as an overture to others to cut back output oris it result of scheduling problems. That is the $64,000 question.''   He said trading was heavy and was driven by professionals buyingcontracts to cover borrowed contracts they sold earlier on theexpectation that prices would fall further.   ``The rally was a combination of technicals and fundamentals.People are still not giving too much credence to the Saudistatement,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
