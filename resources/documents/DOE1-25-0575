The specifications for thesemachines call for very low emittance (andless;10 nm-rad), and small beam divergences(large {beta}/sub x/) in long straight sections where undulator magnetsare placed. The dynamic behavior of the electron beams in such machinesis dominated by the strong sextuple fields that are required to reducethe chromaticities to zero. This in turn places contraints on the betatronoscillation frequencies, which must be tuned to be as far as possiblefrom third-order structure resonances. Together with the requirementfor small beam divergences in the insertion regions, these constraintsplace severe restrictions on the flexibility of the lattices. We showthat the double-focussing achromat structure, commomly known as the Chasman-Greenlattice, is particularly sensitive in this regard. Adding a third bendingmagnet within the achromatic arc section permits the lattice designerto tailor the phase advance across the arc section and the beta valuesin the insertion region whilst maintaining the optimum betatron oscillationfrequencies. The argument developed in this paper are illustrated instructures that are optimized for a 1.5-GeV third-generation synchrotronlight source.</TEXT></DOC>
