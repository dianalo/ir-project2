A government grant of #200 million for the latest year left the company with a #340 million loss to carry forward. The previous year's loss was fully covered by the government. British Coal, which the government plans to privatize, said it remains on course to break even in the current fiscal year.    STC PLC, a British telecommunications and computer company, said it plans to build an #18 million ($30.5 million) plant in the U.S. to manufacture optical-fiber cable. The plant initially will employ some 200 people and production is scheduled to begin by mid-1989. </TEXT></DOC>
