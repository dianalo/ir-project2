Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office issued a study of three different ways in which tax money could be raised over a five-year period by capping or eliminating mortgage deductions on residential loans.    One would limit the deduction to $12,000 on a single return or $20,000 on a joint return, generating about $10.3 billion in taxes over five years. The second calls for phasing out deductions for second homes, which the study says would generate $2.3 billion. The third would raise $55.6 billion by limiting a homeowner's deduction to 15% of the annual total mortgage interest.    The real-estate groups say that a cap on the deduction would be especially attractive to politicians because most voters pay less than $20,000 a year in such interest.    &quot;Very clearly, (legislators) have indicated several different ways the deduction could be attacked, but nobody wants to talk about it before November,&quot; says Robert B. Evans, president of the American Financial Services Association, a trade group representing financial concerns, some of which make residential mortgages. Other groups concerned about the deduction are the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders and the Mortgage Bankers Association.    House Ways and Means Committee staff members, however, say no proposals to change the deduction are being discussed. And Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential candidate and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has vowed his opposition to any tinkering with the write-off. -   Hotel Industry's Woes   Appear to Be Worsening   THE NUMBER of troubled hotels and motels is rising.    Though no one keeps statistics on hotel foreclosures, some people in the industry estimate that as many as 700 to 1,000 properties could end up in foreclosure between now and the end of 1990. Since 1980, 300 to 350 properties annually are estimated to have either gone into foreclosure or otherwise closed because of financial troubles.    One measure of the industry's difficulties is the number of hotels seeking help to improve their financial performance. High Country Corp., a Denver hotel-management concern, is working to turn around 30 foreclosed or distressed properties, compared with 15 a year ago. Lodging Unlimited Inc., a West Chester, Pa., firm that works with troubled hotels and motels, says that since May, it's been getting an average of 30 calls a month from potential customers, compared with three or four a month last year.    &quot;There is no question that we're going through a period . . . that will lead to an increase in foreclosures,&quot; says Saul F. Leonard, a Laventhol andamp; Horwath partner and lodging specialist.    Overbuilding in recent years has hurt the industry. The problems have been exacerbated by a lack of hotel-management experience at the troubled properties, says Morris Lasky, president of Lodging Unlimited.    None of this is good news for investors who funneled cash into now-troubled properties. If the property is sold at a loss, investors have to repay part or all of any tax write-offs they received.    Detroit Suburb Sells   Homes to Poor for $1   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich., can be added to a growing list of cities trying innovative ways to provide affordable housing for the poor: The city this month started selling houses for $1 to low-income residents.    Under the program, which mostly uses state funds, the Detroit suburb will loan $10,000 for each house to repair any plumbing, wiring or structural deficiencies. Residents must live in and maintain the house for five years, paying all taxes and utilities (To qualify, they must show an ability to pay about $150 a month in insurance and utility bills). Five years later, the loan is forgiven, and the resident owns the home.    The project also will expand the city's property-tax base, which has deteriorated in recent years as the city assumed more houses from landlords who failed to pay taxes.    Caroline Thomas, one of the new homeowners under the program, says she now will be able to make her own repairs as they are needed rather than &quot;begging the landlord&quot; to do it. The unemployed, 30-year-old mother of two says she plans to replace plumbing and wiring and repair a porch with her $10,000 loan.    The pilot program began with five houses, but a Highland Park spokesman says the city has 100 homes to use in the program, if it gets enough funding.    Apartment Vacancies   Declining in Some Cities   THE APARTMENT industry saw its nationwide vacancy rate swell to a record 11.8% in the second quarter, from 11.3% in the previous quarter. But city by city, the second-quarter figures hold some good news.    In Houston, the vacancy rate fell in the second-quarter to 18%, from 18.3% at year end and 18.5% a year ago. Jacksonville, Fla., which peaked at 16% at year end, declined to 14% in the second quarter. Denver's vacancy rate for the second quarter dropped to 11.5% from 12.1% at year end and 12.5% a year earlier.    &quot;Very slowly, vacancies are improving,&quot; says Robert Sheehan, economist for the National Apartment Association. He expects the national rate to start declining in the third quarter.    Multifamily construction has been slowing since 1985, and little additional construction is planned by the industry. &quot;A lot of the big apartment companies have been very careful about expansion,&quot; says Mr. Sheehan. </TEXT></DOC>
