The PTS consists of a transfer devicewhich is a rigid structure that protects its occupants and survives verticaldrops and lateral impact and a guiding system designed to reduce therelative motion between the transfer device and the standby vessel. Thispaper presents the results of an offshore testing program carried outin August 1987 to evaluate the performance of the personnel transfersystem (PTS) during transfers between the Bow Drill III drill rig andthe Trinity Bay standby vessel that was operating on the Grand Banksof Newfoundland.</TEXT></DOC>
