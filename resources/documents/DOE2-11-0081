It entailed theoperation of fixed-route feeder services through three low-density neighborhoodsand one industrial park, connecting them to the public bus system. Thesefeeder services, called the Neighborhood Shuttle, were operated by privatesuppliers, who were selected by competitive bid on a route-by-route basis,under contract to the transit authority. The private contractors operateda total of five to ten passenger vehicles along the system of shuttleroutes. A grant received from the U.S. Department of Transportation underits Service and Methods Demonstration Program funded the project. NeighborhoodShuttle service was implemented as a low-cost way to provide minimaltransit service to low-demand, low-density areas. Based on availableinformation, it would appear that privately contracted shuttle serviceis less costly to operate than conventional MATA fixed-route bus on atotal cost basis, but more expensive on a cost per passenger basis.</TEXT></DOC>
