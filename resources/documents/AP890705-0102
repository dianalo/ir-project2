U.S. District Judge John D. Holschuh said he would not make adecision on moving the case to federal court until at least July 17.Holschuh gave baseball's lawyers until July 12 to file papers andRose's lawyers until July 17 to file their response.   The ruling indefinitely postpones a hearing scheduled forThursday by Common Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel in Cincinnati for apreliminary injunction.   Baseball's lawyers asked the federal courts on Monday to take thecase from Nadel, who has given Rose a temporary restraining orderthat prevents Giamatti from deciding the manager's fate.   Rose's lawyers filed papers in federal court here earlier todayto block Baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti from moving thecase to federal court.   Giamatti is fighting for the right to hold a disciplinary hearingon charges Rose bet on his own team _ an offense that could get theCincinnati Reds manager banned from the game for life.   Rose's lawyers told Holschuh there were no legal grounds to movethe case of the state court system. They accused baseball of seeking``a third courtroom in which to vindicate themselves or at leastfree the way to boot Pete Rose out of baseball without a fairhearing before an impartial decision-maker.''   Baseball's request was filed in federal court in Cincinnati,which transferred it to Columbus to avoid any appearance ofimpropriety in the Reds' hometown, where Rose is a hero.   The question of which court gets to handle Rose's lawsuit couldbe pivotal. Federal courts repeatedly have upheld the sweepingpowers of the baseball commissioner, while Nadel has shown awillingness to go into what he described as ``uncharted waters.''   ``Federal courts are much more aware of the needs of baseball andmuch more willing to accept the authority of baseball and thecommissioner,'' baseball lawyer Louis Hoynes Jr. said.   Nadel's order blocks Giamatti from holding a disciplinaryhearing. Nadel said there was evidence Giamatti had already made uphis mind that Rose is guilty. Giamatti denies that.   Baseball's lawyers then turned to a state appeals court inCincinnati, which concluded it had no right to intervene.   The next step was federal court, although two federal judges inCincinnati said they had ``substantial doubt'' whether the caselegally could be moved to federal court.</TEXT></DOC>
