(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Coker Electronics' tPOST administers a telecommunications network that canconnect a far-flung empire through public phone lines.andP;  Using tPOST, branchand field offices can easily transfer files and exchange data with the homeoffice or with each other.andM;The tPOST system consists of two main software components: PC-tPOST is afile-creation and telecommunications module; tPOST Central is a centralmessage-handling facility that includes all the features of PC-tPOST.andO;Configured for 100 nodes running tPOST and one central facility using tPOSTCentral, this unattended file transfer program and host mail collection anddistribution system lists at $8,129.andP;  For an additional $49 per node, you canadd tPOST Forms, a utility for electronic forms processing.andP;  tPOST can alsosend purchase orders to your supplier's fax machines through an optional($129 per node) fax utility.andM;PC-tPOST and tPOST Central are not RAM-resident programs.andP;  However, sinceboth really need to be operating full-time in the background to receive andtransmit the appropriate messages and files, you'll need multitaskingsoftware like SoftLogic Solutions' DoubleDOS or Quarterdeck Office Systems'DESQview.andP;  I tested tPOST with DESQview, Version 2.25, and found noinstallation or operation problems.andM;A WAY TO COMMUNICATEandM;tPOST is a snap to operate.andP;  The menus are clear and straightforward, adefinite help for the novice user.andP;  Unfortunately, there is no way for themore experienced user to speed up his tasks by bypassing some of these menus.andM;tPOST can be configured as either a private or public mailbox.andP;  A uniqueaccess ID is assigned to each private network mailbox.andP;  In a public network,tPOST accepts all incoming mail in a common area.andP;  In addition, tPOST sportsa password-protected e-mail bulletin board.andM;tPOST makes it a breeze to compose, address, send, receive, and manage youre-mail.andP;  Messages can be composed with tPOST's built-in editor or your ownword processor.andP;  Addressees are selected individually from a phone directorylist or in groups contained in distribution lists.andP;  Deliveries can bescheduled for any time-day or night-or left unscheduled.andP;  An activity log andincoming and outgoing mail are stored on-disk.andM;One of the pluses of the tPOST system is that you can transmit a single fileto tPOST Central for subsequent distribution to multiple parties.andP;  You canalso transfer text or binary files between any two tPOST stations forpoint-to-point delivery, or to tPOST Central for storage and remote mailcollection.andM;Remote callers can deposit and automatically retrieve mail in a single call.andO;A polling-mail collection option lets them request delivery of stored mail byreturn call to their preauthorized phone number.andP;  This feature is adata-security enhancement welcome to those users who store proprietary orsensitive mail.andM;Other features include batch mail processing in one phone call andcall-limiting The latter lets you specify the number of times the systemshould attempt to deliver the information to you before letting you know it'sgiving up, pending further instructions.andM;CENTRALIZED MESSAGE HANDLINGandM;Incoming mail addressed to a host distribution list (stored in tPOST Central)is automatically distributed to addressees.andP;  This system gives all usersup-to-date, centrally maintained distribution mailing lists while providingan efficient store-and-forward e-mail system.andM;tPOST Central's automated mail management provides a versatile applicationinterface, allowing the user to custom-program special functions.andP;  Users canwrite their own collection of mailbox-maintenance utilities or use DOS batchfiles; tPOST Central will periodically run these, automatically andunattended.andM;Large networks consisting of regional tPOST Centrals can be installed.andP;  Thissetup can speed delivery and reduce long-distance phone charges-onemessage/file can be delivered to all selected tPOST stations by sending it toone regional tPOST Central, which then forwards it to other tPOST Centralsfor local distribution.andM;FORMS PROCESSINGandM;tPOST Forms lets you design and complete business forms for any applicationand allows you to fill in stored business forms.andP;  After completion, theseforms can easily be transmitted via tPOST to a central location forsubsequent processing.andP;  Data can be exported from completed forms tospreadsheet and database applications such as Lotus 1-2-3 or DBASE.andM;The combination of PC-tPOST and the tPOST Forms package offers automated datacollection from remote sites for analysis and computation at a centrallocation.andP;  However, one problem that may occur is in the naming oftransferred files.andP;  All files, whether e-mail or file transfers, gain a newname at the reception site in the form of MAILnnnn.IN (nnnn ranges from 0001to 9999).andP;  An extra-cost utility can properly label transmitted files withthe same filenames they had at the transmitting site.andM;INSTALLATIONandM;The tPOST software installs in the time it takes to copy a floppy disk toyour hard disk, and the reference manuals are comprehensive enough for eventhe most novice user.andP;  Especially worthwhile are the installation tips forDoubleDOS and DESQview.andM;Coker Electronics offers a 30-day money-back guarantee and free technicalsupport for 120 days from the purchase date.andP;  Extended support is availablethrough a purchase plan or by the hour.andP;  And unofficial tPOST user's groupssharing ideas, problems, and solutions are spread throughout the country (thecompany can help you find groups in your area).andM;If you have several locations you want to link up to share data andinformation, you'll find tPOST a relatively inexpensive and very effectivechoice.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
