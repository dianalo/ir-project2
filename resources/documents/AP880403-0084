Juan Ponce Enrile on Sunday but failed tofind the leader of an August coup attempt who fled his prison ship,the military said.   A Manila paper, meanwhile, reported that nine other officersbelieved to be involved in past coup attempts had fled a detentioncenter on Saturday. The report could not be confirmed.   The raid on Enrile's house in Batangas province, southwest ofManila, was part of as nationwide search for former Lt. Col.Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, leader of the Aug. 28 coup attemptthat nearly toppled the Aquino government, said military officials.   Honasan, 39, escaped from a prison ship before dawn Saturdaywith 14 elite navy personnel who were supposed to be guarding him.He had been confined there since his arrest Dec. 9 for theattempted coup that left at least 53 people dead and hundredswounded.   President Corazon Aquino, who had refused to grant amnesty toHonasan, warned soldiers and civilians not to aid the charismaticformer colonel, who is popular among many in the 160,000-memberarmed forces.   Honasan served as chief of security at the defense ministry whenEnrile was defense chief. Enrile told reporters Sunday he had notheard from Honasan since the escape.   ``I'm beginning to sense that they treat me as an enemy,'' saidEnrile, who was fired in November 1986, after an alleged coupattempt by his followers. ``Why don't they say it openly andpublicly?''   Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa ordered a nationwide alertin the wake of Honasan's escape and warned that leftist andrightist extremists may try to exploit the confusion created by theformer colonel's dramatic flight.   Trucks blocked all entrances to military garrisons in thecapital, and troops refused to allow reporters and other civiliansto enter the compounds.   Police set up checkpoints on the outskirts of Manila and placedhomes of Honasan's friends and associates under surveillance. Extratroops were deployed around the presidential palace.   De Villa also ordered troops on alert in central and southernPhilippine islands in case disgruntled officers and politicians tryto exploit the volatile situation in Manila and stage attacksagainst government installations.   The Philippine Daily Inquirer reported Monday that nine othersoldiers held in connection with coup attempts last August and inJanuary 1987 had fled the detention center at Manila's Villamor AirBase early Saturday. The report could not be immediately confirmed.   The newspaper quoted an unidentified air force officer asconfirming the escape. The newspaper said the Villamor incidentstrengthened speculation that Honasan's escape was part of a broadconspiracy within the armed forces.   Manila newspapers also reported leaflets were circulating inmilitary camps calling for the overthrow of the government. Theleaflets allegedly were from Honasan's Reform the Armed ForcesMovement, the papers said.   Meanwhile, investigators said Honasan and the others apparentlyfled the prison ship aboard rubber dinghies and came ashore nearthe Folk Arts Center, a few hundred meters from the headquarters ofthe Philippine navy.   They then boarded seven cars which had been waiting for them,investigators said.   The Philippine Daily Globe reported Monday that Honasan leftbehind a note when he fled the ship saying he was escaping because``the struggle for a better AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines)must go on.''   Honasan played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986,civilian-military uprising that toppled President Ferdinand Marcosand brought Mrs. Aquino to power. But he later accused Mrs. Aquinoof weak and inept leadership in the face of the communistinsurgency.</TEXT></DOC>
