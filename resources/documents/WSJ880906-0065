Metals dealers say increased demand for these metals is coming from both heavy and light manufacturing, especially the electronics and electrical industries, and has created shortages of some metals. They say that this, in turn, is raising fears about the potential impact of any further sanctions against South Africa, a major producer of all these vital commodities.    Since their low points of the past three years, prices of rhodium have surged by 300%, platinum by 123%, vanadium by 130%, chromium by 100%, palladium by 33% and manganese by 26%.    Price increases of several metals, notably vanadium and chrome, were marked in the past six months, dealers say.    &quot;Stocks {supplies} have fallen sharply and consumers were taken by surprise,&quot; says Gavin Sanderson, managing director of China Industrial Resources Ltd., a metals concern that trades metal on behalf of China.    Metals mainly produced in South Africa and the Soviet Union are regarded as &quot;critical&quot; or &quot;strategic&quot; because they are vital for industries ranging from steel and oil refining to automobile makers who need platinum, rhodium and palladium catalysts for legally mandated pollution-control systems.    Attention is focused on South African production because the U.S. House of Representatives last month voted in favor of more-stringent sanctions against South Africa, dealers say. The language of the bill, which still needs to clear the Senate, excludes a ban on imports of any &quot;strategic mineral&quot; that the president believes is &quot;essential for the economy, public health or defense of the U.S.&quot; and isn't &quot;available from alternative reliable suppliers.&quot;    However, &quot;price increases and sudden shortages of the metals have made the market aware of the possible impact of sanctions,&quot; says Oscar Prager, managing director of Ayrton andamp; Partners Ltd., metals merchants.    Market participants are uncertain whether a Dukakis administration would impose a ban on some of the metals, he says. It is also feasible that the South African government could retaliate selectively, he says. It could reduce supplies of vital metals that account for only a small proportion of the nation's exports, Mr. Prager says.    Some dealers claim that the South African government is already encouraging producers to lower supplies of critical metals. Thus, prices of vanadium, which is used to increase the strength of iron and steel products, jet engines and aircraft frames, have soared in the past six months, they contend, mainly because South African producers have withheld production from the market.    &quot;That is absolute nonsense,&quot; says John Hall managing director of Highveld Steel andamp; Vanadium Corp., Witbank, South Africa. &quot;We are a member of Anglo American Corp., a politically liberal company that is independent of the government,&quot; he says. In a telephone interview, however, Mr. Hall said sanctions were having an indirect impact on supplies.    For example, about 70% of Highveld Steel's vanadium is a byproduct of the refinery's steel output, he said. The U.S., European Economic Community and Japan have barred imports of South African steel, he said. With less steel to sell, the company's vanadium supplies slumped.    &quot;We are a commercial organization,&quot; Mr. Hall said. &quot;If we had anticipated the sharp increase in demand we would have built up stocks and would have sold more vanadium.&quot;    South African chromium producers also haven't been able to meet demand because of a surge in orders from the stainless-steel industry, dealers say. That shortage didn't come about because of sanctions. The mining industry didn't anticipate the stainless-steel boom, especially in Japan, dealers say.    Meanwhile U.S. industries have begun seeking alternative supplies of the metals from the Soviet Union, the second-biggest producer. &quot;Rhodium, platinum and chrome ore imports from the Soviet Union have risen by several multiples,&quot; says John Dewey, trading director of London-based Strategic Metals Corp., London.    Another alternative source of supplies is the U.S. strategic stockpile, Mr. Dewey says. Yet stocks of these metals are so &quot;old,&quot; he says, that a large proportion of the metals would have to be reprocessed.    Any embargo on key metals from South Africa would cost the U.S. around $9.3 billion, according to U.S. Bureau of Mines estimates. Yet some metals producers say that's clearly an understatement. They anticipate that consumers would scramble for scarce stocks, and price increases would exceed expectations, says Mr. Hall of Highveld Steel.    Looking ahead to U.S. commodities this week:   Copper -   The copper industry enters the post-Labor Day period amid concern over whether an autumn seasonal surge in demand will materialize this year.    Purchases of copper typically rise 8% in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, according to Fred Demler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York. But no one is sure whether this fall will be typical, primarily because the summer season clearly wasn't. Purchases of copper held up unexpectedly well during the summer, when major consumers, such as brass, rod and wire mills usually slow their production. Instead, this summer, mills reportedly ordered copper ahead, partly to assure themselves supplies to year end and to protect against price increases.    This summer's demand also reflected the relatively strong pace of overall economic activity during the period. Indeed, the only major copper user that lagged behind badly during the summer was the construction industry, dealers and analysts say. The result has been that copper prices -- which surged to a record $1.46 at the end of last year, then fell back below $1 -- were marching up again last month. The December futures price rose to a life-of-contract high of $1.0150 late in the month from as low as 86 cents at the beginning of August.    But the price sank late last week as concern built over rising interest rates, which make inventories more expensive to finance, and a possible slowdown in the economy. For instance, some dealers reported a sudden slump in demand during the middle of last week after the government reported a decline in the leading economic indicators. On Thursday, the December contract skidded 2.20 cents to 98.80 cents a pound; on Friday, it fell 0.30 cent to 98.50 cents.    Still, global inventories remain relatively low. Recent statistics from the American Bureau of Metal Statistics show there's been no significant increase in output, partly thanks to the recently ended month-long strike in Peru and a shorter strike in Canada. Also, signs are growing that China is resuming its place as a major copper buyer and importer. &quot;All in all,&quot; one analyst says, &quot;copper seems to have strong fundamentals through the end of the year&quot; -- provided the economy holds and interest rates don't ratchet up further. </TEXT></DOC>
