The investigation found that, at the present time, suppliesof plastic injection molding machines will be sufficient to meet anticipatedrequirements during a national security emergency. The Secretary, therefore,found that the machines were not being imported into the United Statesin such quantities or under such circumstances as to represent a threatto the national security, and recommended that the President take no actionto adjust imports under authority of section 232 of the Trade ExpansionAct of 1962, as amended. On February 17, 1989, the President announcedthat he accepted the Department's recommendation.In a February 17, 1989 statement, Secretary of Commerce Mosbacher recommendedthat a number of steps be taken to support the industry's ability to respondto current and future defense requirements. First, he directed the DOC'sNational Institute of Standards and Technology to cooperate with the injectionmolding industry to develop sensors and an improved engineering understandingof the injection molding process. This would help to evaluate and controlthe microstructure and production accuracies of injection molded partswhile still in the mold, increasing the industry's productivity and reliability.Next, he will be working with the Attorney General to identify measureswhich American industry, including the plastic injection molding industry,can take to strengthen its international competitiveness. Finally, he isrequesting that Defense Department officials meet with injection moldingindustry representatives to explore possible ways to support the industry'srevitalization efforts.The Executive Summary of Commerce's January 11, 1989, section 232 reportis reproduced below. A declassified version of the Commerce report willbe available for public review and duplication in the Bureau of ExportAdministration's Office of Security and Management Support, Room 4886,U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, (202) 377-2593.<ITAG tagnum="6">Paul Freedenberg,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Under Secretary for Export Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Summary</ITAG>BackgroundOn January 11, 1988, the Domestic Injection Molding Machinery Trade Groupof the Society of the Plastics Industry, (SPI) of Washington, DC, petitionedthe Department of Commerce (DOC) to conduct an investigation under Section232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, to determine the effectof imports of thermoplastic injection molding machines (PIMM) on the nationalsecurity.Under the statute, the President has authority to ``adjust imports'' basedon recommendations from the Secretary of Commerce. Under then-existinglaw, the DOC had one year in which to complete its investigation and forwardits report to the President. (Congress has recently amended the statuteto require that future investigations be completed within 270 days.)In its petition, the SPI asserted that ``import penetration has drasticallyendangered the health of the injection molding machinery industry . . .(and the) continued and uncontrolled importation (of injection moldingmachines) is a threat to the national security.''The Significance of PIMM's to National SecurityQuantifying defense use of injection molded plastic products is extremelydifficult. Many plastic parts may have military as well as commercial application,although military use may be minor relative to total peacetime consumption.One recent study found that the Department of Defense (DOD) is the largestsingle consumer of plastic parts (as it is for many industrial products),accounting for approximately four percent of the value of all parts consumed.Over one-third of DOD's consumption was of more sophisticated ``specialtyplastics,'' significantly higher than the three percent specialty plasticsconsumption in the economy as a whole. Injection molding machines are usedto manufacture defense and essential civilian products in much the sameratio as in the economy as a whole.Investigation MethodologyAvailable supply of PIMM's was determined by consideringandbullet; The ability of the domestic industry to expand production duringemergency conditions;andbullet; The ability to convert the existing stock of PIMM's from civilianto defense use;andbullet; Imports available from reliable sources; andandbullet; The ability to substitute other processes or products for injectionmolding.andbullet; The ability to convert the existing stock of PIMMs from civilianto defense use;andbullet; Imports available from reliable sources; andandbullet; An evaluation of industry economic trends to determine whetherit can be anticipated that the domestic production base will shrink, expand,or remain constant in the years ahead.Unlike previous Section 232 investigations (machine tools, bearings) requirements(demand) for PIMMs are not directly obtainable from the 1984 NSC StockpileStudy. In order to estimate national security requirements in a one yearmobilization period followed by one year of a major conventional conflict,the Department pursued the following approaches as the best means availableto analyze demand for parts manufactured by PIMMs:andbullet; Deriving PIMM requirements from Stockpile Study required outputsfor the more aggregate Special Industry Machinery category, and from thePlastic Materials category which includes PIMM feedstocks;andbullet; Estimating national security PIMM requirements by extrapolatingfrom data on annual consumption of plastic resins;andbullet; Conducting a series of focused interviews with PIMM users; andandbullet; Consulting with the Department of Defense to estimate future trendsin PIMM requirements expected to result from research and development andfrom projected weapon systems procurements.<ITAG tagnum="81">Step II</ITAG>If a supply shortfall is found, the Department then determines whetherimports have been a significant cause of the industry's inability to meetnational security requirements.Significant Industry TrendsIn order to determine the prospective production and technological capabilitiesof the domestic industry in the coming years, the Department evaluatedrecent trends that affect the industry's overall industrial competitiveness.Domestic shipments have varied significantly from year to year. Shipmentspeaked in 1984, fell sharply in 1985 and have been static through 1987.Employment has declined 11 percent since 1984. Employment of productionworkers has fallen 16 percent over the period, while the number of engineersincreased by 8 percent.Exports have been volatile, increasing since 1984 after bottoming out in1983 and 1984. The largest markets for U.S. exports have continued to beour neighbors in Canada and Mexico.Imports have increased dramatically since 1982, growing 700% by value and350% by units. Import penetration appears to have stabilized, however,thus far in 1988. Japan currently supplies over 55 percent of imports inboth unit and value terms, and has been responsibile for the overwhelmingmajority of increased import penetration in recent years.<ITAG tagnum="81">Competitiveness</ITAG>The domestic industry's competitiveness has deteriorated in recent years,particularly relative to Japanese manufacturers. There are encouragingsigns, however, that this trend has begun to reverse.Although quality and technical capabilities are believed to be the mostimportant factors considered by PIMM purchasers, recent devaluation ofthe dollar should allow U.S. builders to increase their price competitiveness.The petitioner alleges that dumping by foreign suppliers has limited U.S.producers' ability to benefit from exchange rate fluctuations.Recent introductions of new PIMM product lines by U.S. manufacturers havesuccessfully sought to replicate Japanese success with building ``standard''machines in large production runs. While the competitiveness of largerU.S. producers is expected to improve in the near to mid-term, smallerfirms are likely to either remain successful in niche markets or see continuingdeterioration.Supply Shortfall AnalysisUsing all the methods described above for determining defense requirementsfor PIMMs in a national emergency, no shortfalls in the availability ofPIMMs were found. U.S. producers have the ability to expand productionby about 100 percent within the one year of mobilization and one year ofwar, nearly meeting estimated defense requirements for PIMMs. When theapproximately 80,000 existing machines currently used in produce non-criticalitems and reliable imports are included in the available supply, estimateddefense requirements for PIMMs are easily met.FindingTherefore, we have determined that available supplies of plastic injectionmolding machines will be sufficient to meet anticipated requirements duringa national security emergency. The Department, therefore finds that plasticinjection molding machines are not being imported into the United Statesin such quantities or under such circumstances as to represent a threatto the national security.RecommendationThe Department recommends that the President take no action to adjust importsunder authority of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-7827 Filed 3-31-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3510-DT-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
