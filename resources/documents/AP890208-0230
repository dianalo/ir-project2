Three Palestinians were reported killed by army gunfire, and afourth was slain in a prison riot.   The surge of violence came a day after the U.S. State Departmentissued a report alleging the Israeli army's handling of the 14-monthPalestinian uprising ``led to a substantial increase in human rightsviolations'' in the occupied territories.   Wednesday's deaths raised to at least 378 the number ofPalestinians killed since the uprising began against Israeli rule inthe occupied territories. The Jewish settler was the 16th Israeli todie.   The firebomb struck the man's Peugeot near the West Banksettlement of Alfe Menashe, a Jewish enclave close to the Arabvillage of Qalqilya, the army said.   Israel radio quoted an Alfe Menashe resident as saying: ``Theauto was caught in traffic and ... a firebomb was thrown at the car.No one left the car.''   But the radio later said a preliminary police investigationrevealed no evidence of a firebombing, such as a broken bottle orshattered glass, though the car was badly burned.   The radio said police have doubts the car was firebombed, butgave no details on how the car caught fire. An army spokesman,speaking anonymously in line with army regulations, said the car didnot crash and that a report on the incident would be releasedThursday.   The driver, 38-year-old Albert Jerassi, who also lived at thesettlement, was killed, the radio said.   Settlers tried to converge on the scene, but army soldiersordered them away, the radio said. The army also clamped curfews onthree nearby Arab villages, apparently to aid searches for theattackers and to keep settlers from rampages.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told reporters: ``For the thirdtime, I think, people have been burned alive inside our country bythese rioters. ... Everybody should understand that we cannot standagainst this with empty hands.''   On Oct. 31, a mother her three young children died in a firebombattack near the biblical West Bank town of Jericho. A soldier whoattempted to save the family later died of complications from smokeinhalation.   In April 1987 a Jewish woman from Alfe Menashe died in a firebombattack on her car in the same area. Her son died later of wounds.   Hundreds of inmates rioted Wedesday inside the military prison atMegiddo, in northern Israel, after officials halted visitationsbecause relatives outside were throwing stones and raising bannedPalestinian flags, army officials said on condition of anonymity.   Prison director Col. Yehuda Saran told Israel Radio the mood inthe prison became tense, stones were thrown at guards and someinmates tried to escape over fences.   ``They (guards) first opened fire with rubber bullets, and thenopened fire with live ammunition when the prisoners began to try toescape and there was serious danger,'' Saran said.   Israel radio said the dead prisoner, whose name was not released,was from the West Bank town of Tulkarem and had been shot in thelower back.   However, an army spokesman said, ``he was not killed by an armybullet but had his skull broken.'' He said the army wasinvestigating.   Israel Radio estimated 1,300 people were involved in the fracas.Army sources said they included 150-200 Palestinian families outsidethe gates.   Saran told Israel radio he does not believe the incident wassparked by the State Department charges. ``Our treatment is veryhumanitarian, and I don't think the riot has anything to do with thereport,'' he said.   Israel's Foreign Ministry defended army activities in a 15-pageresponse, saying troops are forced to act because of``PLO-affiliated or Islamic fundamentalist radicals who have usedmassive stone barrages, firebombs, and even firearms against Jewsand Arabs.''   The army confirmed two Palestinians were fatally shot instone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops in the West Bank. Theywere identified as Jamal Salim Zakarni, 17, who was shot in thestomach, and Banam Gradat, 18, who died of a chest wound.   Arab hospital sources said an unidentified 20-year-oldPalestinian died from a plastic bullet wound to the head, suffered aday earlier in a clash in the Gaza Strip.   Merchants closed most shops and businesses in the occupiedterritories Wednesday in response to a strike call from thePalestine Liberation Organization-backed leadership of the uprising.A strike also was scheduled for Thursday to mark the start of the15th month of revolt.</TEXT></DOC>
