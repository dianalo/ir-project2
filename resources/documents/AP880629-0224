The Massachusetts Port Authority, the independent agency thatruns the airport, had announced the new fees in March to reduceairport congestion by encouraging small planes to use suburbanairfields.   ``The objectives of the airport to reduce delays are rationallyrelated to government interests,'' U.S. District Judge A. DavidMazzone said. ``I cannot say that the assignment (of the fees) wasan arbitrary, irrational, non-uniform assignment.''   Lawyers representing owners of small aircraft and commuterairlines said they had not decided whether to appeal.   The New England Legal Foundation, a non-profit organizationspecializing in government regulation of business, had argued thatthe fee increase violates laws requiring equal access to federallysupported airports. They also alleged the fees violateconstitutional guarantees against discrimination.   Wayne Henderson, a lawyer for the foundation, said he was``obviously disappointed ... but it's a close call as the judgesaid.''   The fees are based on a combination of airplanes' weight andother operating costs. While fees for large jets actually would godown, fliers of smaller aircraft would pay as much as 250 percentmore.   Under the new fees, all planes at Logan will be assessed an $88flat fee and 47 cents per 1,000 pounds. Currently, planes areassessed $1.31 per 1,000 pounds or $25, whichever is greater. Mostsmall planes pay $25.   The fee for a Boeing 747 would drop to $408 from $680, while aCessna 402 seating 10 passengers will pay $96 compared to thecurrent $25.   The legal foundation represented commuter airlines in the NewEngland area. Also appearing in court were lawyers for the NationalBusiness Aircraft Association and the Aircraft Owners and PilotsAssociation.   The landing fees were approved after a crowded, highly chargedhearing. Among those applauding the increase were residents livingnext to the airport, who see it as a way to reduce noise and thepotential for accidents.   Logan averages 90 takeoffs and landings an hour, according toMassPort. The Federal Aviation Administration ranks Logan among thenation's 10 most congested airports.   MassPort executive director David Davis called the decision aruling of national importance. ``It's a larger victory because thejudge supported the position of the authority's right'' to setfees, he said.   In a related development, the U.S. House on Tuesday removedprovisions in a $10.8 billion spending package for federaltransportation that might have blocked federal aid to Logan becauseof the new fees.   Opponents of the fee hike had inserted a provision to withholdmoney from Logan until the U.S. Transportation Department finishesinvestigating Massport's plan and the court ruled. The DOT reviewis not due until November.   The provision was deleted after Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II,D-Mass., complained it had no place in a spending bill. The billpassed the House and went to the Senate. Similar provisionsblocking aid to Logan remain in the Senate version.</TEXT></DOC>
