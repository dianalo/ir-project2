Despite Friday's stunning 3.9% plunge in the Dow JonesIndustrial Average to 2943.20, further declines lie ahead,asserts Heinrich Looser, Zurich-based head of private bankingat Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co. &quot;I'm looking for 2550 {on the Dow}before I'd get back in&quot; in a big way, the Swiss banker says.</LP><TEXT>   He adds that 2550 -- a crucial point on charts that manytraders and investors use to predict price movements --&quot;would also technically be a point where the market shouldfind a bottom.&quot; That would be 13% below Friday's close.   Gary P. Brinson, president and managing partner of BrinsonPartners in Chicago, declares that the &quot;U.S. stock marketwould have to come down another 12% to 15% before we wouldget to a level that is consistent with earnings in a normalrecovery.&quot;   Noting that the stock market is often regarded as aleading indicator of economic health, Mr. Brinson says, &quot;Itgot caught on Friday leading with its chin and really gotclipped.&quot; The problem, he adds, is that U.S. shares werebeing propelled upward by their own momentum rather thaneconomic factors.   Some money managers warn that Friday's negative sentimentabout U.S. shares could spread to other stock markets. Interms of local currency, several key overseas markets --including the British, French, Australian and Hong Kong --have nearly matched or outperformed U.S. stocks this year.Like the U.S., &quot;some other markets have also been propelledby their own momentum,&quot; says Mr. Brinson.   From their 12-month lows, British stocks are up 25%,according to the Morgan Stanley Capital Internationalindexes. French shares have risen 31.3%, Hong Kong 41.8%,Dutch 25.1% and Australian 42.6%. By comparison, the Dow atThursday's close had risen 24% from its 52-week low point.   Two big exceptions are the German and Japanese stockmarkets, which have risen only about 12% and 6%,respectively, this year, according to Morgan Stanley.Investors are worried about the German central bank'sdetermination to keep interest rates high enough to battleinflationary pressures associated with the high cost ofbailing out the former East Germany and excessive wagedemands. Higher interest rates increase the attraction ofbonds relative to stocks; they also can depress corporateearnings by slowing an economy and raising companies'financing costs.   In Japan, despite lower interest rates, the Tokyo stockmarket has fallen victim to financial scandals engulfingJapan's brokers and some of its largest banks. Despite ahalf-point cut in Japan's key discount rate last week,Japanese shares fell Thursday and Friday.   Japan's stock market -- the world's second largest afterthe U.S. -- &quot;is completely in a box,&quot; asserts Takashi Kiuchi,Tokyo-based chief economist for Long-Term Credit Bank ofJapan. He sees the Nikkei Index of 225 leading stocks on theTokyo Stock Exchange as trapped in a range of 22000 to26000-27000. It closed Friday at 24099.18.   &quot;For a while, there is no hope for prices to move abovethat range,&quot; says Mr. Kiuchi. &quot;At the top, a significantamount of selling pressure will occur,&quot; especially becausecorporate investors, having already lost big, are looking fora good opportunity to leave the market.   Some of the high-flying emerging markets could also be infor a breather. Last week, the head of one of Mexico'sbiggest brokerage houses conceded that in 1992, prices on theBolsa -- one of the world's best-performing stock markets indollar terms over the past seven years -- might not increaseas much as this year.   Stock analysts surveyed for the Institutional BrokersEstimate System run by Lynch, Jones andamp; Ryan predict thatprice-earnings ratios for nearly all major world stockmarkets will be lower next year than this. If that's becauseof corporate earnings increases, it may be good news forshareholders. If not, it implies that stock prices around theglobe have further to fall.   So, what do global-perspective money managers relish thesedays?   &quot;We are becoming more aggressive on bonds,&quot; says Mr.Looser of Bank Julius Baer. &quot;We aren't so optimistic onmacroeconomic developments, particularly in the U.S.,&quot; hesays, while &quot;Europe has some small growth.&quot;   At Bank Julius Baer, bonds normally make up 40%-50% of abalanced investment portfolio. But that share has recentlybeen increased. Mr. Looser says his bank is recommending that&quot;aggressive&quot; clients put 60% of their money in fixed-incomeinstruments, 35% in stocks and 5% in cash. For moreconservative investors, the bank suggests a portfolio mix of75% bonds, 20% stocks and 5% cash.   Brinson Partners in Chicago has similar thoughts. Threeweeks ago, the firm sold some overseas stocks and investedthe proceeds in foreign bonds. &quot;And because U.S. interestrates have come down so much, we moved some money from U.S.fixed-income markets to foreign fixed-income markets,&quot; Mr.Brinson says.   Usually a balanced global portfolio consists of two-thirdsstocks and one-third bonds. &quot;Today, it's the flip of that:We're two-thirds fixed income and one-third equity,&quot; says Mr.Brinson.   The reasoning behind the switch to bonds is a growingapprehension that the U.S. economic recovery will take a lotlonger to catch on and be less robust than initially hoped.In addition, many economists are lowering their growthestimates for other major industrial economies.   &quot;The recovery is going to be much further away than peopleimagine,&quot; says Alan Abel, a senior vice president at Bancadella Svizzera Italiana in Lugano, Switzerland. Therefore, hesays, &quot;I'd rather have something that gives me 8% {yield} forsure&quot; than stocks.   Stock markets, he believes, are too chancy right now.&quot;What's fueling equity markets are the prospects of lowerinterest rates, but also people are betting on a recovery. Ifthat recovery is further away than people expect andcorporate earnings are poor, they are going to bedisappointed,&quot; says Mr. Abel.   And even if there is a recovery, some money managers doubtstocks will rebound much. &quot;If the economic recovery comesalong nicely, stock prices will stay the same, because therecovery is already built into prices. If the recovery ismore lethargic, then stock prices will fall,&quot; says Mr.Brinson. Conclusion: &quot;Bonds offer a much safer bet.&quot;   Bonds aren't just a defensive play. The high real, orinflation-adjusted, interest rates prevailing in severalforeign bond markets &quot;leave some room for capital gains asglobal rates come down further,&quot; says Mr. Brinson. Because oftheir high real rates and low-inflation prospects, hisfavorite bond markets are Germany, the Netherlands, Franceand Canada.   Expecting a U.S. recovery, foreign investors purchased anet $10.4 billion of American stocks and $14.1 billion ofU.S. Treasury debt in this year's first half, compared withnet sales of $7 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, inthe first half of 1990. But it's unclear whether this heavybuying will continue. Over the summer, global money managerssignificantly reduced holdings of dollar-denominated bonds,according to an October survey by Merrill Lynch of 76 majorinstitutional investors in New York, Tokyo, London, Frankfurtand Paris.   &quot;Clearly, investors have shifted from having been heavilyoverweight the dollar in August to neutrally weighted now,&quot;says Michael R. Rosenberg, an international economist atMerrill Lynch. The survey also showed that the institutionsincreased their holdings of British and of &quot;Deutschemarkbloc&quot; bonds -- German, Dutch and Swiss -- after being heavilyunderweighted three months earlier.   The reduced appeal of U.S. bonds mirrors a decline in thedollar that began in early July. &quot;Most people were overweightthe dollar because they believed in a U.S. economicrecovery,&quot; Mr. Rosenberg says; &quot;and given the weakness in thedata, most investors now have thrown in the towel on thatscenario.&quot;   Analysts also say that Japan's institutions show littleeagerness to add to their already large holdings of U.S.bonds. An axiom of Japanese-U.S. capital flows holds thatwhen U.S. bond yields are 2.5 to 3 percentage points higherthan equivalent Japanese yields, Japanese investors becomebig buyers of Treasury securities. But &quot;starting with thesecond half of last year, that difference disappeared,&quot; saysMr. Kiuchi of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. Currently,10-year U.S. government bonds are yielding only about 1.5percentage points more than similar Japanese securities.   Not everyone is glum. For its balanced accounts,Citibank's private banking unit is maintaining a normalportfolio: two-thirds stocks and one-third bonds and cash.&quot;We find the equity markets attractive both in the U.S. andelsewhere on the basis of higher earnings in 1992,&quot; HenryB.W. de Vismes, head of international investment at the bigNew York bank's private banking unit, said before Friday'splunge.   One U.S. money manager notes that European investors havebeen bearish on the U.S. for some time. Many of them missedthis year's U.S. stock market rally and the dollar's 28% jumpfrom mid-February to early July, and hence now might be&quot;looking to prove themselves right.&quot;   Barton M. Biggs, director of global research andinvestment strategy at Morgan Stanley, expects &quot;weakness inall major {stock} markets around the world&quot; in the nearfuture. In both stocks and bonds, he likes Europe better thanthe U.S., partly because he thinks the dollar may weaken. IfEuropean stocks do tumble, he says, it would be a good timefor bargain-hunting in Germany, France and Scandinavia. Amongthe stocks he likes are Deutsche Bank, Siemens andMannesmann.</TEXT></DOC>
