Digressions ride roughshod over even the most thoughtful agenda, and perceptive comments are too often lost amid the jumble of words spilling over the conference table.    But they go anyway, because meetings are still the way organizations get their people to communicate, coordinate and collaborate.    Clearly, these people need help. They need some way to make meetings better and more productive. Enter the personal computer, which already has become the most useful tool for running meetings since Robert's Rules of Order.    With a small to medium-sized investment ($1,000 to $4,000) for a special projector, a personal computer can be turned into a large-screen &quot;intelligent chalkboard&quot; that can dramatically change the texture and effectiveness of a meeting.    At the typical computer-supported meeting, someone is designated to &quot;take notes&quot; on the computer as the participants talk. Key points made by the speakers are dutifully typed into the computer (and on the screen) as they talk. Everyone at the meeting hears -- and sees -- the discussion.    Something very subtle and important soon happens. People watching this flow of comments on the screen begin to say things like, &quot;Hey, this point relates to something that was said earlier,&quot; or &quot;Wait a second. Doesn't that contradict what you said 10 minutes ago? . . . Let's see.&quot; With the tap of a few keys, the screen scrolls back to the desired spot on this list of ideas.    Participants can instantly add to or alter these &quot;living minutes&quot; onscreen; they can use software to more formally structure a free-form discussion. They can rank the points that have been made and create links between relevant comments. Digressions become more obvious because you can see that they're not connected to anything. By contrast, the quiet but important points assume their rightful positions on this &quot;meetings map.&quot;    Similarly, a meeting can use the computer's power to check financial projections on a spreadsheet or change the graphic design of a report. You can't do this with a piece of chalk on a blackboard or a felt-tip pen on a transparency; they're simply too slow and cumbersome. The personal computer is the logical successor to these old-fashioned display tools.    The technology of computer-supported meetings offers another potentially appealing benefit. After the minutes have been edited onscreen, it's a simple matter to print them out. Hard copy is immediately available for anybody who needs to know what went on or wants to have a record of the meeting. In other words, the meeting has a product: a document. The words don't just float away into the ether after the meeting is adjourned. This can help shut down the &quot;But I thought we had agreed to . . .&quot; problems that occasionally surface weeks or months after the fact.    One intriguing sociological point: Participants meeting in this environment often pay more attention to the points displayed on the screen than to the individual making the point. What's on the screen is treated as a creation of the group -- not personal property. This technique apparently filters out some of the &quot;duelling egos&quot; mentality that infests too many meetings.    This concept of computer-aided meetings has begun to attract considerable attention from both industry and academe. Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center (whose research helped spawn the laser printer and Apple's Macintosh computer) has developed the &quot;Colab&quot; (from collaboration) room: Instead of using one computer to support a meeting, Colab gives each participant a computer and everyone shares a giant common screen. This state-of-the-art meeting room has changed how work gets done at Xerox's PARC.    &quot;We now make Colab jokes at non-Colab meetings,&quot; says Mark Stefik, the PARC scientist who oversees Colab. &quot;At outside meetings, people complain, 'Why aren't we doing this in Colab?'&quot;    And, of course, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have taken personal computer hardware and software and turned themselves into meetings consultants. Meeting Technologies of Berkeley, Calif., brings a trio of Macintosh computers around the country to its Fortune 500 clients; similarly, Computer-Enhanced Meetings' Bernard Dekoven in Palo Alto rents himself out as a &quot;tecretary&quot; to facilitate meetings for customers at Stanford University and Apple Computer.    There's simply no way to track how many impromptu computer-aided meetings take place -- but it's clear that something is going on out there.    For those who believe the cliche that a camel is a horse designed by a committee, it's reasonable to fear that computer-aided meetings will lead to the efficient production of bigger camels. The old computer cliche &quot;Garbage In, Garbage Out&quot; still holds.    However, in the hands of people who really want to make meetings more productive, the computer can be a provocative and useful tool. Anything that can make meetings less frustrating and less of a waste of time merits a serious look.    ---   Mr. Schrage is a senior editor at Manhattan Inc. and is writing a book on technology and the process of collaboration. </TEXT></DOC>
