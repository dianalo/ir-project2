The length of the loans will permit significantly lower monthly payments than otherwise available, although buyers will be required to post a hefty 25% down payment to qualify. Most car loans extend four or five years, although some currently go as long as seven.    Officials at Volvo's U.S. sales arm in Rockleigh, N.J., said their aim is to make Volvo's upscale cars more affordable to increasingly cost-conscious buyers. The effort is particularly important because sales fell 5.4% last year, the first year-to-year decline since 1978. Volvo Cars is a unit of AB Volvo, a Swedish auto maker.    &quot;We think with the economic conditions such as they are, we need to put our cars a little more in the reach of more buyers,&quot; said Fred Hammond, a Volvo U.S. spokesman.    Volvo is offering the long-term financing at its dealerships through Chase Manhattan Bank, a unit of Chase Manhattan Corp. The 11.75% interest rate on Volvo's 10-year loan in New York and New Jersey, for example, is lower than the 12.25% rate on 5-year loans in those markets.    But under terms of the new loan, buyers must first produce a 25% down payment. The normal minimum down payment on a car is 5% to 10%, although several banks -- including Chase Manhattan -- don't require any money down for many buyers. On a 740 GLE Volvo with a base price of $22,330, the 25% down payment would equal $5,583.    Still, the 10-year loan would carry a far lower monthly payment than a more typical loan. It would reduce the payment to $235.65 a month from $473.16 for a five-year loan with no down payment, Chase Manhattan officials said.    But even Volvo and Chase officials concede the long-term loan carries risks for consumers. &quot;It is conceivable that with a loan this long, the car may retire before the loan has,&quot; said Joel Epstein, senior vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank.    A recent R.L. Polk andamp; Co. study found the median age of cars on the road in 1986 was 7 years, up from 6.5 years in 1983. Individual figures for the life expectancy of Volvos weren't immediately available.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, AB Volvo's American depositary receipts closed at $50.625 each, up 50 cents.    It's unclear whether other auto makers will follow Volvo's move, partly because longer-term loans typically entail more risk of default.    The longest loan offered by General Motors Acceptance Corp., General Motors Corp.'s big finance unit, is five years. GMAC officials said competition from banks offering six-year and seven-year loans is forcing GMAC to consider lengthening its loans. But it is reluctant to do that.    &quot;Auto manufacturers have serious concerns that longer-termed loans take more car buyers out of the market,&quot; said a GMAC spokesman. &quot;If you have three-year loans, people are usually back in the market ready to buy something new in three years. With a 10-year loan, people may be tired of their old cars, but can't afford to get something else.&quot;    Volvo, however, insists that 10-year loans won't mean less-frequent purchases of its cars. The company said a survey of its buyers maintains they intend to keep their new cars at least 10 years. </TEXT></DOC>
