A major objective of these studies is to examine the riskof lung cancer relative to the specific activity of the radionuclide,rate of dose accumulation due to differences in solubilities of the radionuclides,and the presence of competing risk from extrapulmonary lesions. Dose-responserelationships were studied for the three groups of dogs, with analysesspecifically designed to evaluate differences in response. Based on estimatedcumulative dose to the lung, risks were found to differ significantlyamong the radionuclides; they were highest for {sup 239}Pu(NO{sub 3}){sub4} and lowest for {sup 238}PuO{sub 2}. A model in which the risk wasassumed to be a pure quadratic function of dose fit the data much betterthan a pure linear model. Currently, all three groups of dogs can becompared only to 10 years after exposure. However, it is apparent thatthe average cumulative dose to the lung may not be an adequate predictorof lung-cancer risk for different isotopic and physicochemical formsof plutonium. 13 refs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
