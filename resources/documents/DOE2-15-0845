Commercial grade items (CGIs) are typicallyused in safety-related applications in nuclear power plants. The safetyfunction of the CGI in safety-related assemblies may range from extremelyminor to critical. In general, the cost of the item is not related toits importance to the safety function of the assembly. Since all aspectsof the procurement and use of CGIs in safety-related applications arenot completely and clearly defined by existing regulations and standards,the results of the development of a guideline that contains the recommendedelements to accomplish the procurement and acceptance process is thesubject of this paper.</TEXT></DOC>
