The agreement would affect American sporting goods and leisureproducts, furniture, jewelry, processed foods and pet foods, whichtogether accounted for nearly $1.6 billion in exports to Japan lastyear.   Of the United States' $170 billion trade deficit in 1987, $60billion of the shortfall was with Japan. American government andbusiness officials have long complained that U.S. products are notallowed to compete fairly in Japan.   ``This is a first attempt to really penetrate the Japaneseconsumer market by getting access to consumers,'' CommerceSecretary C. William Verity said.   Verity and Japan's minister of international trade and industry,Hajime Tamura, announced the pact at a news conference and saidthey hoped that additional industries would soon be added to theinitiative. Verity said that officials from the two countries haddiscussed the eventual inclusion of about 20 products, includingmedical and computer equipment.   Under the agreement, trade officials from both countries willhelp American companies locate potential customers in Japan. Veritysaid he would soon meet with executives of the U.S. industriesinvolved to discuss the program.   Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry will helpremove obstacles that have hindered U.S. sales in Japan, theofficials said.   ``MITI will work with them in opening opportunities to get theproducts on the shelves,'' Verity said. ``In department stores, allproducts are Japanese.''   Japanese banks and trading companies will also try to spur salesof U.S. goods.   Verity and Tamura declined to estimate what effect the agreementwould have on sales of the American products in Japan. Theyacknowledged, however, that the initial results would not bedramatic.   ``We don't have flowers immediately when we try to sow theseeds,'' Tamura said through a translator. ``We have to sow theseeds first.''   Tamura said that Japan's international trade surplus, whichpeaked in 1986, has been dropping in recent months while domesticdemand has been growing sharply. He said that in the first fivemonths of this year, U.S. imports to Japan increased 43 percentover the same period in 1987.   ``Now is the best possible opportunity for market entries,'' hesaid.   ``The Japanese consumer is finally coming into his own,'' Veritysaid. ``For our part, we want the Japanese consumer to be able tobuy America's best.''   United States exports to Japan last year totaled $204 million insporting goods and leisure products, $34 million in furniture, $217million in jewelry, and $1.1 billion in processed foods and petfood.   This is the second trade agreement between the United States andJapan in a week. Last Monday, the two countries reached a tradepact that would result in large increases in U.S. imports of beefand citrus fruits to Japan by phasing out or reducing quotas andtariffs.</TEXT></DOC>
