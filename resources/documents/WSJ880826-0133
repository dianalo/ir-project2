Citing a number of biologists, Mr. Chase recommended active intervention to protect the important natural values of Yellowstone.    This summer, the policy of natural regulation has been a primary reason fires continue to rage despite substantial effort to contain them. So far, more than 330,000 acres of timberland in Yellowstone have been charred -- about 15% of the total area of Yellowstone and more than all the acreage burned by lightning fires in all the national parks between 1968 and 1982. Unless the hot and dry weather ends soon, we can expect the fires to continue. Such devastation may occur despite the millions of dollars ($33 million so far) being spent trying to stop the fires.    The situation is out of control, and residents in surrounding communities are asking why the Park Service isn't doing more to stop the advancing fires, which are now threatening homes and livelihoods. Says Yellowstone Park Superintendent Robert Barbee: &quot;People keep saying, 'Why don't you just put them out?' I have a difficult time convincing folks that you don't take a 60,000-, 70,000- or 80,000-acre fire and just put it out.&quot;    Two months ago, some of the larger, out-of-control fires were much smaller and could have been put out, but this would have violated Park Service policy. These fires, which were caused by lightning, are now sopping up resources that could be used to fight the other park fires that were caused by human activity. But according to park policy, such &quot;natural&quot; fires should be allowed to burn without containment efforts. Yet the hot and dry conditions in June indicated that such an approach was dangerous. Managers fully in charge of the park -- without the political constraints that inevitably characterize political management -- would have suppressed most of them. But the Park Service stuck to its guns and did virtually nothing.    The basic idea behind &quot;natural regulation&quot; is that nature, not man, should do the regulating. This policy reflects the views of influential leaders of the environmental movement -- the group that Mr. Chase calls the &quot;conservation elite.&quot; It became park policy with the adoption of the 1963 Leopold Report, which recommended that national parks should be maintained or even re-created in conditions &quot;as nearly as possible&quot; like those that existed when the white man first arrived.    The &quot;hands-off&quot; management of the park remains a revered principle in environmental circles. Last week Peter Berle, president of the National Audubon Society, told reporters in Billings, Mont., that he sees fires &quot;in general as part of a natural system&quot; -- even though he conceded he was taken aback by the intensity and smoke of the Yellowstone fires he saw as his airplane flew over them.    Fires do, of course, regenerate growth. A lot of the area in Yellowstone now being scorched was in bad need of clearing so that a natural progression of new plant growth could take place. Indeed, one reason the fires are so severe is that the Park Service's previous policy of suppressing natural fires allowed a lot of brush to build up.    But there are ways to accomplish this without creating a crisis. A visit to Pine Butte Preserve, an area in northwestern Montana owned by the Nature Conservancy, taught me that the benefits of fires can be obtained without endangering life and property. Pine Butte is the last lowland habitat of the grizzly bear in the lower 48 states, and the Nature Conservancy manages this 12,000-acre area in large part to preserve those bears. Among other steps such as planting chokecherries to restore riparian habitat and carrying out water projects to protect the preserve's wetlands, the managers of this privately owned preserve create fires.    But they conduct fire operations carefully. The weather conditions must be right, a contingency plan must be developed, preparations along the perimeter of the target area must be made, and the required manpower to maintain control must be available. Rather than being prisoners of ideology and politics, the Nature Conservancy concentrates on outcomes and is free to be pragmatic and adapt its policies to changing ecological conditions.    Like the managers in charge of Yellowstone, the Nature Conservancy has the objective of protecting the natural treasures of the area. But the Nature Conservancy owns those treasures; their own resources are at stake and no one else can be blamed. Sticking to a policy that caused harm would hurt their own reputations and destroy their own property -- while at Yellowstone, managers must follow policy set largely by an environmental elite that is not accountable for the results of stubbornly following an ideological course.    The Pine Butte approach could have been taken easily at Yellowstone Park, especially a few years ago, had managers been free to manage. Fires could have been set deliberately and carefully controlled. But this would have been politically dangerous. It would have challenged the viewpoint of the environmental elite, the important constituency that rallies support in Congress when the Park Service budget is threatened.    If the Yellowstone fires continue, and if controversy over the &quot;natural regulation&quot; policy is sufficiently severe to arouse public opinion, &quot;natural regulation&quot; may be curtailed. But in this instance, the price to the &quot;Crown Jewel&quot; of America's national parks may be very high.    ---   Mr. Leal is a research associate with the Political Economy Research Center in Bozeman, Mont. </TEXT></DOC>
