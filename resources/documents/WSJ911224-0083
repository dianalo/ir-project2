The Commerce Department said disposable, or after-tax,income fell an inflation-adjusted 0.5% in November afterrising a scant amount in October and September. Butconsumption grew 0.4% during the month after falling inOctober and growing only slightly in September. (Beforeadjusting for inflation, income fell 0.2% and spending rose0.7% in November.)</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The spending figures are a bit better than might beexpected if the collapse of consumer confidence is to bebelieved,&quot; said Norman Robertson, chief economist for MellonBank in Pittsburgh. &quot;Perhaps confidence is not as low as wethought.&quot;   But some analysts cautioned that the lack of income growthdoesn't bode well for retailers as the important holidayselling season draws to a close.   The drop reflected a large decrease in government subsidypayments to farmers after a hefty increase in October, theCommerce Department said. But even excluding that and otherspecial circumstances, income growth was a &quot;barelyperceptible&quot; 0.2%, Mr. Robertson said.   President Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, notedthat inflation-adjusted consumer spending &quot;fell early in theyear, then rose into the summer and has been relatively flatin recent months.&quot; He told reporters that in the view ofadministration economists, the new report &quot;reflects the flatand sluggish economy that we find ourselves in.&quot;   Consumers last month seemed willing to forgo some savingin order to buy goods and services. The savings rate ofAmericans was 4.7% in November, down from 5.5% the previousmonth.   All figures are adjusted for normal seasonal variations.   ---                      PERSONAL INCOME                                                                                                          Here is the Commerce Department's latest report onpersonal income.
