WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soviet inspectors arrived Monday tovisit a cruise missile base and a repair shop to check compliancewith the superpower treaty to remove ground-launched medium-rangenuclear missiles from Europe.   U.S. officials said the 20 Soviets on Tuesday will visitFlorennes air base, 40 miles south of here and a Belgian plant, 10miles north of Florennes, which the United States uses as a repairand maintenance shop for its European-based cruise missiles.   U.S. officials said the United States has deployed 20 cruisemissiles at Florennes and 55 cruise missiles and their launchcanisters are at the plant at Gosselies which belongs to Sabca, anaviation construction company.   The Soviet inspectors, led by Viacheslav S. Lyebedev, arrived atBrussels' Abelag airport and were welcomed by Belgian officials;U.S. Air Force Col. John Fer, head of the On-Site InspectionAgency's European field office at Rhein-Main Air Base in WestGermany; and his deputy, U.S. Army Lt. Col Scott G. Lang.   Under the U.S.-Soviet accord, the United States and the SovietUnion will remove all ground-launched nuclear missiles with a rangeof between 300 and 3,400 miles.   The treaty, which removes an entire class of nuclear arms, saidLyebedev, ``marks the beginning of an unprecedented stage in thehistory of mankind.''   ``We will perform our duties in strict compliance with theprovisions of the treaty,'' said Lyebedev, speaking through aninterpreter.   Fer said the inspections ``are serious business. It is a task weaccept with commitment.''   In recent weeks, Soviet inspectors have visited U.S. missilesites and related installations in Britain, West Germany, theNetherlands and the United States. Italy is the only Europeannation not yet visited by Soviet inspectors.   U.S. inspectors have already visited sites in the Soviet Union,East Germany and Czechoslovakia.   The Florennes air base houses the 485th U.S. Tactical MissileWing. Under NATO's 1979 decision to deploy 572 cruise andPershing-2 missiles in the five European nations, 48 cruisemissiles were to be based at Florennes.   The repair plant at Gosselies belongs to the Belgian firm ofSabca, a Belgiasn aviation construction firm, and does maintenanceand control checks on unarmed missiles from Belgium, West Germany,Britain, Italy and the Netherlands.   Under the treaty, the United States and the Soviet Union agreedto remove hundreds of ground-launched medium- and shorter-rangemissiles in a three-year period and not to produce or test suchweapons after that. The treaty also gives each party on-siteinspection rights for 13 years.   The treaty covers U.S. cruise, Pershing-1A and Pershing-2missiles and Soviet SS-20, SS-4, SS-5, SS-12 and SS-23 missiles.</TEXT></DOC>
