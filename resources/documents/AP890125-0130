Opposition leaders have demanded Takeshita's removal since KenHarada, the Economic Planning Agency director, resigned Tuesdaybecause of links to the Recruit Co. conglomerate, the companyinvolved.   Harada was appointed a month ago in a Cabinet realignmentintended to quiet complaints about the scandal, and had been chosento lead an investigation of financial connections between Recruitand politicians.   Earlier this month, Takeshita declared his new Cabinet free oftaint from the scandal, in which politicians and others were offeredadvance shares in a Recruit subsidiary and made huge profits whenthe stock went public.   Takeshita said in a television interview Wednesday the Haradaresignation ``reinforces my feeling that we need to do something. Wemust make efforts to dispel public distrust in government and in theparty.''   At a meeting with Japanese reporters, he said demands for hisresignation were ``a matter for me to judge.''   News reports said Harada received monthly political donations ofabout $80 from Recruit for 14 years until the end of 1987, wellafter the stock-trading scandal was revealed.   Recruit-Cosmos, the subsidiary, sold unlisted shares to more than150 influential politicians, journalists and businessmen.   Although the transactions were not illegal, the deal arousedsuspicions of bribery and influence-peddling. The result was apublic outcry over fund-raising practices and the traditionalcoziness between Japanese businessmen and politicians.   Harada, 69, was chosen for the new Cabinet the prime ministerappointed Dec. 27 in an attempt to restore the image of hisgovernment and his party, the conservative Liberal Democrats.   He said Tuesday, in resigning, that Recruit had not sought favorsfrom him and he had done nothing wrong. Koichiro Aino, also 69, wasappointed to replace him.   Justice Minister Takashi Hasegawa resigned after only three daysin office when it was disclosed that he continued receivingdonations from Recruit after the stock deal was exposed.   Kiichi Miyazawa, the finance minister, quit in December afterrepeatedly changing his story about an aide's purchase of shares inhis name.   Takeshita told Japanese reporters Wednesday that opposition callsfor him to resign were ``a matter for me to judge.''   The Japan Socialist Party, the largest opposition group, adopteda resolution at its annual convention Wednesday demandingparliamentary elections.   ``We're pretty sick of all this,'' Takako Doi, the partychairwoman, said in a television interview.   Several ranking current and former bureaucrats also have beenlinked to Recruit.   Kunio Takaishi, former deputy education minister, and TakashiKato, former deputy labor minister, bought shares in Recruit-Cosmos.Takaishi was forced to abandon his quest for a seat in Parliamentand prosecutors have questioned Kato several times.   Yoshiro Okai, the current deputy, and Masayuki Nomiyama, directorof the Labor Standards Bureau, acknowledged accepting dinners andgolf trips from Recruit. Labor Ministry officials both would quit atthe end of the month, but described the resignations as routine andunrelated to the scandal.   The ministry monitors and sets guidelines for the personnel andemployment-information fields, Recruit's main business, andprosecutors are investigating the possibility of bribery.   Since the scandal began last June, Takeshita has pledged to cleanup government, most recently saying in his New Year's speech hewould seek to revise election laws and rules for political donations.   Asked Wednesday how he would erase public distrust, he said: ``Iwill solve (problems) one by one.''   The prime minister is scheduled to visit Washington next week tomeet with President Bush.</TEXT></DOC>
