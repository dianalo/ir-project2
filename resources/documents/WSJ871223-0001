A walkout could have disrupted Christmas travel plans for thousands of passengers on the nation's third-largest airline.    American, a unit of AMR Corp., said details of the new six-year pact with the Association of Professional Flight Attendants wouldn't be released until next week. The airline described the new agreement as &quot;a single-scale, market-rate pay system in accordance with agreements reached previously&quot; with its pilots union. The pact was reached only hours before the flight attendants had threatened to start their walkout at 1 a.m. EST today.    Prospects for a settlement had seemed dim because both sides said they held little hope of settling the primary roadblock to a new agreement, American's two-tier wage scale, which pays flight attendants hired since 1983 significantly less than senior flight attendants. The union has been seeking to abolish the two-tier scale, but American hadn't yielded on the issue.    If the union had proceeded with the strike, it wasn't clear how many flight attendants would have supported the walkout. The union insisted support for the strike was strong, but American had predicted only about 10% of its 12,000 flight attendants would walk out.    American's flight attendants have been working under a new contract, which American unilaterally imposed June 1. The union has refused to ratify that contract.    Earlier, American had said in the event of a strike it would staff its flights using flight attendants who would have crossed the picket line, as well as retired flight attendants, supervisory personnel, ticket agents and reservation agents. It also said it was prepared to implement emergency work rules, which would have allowed it to staff flights with fewer attendants and make them work longer hours.    The union called the strike after receiving authorization from its membership in ballots counted Monday. It wouldn't say what percentage of flight attendants voted to grant the union the strike authorization. </TEXT></DOC>
