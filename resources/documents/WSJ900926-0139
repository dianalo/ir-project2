Gordon Crovitz</HL><DATE>09/26/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A17</SO><IN>SECURITIES (SCR)BOND MARKET NEWS (BON)LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)</IN><GV>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)</GV><LP>   Why should the end of the Michael Milken prosecution beany less bizarre than the initial outrage of RICOinginvestment bankers? Judge Kimba Wood is scheduled to sentenceMr. Milken on Monday, but first prosecutors want hearings onwhy she should jail Mr. Milken for crimes he did not admit.Prosecutors who originally sought a sentence of 520 yearshave decided the only &quot;trial&quot; they will risk is a sentencinghearing without niceties such as a jury or presumption ofinnocence.   If Judge Wood considers the government's arguments on asentence based on Mr. Milken's non-pleas, she must first holdhearings on whether the charges are likely true. Despitedue-process problems, courts sometimes allow Fatico hearings,named for Carmine Fatico. He pleaded guilty to hijackingtrucks; then a judge held a post-plea hearing on whether healso was a fully initiated member of the Gambino Mafia crimefamily.</LP><TEXT>   Judge Pierre Leval refused to hold Fatico hearings beforehe sentenced Robert Freeman. Mr. Freeman agreed to a pleabased on his &quot;Your Bunny has a good nose&quot; conversation. JudgeLeval refused to let prosecutors file a sentencing memoclaiming 20 other crimes, noting that &quot;the government had theopportunity to charge the defendant with those 20 crimes&quot; andthat he would be &quot;simply incapable of resolving thesedisputed issues.&quot;   Mr. Milken's prosecutors have a 215-page sentencing memothat tries to justify the original indictment on 98 countsincluding RICO and insider trading. Mr. Milken refused toadmit any racketeering or insider trading. The good news forMr. Milken is that the 129-page response from his lawyersreleased yesterday starts to clear the air about what he didand what he did not do:   -- Mr. Milken's lawyers note that prosecutors still accusehim of insider trading in several securities including Viacomand Lorimar. They say this is despite the evidence by thetraders involved, now the government's own witnesses, who saythe trades were legal and that they never discussed them withMr. Milken.   -- Prosecutors could not gather enough evidence linkingMr. Milken to allegedly illegal activities byPrinceton/Newport. The Milken memo notes that they want JudgeWood to &quot;assume&quot; that Mr. Milken was somehow involved basedin part on a phone call in 1978, six years before the allegedoffenses.   -- In their reply memo, Mr. Milken's lawyers accuseprosecutors of extraordinary overreaching. In addition to theabusive use of the anti-Mafia RICO law, they make the seriousaccusation that &quot;many of the allegations presented by thegovernment relate to incidents that we believe are not`crimes' under federal statutes.&quot;   Prosecutors seeking a sentence for crimes Mr. Milkenrefused to admit is par for the course in this prosecution.Rudolph Giuliani twisted RICO to coerce a plea from DrexelBurnham Lambert and testimony from others. Prosecutorsindicted Mr. Milken's brother Lowell as a hostage. They evensent an FBI agent to pressure Mr. Milken's 92-year-oldgrandfather. The battle over Mr. Milken's non-admissions isanother reason that after all the publicized investigationprosecutors should have taken this case to trial.   How much punishment does Mr. Milken deserve? Anything likethe maximum 28 years would be absurd. Unlike Ivan Boesky,Dennis Levine and Martin Siegel, Mr. Milken was not convictedof insider trading. Mr. Boesky made more than $80 million bytrading cash -- often literally in suitcases -- for theinside information bankers Levine and Siegel stole from theirclients. All three knew they were committing serious,entirely nontechnical crimes.   So Mr. Boesky's three-year sentence should establish ahigh ceiling for Mr. Milken's punishment. Indeed, Judge Woodmight note that despite prosecutors analyzing hundreds oftransactions where Mr. Milken had enormous inside informationon takeovers, they could not prove he traded on any of it.   Mr. Milken committed crimes, but these were chieflyaccommodations for more serious lawbreaking by others,including Mr. Boesky. Most of the crimes in years past wouldhave been dealt with by stern letters from the Securities andExchange Commission. There are few, if any, victims. Even theclearly illegal fudging on the commissions Drexel got fromthe Finsbury Fund (legal if disclosed) amounted to severalhundred thousand dollars.   Judge Wood has hundreds of letters on the sentence Mr.Milken deserves. These overwhelmingly urge a light sentence.There are few letters from clients claiming Mr. Milken didthem wrong. Letters from public-school teachers and hospitaladministrators cite Mr. Milken's volunteer work and oftenanonymous charitable donations, which predated his legaltroubles. Letters from former Drexel colleagues remind thejudge that Mr. Milken criticized recent overly leveragedtakeovers, which he called &quot;Xeroxes&quot; of earlier successfulfinancings that ignored changed circumstances.   The most provocative information may be what was redactedor censored from the sentencing memos. There is a singlereference to a probation report in Mr. Milken's memo. This isfollowed by blackouts wherever it seems there might be areference to favorable conclusions of a probation officer.These findings are confidential, but there are reports thatit concludes Mr. Milken's contributions outweigh his crimes.This first assessment by a neutral observer may help explainwhy prosecutors want more hearings.   Mr. Milken has already suffered from the years of legalbattles. Indeed, consider the $1.1 billion prosecutors saidhe earned from 1984 to 1987. Subtract from this the $600million fine Mr. Milken agreed to pay, the $500 million heprobably paid in state and federal taxes and the $300 millionhis aides say he gave to charities. Grand total: minus $300million, not counting his legal bills.   What would be an appropriate sentence? Mr. Milken'slawyers suggest taking up the invitation of Los AngelesPolice Chief Daryl Gates to sentence him to community serviceon an anti-drug program.   Whatever the punishment, Judge Wood's sentencing will atleast be the first legitimate legal action against Mr.Milken. The contribution to justice from prosecutors in thiscase includes RICO, unconstitutionally freezing Mr. Milken'ssalary, helping drive Drexel into liquidation and threateningMr. Milken with the smear of lawsuits blaming him for thesavings-and-loan crisis. It is time for a judge to try tocraft some justice after a prosecution that knew no bounds.   ---                  Where Does Milken Fit?
