Traditionally a loss leader, sold at or below cost to attract customers to the store, Thanksgiving turkeys can always be found for a song by smart shoppers. But this year, record production is inspiring some grocers to add new chords.    Cheap feed prices and healthy consumer demand prompted producers to raise an estimated 240 million turkeys this year. By Oct. 31, 675 million pounds of turkey should have been stockpiled in warehouses, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., an Arlington Heights, Ill.-based commodity research firm. &quot;That's about three pounds for every man, woman and child in this country,&quot; Mr. Morgan said.    With wholesale prices at an estimated 56 cents to 60 cents a pound, the glut has knocked 23% to 28% off last year's fourth-quarter prices. Overall, the Agriculture Department is forecasting an average fourth-quarter retail turkey price of about 90 cents a pound, or 16% less than a year ago.    Given that, grocers should be able to outdo last year's specials. The National Turkey Federation estimates that grocers will be offering special Thanksgiving prices ranging from 29 cents to 49 cents a pound.    Piggly Wiggly Carolina Co., which operates 110 supermarkets in South Carolina and Georgia, exhausted its Thanksgiving supply of 10-pound to 12-pound birds early this month by allowing shoppers to redeem three books of its trading stamps for a turkey. Customers gobbled up 25,000 of the turkeys in two weeks. Usually, the Charleston, S.C.-based grocer sells only 20,000 of that size during the whole Thanksgiving season.    ShopRite Inc., an Elizabeth, N.J.-based grocery chain with 180 stores in six Eastern states, is expecting to sell seven million to eight million pounds of its house-brand turkey this Thanksgiving, or nearly double the four million pounds sold last year. Shoppers buying at least $50 in groceries can bag a bird for 39 cents a pound -- 19 cents with a store coupon. Last year, the prices were 79 cents a pound and 39 cents a pound with a coupon.    The low prices may also help turkey best its traditional Christmas rival -- ham. Sterling's Mr. Morgan credits the turkey bargains with thwarting an annual rise in ham prices. Before last Thanksgiving, ham wholesale prices rose 2% to 7%. Despite smaller stocks this year, prices have fallen 10 cents from August's peak to 84 cents a pound.    What's more, turkey hams -- turkey meat processed to look and taste like pork ham -- are vying for some of pork's market. One Chicago-area grocer was selling turkey hams for as much as $2.20 a pound less than the pork version. &quot;From a consumer standpoint, if it looks like it, tastes like it and costs a little less, go for it,&quot; said Kenneth Rutledge, an executive vice president for Norbest Inc., a Salt Lake City-based turkey marketer.    As might be expected, the low turkey prices for consumers are bad news for producers. Most will be doing all they can just to break even this year, said Mr. Rutledge. Despite the glut, first-quarter and second-quarter production plans call for a continuation of this year's expansion. Many of those turkeys have already been hatched. But officials at the turkey federation expect sagging profits to force producers to scale back by the third quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
