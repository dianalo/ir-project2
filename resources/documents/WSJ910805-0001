Givens is well on his way tobecoming the best-selling financial self-help author of alltime.   His &quot;Wealth Without Risk,&quot; published in 1988, has been onthe New York Times best-seller list for 119 straight weeksand has sold 1.25 million hard-cover copies. His new book,&quot;Financial Self-Defense,&quot; has sold 600,000 copies.</LP><TEXT>   And then there's the rest of the empire: He operates anationwide educational organization that he says has 360,000members, and he has built a complex structure of affiliatedcompanies that sell investment products. Mustachioed anddapper, the 50-year-old Mr. Givens often can be seen onlate-night television in a paid &quot;infomercial&quot; that touts hisfree seminars and depicts him enjoying the good life: Helives with his second wife, who he says once won a Miss SexyOrlando contest, in a lakefront estate near Orlando, completewith pool, spas, and chef. The theme of his pitch is simple:Millionaire tells the average Joe how to make it big.   But is it so simple? Many investment and tax professionalsare roundly criticizing &quot;Wealth Without Risk&quot; as simplistic,exaggerated and downright inaccurate. What's more, theSecurities and Exchange Commission and state securitiesregulators in North Dakota are also raising questions. Theyare probing whether Mr. Givens has failed to disclosematerial information to investors about the risks involved inhis real estate partnerships, says a person familiar with theinvestigations. Insurance regulators in North Dakota shutdown his Life Insurance Clearinghouse, which they allege madeclaims that were &quot;untrue, deceptive or misleading.&quot; Andseparately, the Internal Revenue Service has disputed the wayMr. Givens did his taxes; he ended up paying a total of $3.1million in back taxes and interest in a settlement.   Still, the growing number of Americans who read Mr.Givens's books and join his groups don't seem to care.   Mr. Givens has tapped a huge audience of people who dreamof getting rich by pulling themselves up by their ownbootstraps, studying at night the secrets to wealth andsuccess. In earlier times, they made best sellers of bookslike Albert J. Lowry's &quot;How to Become Financially Independentby Investing in Real Estate&quot; and Robert Allen's &quot;NothingDown.&quot;   Today, their guru is Mr. Givens. Much of his success isdue to shrewd marketing and salesmanship. Aside from his TVcommercials, he recruits new members through free seminars,telemarketing and a &quot;Share the Wealth&quot; group whose membersget a commission for each person they sign up.   &quot;Wealth Without Risk&quot; offers 268 strategies to make moneyand save on taxes. People didn't seem to mind that many ofthe ideas are old (&quot;Don't buy bonds when interest rates arerising&quot;) or over-optimistic (&quot;Send your kids to college free&quot;by transforming a home near campus &quot;into a mini-studentdorm&quot;) or might raise flags at the IRS (&quot;When in doubt,deduct it&quot;).   Seeing the anybody-can-do-it optimism of the 1980s fade inthe recessionary 1990s, Mr. Givens takes a defensive posturein &quot;Financial Self-Defense,&quot; published last fall. He claimsthat Americans lose an &quot;automatic $10,000 to $20,000&quot; eachyear from &quot;perfectly legal schemes&quot; used by banks, brokers,the IRS, insurance companies and others.   So the book lists 186 ways to fight back. They range from&quot;Always buy the car you want but only after it is two yearsold&quot; to &quot;Cut the cost of your credit card accounts by 50%with no-fee and low-interest-rate cards.&quot;   Larry Jordan, 35, a drugstore manager in Walls, Miss.,says he feels he has gotten his money's worth by followingsuch Givens advice as increasing auto insurance deductiblesand moving to an interest-bearing money-market account forchecking. &quot;He has taught us how to close up the cracks in ourfinancial structure,&quot; adds his wife, Marilyn. She says sheand her husband don't have enough money to test Mr. Givens'sbigger investment strategies.   It's those grander tactics that tend to draw hoots frominvestment professionals. For example, Kurt Brouwer, partnerin Brouwer andamp; Janachowski, a San Francisco investmentmanagement firm, says it isn't true that small investors can&quot;time their investments in stocks, bonds and money marketinstruments to average 20% plus per year -- risk-free,&quot; asMr. Givens contends. In the past 20 years, Treasury billshave never returned over 20% in a single year, intermediatebonds have exceeded 20% only once and the Standard andamp; Poors'500 stocks have beat 20% only in seven years, he says. &quot;It'spossible to do 20% a year in stock mutual funds, but notwithout risk and the possibility of loss,&quot; Mr. Brouwer says.   As for accurately timing the investments, that is,switching between the various funds to maximize returns, hesays: &quot;You'd have to be dead-on perfect. It's almostinconceivable.&quot;   Jonathan Pond, an author and financial planner fromWatertown, Mass., takes issue with Mr. Givens's suggestionthat one can make an entire vacation deductible by schedulinga job interview at one's vacation spot and spending two hoursa day working on the deductible purpose. &quot;You can take aportion of your vacation, perhaps,&quot; but not the whole thing,he says.   Replying to his critics, Mr. Givens says, &quot;A financialplanner is just a fancy word for financial salesmen. Mostfinancial planners know less about finance than housewives.&quot;   Whether or not Mr. Givens has provided investors a way tobuild wealth without risk, he has found a way to do it forhimself through his privately owned Charles J. GivensOrganization. Mr. Givens says he made $12.5 million last yearin salary and royalties from reference materials sold by hisorganization, and paid $4.5 million in income taxes. He sayshis net worth is $110 million, including personal propertyand investments in radio stations, banks, real estate andother businesses.   His literature says that, for $399 and dues of $80 a year,a member of his educational organization gets a packet ofprinted materials, videotapes and audio tapes describingfinancial strategies, and a monthly newsletter and additionaltapes later. Members also get access to telephone advice on avariety of financial matters.   Mr. Givens and associates also have built a web ofaffiliated companies they say sell services and products tomembers. According to Givens literature, Delta FirstFinancial sells securities and limited partnerships and doesfinancial planning; Delta Capital Corp. is involved incommercial and residential real estate development; and&quot;clearinghouses&quot; sell health and life insurance policies.   The SEC's Miami office has been investigating Delta FirstFinancial, based here in Longwood, Fla., for about a year. Aperson familiar with the case says the SEC is focusing onwhether Givens investors received adequate disclosure ofrisks and possible conflicts of interest in investments inprivate limited real estate partnerships. The SEC declines tocomment.   Charles C. Smith, chief executive of Delta Capital, saysthe Delta First affiliate sold some 60 private limited realestate partnerships to members of the Givens organization.Mr. Givens says that about $35 million was raised. None ofthe partnerships were registered under federal securitieslaws, because they were offered under exemptions to smallgroups of supposedly sophisticated investors. North Dakotasecurities regulators are involved in a similar investigationof Delta First.   Mr. Givens doesn't appear very concerned about the SECinvestigation. &quot;What a nuisance,&quot; he says. &quot;All I'm doing ispaying lawyers to fight their lawyers. When they investigatesomeone, they always seem to pick on someone who is big. Wegot too big in private limited partnerships.&quot; So Delta Firstno longer sells its own partnerships, he says.   Glenn Pomeroy, North Dakota's Securities Commissioner,says the partnerships &quot;are about as unattractive from thebasis of disclosure of risk as any we have seen. They won'tpass muster in our state.&quot; He says other states areinvestigating the Givens operations, too.   Mr. Pomeroy cites Marketplace Income Fund Ltd., a 1989Florida limited partnership. According to Marketplace'sprivate placement memorandum, the partnership was formed tobuy 1.2 acres of land near Orlando for $772,000 and boughtthe land from a Givens affiliate, which also set the price.The affiliate's profit: $326,150. The partnership then leasedthe land back to the affiliate so it could build an officebuilding there. The partnership memo states that &quot;it mightnot be considered an arms-length transaction.&quot;   In this transaction, there is &quot;inadequate disclosure ofwho relates to whom and who gets what from whom,&quot; says Mr.Pomeroy. Moreover, the investors, who put up a minimum stakeof $22,000, get only unaudited financial statements, he says.   Mr. Smith, Delta Capital's chief executive, says&quot;potential conflicts of interest&quot; exist in the Marketplacetransaction, but he adds: &quot;We have substantial experience inCentral Florida. We will handle the investors' money withintegrity and tell them all the risks.&quot;   Particularly disturbing, Mr. Pomeroy says, are provisionsin some partnerships that permit one to lend money to anotherwithout consulting investors. Southampton Income Fund Ltd., a1989 Florida limited partnership, for example, was set up toraise $1.2 million from investors to make mortgage loans fordevelopment and construction of various Givens affiliates'real estate properties, according to a private placementmemorandum. The document notes that an affiliate &quot;may borrowequity out of the property and use the money for otherpurposes.&quot;   Mr. Givens says regulators should spend more timepreventing the bankruptcies of giant real estate partnershipsand less time hounding him. &quot;No investor has ever lost a dimein one of my partnerships,&quot; he says.   North Dakota had already pressured the Givens group onanother matter: It got the concern to refund membership feesto 281 people who joined last summer after attending aseminar. Some of them complained that materials in the $399packet they received didn't go beyond advice in Mr. Givens'sbook.   &quot;It was totally overpriced and we got taken in by thehype,&quot; says Ann Vander Maten, a Fargo, N.D., rancher. AmyKraalen, a Lambert, Mont., farmer who drove four hours tohear the seminar, says: &quot;What we got for our $400 wasn'tworth it. It was a three-ring notebook with real crappy audioand videotapes.&quot;   Mr. Givens has also run afoul of insurance regulators inNorth Dakota. Last year, Insurance Commissioner Earl Pomeroy,the securities commissioner's older brother, issued acease-and-desist order requiring Mr. Givens's Life InsuranceClearinghouse to stop operations in the state. The insurancedepartment said it acted because of &quot;illegalmisrepresentations&quot; about policies for sale and &quot;the use ofnonlicensed agents operating from a telephone bank inLeesburg, Fla.&quot;   According to the insurance department's order, the Givensorganization told members they can &quot;buy insurance directlyfrom the insurance company without paying sales commissions&quot;and that they &quot;can choose from over 1,000 insurancecompanies.&quot; Earl Pomeroy says his investigation concludedthat the two agents at the clearinghouse do in fact receivesales commissions and that the customer pays. He adds thatthe agents can write policies for only five life insurancecompanies nationwide.   Mr. Pomeroy says the clearinghouse claims that it hascompanies listed on a computer and that it has a data bankfor ongoing research to secure the lowest-cost, best policy.&quot;In fact, they do not have any type of computerized system&quot;for this, Mr. Pomeroy says.   Robert E. Hewell, director of the Life InsuranceClearinghouse, an affiliate of the Givens organization, saysthat any misleading information came from a North Dakotalecture by a Givens speaker, or from first editions of&quot;Wealth Without Risk.&quot; All lectures have been corrected, ashave later editions of Mr. Givens's book, he says. Mr. Hewelladds, however, that agents at the clearinghouse can writebusiness for 25 companies nationwide. He concedes that thecompany doesn't have a computerized data base.   Mr. Givens sees the insurance crackdown as a way forinsurance companies already in the state to prevent him fromcompeting. He says the state's order is no big deal, sincehis company sold only three policies in the state out of&quot;10,000 to 15,000&quot; sold nationally.   As for the tax case, it was settled out of court lastyear, Mr. Givens says. The IRS took issue with the taxreturns of Mr. Givens and his organization, which wastax-exempt until 1986, according to IRS documents on file atthe U.S. Tax Court in Washington. Until 1986, Mr. Givensconducted his operations under the nonprofit, educationalCharles J. Givens Foundation.   The IRS contended in a final determination letter sent toMr. Givens in 1988 that because the foundation made &quot;largeloans for non-exempt purposes, made excessive rental paymentsand paid the personal living expenses&quot; of Mr. Givens, itwasn't tax-exempt and owed taxes for 1983, 1984 and 1985. Mr.Givens denied those allegations but paid the taxes, plusinterest.   Mr. Givens says he doesn't allow these kinds of hassles toaffect his life style, which he says fits his &quot;millionaire&quot;image. He says he spends only half a day a week in theoffice, and spends two months of every year traveling aroundthe world with his wife Adena, 30. He says he communicateswith his hand-picked crew of executives by fax and telephone.   Mr. Givens is driven to appearances in Florida in his22-foot white limousine with gold hood ornaments and hubcaps.He also drives around town in his Rolls-Royce or Excaliber.&quot;Every day is a holiday for me,&quot; he says.   His upbringing certainly wasn't that of a millionaire, hesays. He was born in Decatur, Ill., of middle-class parentswho separated. As a high school student he readpositive-thinking books like &quot;Psycho-Cybernetics&quot; by MaxwellMaltz and &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; by Napoleon Hill until thebindings fell apart. He says he also studied successfulpeople and copied the way movie stars like Paul Newmantalked.   After dropping out of Millikin University in Decatur, hewrites in &quot;Wealth Without Risk,&quot; he went out to make hisfortune; he says he made and lost upwards of a milliondollars three times. He has claimed he made his money bycreating a &quot;Nashville music business conglomerate,&quot; byinvesting in stocks, and through the &quot;creation of a luxuriousyacht club&quot; in Florida. Several journalists who have tried tovalidate his claims have come up dry.   In &quot;Wealth Without Risk,&quot; he writes: &quot;I moved from thebottom to the executive suites of Genesco, a major apparelconglomerate, by designing management computer systems. . . .The job gave me the leverage to use borrowed money to financemy way into almost a million dollars of stock market wealth.&quot;   A spokeswoman at Genesco Inc. in Nashville, Tenn., saysMr. Givens worked in the company's computer division from1967 to 1971 as a systems analyst, but the highest title hehad was &quot;manager of methods and procedures.&quot; Mr. Givens wasnever a senior officer, she says.   Mr. Givens says there were 2,000 to 3,000 second-level &quot;E&quot;managers at Genesco when he worked there, and that he wasmade an &quot;E&quot; level manager two months before he left thecompany. &quot;I never said I was a senior officer,&quot; he says.   There were later stints as a real estate broker and as asalesman with Glenn Turner's &quot;Dare To Be Great&quot; motivationalcourse, Mr. Givens says. &quot;Dare To Be Great&quot; later collapsed,and prosecutors characterized it as a pyramid scheme.   In the early 1980s, Mr. Givens began selling tapes on howto invest. He says he got a big break when a reporter in amedium-sized town interviewed him and misconstrued hiswealth. The resulting story headlined &quot;Man With $10 MillionGives Secrets of Becoming Wealthy&quot; packed the lecture hall,Mr. Givens says.   The angle of the millionaire giving financial advice hasworked ever since. Though Mr. Givens no longer goes out onthe lecture circuit, five Givens lecturers travel the countrygiving free seminars encouraging people to join hisorganization.   Mr. Givens says he's planning an expansion into Canada inthe fall, and a shelf of new books, including: &quot;Super Self --How to Become Ten Feet Tall and Bullet Proof.&quot; His mission inlife, he says, is &quot;to share with as many people as possiblethe tools and strategies that have made me a successful andhappy person.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
