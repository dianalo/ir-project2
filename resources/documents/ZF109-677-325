Suite 550 Seattle, WA 98109(800) 477-0348andM;TEST CONFIGURATION: ScriptServer version 3.1, a Micro VAX 3100 running VMSversion 5.3 and a QMS-PS 800+ PostScript printer connected via a DECserverLocal Area Transport portandM;PRICE AS TESTED: $995andM;PROS: * Supports 60 printer-resident fonts  * Adobe printer fonts can bedownloaded to PostScript printersandM;CONS: * Font pop-up menu does not distinguish all available fonts  * Only onefont and size per ASCII document can be specifiedandM;READER SERVICE: Circle No.andP;  402 on Reader Service CardandM;Although PostScript printing is certainly not new to the VAX/VMS computingarena--DEC's  PrintServer and LN03R printer models both offer PostScriptsupport, and the DEClaser printer family should soon--the number of VMS-basedapplications that can take advantage of PostScript printing capabilities isstill painfully small.andP;  When the incompatibilities between VMS queues andthird-party PostScript printers are also taken into account, it is no mysterywhy the great majority of VMS users continue to rely on ANSI/sixel printers.andM;Now, thanks to a package from Gray Matter Software, VMS users can bring thesetwo disparate worlds together.andP;  The ScriptServer printing system bridges thegap between VMS and PostScript by allowing system managers to establish VMSqueues for PostScript printers and by providing an interface that allowsusers to print ASCII, Postscript and Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language(HP-GL) files to such print queues.andM;With ScriptServer, users can spice up their output by changing a wide varietyof output characteristics, among them fonts and font sizes.andP;  An ASCII filecan, however, be printed only with a single set of characteristics that mustapply to the entire file.andP;  ScriptServer supports 60 printer-resident fonts,and lets users download Adobe printer fonts on either job-by-job or permanentbases.andM;More flexibility comes in the form of job routing and settings libraries.andO;With the establishment of VMS queue characteristics to represent font namesand paper sizes, users can automatically route jobs to specific printerssimply by specifying the desired characteristics when submitting the printjob.andM;The settings library makes it easy to save frequently used parameters.andO;Settings can include margins, fonts, font sizes and character spacing.andP;  Userscan create, save and easily retrieve whole groups of settings.andP;  For example,users can save one group of settings for printing a newsletter, and saveanother group of settings for printing flyers or brochures.andM;The ScriptServer printing system consists of two principal components--theScriptServer print symbiont and the Script facility.andP;  The ScriptServer printsymbiont interacts with the PostScript printer and performs the conversionfrom ASCII (or HP-GL) to PostScript format.andM;The Script facility, which can be used in either command-line or menu mode,is a front-end interface to the print symbiont that allows users to controlmuch of the translation process.andP;  Through the Script facility, users canspecify output characteristics, such as page layout, font size, characterspacing and page numbering, as well as job-related settings such as job name,priority, form name and output queue.andM;The software was easily installed using the standard VMSINSTAL commandprocedure.andP;  As part of the installation procedure, ScriptServer automaticallycreated a queue and established queue characteristics for our PostScriptprinter.andM;Alternatively, we could just as easily have deferred the establishment of thequeue and its characteristics until after the installation was completed.andO;Two command files--CHAR_DEF.COM and Q_MGR.COM--can be used to perform thesefunctions, allowing users to customize queue characteristics and createqueues for as many PostScript printers as they require.andM;DOWNLOAD.COM, another command file, enables users to specify Adobe printfonts for permanent downloading to specific print queues.andP;  This file, whichis invoked by ScriptServerhs start-up procedure, must be customized by systemmanagers.andP;  By default, ScriptServer is set to search for the fonts in thedirectory in which it was installed.andP;  Fonts must be permanently downloaded orbe printer-resident before they can be used.andM;Unfortunately, Gray Matter Software does not supply any fonts.andP;  Adobe fontscan, however be uploaded directly from a DOS-based PC, and ScriptServer alsosupports the ASCII packed version of these font files.andP;  Adobe font files,however, cannot be uploaded and used from a Macintosh.andM;Once the software was installed and our VMS queue established, DR Labs putthe ScriptServer software to the test.andM;Print requests can be submitted with one of two commands--the usual VMS PRINTcommand or ScriptServer's SCRIPT.andP;  The PRINT command, which must be used whenputting PostScript files, can also be used for printing ASCII files.andM;However, the PRINT command offers much less direct control over theASCII-to-PostScript translation process than does the SCRIPT command.andM;When used with ScriptServer, the VMS PRINT command, for the most part,behaves just as it would if it were being used to print to a conventionalANSI/sixel printer.andP;  Although most qualifiers behave as expected, there aresome differences worth noting.andM;Normally, the /CHARACTERISTICS qualifier to the PRINT command is used toroute print jobs to specific printers.andP;  When used in the ScriptServercontext, this qualifier can be used to specify PostScript features.andP;  Forinstance, the command PRINT/CHARACTERISTICS=(HELVETICA, LETTER) would routethe print job to a PostScript printer with the Helvetica font andletter-sized paper.andM;Similarly, the /SETUP qualifier is used to call setup modules from the devicecontrol library.andP;  All setup modules used by ScriptServer must be written inPostScript because no translation is performed on them.andM;The PRINT command must also be used when downloading fonts for specific jobs.andO;In such cases, the command must be used with the /PARAMETER qualifier.andP;  Forinstance, to download a font called Utopia to our PostScript printer (whichis attached to the queue named QMS) before printing a file, we issued thefollowing command:andM;PRINT/PARAMETER=PRELOAD=UTOPIA/QUEUE=QMS FILE.TXTandM;The PRINT command is required when printing PostScript files.andP;  TheScriptServer print symbiont assumes that the file is in ASCII format unlessit fulfills one of three criteria the file name extension is PS forPostScript (or HP for HP-GL files); the first two characters in the file are%!; or the Data_Type parameter to the PRINT command is used to specifyPostScript.andP;  We used the PRINT command to print several test PostScript filesand found that the ScriptServer print symbiont was able to recognize andhandle these files without problems.andM;The SCRIPT command offers much more control over the translation process thandoes the PRINT command.andP;  The Script facility can be used in either a menu orcommand-line mode.andP;  The menu allows users to set and change a variety ofparameters (Fig.andP;  1).andM;Through the menu, users can specify file names and output queues.andP;  Users canalso specify fonts, paper sizes, margin settings and page numbering.andP;  Toestablish or modify settings, users must enter a two-letter command(indicated by the highlighted text in the menu) followed by the parameter.andO;For menu items that have Yes/No values, only a two-letter command is requiredto switch the value of the selected item.andM;For some items, such as the font setting, users can make selections frompop-up menus.andP;  We used the pop-up menu to select fonts for our print jobs.andO;Although the font pop-up menu displayed a rather generous listing of fonts tochoose from, we were only able to use fonts that were either printer-residentor permanently downloaded.andM;Permanently downloaded fonts are marked with an asterisk, but there is nodenotation for printer-resident fonts (Fig.andP;  2).andP;  Without knowing which fontsare resident on their printers, users can easily stumble during thefont-selection procedure.andP;  In fact, during our testing, we were forced tokeep the printer's status page nearby to remind us which fonts were usable.andM;Although ScriptServer will initially accept any font selection from the menu,whether available or unavailable, and attempt to download a font, the errormessage &quot;font not available&quot; is displayed if a font cannot be accessed; theuser is then cued to proceed, or not to proceed, with submitting the job tothe printer.andP;  If he or she chooses to submit the job anyway, most printerswill substitute Courier for the absent font.andM;SMMOTHING THE FONT PATHandM;In a ScriptServer environment that supports several different PostScriptprinters--each with a different set of resident fonts--this confusion caneasily be compounded.andP;  One way around this problem is to set up queuecharacteristics so that print jobs with certain selected fonts are routed tothe appropriate PostScript printer.andM;Pop-up menus can be used for other settings, such as heading and numberinglocations, library settings, queue names, paper sizes and types, and formnames.andM;By pressing the Next Screen key on our VT330 keyboard, we were able to accessa second-tier menu that allowed us to modify several other settings.andM;Through this second menu, we specified the number of copies to be printed andindicated whether we wanted our output to be collated.andP;  The Collate featureis particularly attractive, because it allows users to print and organizemultiple-copy print jobs in much the same way that a photocopy machine does.andM;When using the Collate feature to print five copies of a 10-page document,ScriptServer will first print five copies of page one, then five copies ofpage two, and continue until the print job is completed.andP;  Once we chose oursettings, we were able to print by pressing the Do key on our keyboard.andM;Customized groups of settings can be saved for future use by typing the SScommand at the Script prompt at the menu.andP;  For example, we saved a group ofsettings and associated the name BEST with them by typing SS BEST andpressing the Return key at the Script prompt.andP;  Similarly, we recalled thesesettings by typing RS BEST followed by the Return key.andM;Although the menu interface provides an easy-to-follow method for specifyingsettings, users can perform all the same functions via a command lineinterface.andP;  Each menu item has an associated qualifier that can be invoked atthe VMS level.andP;  For instance, to print a file called TEST.TXT, using theHelvetica font with a point size of 20, a user would type the following:andM;SCRIPT/QUEUE=QMS/FONT=HELVETICA/SCALE=20 TEST.TXTandM;We put the ScriptServer software through its paces, testing it with a varietyof ASCII files.andP;  In addition, we tested its ability to recognize and printPostScript files.andP;  We printed our ASCII test files, which ranged in size fromfive to 100 blocks, with a variety of settings.andM;We then tested both printer-resident fonts and downloaded fonts, using avariety of page layouts and point sizes.andP;  We encountered no difficulties inprinting ASCII files with either printer-resident or downloaded fonts.andM;Throughout the testing, ScriptServer performed exceptionally well.andP;  However,because it is a software-based solution to the ASCII/PostScriptincompatibility issue, it imposes additional CPU overhead.andM;To assess the CPU overhead imposed by ScriptServer during the translation andprinting process, we printed three ASCII files--a five-block file, 50-blockfile and 100-block file--to our QMS-PS 800+ PostScript printer.andP;  For ourtesting, we specified the Palatino-Roman font (printer-resident) with a fontsize of 12.andP;  We used the default ScriptServer values for the remainder of thesettings.andM;The printer symbiont required only 0.7 CPU seconds to translate and print thefive-block file and 3.2 BPU seconds to translate and print the 50-block file.andO;The 100-block ASCII file required 6.0 CPU seconds.andM;In contrast, the VMS print symbiont required only about 0.4 CPU seconds toprint each file as an ASCII file on an LN03 printer.andP;  The overhead imposed bythe software is not particularly great and, in most instances, will notsubstantially increase system loads.andM;ScriptServer ranges in price from $495 for VAXstations to $3,895 for aVAXcluster.andP;  For a MicroVAX 3100, the software is priced at $995.andM;With an interface that is easy to understand and use, ScriptServer is alsoflexible enough to meet users' varied PostScript needs.andP;  And, unlike ahardware-based emulation product, ScriptServer can be used to set up multipleprint queues to accommodate several PostScript printers.andM;The ScriptServer printer system is a solid performer that is sure to attractmany VMS users to the world of PostScript.andM;TEST MODELandM;ScriptServer software is intended to bridge the gap between the VMS operatingsystem and the PostScript page description language, providing an environmentin which VMS users can take advantage of the printing flexibility afforded byPostScript output devices.andM;The ScriptServer print symbiont performs an ASCII-to-PostScript translationthat allows users to print VMS text files to their PostScript printers.andP;  Atthe same time, the Script facility--the front end to the printsymbiont--enables users to control the translation process by choosing a widevariety of output characteristics, including font, point size and pagelayout.andM;DR Labs evaluated ScriptServer on a MicrovAX 3100 running VMS version 5.3.andP;  AQMS-PS 800+ PostScript printer was connected through its serial port to aDECserver, which in turn communicated with the MicroVAX using the Local AreaTransport protocol.andM;We then tested ScriptServer's ability to recognize and handle PostScriptfiles.andP;  Because no translation is required for PostScript files that aresubmitted as PostScript jobs, it is, obviously, important that ScriptServercan differentiate between ASCII and PostScript files.andP;  We printed severalPostScript test files (five, 50 and 100 blocks long) by submitting them asprint jobs to our QMS printer via the ScriptServer software.andM;We also evaluated ScriptServer's flexibility by using the Script facility tospecify different output settings, such as fonts, point sizes and page layoutsettings.andM;Finally, to assess the efficiency of ScriptServer's ANSI/sixel-to-PostScripttranslation process, we measured the CPU overhead associated with individualfile translations.andP;  We printed ASCII test files five, 50 and 100 blocks inlength to our QMS-PS 800+ PostScript printer and compared the results withthose obtained using the VMS print symbiont.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
