Thefollowing summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissedby the Office of Hearings and Appeals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Petition for Special Redress</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Oklahoma, </T3>5/13/88, <T3>KEG-0032</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning a Petition for Special Redressfiled by the State of Oklahoma. The State sought approval to use StripperWell funds for a project previously found by the DOE's Assistant Secretaryfor Conservation and Renewable Energy to be inconsistent with the termsof the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement. After reviewing Oklahoma's proposalto grant $100,000 to Waynoka Manufacturing, the DOE decided to disapprovethe Oklahoma Petition. The DOE found that the project, which would useStripper Well funds for the design and production of fiberglass vaults,was an economic development program and did not provide energy-relatedbenefits to injured consumers of petroleum products. Accordingly, Oklahoma'sPetition for Special Redress was denied.<ITAG tagnum="84">Refund Applications</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>APCO Oil Corp./B.J. Brooks Oil Co., </T3>5/10/88, <T3>RF83-136</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by B.J. Brooks Oil Company. Brooks, a motor gasoline and distillatefuel oil reseller, sought a portion of the settlement fund obtained bythe DOE through a consent order entered into with its supplier, Apco OilCorporation. The DOE determined that Brooks met the criteria for a refund,but had not made an adequate showing of injury to merit a refund in excessof the $5,000 small claims threshold. Specifically, the DOE found thatthe approximated cost bank data submitted by Brooks in support of its injuryclaim was not acceptable because it included cost and revenue componentsfor refined products other than motor gasoline. Accordingly, Brooks wasawarded a small claims refund of $5,000 plus $3,168 in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Modification and/or Rescission</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>New York, </T3>5/13/88, <T3>KER-0040</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order regarding a Motion for Reconsiderationfiled by the State of New York. The State's Motion sought reconsiderationof a DOE denial of a Petition for Special Redress that the State had filedpreviously. <T3>New York</T3>, 17 DOE andpara; 82,503 (1988). In <T3>New York</T3>, the DOE concluded that the State's proposal to use $5,000,000of its Stripper Well funds to start a Not-for-Profit Energy ConservationFinancing Fund was not consistent with the terms of the Stripper Well SettlementAgreement. In denying the State's Motion for Reconsideration of <T3>New York</T3>, the DOE found that the project would not be completedfor 12 years and that this period exceeds the Stripper Well requirementof timely restitution. Specifically, the DOE found that ten years is areasonable sunset period for Stripper Well programs. Therefore, the Motionfor Reconsideration was denied.<ITAG tagnum="84">Supplemental Order</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Apex Oil Company, </T3>5/10/88, <T3>KRX-0053</T3>The DOE considered a request for review of a Special Report Order issuedto Apex Oil Company, requiring the firm to provide the DOE with informationconcerning its crude oil transactions during the period January 1, 1978through March 31, 1978 and from February 1, 1979 through January 27, 1981.The SRO directed the firm to provide that information in 60 days. In itsrequest for review, Apex stated that the SRO was burdensome and that inany event, it would need additional time to provide the specified information.After fully reviewing the type of information that Apex was directed toprovide, the DOE found that the SRO was not unduly burdensome, and thatmost of the documents involved should already be in existence. Accordingly,the request to withdraw the SRO was denied. However, the DOE found thatin view of the considerable amount of material that the firm was directedto provide and the fact that Apex was involved in a bankruptcy proceeding,it should be granted additional time to comply with the SRO. The firm wastherefore granted an additional 60 days in which to provide the materialrelated to the earlier period and 120 additional days to provide responsespertaining to the latter period.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Bernard G. Gordon, et al., </T3>5/13/88, <T3>RF272-5045 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds to 49 applicants based on their respective purchases of refined petroleumproducts during the period August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981. Eachapplicant used the products for various agricultural activities, and eachdetermined its claim either by consulting actual purchase records or byestimating its consumption based on the acres it farmed. Each applicantwas an end-user of the petroleum products it claimed and was thereforepresumed injured. The sum of the refunds granted in this Decision is $938.All of the claimants will be eligible for additional refunds as additionalcrude oil overcharge funds become available.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Charles A. Johns, et al., </T3>5/9/88, <T3>RF272-9650 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds to 50 applicants based on their respective purchases of refined petroleumproducts during the period August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981. Eachapplicant used the products for various agricultural activities, and eachdetermined its claim either by consulting actual purchase records or byestimating its consumption based on the acres it farmed. Each applicantwas an end-user of the products it claimed and was therefore presumed injuredby the DOE. The sum of the refunds granted in this Decision was $2,626.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Christian Haaland A/S, et al., </T3>5/13/88, <T3>RD272-0244 et al.</T3>A group of thirty States and two Territories of the United States (collectively``the States'') filed Motions for Discovery relating to Applications forRefund filed by 58 foreign flagship carriers. In their refund applications,the foreign flagship carriers request refunds from the crude oil moniescurrently available for disbursement by the Office of Hearings and Appealsunder 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V, for injury incurred in purchases of domesticallyrefined petroleum products during the period August 19, 1973 through January27, 1981. In the motions for Discovery, the States sought information insupport of their position that foreign flagship carriers are not entitledto a refund. Since the issues raised by the States in these refund proceedingsare identical, OHA consolidated its consideration of the States' Motionsfor Discovery. In considering the States' discovery requests, OHA determinedthat conventional discovery is not appropriate in the context of a refundproceeding under Subpart V but that the States had raised certain matterscritical to OHA's evaluation of the underlying Applications for Refund.Accordingly, the States' Motions for Discovery were dismissed. However,OHA ordered additional pleadings by the foreign flagship carriers and theStates concerning: (1) Whether ``export sales'' are eligible for refundsas a matter of law; and (2) whether the carriers were able to pass throughcrude oil overcharges under the regulatory regime of the Federal MaritimeCommission.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Crystal Oil Company/Crystal-U.S.A., INC., </T3>5/11/88, <T3>RF136-1</T3>Crystal-USA, Inc., filed a request for a refund from a consent order fundmade available by Crystal Oil Company. Crystal-USA filed that request onbehalf of Crystal Petroleum Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of CrystalOil Company until February 1977, when it was purchased by Crystal-USA.The basis of the refund request was Crystal Petroleum Company's purchaseof motor gasoline from Crystal Oil Company. The DOE found that no refundwas warranted from the Crystal Oil Company consent order fund, since therelevant consent order settled only alleged crude oil violations and CrystalPetroleum Company did not purchase any crude oil from Crystal Oil Company.The DOE further found that Crystal Petroleum Company was not eligible fora Subpart V crude oil refund based on its gasoline purchases because itdid not show that it incurred any injury as a result of those purchases.Accordingly, the refund application was denied.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>George Brown et al., </T3>5/12/88, <T3>RF272-7005 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds to 50 applicants based on their respective purchases of refined petroleumproducts during the period August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981. Eachapplicant used the products for various agricultural activities, and eachcalculated its claim either by consulting actual purchase records or byestimating its consumption based on the acres it farmed. Each applicantwas an end-user of the products it claimed and was therefore found injuredbased upon the end-user presumption of injury. The sum of the refunds grantedin this Decision is $2,539.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Gilpatrick Ranch, et al., </T3>5/13/88, <T3>RF272-7111 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds to 50 applicants based on their respective purchases of refined petroleumproducts during the period August 19, 1973, through January 27, 1981. Eachapplicant used the products for various activities. With the exceptionof some agricultural applicants who used estimates to determine their volumeclaims, all of the applicants relied on actual purchase records from thecrude oil price control period. Each applicant was an end-user of the productsit claimed and was therefore found injured based upon the end-user presumptionof injury. The sum of the refunds granted in this Decision is $1,797. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>La Gloria Oil andamp; Gas Company/Racetrac Petroleum, Inc., </T3>5/13/88,<T3>RF263-29</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a refund from the La GloriaOil andamp; Gas Company Consent Order Fund to Racetrac Petroleum, Inc. TheDOE determined that the firm's approximated cost banks were sufficientto support most of the refund claimed, and, based upon the competitivedisadvantage methodology, determined that the firm was eligible for a refundof $21,112 ($11,483 principal plus $9,674 interest). <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>M.C. Barnes, et al., </T3>5/13/88, <T3>RF272-7180 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds to 26 applicants based on their respective purchases of refined petroleumproducts during the period August 19, 1973, through January 27, 1981. Eachapplicant used the products for various agricultural activities. Each applicantcalculated its volume claim either by consulting actual purchase recordsor by estimating its consumption based on the acres it farmed. Each applicantwas an end-user of the products it claimed and was therefore found injuredbased upon the end-user presumption of injury. The sum of the refunds grantedin this Decision is $671. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Marathon Petroleum Company/East Side Oil Company, </T3>5/12/88, <T3>RF250-2712, RF250-2713</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning two Applications for Refundfiled by East Side Oil Company, a retailer of motor gasoline and middledistillates covered by a consent order that the agency entered into withMarathon Petroleum Company. The Applicant limited its claim to 35 percentof its allocable share and therefore was not required to demonstrate injury.The refund approved in this Decision is $13,940 in principal and $2,257in interest. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Marathon Petroleum Company/Plymouth Oil, Inc., </T3>5/11/88, <T3>RF250-2745</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying Plymouth Oil's Applicationfor Refund filed in the Marathon Petroleum Company special refund proceeding.Plymouth was denied a refund because its entire claim was based on middledistillate purchases made after the July 1, 1976 decontrol date for middledistillates.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Girling andamp; Coutts, </T3>5/13/88, <T3>RF225-11024</T3>The DOE issued a Supplemental Order concerning a refund granted to Girlingandamp; Coutts in <T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Girling andamp; Coutts,</T3> 17 DOE andpara; 85,388 (1988).The DOE determined that the refund granted to the applicant had been basedon an understatement of the firm's purchases from Mobil. Therefore, anadditional refund of $34, representing $27 of principal and $7 of interest,was granted to the firm on the basis of the additional gallons purchased.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Meenan Oil Co., Inc., </T3>5/10/88, <T3>RF225-9205</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning the Application for Refundfiled by Meenan Oil Co., Inc., seeking a portion of the funds remittedby Mobil Oil Corp. pursuant to a consent order entered into by Mobil withthe DOE. Meenan purchased 79,074,284 gallons of middle distillates fromMobil during the consent order period. After applying a competitive disadvantageanalysis to the information submitted by Meenan, the DOE found that thefirm had purchased a portion of the Mobil middle distillates at below marketprices. Consequently, the refund amount for middle distillates was limitedto an amount equal to the gallons of product purchased at above marketprices multiplied by the per gallon refund rate. The refund granted totals$15,930, representing $12,808 in principal and $3,122 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corporation/R.L. Vallee, Inc., et al., </T3>5/10/88, <T3>FR225-6672 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision granting three Applications for Refund from theMobil Oil Corporation escrow account filed by retailers and resellers ofMobil refined petroleum products. Each applicant elected to apply for arefund based upon the presumptions set forth in the <T3>Mobil</T3> decision.<T3> Mobil Oil Corp.,</T3> 13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985). The DOE grantedrefunds totalling $9,934 ($7,987 principal plus $1,947 interest).<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Simonson Oil Co., Inc., </T3>5/9/88, <T3>RF225-10039, RF225-10040, RF225-10041</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfrom the Mobil Oil Corporation escrow account filed by Simonson Oil Co.,Inc., a reseller of Mobil refined petroleum products. In its refund application,Simonson elected to submit documentation that it was injured by Mobil'spricing practices. The DOE found that the firm's negative cost banks throughSeptember 1, 1974 indicated that the firm had passed through any motorgasoline overcharges incurred prior to that date. The DOE concluded thatSimonson was therefore eligible to receive the full volumetric refund amountonly for its purchases of Mobil motor gasoline made after September 1,1974. The refund amount was $4,180. Because this amount is less than the$5,000 small claims level and because the firm had not attempted to demonstrateinjury concerning its Mobil middle distillates and motor oil purchases,the DOE also granted Simonson a refund based on its purchases of thoseproducts in the amount of $625. The DOE further granted the firm interestof $1,171.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Northwest Pipeline Corp./Home Petroleum Corp., </T3>5/11/88,<T3> RF116-9</T3>In this Decision, OHA approved a refund application filed by Home PetroleumCorporation in the Northwest Pipeline Corporation refund proceeding. Homepurchased 5,622,300 gallons of natural gasoline from Northwest during theconsent order period. OHA found that Home paid above market prices for89 percent of the gallons that it purchased from Northwest, and incurredsubstantial amounts of gross and net excess costs. OHA therefore grantedHome a refund of $10,913 which equals the numbers of gallons that Homepurchased times the per gallon refund rate of $0.001941. Home also receivesaccrued interest of $3,961.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Osceola County Secondary Road Department, 5/9/88, RF272-6672</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a refund from crude oil overchargefunds to Osceola County Secondary Road Department (Osceola) based on itsdocumented purchases of refined petroleum products during the period August19, 1973, through January 27, 1981. Osceola used petroleum products inthe maintenance of county roads. The firm was an end-user of the productsit claimed and was therefore found injured based upon the end-user presumptionof injury. The sum of Osceola's refund granted in this Decision is $130.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>St. Joseph Public Schools, et al., 5/12/88, RF272-88 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds to seven public schooldistricts that filed Applications for Refund under OHA's Subpart V crudeoil overcharge refund proceedings. The DOE fund that the applicants hadprovided sufficient evidence of the volume of refined petroleum productsthat they purchased during the period August 19, 1973 through January 27,1981. As end-user of petroleum products, the applicants were presumed tohave been injured as a result of the crude oil overcharges. The total ofthe refunds granted was $697.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Standard Oil Co. (Indiana)/Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa andamp; ChippewaIndians Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan, Inc., 5/12/88, RQ251-448, RQ251-443</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting the refund applications filedby the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa andamp; Chippewa Indians (the GrandTraverse Band) and the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan, Inc. (Inter-TribalCouncil) in the Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) second-stage refund proceeding.Each of the six federally recognized tribal organizations in Michigan requestedpermission to use its portion of its Amoco monies to found programs suitedto the unique needs of its community. The DOE fund that the programs providedrestitution to injured consumers of petroleum products. Accordingly, thesubmissions were granted and the Grand Traverse Band and the Inter-TribalCouncil were given refunds totalling $17,305 (representing $15,314 in principaland $1,991 in interest).<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Standard Oil Co. (Indiana)/Indiana, 5/13/88, RM21-106</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order regarding a Motion for Modificationfiled by the State of Indiana in the Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) (AmocoII) second-stage refund proceeding. In its application, Indiana proposedto modify its use of $67,296.73 in Amoco II funds. The State proposed thatthe funds be used to supplement funds previously granted by the DOE fora Fuel Saver Van program and for an Energy Conservation Financial Assistanceprogram. The DOE approved Indiana's Motion for Modification, finding thatthe two programs for which the State proposed to spend additional fundswould make restitution to injured consumers of petroleum products in theState.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Steven W. Landers, et al., 5/9/88, RF272-933 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds to 150 applicants based on their respective purchases of refinedpetroleum products during the period August 19, 1973 through January 27,1981. Each applicant was an end-user of the products it claimed and wastherefore presumed injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges. The sumof the refunds granted in this Decision is $4,211.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>UPG, Inc./Mobil Oil Corporation, 5/12/88, RF288-2</T3>Mobil Oil Corporation filed a refund application in the UPG, Inc. refundproceeding. Mobil purchased 8,612,562 gallons of gasoline from UPG in June1979. Because of their isolated nature, these purchases appear to havebeen made on the spot market and would not ordinarily be eligible for arefund. Nevertheless, Mobil successfully demonstrated that the purchaseswere necessary for maintaining supplies to its base-period customers. Mobilalso submitted documents to prove that it sustained a loss in selling theUPG products. The DOE therefore granted Mobil a refund of $23,254, whichequals the number of gallons that Mobil purchased times the volumetricrate of $0.0027 per gallon. Mobil also receives accrued interest of $2,170.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Vickers Energy Corporation/Iowa, 5/12/88, RQ1-449</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order regarding an Application for Refundfiled by the State of Iowa in the Vickers Energy Corporation second-stagerefund proceeding. In the Decision, the DOE approved the disbursement of$131,472 ($72,984 in principal plus $58,488 in interest) from the VickersEnergy Corp. escrow account for use for five distinct energy conservationprograms that were approved in <T3>Standard Oil Co.
