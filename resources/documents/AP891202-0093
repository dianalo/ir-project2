Desert drummers and torch bearers marched through streets alongwith sword-wielding nationals in Bedouin robes and headgear as eachof the emirates also held separate celebrations.   U.A.E. President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan attended thedisplay of ground, sea and air weapons at a seafront boulevard inAbu Dhabi. About 5,000 spectators packed a grandstand.   Flanked by his top aides and rulers of the various emirates, theleader clapped as the Mirages swooped low overhead. One Mirage drewan ovation with aerobatics before formations of transport planes,armed helicopters and interceptors paraded.   The Mirage 2000s, six in all, were delivered a few days ago, thefirst batch of a $2.2 billion deal signed with France in 1985 andinvolving a total of 36 Mirages and various types of militaryhardware.   The arrival of the Mirages was seen as a sign of improvedrelations with France after a disagreement over a demand that theaircraft be equipped with U.S.-built Sidewinder air-to-surfacemissiles.   The parade was attended by French Defense Minister Jean-PierreChevenement along with a number of Arab Cabinet ministers andmilitary commanders.   Units of the various arms of the 43,000-strong armed forces tookpart in the parade, which also featured French-made Gazelle andAlouette III helicopters, Crotale, Exocet and Rapier missiles,Ferret scout cars, Saladin and Saracen armored personnel carriers.   U.S.-made Hercules and Buffalo transport planes andBritish-built Hawk jet fighters also were displayed.   It was the first military parade since 1977. Armed Forces Chiefof Staff Gen. Mohammed Saeed al-Badi said the parades had beeninterrupted largely on account of ``sadness caused by the MiddleEast wars'' and the recent eight-year conflict between Iran andIraq.   A leading oil-exporting nation, the U.A.E. like its neighboringcountries of the Persian Gulf has diverted sizable funds from theoil bonanza years of the 1970s to build a strong military.   Traditionally armed by Britain, which controlled the formerTrucial Coast sheikdoms from which the U.A.E. was formed in 1971,the federation has spread out its military shopping.   Aside from France, it has concluded new arms deals with Britain,Italy and Egypt offering unspecified types of weapons.   Al-Badi said the U.A.E. was in the process of strengthening thearmed forces and will shortly introduce conscription.   The federation comprises Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Rasal-Khaimah, Umm al-Quwain, Fujairah and Ajman, under the leadershipof the bigger and richer Abu Dhabi.   The vast revenues from oil sales have helped turn large tractsinto farmland, build light industries and give its estimated 1.8million people one of the world's highest per capita incomes _$15,000.   Mainly due to oil and gas sales, the country's gross nationalproduct increased from $1.81 billion in 1972 to $24.52 billion in1989, according to Central Bank statements.   The federation, mainly Abu Dhabi and Dubai, produces a total of2.6 million barrels of crude oil a day, according to a recentstatement by Oil Minister Mana Saeed Otaiba. It earned some $3.5billion this year from oil exports, but suffers a budget deficit of$500 million. The deficits have been chronic since the world oilmarket weakened in the early 1980s.   Sheik Zayed in a speech appealed to Iran and Iraq to hasten thepace toward a peace treaty ``so that the gulf may reap the fruit ofstability and security.''   He also declared his ``undivided support'' for the Palestinianuprising against Israel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, askingleaders of the world to help the Palestinians regain their ``rightsand stop the barbaric perpetrations of Israel against the Arabs inoccupied territory.''   He urged the people and leaders of Lebanon to patch up theirdifferences and push their country toward national reconciliation.</TEXT></DOC>
