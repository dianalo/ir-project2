Conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis said Thursday thatParliament will be dissolved a week from today so elections cantake place on Nov. 5.   Papandreou was indicted Thursday on charges involving an alleged$210 million bank embezzlement scandal, and last week on charges heinstigated a widespread illegal wiretapping network.   The 70-year-old leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement hasdenied involvement in both scandals, saying he is the victim of aconspiracy aimed at his ``political annihilation.''   Also Thursday, tens of thousands of people gathered at an Athenscathedral for the funeral liturgy of prominent deputy PavlosBakoyannis, a conservative lawmaker gunned down by the leftistNovember 17 guerrilla group.   The conservative New Democracy party and the Communist-dominatedCoalition of the Left and Progress took power after June electionsleft a splintered Parliament. They joined exclusively to prosecutepoliticians involved in scandals, before new elections for the300-member one-chamber Parliament.   Judicial and parliamentary inquiries have implicated Papandreou,four of his former senior ministers, and about 200 other people.   All five will stand trial before a special 13-member high courtthat will convene by late November, raising the possibilityPapandreou will campaign for office in the coming elections whileunder indictment.</TEXT></DOC>
