If the proposed reduction sticks, it would be the first cut in SDI spending since the &quot;Star Wars&quot; anti-missile project got under way five years ago. National Security Adviser Colin Powell said at a White House briefing that President Reagan might veto the whole defense authorization bill, which covers a wide range of weapons programs, if he thinks it sets too low a level of spending for SDI.    The national security adviser didn't specify how deep a cut would prompt a veto, but he said a separate proposal for a $3.2 billion budget would be &quot;crippling to the program.&quot; The administration is seeking $4.6 billion for the program in fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.    The 223-195 vote to cut SDI came as the House considered the $299.5 billion defense budget planned for fiscal 1989. Although Congress and the Reagan administration agreed in last year's budget summit to provide that overall level of military spending, both the House and the Senate are switching funds among the Pentagon's major arms programs.    The administration is fighting to shore up support for the SDI program, which is considered one of the principal legacies of the Reagan presidency. &quot;Senior administration officials have been making calls all day to House members,&quot; said Army Lt. Gen. Powell.    He disputed widespread reports that Vice President George Bush, who is assured of the Republican presidential nomination, isn't as enthusiastic as President Reagan about lofting anti-missile systems into space. &quot;The vice president is as committed to this program as the president is,&quot; he insisted.    The Senate will soon take up a proposed defense budget that would provide $4.3 billion for SDI. Although there will be attempts to cut that spending level, the Senate is likely to approve a higher level than the House.    The House also voted 244-174 to limit how much of the SDI budget could be spent on weapons that would use existing technologies. The amendment would cap spending on less exotic weapons systems to 40% of the overall Star Wars budget. That is about the current level of such spending, but Pentagon planners hope to increase the share dedicated to these technologies in order to move some Star Wars weapons closer to deployment.    Rep. John Spratt (D., S.C.) sponsor of the amendment, argued that more futuristic SDI technologies, such as laser weapons, show more promise of ultimately defending the U.S. against missile attacks.    Separately, the House adopted an amendment that helps U.S. coal producers. This provision, adopted Tuesday without debate, would block the Pentagon from signing new contracts to convert heating systems at U.S. bases in West Germany from coal to natural gas or other fuels. The provision, offered by Rep. Paul Kanjorski (D., Pa.), frustrates the Pentagon's plan to junk old furnaces in Germany and rely on municipally provided heat to save money and meet local environmental concerns. </TEXT></DOC>
