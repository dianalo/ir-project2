Anderson, the hostage heldlongest in Lebanon, and told her they had no indication any captiveswould be freed soon.   Peggy Say and three other American women arrived Tuesday nightfor what she called a one-week personal visit not linked to anycurrent effort to free Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondentof The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985 in Beirut.   Speculation has arisen again in Beirut that some of the 15foreigners held hostage, nine of whom are Americans, soon would befreed. Most are believed held by fundamentalist Shiite Moslems loyalto Iran.   On Wednesday, Mrs. Say met with Zouheir Jannan, director of theInformation Ministry, who told her President Hafez Assad'sgovernment considers the hostage issue ``a cause for Syria.''   He also informed her the situation was sensitive, ``and we havenothing to tell you,'' according to officials who spoke on conditionof anonymity.   Meetings with other senior officials, including InformationMinister Mohammed Salman, are expected before Mrs. Say's scheduleddeparture departure Feb. 16.   ``My visit coincides with my birthday Feb.15 and also with thethird anniversary of my father's death,'' said Mrs. Say, who lastvisited Syria in 1986.   Glenn Anderson died of cancer Feb. 15, 1986. Anderson's brotherGlenn also died of cancer on June 7 that year. As far as is known,Anderson is not aware of the deaths.   Mrs. Say said she recently received a ``very nice, comfortingmessage'' from Sheik Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader ofHezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to be an umbrellagroup for Shiites holding hostages.   ``I'd like to thank him personally if I could,'' she said, butdid not reveal the message.   Fadlallah now is in Tehran. Syrian officials said they wouldarrange a meeting if Fadlallah came to Damascus on his way back toLebanon.   Without elaborating, Mrs. Say said she received a similar messagefrom Assad and ``I wish to thank President Assad for all hisefforts.''   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, has been instrumental infreeing several Western hostages and has promised to help secure therelease of the others.   ``I'm not here to meet anybody in particular, but I'm open to seethose who want to talk to me,'' said Mrs. Say.
