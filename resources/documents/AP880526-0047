Under a proposal that won tentative approval of the House Waysand Means oversight subcommittee Wednesday, college bookstoresmight have to pay tax on some of their computer sales, and a museummight be taxed on food sales if an eating facilities catersprimarily to the general public.   Although aides said the package of proposals was given apreliminary endorsement by most subcommittee members, it is a longway from becoming law in this election year. No similar legislationis pending in the Senate.   Neither Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of the subcommittee,nor Don Chapoton, assistant secretary of the treasury for taxpolicy, who assisted in drafting the proposals, would comment ontheir content. The legislation was put together behind closed doors.   However, a subcommittee staff member, who would not be quoted byname, offered reporters a general outline of the package and saidthe Treasury Department agrees with most of the provisions. Shesaid the subcommittee would take a final look at the package earlynext month.   The proposals would strengthen the ``unrelated-business-incometax,'' which was enacted in 1950 to protect small businessesagainst unfair competition from tax-exempt organizations. Thesubcommittee began drafting the new legislation after months ofcomplaints from businesses that they are still finding it hard tocompete.   Chapoton, testifying before the subcommittee earlier this month,cautioned against any broad overhaul of the tax, but he endorsed aneffort to apply the tax specifically to certain activities oftax-exempt organizations. It was that approach that won preliminaryendorsement of Pickle's subcommittee.   In general, income from gift shops and bookstores operated bytax-exempt organizations would be taxed, with exceptions forlow-cost mementos. The tax would be applied to most catalog andmail-order sales.   A college bookstore could continue to avoid tax on income fromitems that are ``in furtherance of educational programs'' _textbooks, for example _ and on a portion of computer sales tostudents. One subcommittee member said the bookstore could avoidtax on sales of computers to up to half the student body per year,so long as a professor signed a statement that a computer was anecessity for a course.   The tax also would be applied to income from some sales orrental of medical equipment, including hearing aids and oxygentanks. Travel and tour services offered by schools, museums andother non-profit organizations would fall under the tax, as wouldtheir adjunct off-premise food services. The tax would apply tomost hotel facilities that are patronized by the general public.   Authorities have not estimated how much tax would be collectedunder the proposal. However, aides emphasize the package is aimedat improving fairness _ not raising revenue.   At the Ways and Means hearing earlier this month, Frank S.Swain, chief advocacy counsel for the Small BusinessAdministration, said present law has ``allowed non-profits to earnnon-taxable income from activities never contemplated by Congress.... The distinction between the two sections has become blurred _in some instances, beyond recognition.''</TEXT></DOC>
