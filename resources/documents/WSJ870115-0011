The dollar, which has been declining for weeks, went into a steep and sudden fall yesterday against both the West German mark and the Japanese yen.    &quot;It's been the craziest day in a long, long time. People just aren't finding too many reasons to buy dollars,&quot; Peter Wild, a first vice president of Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co. in New York, said.    The continuation of the dollar's decline had been expected after sharp drops earlier this week, but traders expressed surprise at the extent of yesterday's fall. The currency dropped 2.1% against the mark and 1.8% against the yen.    In late New York trading yesterday, the U.S. unit stood at 1.8338 marks, down from 1.8725 Tuesday. The dollar also plunged to 152.77 yen from 155.55.    &quot;The magnitude and swiftness of the move was shocking,&quot; said James T. McGroarty, vice president of foreign-exchange at Discount Corp. of New York. &quot;There was almost a buying panic&quot; in foreign currencies, especially the mark and the yen, he said.    However, at a news conference in Tokyo yesterday, the Bank of Japan's governor, Satoshi Sumita, said the central bank will continue its &quot;determined intervention&quot; in support of the dollar.    Dealers said the Japanese central bank bought $1.5 billion of the U.S. currency in Tokyo trading Wednesday. But the bank then apparently scaled back its support, buying only a few hundred million dollars during New York trading.    &quot;I think the Bank of Japan has changed its method of intervention a little bit,&quot; said Masakazu Miyamori, senior vice president and chief trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd., New York. &quot;They've given up holding the dollar at any one level,&quot; he said, in favor of &quot;smoothing&quot; the currency's decline.    Today is a bank holiday in Japan, and some speculators expect the Bank of Japan to be absent from the market, clearing the way for another sharp decline in the dollar. But some traders familiar with how the central bank operates said it will be back in force.    &quot;I heard Bank of Japan people will come to the office&quot; today, Mr. Miyamori said. He said the central bank reportedly asked some Japanese bank dealers to come in &quot;to help it with its operations.&quot; Otherwise, the Bank of Japan will intervene through other markets, he said.    Dealers partly attributed the dollar's fall yesterday to a New York Times report that the Reagan administration wants the currency to fall further.    The decline began in Japan and continued in Europe, where corporations began &quot;selling out the dollar,&quot; said Roberto Bianchi, a vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich. &quot;They seem to have lost all confidence that central banks will intervene in concerted action,&quot; he said.    The dollar's fall, which reflects doubts that the huge U.S. trade deficit will narrow soon, is intensifying pressure on West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies. Both nations, which have been running huge trade surpluses, have been resisting U.S. pressure to spur domestic demand to absorb a larger share of the world's exports. Bonn and Tokyo worry that the additional stimulus would rekindle domestic inflation.    &quot;It's a big game of chicken,&quot; said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. &quot;The Japanese and West Germans are totally refusing to accept international responsibility. The U.S. is trying to force the issue through the exchange markets. It's risky, but the dangers are greater if the U.S. doesn't succeed.&quot;    Many analysts fear that the U.S. may adopt trade-constricting protectionist policies if its trade deficit doesn't begin to dwindle.    Jack Kessler, a vice president in charge of New York foreign-exchange operations at Chase Manhattan Bank, said the currency market has been focusing on the trade gap. Since the U.S. announced a record $19.2 billion November trade deficit Dec. 31, the dollar has fallen 5.8% against the mark.    But the plunge in the dollar, which will make it more difficult for foreign producers to export to the U.S. and will lower prices of U.S. goods abroad, is stirring concern in Europe. Yesterday, French Economics Minister Edouard Balladur called the slide in the dollar &quot;excessive, unjustified and harmful to the world economy.&quot;    The New York Times yesterday said the Reagan administration had &quot;let it be known&quot; that it wants the dollar to decline still further. The administration quickly denied the report. &quot;We are not attempting to talk down the dollar or in any way trying to influence the markets,&quot; a senior U.S. Treasury official said. He added that it's &quot;not true&quot; that the U.S. wants the dollar to fall faster.    Yesterday's jolt doesn't necessarily mean that the dollar has started a full-fledged tailspin after a long period of gradual decline. Kemper's Mr. Hale, for example, predicts that despite yesterday's plunge, the dollar's value &quot;will go up and down&quot; over the next few weeks.    Some contend that reports about the U.S. possibly encouraging a dollar decline will anger U.S. allies and might risk a dollar slide that could get out of control. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has expressed repeated concern that a &quot;too precipitous&quot; dollar decline could rekindle inflation in the U.S. and choke off the foreign capital that the U.S. needs to finance its deficit. Mr. Volcker reportedly was furious at the Times's report that administration officials were trying to talk the dollar down.    That Times article appeared to be striking at the dollar when it was especially vulnerable -- beset by fears of an enduring U.S. trade deficit and concerns that the mark didn't rise enough in last weekend's realignment of the European Monetary System. Some traders also expressed concern about reports that Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, might be chosen to succeed Mr. Volcker when the Fed chairman's term expires in August. Mr. Sprinkel is known as the architect of the administration's handsoff dollar policy.    &quot;If you talk about Beryl Sprinkel, it's a free fall for the dollar,&quot; one trader said.    Alan Stoga, international economic specialist with Henry Kissinger Associates in New York, says the story appeared &quot;just at a time when the market was looking for reasons to kick the stuffing out of the dollar anyway&quot; and so &quot;had enormous impact, whether they actually were trying to talk the dollar down or not.&quot;    Underlying the dollar's slide is a growing apprehension in the foreign-exchange market that the U.S., West Germany and Japan will prove unable to agree on a plan for reducing their trade imbalances. Stalemate ultimately could bring on a worldwide recession, some analysts fear.    The U.S. had a trade deficit of about $170 billion last year, while West Germany and Japan had surpluses of $51 billion and $86 billion, respectively.    &quot;These are totally unsustainable,&quot; said Robert Hormats, a former State Department economic official. He warned that protectionist pressures will become unbearable unless the imbalances are reduced. Adverse U.S. trade-deficit estimates for November gave little sign of hope.    The U.S. wants Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies with interestrate and tax cuts. Although Bonn and Tokyo continue to dispute it, most analysts argue that both countries have plenty of room for faster growth. West Germany already has an 8.9% unemployment rate and is heavily dependent on exports to Europe and the U.S.; its economic boom is fading; interest rates are unusually high; and business activity is slowing visibly. Worse yet, because they're so dependent on West German trade, other European countries such as France and Britain can't spur their own economies until Bonn acts.    Japan also is in the doldrums, plagued by relatively high unemployment and interest rates and no real program for bailing out its economy. Both countries have enormous trade and balance-of-payments surpluses. Under international economic rules, countries that have big surpluses bear as much responsibility for reducing their imbalances as those with large deficits.    Some analysts have expected West Germany to spur its economy right after its Jan. 25 parliamentary elections. But there are suggestions from Bonn that Washington's willingness to let the dollar slide further have only hardened the resolve of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government not to give in to U.S. pressure. Most analysts also predict Japan will be slow to stimulate its economy in any case.    The U.S. willingness to see the dollar decline also is embarrassing Japan, which agreed last fall to cut its discount rate and overhaul its tax system if the U.S. would stop trying to nudge the dollar down against the yen. Japan confirmed yesterday that Toyoo Gyoten, vice minister of finance and the country's leading international economic negotiator, will be meeting with U.S. officials next week to discuss the currency situation. He already had been planning to come to Washington to speak at a conference.    Traders say the dollar is also under pressure because of slow economic growth in the U.S. Pessimism about the U.S. economy was reinforced by yesterday's Commerce Department report on retail sales in December.    Although sales rose 4.4%, traders reacted negatively because the report followed a downward revision of the November sales number, to a decrease of 0.6% instead of a 0.5% rise, and because non-auto sales rose only 0.9%.    On economic factors alone, many traders say they see the dollar falling to between 140 and 145 yen and to between 1.7 and 1.8 marks by mid-year.    ---                     CURRENCY RATES                       New York    Home Mkt.
