It's aquestion of where do you want to plaace your emphasis.andP;  i beleive it's morefruitful at this stage of evolution of open systems to focus on theinteroperability side of this.&quot;andM;And Smith is not alone.andP;  Even usera who have chosen to standardize on UNIXsay the operating system is just one part of the issue.andP;  DHL Airways Inc.,andO;for example, made a corporatewide decision nearly four years ago to migrateall of its key applications from a collection of IBM mainframes and System/36mini-computers to a variety of UNIX systems from vendors such as ATandamp;T,Hewlett-Packard Co., NCR Corp, and Pyramid Technology Corp.andP;  As a result, theRedwood City, Calif., company has won a reputation as one of a growing numberof corporate UNIX champions.andM;&quot;But there's a lot more to the strategy than just UNIX,&quot; says Larry Sikin,director of advanced technology for DHL in New York.andP;  &quot;UNIX is just theoperating system.andP;  It's not the whole environment.andP;  It's not your data; it'snot your communications.andP;  Those are equally big pieces of the total computingenvironment.&quot;andM;Using their spending power for leverage, users are increasingly puttingpressure on their vendors to broaden their definitions of open systems beyondUNIX.andP;  Users are saying they want standard Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)implementation profiles and test suites, not just broad specifications.andP;  Theywant standard data definitions that they can use to create distributedapplications spanning computers of many flavors.andP;  They want industrywidedatabase interface definitions so they can mix and match relational databasesand development tools such as fourth-generation language (4GLs) as easily asthey can combine UNIX hardware platforms today.andP;  They want a single, standardgraphical user interface.andP;  They want standard object management acrossheterogenerous environments.andP;  And they want standard network managementprotocols that can be used to run complex networks of hundreds and thousandsof different types of devices.andM;It all adds up to users demanding a whole new set of standard interfaces thatdwell above and link operating system environments.andP;  &quot;We're trying to look atopenng our systems at a much higher level,&quot; says Terry Jones, vice presidentfor product development at American Airlines Inc.'s SABRE computerreservation system division.andM;American Airlines is a classic example of a large corporation with everythingto gain from embracing a broad definition of open systems.andP;  The companyoperates what it has publicly called one of the best and largest closedsystems in the world in its SABRE (for Semi-Automated Business ReservationEnvironment) automated ticket reservation system, which handles 2,000messages per second.andP;  In an effort to gain control over that massivetransaction load over the years, AA has built a highly centralized suite of17,000 programs on seven IBM 3090 mainframes running IBM'stransaction-oriented Airline Control Program (ACP) sub-system.andP;  According toJones, American Airlines would like nothing better than to distribute thoseapplications over networks of heterogenous systems, including UNIX.andM;&quot;We're seeing such incredible, powerful hardware coming out from the vendorsof the RISC engines and some of the CISC engines,&quot; says Jones of the hardwarecoming on the market that incorporates either reduced or complex instructionset computing.andP;  &quot;A UNIX is the platform that they're chosen to build on.&quot;andM;But American Airlines is not prepared simply to discard its million ofdollars' worth of SABRE software and attempt to replace it with an operatingenvironment that, while more economical, may noy be the functional equivalentof today's closed system.andP;  American Airlines needs to deliver 2,000 messagesper second, period.andP;  &quot;We really can't find anything today that we can just gobuy that will do that and that is an open architecture,&quot; says Jones.andM;So the SABRE division is attempting to clear its own path, Jones says.andO;First, SABRE is migrating all of its applications froms the highlyspecialized ACT subsystem to the more mainstream IBM mainframe subsystemTransaction Processing Facility (TPF).andP;  At the end of this year, SABRE willattempt to uncouple selected applications from TPF and run them in differentmainframe environments.andP;  &quot;We have 6.5 million customer profiles, forexample,&quot; says Jones.andP;  &quot;They're text files.andP;  They don't need to be in ahighspeed TPF engine.andP;  They need to be in a database machine.&quot;andM;The challenge will then be for SABRE to link its remaining centralized TPFapplications with those that have been spun out to database and otherenvironments in such a way that applications can communicate transparentlywith each other on line.andP;  Today, says Jones, SABRE can't buy tha capabilityfrom any vendor, open or closed.andM;&quot;To us, getting to a point where we can break apart a monolith and have theinteroperability and still have the speed is real important,&quot; says Jones.andP;  Heestimates that all the extra seconds operators spend making reservations onSABRE cost American Airlines $1 million a year.andM;Users like Jones are hammering away at vendors of UNIX and proprietarysystems alike with the message that they want to be able to buyinteroperability, not have to build it from scratch.andP;  &quot;And I think the UNIXvendors are starting to catch on.andP;  The understand that the DP industry inmany ways is more mature, and they're selling into installed bases wherecorporations aren't willing to put up with throwing everything out on thestreet and starting over.andP;  They won't do it,&quot; says Jones.andM;Users say if open systems vendors provide the kind of interoperability theywant, those vendors will have a chance to do every bit as well in the ISworld as they've already done in the engineering, scientific and smallbusiness/departmental computing markets.andP;  If they don't, IS is likely to lookat open systems as just another buzzword.andM;&quot;If all you're giving me is private protocols between UNIX systems that willnot operate with .andP;  .  .  IBM systems, then you're forcing me to play chickenwith IBM....andP;  You're not giving me a graceful way to introduce newtechnologies,&quot; says BofA's Smith.andM;The Case for UNIXandM;Even though the open systems movement is just beginning to understand IS'need for interoperability, there's no arguing with the success UNIX vendorshave enjoyed in recent years selling the aadvantages of software portabilityprimarily to small business, departmental and engineering users.andO;International Data Corp. reports that by 1988 UNIX-based systems had alreadyaccounted for 9% of the $121 billion computer systems market.andP;  By 1993, theFramingham, Mass.-based market research firm expects UNIX to account for 19%of aa $185 billion industry.andP;  That would make UNIX a $35 billion market inits own right, equal in size, in IDC's estimation, to the market for IBMSystem 370-claass mainframes in 1993.andM;Not bad for an operating system that was developed primarily for softwaredevelopers and spent its early life in universities and research labs,nowhere near the center of mission-critical IS applications.andP;  In recentyears, increasing numbers of commercial users have latched onto UNIX mainlyas a way to cash in on stunning price/performance improvements offered byRISC and other new architectures.andP;  ATandamp;T's willingness to license UNIXrelatively freely and the increasingly popularity of its System Vimplementation have created a critical mass of sorts in support of UNIX andconvinced many commercial users that they would be able to buy one UNIX-basedsystem and move their applications to another easily should the need everarise.andM;One such UNIX user is $55 million Citation Insurance Co. of San Jose, which ayear aago threw out several proprietary systems from Alpha Microsystems andreplaced them with four Sun Microsystems Inc. servers and ASCII terminalsrunning applications on a Sybase Inc. relational database management systemover an industry standard TCP/IP network.andM;According to Citation's director of database administration, Bill Alsop, theinsurer had tried a couple of proprietary approaches to allow IS to keep upwith its rapidly expanding workers' compensation insurance business.andP;  Butwhen those efforts failed, Citation decided to convert all of itsapplications to UNIX with the expectation that the company will migrate fromthe Sun servers to something larger--such as a multiprocessor machine fromSequent Computer Systems Inc.--when the time comes.andP;  &quot;UNIX and Sybase shouldmake that possible,&quot; says Alsop.andM;Commercial users choosing UNIX are attracted by its usefulness in distributedclient-server systems as well as its price/performance.andP;  Wall Streetbrokerage firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., for example, has decided inprinciple to develop new applications in four key functional areas on top ofUNIX, TCP/IP and the Sybase DBMS.andP;  The projects could result in theinstallation of 800 client-server workstations and terminals worldwide.andM;With its strength in multitasking, UNIX fits well in a client-serverarchitecture, says David Sherr, who is running the open systems projects forShearson.andP;  A client-server architecture gives Shearson the power to imposeapplications rules and structures only once, at the server.andP;  That means&quot;applications programmers only worry about business transactions, not systemstransactions,&quot; says Sherr.andM;And, compared with proprietary systems, the price/performance advantagesoffered by UNIX boxes give Shearson the extra MIPS to devote to power hungrygraphical user interfaces, with plenty of savings left over.andP;  &quot;Right now,I've got three major vendors all saying, 'I will not be beaten on price.'andP;  Ifit weren't for the fact that I was on a UNIX platform, guess what?andP;  Thatwouldn't be happening,&quot; says Sherr.andM;But Sherr, like his brethren in other large corporations, says standardizingon UNIX alone does not bring all of the interoperability or even the softwareportability that large users expect from an open environment.andP;  Users needstandard interfaces at very link in the applications architecture chain, saysSherr.andP;  And most large users--especially those needing to link nonproprietarysystems with existing proprietary systems--are finding those interfaces justaren't there yet.andM;Sherr says he and other IS executives communicated these facts loudly andclearly to vendors last June at what many in the industry are calling aseminal meeting of the X/Open open systems consortium in Montreal.andP;  X/OpenCo. Ltd., like most of the growing number of open systems-oriented consortia,has been viewed by many users as vendor dominated.andP;  Although X/Open maintainsa small advisory user council, vendors provide the financing and have theonly policy-making votes.andM;&quot;Requirements Conference&quot;andM;In June, however, the group decided to bring together over 100 users andvendors in what X/Open called an open systems &quot;requirements conference.&quot;andP;  Theresult, according to Sherr and others, was dramatic.andP;  Not only did theconference produce 117 detailed open systems technical requirements but italso served to shift the balance of power within X/Open away from vendorstoward users.andP;  The focus of the group also shifted to interoperability andinterconnection rather than UNIX and software portability, according toSherr.andM;&quot;Many people--especially vendors--went into that meeting thinking opensystems was about only operating systems,&quot; recalls Sherr.andP;  &quot;But when wereally sat down with them and started articulating these user interfaceissues, these database issues, they began to realize that, really, theoperating system is becoming a relatively small piece of it....andP;  Thecommunity interest eventually focused on the guy who puts up the dollars.andO;And that turns out to be the end user.&quot;andM;That shift was reflected in a document published by X/Open in late January.andO;Called &quot;The Open System Directive,&quot; it spells out the need for vendors andX/Open, through its standards-based Common Applications Environment (CAE), tobroaden the open systems focus beyond UNIX.andP;  &quot;The CAE is viewed as based onUNIX operating systems,&quot; the directive notes.andP;  &quot;It should be expanded so thatit is truly open-systems-based.andP;  There is a need for standards outside UNIXoperating systems and for a coordination and integration of other standardsefforts.... Interoperability is a key area.andP;  UNIX operating systems are onlya component of open systems, and the industry needs an authoritative voicethat addresses all the portability aspects of open systems--includinginterconnection and interoperability,&quot; the 224-page directive concludes.andM;The X/Open document spells out users' strong need for a number ofinteroperability-oriented standards.andP;  Among them:andM;* A single interface for systems administration services across operatingsystems;andM;* A set of application-programming interfaces for implementing high-level OSInetwork services;andM;* An application-transparent remote procedure call service andapplication-programming interface;andM;* A cross-environment data management scheme, such as a data repository, toenable support for many 4GLs on a single relational database managment system(RDBMS).andM;X/Open is not alone in coming to such conclusions.andP;  Increasingly, otherconsortia, such as the Object Management Group and the Open SoftwareFoundation, are also planning for open systems in a not exclusively UNIXworld.andM;A Standard View of DataandM;A recent survey by the Phoenix-based Sierra Group underscores the concerns ofthe users attending the X/Open requirements conference.andP;  Large corporate userorganizations, when asked to rate the importance of UNIX on a scale of one to10, with 10 being the highest score, ranked the operating system at three, orfifth from the bottom on the group's list of issues.andP;  The same users gave OSIa four, on a par with IBM's Systems Application Architecture environment.andM;That's in line with the priorities at BofA, where the drive to open systemsis starting not with operating systems but with OSI and with establishing astandard view of the corporation's data.andM;Currently, the bank supports major applications in such diverse environmentsas IBM's Customer Information and Control System (CICS), InformationManagement System (IMS) and TPF subsystems, plus Digital Equipment Corp.'sVAX/VMS and Tandem Computers Inc.'s Guardian operating systems.andP;  According toBofA's Smith, the bank's goal is to be able to integrate customer informationfrom all of those environments.andM;But, in order for that to happen, applications in all of those environmentsmust use the same communications protocols and also agree on certain datadefinitions.andP;  For example, what is a customer?andP;  What constitutes anelectronic funds transfer?andM;To address this issue, BofA has taken a leading role in efforts made throughthe American National Standards Institute to create standard data definitionsfor transaction-processing applications.andP;  Once such data standards arecreated and standard OSI implementations are available, &quot;I can begin theexecution of a transaction that spans two open systems,&quot; says Smith.andP;  &quot;One ofthese [systems] doesn't need to know what operating system the other one isusing.... What is session-visible is what's important here.&quot;andM;Once such standards are in place, a large corporation like BofA could evenstart introducing new operating systems into its architecture without alsointroducing new layers of complexity and unwanted choices.andP;  &quot;That would allowme to gradually integrate a UNIX platform into a larger community oftransaction processing that may or may not be built on a UNIX platform,&quot; saysSmith.andM;Smith is optimistic that the ISO will settle on an international standard fortransaction processing within the next 18 months.andP;  Mainstream products usingthe standard should be available in another 18 months to three years, hepredicts.andP;  Similar data standards for other businesses, such as manufacturingand the insurance industry, are also in the works.andM;What Users Have TodayandM;In the meantime, however, most IS executives say they can't buycommunications products that offer acceptable functionality andinteroperability.andP;  While some vendors like Digital have made progress towardtheir promise of migrating their proprietary networks to OSI, users say mostOSI offerings are still incomplete.andP;  And, worse, early experience indicatesthat there are usually big differences between individual vendors' OSIimplementations.andP;  That means OSI products from different vendors may or maynot work together.andM;&quot;Right now, we're facing a bunch of immature [OSI] products and a lack ofconformance testing,&quot; says Ron Skelton, director of telecom strategies forAetna Life andamp; Casualty Co. in Hartford, Conn.andP;  &quot;As a result, in a market wherewe should be guaranteed interoperability, we are now surprised if twoproducts we buy are able to work together.&quot;andM;Aetna so far is continuing to use a combination of IBM Systems NetworkArchitecture and DECNet networks.andP;  At the same time, Aetna and several otherinsurance companies have created a task force to determine standard datadefinitions for transaction applications that can be used on heterogeneoussystems across the industry.andP;  The project, which parallels BofA's efforts inbanking transactions, is called Bright Light.andP;  &quot;We think we can make realprogress there, so we are putting a lot of effort there,&quot; says Skelton.andM;The problem with OSI today, users say, is that the seven-layer standarddefined by the ISO doesn't specify how OSI networks will be implemented.andP;  Andthe standard leaves room for different implementation choices at each layer.andO;Therefore, any vendor's OSI product implementation may or may not operatewith that of any other vendor.andM;Some large users have attempted to take matters into their own hands.andO;General Motors Corp., for example, has taken a leading, if not altogethereffective, role in promoting the Manufacturing Automation Protocol/TechnicalOffice Protocol (MAP/TOP) as the OSI implementation for manufacturing.andP;  (See&quot;Manufacturing Automation's Problem,&quot; November 15, 1989, p. 32.)andP;  In otherapplication areas, however, no such standard implementation exists at all.andM;Many users are hoping the situation will improve once the U.S.andP;  governmentbegins specifying and buying OSI products in large quantities.andP;  In fact,beginning this August, government agencies installing new electronic mail andfile transfer applications will be required to specify an OSI implementationdefined by version 1 of the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile,generally referred to as GOSIP.andP;  Many observers, however, doubt that vendorswill be ready to deliver GOSIP-compliant products by August.andP;  &quot;You're goingto see a lot of waivers after August,&quot; predicts Dan Lynch, president ofInterop Inc. (formerly Advanced Computing Environments), a consulting firmspecializing in communications.andM;X/Open's call for a standard application programming interface for OSInetwork services could also help solve that problem.andP;  And a couple of othervendor consortia are working in the same direction.andP;  One, called the OSINetwork Management Forum, is trying to come up with standard OSIimplementations for network management, including a repository.andM;The group seems to be gaining momentum.andP;  It started out almost two years agowith only eight members and since has grown to 85, including IBM and Digital.andO;Participants say they expect vendors to start shipping products that complywith Forum specifications as early as this fall.andM;Another group, dubbed the X.400 Application Program Interface Association, ispromoting a standard API for OSI X.400 electronic mail and X.500 electronicdirectory services.andM;Migrating to OSIandM;Meanwhile, some users such as Shearson, are opting for the de facto standard,the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networkingscheme, with the intention in the long term of migrating to OSI.andP;  Thequestion for those users, then, becomes how to do the migration.andP;  Some usersare considering supporting dual protocol stacks on top of the same lowerlevel kernel.andP;  Others are maintaining TCP for some applications and OSI forothers, with gateways in between.andP;  Both approaches have their problems, suchas having to manage two different networks and having to ask programmers towrite to two different APIs.andM;Experts, however, say a third option may soon make migration easier.andP;  Thenext release of the BSD version of UNIX from the University of California atBerkeley will reportedly include a layer of software running on top of TCP ofTCP/IP that will allow users to run OSI applications at the session layer andabove.andP;  That code will be publicly licensed and come with tools and acompiler, as well as some OSI application code.andM;That's all very nice, some users say, but just give us an OSI that works.andO;&quot;TCP/IP is a 10 to 15-year-old technology that has surfaced much too late inthe game to be of much use to commercial users,&quot; says Aetna's Skelton.andP;  Or,as BofA's Smith says, &quot;We're keeping our SNA powder dry.&quot;andM;In addition to interoperability standards for communications, users are alsopushing hard for standards at the data management level.andP;  Most users seekingto develop UNIX-based open systems today--particularly those developingclient-server and transaction-oriented applications--are actually writingtheir software on top of one of a handful of relational database managementsystems.andP;  Those RDBMSs today use different implementations of StructuredQuery Language, different methods for distributing SQL statements on anetwork, different error codes and different ways of embedding SQL statementsin programs of other languages, such as C.andM;That all adds up to the fact that applications and data written to one RDBMScannot easily operate with others.andP;  It also means that 4GLS are not portablebetween RDBMSs, so applications written in a 4GL for one database environmentmust stay there.andP;  Users that jump to UNIX seeking freedom and portabilityoften discover that they are locked in to a particular RDBMS that may or maynot offer the performance or functions they will need in the long term.andM;&quot;In the old days, vendors locked users in at the operating system andhardware level.andP;  Today it's being done at the 4GL and database [level],&quot; saysRoger Sippl, chairman of Informix Software Inc.andM;Users couldn't agree more.andP;  &quot;Vendors may be leading us into a new era ofvendor lock-in,&quot; Aetna's Skelton maintains, by building proprietary hooksinto database management systems and then often linking those systems to aproprietary operating system, as IBM has done with its OS/2 and otherproducts.andM;In order to avoid lock-in at the data management level, some userorganizations, including Shearson, have gone to the trouble of building theirown virtual interface software layers into their environments.andP;  For example,Shearson's custom interface layer makes data management services look thesame to all applications.andP;  That means Shearson could move from Sybase toInformix, for example, with minimal conversion effort.andM;&quot;We're going with products that are there now, but we don't want to bindourselves to them forever,&quot; says Sherr.andP;  &quot;So we keep that [software] layerthere, and we pay the price.&quot;andP;  The price, says Sherr, goes beyond theconsiderable effort involved in developing and maintaining the interfaces.andO;Between 10 and 20% of Shearson's CPU power is needed just to accommodate theextra software layer.andM;Many users are simply unwilling to develop and maintain those kinds of custominterfaces.andP;  They'd rather their vendors built interoperability into theirproducts.andM;With that in mind, yet another vendor consortium was recently formed to focuson data management standards and interoperability.andP;  The SQL Access Group isfocused on promoting a common SQL implementation, as well as other databasestandards that would make it easier for users to mix and match RDBMSs withina network and use tools such as 4GLs in more than one RDBMS environment.andP;  Thegroup includes such vendors as Digital, HP, Oracle Corp. and Sun.andP;  But so farIBM and Sybase have stayed away.andM;Some users and some vendors also see object management as a useful tool forpromoting openness through interoperability.andP;  American Airlines recentlydecided to implement a large integrated office automation application on PCsrunning Hewlett-Packard's New Wave object-oriented programming environment.andO;&quot;Something like New Wave does serve a purpose in terms of interoperabilitybecause it hides everything behind the scenes so a user doesn't have to worryabout it,&quot; says the airline's Jones.andM;New Wave is tied to a standard system for managing the distribution ofobjects between applications running on computers with different operatingsystems.andP;  So, theoretically, a PS/2 system running OS/2 could access data andexecute applications located on a proprietary HP MPE mini-computer, forexample.andM;The networked version of New Wave is still in development, but already somevendors, including Data General Corp., have agreed to use a version of HP'sobject management facility in their own products.andP;  &quot;Rather than trying toexploit our proprietary advantage, we're licensing the current New Waveproduct to other companies,&quot; says HP New Wave manager Bill Crowe.andP;  &quot;We've putthis technology on the table, and we're actively participating with otherorganizations like X/Open and OSF.&quot;andM;Step By StepandM;HP is one vendor that does seem to be listening when its users say that UNIXis not enough.andP;  Speaking to an audience of UNIX true believers in a recentkeynote speech at the Uniforum trade show, HP chairman and chief executiveofficer John Young said: &quot;Too often our industry delivers open systemsproducts that assume customers are starting from scratch in putting togethertheir information systems ...andP;  when in reality they're sitting on billions ofdollars' worth of proprietary systems, software and databases they've alreadybought.andP;  So we need some bridge products to span the gap between new and old.andO;And instead of asking customers to cross the chasm with a leap of faith, weneed to help them do it step by step.&quot;andM;HP may be ahead of many vendors in realizing that fact, but at the same time,there are some observers who believe other vendors are beginning to get themessage, too.andP;  &quot;For a long time, it's seemed like users and vendors have beenhaving two different conversations about open systems,&quot; says Marc Schulman,an analyst with UBS Securities Inc. in New York City.andP;  &quot;What ISVs[independent software vendors] have meant by open is, 'Is the [UNIX] sourcecode available?'andP;  But that has very little to do with open from the user'spoint of view.andP;  He wants to know, 'Can I move my applications around?'andP;  Opensystems and UNIX are not synonymous.andP;  For ISVs and vendors, it hasn't beenfashionable to come out and say that.andP;  But I'm convinced that's exactly theconclusion they're coming to--with the help of users, of course.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
