Gajda </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> INS PHA </IN><TEXT>   It is good for consumers to save some of their income, because savings is investment and investment leads to improved technology, means of production, etc. But if all consumers save a large part of their incomes, there will be no demand for goods and services and the economy will contract, if not collapse. This is called the paradox of thrift.    There may also be a paradox of long-term-care insurance. While virtually unheard of a few years ago, and while employees are paying the full premiums, long-term-care insurance programs are now being introduced by major employers. An examination of demand and supply in the long-term-care market suggests there is a very rough road ahead if many people buy the insurance and demand keeps increasing at a faster rate than supply.    On the demand side, research shows the probability of a nursing-home confinement is 1% between ages 65 and 74, 7% between ages 75 and 84, and 23% after age 84. The Commerce Department has estimated that between 1980 and the year 2000, the population aged 65 to 74 will grow 10%, the population aged 75 to 84 will grow 71%, and the population aged 85 and over will grow 124%. This will increase demand for nursing-home beds 86% by the year 2000, if nothing else happens.    But other things will happen.    The potentially largest influence on demand will be future successes in treating acute medical conditions. As medicine is more successful in treating such conditions, people will have more opportunities to acquire the chronic conditions that lead to nursing-home confinement.    Another factor is Medicare's conversion, in 1983, to a reimbursement system that encourages hospitals to discharge patients more quickly, either to their own homes or to nursing homes. Because Medicare is increasing its reimbursement to hospitals at a slower rate than the probable growth in hospital outlays, there will be even greater economic incentives for hospitals to discharge patients early.    In addition, with the recent resurgence of high inflation in hospital and physician fees, many employee benefit plans will increase their efforts to have employees and their dependents treated in lower-cost nursing homes. Also, the spread of AIDS may influence the demand for nursing-home beds.    If a significant portion of the population obtains long-term-care insurance during the next 12 years, there will be still further increases in the demand for nursing-home care. And recently, Sen. Edward Kennedy announced that he will introduce legislation creating a national long-term-care program. His &quot;Lifecare,&quot; funded by the combination of an increase in the Social Security tax base to $75,000 from $45,000 and participant premium payments, would also accelerate the market dynamics.    The conditions on the supply side are not reassuring:   The Task Force on Long-Term Health Care Policies, appointed by Otis Bowen, secretary of health and human services, estimated last year that there was a shortage of 250,000 nursing-home beds. This should be reflected in escalating costs.    Between 1966 and 1982, the cost of nursing-home care increased 15.1% a year. Further, although the number of nursing-home beds increased 13% between 1976 and 1982, the ratio of nursing-home beds to the over-65 population fell 2.8%. The Health Care Financing Administration estimated last year that long-term-care costs would increase an average 9.3% annually between 1986 and 1990. While the estimate may turn out to be wishful thinking, it is still a significant rate of increase.    Long-term-care insurance covers home health-care services as well, which often can substitute for nursing-home care. However, there is serious concern today about home health care. Home health-care workers are low-paid and receive few, if any, fringe benefits. It is easy to imagine the same kind of groundswell of public support forming for home health workers that was demonstrated for hospital workers in the 1960s and postal workers in the early 1970s. If that happens, costs are bound to surge. Absent a public reaction, the shortage of nurses, nursing-related personnel and home health workers will be sufficient to raise costs.    Given these demand and supply conditions, price inflation is inevitable.    Today, nearly half of all nursing-home costs are paid directly by patients, many of whom become impoverished and who then must rely on Medicaid. Medicaid currently pays about 40% of all costs. Increased public awareness of the devastating costs of nursing home care has led to increased demand for long-term-care insurance and has driven employees and retirees to enroll in long-term-care insurance programs. We are seeing the beginnings of that process today:   --When a long-term-care program was made available to retired employees of the state of Alaska, 3,450 out of 6,800 eligible retirees applied for coverage.    --When Procter andamp; Gamble sponsored a plan, 15% of all active employees enrolled, including 20% of employees age 30 to 39 and 20% of employees age 40 to 49.    As an employee benefit, long-term-care insurance currently is being examined, designed, communicated and financed as a microeconomic issue. But such insurance will, along with other influences, drive up the cost of care, thereby producing more horror stories, thereby increasing demand for insurance, and on and on.    Once long-term-care insurance becomes a staple in the fringe-benefits package, it's unlikely that employers will rescind access to it because of price inflation. The employer will reason that the denial of such benefits by a single company will not alter the future, and may earn that employer an undesirable label in the present. Further, since current long-term-care insurance premiums are paid for entirely by employees and retirees, an employer has little incentive to deny access to benefits for &quot;the good of society.&quot;    At that point the vicious cycle will be virtually impossible to break.    ---   Mr. Gajda is a principal of Mercer Meidinger Hansen Inc., a leading employee benefits consulting firm.
