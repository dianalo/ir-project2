A new, nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted last Saturday through Monday shows that the Democratic presidential nominee holds a lead of 51% to 34% over Vice President Bush among those voters most likely to vote in November. This margin of 17 percentage points is up from the 12-point edge Mr. Dukakis held in a Journal/NBC poll conducted just before the convention.    In particular, the survey shows that Mr. Dukakis is doing well among two groups that together form a critical voting bloc. These are strictly independent voters -- those who normally lean toward neither party -- and the self-described Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984. Mr. Dukakis leads the vice president among both groups, which together account for about 27% of the likely electorate; among Reagan Democrats, he enjoys a huge 4-to-1 lead.    Conventions often give a candidate a boost in the polls, but such increases usually prove ephemeral. Moreover, Vice President Bush can probably look forward to a boost of his own following the Republican National Convention next month.    Still, the Journal/NBC survey demonstrates that Mr. Dukakis largely succeeded in his difficult balancing act of keeping the party happy without appearing to important segments of the electorate to be pandering to the party's various factions.    Among those likely voters who knew something about the Democratic convention, nearly four times as many said the convention made them more likely to vote for Mr. Dukakis as said it made them less likely to vote for him. About half said the convention wouldn't affect their vote.    Mr. Dukakis's favorability ratings -- a standard measure of how candidates are perceived by the electorate -- were clearly bolstered by the convention. In the new poll, 62% of all likely voters said they have a favorable opinion of the Massachusetts governor, while 18% have an unfavorable opinion -- a spread of 44 points. In the previous Journal/NBC poll, which was conducted the week before the convention opened, the figures were 58% to 25%, a 33-point spread.    In contrast, Mr. Bush -- widely pilloried in such Democratic speeches as Sen. Edward Kennedy's &quot;Where Was George?&quot; broadside -- is viewed favorably by 44% of likely voters and viewed unfavorably by 46%. Two weeks ago, 49% had a favorable opinion of him and 42% had an unfavorable view.    The poll also showed that Mr. Dukakis pulled ahead of the vice president on the question of which man the voters would rather see in the White House in case of a sudden crisis requiring swift, decisive action. The question is a vital one to the vice president, since a cornerstone of his strategy is to stress his greater foreign-policy experience and paint himself as the steadier hand in a crisis.    Two weeks ago Mr. Bush narrowly led the Democratic candidate on the question by 44% to 40%. In the new poll, Mr. Dukakis leads, 51% to 41%. And likely voters agreed by a margin of almost three to one with the statement that Mr. Dukakis &quot;is a strong leader who is willing to make tough decisions.&quot;    Many voters found Mr. Dukakis adroit in his handling of Jesse Jackson, his defeated rival for the Democratic presidential nomination. Three-quarters of all likely voters in the Journal/NBC survey believe that Mr. Jackson was treated fairly at the convention. Nearly two-thirds said Mr. Dukakis treated the civil-rights leader &quot;about right,&quot; while 12% believe the nominee gave in too much and 14% think he didn't give in enough.    However, a plurality of voters -- 45% -- think Mr. Dukakis made &quot;a lot of private promises&quot; to win Mr. Jackson's support.    Mr. Jackson clearly remains a polarizing force to some of the electorate, but 49% of likely voters now have a favorable view of him, while 40% have an unfavorable one. Should Mr. Dukakis win the fall election, 23% of voters believe that Mr. Jackson would have &quot;a great deal&quot; of influence in his administration -- but only 14% think he should have that much influence.    At the same time, 55% of likely voters would favor seeing Mr. Jackson appointed to a cabinet position in a Dukakis administration, while 31% would oppose such an appointment.    By a margin of 54% to 19%, the Journal/NBC poll shows, voters approve of Mr. Dukakis's selection of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen to be his vice presidential running mate. Voters don't yet know much about Sen. Bentsen, the poll found: Nearly half aren't sure whether they have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of him. Among voters who do have an opinion, though, those who view him favorably outnumber those with an unfavorable view by more than two to one.    The poll shows that Mr. Dukakis now has a lead of 56% to 26% -- better than two to one -- over Vice President Bush among women likely to vote. Mr. Dukakis also leads among men likely to vote, although only by a margin of 46% to 43%. The Massachusetts governor continues to lead in every part of the country, and since the Bentsen selection and the convention Mr. Dukakis has widened his margin in the South -- Mr. Bush's strongest region -- to 13 points from five in the preconvention poll.    The poll clearly shows Mr. Dukakis's success so far in wooing back to the fold the Democrats who supported Mr. Reagan against Walter Mondale four years ago. Not only does he lead Mr. Bush by a 67%-17% margin among such voters, but seven in 10 of them agree that he is a strong leader.    Moreover, 49% of such voters who heard or read about the Democratic convention said it made them more likely to vote for the governor, while only 9% said it made them less likely to support him.    Mr. Dukakis also leads in the poll among independent voters, by a margin of 38% to 29%. But many of these voters -- one in three -- aren't sure how they would vote if the election were held today.    These independent voters split almost evenly on the question of which man they want to see as president in a crisis, 45% choosing Mr. Bush and 42% Mr. Dukakis. But by a margin of better than two to one, they agree that Mr. Dukakis is a strong leader.    As a rough barometer of sentiment among those voters who are still most up for grabs, The Wall Street Journal designed a &quot;swing group.&quot; The group includes independent voters, Democrats and Republicans who are undecided about their vote this year, and those Democrats who voted for President Reagan in 1984 and still approve of his performance as president. The group comprises over 25% of all likely voters.    According to the poll, this group agrees, by a margin of 58% to 21%, with the statement that &quot;Michael Dukakis is a strong leader who is willing to make tough decisions.&quot; In addition, this &quot;swing group&quot; gives Mr. Dukakis a favorability ratio of 56% to 14% -- significantly better than Mr. Bush's 47% to 34% ratio.    ---   &quot;DO YOU have a favorable or unfavorable of opinon of Michael Dukakis?&quot;                                July 23-25       July 8-11    Favorable                     62%              58%    Unfavorable                   18%              25%    The Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll   &quot;Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of George Bush?&quot;                               July 23-25       July 8-11     Favorable                   44%              49%     Unfavorable                 46%              42%</TEXT></DOC>
