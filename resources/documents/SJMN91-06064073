While the future ofthe project looks bleak now, we're not ready to give up on it.;    In 1978,Palo Alto voters passed a 5 percent utility tax with the understanding thatpart of the money would be used to lease Cubberley from the Palo Alto schooldistrict and turn it into a community center. The master plan calls forathletic fields, two swimming pools, dance studios, artist studios, a theater,a band shell, classrooms -- the works.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  A CUBBERLEY STRATEGYAPPROVE A MASTER PLAN WITH CLEAR PRIORITIES,AND BEGIN FUND RAISING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     Then reality set in. The project which was supposed to cost $12 million nowis estimated at $18 million. Available tax revenues estimated at $7 millionhave been revised to just $3.5 million. That's barely enough to bringCubberley up to code without any added bells or whistles.;    Recent bad newsabout the city's budget only makes matters worse.;    This poses a dilemma forthe city council: It can't approve a pie-in-the-sky master plan without someway to pay for it. Yet it has an obligation to the people of Palo Alto, whovoted for the utility tax thinking they would get a citywide community center.If it turns out that the center will be used only by the surroundingneighborhood and a few special-interest groups, the voters may refuse toextend the tax when it comes up for renewal. That would be bad news for theschool district and the community.;    The council's best bet is to approve amaster plan with clear priorities and a long time line. In the meantime, beginan aggressive fund-raising campaign, hitting up local corporations andcommunity groups as well as foundations. It won't be easy because funding forarts groups is hard to find these days.;    But a smart campaign could sellthe center as a benefit to the entire region, its workers and residents, foryears to come. To settle for less without a fight would be a mistake.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910304  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  355  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday March 4, 199100064073,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
