CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Roman Catholic high schools, once taught mainlyby nuns and religious brothers but now staffed mainly by layteachers, still are making a special impact on students.   A study finds they're more concerned for others and morecritical of militarism than public school students. However,Catholic students are less enthusiastic about school, perhapsbecause it's tougher.   These are among findings of a comparative analysis done by aresearch center, the Search Institute of Minneapolis, of an annualgovernment survey of 16,000 high school seniors.   The examination of effects of schools on student values, beliefsand behaviors, commissioned by the National Catholic EducationalAssociation, turned up these conclusions:   _ That seniors in Catholic schools have stronger pro-marriageattitudes and indicate more concern for others, including greaterwilingness to contribute money to help them, than do their publicschool counterparts.   _ That the Catholic students are less supportive of militaryprograms than public school students, suggesting a shift inCatholic thinking which once was most solidly supportive of themilitary.   _ That Catholic seniors, in terms of faith and churchdedication, are more religious than public school students, asmeasured by church attendance, contributions and degree ofimportance attached to religion.   _ That paradoxically, while the Catholic seniors are moreconsistently determined to get a college education, they have aless positive attitude toward school now than do public schoolstudents.   The researchers suggested that the Catholic students' edginessabout their present school experience is because of its morerigorous academic demands.   Of the overall results, Michael Guerra, executive director ofthe NCEA's secondary schools department, said the ``evidenceclearly demonstrates that Catholic schools succeed in touching thehearts of their students.''   He said other influences than the school may contribute to thedifferences, observing:   ``Unlike its public school counterpart, the Catholic high schoolis part of a larger setting in which strength is drawn from acommon moral lnaguage, a common history and a shared vision of thehuman journey.''   The study also turned up differences in family and personalbackground between students in schools run and paid for by thechurch, and students in government-run public schools, paid for bytaxes.   Catholic seniors were more likely to have grown up in largerurban communities and their parents generally have higher educationthan was the case for public school students.   Also the Catholic students had fewer nights out and fewer hoursworking on jobs during the average school week than did the publicschool students. Catholic students also were more likely to live ina two-parent home.   A special finding on a point of wide concern was that thebeliefs, values and behaviors of the current Catholic seniors areabout the same as held by their precursor classes in past years.   ``There has been a great concern about the decline in moralvalues and visions of the nation's youth during this past decade,''Guerra said, adding:   ``This study shows that, in general, recent Catholic high schoolgraduates have reported beliefs, vaules and behaviors consonantwith purposes of Catholic schools and consistent with theirpredecessors 10 years ago.''   He said ``school climate, parental involvement, teachercommitment and strong school leadership may have an even greaterimpact on formation of student values than they do on academicachievement.''   Sister Catherine T. McNamee, NCEA president, noting that theorganization's theme for this year is ``Catholic Education:Transforming Our World,'' said:   ``What more dramatic way to transform the world than to graduatestudents who bring to society the strong beliefs and valuesinstilled in them by Catholic secondary schools.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs May 18.</NOTE></DOC>
