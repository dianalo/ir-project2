Sease (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN </CO><IN> STK SCR NDX </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices fell around the world on fears of rising interest rates.    Beaten down by weeks of uncertainty, investors in Tokyo, London and New York pulled back from stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 37.80 points, closing at 1965.85 on relatively heavy volume.    Among the catalysts for the world-wide retreat: fears -- later discounted -- of coordinated interest-rate increases among the Group of Seven industrialized nations, an increase in the U.S. prime rate, and the likelihood that domestic rates will continue to move higher in the near term.    But market analysts said yesterday's interest-rate action merely touched off a response that has been building for weeks. The sell-off had its roots in the growing evidence that inflation is building, in the frightening stock-price volatility widely believed to be caused at least partly by program trading, and in the lackluster response of stock prices to strong first-quarter earnings reports. Taken together, all those factors have created an investment environment in which stocks are shunned.    &quot;It's a cumulative effect,&quot; said Abby Joseph Cohen, a portfolio strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;Basically, investors are disheartened right now.&quot;    Yesterday's retreat began in Tokyo as investors reacted to an article in The Wall Street Journal/Europe quoting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson as saying there could be an internationally coordinated boost in interest rates. But the Wall Street Journal/Europe yesterday said its article failed to note that in response to a follow-up question about the chances of coordinated rate rises in the near future, Mr. Lawson said only: &quot;What I'm saying is that we do keep very closely in touch with each other. I wouldn't go further than that.&quot;    Long before the clarification was issued, though, bond prices in Tokyo had plunged, touching off a similar decline in stock prices.    European bond markets shrugged off the Lawson comments, but the pullback in stocks spread to Europe and then to the U.S., where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 25 points in the first few minutes of trading.    Adding to investor worries here, U.S. banks, led by Chase Manhattan, began announcing increases in their prime lending rates to 9% from 8.5%, the first boost since October. Although a prime-rate increase had been expected -- based on the recent climb in the banks' own cost of borrowing -- the rises in the prime nevertheless helped keep a lid on stock prices for the remainder of the day. And economists warned that higher interest rates are likely.    Some analysts also suggested that skittish investors are seeing more evidence that the business cycle is nearing an end. &quot;Capacity utilization is rising, capital spending is increasing, inflation rates are edging upward and the Fed is responding by tightening credit,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. &quot;Those are all classic signs of an end to a business cycle. And we know what comes after a business cycle ends: a slowdown or a recession.&quot;    Market professionals said the lackadaisical performance of stock prices Tuesday -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.30 on thin volume -- after announcements by five major securities firms that they would refrain from program trading for their own accounts is evidence of just how dispirited investors have become.    &quot;The fact that it was played down so much is a very strong indication of the overwhelmingly bearish sentiment in the market,&quot; said Donald Yarling, a partner in the Chicago money-management firm of Lemley-Yarling.    Still, not everyone is abandoning stocks. James Wright, chief investment officer at Banc One Asset Management Corp. in Columbus, Ohio, said his firm was buying stocks yesterday. Mr. Wright said he thinks that the economy is weaker than most people suspect and that interest rates won't have to rise much further before the economy shows signs of slowing.    And First Albany's Mr. Johnson said that while stock prices aren't low enough to be attractive yet, it won't take much lower prices to make stocks attractive, particularly in light of expected good earnings this year.    &quot;Assuming the economy holds together, we're headed toward a level where there could be some enormous buying opportunities,&quot; he said.    Investors' resilience may soon be tested. Since February, the stock market has moved within a range of roughly 1900 to 2100 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Yesterday's move brings the average within shouting distance of the range's low end. If the average falls through this &quot;floor,&quot; some technical analysts say, further declines become much more likely. </TEXT></DOC>
