Negotiations continued yesterday between the CanadianUnion of Postal Workers, whose members have been without acontract for two years, and Canada Post. Both sides said theywere optimistic about the talks, but some major issues,including wages and the use of part-time workers to fillpositions, are unresolved.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I still think that an agreement is possible,&quot; said GillesCourville, chief negotiator for Canada Post. Union PresidentJean-Claude Parrot said the union would continue talks afterthe strike deadline in an effort to get an agreement.   Several business groups said the impact of a postal strikeis expected to be less severe this time than in past years.Timothy Reid, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce,said Canada Post has assured its business customers that itwill continue to deliver the mail even if there is a workstoppage.   The increased use of facsimile machines, computer mail,courier services and the electronic transfer of funds atbanks also will offset the impact of a strike, said AlasdairMcKichan, president of the Retail Council of Canada. Smallerbusinesses, particularly direct marketing firms, are expectedto be harder hit.   Violence erupted on picket lines at several post officesduring Canada's last postal strike, in 1987, over the use ofreplacement workers. The strike was brought to an end byback-to-work legislation.</TEXT></DOC>
