Six other officials were expelled from the party in separatecorruption cases as the ruling party tried to clean up an imagebadly tarnished by nepotism, bribe-taking and black marketeering.   The Beijing Daily said a court in the southeastern province ofGuizhou gave Tongren district party secretary Peng Jingxing thedeath sentence for selling fake maotai, a fiery sorghum liquor. Thepaper said Peng earned ``staggering profits'' of $50,800.   At least 26 people have been executed since the army cracked downon pro-democracy protesters, whose demands included an end toofficial corruption. Peng was the first party official to besentenced to death under a new anti-corruption campaign announcedafter the crackdown.   Other such campaigns in recent years have failed, partly becauseoffenders usually were disciplined by the party rather than put ontrial.   The protests that shook China from April until June gave theparty a strong incentive to try again. The student slogan that wonthe most sympathy from the public was ``Down with corruption,'' andthe posters that were most copied were those detailing examples ofnepotism among top leaders.   The party newspaper, the People's Daily, said two party memberswere expelled in Fujian province and several others were put undersupervision or criticized for arranging prostitutes for visitingbusinessmen.   In another case, it said four men who had been party members formore than 40 years were expelled in Heilongjiang province forprofiteering and bribe-taking.   There were no new reports of arrests connected with the protests.According to a count by The Associated Press, more than 2,000arrests have been reported nationwide by the official media, butChinese sources said they believed that many had been arrested inthe capital alone.   The official media blasted Western suggestions that with time,China will move away from socialism, and it lectured its citizensthat the best way to improve their lives is by raising production.   In a harsh half-page commentary, the People's Daily accused theU.S. government-run Voice of America radio of supporting theprotesters.   ``This is yet another odious demonstration of America's crudeinterference in China's internal affairs,'' it said, ``and (of) therevival of the old dream of the American anti-communist monopolycapitalist class of promoting a peaceful evolution in China'' towardcapitalism.   Such venemous criticism of the United States was common duringthe 1960s, when revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung repeatedly claimedthat Washington planned an attack, but it has not been seen in theChinese media for years.   Other political phrases from the 1960s also have reappeared. ThePeople's Daily commentary said the protests showed that classstruggle still exists in China. Other newspapers have urged studentsto learn from the workers, peasants and soldiers _ three ``good''classes.</TEXT></DOC>
