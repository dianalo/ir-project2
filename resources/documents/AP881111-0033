North because they reflected a cynical attempt by the Iran-Contradefendant to put himself above the law.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell wrote that North'sarguments for dismissing charges he lied to then-Attorney GeneralEdwin Meese III and destroyed National Security Council documents``reveals a skewed attitude toward our form of constitutionalgovernment.''   North is accused of obstructing a November 1986 presidentialinquiry into the Iran-Contra affair by lying to Meese aboutdiverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to Nicaraguan rebels.   North contends he committed no crime because Meese lacked legalauthority to question him.   ``Ours is a country governed by the rule of law,'' Gesell said inhis opinion released Thursday. ``There is nothing in theConstitution, federal statutes or applicable decisions whichwarrants this cynical approach. To merely state it provides theresponse. This court must reject it totally.''   In a separate development, the Justice Department touched off aconfrontation with independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh byobjecting to a brief he filed in North's case. It said the brief``mischaracterizes basic constitutional principles,'' but Walshissued a statement rejecting the accusation.   Gesell said North, in seeking to have the case against himdismissed, was arguing that ``he had the absolute right to lie, toobstruct such inquiries, and to remove or destroy official NSCrecords because he had not been warned that if he did so he might beindicted.''   North ``fails to appreciate the gravity of his alleged conduct,''the judge said.   ``North did in fact have fair warning that mendacity andobstruction, coupled with destruction of official documents, wasillegal,'' the judge wrote.   Defense lawyers argued that North couldn't be prosecuted forgiving false answers because he wasn't subpoenaed or placed underoath by Meese and that the attorney general's inquiry was not a``pending proceeding'' before a government agency.   ``If the allegations in the indictment are factually correct,North breached the high public duty with which he was entrusted''when questioned by Meese on Nov. 23, 1986, the judge said.   ``The court will not give judicial approval to the suggestionthat he was free in these circumstances to place his personalinterests or objections to national policy ahead of the public trusthe had accepted,'' Gesell wrote.   Walsh, the independent counsel, ``will need only to prove attrial that the specific questions posed to North by the attorneygeneral were precise and material to this legitimate presidentialinquiry'' and that North purposely lied, the judge said.   The retired Marine lieutenant colonel is charged with conspiringwith former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and armsdealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.Secord to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to theNicaraguan rebels.   Gesell also indicated he would deny similar motions to dismisscharges that North lied to Congress in 1985 and 1986 about his rolein covert aid to the Contras.   No date has been set for North's trial, the first of fourseparate trials ordered by the judge.   In its court filing critical of Walsh's Oct. 25 pleading in theNorth case, the Justice Department asked Gesell for permission to``articulate, clearly and definitively the executive's view of thelaw which governs the relationship between the president and theCongress.''   The department said it wanted to submit a friend-of-the-courtbrief because Walsh's pleading ``contains numerous statements thatare inconsistent with previously articulated statements of the lawby the Department of Justice and other Executive Branch agencies anddepartments.''   It said the prosecution brief supporting the charges againstNorth ``mischaracterizes basic constitutional principles ofseparation of powers and executive branch authority.''   A department assertion that it was not consulted by Walsh beforehe filed his brief drew a tart response from the prosecutor.   ``The independent counsel rejects the suggestion that it shouldhave solicited the views of the Department of Justice or that it hasmischaracterized the law,'' Walsh's office said in a statement.   ``While the independent counsel does not object to the submissionof legal views by the department, it strenuously opposes this whollyunjustified 11th-hour motion for an extension of time,'' thestatement said.   Justice Department officials refused to describe the specificlegal disagreements with Walsh, which they plan to outline in thepleading they want to file by Nov. 25.   The department appeared to be objecting to Walsh's statementsabout Congress' role in foreign affairs and how North and Poindexterimpaired legislative oversight by secretly financing the Nicaraguanrebels at a time when such aid was banned by the Boland Amendment.</TEXT></DOC>
