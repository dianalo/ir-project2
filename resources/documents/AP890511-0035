A CIA assessment of the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing has concludedthat Iran hired a Syrian-based Palestinian organization to carryout the operation, sources told The Post.   The sources also said the FBI is investigating the possibilitythat one of two American college students who had Arab boyfriendsmay have been the unsuspecting courier who carried the bomb ontothe flight.   The explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 270 people. Theflight had originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, and stopped inLondon before heading to New York.   The CIA is confident of its conclusions blaming Iran, but theFBI doesn't believe sufficient evidence exists to seek indictmentsagainst the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-GeneralCommand, the newspaper said.   The organization is headed by Ahmed Jibril, who with his senioraides met at least once last fall with Iranian officials in Tehran,the Post reported.   Published reports previously have linked Jibril's organizationto the bombing.   Jibril has denied that his organization planted the bomb butacknowledged in an ABC News interview broadcast last Friday thathis group routinely used the same kind of explosive device thatinvestigators say blew up the Pan Am jumbo jet.   Jibril's first lieutenant, Hafez Dalkamoni, who Jabril saidcommonly built and used the bombs, is jailed in Germany after apolice raid last October that netted weapons and three bomb deviceslike the one used to blow up Flight 103.   Jibril has denied that his group receives money from Iran buthas said he shared Iran's outrage at how the United States lastyear shot down an Iran civilian passenger plane.   ``I see now that the incident of the Pan Am is neither worse noruglier than the destruction of the Iranian airbus,'' Jibril toldABC. ``Both of them are crimes against civilians, whether by theU.S. administration or by terrorist groups who may have blown upthe Pan Am. They are equally barbaric.''   While denying his group's involvement, Jibril issued a warningshould the United States or Israel strike his camps in Syria. ``Weshall not remain still. Our response shall be equal if not moreviolent,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
