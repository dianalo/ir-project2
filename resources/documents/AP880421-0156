(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan, five weeks beforemeeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, said today that the United Statesand the Soviet Union cannot have ``a normal relationship'' unlessMoscow changes its ways and stops interfering in nations such asAfghanistan.   Reagan, in a wide-ranging speech on U.S.-Soviet ties, listed avariety of concerns for both superpowers, including arms control,the famine ravaging Ethiopia and the peace process in CentralAmerica.   On arms control, the president urged the Senate to ratify thetreaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles, signed at the lastU.S.-Soviet summit, before he and Gorbachev meet May 29 in Moscow.   He spoke hours after Senate majority Leader Robert C. Byrd saidthe Senate won't rush to ratify the treaty despite White Housepressure to do so by the summit.   The treaty is not scheduled to go to the Senate floor until May9.   Later, in a question-and-answer session with his audience at theWorld Affairs Council meeting, Reagan said that it would be ``veryupsetting and would put a strain on the summit if the Senate hasnot ratified the treaty by the time we go'' to Moscow.   ``We hope and pray that they will, but their scheduling of ithas been such that I am very concerned we may have to go withouthaving had it ratified,'' he said.   But, the president added, ``We don't want a fast treaty. We wanta good one.''   As for relations with a nation Reagan once labeled ``the evilempire,'' he said in his speech that ``the next few months will beno time for complacency, no time to sit back and congratulateourselves.''   The president said the Soviet Union can build trust only when itstops interfering in other nations and improves its record of humanrights.   ``Our policy is intended to nurture what you might call morenormal relations between East and West,'' Reagan said.   He said that a Soviet Union that tramples on the rights of itsown people ``can never have truly normal relations with the UnitedStates and the rest of the free world.   ``Neither can a Soviet Union that is always trying to push itsway into other countries ever have a normal relationship with us.''   Taking a positive note, Reagan said U.S.-Soviet relations ``havetaken a dramatic turn, into a period of realistic engagement. ...The INF treaty is now a reality and now the Senate should give itsconsent to ratification.''   He added that progress has been made on limiting strategicweapons as well.   But Reagan warned that on regional issues, such as Afghanistan,he wants to see deeds, not just words.   ``They have often promised to leave (a country,) but rarely intheir history, and then only under pressure from the West, havethey actually done it,'' Reagan said. He added that the UnitedStates believes that the Soviets ``still hope to prop up theirdiscredited, doomed puppet regime, and they still seek to pose athreat to neighboring Pakistan, to whom we have a longstandingdefense commitment.''   Reagan said it wasn't clear whether the Soviets have planned togive up such ambitions, but that ``We must make clear that anyspreading of violence on the part of the Soviets or their puppetscould undo the good'' that was promised by the Geneva pactoutlining the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.   The president reminded Gorbachev that unless he keeps hispromise to withdraw the Red Army, the United States will stand byits ``hard and fast commitment'' to support the Afghan rebels.   Reagan also demanded that the Soviets deal strongly with theirallies in Ethiopia and help food reach the hundreds of thousands ofstarving there.   ``They can stop this disaster before it happens,'' Reagan said,appealing to the Soviets to persuade the Ethiopian government toallow the international famine relief effort to continue despitethe ongoing civil war in that Northern African nation.   As for Central America, Reagan criticized both the Soviets andCongress for the situation in Nicaragua. He accused the Sovietshelped the leftist Sandinistas in ``stealing a democraticrevolution.'' Congress, he charged, had ``denied the freedomfighters the support they need'' to force the Sandinistas to keeptheir promises of democracy.   Back in Washington, Byrd, addressing the INF treaty, toldreporters:   ``We want a good treaty, that is our objective. ... ``I'm notgoing to rush to judgment.''   He said a continuing dispute over whether the new treaty banssuch futuristic weapons as those using laser rays or particle beamgenerators must be resolved before the treaty can be considered.   Byrd said he had discussed the issue of futuristic weapons withSen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, who reported verbally on the panel's findings.   He said he had asked Nunn to report more fully in writing.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze has said in aletter to Secretary of State George Shultz that the Soviets agreewith the United States that the treaty bans futuristic weapons.   On Wednesday, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said thatfailure to ratify the treaty before the summit could ``tend todampen'' prospects for progress at the summit on a long-rangemissile accord.   The White House spokesman nudged the Senate to speed up theprocess as a parliamentary commission in Moscow on Wednesdayapproved the treaty, setting the stage for Soviet ratificationbefore the summit.   To have the INF treaty signed before the summit ``would be animportant boost to our negotiations'' on strategic weapons, he said.   ``Similarly, if it's not signed, it would tend to dampen, Ithink, the prospects for serious ... progress'' on a strategicweapons treaty, Fitzwater added. ``It would not be helpful and wewould hope that the Congress would be able to ratify it before wego.''   Even if the INF treaty is ratified, administration officialsdoubt that a strategic arms agreement will be ready for signing atthe summit.   The INF treaty eliminates existing missiles with a range of 300to 3,400 miles, but some senators have questioned how the pactwould affect weapons in that range that could be developed in thefuture.   Once the treaty is on the Senate floor, the agreement likelywill encounter stalling tactics from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., andother foes.</TEXT></DOC>
