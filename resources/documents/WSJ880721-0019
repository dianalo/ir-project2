Miami-based Cordis didn't disclose terms of the settlement, but said it doesn't involve any monetary payments by either party.    Cordis, which makes medical devices, sold its pacemaker operations to a unit of Australian-based Telectronics Holdings Ltd. in April 1987. As part of that transaction, Telectronics assumed contingent liabilities related to the litigation and Cordis retained responsibility for statutory multiple damages, Cordis said.    Separately, Medtronic said it had settled all litigation with Telectronics Holdings over cardiac pacing patents. Medtronic said the settlement involved cross-licensing agreements that don't involve payments or royalties. </TEXT></DOC>
