Gen. Lev Serebrov, a political officer at the military highcommand in Kabul, told Western correspondents.   ``We came here with an honorable task, with open hearts ... Weare leaving and we have a sense of not having accomplished ourmission to the end.''   Serebrov, dressed in camouflage uniform, chain-smoking and jokingoccasionally with reporters, said Soviet officers are communicatingwith guerrilla commanders on parts of the key Salang highway, themain route to the Soviet border, to try to keep it open so thatsupplies may get through.   Under a U.N.-mediated accord signed in April, the Soviets'100,000 troops began leaving Afghanistan on May 15, and half wereout by Aug. 15. The remainder are to leave by Feb. 15.   The Soviets announced late last year they had indefinitelysuspended the withdrawal of the remaining troops because ofcontinued U.S. and Pakistani aid to the guerrillas.   Serebov disputed reports from Western diplomats in Kabul that thewithdrawal already resumed in earnest in early January.   However, Afghan troops now are manning former Soviet posts on theperimeter of this beleaguered capital, not far from guerrillapositions.   And hundreds of fully equipped Soviet troops can be seen boardinggiant Ilyushin 76 transport aircraft ferrying in and out of theairport daily.   Asked how the Soviets planned to evacuate troops by air and upthe hazardous, 250-mile Salang highway by Feb. 15 in bitter winterweather, Serebrov noted: ``That's our problem.''   Pressed about visual evidence of troops leaving, Serebrov,speaking through an interpreter, argued that the departing troopshad merely completed their two-year military service and ``are beingreplaced with new ones.''   ``We are ready ... to end the withdrawal by Feb. 15, but we havenot yet received the order to start the final stage of withdrawal,''he said.   He dodged questions about reports, including from one Sovietsource in Kabul, that the military high command will move from theAfghan capital to the town of Hairatan on the Soviet border betweenJan. 31 and Feb. 2. Asked how the commanders will go if they remainin Kabul until the deadline, he said, ``We will find a way.''   The Red Army entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to back upgovernment troops in their war with the Moslem guerrillas.   As the Soviets have left, the guerrillas have closed in on Kabul,raising fears of a bloodbath once Afghanistan's conscript army isleft alone.   ``There could be some instability ... but I don't think it willbe critical,'' Serebrov said.   Soviet officers have privately expressed serious reservationsabout the ability of the Afghan army to fight alone.   Serebrov said the Soviets, who last week began an airlift ofemergency food and fuel to Kabul, ``have to feed the whole citynow.''   Shortages are worsening in the capital, with bread queues formingin sub-freezing temperatures and roads clogged with lines of carsand buses at gasoline stations.   In Moscow, the Soviet Communist Party daily Pravda accused theresistance of buying up food supplies in the capital and spiritingthem out of the city.   It quoted Defense Minister Shakh Navaz Tanay as saying thatduring a sweep of the city in search of weapons, soldiers found``big supplies of food and goods of priority need.''   Supply roads into Kabul have been blocked periodically in Januaryby resistance attacks and by heavy snows. Pravda said supply trucksstarted getting through the snow and rebel attacks again on Jan. 19.   Serebrov acknowledged that the Soviet air force is continuingbombing raids on guerrilla positions.   But he accused the United States of repeated violations of theU.N. accord by continuing to arm the seven-group guerrilla alliancethrough neighboring Pakistan.   ``That is why the situation around Afghanistan is so tense,'' hesaid. ``This is not because of the presence of Soviet troops in thecountry.''   He paused and then compared the planned withdrawal favorably withthe U.S. pullout from Vietnam.   He told an American reporter: ``Your generals ran away fromSaigon. But we have a withdrawal that is proceeding according to atimetable.''   Serebrov's surprise meeting with the small group of Westernreporters came after a news blackout of several weeks by the Sovietcommand.</TEXT></DOC>
