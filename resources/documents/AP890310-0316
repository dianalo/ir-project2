Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and Trade RepresentativeCarla Hills met for about two hours with the Common Market's topforeign affairs official, Frans Andriessen, and its agriculturechief, Ray MacSharry.   Nico Wegter, spokesman for the 12-nation trading bloc, said thediscussions were held in a ``constructive atmosphere'' but providedno details.   The officials were having dinner together Friday night andcontinuing their talks Saturday morning. Yeutter and Mrs. Hills werescheduled to leave Brussels later Saturday.   The officials are trying to find ways to ease a conflict betweenthe United States and the community over government subsidies tofarmers before the resumption of international trade talks April 5in Geneva. The dispute has stalled the Uruguay Round negotiations,held under the auspices of the 96-nation General Agreement onTariffs and Trade.   The United States wants the Common Market to end import barriersand export and domestic farm subsidies that it says distort trade.It initially demanded the subsidies be eliminated by the year 2000.   An American proposal offered last month to the Europeans seeks togradually lower farm subsidies. A U.S. statement said the plan``does not use language strongly opposed by the (community) thatspecifically calls for elimination of trade-distorting subsidies bya certain date.''   The community has refused to agree on a date for withdrawing allsupports and wants the United States to include short-term reformmeasures in the debate.   The Common Market provides hefty subsidies to its 18 millionfarmers through guaranteed prices for many of their crops. It alsogives exporters help so costlier European farm products can competewith lower world prices.   The United States complains the export subsidies have helped thecommunity increase its share of the world market. It has respondedby setting up its own Export Enhancement Program.   A year ago, European leaders began the politically sensitive taskof curbing farm payments. They agreed to limit the maximum annualamount of expenditure on price guarantees over five years. U.S.officials say the measures were not enough to fix a fundamentallyflawed policy.   Europeans argue they cannot leave the bulk of their farmers tocompete without help in the world market. Their farms, they say, areon average smaller than in the United States and need extra aid.   The four officials held a round of get-acquainted talks inFeburary in Washington during which they agreed to set up a taskforce to try to resolve a dispute over a European ban on imports ofhormone-treated meat from the United States. The task force hasuntil early May to complete its findings.   The Common Market imposed on Jan. 1 a ban on imports of meat fromcattle treated with growth hormones. The United States refused tocomply and instead slapped stiff duties on a variety of Europeanproducts.   The Europeans have threatened to impose their own retaliatorymeasures _ tough tariffs on American walnuts and dried fruit _ ifthe conflict isn't resolved.   The hormone ban was imposed because of European concerns thestimulants pose a health risk to consumers, a claim the UnitedStates disputes.   The ban is expected to block imports of about $100 million worthof beef and beef byproducts from the United States. The tradingpartners totaled about $165 billion worth of trade in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
