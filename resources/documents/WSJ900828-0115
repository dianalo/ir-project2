If a war starts, U.S. ground troops will be dependent onthe protection of helicopters noted for performing poorly inharsh Third World weather conditions. Much of remaininghardware badly needed by U.S. forces is still weeks away fromdelivery. The Navy has too few cargo ships, and many are justtoo slow.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. military is a lumbering beast slouching towardthe Middle East. It doesn't have enough airlift capacity. Itsheavy tanks are too heavy to be moved easily; the Sheridanlight tanks, which can be airlifted, date from the 1960s.&quot;The threat remains very high,&quot; says Brig. Gen. Turki binNasser, commander of a major Saudi air base. Until additionalforces are deployed, he says, the Iraqis &quot;could go on theoffensive at any time.&quot;   No one is suggesting that Saddam Hussein or anyone elsecould overrun the U.S. military, which, in terms of totalfirepower (and especially air power) remains incomparablymore powerful. Capitalizing on aircraft carriers and agigantic aerial refueling operation, the Pentagon poured inan impressive force of more than 300 frontline jet fightersin a matter of days.   But planners for the Joint Chiefs of Staff are countingthe hours until specially built cargo ships will disgorgehundreds of tanks and other weapons to shore up U.S. groundpositions in Saudi Arabia. The monumental military buildup ofthe 1980s, in which defense spending doubled, was intended tomeet the threat of a well-known, monolithic Soviet enemy.Now, the Cold War is fading -- and much of the buildup inEurope is to be brought home.   Overall, the mighty U.S. military isn't designed forfighting in this Middle Eastern desert or in many of theother Third World hot spots where war is most likely toerupt. Along the India-Pakistan frontier, for example, wheretwo of the world's largest armies and most bitter enemies arearrayed, similar logistical problems would hamper U.S.military involvement. The same would be true if the U.S. weresuddenly dragged into a war in the politically volatiledeserts of Africa or jungles of South America.   The shortcomings of today's military are only part of theproblem. Defense experts generally agree on a wide range ofreforms that the U.S. must begin right away, but thepolitical and military bureaucracies are getting in the way.Congressional logrolling, bitter service rivalries andmassive bureaucratic inertia are the enemies of militarypreparedness, blocking reforms that are desperately needed toprepare the military for the 1990s and beyond.   &quot;The services are defending budget priorities that simplyhave been overtaken by events,&quot; says Jacques Gansler, aprominent defense analyst. Democratic Rep. Les Aspin,chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, adds that theU.S. &quot;is still shaping and sizing our forces on the Sovietthreat,&quot; blocking the transformation of the military into asmaller, more agile force with a &quot;much quicker reactiontime.&quot;   The longtime polarization of the defense-spending debatein stark left-vs.-right terms is a big part of the problem.Hawks, convinced that almost any significant Pentagon cutswill decimate U.S. readiness, continue staunchly defendingStar Wars anti-missile research, the B-2 Stealth bomber andthe breakneck modernization of the nation's nuclear arsenal-- all designed to meet a Soviet threat that is waning.Doves, meanwhile, insist on fast and deep cuts in Pentagonexpenditures, resisting the kind of difficult choicesnecessary to reshape Pentagon priorities.   The White House insists the crisis means the U.S. mustmaintain a big defense budget. &quot;I think it means just theopposite,&quot; Democratic Sen. Robert Kerrey of Nebraskacountered Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press. While the U.S. hasbeen building up for a big land war in Europe, &quot;the firstpost-Cold War crisis has occurred in the Middle East,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Our military strategy has to be evaluated.&quot;   The Mideast conflict, erasing any doubt about the kind ofchanges the military must make, is &quot;likely to establish thetype of forces that will be required for the rest of thedecade,&quot; says Gen. Edward Meyer, a retired Army chief ofstaff.   But even if the military adapts, the political structure,a labyrinth of special interests overlaid with a cumbersomecommittee structure on Capitol Hill, may not evolve soreadily. Despite Saddam Hussein's attack on Kuwait, &quot;thepolitics of cutting the defense budget have changed onlyslightly,&quot; Rep. Aspin says.   Just what kind of a force do the 1990s demand? How shouldthe U.S. shift its focus away from a powerful, monolithicenemy toward a diversity of smaller -- though highlydangerous -- threats? And, just as important, what obstaclesare blocking the path of reform? Following are some of thebroad areas in which government, industry and other defenseplanners see the need for change, and some of the factorsstanding in the way.                                                                                                          U.S. land forces must become lighter, more mobile and moreversatile.   Although the situation in Saudi Arabia might make thisseem painfully obvious, it is hardly a novel concept. One ofthe fathers of the light-forces philosophy is Robert Komer,the Pentagon's senior policy official during the Carteradministration. As a young aide to President Kennedy in the1960s, he persuaded the U.S. to lease Diego Garcia, astrategically located island in the Indian Ocean, to providea jumping-off point for U.S. forces to potential troublespots in the region. It turned out to be a godsend in thepresent crisis: The first wave of heavy armor to reach here,Marine M-60 tanks, came from that island. In crises like thepresent one, &quot;We have a military that is much larger than onewe could get somewhere within three months,&quot; says Mr. Komer.&quot;That's kind of silly.&quot;   Since the oil crisis of the early 1970s, the notion oflight forces has gotten little more than lip service. Theproblem is buried in the Pentagon's Byzantine arms-buyingbureaucracy.   Consider the saga of the 20-ton tank. Irving Wolf, amarketing official at a unit of United Industrial Corp., sayshis firm spent more than 10 years trying unsuccessfully toentice the Army into building this &quot;Rapid Deployment ForcesTank.&quot; Designed so half a dozen could be carried in a C-5transport, it would be mounted with a high-velocity, 75mmcannon developed by Pentagon researchers to penetrate Soviettank armor -- precisely the kind of weapon now needed againstIraq's tanks.   But the Army always remained cool to the idea, Mr. Wolfsays. Its officers were a &quot;little bit concerned about whetheror not a light tank would affect {funding for} the M-1 tank.&quot;   Defending the M-1 is a religion in the Army. Even thoughofficials admit that they could use a good, light tank forfast deployment, they cannot abandon their 100% commitment tothe 60-ton M-1, only one of which could be carried by a C-5to places this far away. The Army has been promotingdevelopment of a much heavier tank -- versions of which areestimated to weigh a whopping 80 tons. This proposedbehemoth, development of which has been slowed up by budgetpressures, simply couldn't fit into any airplane or travel onmost roads. It would collapse bridges even in developedcountries such as West Germany, let alone ones in the ThirdWorld.                                                                                                          Airlift and sealift capacity must be upgraded.   Historically, efforts to enhance cargo-carrying capacityhave been relegated to the back burner by gung-ho generalsand admirals, who tend to focus instead on more sexy combatequipment. Lawrence Korb, who helped oversee PresidentReagan's trillion-dollar military buildup, says civilianofficials had to force the Navy to develop the fast roll-on,roll-off ships now carrying M-1 tanks and Bradley FightingVehicles toward the Persian Gulf. &quot;The Navy didn't want tospend all the money to fix these ships so that they could beused to put Army stuff on,&quot; he says flatly. The first batchof the long-awaited heavy armor is expected to reach thefield later this week.   Spurred by the crisis in the Middle East, the Army's topbrass now appears committed to trying to solve the problem byadvocating creation of a stronger, unified &quot;TransportationCommand.&quot; It would have a big budget. It would have a lot ofclout. There's just one problem: It would dilute Air Force'sauthority to buy transport planes.   The outlook for the C-17, the Air Force's next-generationcargo plane, is also bleak, but for other reasons. Built by aMcDonnell Douglas Corp. unit, the project is beset by delays,cost overruns and nagging manufacturing problems thatthreaten to keep it mired in low-rate production for years.   Meanwhile, much of the Air Force's present cargo fleet isalmost ready for retirement, because many of the planes havebeen flying since the 1960s. The strain of moving immensequantities of weapons, food, and other supplies to SaudiArabia -- equivalent to relocating a U.S. city of about40,000 -- is beginning to show on pilots. &quot;Many of us are upto our maximum {monthly} flying hours,&quot; says Air Force Lt.Steve Jank of Lexington, Mass.   Improving ship transport, while a goal everyone supportsin the abstract, also faces problems. Defense SecretaryRichard Cheney, committed to improving nuclear defenses andbuying new aircraft, opposes such spending. &quot;Everyone givesthe issue pious approval,&quot; fumes Rep. Charles Bennett, theveteran Florida Democrat who has fought for fast sealift aschairman of an armed services subcommittee. &quot;But nobody wantsto pay for it.&quot;   The Navy, for its part, saves its clout for backing shipswith guns, not cargo ships.   Summing it up, Maj. Gen. Gus Pagonis, who is in charge ofthe unprecedented supply operation for Desert Shield, sayshis crews are &quot;doing the job with host-nation support thebest they can.&quot; But the acute shortages of cargo ships andplanes, he says flatly, &quot;have both been documented&quot; duringthe crisis.                                                                                                          As nuclear needs decrease, the Pentagon must transfer hightechnology to conventional weaponry.   Here, the situation isn't nearly so glum.   Just look at Star Wars, the high-tech venture conceived asa shield against annihilation by Soviet missiles. ThePentagon lately has been researching a proposed anti-missilesystem dubbed &quot;brilliant pebbles,&quot; a swarm of small rocketsin space that would guard against Soviet or even Third Worldmissiles.   As Iraqi troops were rushing into Kuwait, the Senatereversed years of solid, bipartisan support for Star Wars,and voted to delay brilliant pebbles for at least a decade.Little noticed at the time, though, was a move by lawmakersto beef up funding for a less ambitious anti-missile system,called the Arrow, which the U.S. and Israel are jointlydeveloping with Star Wars money. It may be an archetype forapplying outsized technology to a new array of enemies.   Researchers say the Arrow, with a speed of approximately17,000 miles an hour, is designed to intercept ballisticmissiles at such a height that their warheads -- carryingnerve gas, for instance -- would be destroyed in theexplosion or evaporated before inflicting damage on theground. It's intended to protect smaller areas than theoriginal brilliant pebbles concept. As political backing forother Star Wars projects fades, support for the Arrow, saysan Israeli official, &quot;is as safe as sun coming up tomorrow inthe Middle East.&quot;   Other more down-to-earth weapons could eventually helpU.S. forces surmount Third World conflagrations. One exampleis the FOG-M, a fiber-optic guided missile being developed byBoeing Co. and General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft unit.Classified Army reports brag that it will &quot;dominate&quot;battlefields when it is introduced, sometime in 1996.   Army officials describe the missile, light enough to belaunched from a Jeep, as exactly what the troops in SaudiArabia need right now. It is guided through a thinfiber-optic filament that, unlike the weapons they have now,allows soldiers to shoot at tanks while keeping their cover.Not everyone in the Army is so enthusiastic, however. Some ofthe service's acquisition officials, resentful of anythingthat might make tanks look bad, have insisted on deploymentof the FOG-M only as an anti-helicopter weapon.                                                                                                          Weapons must be developed and produced much faster.   All this technology transfer is meaningless without rapiddevelopment, something the military establishment has beennotoriously bad at. Take, for example, the FOG-M missile. Itwas first demonstrated in an Army laboratory in 1984, yetremains nowhere near production. The French and the Japanesehave meanwhile swiped the idea for the weapon, and are likelyto field it first. Another example is the AAWS-M, a potentlight anti-tank weapon scheduled to replace the LAW, thebazookalike missile that U.S. soldiers are carrying here.Since Vietnam, the LAW has been widely regarded asineffectual. Unfortunately, the Pentagon has just started todevelop its replacement, which won't be available for atleast a few years.   From leathernecks in the field to John Betti, the DefenseDepartment's top acquisition official, everyone agrees thatthe current average of eight or nine years to bring arelatively simple piece of hardware from the drawing board tothe combat zone is simply too long. Some major Army and Navyprograms take twice that long to become reality.   The military could field many more weapons by alsoimproving the ones it has now; with up-to-date radar,computers and missile-guidance systems, for example, currentfighters and warships could be used instead of altogether newmodels. The Air Force and Navy have started down that road,but the lure of new weapons systems continues to distractthem.   Pentagon planners proudly boast, for instance, that theAir Force F-15s and F-16s rushed into Saudi Arabia are moreagile, better maintained and more sophisticated than Iraqijet fighters, half of which are believed to be agingSoviet-built MiG-17s, MiG-21s and Su-7s. But at the sametime, senior Air Force generals have been telling Congressthat U.S. air superiority will diminish in the next decadeunless Congress preserves nearly $100 billion in spending onnew fighters and ground-attack planes.   Maneuvers such as that are used by all sides in thedefense debate -- a game, says Rep. Aspin, in which all seekto &quot;argue for their past positions.&quot; Iraq's military threat,he says, &quot;won't be decisive&quot; in shaping the Pentagon's plansfor spending next year. &quot;You don't turn around the U.S.defense establishment overnight.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
