<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-05-0492 </DOCNO><TEXT>The time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory supplemented with the regularityand single-valuedness quantization condition for the gauge invariantcomponent of the wavefunction is applied to the description of the centroidenergy and escape width of isoscalar giant quadrupole resonances in /sup16/O, /sup 40/Ca and /sup 110/Zr. Calculations are performed using theSkyrme SIII effective interaction. An important role of the finite oscillationamplitude in the mean-field dynamics is emphasized.</TEXT></DOC>
