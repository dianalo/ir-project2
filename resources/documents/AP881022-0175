Bush, the leader in polls barely two weeks before theelection, met quietly at home with a former Cuban prisoner.   Democrat Dukakis, touching on criticism of his campaign style,said, ``I may not wear my heart on my sleeve.'' But he promised to``fight my heart out for the things I believe in.''   His remarks came in a five-minute speech his campaign paid toair on ABC-TV at 10:55 p.m. EDT.   Republican Bush kept a light schedule Saturday, meeting withArmando Valladares, author of ``Against All Hope,'' a harrowingaccount of his years as a political prisoner in Cuba.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Polls are illuminating an electorate in turmoil,with voters still groping _ some of them dispiritedly _ toward adecision in the presidential election, analysts say.   While surveys indicate a healthy George Bush lead, strikingdifferences in gauging the size of the lead underline a certainunhappiness with the choices, some pollsters said in recent days.   And that means things still can change with just over two weeksto go, they said.   ``People are having lots of second thoughts,'' said AndrewKohut, president of the Gallup Organization. Even in polls thathave found stable results for weeks, he said, ``I term it stableuncertainty.''</TEXT><DATELINE>HULL, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis was at a pig farm, sitting ona bale of hay and talking about rural America while Democratic Rep.Richard Durbin stood a few feet away saying the presidentialcandidate was going about things all wrong.   With the election nearing, Dukakis' campaign message was``completely overshadowed'' by George Bush's sharply criticaltelevision commercials, Durbin said. His advice to his party'scandidate was that the uphill race could still be won, but Dukakisneeded above all to ``come out and be hard-hitting and forceful.''   Now, Durbin and other Democrats with the same message havegotten their wish.   Over the next few days, Dukakis refined his new Populistcampaign rhetoric to its essentials, waved GOP brochures in theautumn air with a denunciation that they were ``political garbage''and charged in a new television commercial that Bush's own ads were``full of lies, and he knows it.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The 100th Congress, which adjourned with aparting salvo in the war against drugs, may best be remembered forits wrestling over two national controversies _ the Iran-Contraaffair and the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.   Both dramas, played out in ornate committee rooms beforenational television audiences, involved the lawmakers in bitterfeuding among themselves and with the White House.   A host of other issues produced a lengthy list ofaccomplishments over a two-year session that brought to a close thefirst 200 years of congressional history.   For the first time since 1976, the House and Senate, workingfuriously, passed all 13 appropriations bills before the start offiscal 1989 _ an event accomplished at three minutes to midnight onSept. 30, the end of fiscal 1988.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The racketeering indictment of formerPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos signals the start of alengthy legal process that is likely to include several rounds ofplea bargaining with the Justice Department.   Even if Marcos and the government don't work out a deal thatwould spare both sides the expense of a trial, it could easily be ayear or more before Marcos would face a jury.   Federal prosecutors allege Marcos embezzled more than $100million from the Philippine government and used the money to buythree buildings in New York City. The main charge carries a maximumprison sentence of 20 years.   As part of what they promise will be a vigorous defense, Marcos'lawyers will embark on an extensive legal process of pre-trialdiscovery that is likely to involve a demand for a massive reviewof administration records for any documents suggesting Marcos wasoffered assurances he wouldn't be prosecuted if he came to thiscountry.</TEXT><DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Lebanese, with rival Moslem andChristian groups claiming to govern them, fear the monthlongturmoil over a new president will formally sever ties that kept thenation together through a 13-year civil war.   ``We have no president and Parliament is lost. What is there tohelp Lebanon survive?'' said Kazem Khalil, 88, the eldest ofLebanon's Parliamentary deputies and an architect of the country'sindependence from France in 1943.   ``This is the worst crisis we've ever had,'' said Khalil,appointed interim Parliament speaker last week. ``The political,social and economic systems have ceased to exist. We just don'tknow where we're heading.''   He echoed the despair of most Lebanese at the creeping partitionof the country into Moslem and Christian cantons after Parliamentfailed to elect a president to succeed Amin Gemayel when hissix-year term expired Sept. 23.</TEXT><DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Shiite Moslem leader said Saturday thatkidnappers holding foreign hostages and threatening to hurt theAmerican ones were committing an ``unforgivable crime.''   Nabih Berri, who heads the mainstream Shiite Amal militia, spokein an interview with The Associated Press after the Islamic Jihad,a pro-Iranian fundamentalist faction, warned it would punishAmerican hostages it is holding.   The Islamic Jihad threat was in retaliation for Friday's Israeliair raid on Lebanon that killed 16 people and injured 34. Israeliplanes also flew over the pro-Iranian extremist stronghold ofBaalbek in east Lebanon today, police said, but no attacks werereported.   Berri's Syrian-backed militia has been locked in a fiercestruggle with pro-Iranian fundamentalists for mastery of the Shiitecommunity. It has no influence on the kidnappers.</TEXT><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rep. Pat Swindall is attempting to beat anElection Day deadline with his one-man, rush-to-justice defense ina federal perjury trial that will climax one of the country's mostbitter congressional elections.   If everything goes as expected, the two-term Republicancongressman will deliver his opening argument in U.S. DistrictCourt on Monday, just one week after his indictment was handed upand just 15 days before the Nov. 8 election.   Swindall, a lawyer, is representing himself in the perjury caseand hopes a quick acquittal will bring victory at the polls.   He has admitted to a mistake in judgment in negotiating an$850,000 loan last year with an undercover agent posing as afinancier, but denies criminal wrongdoing. Eventually, Swindallaccepted a $150,000 check from a middleman, then returned ituncashed.</TEXT><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israel's election is focused on whether to keepthe West Bank and Gaza Strip as a buffer to hostile Arab states ortrade away the land to preserve the Jewish character of Israel.   Israelis seem almost evenly split on the issue, and the Nov. 1vote may be less a watershed than another shotgun wedding betweenthe rightist Likud bloc of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and theleft-leaning Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.   Shamir and Peres have been reluctantly sharing power since the1984 elections resulted in a stalemate. The unlikely coalition hashung together despite basic policy differences.   Interest is high in this year's election and about 80 percent ofthe 2.4 million eligible voters are expected to cast ballots.</TEXT><DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Residents of Reykjavik are getting onelast chance to stop the capital from going to the dogs.   This week, they vote on an experimental program relaxing a banon dogs in the city of 88,000. The weeklong referendum beginsMonday and asks voters to say whether the 4-year-old program hasbeen a success.   City Hall banished dogs in 1924 following an outbreak ofdog-related disease. For 60 years it resisted attempts to overturnthe ban, despite ridicule from abroad and lurid stories about massslaughter of illicit dogs.   In 1978, dog owners went to the Supreme Court in an unsuccessfulbid to have the ban declared unconstitutional. The issue madeheadlines again when Albert Gudmundsson, then the finance minister,threatened to emigrate unless he could keep his dog in Reykjavik.</TEXT><DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In dealing a blow to an ambitiousSerbian politician, Yugoslavia's Communist leaders have shown howdifficult it is to quell ethnic turmoil or introduce democracy inthis one-party state.   With millions watching on television, the Communist elite lastweek ended 38 hours of bitter debate with a dramatic rebuff toSerbian Communist party leader Slobodan Milosevic.   A close ally of Milosevic, Dusan Ckrebic, was the only member ofthe ruling Politburo not to win a secret vote of confidenceWednesday from the party's policy-setting Central Committee.   Ckrebic, an old-time Communist in his 60s, immediately offeredhis resignation. But Milosevic angrily intervened to stopconsideration of the offer, and Ckrebic remains on the Politburofor now.</TEXT></DOC>
