The proposal, which NASD Chairman Gordon Macklin sent to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman John Shad, comes as legislators and regulators in Washington have been considering enforcing a one-share, one-vote standard across U.S. stock markets.    The NASD's proposal was well-received in Washington. &quot;It's a very constructive development,&quot; said Mr. Shad. &quot;This is wonderful,&quot; added SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest. &quot;It's an exercise in enlightened self-interest.&quot;    The voting rights issue came to a head last year when the New York Stock Exchange said it would abandon its one-share, one-vote rule after some of its listed corporations, including General Motors Corp. and Dow Jones andamp; Co., which publishes this newspaper, created classes of stock with unequal voting rights. Under present Big Board rules, these companies would be forced to list their shares elsewhere.    Big Board officials have testified before the SEC they wanted to retain the one-share, one-vote rule, but would only do so if other markets, including the American Stock Exchange and the NASD, also adopted the rule. The Amex endorsed the proposal, but the NASD, which regulates the over-the-counter market, didn't.    The SEC's favorable reaction indicates that the commission is strongly inclined to approve a uniform one-share, one-vote standard, with significant exemptions. The agency's market regulation staff is already working on a proposal that basically takes the same approach as the NASD's plan, according to SEC officials.    &quot;Now the issue is, can we and the markets come up with a common standard that we all can agree on?&quot; said Mr. Grundfest.    Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, also commended the NASD's proposal. &quot;I'm pleased the NASD has seen the light and has joined the other major exchanges in advocating a uniform standard that guarantees every shareholder a voice in the governance of corporate America,&quot; he said.    The reaction on Wall Street, however, was somewhat cooler. Kenneth R. Leibler, president of the Amex, said: &quot;In concept, certainly it's nice to see the NASD agree to a joint rule, which is something they haven't done before.&quot; Still, Mr. Leibler said the exemptions proposed by the NASD seemed to be &quot;so wide I'm not sure the rule has real bite.&quot;    A spokeswoman for the Big Board said its officials haven't seen the NASD proposal and couldn't comment.    Under the NASD proposal, companies that already have dual classes of stock would be protected under a &quot;grandfather&quot; clause. In addition, companies would be allowed to issue new shares with limited or no voting rights in cases where all relevant details &quot;are clearly spelled out to prospective investors in a prospectus.&quot; The creation of such new classes of stock also would be allowed to facilitate a merger, acquisition or recapitalization, as long as &quot;the exchange of shares is accompanied by detailed proxy material.&quot;    Mr. Macklin said the exemptions only cover cases where corporations create new classes of stock with less voting power than existing shares. The creation of so-called &quot;super&quot; voting rights, where companies give certain shareholders more voting rights than fellow holders, wouldn't be permitted under the NASD plan. Also, in cases where two voting classes of stock are created, corporations wouldn't be allowed to declare the shares with superior voting rights unsaleable. Such a tactic has been used in recent years to protect management from a hostile takeover.    Most of the listed corporations in the U.S. observe one-share, one-vote. Mr. Leibler said &quot;the vast majority&quot; of the Amex's approximately 900 listed companies have equal voting rights for all holders. Mr. Macklin said in his letter to the SEC that about 95% of the approximately 2,700 companies in the NASD's National Market System observe one-share, one-vote. </TEXT></DOC>
