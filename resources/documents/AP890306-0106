It was the latest blow against officials accused of corruption inthe republic, which has been the focus of sensational articles inthe Soviet press.   The Uzbek Supreme Soviet, meeting in the capital of Tashkent inan emergency session, relieved Pulat Khabibullaev from his duties aschairman of the parliament's executive body, the presidium, theofficial news agency said.   Khabibullaev had been in his post for less than a year butrecently new information was revealed about previous jobs he held,Tass said.   ``When occupying executive posts at the republican Academy ofSciences,'' Tass said, ``Khabibullaev promoted by illegal means thecareers of relatives of the former republican party and governmentleaders who have compromised themselves.''   The dispatch did not say whether Khabibullaev faces criminalcharges.   The news agency listed the former leaders with ties toKhabibullaev as Sharaf Rashidov, Inamzhon Usmankhodzhaev andNormakhamandi Khudaiberdyev.   Rashidov, Uzbek party chief for 22 years, died in 1983 and hasbeen criticized harshly for allowing rampant corruption.Usmankhodzhaev succeeded Rashidov and carried out an extensiveanti-corruption campaign but was retired ostensibly for healthreasons in January 1988.   No identification was available for Kudaiberdyev.   At Monday's Supreme Soviet meeting, deputies chose as therepublic's new president Mirzaolim Ibragimov, a 61-year-old teacherwho represented Uzbekistan at the Council of Ministers in Moscow.   The Soviet press has published many articles on a colossalembezzlement and bribery scheme centered in Uzbekistan and involvingthe republic's cotton industry. It reached all the way to theKremlin's first family. In December, after a four-month trial,former President Leonid I. Brezhnev's son-in-law Yuri Churbanov wassentenced to 12 years in a labor camp for taking about $145,000 inbribes. He was accused of taking the bribes while one of thecountry's top law enforcers.</TEXT></DOC>
