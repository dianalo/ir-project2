Rev. Lett. 55, 939 (1985); Phys.Fluids 29, 2781 (1986)]. The radial profile of microwave power depositionis directly measured without the influence of wall reflection. It coincideswith that of the axial flow of warm electrons driven by the fundamentalheating as well as with that of the plasma potential at the resonance.This indicates that strong electron cyclotron heating largely affectsthe potential formation through driving an axial flow of warm electrons.</TEXT></DOC>
