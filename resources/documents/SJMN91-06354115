But the prospect of usinguniversity funds as front money to buy the lavish home, amid this most Spartanof all budget years, may ruffle some non-presidential feathers.;   &quot;A numberof people are concerned about that,&quot; said J. Handel Evans, the interimuniversity president.;   The San Jose State University Foundation, whichmanages all non-state funds for the campus, last week made an offer on thehome, at 875 Chapman St., contingent upon its full board approving the dealtoday.;   With an initial asking price of $1,095,000, the two-story,54-year-old stucco home &quot;speaks of quality and dignity,&quot; according to itsdescription in a real estate listing service. Other amenities: a pool with hottub, a Jacuzzi, marble and hardwood floors.;   Five other California StateUniversity campuses, Fresno, Chico, Pomona, San Luis Obispo and Fullerton,have homes for their presidents. San Jose State is among 15 that don't.;  Evans says that the university desperately needs a presidential home, and thatthis is a good time to get one to lure a new president.;   Fullertonsuccessor;   A committee is searching for the permanent successor to retiredPresident Gail Fullerton. She lived in Santa Cruz during most of her 13-yeartenure. Her predecessor, John Bunzel, lived in Belmont.;   Without auniversity home for its next president, &quot;we very well could lose some primecandidates,&quot; said Alan Simpkins, a retired electronics executive and prominentalumnus who is among those supporters of the Rose Garden purchase.;   Inaddition, the home would be the place where a president could entertainprospective university donors as well as community dignitaries.;   &quot;We have toimprove our development and use the presidency for that purpose,&quot; said Evans,who as acting president earns $115,956 a year and receives a $1,000-per-monthhousing allowance.;   Lean times;   But these are lean times for the stateuniversity system.;   So bleak is San Jose State's budget this year that ithopes to raise about $300,000 just to bring the athletic program back into theblack, said Evans.;   And though many of San Jose State's buildings are badlyin need of repair, the university can't afford to do most of the work.;   It'squestionable that the university will promptly raise the funds to buy the homeand not leave the foundation with the tab.;   &quot;This is a very, very bad timein the valley,&quot; said Evans. &quot;And the money is very difficult go get.&quot;;  Breaking a cardinal rule;   Even in good times, the proposal would break oneof the cardinal rules of fund-raising: Raise the money first. &quot;It is myexperience in fund-raising that to raise money for something you already haveis incredibly difficult,&quot; said Evans.;   &quot;It's a wonderful house,&quot; he added.&quot;But I don't think the foundation is in the position to put a million dollars,or whatever it costs us, on the table.&quot;;   Although it has its own board ofdirectors, which includes alumni, faculty, staff and community members, it islocated on campus and headed by Evans.;   To buy the home, the foundationwould tap funds primarily donated by federal agencies and foundations tosponsor research projects on campus.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TOM PHILP, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911219  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  618  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, December 19, 199100354115,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
