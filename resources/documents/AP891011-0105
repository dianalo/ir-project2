STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East Germany's Communist ideology chief was quotedtoday as calling for a more democratic society, but the officialparty newspaper said the country can solve its problems only bystrengthening socialism.   The developments were the latest in a series of mixed signalsthe hard-line government has been sending the rest of the world asit grapples with a growing movement for social change.   Kurt Hager, one of the most influential figures in the CommunistParty hierarchy, called for greater participation of the people insolving the country's problems, more openness in society and reformof the state-controlled press.   Hager, a member of the policy-making party Politburo, made thecomments in an interview with the Soviet weekly Moscow News onSaturday, as street protests erupted in several cities during thevisit of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   State-run Radio DDR read the comments in a broadcast today.   ``Our task in the immediate future is to come up with a clearconcept for the development of necessary changes,'' Hager said.``That will require, above all, the active involvement of thepopulation in solving important problems and a new policy of publicinformation.''   Referring to the exodus of mostly young people from the country,Hager said that ``all of the obstacles have to be cleared away thathave apparently prevented our youth from developing their fullpotential.''   Hager also also called for the government to react to the``needs and mood'' of the people.   The party daily Neues Deutschland today conceded the country hasproblems, but at the same time said socialism must be strengthenedto solve them.   The newspaper also renewed its accusations against West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl, accusing him of ``unveiled interference in(East Germany's internal affairs.'' Kohl has been extremelycritical of the East German government in recent days.   ``If today we stand before new demands that require newsolutions, we'll manage that ourselves,'' the newspaper said.   ``We can solve our own problems, not through Kohl's recipes, butthrough socialist means ... through the further strengthening ofsocialism. Every demand and recommendation that in reality aims atweakening or even doing away with socialism cannot bear fruit amongus,'' the newspaper wrote.   Local Communist Party officials in at least three East Germancities _ Dresden, Leipzig and Magdeburg _ have either started talkswith pro-democracy activists or talks are planned, according toWest German news media reports.   But questions remain whether high-ranking leaders in East Berlinare ready to move away from the strict adherence to Communism thathas helped sparked an exodus to West Germany of tens of thousandsof its skilled young citizens.   Guenter Krusche, head of the church in East Berlin, told WestGerman radio today there are indications a number of East Germancities will soon legalize the main opposition group, New Forum,according to West German radio.   On Tuesday, West German news media reports said local Communistofficials had met with opposition leaders in Dresden and talks wereexpected soon in Leipzig.   Westdeutscher Rundfunk radio in Cologne said today thatMagdeburg party leaders ``have also said they are ready for adialogue.''   However, Erich Honecker, the country's 77-year-old Communistleader, has indicated he will crush dissent if it challengesstability.   Over the weekend, authorities used force to dispersedemonstrators, clubbing and arresting hundreds. Then officials inLeipzig allowed a peaceful march by 70,000 people Monday night.   Local Communist officials met Monday with opposition leaders inDresden and talks were said to be expected in Leipzig, the firstsigns of official willingness to discuss change.   Christof Ziemer, the superintendent of Dresden's Lutheranchurch, said the two sides discussed electoral reform, endingtravel restrictions and the release of people arrested duringstreet demonstrations.   The nationwide protests by tens of thousands of people were EastGermany's most serious since Soviet tanks helped put down aworkers' revolt in 1953.   Pro-democracy activists said authorities freed at least 500 ofthe roughly 1,000 people arrested during demonstrations in Dresdenover the past week.   Widespread discontent is responsible for the exodus of tens ofthousands of East Germans to the West and sparked the weekenddemonstrations, which coincided with official celebrations of thecountry's 40th anniversary.   Hans-Juergen Sievers, a Lutheran church pastor in Leipzig, saidTuesday in a West German radio interview that he believed thedecision by the Leipzig officials to work for dialogue ``wascertainly not made alone without discussions with others.''   East Germans do not choose their leaders and they needgovernment permission to travel abroad. Many complain of tyrannicalCommunist officials who can make life miserable for people whochallenge the system.</TEXT></DOC>
