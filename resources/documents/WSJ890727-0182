Laundry-pile neuroses and dust-ball anxiety are ailments women need to cure themselves of -- not spread to others. We have learned three-level market forecasting and sophisticated business strategies, but we have not yet replaced ourselves at the helm of home and family life. Performing that &quot;second shift&quot; poses a serious threat to women's physical and emotional health. The question of who will care for the family is such a serious one that many bright young career women and their husbands are deciding to forgo having children -- a decision that represents a loss to all of us.    Creating a warm and wonderful home environment is an important and time-consuming job. But who will give the necessary time and energy to the home is a key issue for this and future generations.    Any working mother certainly could have told the authors of &quot;The Second Shift&quot; that women give up leisure time to do housework, and men don't. A more important question than how to get men to do more is how to help women to do less, how to prevent them from curtailing almost all recreational time in favor of the necessary &quot;second shift&quot; for housework.    I suggest that a good part of the answer lies in hiring paid home workers. Almost all budgets can accommodate some type of household help, even if it is part time. It would be nice if each of us had a wife at home to anticipate and meet our needs, self-directed, self-motivated and unsalaried. But that is not possible for working mothers.    As I close this letter, I am snatching still-damp laundry from the dryer. Our home helper is on vacation, my son ran out of clean T-shirts for day camp, and I'm going to be late for work.
