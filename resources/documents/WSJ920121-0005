The proposed stock sale comes nearly five years after theGreensboro, N.C., textile company went private in a leveragedbuy-out led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. It would be one of thelargest initial public offerings in the past three years.</LP><TEXT>   As proposed, Burlington plans to sell 57 million newshares to the public at a price within a range of $14 to $16each. That would put 83% of the company's stock in publichands, an unusually high percentage for an initial publicoffering.   For Burlington, a successful IPO would complete aremarkable return to financial health in the past 12 months.A year ago, Burlington was posting large losses, andinvestors had marked down the prices of its junk bonds toless than half of face value on the belief that the companymight not be able to pay its debts.   In the past year, however, Burlington has narrowed itslosses significantly. &quot;Cost-cutting has helped, and so has adrop in the price of wool and cotton,&quot; two important rawmaterials, says Richard Byrne, an analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp;Co. &quot;But what's really been the savior for the company hasbeen an upturn in the denim market, especially overseas.&quot;Burlington is a major maker of denim.   For the year ended Sept. 30, Burlington reported a lossfrom continuing operations of $69.6 million on revenue of$1.93 billion, about half the loss of a year earlier.Earnings before interest and taxes totaled $156.8 million,but were swamped by Burlington's $251.7 million interestbill.   In documents for its stock offering filed with theSecurities and Exchange Commission, Burlington indicated thatits financial picture will brighten once its stock sale iscompleted and the proceeds used to reduce debt.   If the stock sale had been completed last year and itsdebt reduced accordingly, the company said, its interest billwould have shrunk to $112.7 million for fiscal 1991. Netincome from continuing operations would have totaled $30.8million, or 45 cents a share.   Burlington said it plans to use proceeds from the stocksale, along with a new $1.25 billion bank loan, to retire orrefinance all its outstanding junk-bond debt. Burlington saidit will make tender offers for $535.5 million of publiclytraded high-yield junk bonds, including its 13 7/8% bonds due1996, its 14 1/4% bonds due 1999 and two classes ofzero-coupon bonds. It didn't specify the prices it will offerbondholders.   Prices of Burlington's junk bonds jumped on the news. Thecompany's 13 7/8% bonds, which had been quoted at about $1.02on the dollar last week, rose to about $1.06 yesterday.   Burlington said it also will repurchase $323.7 million ofdebt held by Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., abig insurer. Burlington also said it will refinance all itsexisting bank debt.   For Burlington's major owners, successful completion ofthe public offering would triple the value of stock theyacquired at the time of the 1987 buy-out. Current investorsin the company, including Morgan Stanley Group Inc., BankersTrust New York Corp. and Equitable, aren't selling any oftheir shares.   Burlington said that once it becomes a public company andrecruits new independent directors, the two Morgan Stanleyrepresentatives on its board, Donald Brennan and AlanGoldberg, will resign. Morgan Stanley has profitedconsiderably from its five-year association with Burlington,collecting more than $170 million in investment-banking feesand dividends from working with the textile company.   The public offering will confirm a markdown in the valueof two million Burlington shares owned by the company'semployee stock ownership plan. In 1989, the employee planbegan acquiring stock valued at a split -- adjusted $25.20 ashare -- significantly above the price at which Burlingtonplans to go public.   &quot;At least the ESOP's stock is worth something now,&quot; saidMerrill Lynch's Mr. Byrne. &quot;There was a time that it didn'tseem to be worth anything.&quot; A Burlington spokesman added thatshares in the ESOP will be vested more quickly as a result ofthe public offering, indirectly benefiting Burlingtonemployees.</TEXT></DOC>
