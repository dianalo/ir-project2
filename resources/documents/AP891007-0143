ManuelAntonio Noriega last week does not foretell U.S. policy.   He said there will be a time for ``an effective way to getGeneral Noriega out'' and gave 8-to-5 odds that will happen withinsix months.   At the same time, however, he indicated in a CNN ``Evans andNovak'' television interview that the United States wanted thePanama Defense Force coup leaders to turn over Noriega to U.S.hands without any aggressive action by the United States.   A news report said the United States decided to ask the coupleaders for just that action, but the decision came too late.   The Washington Post reported in its Sunday editions thecommander of U.S. forces in Panama was authorized to covertly takeNoriega to an American military base during last week's coupattempt. But the authorization came just as the attempted coupcollapsed Tuesday afternoon, the Post quoted administration andcongressional sources as saying.   The sources told the Post Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of theJoint Chiefs of Staff, relayed the authorization from DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney to Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, head of U.S.forces in Panama.   Thurman was told any mission would have to be carried outwithout visible display of U.S. forces, but military personnelcould act undercover, the Post reported. Powell told Thurman hecould have the rebels deliver Noriega to a U.S. base.   Powell also told Thurman to avoid the possibility of armedconflict with pro- and anti-Noriega forces, according to the Post.He was also ordered to develop a plan to capture Noriega with armedforces and take him to an American base, but was told the planwould have to be approved by President Bush before action could betaken.   A Pentagon spokesman said late Saturday he could not confirm thereport.   Sununu, asked Saturday what it would have taken to get Bush touse military force in the coup, said: ``The easiest thing thatcould have happened is if the PDF forces brought Mister Noriega toterritory that is under the treaty, under the control of the UnitedStates and we could enforce the indictment'' against Noriega fordrug trafficking charges.   Asked whether he meant the administration was unwilling to takeany aggressive action, Sununu replied, ``You're talking about aninvasion of Panama,'' and said the `ideal thing'' is for thePanamanians to undertake the ouster.   Congressional criticism of Bush's actions, meanwhile, continuedSaturday, with Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the SenateIntelligence committee, stating that the White House erred in nothaving the CIA represented at two key decision-making meetings onPanama on Monday and Tuesday.   Criticism has come from both Democrats and Republicans, whoaccuse the White House of bungling its way through the crisis andhelping doom the coup.   Boren said he was also bothered that because, ``I'm not certainthat the president was ever really well served or presented withthe kind of decision options that should have been presented to him.   He said he could find no evidence that Bush was told the Noriegaloyalists were travelling to the PDF headquarters via routes otherthan those blocked by U.S. troops. He complained Bush was neverasked, ``Mister President, will you give us authority to useAmerican troops to block those routes, to keep those reinforcementsfrom being able to come in and quash the coup?''   Meanwhile, a Newsweek magazine poll released Saturday said 60percent of the 750 adults polled Thursday and Friday said it was``very important'' to get Noriega out of power and 45 percentbelieve the United States lent the right amount of support to thecoup attempt. Nine percent said they thought the United States didtoo much and 30 percent not enough.   Pressed during the CNN interview for his prediction on whetherNoriega would still be in power after six months, Sununu said, ``Wecertainly would like to see him out. The president has said hewants him out, and I can't believe that between the will of thepeople of Panama, and the will of the people of the United States,we can't achieve that. ... If you want odds, I'd say eight-to-fivethat he probably will be out.''   As to why Panamanians should think the United States would backany future coup efforts with U.S. troops, he said the aborted couplast week proves there is unrest in the PDF, ``And I would not besurprised if the PDF understands that when the president says ourquarrel is not with the PDF but with General Noriega that therewill be continued unrest in that and an opportunity will come alongin an effective way to get General Noriega out.''   Continuing an administration effort to counter criticism thatthe United States should have sent its troops to back up the coup,Sununu said there was no communication from the coup leaders insideNoriega's headquarters until they were ``about to be overwhelmed''by Noriega's defenders.   And, countering congressional allegations that the United Stateswas given a chance to retrieve Noriega, he said, ``There was noindication whatsoever whether General Noriega was in there'' intime for Bush to make a decision on intervening.   Then, he said, the rebels ``made it clear they did not want togive General Noriega to the United States'' for trial, and ``rightafter that, the superior forces'' of Noriega regained power.   He also disputed a report that he now wants to alter theadministration's decision-making operation to have the NationalSecurity Council take charge in such crises. The chief of staffsaid it was ``appropriate'' during the Panama situation that thechain of command came through the Pentagon, via Southern Commandheadquarters in Panama, to Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney andthen to the White House.</TEXT></DOC>
