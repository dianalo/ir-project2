<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-28-0898 </DOCNO><TEXT>The substitutional reactivity of the mixed-metal clusters FeRu{sub 2}(CO){sub12} and Fe{sub 2}Ru(CO){sub 12} has been investigated as a comparisonto Fe{sub 3}(CO){sub 12} and Ru{sub 3}(CO){sub 12}. The reactions arefirst order in cluster with only a very small dependence of the enteringligand (L = PPh{sub 3} or P(OMe){sub 3}), consistent with a dissociativeinterchange mechanism. The activation parameters and all other data areconsistent with CO dissociation as the rate-determining step. FeRu{sub2}(CO){sub 12} undergoes substitution to FeRu{sub 2}(CO){sub 10}L{sub2} (both ligands substituted on ruthenium) with no evidence for a monosubstitutedcluster. Substitution on Fe{sub 2}Ru(CO){sub 12} leads initially to Fe{sub2}Ru(CO){sub 11}L (substitution on ruthenium) and subsequently to Fe{sub2}Ru(CO){sub 10}L{sub 2} (substitution on iron and ruthenium). CO dissociationfrom Fe{sub 2}Ru(CO){sub 12} and ReFu{sub 2}(CO){sub 12} occurs morerapidly than from Fe{sub 3}(CO){sub 12} or from Ru{sub 3}(CO){sub 12},suggesting a metal center effect on CO dissociation.</TEXT></DOC>
