The time has come for local and state authorities to . . . prosecute polluters and employers who put their workers at risk.&quot; As the officials responsible for enforcing federal environmental laws, we offer the following facts:    In fiscal 1986 the EPA initiated a record 386 civil enforcement cases in federal district court, compared with the old high of 323 the year before. In the same year, the EPA issued 2,607 administrative orders against violators.    In addition to this aggressive use of civil and administrative tools, we have used our criminal enforcement authorities. Since 1983, 249 defendants have been charged with criminal environmental conduct and 207 have either pleaded guilty or been convicted. Of these, approximately 70% have been individuals, and roughly 85% of those have been corporate directors, presidents, vice presidents, managers or owner-operators. In 1986 alone, prison sentences imposed by federal judges totaled 124 years, of which more than 31 years will be served. In addition, more than $1.9 million in fines were levied in fiscal 1986, with fines amounting to more than $5 million since the program began in 1983.    We agree that the federal and state governments should work closely with one another in environmental enforcement, and they do. We have agreements with the states on how enforcement work is to be shared. Last year states brought 4,877 administrative enforcement actions under the air, water, hazardous-waste and pesticides laws, up 22.5% from the year before.    Through such organizations as the National Association of Attorneys General, the National Environmental Enforcement Council, Northeast Hazardous Waste Project and State/EPA Committees, the federal government and the states are able to share data, integrate the use of enforcement resources and conduct joint investigations/prosecutions. By means of such organizations, the EPA supports local prosecutors.    We reject the proposition that environmental enforcement is at a &quot;crisis level.&quot; Working closely with the states, we have built an enforcement program that is making substantial and unprecedented contributions to environmental protection.
