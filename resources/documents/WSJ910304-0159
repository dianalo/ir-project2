Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf said yesterday that Iraq acceptedthe allies' terms for establishing a permanent cease-fire,during a meeting that he called &quot;a major step forward in thecause of peace.&quot; Later in the day, Baghdad Radio announcedthat Iraq has accepted a new United Nations resolutionimposing other terms on Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   Gen. Schwarzkopf, the allied commander, said that once acease-fire agreement is signed, &quot;all coalition forces will bedrawn back from Iraqi territory that we currently occupy.&quot;   The seven Iraqi generals attending yesterday's two-hoursession at an allied-occupied Iraqi air base three milesnorth of Kuwait agreed to the immediate release of prisoners,to providing information about the location of land and seamines, and to &quot;control measures&quot; that Gen. Schwarzkopf saidwould prevent accidental clashes between the two sides. Therealso was agreement to exchange information on troops missingin action, including a U.S. request for names of those whomight have died in Iraq's custody.   Meanwhile, the Bush administration prepared for a round ofconsultations with coalition partners on Mideast peace. Atthe same time, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft gavethe strongest indication yet that, in the glow of victory,the White House is considering scaling back its long-termplans to reduce the armed forces by about 25% by 1997.   When the commanders of the vanquished Iraqi forces arrivedfor yesterday's talks, they were greeted by more than 50M1-A1 tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles lining the airfield's runway and armed Apache attack helicopters roaringoverhead. Outside the tent where the meeting was held, a signsaid, &quot;Welcome to Iraq, courtesy The Big Red One,&quot; areference to the First Infantry Division, which patrols thispart of Iraq.   &quot;This isn't a negotiation,&quot; Gen. Schwarzkopf toldreporters before the session. &quot;I'm here to tell them exactlywhat we expect of them.&quot;   Later, at a news conference, the coalition commander saidthat &quot;the Iraqis came to discuss and to cooperate with apositive attitude.&quot; He characterized the agreement concerningprisoners of war as &quot;the most important point we discussed,&quot;and expressed confidence that there would be a &quot;symbolicrelease immediately&quot; as a show of good faith. The generaldidn't elaborate, and the Pentagon didn't provide furtherdetails of the agreement yesterday.   The latest U.N. resolution, passed by the Security Councilon Saturday and accepted by Iraq yesterday, reaffirmed thatIraq must comply with 12 earlier U.N. measures. The newresolution also includes specific demands that Baghdad agreein principle to its liability for the damage arising from itsinvasion of Kuwait and to rescind its annexation of Kuwait.The resolution also indicates that an earlier measureauthorizing the use of force against Iraq remains in forceuntil there is agreement on peace terms.   On NBC News's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; yesterday, Secretary ofState James Baker suggested that &quot;the degree to which thecoalition and other countries would actively prosecute theirclaims&quot; for reparations against Iraq could depend on whetherSaddam Hussein remains in power. Responding to reports ofanti-Saddam Hussein protests in Iraq and that the Iraqidictator might be seeking asylum, Mr. Baker said that theU.S. didn't know if Saddam Hussein's power was beingseriously challenged.   With the war all but ended, the Bush administration isshifting its attention toward Middle East diplomacy. Mr. Bushsuggested Friday that he would move quickly on Mideastpeacemaking. But with a thicket of problems awaiting it, theadministration isn't likely to show the same boldness itexhibited in war.   Mr. Baker, who travels to the region later this week,underscored that &quot;we're not going with a specific plan.&quot; Hesaid that the U.S. can be &quot;effective as a catalyst,&quot; but that&quot;it would be a mistake for us to expect that in the aftermathof this conflict, all of a sudden were going to haveimmediate peace, {an} immediate solution to the Arab-Israeliproblem.&quot;   Mr. Baker did signal a subtle change in the U.S. approachto the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. The administration hadearlier emphasized starting talks between Israelis andPalestinians. Now, the administration is shifting the focusto a two-track plan, which would include such talks butemphasize talks between Israel and the Arab states.   Mr. Baker and other officials realize that support forSaddam Hussein during the war by Yasser Arafat, leader of thePalestine Liberation Organization, deeply angered Mr.Arafat's former Arab supporters. Mr. Arafat was &quot;seriouslyand substantially&quot; hurt by his decision to back Iraq, Mr.Baker said. But with Mr. Arafat likely to remain as head ofthe PLO, the administration may be back to square one -- asearch for Palestinians who would sit at the table withIsrael.   In the past, Jordan's King Hussein tried to provide abridge between the Palestinians and Israelis, but his supportof Saddam Hussein angered both the Arabs in the coalition andthe U.S. &quot;That country is in a very difficult situation,&quot; Mr.Scowcroft said yesterday. But Mr. Baker appeared to offer anolive branch, saying that King Hussein was under severepressure from his majority Palestinian population, which isstaunchly pro-Iraq. As the U.S. searches for Mideast peace,Mr. Baker said, King Hussein &quot;may become a very importantplayer in this.&quot;   The U.S. may have other problems in the postwar period.The gruesome pictures of the slaughter of Iraqi troopsretreating from Kuwait and the allied onslaught in theclosing hours of the war are likely to exacerbate anger amongradical and anti-Western Arabs, who will use them to agitateagainst cooperation with the U.S.   The threat of terrorist attacks also remains serious,despite Mr. Baker's acknowledgement yesterday that Syria, amember of the coalition, and Iran used their influence torein in terrorist groups they control from attacking Westerninterests during the war. However, U.S. counter-terrorismspecialists point out that American intelligence agenciesnever saw the terror bands most closely linked to Syria andIran as the main threat of Gulf War terrorism. The groupsthat the U.S. most feared are sponsored by Iraq.   &quot;We're not saying, even privately, that the terrorismthreat is over,&quot; said a top administration expert on Mideastterrorism.   Indeed, the administration has begun to make a caseoverall that it won't let its military guard down.Capitalizing on the stunning battlefield success and anoutpouring of popular support for the Pentagon, the WhiteHouse appears to be rethinking both the speed and size ofdefense cutbacks it previously agreed to make.   On ABC News's &quot;This Week with David Brinkley&quot; yesterday,National Security Adviser Scowcroft asserted that if the cutsproposed for the next two years had been in place, the U.S.may have been unable to deploy such an overwhelming force inthe Gulf.   &quot;We ought to take a new look at the projections of ourdefense budget . . . and the {reduction of} forces to seewhether or not they are exactly what we want,&quot; he said.   Pentagon officials said they hadn't received specificorders to redraw spending plans or submit new projections tolawmakers. However, the White House may be able to win someconcessions from Congress in the wake of the Gulf war, theseofficials said.   At his briefing for reporters, Gen. Schwarzkopf stressedthat, working with the American Red Cross, he wanted to beginthe return of prisoners of war as quickly as possible. As ofyesterday, the only captives released so far were Bob Simon,the CBS correspondent, and his three-man crew who had spentnearly six weeks in Iraqi custody.   ---   Walter S.
