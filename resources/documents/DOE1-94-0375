To date, thirteenMember Countries of the Nuclear Energy Agency have developed nuclearenergy programmes, contributing more than 20% of the total electricitygeneration in the OECD area. Thus, nuclear power is viewed as an essentialcomponent of the energy policies of many OECD countries. Yet there isa wide diversity of attitudes among its members towards nuclear power,ranging from a heavy reliance on the atom for the supply of electricityto a definite policy of foregoing this energy option, at least for thetime being. Behind this overall important role played by nuclear powerin the OECD area is the recognition that nuclear energy is - along withcoal - one of the cheapest ways to generate electricity, with definiteadvantages over other sources as regards the impact on the environmentand security of supplies. The paper reviews the current situation inthe main parts of the nuclear fuel cycle, quantitatively and qualitatively,from uranium supply and demand to waste storage and disposal. In spiteof this favourable potential, the outlook for nuclear power in the OECDarea is influenced by a range of factors: slow growth of the demand forelectricity, uncertain public confidence, radioactive waste managementissues, etc. The recent accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plantcreated not only a shock, but also a renewed public and political awarenessof the need to maintain nuclear plant safety at the highest possiblelevels. While this accident did not place in technical doubt the designand safety features of reactors in the OECD area, there are lessons tobe drawn for nuclear energy worldwide. The unique safety co-operationamongst OECD countries may well serve as a model to achieve this objective.</TEXT></DOC>
