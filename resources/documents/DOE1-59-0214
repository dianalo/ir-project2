An explicit solution isfound to be expressible in terms of known solutions representing theradiation filled Robertson--Walker universe with a cosmological term.In the case that the rotating fluid is radiation, the discussion of themodel is considerably simplified. How the time scale of transition intoa pseudo-de Sitter stage, as observed by an observer following the rotatingfluid, is affected by vorticity is also studied.</TEXT></DOC>
