Subroto, secretary general of the 13-nation Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, said the officials would meetprivately before resuming a third round of formal talks Mondayevening.   ``We are still deliberating about the best way to achieve (our)goal,'' he said at a press conference at the Geneva hotel wheremeetings were held Sunday.   The ministers are thrashing out whether they can raise theircurrent production ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a day in thefinal quarter of the year without weakening crude prices.   Led by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, they have beenpumping about 22 million barrels a day _ well over their officialcap.   Prices have been steady in recent months, but they are stillabout $1 under the cartel's target of $18 a barrel.   Iraqi Oil Minister Issam al-Chalabi said there were two or threeproposals on the ministers' bargaining table. He declined toelaborate.   ``It seems that the ceiling is the imminent problem,'' he toldreporters after the meeting.   He said he favored an increase in the ceiling, with the extraamount shared proportionately among all 13 members. Each would geta certain amount added to its individual supply quota.   However, Chalabi suggested the ministers would defer untilNovember any resolution of the sticky issue of fairly disbributingproduction shares.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates want bigger slices of theoutput pie. To press their demands, they have been producing asmuch as double their quotas of about 1 million barrels each.   In June, some ministers indicated they would try to settle thequota issue at this meeting. But it seemed Sunday that members werenow less willing to do so.   Going into the weekend meetings, the ministers were divided overwhat to do in the fourth quarter of the year.   Some worry that lifting their production ceiling even a littlecould cause prices to fall.   Others are convinced demand is strong enough to absorb asubstantial boost in output.   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh, whose country needspetroleum revenue for reconstruction after its eight-year war withIraq, said, ``This situation is good. It's not very bad.'' Heapparently was referring to crude prices, which have held fairlysteady in recent months.   However, some blame the gap between current prices and thetarget on Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates pumping above theirlimits.   One faction argues the cheating has deprived their countries ofadditional oil revenues. A rise in the ceiling to the actual dailyproduction of about 22 million barrels would cut into theoverproducers' volume and let all benefit from more sales, they say.   The easiest option would be to roll over their current supplycap of 19.5 million barrels a day for the rest of the year. Butthat, some say, would be tantamount to approving the cheating.   Algeria's Sadek Boussena, Libya's Fawzi Shakshuki and othershave expressed concern prices are not stronger. They would like tokeep the current ceiling. Iraq's Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi hassaid he would like increased production, as Kuwait and the UnitedArab Emirates reportedly do.   Subroto has predicted demand for the cartel's oil will reach 22million barrels a day in the October-December period.   There is no indication how long the current meeting will last.</TEXT></DOC>
