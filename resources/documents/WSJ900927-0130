In an interview, the 62-year-old politician also confirmedthat Bonn is negotiating a hefty military aid package forTurkey, in addition to West Germany's usual militaryassistance.</LP><TEXT>   West Germany has been criticized in the U.S. for draggingits feet in supporting military operations in the Gulf. Thismonth, after weeks of domestic wrangling, Bonn committeditself to a package totaling 3.3 billion marks ($2.1billion), half to aid U.S. forces and the rest to be dividedas economic aid among Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, the threenations hurt most by the economic blockade of Iraq. The newmilitary aid package for Turkey would be separate.   But even such efforts to deflect criticism have begun tobackfire. The aid package for Turkey, which one West Germannews report suggests could be valued at 6.5 billion marks, isat least partly based on military hardware Bonn will inheritfrom East Germany after unification Wednesday. Mr.Stoltenberg dismisses criticism that Bonn is using thedissolution of East Germany's military as a convenient sourceof aid for other nations.   Bonn was embarrassed this week by reports, laterconfirmed, that much of the equipment it's giving to the U.S.will also come from East German storehouses. The defenseminister says it isn't decided which goods will come fromEast Germany, but he didn't rule out the possibility that asmuch as half of the material provided to the U.S. will comefrom that former communist nation.   Mr. Stoltenberg is clearly unhappy with a constitutionalprovision that forbids Bonn from sending troops outside thearea of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But he saysthere isn't any way around it, short of a constitutionalamendment. &quot;I think this is a weak point. It'sunsatisfactory,&quot; he says.   The issue is too sensitive for the West Germans to tacklewhen all thoughts are on unification and united-Germanelections in December. Mr. Stoltenberg, a leading member ofChancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, says heexpects a new parliament to deal with the subject early nextyear. By then the issue may be moot.   Mr. Stoltenberg says events in the Middle East havealready taken away much of the euphoria associated with theend of Europe's East-West confrontation.   &quot;The Gulf crisis makes very clear . . . that we still havedangerous centers of tension in the neighborhood of Europe,&quot;he says. &quot;Islamic fundamentalism, Arabian nationalism, thebuildup of a modern military potential -- including, as webelieve, chemical and biological weapons -- this is a verydangerous combination and underlines for us the paramountimportance of our Atlantic alliance for the future.&quot; Mr.Stoltenberg says a unified Germany, at least under theright-of-center Christian Democrats, will remain firmly inthe Western alliance.   The question is what the alliance will look like. Mr.Stoltenberg says tighter economic and political links shouldmake for a stronger &quot;European pillar&quot; in Western defenses.Indeed, the West German defense minister is unequivocallypro-U.S. &quot;There is no progress without a strong link betweenNorth America and Western Europe,&quot; he says.   Still, both sides of the Atlantic are getting ready fordeep cuts in European forces. Conventional arms talks betweenNATO and what's left of the East's Warsaw Pact are expectedto cut numbers across the board; Germany has pledged to trimthe size of its unified forces to 370,000 within four years.   But foreign troops stationed on German soil will remainpart of the West's defense equation, says Mr. Stoltenberg.&quot;We are prepared for a substantial reduction of Americantroops in Germany and Central Europe, and I think it will gobeyond those 60,000 who are set to go out in the next fewyears,&quot; he says, referring to a U.S. plan to shrink the U.S.presence to 190,000 troops, from the current 250,000.   &quot;But we believe it's very important, even at a lowerlevel, to keep substantial U.S. forces in Central Europe,&quot;says Mr. Stoltenberg, who estimates that total foreign trooppresence in Germany in five years could be 150,000 to170,000, compared with more than 400,000 today. He opposesany single nation removing all of its troops, a move he sayswould send the wrong signal about the future of the alliance.   But while he's a firm believer in the alliance, Mr.Stoltenberg doesn't see NATO expanding to include any of thenew democracies of Eastern Europe. Instead, he foresees anera in which these nations cooperate with the West on a widerange of issues through the much looser structure of theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a groupingthat brings together East and West European nations, theU.S., and Canada. Military matters, such as the Middle East,can be dealt with much more easily in the United Nations, hesays.</TEXT></DOC>
