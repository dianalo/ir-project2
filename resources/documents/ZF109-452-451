Historically, the computer and communicationindustries have been separate, although both worked with electronicallyencoded information and shared similar technology.andP;  The regulations that keptcomputing and communication apart began to crumble in 1956 when the FCC ruledthat Hust-a-Phone could attach equipment to the ATandamp;T network under specialcircumstances.andP;  In 1959 they opened a portion of the microwave spectrum, andthe 1968 Carterphone case allowed all kinds of equipment to be tied to thenetwork.andP;  Today, IBM is in the communication business and ATandamp;T marketscomputers, but many feel that the distinction among computing, communication,news, and entertainment industries will blur or disappear.andM;The question is, who will lead the charge--the computer companies,entertainment companies, toy companies, or phone companies?andP;  To put itanother way, will the home computer swallow up the television set or will thetelevision set become a computer in disguise?andM;Not surprisingly, computer companies and entertainment companies havedifferent answers to this question, and the debate was brought into focus byannouncement at the Fifth Microsoft International CD-ROM Conference andExposition.andP;  Let us  look at the question of the home computer versus thesmar TV and then come back to some of the other interesting announcement atthe show and the current state of multimedia applications.andM;Compuvision: The HomeandM;ComputerandM;The idea of a home computer is not new.andP;  Figure 1 shows a Commodore PET(Personal Electronic Transactor), the first fully assembled appliancecomputer, designed for use by the general public at home and school.andP;  Apple,Texas Instruments, Atari, and Radio Shack also had early hopes for the homecomputer market, and IBM tried several years later with the PC Junior.andP;  Whereare all those home computers today?andP;  The installed base is large, but I willbet that most are installed on the shelves of hall closets.andM;Hope springs eternal, however, and technology improves.andP;  In his address tothe CD-ROM Conference, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates stated that hiscompany's goal was to have a computer on every desk and in every home.andP;  Hefeels that multimedia, with the emotional richness of image and sound, is thekey to the home market.andP;  Gates, who works in close collaboration with Inteland IBM, outlined a phased approach.andP;  The phase one machine is available now;future versions may be capable of competing with a television set.andM;Gates' phase one machine is a fairly standard 286-based PC with a VGAdisplay, built in CD-ROM drive, and modest audio capability.andP;  The operatingsystem is DOS and Windows with multimedia extensions.andP;  Two companies.andO;Headstart and Tandy, already sell similar machines, and it is widely rumoredthat IBM is preparing one.andP;  Gates described a base machine last year, andthere has been a notable change.andP;  The CPU has been changed from an 80386 toan 80286.andP;  My guess is that this change was made to keep the cost down forthe school market, where IBM hopes to sell many multi-media computers.andP;  (Theyhave also just announced an agressively priced network software bundle forschools).andM;We will return to the phase one machine later, but a potential TV-killer wasalso outlined by Gates and representative of Intel and IBM.andP;  A TV killerneeds full-motion video, for which Gates is counting on Intel's DVI(TM)(Digital Video Interactive) technology.andP;  DVI is a proprietary scheme forcompressing motion video and recording it on a CD-ROM disc (see the July 1989Communications for a full description).andP;  At the conference, Intel announced asingle-board DVI controller (to be marketed by IBM) and they promised thenext generation would be out in 1992-93.andP;  The new replaces two older boards,cut cost, and improves performance.andP;  The major change, however, is theavailability of real-time, symmetrical recording (RTV) at 30 frames persecond.andM;Earlier versions of DVI required batch processing for compression to produceproduction level video (PLV).andP;  With RTV it is possible for a user to digitizeand store video images from a camera or other source in real time.andP;  That notonly means vastly simplified production of multi-media discs; it means livevideo communication.andP;  One of the hits of the conference was a demonstrationof RTV over a token ring network.andM;The following table shows Intel's DVI roadmap for full-screen,30-frame-per-second DVI for the next few years:andM;Intel predicts $50 DVI chips in 1991, and the next DVI board is expected todouble performance at one third less cost.andP;  DVI is expected to be included onthe motherboard of 1995 computers.andM;As nice as a computer with DVI on the motherboard would be, I suspect I wouldstill watch &quot;The Simpsons&quot; on a television set.andP;  The real TV killer will notbe available until around the year 2000.andP;  Intel senior vice president DavidHouse has speculated about a possible Intel CPU at that time.andP;  He notes thatsince the original 4004 microprocessor in 1971, the number of transistorsthat can economically be put on one silicon chip doubles about every 18months.andP;  Extrapolating, House foresees a 50-to-100-million transistor CPU atthe end of the decade (see Figure 2).andM;What might Intel do with those transistors?andP;  Integration is one possibility.andO;When IBM announced the 286-based At in 1984, a typical motherboard had 170chips, plus memory.andP;  By 1987, a PS/2 of similar complexity was down to 70chips.andP;  In 1990, a 32-bit PC will be down to 10 chips, and by 1993, one.andP;  LANsupport and other functions will continue to be brought onto ever faster CPUchips.andP;  By the end of the decade, House predicts a 2,000-MIP, 386-compatibleCPU which includes DVI.andP;  That might be a TV killer.andM;Teleputer: Smart TVandM;That is the party line according to Intel, IBM, and Microsoft, but theentertainment world has also been busy.andP;  In the summer of 1991, Sony andPhilips will roll out CD-1, an interactive CD player designed to be connectedto a television set.andP;  A CD-I player contains an optical disc drive, aMotorola 680X0 CPU, and a megabyte of memory, but it will be marketed as anenhanced CD player, not a computer.andP;  It is not backed by computer companies,but entertainment companies.andP;  CD-I ads run in Variety, not Communications.andM;A CD-I disc may contain data in a variety of formats:andM;Text: 1-or-2 byte characters.andP;  When used, the second byte specifies displayattributes.andM;Sound: Four levels ranging from 16 hours of AM radio quality monaural soundto 1 hour of audio CD quality stereo.andM;Image: Five levels of image, including natural still pictures, RGB with 5bits per color, 7- and 8-bit color lookup tables, and specially encodedanimation sequences.andM;Motion Video: Seventy-two minutes of full-frame motion video, which may beaccompanied by FM quality monaural sound.andM;The hardware also supports special effects such as fades, pans over largevirtual images, and independent video planes that are automatically layeredor superimposed upon each other (two planes for images, and one each for thecursor and motion video).andM;CD-I was announced at the 1986 CD-ROM Conference, and in looking back to anarticle I wrote at the time, I note the prediction that players would be onthe market by Christmas, 1988.andP;  When that date came and went, and DVI wasannounced, there was a tendency to write off CD-I.andM;Bringing CD-I to market has been delayed, but Philips and Sony have been busyin the meantime.andP;  An interim format, CD-ROM XA, was designed and is now beingshipped.andP;  CD-ROM XA provides CD-I audio and some of the CD-Image formats.andP;  Anindustrial training version of CD-I has also been developed.andP;  The player isbeing marketed in Europe and the United States, and Philips has formed jointventures to develop CD-I training material.andP;  Philips has also been lining updrive suppliers.andP;  Panasonic, Yamaha, Pioneer, Sharp, Ricoh, Sanyo, andFujitsu have all developed prototype players or disclosed plans for doing so.andO;But more important than all of this, Philips and Sony have been working onsoftware.andM;For its part, Sony has been buying American record and film companies.andO;Philips, in partnership with PolyGram, a record company and audio CD marketerand distributor, has formed American Interactive Media (AIM) and sistercompanies in Japan and Europe.andP;  AIM is a CD-I publisher, but in the earlystages they were acting as a CD-I midwife, developing some titles of theirown and supporting third party developers with expertise and money.andP;  Thesuccess of Audio CDs has left Philips and PolyGram with lots of the latter.)andO;Rand-McNally, Time-Life, Grolliers, Children's Televsion Workshop, ABCSports, Hanna-Barbera, Caesar's World, Britanica Software, Parker Brothers,and The Sporting News are among the companies working on CD-I titles forpublication by AIM.andM;AIM promises to have 26 titles at the time of the CD-I introduction.andP;  Theyinclude entertainment (board, video, and adventure games, as well as aninteractive biography of Frank Sinatra), special interest (how-to, sports,and museum tours), and children's titles (&quot;Sesame Street,&quot; coloring books,the Bible, and others).andP;  Many of these are in prototype today (see Figure 3).andO;For example, the Palm Springs Golf Open (3a) uses two graphic layers.andP;  Thebackground layer is 360-degree photos of a golf course in Palm SpringsCalifornia.andP;  The foreground is used for surprisingly, good animation of agolfer swinging, the ball travelling and then coming to rest.andP;  The userselects a club, aims the player, and controls the speed and angle of theswing.andP;  An ABC golf commentator and a caddy offer commentary.andP;  The disc istechnically the most impressive one I have seen.andM;Treasurers of The Smithsonian (3b) is a disc of surrogate travel to theSmithsonian Institute.andP;  You steer through over 200 exhibits at art, naturalwonders, and science.andP;  You can also interact with the exhibits.andP;  In one youplay a harpsichord; in another you break the sound barrier or walk around astatue.andP;  If this disc is successful, one can imagine similar tours of manyother museums.andM;The Oldies jukebox disc (3c) has 39 songs from 1950s and 60s performers suchas the Platters, the Diamonds, and roy Orbison.andP;  You can see the albumcovers, liner notes, background trivia, light shows, and lyrics while themusic plays.andP;  Control options let you start, stop, and replay, usinginteractive controls or with a simply scripted play list for unattendedlistening.andP;  The Classical Jukebox will offer classical music in the sameformat.andP;  Once the format is worked out,it will be easy for worked owning therights to the material to produce other jukebox titles.andM;Iwould not presume to evaluate the content of these early discs, but aftertrying CD-I out, I still have the same concern that I had in 1986--thepoint-and-click input device.andP;  The demo players I have sen use mice, but amouse will not work while sitting in an easy chair or in the hand of a childon the floor.andP;  The world will beat a path to the inventor of a good easychairpoint-and-click device.andP;  (Recliner chairs with trackballs!)andM;AIM has learned a lot about developing for CD-I.andP;  for example, Seth Meyers,director of production of interactive technology at the Children's TelevisionWorkshop, noted that in developing the Sesame Street disc, they learned thatwhile children will watch a muppet on TV for a long time, they want to dosomething as soon as you give them a mouse.andP;  That means you cannot writeanything that is longer than about 15 seconds for children's CD-I.andP;  (Willtoday's TV news clips seem like in-depth coverage to these children?) AIM hasformed a sister company to market the development systems they use in-house,and they are available for Mac, PC, and Sun workstations.andM;Who will dominate the &quot;computainment&quot; industry in the long run?andP;  It may beone of these groups or someone else.andP;  maybe it will be the phone companies orNintendo.[TM]  Perhaps the pie will be evenly divided.andP;  At this point, theentertainment companies, with their focus on software and their provenexpertise at producing and marketing consumer electronics, may be in thelead.andM;Multimedia TodayandM;We can speculate on the year 2000, but much is happening today.andP;  Intel andPhillips are not the only ones working on image-recording formats andcompression techniques.andP;  ISO and CCITT have committees for internationalimage compression standards.andP;  They have formed The Joint Bi-level Image Group(JBIG) for fax or line-art images, the Joint Photographic Experts Group(JPEG) for continuous tone stills, and the Moving Picture Coding Expert Group(MPEG) for motion sequences.andM;The JPEG Committee has been meeting since 1986, and Chairman Gregory Wallaceestimates that a final standard may be available around the middle of 1991.andO;Two companies, C-Cube Microsystems and Electronics for Imaging (EFIe, havedeveloped products based on the current draft of the standard.andP;  EFI ismarketing source code for JPEG software, and C-Cube markets a JPEG chip andsoftware package.andP;  figure 4 shows an image before and after, 24:1 times JPEGcompression using EFI's software.andP;  Can you tell which is &quot;before&quot; and whichis &quot;after?&quot;andM;The JPEG compression algorithm runs in two steps, a discreet cosine transformon a sliding 8 x 8 pixel window followed by Huffman encoding.andP;  The firststage discards some information, so reproductions are not exact.andP;  Colorinformation is sampled at a lower rate than luminance information (sincecolor chages are more gradual in natural images than luminance chages), andhigh-frequency color inforamtion, to which the human eye is relativeinsensitive, is discarded.andP;  Software compression on a Macintosh Ilex takeslong enough for one to have a cup of coffee of perhaps lunch, depending onthe degree of compression and the resolution and uniformity of the image, butC-Cube's chip compresses a 25MB, 8.5-by 11-inch 300-dot-per-inch.andP;  24-bitcolor image in less than a second.andM;The compression ratio is under program control, and 20 times compressionshows little visible loss.andP;  The JPEG standard is being widely adopted incommunication, computer, and consumer products.andP;  JPEG will probably be partof the standards for color and gray-scale FAX, PostScript, wire photos, andcompound documents.andP;  Intel and Philips have gone their own proprietary waysthus far, but both are committed to supporting JPEG and MPEG.andP;  It will taketime (telephone unification in the United States took about hafl a century),but eventually there will be common standards.andM;Like CD-I, DVI is beginning to be used for industrial applications.andP;  At theconference, Reinhard Ziegler of Andersen Consulting spoke of DVIapplications.andP;  Zeigler's approach to finding potential DVI applications is tolook at areas where video tape is already being used (See Figure 5).andP;  Oneexample is analyst tape operators setting up complex production machinery.andO;In a motion-day version of Taylor and Gilbreth's time and motion study, theycapture several hours of setup time and analyze the constituent steps.andO;Figure 5a shows an analyst building a flow diagram of a setup operation andassociating an automatically timed segment of video footage with each step.andO;The video is displayed in the upper left, VCR-style controls are under thevideo, and the evolving process diagram is on the right.andM;Another application is a railroad geographic information system (5b).andP;  Videofootage of their track routes was made by mounting a camera on a train.andP;  Theuser makes surrogate trips over train routes, while controlling movement andmonitoring progress on a map.andP;  Objects, for example, can be bridges, can bevisually inspected, and enginnering diagrams and other data can be retrievedfrom a database.andM;Andersen has also transferred video training material for Marion Merrell Dowpharmaceutical sales people to DVI (5c).andP;  The user selects a topic, andtraining material is displayed.andP;  If he or she clicks on the &quot;define&quot; buttonduring a presentation, the index of a video glossary is presented, with thelast term used highlighted.andP;  After watching a glossary clip the would resumethe presentation.andP;  The system can also quiz the user.andP;  Of these threesystems, only this one is in actual use; however, like AIM.andP;  Andersen haslearned a lot by these early efforts.andM;IBM is making significant inroads into Apple's territory.andP;  Nearly everymultimedia prsentation one sees on the Macintosh uses audio recording andediting hardware and software from Farallon Computing or Macro-Mind'sDirector, an audio-video scripting system.andP;  Both of these companies, andothers, announced that they are working on PC-compatible products.andP;  Manyother Macintosh developers are working on applications using MicrosoftWindows, and the runtime portion of MacroMind Director will be included in afuture &quot;multi-media&quot; release of Windows.andP;  MacroMind demonstrated a Directorapplication that had been developed on a Mac running simultaenously on A Macand a Pc.andP;  Apple's window of uniqueness may be sliding shut, and they mustinnovate and cut prices.andM;Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard have taken a lead in CD-ROM distribution ofsoftware and documentation.andP;  Last year HP reported customer satisfaction withthe distribution of UNIX[TM] documentation on CD-ROM.andP;  Now they offersoftware and documentation for the HP-3000 minicomputer on CD-ROM.andP;  Customerswho need several manuals will find it convenient, while also saving money.andM;Microsoft has bundled three Macintosh applications, Word, Excel, andPowerPoint, on a CD-ROM.andP;  The disc includes manuals, training materials, andthird party add-on software and data files, and it costs considerably lessthan the three programs purchased separately.andP;  Customers have the option ofpaying $15 for printed copies of the manuals, but according to productmanager Eileen Hart, less than one percent have ordered them.andP;  Presumablythey find the on-line documentation convenient.andP;  Three other companiesannounced plans to distribute software, manuals, and complementary materialon CD-ROM.andP;  Letraset will distribute publishing software, SuperMac willdistribute image processing software, and Farallon will distribute multimediapresentation software.andM;Apple has not yet committed to support of a high-tech digital format such asCD-I or DVI, but they have the low-tech lead in using a computer to controlconventional audio CD and video disc players.andP;  In one session, Tyler Peppel,manager for Media Integration at Apple, stated that VCRs would becomestandard Mac output devices.andP;  There will be direct video output on allproducts next year, and users will &quot;print&quot; to video tape instead of paper,using the Macintosh Chooser to select the VCR.andP;  Toshi Doi of Sony hinted thatby the time Macs have video output, Sony will have a three-to-four-hundreddollar VCR that is sufficiently precise to use it.andP;  Low-cost video output anda beefed up HyperCard-2 scripting language will help Apple to remaincompetitive with Windows-based PCs for low-end multimedia applications.andM;Robert Abel's presentation was the creative highlight of this year'sconference, as it was last year.andP;  Abel and his collaborator demonstrated amultimedia explication of Tennyson's poem &quot;Ulysses.&quot;andP;  The interactive discincludes literary critics, actors, and students all performing originalmaterial, and a wealth of prerecorded images and video, such as Bill Moyer'sPBS interviews with Joseph Campbell.andP;  The disc deals with the poem, acting,poetic concepts, mythology, and heroism.andP;  For example, the disc includesCampbell talking about mythological heroism, critics talking about heroism inthe poem, and a montage of images of modern day heroes which end with theChinese student stepping in front of a tank during the Beijing protests.andM;Abel uses widely available tecnology--an IBM PS/2 controlling a standardvideo disc player--but creative filmmaking skill such as his is not widelyavailable.andP;  I was moved by his photomontage.andP;  Have you ever laughed or criedwhile running a computer program?andP;  If you want inspiratoin, order a videotape of Abel's presentation from GT Recording.andM;There are also new multimedia computers from Commodore and Tandy (Figure 6).andO;Since 1985, Commodore's Amiga has led in interfacing with televisionproduction equipment and MIDI music instruments, and it has had custom soundand video-processing chips.andP;  Their latest multimedia computer is the Amiga3000 (6a).andP;  The top model has a 25Mhz 68030, a math coprocessor, up to 16MBof memory, 9 100MB hard drive, and several custom chips.andP;  The price is wellbelow comparable Macintoshes.andP;  Options for Ethernet, Novell Netware, and UNIXare available.andM;Perhaps more important, Commodore will bundle AmigaVision, a multimediaauthoring system, with every Amiga 3000.andP;  AmigaVision is an iconicprogramming language in which you build a program by stringing together iconsthat represent commands.andP;  Command parameters are specified by filling indialog boxes.andP;  The imperative commands typically play a video or audiosequence, and there are control constructs for looping, branching, and userinteraction.andP;  Commodore is like IBM's competitors in the 1960s -- heirhardware is a very good deal for the price, but hardware is only the tip ofthe iceberg (see Figure 7).andM;Tandy has taken a more mainstream approach than commodore.andP;  they listened toBill Gates' description of phase-one multimedia PCs and built the 2500 XL(6b).andP;  It is a typical AT-compatible but adds DOS in ROM, a CD-ROM drive, andan 8-bit, bi-directional, digital-analog converter for sound and speech.andP;  Inorder to test its mettle as a multimedia machine, I tried it out withBrittanica software's Compton's Multimedia Encyclopedia, which won theSoftware Publishers Association Award for best new use of a computer and thefirs annual Creative Applications Award from Philips-DuPont Optical Company.andM;The encyclopedia is truly a multimedia product.andP;  According to the publisher,it includes the full text of the 19-volume, 5,200-article, 8,784,000-word,1989 edition of the Compton's encyclopedia; 15,800 pictures, maps, diagrams;60 minutes of recorded voice and sound; 45 animated sequences; Webster'sIntermediate Dictionary (65,000 entries); and Jostens' word processingprogram.andP;  That is a lot of information, but there are many ways to find it.andO;You can use keyword searches, an alphabetical title indes, a timeline runningfrom 1492 to the present, a map of the world, or a hierarchical topic tree.andM;With so much information and so many ways to retrieve it, one could becomeconfused, but that is not the case.andP;  The user interface is very simple.andP;  Iwas able to sample each feature listed above without looking at the manual.andO;there are also good navigational aids, such as an outline list of topics youhave visited in the past, bookmarks, and hypertext links between relatedmaterial.andP;  My major criticism of the user interface is that there are notenough of these connections.andP;  For example, to hear John F. Kennedy (&quot;ask notwhat your country can do for you&quot;) or richard M. Nixon (&quot;I'm not a crook&quot;)speak, you must find them in the historical timeline.andP;  You cannot get totheir speeches by reading through the Kennedy or Nixon articles.andM;Of course, such cross-indexing is labor intensive, and as it is, this is avery ambitious project.andP;  It took over 100 person years to adapt the printedversion to CD-ROM.andP;  The program is targeted to schools and carries a heftyprice tag.andP;  If the price were lower, I imagine there would be a largeconsumer market for this disc.andP;  I would be among them.andM;The disc is also a test of Bill Gates' phase one mulumedia computer, pointingout its limitations.andP;  For a start, audio retrieval times averaged fourseconds for the ones I tried, and the sound quality through the 8-bit DAC ispoor.andP;  Britanica agrees that the built-in 8-bit sound is inadequate and willsoon ship a version that uses audio CD recording.andP;  A digital signal processora la the NeXT computer would be nice.andM;Photo quality is also limited.andP;  The 8-bit, VGA color photos are soft andblurry--definitely not television quality.andP;  Video speed could also be better.andO;Displaying a page of text takes 3.1 seconds, switching to video mode anddisplaying a picture 4.8, and returning to text mode 2.6.andP;  The animatedsequences are particularly poor.andP;  They are about 3-3/8 by 4-3/8 inches.andP;  Theimages are fuzzy, and calling up an animation takes about six seconds.andP;  Theones I tried ran at two to four frames per second, and they had from 14 to 23frames.andP;  Dictionary access evidently requires an extra seek or two, becausethe average time to find a word was 7.7 seconds.andP;  Some of these limitationsare due to the quality of the display and audio hardware, others due to slowCD-ROM access time, others to limited media capacity, and others to the speedof the 10Mhz AT.andP;  Each will improve with time, and there is room for them todo so.andM;If it sounds as though I am closing on a negative note, let me point out thanin spite of the limitations, this is a very useful dise.andP;  Looking up adictionary word may take 7.7 seconds, but how long does it take with aprinted dictionary?andP;  I am out of space, but I should say that there are otherterrific multimedia CD-ROMs on the market.andP;  Warner New Media's disc onMozart's Magic Flute and Voyager's disc on Beethoven's Ninth Symphony are thetwo best pieces of computer-assisted instruction I have ever seen.andP;  If youhave doubts as to the eventual value of computer-based &quot;edutainment,&quot; checkthem out.andP;  I will review some excellent multimedia disscs in future columns,but if you cannot wait, these disc may justify a CD-ROM drive for your Mac.andM;PointersandM;Those considering in-house CD-ROM production should request a copy of the&quot;Corporate Guide to Optical Publishing,&quot; a free 39-page booklet fromDataware.andP;  Although Dataware markets development systems, this booklet ishighly informative and is not a sales pitch.andP;  Dataware Technologies, Inc.,andO;222 Third Street, Suite 3300, Cambridge, MA 02142, (800) 344-5849.andM;&quot;CD-I, A Designer's Overview,&quot; Philip.andP;  International, Inc., McGraw Hill, NewYork, 1988.andP;  Written at the technical manager level, this book introducesCD-I, the recording formats and technology, applications, and applicationdesign and development.andP;  It is a good start if you are trying to decidebetween DVI and CD-I.andP;  For an introduction to DVI, see the July 1989 issue ofCommunications.andM;For more detail on JPEG see Gregory Wallace, &quot;Overview of the JPEG(ISO/CCITT) Still Image Compression Standard,&quot; Proceedings of the SPIESymposium on Electronic Image Science and Technology, Santa Clara, CA,February, 1990, or write ANSI for the preliminary specification.andM;Patrick P.
