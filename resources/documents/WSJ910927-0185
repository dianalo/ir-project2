Like its companion volume, &quot;Poverty and Compassion&quot; is amonumental achievement, moving among personalities, ideas,literature, statistics and politics with the confidence of ascholar who has utterly mastered her material. Ms. Himmelfarbwrites elegantly, with a finely shaded ironic affection forher Victorian protagonists and more than occasional humor.The scholarship itself is immaculate and daunting -- she canspend three pages describing the origins of the word&quot;unemployment&quot; and include two usages antedating its firstcitation in the Oxford English Dictionary. &quot;Poverty andCompassion&quot; provides more evidence that Ms. Himmelfarb is oneof America's great historians.</LP><TEXT>   The problem is to get the right people to read this book-- namely, much of official Washington and its policyadvisers. Without laboring the parallels, Ms. Himmelfarbdraws a three-dimensional portrait of how the Victoriansconfronted something very like our underclass. The issuesthey agonized over were astonishingly similar to the ones weagonize over today -- the comparative roles of structuralfactors and personal behavior in creating an underclass,workfare vs. welfare, what to do about the children, themerits of government programs vs. private philanthropy,relative poverty vs. absolute poverty, how to measurepoverty. There is a continual shock of recognition in reading&quot;Poverty and Compassion,&quot; and with it a continual challengeto think in new ways about familiar problems -- a challengethat is all the more effective because the book is about anera so far removed from 1991's politics and prejudices.   Ms. Himmelfarb's account is especially timely on twocounts. The first is her description of charitable work inthe slums of late Victorian England. Regarding the slums ofour own time, something approaching a consensus now acceptsthat centralized bureaucracies are not going to make a dentin the behaviors that define the underclass. &quot;Something else&quot;has to be tried. Late Victorian England tried something elsein the form of a highly personalized system of charitycasework. It was nothing like the Lady Bountiful caricaturethat has been used to dismiss it. It was sophisticated,carefully thought through, immensely complicated andextensive -- and it seems to have worked in ways and to adegree that historians are just beginning to explore. Ms.Himmelfarb's description of the system and its intellectualunderpinnings is a source book for anyone trying to thinkabout how to make a difference in inner-city America.   The second signal contribution of &quot;Poverty and Compassion&quot;is suggested by Ms. Himmelfarb's subtitle, &quot;The MoralImagination of the Late Victorians.&quot; During the past fewyears, American policy analysts have gingerly begun tocontemplate the possibility that concepts such as &quot;character&quot;and &quot;virtue&quot; might be relevant to thinking about theunderclass. But aside from a few iconoclasts such as James Q.Wilson, social scientists who have come of age sincemidcentury have been both untutored and unthoughtful on suchquestions. &quot;Poverty and Compassion&quot; presents in rich detailthe intellectual building blocks for thinking about them.   In this regard, Ms. Himmelfarb's two volumes together makeit possible for a contemporary reader to see the progressionof Victorian thought as a whole, and the picture isdispiriting. &quot;The Idea of Poverty&quot; was peopled by figureslike Smith, Malthus, Cobbett, Carlyle and Mill, who, right orwrong, raised fundamental questions about poverty, humannature and the human condition. Ms. Himmelfarb's leadcharacters in &quot;Poverty and Compassion&quot; -- people such asCharles Booth, Seebohm Rountree, Sidney and Beatrice Webb,Arnold Toynbee and Alfred Marshall -- are not only smaller inhistorical terms, but dealt with questions that seem to havebecome more cramped and technical as the century drew to aclose. It is as if the advance of scientific rigor in thesocial sciences inevitably tended to compartmentalize theproblems of poverty, separating moral considerations fromeconomic ones.   By the end of &quot;Poverty and Compassion,&quot; Ms. Himmelfarb isdescribing the ascendancy of the views that gave rise to thewelfare state. As late as 1886, Beatrice Potter had writtenin opposition to a public-works project that the properremedy for London's underclass was a policy of &quot;sternnessfrom the state, and love and self-devotion from individuals,a very old and self-evident remedy.&quot; Only eight years later,as Beatrice Webb, she held to much the same moralsensibility, but she had decided the state could be used forgood after all. She confided to her diary the very credo ofthe 20th-century version of Lady Bountiful. &quot;We have littlefaith in the `average sensual man,'&quot; she wrote. &quot;We do notbelieve that he can do much more than describe his grievances. . . We wish to introduce into politics the professionalexpert, to extend the sphere of government by adding to itsenormous advantages of wholesale and compulsory management,the advantage of the most skilled entrepreneur.&quot;   Did Beatrice Potter Webb get smarter as she got older, ordid she in fact lose sight of truths that she had onceunderstood? Ms. Himmelfarb does not force eitherinterpretation on the reader, but no one can read her bookwithout grappling with such questions -- regarding not onlythe Victorian age, but more urgently our own.   ---   Mr. Murray, Bradley Fellow at the American EnterpriseInstitute, is the author of &quot;In Pursuit&quot; (Simon andamp; Schuster)and &quot;Losing Ground&quot; (Basic).</TEXT></DOC>
