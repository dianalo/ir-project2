David Osterfeld, who teaches politics at Saint Joseph's Collegein Rensselaer, Ind., argues that it is useful to a country if agovernment charges $1,000 for a license to enter an occupation butan official issues one for a bribe of $900.   ``The reduced cost facilitates entry into the field, therebyintroducing an element of competition into an otherwisemonopolistic situation,'' he says in an article called ``Corruptionand Development.''   Osterfeld's article appears in the current issue of thequarterly ``Journal of Economic Growth,'' published by the NationalChamber Foundation. The foundation is a research affiliate of theU.S. Chamber of Commerce, a private business organization.   The trade bill now awaiting President Reagan's signature willease the effect of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and make iteasier for executives here to defend themselves when their agentsare charged with paying bribes abroad.   Osterfeld doesn't defend all bribes, saying that some are``wicked.''   ``For instance, the alleged involvement of Panama`s (militaryruler Gen. Manuel) Noriega in the drug trade is a case ofcorruption in all of its wickedness, where society is clearlyhurt,'' he says.   ``However, a Peruvian street vendor's bribing of a low-levelgovernment official in order to obtain a license to sell his wares,while also a corrupt act, makes a positive contribution tosociety,'' he wrote.   Osterfeld says that even if the bribe is several times the sizeof the license fee _ as an Indian investigating committee found wasoften the case _ the bribe is still useful.   ``(It) not only benefits the bureaucrat, but, more importantly,insures that the licenses are allocated efficiently, since thoseable to offer the highest bribes are the most productive andefficient firms,'' he adds.   There was disagreement from Lilia Ferro-Clerico, a Uruguayan whocoordinates Caribbean and Central American studies for JohnsHopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.   ``That's pretty far-fetched,'' she said in a telephone interview.   ``I don't think corruption is ever helpful. You have a parallelhere in the Pentagon scandal _ all the bribes did was to make itmore expensive for the taxpayer.''   Osterfeld defends what he calls ``expansive corruption,'' whichhe says increases chances for trade that benefits a country.   ``It entails increased competition and market flexibility,'' hesays.   ``The result is that the quantity of goods produced expands andtheir quality improves. It is, in short, characterized by theexpansion of the overall wealth of society.   ``(It) is morally defensible since its goal is to defend one'sown property as well as one's right to engage in voluntaryactivities.''   As examples of ``expansive corruption'' he suggests:   _Evading price controls or tariffs by bribes to officials topermit smuggling or black marketing.   _Bribes to evade licensing restrictions or controls onimmigration and emigration.   Bribing a judge in cases of smuggling, occupational licenses,black marketing and price controls are called ``defensive bribing''and Osterfeld classifies that as expansive as well.   ``Even if society becomes demoralized or disillusioned by suchcorruption, the effects may not be an impediment to development...,'' he adds.   He explains that the cynicism may lead to increased self-seekingthat furthers development.   Osterfeld concludes that ``expansive corruption'' is a responseto government restrictions on economic freedom. Those concernedabout it, who want economic development, should concentrate onreducing government action that tempts corruption, he says.</TEXT></DOC>
