And of the six Republican candidates, only Vice President George Bush unequivocally supported Mr. Reagan. &quot;It's a good deal,&quot; he said. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas said he's &quot;never let the president down yet&quot; but repeated his insistence on a chance to read the treaty and perhaps &quot;improve&quot; it on the Senate floor.    The others -- Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, former Gov. Pierre du Pont of Delaware, retired Gen. Alexander Haig and television evangelist Pat Robertson -- said they flatly oppose it.    Mr. Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev are scheduled to sign the intermediate-forces treaty here next week.    Democrats, who played down their differences on foreign policy, went at each other in the program's second hour devoted to domestic issues.    Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri accused Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, who has been surging in the polls recently, of being a &quot;promise-as-you-go&quot; Democrat who would never be able to achieve his promise of a balanced budget. &quot;Simonomics,&quot; he said, &quot;is really Reaganomics with a bow tie.&quot;    Not to be left out, former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona accused both Messrs. Gephardt and Simon of &quot;flimflam.&quot; He stood up and said he favored raising taxes and means testing in entitlement programs and dared his colleagues to join him. &quot;There aren't a lot of profiles in courage here,&quot; Mr. Babbitt said.    Later in the debate, the aggressive Mr. Babbitt turned his guns on Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. He demanded the governor name three specific reductions that would save several billions a year in domestic spending. Mr. Dukakis mentioned possible savings in reforms of health care for the elderly, but didn't respond with the details Mr. Babbitt had sought.    Democrats also were more supportive of the Central American peace process now under way with lukewarm support from Mr. Reagan. As Mr. Bush sat by silently, Republicans took turns attacking the process. Mr. Kemp indicated he would favor continued support of the Nicaraguan resistance as long as the Sandinista regime remained in power.    Democrats, seeming to act in concert, demanded to know at the outset how the Republicans stood on possible pardons for former White House aides under criminal investigation for their part in the Iran-Contra affair.    Mr. Kemp said he favored pardons for Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North and Navy Adm. John Poindexter. Gen. Haig and Mr. Robertson said the two men believed they were following orders in diverting arms-sale profits to assist Contra forces in Nicaragua. Mr. Bush defended the two aides as patriots without committing himself on the question of pardons. And Mr. Dole said no decision should be made until the independent counsel has completed his inquiry.    In the first hour, devoted to foreign policy, Democrats managed to attack Republican policies while soft-pedaling their own differences. The only sharp exchange occurred when Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee was accused by the Rev. Jesse Jackson of &quot;misrepresenting&quot; the truth about his and other Democrats' views on the American role in the Persian Gulf.    But Mr. Jackson appeared to be softening his own position by saying he wouldn't remove American flags from Kuwaiti tankers &quot;at this point.&quot;    Mr. Haig tried to mix it up with Vice President Bush. He said the vice president talks about being the &quot;co-pilot&quot; in the administration but suggested Mr. Bush in fact was flying &quot;on an economy ride in the back of the plane.&quot; He demanded to know what Mr. Bush advised the president when the administration decided to sell arms to Iran in exchange for American hostages.    Mr. Bush didn't answer the question directly and then simply dismissed Mr. Haig.    As the debate ebbed and flowed, some candidates rose and fell too. Sen. Gore, for example, whose specialty is foreign policy, appeared more forceful in exchanges with Mr. Gephardt on taxes and other fiscal issues. Mr. Bush may have benefited with Republicans in the audience as the sole GOP candidate supporting Mr. Reagan's arms-control position, but later he seemed less effective in discussing domestic matters. Mr. Dole, throughout, was as equivocal on important questions as he had been in an earlier, all-GOP debate.    The debate, with NBC correspondent Tom Brokaw as moderator, took place in the Kennedy Center here. Each party was allotted two 24-minute segments to discuss foreign policy and domestic issues, and candidates were asked to give their answers in 60-second bites. The best any of the candidates could expect under these rules was about eight minutes air time. But because this was the first debate on network TV, in prime time, with an audience some estimated might be 25 million, that time was still valuable for the candidates. </TEXT></DOC>
