The resignation of Mr. Butt, 48 years old, comes in thewake of Eagle Star's previously reported #189 million ($329.5million) pretax loss for the first half. The company had apretax profit of #21 million in the year-earlier period.</LP><TEXT>   The move also follows B.A.T Chairman Sir Patrick Sheehy'srecent remark that Eagle Star took an &quot;inappropriate degreeof risk&quot; in underwriting large amounts of mortgage-guaranteeinsurance, leaving it heavily exposed to the volatile realestate market in the United Kingdom.   Mr. Butt, who was unavailable for comment, had beenchairman of Eagle Star since 1987.   B.A.T, a British tobacco and financial services group,said that Brian Garraway, group deputy chairman, wasappointed executive chairman of Eagle Star. Mr. Garraway isalso currently responsible for B.A.T's overall financialservices sector, which includes Allied Dunbar in the U.K. andFarmers Group Inc. of the U.S.   Mark Duffy, an analyst with S.G. Warburg, said Mr. Buttwas once thought to be a possible successor to B.A.T's SirPatrick. He said Mr. Butt's resignation was probably theresult of board pressure, as well as &quot;political problems&quot;generated by Eagle Star's plans to dismiss about 1,000employees, or roughly 10% of its work force, in the nextthree years.</TEXT></DOC>
