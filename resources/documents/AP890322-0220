The bill, which Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., plans to introduce whenCongress returns from Easter recess, would authorize President Bushto appoint a National Capital Public Safety Director who would beresponsible for managing the district's police and fire departments,emergency ambulance service, and corrections system for a five-yearperiod.   ``The situation in the District of Columbia is clearly out ofcontrol,'' said Mark Strand, a Parris spokesman. ``The problem lieswith the leadership.''   Although Parris' plan would take control of the city's publicsafety services from Mayor Marion Barry Jr., the federal governmentwould not necessarily provide more money for running those programs.The bill calls for all salary and equipment expenses to be paid bythe city.   However, Strand said Parris hopes his bill will work in concertwith Bush administration drug policy coordinator William J. Bennett,who has said he may target the nation's capital for additionalfederal anti-drug funding.   Parris' move comes as the drug-related crime spree in thenation's capital has gained new attention.   Last year, a record 372 persons were killed in the district, andpolice blame 60 percent of those killings on drugs. That total _ andthe highest per-capital murder rate of any city in the country _gave Washington the ignominious distinction of ``Murder Capital ofAmerica.'' Through Wednesday, 119 murders had occurred in thedistrict during 1989, roughly twice as many as at the same time in1988.   Barry and others have complained that a lack of jail space hashampered law enforcement efforts, and Parris' bill would allow thepublic safety director to use unappropriated city government moneyto build new prison facilities, but would prohibit jails from beingbuilt outside the city's boundaries.   Parris, whose Northern Virginia district includes the city-runLorton Corrections Facility, is opposed to any expansion at that3,800-acre jail facility.   The city's Home Rule Charter, through which the district receivedlimited self-governance in 1973, gives Congress the authority totake control of any component of the city government.   Neither Barry nor Police Chief Maurice T. Turner were immediatelyavailable for comment.   In recent weeks, Bush administration officials and congressmenhave become increasingly concerned about Washington's crime problem.Parris' proposed action is the strongest yet.   Last week, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., touched off a furor bysuggesting that Congress should take control of the city policedepartment by establishing a ``federal constabulary'' to help slowthe crime spree.   Rudman's comments were endorsed by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.,who said he would cosponsor any legislation Rudman proposed.</TEXT></DOC>
