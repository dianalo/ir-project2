A federal jury found Davis guilty Oct. 12 of racketeering,extortion, attempted extortion and lying to an FBI agent during thegovernment's Operation Incubator probe of City Hall corruption.   Shepard said Davis had amassed an ``amazing record of corruptionfor someone just starting out in public office,'' extorting moneyfrom small businesses in his impoverished ward and accepting bribesfrom an FBI informant seeking lucrative city contracts.   Shepard told U.S. District Judge Ann Williams on Friday that oneof Davis' schemes involved putting his niece on the city payrolland then demanding that she kick back part of her salary.   Davis, clenching and unclenching his hands behind his back,stood silently before Ms. Williams.   Defense attorney Paul Bradley said he would appeal Davis'sentence.   Davis' conviction came three months after he was acquitted ofcharges that he had beaten and pistol-whipped a former secretaryover her cooperation with federal investigators in the OperationIncubator probe.   Davis narrowly lost a re-election bid in April 1987 in acampaign he ran from his cell. He was indicted in December 1986 onthe federal corruption charges and in February on state charges inthe pistol-whipping case.   Shepard and Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Pearl said Davisaccepted $5,000 from informant Michael Raymond, representing a NewYork company trying to land a multimillion dollar city contract tocollect unpaid parking tickets.</TEXT></DOC>
