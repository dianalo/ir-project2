The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Wednesdayreleased its final report on 1988 crash tests with results showingdrivers of vans and light trucks were at high risk of severe headinjuries in a crash.   Drivers of compact cars were least likely to have severe headinjuries, the agency's figures showed.   NHTSA reported the likelihood of injury as an index called thehead-injury criterion. The agency derived the index from monitoringdummies strapped into vehicles that were crashed into a fixedbarrier at 35 mph.   Seventeen of the 1988 vehicles tested produced a head-injurycriterion above 1,000, levels that show a high chance of severehead injury or death.   NHTSA cautioned it tested only one vehicle of each model, andadditional tests could produce varying results ``due to slightdifferences in the way vehicles are manufactured and equipped, ordue to slight variations in test conditions.''   Small differences in the test results should not be consideredsignificant, NHTSA said.   The Chevrolet G-20 van showed the greatest likelihood of headinjury to the driver, with an index of 3,665. The Mazda 929 4-doorcar, a large and mid-size model, showed the least likelihood, withan index of 273.   Tests of nine subcompact cars found five with an index of morethan 1,000. The average for the nine vehicles was 966.   Subcompact cars showing the greatest chance of head injury andthe criteria reported by NHTSA were the Dodge Colt 4-door stationwagon, 1,354; Nissan Pulsar NX 2-door hatchback, 1,134; VolkswagenFox 2-door, 1,114; Ford Festiva 2-door, 1,014; and the ToyotaTercel 2-door hatchback, 1,005.   Two of the nine compact cars tested produced head-injurycriteria exceeding 1,000. The average head-injury criterion forthat class of car was 887.   Compact cars most likely to cause head injury were the Peugeot505 GLS 4-door, 1,701, and the Nissan Sentra 4-door wagon, 1,047.   The tests found three out of nine large and mid-size cars withcriteria above 1,000. The average head-injury criterion for largerand mid-size cars was 921.   Large and mid-size cars with head-injury criteria exceeding1,000 were the Renault Medallion 4-door, 1,656, Buick Park Avenue4-door, 1,467; and the Chrysler New Yorker, 1,362.   The agency tested 10 vans and small trucks and found seven withhead-injury criteria exceeding 1,000. The average index for thevehicles was 1,491.   Trucks and vans showing the greatest likelihood of head injurywere the Chevrolet G-20 van, 3,665; Isuzu Spacecab pickup, 1,873;Chevrolet Astro Van, 1,603; Nissan NL LEV pickup, 1,528; MitsubishiMontero 4x4, 1,320; Volkswagen Vanagon, 1,320; and the Ford F-150pickup, 1,074.   NHTSA's 35 mph crash-test program is not used in the agency'sregulation of the automakers but is intended solely as a guide toconsumers, the agency said.   For regulatory purposes, each manufacturer crash tests its ownvehicles at 30 mph before the model-year begins. The results areusually kept secret for competitive reasons.   Vehicles that test with head-injury criteria exceeding 1,000must be redesigned before being placed on the market.   Also, NHTSA conducts random testing at 30 mph to check resultscertified by the automakers.   A 35 mph crash is one-third more severe than a 30 mph crash.</TEXT></DOC>
