The unusual contract calls for the U.S to buy supportequipment for 20 planned Patriot ground-to-air missilesystems in Italy -- even though the Italian government hasn'tyet appropriated funds for the missiles the equipment ismeant to be used with. The ground equipment is manufacturedat the same Raytheon facilities in Andover, Mass., where thecompany builds Patriot missiles.</LP><TEXT>   Since the Army has proposed phasing out purchases of themissiles during the next few years, Raytheon has pushed hardto win U.S. approval of the contract involving Italy. Withoutthe Army contract, Raytheon has said it would be forced tolay off hundreds of workers.   In response to questions, a spokesman for the Army'smissile command said that one of the major reasons forsigning the contract was to prevent disruptions or layoffs atRaytheon's missile-making operations. Senior Army acquisitionofficials previously used similar arguments to defend theItalian contract, and the company itself has used sucharguments to garner congressional support to pay for theground-control equipment.   The Pentagon's decision capped another successful lobbyingeffort by Raytheon, one of the few major defense contractorsthat has avoided layoffs from defense belt-tightening. Thecompany had said that approximately 1,200 of the 6,000workers at its Andover plant could have received pink slipsduring the next few years unless the Italian project wasfunded. Some Andover production lines building Patriotequipment for U.S. air defense needs would have stoppedworking in 1991.   &quot;This helps stabilize our production capabilities as welook forward to future international sales,&quot; said a Raytheonspokesman.   Raytheon plans to license production of the missiles inItaly by an Italian consortium. Without the Army's approvalof funding for the ground equipment, however, the roughly $5billion project in Italy would have collapsed.   The U.S. and Italy signed a memorandum of understandingabout the Patriot systems two years ago, but Italy stillhasn't provided final funding for any of the planned missilepurchases.   The Army said 1984 was the last time it approved such acontract to supply ground-control equipment for U.S.-mademissiles to a foreign country. That contract involved theWest German military.   A person familiar with the Patriot negotiations said partof the Pentagon's decision to pay for the ground equipmentwas based on fears that Raytheon would raise prices for theequipment for Italy purchased by the U.S if Andoverproduction lines had to be closed down and later reopened.   Late last month, the Pentagon rescinded an earlierdecision to cut procurement of Hawk missiles, also made atAndover, saving another 850 Raytheon jobs.   In other contract actions, Rockwell International Corp.received a $10.8 million Air Force contract for B-1Belectronic test equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
