Syntex said that as a result of the ruling against T.J. Roaco Ltd., it would seek &quot;full compensation&quot; for the infringement at a trial ordered by the court on Nov. 6.    Syntex, a health-care company based in Palo Alto, Calif., declined to estimate damages. A company spokesman said the ruling sends &quot;a message that Syntex will vigorously enforce its patent against distributors.&quot;    T.J. Roaco is a drug distribution concern with its headquarters in New York and its principal operations in Toronto. Officials couldn't be reached for comment on the ruling. </TEXT></DOC>
