Mrs. Masloff, 71, known as ``Sophie'' around the city, was CityCouncil president last year when she was appointed to fill thevacancy left by the death of Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri.   With 394 of 402 precincts reporting, Mrs. Masloff had 29,994votes, or 28 percent, to 24,766, or 23 percent for state Rep.Thomas J. Murphy Jr.   The man who had been considered her main challenger, AlleghenyCounty controller Frank Lucchino, trailed with 22,616 votes, or 21percent.   Byrd R. Brown, an attorney who led the local NAACP branch duringthe 1960s, and City Controller Tom Flaherty, who had the localparty endorsement, split the remainder.   ``We're a family and we just had a good talk about the future,''Mrs. Masloff said of the campaign and her opponents. ``We alllearned a lot. ... These are good and serious people and I salutethem.''   Mrs. Masloff's challengers conceded defeat well before midnightTuesday.

The Democratic winner is all but certain to win the Novemberelection. Democrats represent 82 percent of the city's 220,069voters. The Republicans have not elected a mayor since 1933 and noGOP candidates were in the primary.   Mrs. Masloff, who uses the ``Jewish grandmother'' tag as part ofher folksy image, has been a Democratic loyalist for more than 50years.   Lucchino, 50, a lawyer and a longstanding party leader who isserving a third term as county controller, was Mrs. Masloff's mainrival in the polls, although surveys showed his support waning inthe last month.   He had the support of the city's two daily newspapers andreportedly spent more than $1.2 million on his campaign, more thantwice that spent by Mrs. Masloff.   Issues included the contenders' political personalities,economic development and jobs, the city's 3.5 percent wage tax onresidents, a 10 percent amusement tax, crime prevention,neighborhood renewal and gay rights.   Pittsburghers also voted for Democrats seeking nine nominationsto City Council under a new district set-up replacing the currentat-large system.   Black leaders hope the new districts will deliver two blacks tothe Council.</TEXT></DOC>
