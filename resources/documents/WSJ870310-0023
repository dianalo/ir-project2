In its quarterly report to Congress on currency intervention, the New York Fed said it sold Japanese yen to buy $50 million of U.S. currency Jan. 28 in response to the dollar's sharp drop that day. The operation was coordinated &quot;with Japanese monetary authorities,&quot; the bank said.    The bank added that the action was &quot;consistent with&quot; an agreement announced a week earlier between Treasury Secretary James Baker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. That agreement reaffirmed their willingness to cooperate on exchange-rate issues and called the then-prevailing dollar-yen valuation appropriate.    In Jan. 28 trading, the dollar plunged 0.5%, to an intraday low of 150.35 yen from 151.18 the previous day. The dollar recovered to stand at 151.39 yen in late New York trading. </TEXT></DOC>
