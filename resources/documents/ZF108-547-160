How much money are they giving you?andO;Are they doing it with other people?andM;William Y. Tauscher, ComputerLand: I think they're doing it across thereseller channel.andP;  Specifically, we're being led by hardware vendors, notsoftware vendors.andP;  A fair amount of confusion still exists in how thesoftware vendors can participate in all this, and, of course, the vendors areall of our main-line hardware vendors.andM;Dyson: For example?andM;Tauscher.andP;  IBM, Apple, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Epson, Okidata.andM;Dyson: And are they all doing this the same way?andP;  You're sending them allreceipts, or how does it work?andM;Tauscher: Well, we don't actually send them payroll stubs and receipts, butwe certainly have an open-book audit function that we encourage.andP;  Without it,you have the opportunity for the dollars to be used in street margin asopposed to infrastructure support.andP;  So, it's joint budgeting and then anaudit process.andM;Dyson: And how much? What number of points does it typically come to?andM;Tauscher: Well, in our case, if you do the simple arithmetic, you're talkingabout an organization in the United States that will do a little over $2billion this year.andP;  So, we're talking about something in the neighborhood ofa couple of points.andP;  And, if you study the overall SGandamp;A structure, andexclude pure marketing-development things - non-technical infrastructure - Ibelieve there's a I to 2 percent increase in SGandamp;A that we have to layer in.andO;These arc training and systems integration costs, if you will, to help usface this problem of complexity and the customer satisfaction that goes withit.andM;I think we can get the customer to pay for part of it.andP;  As I said before, inthe end, he pays for all of it.andP;  The normal pricing then will come off that.andO;Dyson: Now, would you think you might sell more than 5 percent of yourrevenues in software if you came to such an agreement with Lotus, forexample? Tauscher.andP;  Well, I think we have a couple of problems to lick in thesoftware area in particular.andP;  The first is that there is a retail businessleft for software.andP;  We've pretty well moved away from it as many otherresellers have; now we've got to decide whether we want to return to it.andM;Second, although I know Businessland and Corporate Software are successfulthere, today, we really are not providing an organized catalogue,telemarketing, direct-fulfillment software function.andP;  We're going to do thatover the coming year, and that alone, could add  100 million to our softwaresales without a big leap of faith.andM;There's no question of the challenge.andP;  We can't just do this on hardware andhardware networks; we've got to take the next step.andP;  Today, by and large, wedon't have those kinds of arrangements working with the Lotuses and others.andM;So, I think the answer is  yes,&quot; but we've both got some work to do to figureout how to structure it.andP;  It's a lot easier when you're starting from such avolume base as we are with the hardware manufacturers.andM;Dyson: Would you like them to sell Notes for you, Jim?andM;Tauscher: I don't think I'm sure we can.andM;Jim Manzi, Lotus Development: I agree with everything Bill just said.andM;[Laughter]andM;Including everything he said in his talk.andP;  Our position is that we aremutually exploring with resellers and other participants how we ought tobring products like Notes to the market, and trying to define an appropriaterole for various distributors to help over a period of time.andP;  We started withthe direct sales force largely because that's what that product is going torequire and because there is no real place to go that we were comfortablewith in launching that product.andM;There's a big victory in establishing that product.andP;  From today we've beenhaving conversations with different channel participants about how to broadenand leverage distribution.andP;  With Notes, there was no opportunity to do thatat the time we were ready to launch it, which was last quarter.andP;  But we wouldbe crazy if we didn't look for opportunities to involve other participantsand resellers to get the advantages of leveraged distribution on that productand other products.andP;  So those processes are under way and have been for sometime.andM;Dyson: Thanks.andP;  Mike Quinlan is from IBM, and used to run the NationalAccounts Division there.andP;  He's now in the PS/2 fine of business, and you'regoing to hear him give a talk tomorrow.andP;  Mike, what do you think of thisnotion of supporting your vendors directly to do something in particular?andM;Michael Quinlan, IBM.- Well, Esther, I pretty much agree with a lot of whatBill said.andP;  I was the president of marketing for IBM at that time, Bill, whenwe weren't exactly viewed as business partners.andP;  I'm the guy that used to dothose reviews when the sale didn't come from the sales force.andM;I concluded about three to five years ago that I couldn't possibly cover theopportunity with the sales force I had.andP;  Over time, we've come to dependtremendously upon our dealers.andP;  I view your systems engineers as every bit asimportant to my business as the IBM systems engineers.andP;  Having said that, Icare a great deal about the profitability of a dealer; how could I not?andM;The distribution channel is clearly our preferred method of distribution.andP;  SoI do sense an obligation to share in ensuring they have a reasonableprofitability story to tell their shareholders.andP;  We have to provide some seedmoney as we create infrastructure which, sure, ultimately becomes your burdento operate, but there is a seeding process to get started.andM;Long term, those things will aid dealers who add value in segmented markets.andO;You really have to pick your spots.andP;  Adding value alone is important and doesincrease some cost, but the payoff is when that added value is delivered.andM;Dyson: ComputerLand is not exactly known as a vertical marketer.andP;  Does thatmean you're not going to go after the broad-scale dealers or what?andM;Quinlan: No, on the contrary.andP;  As Bill suggested, our National DistributionDivision literally sits down with each of our dealers.andP;  We try to understandwhat their business plan is; we are literally developing plans together.andO;Every dealer has a different set of goals and ambitions; they're really notquite the same, as you pointed out in your presentation.andP;  And so, as eachdealer develops his business plan and its distinguishing characteristics, wethen try to find out how we might participate.andP;  It's a very individualnegotiation, dealership by dealership.andM;Dyson: And are the amounts different from dealer to dealer?andM;[Laughter]andM;Quinlan: I'd say it this way: If every dealer came to the table with the sameprecise opportunity, there'd be absolutely no difference in funding, none.andO;We obviously have different propositions from different dealerships, and wereact accordingly.andP;  That's about the extent of the comment I'll make on it.andM;Dyson: Thank you.andP;  Enzo, are you looking at ComputerLand as a way to senNetFRAME, and why or why not?andM;Enzo Torresi, NetFRAME: Well, I'm looking at this process of graduation frompcs to systems in everybody's channel.andP;  Clearly now, we will gear the serviceto products.andP;  I have some clear thoughts: Two years ago at Businessland, whenwe looked at strategy - as Bill, in his slides, just showed us ComputerLanddid - we segmented internally into commodity products, then service,networking.andP;  But, in the eyes of our customers, we did not do a good job atthis.andM;And the other problem which Mike was addressing, is that if you look at it asa percentage of sales, you look at a percentage of sales of everything.andP;  So,we identify a reseller as an entity that normally adds value as far as time,price and utility.andP;  But it doesn't add value as far as systems engineeringgoes.andM;I think the solution is aggressive segmentation and description of yourbusiness.andP;  If you do have a system-engineering function, Please identify thatand account for it.andP;  It's an internal tool for profit and loss so we canidentify these funds for training, for instance, in a visible and negotiablemanner with our vendors.andP;  Businessland started an advanced systems divisioneven before my departure, but we did not advertise or market it properly.andO;But, I think the key is also for the vendors - now I'm a vendor as NetFRAME -to start segmenting their channels and and understand those who really do thejob and those who do not.andP;  I learned today ComputerLand has 400 systemsengineers.andP;  I didn't know that.andM;If that is true, and if I could have a discussion with ComputerLand thattells me exactly what they do, how much they spend, if they have identifiedan internal Pandamp;L statement that is credible, then I would be willing to directtraining dollars to them.andM;So, the answer to your question is &quot;of course.&quot; The same is true for VARs;the same is true for a Businessland.andP;  The company I know the best - I knowexactly how they do it; probably that's why I am biased - was Businessland,and Businessland has currently a limited distribution agreement withNetFRAME.andP;  The reason is that I trust, I know what's happening.andP;  I know howmany SEs they have, I know how many millions of dollars they spend intraining, and I'm willing to work with them and partner with them.andM;If we keep it a secret, of how we are structuring to go into connectivity,systems engineering, obviously nothing is going to happen.andP;  Even worse, withvendors looking at resellers as being just one business - commodity,mainstream, hardware - it becomes practically impossible not to do reallystrange things ...andP;  lake having difficulty answering the question you justasked IBM.andM;That should not be the case.andP;  IBM should have an instant answer and say, &quot;Ifsystems engineering is 25 percent of your business, we'll contribute 15percent to your training expenses every month.&quot; We should drive in thatdirection.andP;  I think we will be there in probably a year or two, but we're notthere today.andM;Dyson: But don't you want some way to assess whether the 25 percent theyspend on engineering is worth it?andM;Torresi: Absolutely.andP;  If I'm dealing with a company that has segmentedinternal systems engineering into a Pandamp;L division...andP;  because you're notdealing with small businesses.andP;  If you take a $1.4-billion business likeBusinessland, systems engineering is a big, big chunk of that, but it's notvisible.andP;  The answer to your question: Today it's done only on volume, on thehardware side.andM;Dyson: It sort of makes me wonder whether Jim is right and we shouldn't allgo he Arthur Andersen and let people buy the hardware from warehouses.andM;Torresi: Well, I strongly disagree with that.andP;  You know the customer isdisillusioned and, as we move into more complexity, the customers arefundamentally unhappy with the level of services they are getting.andP;  But we asvendors are also being unrealistic.andP;  You know, we're dealing today withsystems engineering.andP;  A ComputerLand or Businessland has to be comfortablewith themselves, where possibly this includes a system from Banyan and UNIX.andM;That kind of comfort is impossible even for a good computer scientist.andP;  Atthe same time we're saying, you - ComputerLand and Businessland with threepoints of return to the bottom line - you have to fund the training and thistype of infrastructure.andP;  There is no way that can happen.andP;  So the customer isdisillusioned.andM;But I don't think the customer is unwilling to pay, if we could in factprovide them with the right level of support and systems engineering.andP;  Thecustomers tell me so every day, and I see a lot of large accounts that areready to pay if the service comes close to expectations.andP;  So, I don't thinkthe approach of saying, &quot;We give up, because we can only do it directly,&quot; isright.andM;I think we have to look at the issue of proliferation of standards verycarefully.andP;  Resellers have to be a little stronger at saying, &quot;This is auseful, necessary new standard, it really does add value to the function oftechnology value ...andP;  Or it doesn't.&quot; And, if it doesn't, don't sen it !andO;And, if we are just proliferating standards beyond what's comprehensible toregular customers and resellers, that's another big issue I think would beworth investigating.andM;Dyson: Wannabe standards? Not real standards, but wannabe standards?andM;Torresi: Well, I think again there are unnecessary standards.andP;  If thestandard only adds 5, 10 percent to the value proposition that Jim wastalking about, then it isn't worth it.andP;  The support cost to bring it tomarket is so high that it's probably not going to happen.andM;Dyson: So Lotus is going to have to do it itself?andM;Torresi: I don't know whether their standard sets a separate function in thevalue proposition.andP;  If it does, then he should try with the reseller; if itdoesn't they should try both ways.andP;  In any case, I believe that there isalways a period after you launch a product, particularly a very new,powerful, innovative product, where you can sell direct.andP;  I can generallyclose the first 100 accounts in the United States; there is no question aboutit.andP;  Does that buy me a lot of power in the long term? I don't know.andP;  I'm notbeing critical, you know.andP;  I think any company should do what they think isfair at that point in their lives.andM;Dyson: Jim, do you have a response, or should I call on Seymour?andM;Manzi: My only response is that we've done an exceedingly dangerous -thin-,which is to mix a discussion of standards with one dealer margins anddistribution, which are two topics that could each consume the entireconference.andM;[Laughter]andM;Our view is just to clarify.andP;  We, are looking and will look for leverageddistribution opportunities where we can work with people, as they develop andas we develop.andP;  We have to ask ourselves, both on the vendor side and on thechannel side, about the capacity to do so.andP;  There arc two costs of doingbusiness: There's the cost of doing existing business, the standalonecomputing model, and there is the cost of doing new business.andP;  What channelparticipants have the margin structure or the capital structure or the desireto go into a new class of computing as a business?andM;With an attendant long fist of support and service opportunities associatedwith it, that's what's up for grabs, that's what's undefined.andP;  I don't thinkit's necessarilly going to come out of the existing channel.andP;  I think there'sgoing to be a reshaping of forces at work here.andM;Dyson: Where from?andM;Manzi: There is a gigantic opportunity.andP;  Everybody here has said customersare willing to pay.andP;  If the quality is good, customers will sign up for it;they just need to know who to call so they know where to send their checks.andM;But really, nobody is stepping into that space to provide those services.andP;  Weare doing it with Notes; this year, we are putting specialized systemsengineers into place to cover our mainframe, VAX, and UNIX offerings.andP;  Forus, that's somewhere between $80,000 and $1 10,000 per person to put thosepeople in the field, even when, as in some of those instances, we are sellingthose products through distribution.andM;So, we are going to do it; other people will do it.andP;  If the opportunity's bigenough, organizations that do nothing else but this are going to spring up.andM;Dyson: Like a new company called Evernet?andM;Manzi: There are firms all over, there are boutiques all over the countrydoing this sort of thing.andM;Dyson: The problem is they're boutiques, and the customers don't know how tofind them.andM;Manzi: They're doing fine.andP;  They're growing, they're doubling every year.andO;Maybe they'll continue to double, and maybe some existing participants willget into that business.andM;Dyson: Sy Merrin?andM;Seymour Merrin, Merrin Information Services: I have so many questions, it'sunbelievable.andM;Dyson: Start with one.andM;[Laughter]andM;Merrin: All I can do is one that I'd like to ask Bill, but before I ask aquestion ...andP;  from my perspective, which is looking at the distributionchannel, I think you've done an absolutely favulous job over the last coupleof years, Bill.andM;Tauscher: Thank you.andM;Merrin: Now I have a real nasty question for you.andM;[Laughter]andM;We talk about over distribution and low margins and an that, and I certainlyconcur with your numbers.andP;  Everyone I know of in the dealer distributionchannel has recognized precisely the same opportunities you have.andP;  Networkingis clearly where the value-added dollars are going to come in.andM;If everybody goes after this same opportunity in the same way, how the heckis ComputerLand or anyone else going to maintain margins? What if we haveeverybody going after the same groupware customers with the same vigor?andM;Tauscher.andP;  The simple answer to that is that everybody won't and can't.andP;  Ifyou look at a simple structure of how you put systems engineers in place, youcan afford a certain level of them and certain amount of training on the roadwith your local operation.andP;  You can allocate a certain amount in the region,a certain amount in the corporation and then you obviously need some way tofink back to the original source or manufacturer with his systems engineersor his technical people.andM;Well, there are certainly critical-mass issues in doing that across theboard.andP;  Enzo asked how can you expect us to support LAN Manager and NetWareand Banyan and various other kinds of things.andP;  Well, we can and we do, but wedo it with segmentation and with hierarchical levels of support.andM;And, we have to do it with a different structure in the way our margin works.andO;But, it isn't for everybody.andP;  Clearly, segmentation will continue in themarketplace.andP;  To a degree, some people win specialize in different kinds ofcustomers.andP;  To a degree, it will reflect how technical people are - somepeople moving into UNIX or workstations, some people moving into otherspecialties.andP;  You especially will see it in some of the smaller entities; thebigger entities will do it within themselves.andM;I don't think it's anything different from the kind of normal maturation yousee in any industry, but I also think we'll have substantially fewer players.andM;Dyson: Vendors or resellers or both?andM;Tauscher: Probably both, but I'm best qualified to comment on the resellers.andM;Dyson: What about just making these products easier to install? I mean doinga Macintosh of networking or something?andM;Tauscher.andP;  There is no question that a key to the cost structure of thisbusiness is going to be the ability for the manufacturers or publishers to doexactly that.andP;  Obviously, it's more and more difficult to do that, the morecomplex the products are.andM;It's just a challenge of technology.andP;  But, if you want a mass distributedproduct, you've got to solve that problem.andP;  To the degree that you don't,your ability to get mass distribution, no matter how good a job we do intraining, will be limited.andM;Dyson: Enzo, how long does it take to set up a NetFRAME?andM;Torresi: About four and a half hours of somebody who really, really knowsnetworks very well to get the installation up and running.andP;  When you haveseveral tens of users, it can take you up to three, four days.andM;Dyson: And can't you do something automated in there?andM;Torresi: Manufacturers have to work with creative new solutions.andP;  You neednew software, with ease of everything, client/server, and it must be easy toinstall, easy to maintain.andP;  There's an issue of pre-sale, sale and post-sale.andO;We're doing a good job of adding value in that area.andP;  But, we cannot be justa hardware company; we have to add value in the software side which makes ourRandamp;D much more expensive.andM;Clearly, the complexity is rising faster than the ease of use.andP;  There aresubstantial differences between the three or four primary operating systems;that is a lot of stuff for any SE today, particularly because even the moststable environments like Novell NetWare and OS/2, even the most stable ones,come out with new releases every four or six months.andM;And, we have to bring literally all the SEs back into San Jose in the case ofBusinessland - I'm wearing my Businessland hat sometimes and the NetFRAME hatother times - for training every quarter.andP;  That is an awfully expensiveproposition.andM;Quinlan: Just one comment on complexity.andP;  I don't deny that the wholeindustry still has an awful lot to do.andP;  The customers I call on have anothercomplexity issue every bit as tough as the one we're talking about: It turnsout their businesses are changing.andM;You think about what happened to a number of key industries withderegulation; just think about what's going on in banking and brokerage.andP;  Theso-called SE investment we're making, which started off beingproduct-oriented because that's our current problem, over time will in factbe diminished in the eyes of the customer.andP;  It will lose its added value aswe solve that problem.andP;  What will distinguish us long-term are those SEs whoknow banking, who know airlines, who know the businesses we caR on.andM;You have to get the first problem out of the way before the second becomesthe issue, but, in my judgment, that is where we should be thinking aboutseeding infrastructure.andP;  That's what the customers I see want, as well as thethings that were discussed by the panel.andM;Dyson: Sheldon Laube, could you go up to the mike? He's the guy who boughtthose famous 10,000 copies of Notes.andP;  I'd like to hear from him how much ofthe effort of installing Notes had to do with system-level, Notes-specificissues, and how much had to do with business problems and the kind of thingthat could not have been standardized?andM;Sheldon J. Laube, Price Waterhouse: It's actuary pretty easy to installNotes; they did a nice job of making it reasonably simple for normal peopleto do that.andP;  The real issues that we ran into are more infrastructure issuesof how to display things, how to train people, things like that.andM;But I would like to agree with what Mike just said.andP;  The pc industry islooking at support as if it's this generic issue, that we should have SEs whocan be all-singing, all-dancing, all-knowing.andM;That's not going to work in the future.andP;  You're going to have to startspecializing in solving customer problems.andP;  What we want as an organization,and we're quite willing to pay for, is not an SE who knows OS/2, UNIX, DOS,Banyan and Novell, but one who knows specifically how to help us, as anaccounting firm, solve our problems using Lotus Notes.andP;  A lot of what I hearfrom the few actual customers in this room as opposed to the industry side -is that we need SEs who can focus on solving client problems and who organizetheir software on the industries themselves.andM;They have to understand our business and help us solve our business problemsas opposed to understanding the underlying technology.andP;  Sooner or later, thegap between ease of use and the technology will close, because that's just atechnological issue.andP;  But the gap between the SEs and understanding mybusiness doesn't seem to he addressed very much.andP;  Dyson: I was going to askyou whether you cared if the card said Lotus or ComputerLand or ArthurAndersen.andP;  Then, I realized that you're supposed to he experts yourselves inthis stuff.andM;Laube: I certainly care a lot if it says Arthur Andersen.andM;[Laughter]andM;We certainly don't claim to be experts in everything.andP;  As an organization, wefocus on where we can add value for our clients and that means focusing onspecific areas of expertise.andP;  We don't expect either ourselves to be expertseverywhere or a single vendor to be expert everywhere, and we would neverimagine saying that ComputerLand can solve aU of our needs.andM;Dyson: But what about Lotus?andM;Laube: Lotus certainly doesn't ...andP;  We wouldn't expect Lotus, Microsoft orany of the other outlets to be able to solve all of our needs.andM;Dyson: So you're not only multi-vendor, you're also multi-supporter?andM;Laube: Oh, absolutely.andP;  It's too volatile a business, too many creativepeople everywhere in the industry to try to say that Lotus will be the singlesource of all possible technological solutions to as big an organization asours.andM;Barry F Berkov, CompuServe: At CompuServe, we obviously believe thatelectronic support is one of the answers, and I'm surprised that we haven'theard anything about that.andP;  I was wondering how the panel feels aboutelectronic support as one of the answers, where not only do the vendorsparticipate in supporting the end-users, but also the end-users start tosupport themselves.andM;Tauscher.andP;  We were terribly remiss in not speaking to that.andP;  It's the onlysolution to get the ultimate leverage for what we're trying to do.andP;  Just togive you some sort of examples and maybe paint a picture of where we'retrying to go, we are hooking all of our outlets up to a satellite TV network.andO;We require two hours a week of what I call army basic training for all ourpeople in the field.andM;We're working on several products using both CD-ROM-type technology and largecentralized databases.andP;  We're doing this to figure out ways to get easieraccess to both technical and product data, and extend it not only to the SEin the field, but also to customers.andP;  That's essential to get away fromprinted manuals and other means that are clearly out of date and inefficient.andO;We think a product like Notes has some fascinating possibilities to finkcustomer, salespeople, resellers, corporate mechanics, manufacturers andvendors.andM;Ultimately, our ability to solve that efficiently, whether it be the trainingjob, the communication job, the distribution of information job, has got tobe done electronically.andP;  Dyson: Give us a card, Jim? Manzi: Well, our Notesinvoicing officer is here in the second row, he'll be -  [Laughter]andM;Dyson: Do any vendors or customers care to testify on direct, customer,electronic bulletin-board-style support? Has anybody tried it and found it'swonderful?andM;Melody Robidoux, Artisoft: We sell a local-area network which is one of thoseeasy-to-install products that really leads the market for networking.andP;  Wehave a full-time bulletin board electronic-support system in the tech-supportdepartment, and it has worked wonderfully direct to the end-user.andP;  Ourresellers also use it.andP;  It probably saves 25 percent of our tech-supportcalls.andM;Dyson: And the customers like it?andM;Robidoux: The customers love it and it also gets a dialogue going between theother BBS operators around the country.andP;  Also, it's been great for sales,because other sysops have looked at the product and the testimonials on theproduct and are using it in their particular business applications.andM;Dyson: And is it used for reporting bugs or doing marketing research andstuff like that?andM;Robidoux: We don't use it for any marketing research right now, although it'ssomething that we could look at.andP;  It's very good for bug reports and forusers sharing solutions to particular application problems.andM;Torresi: Because we now know that it works, we're bundling a package ofcc:Mail with every server that we sell.andP;  A customer can log in automaticallyinto either our electronic mail system or the Businessland electronic madsystem, which, by the way, are interconnected.andP;  We think that's the minimumyou should do.andM;As you know also, on the technology side, we have this feature calledserver-activated maintenance, that looked so incredible last year when wewere talking about it.andP;  This year it works: You can try it.andM;[LaughterlandM;It's really wonderful.andP;  The server does call you, does call 150 phone numbersof people who get paged.andP;  You see the number of the server caring you, andyou can call up, and the server will tell you in plain English what's goingon and what's failing.andP;  Obviously, we hope to make all these SEs intoMaytag-type servicemen.andM;[Laughter]andM;There is a lot of technology for electronic support features that can and doalleviate the problem.andP;  But I'd like to say one word about this issue withPrice Waterhouse [Laube's comment].andP;  We have to take it a step at a time: SEsfirst have to be horizontally proficient - and I don't think they are todayin order to become vertically proficient in addressing particular businessesand particular industry segments.andM;That's very, very hard to do.andP;  It's a second step, and it's going to takemany more years.andP;  It's going to take two or three years horizontally and it'sgoing to take more vertically.andM;Morton Rosenthal, Corporate Software: Yes, in terms of electronic support,our strategy has always been to he proactive with helping our customers tosupport themselves and, thereby, be more efficient.andP;  We have been testing aservice with our customers, with our largest accounts.andP;  It collects all ofour technical information and a number of our vendors' technical information- drivers, patch disks, et cetera - and essentially builds the informationcenter's workstation.andP;  So, they have resources available to them right therefor which otherwise they would have to pick up the phone.andM;Over time, we expect to add a connection on a more on-line basis a la Noteswith the customer; we use Notes internally extensively.andP;  We'll extend it tothe end-user over time, but that's probably several years down the road.andM;Dyson: And how do you organize all that information? How do I find out theparticulars?andM;Rosenthal.andP;  I refer to Jim's equation of software plus data equalsinformation or whatever it was, or equals value? It's essentiallyCD-ROM-based.andM;Dyson: So you do text search?andM;Rosenthal: It's a combination of things.andP;  Logically, it's thinking in termsof how the customers would use it if they're doing an evaluation Ofdatabases; there's a section that will guide you through evaluations.andM;Dyson: Let me put in a plug here for Answer Computer and Lysis with SupportInformation System as two models of text servers that can be used for thatpurpose.andP;  Chauncey Bell quickly and then Amy Wohl.andM;Chauncey Bell, Action Technologies: Yes, I just wanted to mention there's aproduct called MHS - which our company provides and which is shipped withNetWare at this point - that over a hundred vendors and large Fortune 500 MISdepartments are developing the exact kind of service that you're talkingabout using.andP;  They're building aU kinds of applications on top of MHS usingthat as a transport to other media and as a way of handling diverseconversations with all kinds of suppliers ...andM;Dyson: Thank you, that's Action Technologies.andM;Amy Wohl, Wohl Associates: I'm a little surprised - given all we now knowabout the failure of central planning as a way of telling us what customerswould like to buy, and the resurgence of faith in free markets and capitalistpricing systems - that Mr. Tauscher didn't simply decide to try to sellservice and support to his customers rather than try to get vendors to fundit.andP;  In the office equipment industry, the most profitable part of businessis selling service and support.andP;  Did you consider trying simply to make thatinto a business on your own?andM;Tauscher: If I implied that we weren't, I was inarticulate and incorrect.andP;  Wevery much have done that: The service and maintenance part of our businesshas become a separate Pandamp;L.andP;  We've become religious about selling it as partof all that we do, with all of our  salespeople trained and rewarded to dothat.andP;  We've become religious about charging for it, which we didn't do, andreligious about putting in systems and various other capabilities to make ita real business.andM;Wohl: And the support business?andM;Tauscher: In the support or systems engineering business, it's the exact samephenomenon with about an 18-month drag on when we started and where we are inthe process.andM;In that instance also, we can get the customers to pay for a good deal of it.andO;Part of the problem you have is the seeding problem.andP;  It's especially true insystems engineering, as the product world gets more complex, even more thanin the service business where we already have pretty good critical mass andare moving along.andM;As to profitability, I gave some statistics about gross and net.andP;  Today, overhalf our profitability on the average is out of the service businesses; bythe end of next year I believe it will be nearer two-thirds.andP;  It's the key torestoring our profitability.andP;  We will not change the profitability on ourproduct business because we are at the level that product-distributionbusinesses run at.andM;Dyson: Okay, Ronan McGrath, another customer.andM;Ronan D. McGrath, Canadian National Railways: My question is for Jim Manzi.andO;From our perspective, we have never found that the added value from thedealer channel in software was substantial.andP;  We use our dealers to installand maintain hardware.andP;  When we're looking at a development curve that may be18 months, two years, a lot of the technology that's going to be delivered atthe end of that time needs direct support from the vendor rather than thedealer.andM;Do you see the software industry at the vendor level delivering any kind ofservice for a charge at the higher end, rather than having a third party asan intermediary in the process? That's really where we need the support.andM;Manzi: The answer is, absolutely.andP;  Let me tell you specifically what we aredoing.andM;In our sales organization, which is pre-sales and some level of post-salessupport, all of the incremental hiring this year is dedicated SEs.andP;  There areSEs associated with Notes, SEs associated with 1-2-3, many for IBM mainframesand for our VAX product fine, for a UNIX product line and so on.andP;  Thosepeople are part of the selling process.andP;  They'll work with customers so thatan increment of support will come, in some sense, for free - up to a point.andM;At the same time we've been experimenting on the horizontal approach to it.andO;We are picking two or three vertical markets or industry-specific areas wherewe are going to go after specific service opportunities for the betterintegration of our products and our tools into large organizations.andM;That is a fee-based business that we're going to be selling on a contractbasis, starting at the end of this quarter or thereabouts.andP;  We've beentalking to, oh, four or five, six customers on the subject now.andP;  We have acouple of pilots in the works, so we've been investigating this for sometime.andM;Finally, we've got a whole big effort trying to improve what we're doing forend-user support - for instance, seven-days-a-week, 24-hours-a-day end-usersupport, which started in the middle of last year, and aH sorts of things toimprove those systems.andP;  We've just increased by 60 percent the number ofpeople doing end-user support, from a very big number to an even biggernumber.andM;Laube: I just wanted to comment on what Enzo said and a trend I see in theindustry.andP;  That is the perception on the part of the industry that allclients have all possible software and networking in their organization andare looking for a lot of horizontal support.andM;In our organization and some of my colleagues in other large organizations...andP;  part of our goal is to set some unique infrastructure and architecturestandards.andP;  We want to say, for example, Novell is our networking standard.andM;The fact that your SE also knows Banyan is really of no value.andP;  I hear a lotof vendors say, &quot;Our goal is to support everybody with everything.&quot; All ofthat horizontal training and horizontal SEs, I wonder how those really fit...andP;  Are we unique in trying to set these standards if everybody else haseverything, or is there some discontent?andM;Torresi: You inevitably have a Price Waterhouse-centric view of the world andNovell happens to have a NetWare-centric view of the world and so does BillGates with OS/2.andP;  I think we're walking a really fine line here ofunderstanding who's really centric on all of this.andM;Dyson: Well, the customer pays, and the customer is centered on what he'sgot.andM;Torresi: But the customers are all different.andP;  I can find as passionateadopters of Banyan, as I can passionate adopters of NetWare, and they dobusiness with you only if you can provide those services.andP;  We have very, verylarge accounts that have made it a condition for you to do business with themin generic pcs that you support them in this off-the-wall, real strangestandard that they have established.andM;And, if you are a reseller and you are aggressive and you are probablygreedy, what do you do? The way that I like to say it is that we aremulti-vendor to a point.andP;  There has to be a point where you as a resellerhave to say, &quot;These are the two or three standards that horizontally I'mgoing to support and I cannot go beyond.&quot; Because, if you stretch yourselftoo much and then delude yourself too much, you're not going to do a goodjob.andM;Then we get to a point of having to cross those lines and, as I was sayingbefore, that's why the issue of standards is so critical.andP;  You have to findyour limit and stay within that limit, and still be a good provider ofoverall service to companies with different strategies.andM;Dyson: The reason people want standards nine times out of ten is they can getsupport for them.andP;  The value of a product is in part the ease with which youcan get the support for it.andP;  That's the value of a standard in many cases,aside from connectivity and stuff like that.andM;Torresi: Large accounts are going to want to develop some of their tools andsystems internally, using horizontal tools, but they're going to do it almostin a customized fashion in the  90s.andP;  And, for a &quot;reseller&quot; to support themin that effort, it is even harder.andP;  That's a joint challenge for vendors andresellers.andM;Gianluca Rattazzi, Parallan Computer: One of the things Bill Tauscher talkedabout during his presentation was application servers, especially formission-critical applications.andP;  Application servers are of importance toresellers, because they add the corollary to one of the laws Jim Manzi showed- the one where the price of storage will go down to 11 cents per megabyte.andO;The corollary is that the price for storage in a server will be at leastthree times as high.andM;Software is becoming much more an issue than hardware, so support is becomingmuch more important, both service and sales.andP;  If you look at this new classof machines like NetFRAME and others, the basic machines are offering thenetwork operating systems, databases, some of the sophisticated applicationslike Notes ...andP;  I'm wondering, are the manufacturers helping the resellerchannel by offering machines with multiple operating systems, multiplenetwork operating systems, multiple databases?andM;I mean, can a reseller like ComputerLand support all the different softwareconfigurations?andM;Tauscher: Yeah.andP;  We're making this a little bit complex by the way we'reusing some terms here.andP;  Vertical to me applies to different types ofindustries and has nothing to do with focusing on different products.andO;Horizontal is saying that we're going after all customers with a givenproduct.andP;  But horizontal does not imply that we're going to have thiscomputer scientist that Enzo talked about or 400 of them that can take fouroperating systems and six networking capabilities and talk intelligentlyabout all of them to a sophisticated customer.andP;  It's an impossibility.andM;What it does imply is that we as a reseller are going to select a certainbandwidth of how many we are going to support, and then, within that, we'regoing to develop some individual expertise.andP;  There's no question that almostall customers, big and little, end up focusing on a given standard ortechnology solution.andP;  They don't really care about some genius who can talkabout four and five standards and platforms; they want to get the fellow thatcan deal with their particular focused solution.andM;So our challenge becomes first to decide our bandwidth in terms of number ofproducts or platforms, and then to develop specific support capability onthose different platforms.andM;Robert F. Berland, IBM.andP;  I have a blind study of the CEOs of a number ofsoftware vendors who are in this room, of the priority things that theyneeded help with.andP;  As you might expect, everyone wanted help with sales.andM;[Laughter]andM;We were interested in whether our infrastructure, our network, our databaseset cetera, could provide a vehicle for you people to support your endcustomers an over the world.andP;  Because we have that infrastructure; I'mworking on that problem now.andM;I didn't get a lot of high-level interest, because I don't think many of youare focused enough on how critical that support is to that end-user.andP;  Ifyou're interested in that area, I'd be delighted to talk to some people whileI'm here because we have to make some decisions imminently.andM;Dyson: I think part of the problem, Bob, is what Bill Tauscher just said: Youhave this large organization, but can you train a single individual in eachplace to support each of the multitude of products that might be involved insuch an arrangement?andM;Berland: Well, the vendors have to train people.andP;  Can the vendors help himsupport his end-user?andM;Dyson: I don't know.andP;  That's the problem.andM;Susan Miller, SoftView: In support of what Bill was saying earlier, becausethere seems to be some confusion between support and product introduction, Ibelieve that as a manufacturer it's in your best interests to distribute theinformation through the channel using ComputerLand-type resellers.andP;  Indistributing that information, particularly for technological products, youneed SEs, and to fund the SEs in the initial stages is truly productintroduction cost.andP;  You can compute that in your price and pass it throughthe channel.andP;  As we evolve, we'll be able then to cycle those costs throughour established SEs in the channel.andM;But, I don't want to see this get confused with support costs which, yes, wecan charge the customer for.andP;  You cannot charge the customer for introducinga product he knows nothing of.andP;  The ultimate way you charge the customer forthat is to put it in your price and hopefully get broad distribution quicklyenough to recover your Randamp;D and product introduction costs.andM;Henry Heilesen, Folio Corporation: These end-users end up having to learn newsystems with help from each of the different vendors.andP;  Right now, we have asearch engine on Novell's NetWare.andP;  There must be 250,000 servers that haveour help utility sitting there that other vendors could also use as a vehiclefor support information just by putting it in that format.andP;  But I think249,500 don't know it.andP;  How do you help that end-user use a common helpfacility?andM;Torresi: I think Folio's great stuff, and we're adopting it by the way.andM;Dyson: Great, maybe we can finally automate ourselves out of business.andM;Chris Veal, Ernst andamp; Young.andP;  We've heard a lot about,  Should it behorizontal? Should it be vertical? Should it be subsidized? Should it not?andO;Should it he segmented? Should it not?&quot; I think people are losing sight ofone fundamental: Service, above all, is an attitude; it's not a technologysolution.andM;I'd like to know what these people intend to do to instill this attitude intheir systems engineers, whether they call them service, for example, salesengineers, systems engineers ...andP;  Because I can tell you if that attitude isnot there, your outfit will fail miserably.andM;Dyson: Thank you.andM;[Applause]andM;Dyson: Anybody got an answer?andM;Torresi: I did say the key is training, didn't I?andM;Dyson: Yes.andM;Torresi: The systems engineer needs a good combination of sales training,attitude training.andP;  You're right on, but I don't think that's anything new.andO;Everybody in the service business or providing service knows that.andP;  Dyson:You've got to feel it in your gut.andP;  I once saw a grammar checker that had amisspelling in one of their screen shots and when I told them, they didn'tcare.andP;  And I immediately decided I wouldn't ever bother to talk to thiscompany again.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
