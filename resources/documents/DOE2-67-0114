The cathodes in some of these batteries consistof an electroactive material embedded in a matrix of electrolyte to forma flexible film. Typically, the cathode materials are insertion compoundssuch as V/sub 6/O/sub 13/ or TiS/sub 2/ and the electrolytes are combinationsof poly(ethyleneoxide), PEO and lithium salts such as lithium trifluoromethanesulphonate,LiCF/sub 3/SO/sub 3/. The aim of this work was to gain an increased understandingof the cathode region of solid state batteries of the type Li/PEO/subn/:LiCF/sub 3/SO/sub 3//V/sub 6/O/sub 13/. The cathode region typicallyconsists of 45% by volume of the elecrochemically active material, V/sub6/O/sub 13/ and 5% of acetylene black in particulate form, together with50% of an ionically conducting matrix of PEO/sub 9.0/:LiCF/sub 3/SO/sub3/. It was hoped that a better characterisation of the cathode region,particularly its morphology, would enable important aspects of the problemof loss of battery capacity with usage to be effectively addressed. Resultsare reported of SEM/EDX, polarising microscopy and complex impedanceconductivity studies of the influence of morphology on the behaviourof thin polymeric catholyte films.</TEXT></DOC>
