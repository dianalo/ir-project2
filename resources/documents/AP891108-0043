Another mission for the 625-strong border patrol force will be tointerdict shipments of Nicaraguan and Cuban weapons that the StateDepartment says are being made to leftist rebels in El Salvador.   Sandinista officials are to meet Contra leaders in New YorkThursday and Friday for talks mediated by a joint U.N.-Organizationof American States commission. Honduran officials will sit in asobservers.   The Contras are insisting on reinstatement of the 19-monthcease-fire with the government. President Daniel Ortega of Nicaraguasuspended the unilateral truce last week, citing mounting rebelraids he said were aimed at disrupting national elections set forFeb. 25.   The Contra attacks violate an Aug. 7 agreement by five CentralAmerican presidents under which Ortega promised the free electionsin exchange for the demobilization of the Contras by early December.   The State Department says about 2,000 Contras infiltratedNicaragua in recent weeks, and that now about 4,000 are in Nicaraguaand 10,000 remain in their bases in Honduras.   The United States ceased arming the Contras in February 1988 butthe Bush administration has continued to supply them with non-lethaleaid.   The border patrol force is the first U.N. peacekeeping force tobe deployed in the Western Hemisphere, and U.S. acceptance of itmarks a reverse by Washington.   Earlier this year, then-U.S. ambassador Vernon Walters saidWashington opposed such a force and Jeane Kirkpatrick said when shewas ambassador that U.N. peacekeepers would never have a role inCentral America.   Deployment of the force had been delayed for weeks by the failureof the United States to adopt a clear policy.   A U.S. diplomat, speaking privately, said Ambassador ThomasPickering had won political support for the force, but it tooklonger to persuade Capitol Hill that the $41 million cost for sixmonths was worthwhile.   Other officials said there was a split in the Bush administrationover whether the peacekeepers would interfere with U.S. support forthe Contras camped in Honduras.   Canada, West Germany and Spain will provide the bulk of the U.N.soldiers, pilots and staff for the force, to be called ONUCA afterthe Spanish initials for U.N. Observer Group-Central America.   The force will also contain a Latin American contingent. Colombiaand Venezuela have agreed in principle to provide troops.   ONUCA will be a highly mobile border patrol, equipped with jeeps,helicopters and speedboats.   It will have 260 military observers; 115 crew members for 12helicopters and an airplane; 50 members for a naval unit consistingof speedboats and patrol boats; 14 medical workers; about 104 U.N.staffers for administration; and 82 locally recruited civilians.   Headquarters will be in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.</TEXT></DOC>
