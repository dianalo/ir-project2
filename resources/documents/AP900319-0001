Guy...,' to UPDATE with Hunt requestingdisaster aid for 25 other counties.</NOTE><BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   Flood waters forced people from their homes in Georgia andFlorida on Monday, and snakes swam past evacuated houses inAlabama. But the heat wave that accompanied the deadly Southernfloods was replaced by a snowy blast of winter.   More than 150 National Guard military police officers patrolledthe streets of Elba, Ala., where an earthen levee ruptured Saturdayafter 16 inches of rain pounded the town over two preceeding days.   Water stood window-high on houses, but many of the 2,000residents evacuated from the town began returning to their homes tosalvage belongings.   Insurance adjusters began assessing claims, but officials saidit may take federal and state money to cover the losses ofbusinessmen and residents whose property lay below the levee on theswollen Pea River.   Gov. Guy Hunt requested federal disaster aid for Coffee County,which includes Elba, and 25 of Alabama's other 66 counties. But hesaid he hoped President Bush would act on the Coffee declarationfirst because of the severe destruction in Elba.   Although no one was killed in Elba, at least 11 people losttheir lives because of flooding elsewhere in southern Alabama. Morethan 3,800 people were evacuated from their homes because offlooding along the Alabama, Conecuh, Pea, Choctawhatchee, andChattahoochee rivers.   In Geneva, Ala., near the Florida border, flood waters continuedto rise but officials said the earthen levee there appeared to heholding.   Margaret Mixon, a spokeswoman for the local Emergency ManagementAgency, said there was some seepage through the levee Sunday night,``but we have that all under control now. ... We feel like we'reover the worst part unless we have some bad luck with the levee.''   Throughout southern Alabama, the high waters flushed out snakes,which could be seen swimming through inundated neighborhoods.   Flood waters rose in central Georgia as streams and riversswollen from heavy weekend rains gushed south, forcing more peoplefrom their homes and businesses.   The Ocmulgee River, with a flood stage of 18 feet, reached 29.5feet Monday morning and was nearing a crest of about 30 feet, saidNational Weather Service hydrologist Russell Post.   The river flooded the entrance to Central City Park in Macon andswept across one of the city's main streets.   The Flint River at Montezuma, Ga., was on its way to an expectedcrest of 26 feet Tuesday, which would be its highest since at least1971, Post said. He said the town's 31.5-foot levee was protectingthe city's downtown and neighboring Oglethorpe, but some residentswere being evacuated.   Six people died in flood-related accidents over the weekend inGeorgia.   In the Florida Panhandle, more than 1,200 people were evacuatedas of Monday, including all 630 residents of Caryville, a town onthe Choctawhatchee River, authorities said.   State officials closed a 20-mile stretch of Interstate 10, fromBonifay to DeFuniak Springs, and rerouted traffic during theafternoon because of concern about erosion around supports for thehighway's bridge over the Choctawhatchee.   The heavy rains in the South coincided with summer-like weatheracross the East. But on Monday, the last day of winter, cold rainand snow began spreading south.   ``It's one last gasp from Old Man Winter, who came down out ofCanada,'' said Rich Heller of the Accu-Weather forecasting servicein Nashville, Tenn., where residents awoke to a coating of heavy,wet snow on Monday.   Spring begins Tuesday at 4:19 p.m. EST.</TEXT></DOC>
