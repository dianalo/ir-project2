Speaking on the eve of the semiannual EC-U.S. ministerial meeting, U.S. Ambassador Alfred H. Kingon said it is &quot;not unrealistic&quot; to expect that this week's talks will yield a tentative accord to be completed early next year. &quot;There's a real desire not to let this issue get out of hand,&quot; the ambassador said.    But another U.S. official familiar with the talks said, &quot;We still have a long way to go on some of these issues.&quot;    Airbus is a grouping of Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain. These companies receive government funds to cover large portions of their Airbus development costs.    At least three separate meetings on the Airbus issue are scheduled for today and tomorrow, including a meeting tomorrow between U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and Willy De Clercq, the EC's commissioner for external trade.    The two-year-old dispute involves U.S. claims that the subsidies for Airbus are unfair to the U.S. aircraft builders Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. Mr. Yeutter's office recently estimated that the introduction of Airbus's new A-320 model has cost the U.S. more than 150 commercial-aircraft sales so far. The EC and the governments that support Airbus maintain that U.S. manufacturers are subsidized indirectly through large defense contracts.    Dissatisfied with the progress of talks this year on the subject, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas prepared unfair-trade-practice complaints and threatened to file them with U.S. authorities. But in October, a trade war was averted when the EC and U.S. agreed on &quot;joint principles&quot; for negotiating an accord.    Since October, representatives of the U.S. and the EC have met three times to discuss issues such as transparency of government aid, the distinction between development and production subsidies, recoupment of costs, repayment of state aid, and spending for promotion and sales of aircraft. </TEXT></DOC>
