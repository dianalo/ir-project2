We have also done some work on thephotophysics of the multiphoton ionization process, using argon as thetest system. The molecules chosen for study all have the common propertythat they do not fluoresce from states in the selected energy region,and their absorption spectra for these states is either forbidden orgreatly obscured by the continuous absorption of dissociating states.Resonance ionization spectroscopy is valuable in that it can probe theabsorptions of high lying states and that it discriminates against rapidlydissociating states, allowing the weaker but more stable states to makethemselves known. The molecules for which substantial results have beenobtained during this grant period are metastable nitrogen, iodine, carbonmonochloride, and carbon dioxide. The first and last of these are notchemically stable and are formed by an electric discharge in a supersonicbeam, while the other two, although chemically stable in the ground state,dissociate easily in the excited state and pose a challenge for spectroscopybecause of their diffuse spectra.</TEXT></DOC>
