Still, DEC officialsare confident that by the time the machines are priced and shipped, therewill be plenty of programs to choose from.andM;Companies said to be hard at work on development of SMP applications includeSDRC (Ideas), Matre (Euclid), Schlumberger (Bravo3) and PDA (Patran), DECofficials said last week.andM;DEC is targeting the machine at the scientific, imaging, molecular modelingand fluid dynamics markets.andM;DEC officials indicated that the internally developed CVAX graphics subsystemmay become the heart of a new family of graphics workstations.andP;  For now,however, only the &quot;Firefox&quot; will be available, in two- or four-processorconfiguration--the 3520 and 3540.andM;&quot;This is our fastest VAXstation system ever,&quot; said Dom Lacava, DEC's vicepresident of low-end systems.andM;&quot;It features two or four CMOS VAX CPUs for symmetrical multiprocessing and anew higher-resolution monitor,&quot; Lacava added.andM;The M-bus and extensions seem to offer something for everyone.andP;  In all, thereare 12 bus bar slots available.andP;  Six of the slots are actually on the M-bus:two for Dual MicroVAX CMOS processor/FPU boards, one for the I/O adapter, onefor either 8MB or 16MB memory cards, a fifth left open and a sixth for aQ-bus adapter.andM;The adapter opens up three built-in Q-bus slots for storage and otherperipheral controllers.andM;So far, DEC has certified compatibility with seven supported SCSI devices.andO;The company is offering the RZ-55, a 332MB 5-1/4-inch SCSI drive with the3520 and a 296MB tape drive subsystem as standard.andM;There is also a short bus cable from the M-bus to the three-slottedCVAX-based graphics subsystem.andP;  The graphics subsystem is said to providesmooth shading capability, and t comes in either 8-bit-plane or 24-bit-planeconfigurations.andM;A new 19-inch color monitor is capable of displaying1,280-pixel-by-1,024-line resolution.andP;  The subsystem suports VAXphigs 2.0 anduses a Phigs Extension to X Window System interface to the hardware.andM;All transversal and transformation is performed by the hardware, according toDEC officials.andP;  The subsystem does not support the anti-aliasing technologyfound in the VAXstation 8000.andM;DEC is positioning the VAXstation 3520 and 3540 below the $90,000 VAXstation8000, but it is not clear how it will be positioned against the $60,800VAXstation 3500, a single-processor color workstation.andM;The system will be sold with software licenses for VMS (or Ultrix),DECwindows, DECnet, local area network VAXclusters and DEC Phigs.andP;  It willalso feature a one-year, return-to-DEC warranty, the same warranty featuredwith the DECstation 3100.andM;No information on prices for the 3520 or 3540 was available.andP;  Information onpricing and availabilty will be announced later this quarter, according toDEC's Lacava.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
