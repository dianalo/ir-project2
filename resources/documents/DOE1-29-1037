The Nevada Nuclear Waste Storage Investigations (NNWSI) projectmust determine the location of the boundary of the disturbed zone foruse in these calculations. This paper summarizes results of computeranalyses and laboratory experiments and suggests a preliminary definitionfor the boundary of the disturbed zone for the unsaturated environmentat Yucca Mountain. Although the intent of this paper is to define theboundary of the disturbed zone at the edge of significant changes inintrinsic hydrologic properties, there is no evidence of changes in intrinsichydrologic properties that could significantly change the groundwatertravel time from the repository to the water table. Such a result suggeststhat the disturbed zone at Yucca Mountain is of minimal extent. Becausethe analyses and experiments reviewed here indicate that there are avariety of changes near the waste package and because the results aresubject to uncertainty, the preliminary suggestion for the extent ofthe disturbed zone is a value larger than the results themselves wouldsuggest: the boundary is proposed to be a plane 10 m below the lowerboundary of the waste packages. 88 refs., 12 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
