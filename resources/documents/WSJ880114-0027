Ryzhkov said recent economic reforms in the Soviet Union and improvements in East-West relations, including the agreement to eliminate some nuclear weapons from Europe, should obviate the need for export controls on sensitive technology to the East bloc.    &quot;In this age when great changes are taking place . . . when very complicated issues are being resolved that seemed impossible only several years ago, we retain old concepts such as Cocom requirements. These should be abandoned,&quot; Mr. Ryzhkov said at a news conference on the final full day of an official three-day visit to Stockholm. The Coordinating Council on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, is a Paris-based group that sets technology-export guidelines for Western member nations and Japan.    Sweden is a neutral country and doesn't belong to Cocom. But since early 1986 the Swedish government has prohibited exports to the East bloc that would violate Cocom rules.    Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson said at a separate news conference yesterday that his country's policy ensures that it &quot;won't be used as an intermediary to get around other countries' restrictions.&quot;    Although Mr. Ryzhkov called Sweden's refusal to ship sophisticated technology to the Soviet Union &quot;an obstacle to better bilateral relations,&quot; Mr. Carlsson said Sweden wouldn't be moved by Soviet demands for freer access to Western technology. &quot;We're under pressure from many countries,&quot; Mr. Carlsson said. </TEXT></DOC>
