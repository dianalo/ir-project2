(SpecialIssue Supplement on Software Engineering)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Brown, Rick.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The C programming language's compiler-generated code forprogram-flow control runs too slowly for high-speed real-time orcontrol applications.andP;  C also has no standard interrupt-processingcapabilities.andP;  However, assembly language can generate and executecode faster than compiled C and can process interrupts.andP;  There isa method to combine the two languages that maintains C's clarityyet minimizes its time problems.andP;  Users can include anassembly-language driver which controls a chain of small Cfunctions.andP;  It also speeds up the transfer of control from onefunction to another.andP;  The code for the driver replaces a simpleaddress calculation for a C switch statement and its multipletests to find a specific case.andP;  This technique of combining C andassembly language can speed up a system by 25 to 100 percent.andO;Other details on this technique are presented.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     C Programming LanguageAssembly LanguageReal-Time SystemsExecution TimeCode GenerationType-In ProgramsNew TechniqueProgram Development TechniquesSoftware Design.andO;Feature:   illustrationdiagramprogram.andO;Caption:   A C function implements each part of the control process.andO;(diagram)The assembly-language function driver.
