A review is given ofthe base program, completed in 1984, which included the comparison andevaluation of several popular high-temperature life prediction approachesas applied to continuously cycled isothermal specimen tests. The optionprogram, of which one year is completed, is designed to develop modelswhich can account for complex cycles and loadings, such as thermomechanicalcycling, cumulative damage, multiaxial stress/strain rates, and environmentaleffects.</TEXT></DOC>
