This notice also proposes to prohibit the useof cotton thread as a PFD component, designate specified nylon and polyesterthreads as standard components, and add new performance requirements fornon-standard thread. Industry-wide conversion to the use of non-standardPFD components made of synthetic materials has caused a substantial backlogin Coast Guard review and acceptance of non-standard components. Also,a significant number of failures of non-standard components have been observedin random production testing. The purpose of these rules, as proposed,would be to reduce the time and effort involved to obtain Coast Guard acceptanceof non-standard PFD components, and to reduce the number of failures observedin random testing of these components. The proposed regulations in thisNPRM relating to standard PFD components and to certain non-standard PFDcomponents essentially represent a codification of longstanding proceduresand requirements that are currently applied to those components.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be submitted on or before January 12, 1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>1.

Discussion of the Proposed Regulations</ITAG>Background_Quality Control for Non-standard ComponentsEach of the existing PFD subparts in 46 CFR, Part 160 contains a sectionor sections containing requirements for the materials (generally referredto as components) used in the construction of the PFD concerned. Componentswhich comply exactly with all of the requirements of one of these sectionsare commonly referred to as standard components. Standard components currentlyinclude such items as cotton fabric and webbing, cotton and synthetic threads,and metal closure hardware. Existing regulations in Part 160 require componentmanufacturers to provide affidavits (the content of which is not currentlydefined in the regulations) as certification that the components they providecomply with all applicable requirements, and they require PFD manufacturersto retain these affidavits as records.Quality control requirements for standards components are not specificallydefined in regulation, although in most cases, standard components mustcomply with military or federal specifications which do contain detailedquality control provisions. The quality control requirements in Part 160are geared toward the end product, or PFD, and require periodic visitsto the PFD manufacturing plant by marine inspectors; periodic inspectionof specific PFD components in production is not required. Because conciselydefined standard components were used almost exclusively in PFD manufactureat the time the existing regulations in part 160 became effective, visualinspections of PFD's in production were considered adequate to assure qualitycontrol of both components and the end product.In the ensuing decades, however, many new materials and technologies weredeveloped which demonstrated potential for equivalent or improved performanceat similar or lower cost when properly used. Since the 1970's the CoastGuard has evaluated these materials (such as synthetic fabrics in placeof cotton, and plastic buckles in place of metal closure hardware) on anindividual basis for suitability as PFD components. Components demonstratedto be equivalent in performance to standard components are commonly referredto as ``non-standard components'', and are accepted by the Coast Guardfor use in PFD's as if they were standard components. Non-standard componentsare now in extensive use.Individual performance testing of non-standard components, which was establishedin the 1970's as non-standard components first came into usage, was intendedto control and monitor the quality of materials for which there originallywas little field service history. Because there was little or no practicalexperience with entire generic categories of non-standard components (e.g.,nylon fabrics), each prospective non-standard component had to be evaluatedfor equivalence individually rather than based upon known characteristicsof a large group of similar products.There are currently two methods in use by the Coast Guard for demonstratingequivalence and obtaining acceptance as a non-standard component: the CoastGuard ``letter of acceptance'', and component ``recognition'' by a recognizedlaboratory. The choice of which method to use lies with the component manufacturer.(Currently, Underwriters Laboratories is the only recognized laboratory,and the UL Recognition program is the only accepted component recognitionprogram. Guidelines for acceptance of other laboratories and programs areincluded in these proposed rules. For convenience in this discussion, ``recognition''will be used to refer to any accepted recognized laboratory program ofinitial product testing and subsequent oversight of quality control duringproduction.)To obtain a Coast Guard letter of acceptance for a non-standard component,the component manufacturer submits data directly to the Coast Guard (inthe form of test results, samples, etc.) demonstrating that the componentmeets the appropriate equivalence requirements. The Coast Guard, afterreviewing the application, then issues the letter of acceptance which establishesthe conditions and restrictions under which the component is acceptablefor use in approved PFD's. A Coast Guard letter of acceptance is validfor a period of five years (the same as for Coast Guard approval of PFD'sand other materials and equipment), after which the manufacturer must resubmitperformance data and product specifications as for a new acceptance. Asfor standard components, a condition of each Coast Guard letter of acceptanceis that the component manufacturer must provide an affidavit with eachshipment, which references the letter of acceptance and which certifiesthat the components shipped meet all of the conditions of the acceptanceand all of the applicable performance requirements. Each letter of acceptancealso indicates that the acceptance is contingent upon the component manufacturermaintaining a quality control program sufficient to substantiate the requiredaffidavits. This required quality control program is not more specificallydefined.The other method of obtaining acceptance as a non-standard component, componentrecognition by a recognized laboratory, is handled directly by the recognizedlaboratory. The component manufacturer submits samples of the prospectivenon-standard component to the recognized laboratory for testing againstperformance requirements similar to those used in evaluating componentsfor which a Coast Guard letter of acceptance is requested. The recognizedlaboratory then prepares a test report and draft procedures for productioninspections of the component, which are submitted to the Coast Guard forreview. The Coast Guard review checks for both adequacy of the test resultsand accuracy and completeness of the product description in the productioninspection procedure. After resolving any discrepancies, the Coast Guardnotifies the laboratory in writing that the submission is acceptable ifthe product is found to meet all of the applicable requirements. The laboratorythen commences recognition of the product in accordance with their establishedprocedures, and marks the product in production with the ``recognitionmark'' of the laboratory. The recognition mark is considered adequate evidencethat a component meets appropriate non-standard component performance requirements,and serves the same function as an affidavit under the letter of acceptanceprogram.The key difference between component recognition and the Coast Guard letterof acceptance program for non-standard components is that under componentrecognition, the component manufacturer's production quality control programis supplemented by a program of oversight by the recognized laboratory.This quality control oversight program requires the manufacturer to performcertain production tests and inspections, and includes periodically witnessingor supervising the manufacturer performing those tests and inspections,auditing the manufacturer's quality control records, and selecting randomproduct samples for follow-up product testing at the laboratory. Beyondproduct testing to obtain acceptance every five years, the Coast Guardletter of acceptance program contains no specific provision for Coast Guardor independent laboratory oversight over quality control in production.While the use of non-standard components in PFD's was in the developmentalstage, the existing procedures for acceptance functioned generally well.However, the use of non-standard components has not increased to almostcompletely replace standard components in the manufacture of PFD's. Experiencewith certain generic categories of components has grown to where individualtesting has become in many cases redundant, since many non-standard componentsare virtually identical, and many generic products have established a sufficientsatisfactory field service history that they may now be considered, asclasses, to provide a degree of safety equivalent to standard components.The volume of testing currently being done, coupled with the associatedadministrative efforts involved in processing requests for Coast Guardletters of acceptance, has overloaded the system to create a perpetualbacklog of acceptance requests. This backlog often causes lengthy delaysin processing new requests. These dalays may limit the flexibility of PFDmanufacturers in selecting component suppliers, which can lead to productiondelays and additional production costs which are then passed on to theconsumer. The staff time required to effectively administer the programalso causes inordinate delays in other activities of interest to the industry,such as review of submissions for component recognition and approval ofPFD's and other equipment.Particularly for fabric, the nature of the manufacturing process has madethe Coast Guard letter of acceptance program ineffective. In many instances,the person nominally responsible for the quality of the product (who signsthe affidavit certifying the same) in reality has very limited direct knowledgeof or control over the specific lot to which the affidavit applies. Thesupplier of a fabric (referred to within the industry as a ``converter''),who purchases rough or ``greige'' goods from a weaving mill and then coordinatesthe necessary processing through one or more dyers and finishers, in alllikelihood never actually comes in contact with the fabric he/she is certifying.Some dyers and finishers do not even maintain laboratories, and so do nothave the ability to test the fabric in production. The effect of this lackof direct involvement by the fabric converter in the manufacturing processand in quality control at the various manufacturing steps and locationsis that fabrics accepted under Coast Guard letters of acceptance exhibitsufficient variance in production that they have recently been prone tofrequent failures when randomly tested for compliance by a recognized laboratory.The prevalence of failures during random laboratory testing strongly suggeststhat some fabric used in the construction of Coast Guard approved PFD'smay not meet the performance requirements that were used to evaluate thecomponent when originally submitted to the Coast Guard pursuant to requestinga letter of acceptance. As the primary structural component of a PFD, failureof PFD fabric creates a significant potential for failures of PFD's resultingin serious injuries or fatalities.Considered AlternativesThree alternative approaches to the resolution of the problems of the existingacceptance program for non-standard components were considered and willbe discussed individually, with the selected alternative which is the basisof this proposal discussed last.Under the first alternative, component manufacturer self-certification,specific production quality control requirements for all components, bothstandard and non-standard, would be established in regulation. These specificproduction quality control requirements would be similar to those currentlyin use under the recognized laboratory component recognition program, whichwere developed jointly with the Coast Guard. The component manufacturerwould provide certification directly to the PFD manufacturer that the componentsmeet the applicable requirements. There would be no Coast Guard or recognizedlaboratory oversight over production quality control. This alternativewould be similar to the existing program applied to standard and non-standardcomponents, except that specifically defined production quality controlrequirements would be provided in place of the existing general requirementto have a quality control program. This alternative is not considered tobe an effective solution to the existing problems. Many manufacturers ofnon-standard components either do not have any established quality controlprogram, even though required by the letter of acceptance to have one,or they have a nominal program but do not implement it effectively enoughto assure the quality of the product. Without an additional enforcementmechanism such as ``in factory'' oversight of a production quality controlprogram, it is apparent that the industry will not readily comply withany requirement to have a quality control program. The problem of inadequatenon-standard components being used in the construction of Coast Guard approvedPFD's could be expected to remain.The second alternative considered is essentially the same as the first,but also with oversight by Coast Guard marine inspectors over productionquality control for non-standard components. This alternative is considerednot to be viable due to limited Coast Guard resources. Existing regulationsin 46 CFR part 160 require visits to PFD manufacturers by inspectors. Dueto limited Coast Guard personnel resources, visits by Coast Guard inspectorswere replaced in 1983 by implementation of the independent laboratory productiontesting and inspection procedures in 46 CFR 159.007. There has been nochange in the level of Coast Guard personnel resources which would makea return of the marine inspectors to the PFD or component manufacturersfeasible.The third alternative, which forms the basis for this proposal, is establishmentof detailed production quality control requirements for all componentsas in the first and second alternatives, in conjuction with requirementsfor quality control oversight of non-standard components by a recognizedlaboratory (component recognition). This proposal, which is similar tothe previous alternative except that quality control oversight of non-standardcomponents in production would be provided by a recognized laboratory atthe component manufacturer's expense rather than by the Coast guard, addressesthe problems left unresolved by the other considered alternatives. Thepresence of an independent oversight organization would be intended toencourage a non-standard component manufacturer to tighten up a previouslylax quality control program, resulting in a more consistent product. Forfabric, this may mean exerting additional control and ovesight over thevarious facilities involved in the manufacturing process. The potentialfor unsatisfactory product entering the market would thus be significantlyreduced. The reduced Coast Guard review time for submissions for componentrecognition as compared to the time involved to process letters of acceptancewould reduce the backlog of submissions and consequently reduce delaysin acceptance of components.The proposed quality control requirements for standard components and recognizednon-standard components principally represent a codification of longstandingpractice. Standard components and recognized non-standard components havehad a generally good record of quality control. Accordingly, these proposedrules as they address these products should have little or no impact. Thepurpose of this proposal as it addresses these products is to explain currentpractice and to provide an opportunity for public comment.Performance Requirements for ThreadThe present requirements for thread used in PFD's are contained in 46 CFR160.001-2(j), which requires that thread for wearable PFD's, dependingupon its composition, meet the requirements of one of three federal specifications.The three acceptable compositions are cotton, nylon, and polyester. Requirementsfor thread for securing beckets on commercial ring buoys (throwable PFD's)are contained in 46 CFR 160.050-3(e), which specifies a federal specificationfor nylon thread and allows for other threads of equivalent size and strength.Cotton thread has been the cause of several reported PFD failures. Althoughcotton thread is stronger for a particular size than synthetic thread whennew, it is susceptible to deterioration from fungal attack (i.e., mildew).Field reports of equipment failures strongly suggest that cotton thread'svulnerability to environmental elements typical of expected PFD use conditionsmake it unsuitable for use in PFD's. The nature of thread's role in a PFDmeans that a failure of thread could lead to a total failure of the devicein which it is used if any load is applied. For that reason, these proposedrules would eliminate cotton thread as an acceptable PFD component in structuralapplications.This prohibition of cotton thread is to a large extent academic, sincethere are presently no PFD manufacturers using cotton thread in construction.The availability of cotton thread on the market is very limited. Cottonthread is generally not considered to be suitable for use with syntheticfabrics, and so a natural consequence of the industry's conversion to theuse of synthetic fabrics is that the use of cotton thread was discontinued.An analysis of all thread acceptances issued since the inception of thecomponent acceptance program revealed that all accepted threads to datehave met the requirements of either a federal specification in 46 CFR 160.001-2(j)(for sizes other than those specified), or one of two other military specifications,MIL-T-43548 for polyester core thread and MIL-T-43624 for spun polyesterthread. All of these specifications contain detailed quality control provisionswhich are considered to be equivalent to the quality control provisionsin these proposed rules. In view of the excellent field service historyand lack of failures (in either the field or the laboratory) involvingthese currently non-standard threads, quality control oversight is notconsidered to be necessary. Accordingly, these rules would redesignatestandard components all synthetic threads certified to comply with thespecified portions of the referenced federal and military specifications.It is anticipated that there would be few, if any, non-standard threads.Future Additional ProjectsFuture proposed rules will address performance requirements for fabricand other PFD components. A separate subpart will be devoted to each component.In this rulemaking, only the general subpart 46 CFR 164.019, which appliesto all components, and 46 CFR 164.023, which deals specifically with thread,are included. It is envisioned that future proposed rules relating to othercomponents will follow closely the structure and format of the thread subpartand will include proposals to adopt performance standards similar to thosecurrently applied to non-standard components under the Coast Guard letterof acceptance program. These performance standards may be presented asreferenced to appropriate voluntary industry standards, where suitablesuch standards exist.Cross Reference to Existing RegulationsSome revisions to existing regulations in title 46 CFR would be necessaryto implement these proposed rules. References to the component acceptanceprocedures and quality control and certification requirements in proposedsubpart 164.019 would be added to the ``Materials'' section(s) of eachof existing subparts 160.001, 160.002, 160.005, 160.047, 160.048, 160.049,160.050, 160.052, 160.053, 160.055, and 160.077. Existing requirementsfor thread in the ``Materials'' section(s) of each of existing subparts160.001, 160.002, 160.005, 160.047, 160.048, 160.049, 160.050, 160.052,160.055, and 160.077 would be replaced with references to the requirementsin proposed subpart 164.023. Proposed subpart 164.023 would be referencedas an exception to the material requirements of the military specificationreferenced in 46 CFR 160.053-3(a).<ITAG tagnum="84">5. Draft Regulatory Evaluation</ITAG>These proposed regulations are considered to be non-major under ExecutiveOrder 12291 on Federal Regulation and non-significant under DOT regulatorypolicies and procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). A draft regulatoryevaluation has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket. It maybe inspected and copied at the address listed under <T2>ADDRESSES</T2>. Copies may also be obtained by contacting the personlisted under <T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</T2>.The cost of these proposed rules is estimated to be $11,500.00 annuallyfor the first five years. This figure represents the cost for five existingmanufacturers/converters of non-standard component fabrics not currentlyunder a quality control oversight program of a recognized laboratory toenter and maintain their products in such a program over that period. Basedupon an average 7 million PFD's produced and sold each year, this costwould be refelected in an increase in the cost of an approved PFD of 0.815cents over the initial five year period if all added component manufacturercosts were passed on to the PFD manufacturer and then to the consumer.Continuing costs in subsequent years are estimated to be similar.Thread is the only PFD component other than fabric for which a significantnumber of non-standard products not under recognized laboratory qualitycontrol oversight are in use. However, because these proposed rules wouldin effect convert all existing non-standard component threads to standardcomponents, the proposed requirement for quality control oversight fornon-standard components would not be expected to result in any increasedcosts for thread manufacturers.The proposed production quality control requirements would be expectedto have little or no impact on manufacturers of standard components andnon-standard components currently under recognized laboratory quality controloversight. As stated previously, the proposed regulations essentially representa codification of longstanding procedures and requirements that are currentlyapplied to these components.These proposed rules would be expected to result in a savings to the CoastGuard of an estimated one half man-year of professional staff effort currentlyspent in the administration of the non-standard component letter of acceptanceprogram, a benefit of approximately $30,000.00 annually. The increase inavailable staff time would also benefit PFD and PFD component manufacturers,since it would expedite the processing of PFD approval and component acceptancesubmissions, thus reducing the potential for manufacturing and deliverydelays due to long waits for Coast Guard review.The effective conversion of all non-standard component threads currentlyaccepted under Coast Guard letters of acceptance to standard componentswould result in a savings to the industry of an estimated $500.00 per productevery five years. This figure represents the cost of sending detailed productspecifications and performance test results to the Coast Guard for renewalof the letter of acceptance every five years. Based on approximately 25products currently accepted under letters of acceptance, the total savingsto the industry would be $12,500.00 over a five year period or an averageof $2,500.00 per year.It is expected that the proposed additional quality control requirementsfor non-standard components would reduce the incidence of failures of thesecomponents currently seen in random performance testing. Although difficultto quantify, the potential for future injuries or fatalities due to failuresof components which do not meet the specified minimum performance requirementswould therefore be reduced.An intangible benefit of these proposed rules is that previously unpublishedpolicies and procedures would be made readily available to the public,reducing the likelihood of errors and misinterpretations of existing policy.<ITAG tagnum="84">6. Environmental Analysis</ITAG>This proposed rulemaking has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guardand it has been determined to be categorically excluded from further environmentaldocumentation in accordance with sections 2.B.2.c and 2.B.2.1 of CommandantInstruction (COMDTINST) M16475.1B. A Categorical Exclusion Determinationstatement has been prepared and is included as part of the regulatory package.<ITAG tagnum="84">7. Federalism Assessment</ITAG>This NPRM has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that thisproposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications towarrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">8. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through612), the Coast Guard has considered whether this rulemaking is likelyto have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated smallbusinesses which are not dominant in their field and which would otherwisequalify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small BusinessAct (15 U.S.C. 632).There are an estimated five fabric manufacturers or converters who wouldbe required to obtain component recognition for PFD component fabric underthese proposed rules. The added cost per manufacturer would be an estimated$11,435.00 over the initial five-year period, or $2,287.00 per year. Basedupon the quantity of fabric produced, this cost would represent less thanone-tenth of one percent of gross revenues for PFD component fabric. Itis likely that this cost would be partially or entirely passed on to thePFD manufacturer and ultimately the PFD buyer. In view of these considerations,and the fact that PFD component fabric generally represents only a smallportion of a fabric manufacturer's business, the impact on these manufacturersis considered to be minor.Based upon these estimates, the Coast Guard certifies that the proposedregulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.However, if you feel that your business qualifies as a small entity andwould suffer significant, negative, economic impact, please explain whyyour business qualifies as a small entity and to what degree the proposedregulations would economically affect your business. Cost data submittedwill be thoroughly evaluated before publication of the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">9. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This proposed rulemaking contains information collection and recordkeepingrequirements. Some of these requirements have previously been reviewedand approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the PaperworkReduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).
