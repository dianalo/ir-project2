Under the Modified Policy, crude oil overchargemonies are divided among the states, the federal government, and injuredpurchasers of refined products. Refunds to the states will be distributedin proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products duringthe period of price controls. Refunds to eligible purchasers will be basedon the number of gallons of petroleum products which they purchased andthe extent to which they can demonstrate injury.Applications for refund must be filed by October 31, 1989, and should besent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice.

These procedures are used to refund monies to those injuredby actual or alleged violations of the DOE price regulations.The ERA has filed four Petitions for the Implementation of Special RefundProcedures for crude oil overcharge funds obtained from New York Petroleum,Inc. (NYP), Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (Chevron), Patton Oil Company (Patton),and Ladd Petroleum Corporation (Ladd).\1\<NOTE/> These four firms remitted a total of $7.2 million to theDOE pursuant to court approved settlements, adjudications or DOE consentorders. An additional $504,000 in interest has accrued on that amount asof November 30, 1988. This Decision and Order establishes procedures fordistributing these funds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The OHA previously established refund procedures for thecrude oil overcharge funds obtained from NYP pursuant to a court-approvedsettlement. <T3>New York Petroleum, Inc.,</T3> 12 DOE andpara; 85,047 (1984). Those procedurespermitted direct purchasers of NYP crude oil to submit applications forrefund. <T3>See New York Petroleum, Inc./Ashland Oil, Inc., </T3>16 DOE andpara;85,613 (1987). Since that time, the Stripper Well Settlement Agreementhas been implemented. As explained below, the Settlement Agreement permitspurchasers of refined petroleum products that were injured by alleged crudeoil overcharges, such as those settled in the NYP litigation, to submitapplications for refund to the OHA. The remaining $115,580.42 in NYP fundsare subject to the terms of the Settlement Agreement.<ITAG tagnum="28">Ladd remitted $2,887,611.31 to the DOE pursuant to a July 27, 1987Judgement of the United States District Court for the Eastern Districtof Louisiana.

The Subpart V process may be used in situations where the DOE cannotreadily identify the persons who may have been injured as a result of actualor alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of therefund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of SubpartV and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds,see <T3>Office of Enforcement,</T3> 9 DOE andpara; 82,508 (1981), and <T3>Office of Enforcement,</T3> 8 DOE andpara; 82,597 (1981). We have consideredthe ERA's requests to implement Subpart V procedures with respect to themonies received from the four firms listed above, and have determined thatsuch procedures are appropriate.I. BackgroundOn July 28, 1986, the DOE issued a Modified Statement of RestitutionaryPolicy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (``theMSRP''). The MSRP, issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement Agreementin <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>M.D.L. No. 378 (D. Kan.), provides the crude oil overcharge fundswill be divided among the states, the federal government, and injured purchasersof refined petroleum products. Under the MSRP, up to 20 percent of thesecrude oil overcharge funds will be reserved initially to satisfy validclaims by injured purchasers of petroleum products. Eighty percent of thefunds, and any monies remaining after all valid claims are paid, are tobe disbursed equally to the states and federal government for indirectrestitution.The OHA has been applying the MSRP to all Subpart V proceedings involvingalleged crude oil violations. <T3>See</T3> Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986).That Order provided a period of 30 days for the filing of any objectionsto the application of the MSRP, and solicited comments concerning the appropriateprocedures to follow in processing refund applications in crude oil refundproceedings.On April 10, 1987, the OHA issued a notice analyzing the numerous commentswhich it received in response to the August 1986 Order. 52 FR 11737. Thenotice set forth generalized procedures and provided guidance to assistclaimants that wish to file refund applications for crude oil monies underthe Subpart V regulations. All applicants for refunds would be requiredto document their purchse volumes of petroleum products during the periodof price controls and to prove that they were injured by the alleged overcharges.The notice indicated that end-users of petroleum products whose businessesare unrelated to the petroleum industry will be presumed to have absorbedthe crude oil overcharges, and need not submit any further proof of injuryto receive a refund. Finally, we stated that refunds would be calculatedon the basis of a volumetric refund amount derived by dividing crude oilviolation amounts by the total consumption of petroleum products in theUnited States during the period of price controls. The numerator wouldinclude the crude oil overcharge monies that were in the DOE's escrow accountat the time of the settlement and a portion of the funds in the M.D.L.378 escrow at the time of the settlement.The DOE has applied these procedures in numerous cases since the April1987 Notice, <T3>see, e.g., Shell Oil Co.,</T3> 17 DOE andpara; 85,204 (1988), and <T3>Ernest A. Allerkamp,</T3> 17 DOE andpara; 85,079 (1988), and the procedureshave been approved by the United States District Court for the Districtof Kansas. Various States had filed a Motion with that Court, claimingthat the OHA violated the Settlement Agreement by employing presumptionsof injury for end-users and by improperly calculating the refund amountto be used in those proceedings. On August 17, 1987, Judge Theis issuedan Opinion and Order denying the States' Motion in its entirety. The courtconcluded that the Settlement Agreement ``does not bar OHA from permittingclaimants to employ reasonable presumptions in affirmatively demonstratinginjury entitling them to a refund.'' <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>671 F. Supp. 1318, 1323 (D. Kan. 1987). The court also ruled that, as specifiedin the April 1987 Notice, the OHA could calculate refunds based on a portionof the M.D.L. 378 overcharges. <T3>Id.</T3> at 1323-24. The States appealed the latter ruling, and theTemporary Emergency Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Theis' decision. <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>3 Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara; 26,606 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1988).II. The Proposed Decision and OrderOn July 26, 1988, the OHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDandamp;O)establishing tenative procedures to distribute the alleged crude oil violationamounts obtained from NYP, Chevron, Patton and Ladd. The OHA tentativelyconcluded that the monies in those cases should be distributed in accordancewith the MSRP and the April 10, 1987 Notice. Pursuant to the MSRP, theOHA proposed to reserve initially 20 percent of the alleged crude oil violationamounts for direct restitution to applicants who claim that they were injuredby the alleged crude oil violations. The remaining 80 percent of the fundswould be distributed to the states and federal government for indirectrestitution. After all valid claims are paid, any remaining funds in theclaims reserve also would be divided between the states and federal government.The federal government's share ultimately would be deposited into the generalfund of the Treasury of the United States.In the PDandamp;O, the OHA proposed to require applicants for refund to documenttheir purchase volumes of petroleum products during the period of pricecontrols and to prove that they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges.The PDandamp;O stated that end-users of petroleum products whose businessesare unrelated to the petroleum industry could use a presumption that theyabsorbed the crude oil overcharges, and need not submit any further proofof injury to receive a refund. The OHA also proposed to calculate refundson the basis of a volumetric refund amount, as described in the April 10,1987 Notice. Comments were solicited regarding the tentative distributionprocess set forth in the PDandamp;O.III. Discussion of the Comments ReceivedIn response to the PDandamp;O, the OHA received comments from three parties:Chevron; a group of 15 States of the United States (``the States''); andPhilip P. Kalodner as counsel for six electric utilities, 14 foreign-flagshipping companies, and four pulp and paper manufacturers. Mr. Kalodner'sclients are all potential recipients of crude oil refunds. In general,the commenters addressed two issues: (1) The amount of funds reserved topay injured claimants; and (2) the presumption of injury for end-users.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In its comments, Chevron noted a factual omission in thePDandamp;O. The Chevron Consent Order, Number RGFE006A1Z, settled violationsof the crude oil pricing regulations allegedly committed by Gulf Oil Corporation(Gulf), not Chevron. According to Chevron, it entered into this ConsentOrder after it had acquired Gulf. The PDandamp;O failed to state that theConsent Order which was executed by Chevron does not actually involve anyalleged crude oil violations by that firm.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. The Amount Reserved for Refunds to Claimants</ITAG>In his comments, Mr. Kalodner contends that the OHA should not distribute80 percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts to the states andfederal government. According to Kalodner, such a distribution will ``precludefull direct restitution to claimants.'' Kalodner comments at 4. Kalodnerclaims that the 20-percent reserve is insufficient to satisfy all of thelegitimate claims that have been or will be filed in these proceedings.Kalodner asserts that both the DOE and the states assured the United StatesDistrict Court for the District of Kansas that the amount reserved forthe claims process would be adequate to provide refunds for all successfulclaimants. ``Having provided that asurance in order to obtain approvalof the Court of the Final Settlement Agreement and the benefits to themselves,the states and the DOE are required by the doctrine of judicial estoppelto make good on that assurance.'' Kalodner comments at 5.There is absolutely no evidence that the 20-percent reserve will be insufficientto pay claimants. We have examined Kalodner's assertions and find themunsupported. Moreover, the 20-percent set aside is mandated by the followingterms of the Settlement Agreement:<ITAG tagnum="21">OHA may reserve a reasonable portion of funds from each such proceedingto satisfy potentially provable claims of identifiable injured claimantswho have not waived their claims, but such reserve <T3>shall not exceed 20 percent</T3> of the monies in such proceeding andamounts in excess of the reserve shall be distributed while awaiting completionof the first stage refund proceedings. The percentage of the reserve willbe altered * * * periodically * * * to reflect the amount of reserve thatis warranted and sufficient to provide adequate funding for eligible first-stageclaims, and will be lowered as justified by claims experience as a consequenceof this Agreement.</ITAG>Settlement Agreement at IV.B.6, 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara; 90,509at 90,665 (emphasis added).Thus the OHA may not set aside more than 20 percent of alleged crude oilviolation amounts for direct refunds to injured claimants. The OHA mayreduce the size of this reserve, but it may not raise the reserve above20 percent of the funds received. <T3>A. Tarricone, Inc., </T3>15 DOE andpara; 85,495 at 88,893 (1987). Theremainder of the crude oil violation amounts must be distributed to thestates and federal government prior to the completion of the refund claimsprocess. As stated in the PDandamp;O, we have decided to reserve initiallythe full 20 percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts subjectto this determination in order to ensure that sufficient funds will beavailable for refunds to injured claimants. We will therefore adopt theprocedures as proposed in the PDandamp;O, and order the disbursement of 80percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts to the states and federalgovernment.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Mr. Kalodner also suggests in his comments that we addvarious amounts to the numerator of the volumetric formula in order toincrease the size of refunds. These suggestions were previously consideredand rejected in <T3>Allerkamp, </T3>17 DOE at 88,174-175. Mr. Kalodner has presented nonew arguments to justify a reconsideration of those issues in this determination.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. The Presumption of Injury for End-Users </ITAG>The only matter addressed by the States in their comments is the use ofa presumption of injury to allow end-users to meet their burden of provinginjury. Of the many issues relating to the end-user presumption raisedin the States' comments, two warrant further discussion. First, the Statesask whether the presumption of injury is rebuttable. Second, the Statesrequest ``clear guidelines as to what evidence is relevant or sufficientto rebut'' the presumption. States' comments at 1. <T3>1. The presumption of injury is rebuttable. </T3>We agree with theStates that the presumption of injury for end-users is rebuttable, andhave so indicated on numerous previous occasions. <T3>See, e.g., Allerkamp, </T3>17 DOE at 88,172; <T3>Berry Holding Co., </T3>16 DOE andpara; 85,405 at 88,797 (1987). In <T3>Allerkamp, </T3>we discussed the presumption of injury and the burdensof proof as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">The claimants' burden of proof is eased by the presumption. If aninterested party submits evidence to rebut the presumption of injury, wemust first determine whether the evidence submitted is relevant to theissue. If the evidence is relevant and sufficient to rebut the presumption,the claimant has the burden of coming forward with further evidence ofinjury. However, if we find the evidence submitted to rebut the presumptionto be insufficient, a refund to the end-user can be approved, based onthe weight of the presumption, without requiring the end-user to submitfurther evidence of injury. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">17 DOE at 88,172-73 <T3>2. Evidence required to rebut the presumption of injury. </T3>In theircomments, the States request ``clear guidelines'' concerning the evidencethat the OHA considers ``relevant and sufficient'' to rebut the end-userpresumption. States' comments at 1. As explained below, we cannot approvethe States' request. Further ``guidelines'' are neither necessary nor appropriatein the context of this order establishing refund procedures, and they canbe issued only in connection with individual refund claims. The States wrongly claim that the end-user presumption is based only ``onthe need for efficient procedure.'' States' comments at 9. The end-userpresumption was adopted first and foremost as an evidentiary tool so thatparties injured by crude oil overcharges would have the opportunity toobtain some measure of restitution of those overcharges. As we previouslynoted, the DOE ``has a duty to identify injured persons and, to the extentpossible, to make direct refunds to them.'' <T3>Tarricone, </T3>15 DOE at 88,894. This duty arises in part from section209 of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, 12 U.S.C. 1904 (note), andthe Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C.4502(b). To fulfill this Congressional mandate and assure that restitutionis achieved, the OHA must take into account the complexity of oil overchargeproceedings, as well as the difficulty in actually proving injury fromcrude oil overcharges, caused in part by the passage of time since theperiod of price controls and difficulties applicants may experience inlocating records and relevant market data. <T3>Tarricone, </T3>15 DOE at 88,894. <T3>See also Report to the United States District Court for the Districtof Kansas, In re: Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>6 Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara; 90,507 (1985) (the <T3>Stripper Well Report</T3>) (evidentiary hearing, during which the OHAdetermined the amount of crude oil overcharges absorbed by refiners asa class, resulted in a record of nearly 13,000 pages of written and oraltestimony from 64 public and private entities). The Subpart V regulationsreflect the DOE's awareness of these factors, and specifically authorizethe use of presumptions for the evaluation of individual refund claims.10 CFR 205.282(e). If end-user claimants were routinely required to submit detailed evidenceof injury in order to receive refunds for crude oil overcharges, a greatmajority of claimants would find that the refunds in question were notworth the time and cost involved in pursuing them. The result would bethe complete frustration of the restitutionary purposes of these proceedings,since ``virtually no end-users would receive restitution for the crudeoil overcharages they experienced.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 88,895. Accordingly, the presumption satisfies the importantrestitutionary policy objectives outlined above. Moreover, the States'challenge to the presumption was rejected by Judge Theis, who found theStates' arguments unpersuasive and upheld this fundamental element of theOHA's crude oil refund process. <T3>See In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>671 F. Supp. at 1323. The States may not relitigate those issues inthis proceeding under the guise of seeking ``clear guidelines'' on howto rebut the end-user presumption.The crude oil refund procedures have been extremely effective in makingrefunds available to many members of the overcharged community. To date,the OHA has decided over 40,000 crude oil refund applications. Our decisionson individual crude oil refund applications hold that the presumption ofinjury is a sufficient basis for approving a refund unless an interestedparty submits relevant and sufficient evidence to the contrary concerninga particular applicant. <T3>See, e.g., Royal Crown of Angelo, Inc., </T3>17 DOE andpara;85,734 at89,398 (1988). If an objecting party submits sufficient evidence to rebutthe presumption, however, the burden of going forward with the evidenceshifts to the applicant, who must then present relevant information tosupport its Application for Refund. <T3>See Christian Haaland A/S, </T3>17 DOE andpara;85,439 at 88,865 (1988)(factual and legal issues raised by the States rebutted the presumptionand shifted the burden of going forward with the evidence to the applicants);<T3>Cook Construction Co., </T3>18 DOE andpara;_, No. RF272-2005 (December1, 1988) (issues raised by the States concerning price escalator clausesin the applicant's contracts partially rebutted the presumption of injuryfor that applicant).The States are aware of the type of evidence that is necessary to rebutthe end-user presumption. They successfully presented such evidence in<T3>Christian Haaland </T3>and <T3>Cook Construction. </T3>The evidence required to rebut the presumptionmust be of sufficient weight to cast serious doubt upon the notion thatthe applicant was injured by crude oil overcharges. Generalized assertionsor allegations concerning injury clearly will not satisfy this standard.<T3>See, e.g., Chicago Transit Authority, </T3>17 DOE andpara;85,223 at 88,440(1988) (inadequate proof of the assertion that all governmental units passedthrough overcharges); <T3>Gulf States Asphalt Co., </T3>18 DOE andpara;85,154 at 88,250 (1988)(broad statement that ``almost every industry'' was able to pass throughsome of its increased costs found insufficient to rebut the presumption).Industry-wide data that has no relationship to the individual applicantalso will be insufficient. <T3>Royal Crown, </T3>17 DOE at 89,398 (evidence of pass through of increasedsugar costs irrelevant to determination of pass through of increased energycosts); <T3>Airborne Express, Inc., </T3>18 DOE andpara;85,170 at 88,278 (1988) (evidenceof cost pass through by the scheduled passenger airlines insufficient torebut the injury presumption for all-cargo airlines); <T3>Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </T3>18 DOE andpara;85,141 at 88,227(1988) (industry-wide data insufficient to rebut the presumption in industrieswhere the energy needs of individual firms vary due to firm-specific operatingfactors). Moreover, evidence of sustained growth and profitability of aparticular firm or industry will not in and of itself rebut the presumption.<T3>Los Angeles Times, </T3>18 DOE andpara;85,013 at 88,022-23 (1988).These are equitable proceedings, and the facts and circumstances of eachcontested case must be carefully weighed and balanced to achieve restitutionto injured claimants. Therefore, the adjudication of contested crude oilrefund claims under the Subpart V regulations will continue on a case-by-casebasis, as envisioned in Paragraph IV.B.1 of the Settlement Agreement.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The States raise other, similar theoretical objectionsand questions concerning the crude oil refund process. These are inappropriatefor the same reasons discussed in the text. Each crude oil refund applicationmust be analyzed individually. Differences arise from various company-specificfactors, including competitive environments, the effects of long-term contracts,and the mix of products produced by a particular firm.IV. The Refund Procedures<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Refund Claims</ITAG>After considering the comments received, we have concluded that the $7.2million in alleged crude oil violation amounts covered by this Decision,plus the $504,000 in interest which has accrued on that amount as of November30, 1988, should be distributed in accordance with the crude oil refundprocedures previously discussed. As noted in section III.A, <T3>supra, </T3>we have decided to reserve initially the full 20 percentof the alleged crude oil violation amounts, or the $1.54 million includinginterest, for direct refunds to claimants, in order to ensure that sufficientfunds will be available for refunds to injured persons. The amount of thereserve may be adjusted downward later if circumstances warrant such action.The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on allegedcrude oil violations will be modeled after the process the OHA has usedin Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overchargesinvolving refined products. <T3>MAPCO, Inc., </T3>15 DOE andpara;85,097 (1986); <T3>Mountain Fuel Supply Co., </T3>14 DOE andpara;85,475 (1986). As in non-crudeoil cases, applicants will be required to document their purchase volumesand to prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged violations.Following Subpart V precedent, reasonable estimates of purchase volumesmay be submitted. <T3>Greater Richmond Transit Co., </T3>15 DOE andpara;85,028 at 88,050 (1986).Generally, it is not necessary for applicants to identify their suppliersof petroleum products in order to receive a refund.Applicants who were end-users or ultimate consumers of petroleum products,whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry, and who werenot subject to the DOE price regulations are presumed to have absorbedrather then passed on alleged crude oil overcharges. In order to receivea refund, end-users need not submit any further evidence of injury beyondvolumes of product purchased, <T3>See Tarricone, </T3>15 DOE, at 88,893-96. The end-user presumptionof injury is rebuttable, however. <T3>Berry Holding Co., </T3>16 DOE at 88,797. If an interested party submitsevidence which is of sufficient weight to cast serious doubt on the end-userpresumption, the applicant will be required to produce further evidenceof injury.Reseller and retailer claimants must submit detailed revidence of injury,and may not rely on the presumptions of injury utilized in refund casesinvolving refined petroleum products. They can, however, use econometricevidence of the type employed by the OHA in the <T3>Stripper Well Report. </T3>Applicants who executed and submitted avalid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows established in the SettlementAgreement have waived their rights to apply for crude oil refunds underSubpart V. <T3>Boise Cascase Corp., </T3>16 DOE andpara;85,214 at 88,411 (1987); <T3>Sea-Land Service, Inc., </T3>16 DOE andpara;85,496 at 88,991 n.1 (1987).Refunds to eligible claimants who purchased refined petroleum productswill be calculated on the basis of a volumetric refund amount derived bydividing the crude oil violation amounts involved in this determination($7.2 million) by the total consumption of petroleum products in the UnitedStates during the period of price controls (2,020,997,335,000 gallons).<T3>Mountain Fuel, </T3>14 DOE at 88,868. This yields a volumetric refundamount of $0.0000035658 per gallon. Refund applications submitted pursuantto this Decision must be filed by October 31, 1989, the deadline establishedin <T3>World Oil Co., </T3>17 DOE andpara;85,568 (1988).As we stated in previous Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will berequired to submit only one application for crude oil overcharge funds.<T3>See Allerkamp, </T3>17 DOE at 88,176. Any party that has previouslysubmitted a refund application in crude oil refund proceedings need notfile another application; that application will be deemed to be filed inall crude oil proceedings finalized to date.\5\<NOTE/> The volumetric refund amount will be increased as additionalcrude oil violation amounts are received in the future. Applicants maybe required to submit additional information to document their refund claimsfor these future amounts. Notice of any additional amounts available inthe future will be published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The total volumetric refund amount approved in all proceedingsfinalized prior to and including <T3>Shell Oil </T3>was $0.0008442315. <T3>Shell Oil, </T3>17 DOE at 88,406. When the volumetric approved in <T3>World Oil co. </T3>and this Decision is added to that amount, the currenttotal per-gallon refund is $0.0008478963.To apply for a crude oil refund, a claimant should submit an applicationfor refund. That application should contain all of the following information:(1) Identifying information including the applicant's name, address, andsocial security number or employer identification number, an indicationwhether the applicant is a corporation, the name and telephone number ofa person to contact for any additional information, and the name and addressof the person who should receive the refund check;  (2) A short description of the applicant's business and how it used petroleumproducts. If the applicant did business under more than one name, or adifferent name during the period of price controls, the applicant shouldlist these names; (3) If the applicant's firm is owned by another company, or owns othercompanies, a list of those other companies' names and their relationshipsto the applicant's firm;  (4) A statement identifying the petroleum products which the applicantpurchased during the period August 19, 1973, through January 27, 1981,the number of gallons of each product purchased, and the total number ofgallons for all products purchased on which the applicant bases its claim;(5) An explanation of how the applicant obtained the volume figures above,and an explanation of its method of estimation if the applicant used estimatesto determine its purchase volumes;  (6) A statement that neither the applicant, its parent firm, affiliates,subsidiaries, successors nor assigns has waived any right it may have toreceive a refund in these cases (i.e. by having executed and submitteda valid waiver pursuant to any one of the escrow accounts established pursuantto the Settlement Agreement in the Stripper Well Exemption Litigation);(7) If the applicant is not an end-user whose business is unrelated tothe petroleum industry, a showing that the applicant was injured by thealleged overcharges (i.e. that the applicant did not pass through the overchargesto its own customers); and  (8) If the applicant is a regulated utility, a certification that it willnotify the state utility commission of any refund received and that itwill pass on the entirety of its refund to its retail customers.
