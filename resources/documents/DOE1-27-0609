Due to the needto reduce cost there has been an increased interest in the use of roofboltingas a method of systematic support. Using roofbolts a saving of 230 pounds/mof drivage could be achieved. This cost saving combined with roof conditionimprovement and the reduction in need for haulage transport, can improvethe efficiency of our deep mined coal.
