A motion, which defense lawyers in the case previously said they would pursue even though all charges against the three were dropped May 19, was filed Friday under seal before U.S. District Judge Louis L. Stanton by Paul J. Curran, a lawyer for Robert M. Freeman, head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    According to people familiar with the matter, Mr. Curran's motion repeats and expands upon charges made by defense lawyers in court last month that government prosecutors violated grand jury secrecy requirements by characterizing the indictment against Mr. Freeman and two others as &quot;merely the tip of an iceberg.&quot; Defense lawyers also cited statements made by U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani to this newspaper and during news conferences about the continuing grand jury investigation of the three former defendants. The government said in dropping the indictment that it intended to seek a new indictment, expanding the charges against the three men.    Lawyers not connected with the case said that the illegality of public statements by a federal prosecutor is difficult to prove, and that it isn't clear whether Judge Stanton will rule on the merits of the motion since no charges are pending against Mr. Freeman or his former co-defendants, Richard Wigton and Timothy L. Tabor. Mr. Wigton is former head of arbitrage at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., and Mr. Tabor is a former Kidder arbitrager. The three had been charged with mail, wire and securities fraud. Kidder is 80% owned by General Electric Co.    Mr. Giuliani declined to comment. A spokesman added that &quot;we aren't able to discuss the matter,&quot; even to confirm that the motion was filed Friday. Mr. Giuliani's office previously has denied that he or anyone else made any improper statements regarding the case.    Mr. Curran didn't return phone calls Friday.    Lawyers for the other two defendants didn't join in Friday's motion. Stanley S. Arkin, the attorney for Mr. Wigton, said, &quot;We aren't joining in the motion, but we don't oppose it and we are supportive of Mr. Curran.&quot; Andrew M. Lawler, the attorney for Mr. Tabor, declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
