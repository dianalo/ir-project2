David Boren, chairman of the Senate Agriculture credit subcommittee, promised fast action on a financial-aid package that would offer loans to the hard-pressed Farm Credit System.    At a hearing on possible government assistance to the big cooperative lending network, the Oklahoma Democrat said that &quot;the longer we delay action, the more it will cost,&quot; as relatively healthy banks in the system start to weaken. System banks, which hold one-third of the nation's farm debt, have incurred sizable losses in recent years.    In testimony before the Boren subcommittee, Farm Credit System officials, who have said publicly they hope to avoid federal financial help, moved closer to outright endorsement of a bailout.    Brent Beesley, president of the system's policy-making Farm Credit Corp. of America, testified that at a recent meeting in Denver, leaders of the system's 12 districts said that if federal assistance is required, the amount must be sufficient &quot;to strengthen borrower confidence&quot; and protect stock in the lending units that is owned by farmers who borrow from them.    Those leaders want federal help only to protect the stock of borrowers where needed, and want the government out of the picture as soon as possible, Mr. Beesley said. But they &quot;recognize that they may have to come back (for government assistance) for a short period,&quot; he added.    The government gave loans to the system in the 1930s and 1940s, which were repaid by 1968, Sen. Boren said.    Quick congressional assurance that system borrowers' stock will be protected is necessary, Mr. Beesley said. Otherwise, officials have warned, system banks may have to start dipping into that stock as other reserves are used up. Such concerns, along with interest rates that remain high relative to those of other farm lenders, are prompting many better-heeled borrowers to pay off their Farm Credit System debt and seek new loans elsewhere, the officials said.    These loan repayments are reducing the system's loan volume by more than $1 billion a month, Mr. Beesley said, which he called &quot;highly detrimental&quot; to the banks' &quot;long-term recovery and viability.&quot;    The system's projections of how much and what kind of federal assistance will be required won't be finished until late next month, he said.    Jim Billington, a director of the Farm Credit Administration, the system's regulator, said earlier this week that $800 million will be needed annually in each of the next three to four years, starting this year. Other informal estimates run much higher.    But Sen. Boren warned, &quot;There will be no blank checks.&quot; He said &quot;substantial reforms&quot; will be mandated in order to avoid repeating problems. For instance, the bailout conditions will include limits on the size of loans that system banks can make to farmers, in an effort to prevent those borrowers from plunging into debt as they did in the 1970s, the subcommittee chairman said.    He also said drafters of the Farm Credit System legislation will consider creating a secondary market for agricultural loans, similar to the government-created Federal National Mortgage Association and other federally chartered corporations.    A secondary market is widely favored by the Farm Credit System and other farm lenders to improve the marketing of loan portfolios and increase the ability of lenders to manage interest-rate risks by passing them on to investors. Farmers would find more long-term loans at better rates, Mr. Beesley said.    Credit System and commercial farm lenders have been working together on such a secondary-market plan, and it was embodied in a bill introduced yesterday by Sens. James Exon (D., Neb.) and Charles Grassley (R., Iowa). Sen. Boren also indicated that his credit bill would include subsidies to help all farm lenders reduce interest rates, the loan principal, or both, for many farmers. </TEXT></DOC>
