LEVI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Weakened by corruption and low prices,Mexico's giant Pemex petroleum monopoly has been trying to cutcosts and raise productivity as it struggles to stay afloat in aworld glutted with cheap oil.   But experts say the effort by President Miguel de la Madrid'sadministration has not made much headway, even though thewell-being of Pemex is vital to this debt-ridden country of 84million people.   ``Two of the main obstacles to raising productivity have beencorruption and a very powerful union that has been against trimmingan overblown work force,'' said one expert on the Mexican oilindustry, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Nevertheless, Pemex ``is enormously important'' to Mexico bothas ``a major source of foreign exchange, and the country's largesttax payer,'' said oil expert George W. Grayson in a telephoneinterview from Richmond, Va.   The taxes and royalties Pemex paid last year made up half thefederal government's revenues as it struggled through the nation'ssixth year of economic crisis. But the petroleum products it soldabroad accounted for 39.6 percent of the country's 1987 exportearnings, down from 79 percent in 1982 when the oil industry wasbooming here.   Petroleos Mexicanos S.A., as it is known by its formal name,monopolizes everything from exploring and drilling to heavypetrochemicals, transportation and wholesaling. Only the gasstations, which carry its logo, are privately owned concessions.   It was created by President Lazaro Cardenas, an army general,through an executive order issued March 18, 1938, a few days afterhe expropriated 17 foreign companies.   International financial circles did not expect Pemex to livelong because it lacked money, skills and technology.   Half a century later, Pemex is celebrating its 50th anniversaryas one of the world's biggest integrated petroleum companies and anational institution a majority of Mexicans take pride in.   The big bonanza came when Jose Lopez Portillo, the son of aPemex engineer, became president in late 1976, shortly after a newgeneration of Pemex geologists and engineers trained in moderntechniques, located fields in the southeast that turned out to beabout twice the size of Alaska's North Slope in Prudhoe Bay.   With half the world starved for petroleum because of highprices, Arab embargoes, and later erratic deliveries caused by theoutbreak of the Iran-Iraq war, the young technocrats at Pemexscrambled to find and develop even more sources of new oil.   Pemex has sole rights over all hydrocarbons in Mexico's 761,604square miles of national territory (three times the size of Texas)and over the 200-mile offshore belt on both coasts that Mexicoclaims as an exclusive economic zone.   As a result, the country's proven oil reserves of 48 billionbarrels in 1987 _ almost twice as big as those of the United States_ remain the world's fifth largest after Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, theSoviet Union and Venezuela.   But much of that oil lies inside tightly packed rock formations,making it too expensive to pump out at today's depressed prices.Reserves are down by an estimated 2 percent from three years ago,because exploration has not kept pace with production.   Exploration was restricted after the government cut Pemex'sbudget by 8 percent last year, along with almost everything excepta few priority projects, because of the country's economic crunch.   The bust came during the last months of Lopez Portillo'ssix-year term, when North Sea, Alaskan and other non-OPEC oilfieldsstarted to flood world markets and traditional producers beganslashing prices to hold on to their clients.   At the height of the oil boom from December 1980 to May 1981,Pemex light-grade Isthmus crude sold at $38.50 a barrel. As of thisJanuary, Isthmus crude had dropped to an average of $15.03 abarrel. February prices have not yet been released.   Aside from the price slide, the company also continues to battlecorruption, much of it centering around the Oil Workers Union,which represents 95 percent of Pemex's 183,000 workers andemployees.   De la Madrid, who inherited these problems along with a giantforeign debt now estimated at $105 billion and few resources tomeet payments on it, launched a ``moral renovation'' campaign atthe beginning of his administration and appointed Mario RamonBeteta, a veteran economist, as head of Pemex.   Beteta riled the union by trying to crack down on corruption,cutting costs and pork-barrel contracts to union companies. By law,5 percent of the value of all Pemex contracts used to go to theunion, which owns a host of service companies, from drilling topumping and construction. Beteta cut that to 2 percent, alsomandating that the contracts be awarded through open bidding.   Francisco Rojas, who succeeded Beteta last year, replaced fourof Pemex's seven deputy directors and laid off 900 non-unionemployees, but the fight against corruption continues. Industrysources say the union still wields considerable power and maintainsthe inside track on most contract work.   To hold down costs, Pemex has concentrated on developing the``gusher'' fields on- and off-shore in the southeastern part of theGulf of Mexico, where the oil is cheapest to produce.   Export revenues are down from an annual high of $16.4 billion in1982-84, to a low of $6.1 billion in 1986 and $8.5 billion lastyear. Production has dropped from an average of 2.65 millionbarrels a day, then, to 2.40 million in 1986 and 2.60 million lastyear.   About half of Pemex's production is used domestically, supplyingan estimated 90 percent of Mexico's energy needs.   Roughly a quarter more is exported to the United States. Therest goes mostly to Japan, Spain, France, Israel and CentralAmerica.   Mexico has consistently tried to project a conservative andindependent image as a world exporter. It refuses to join theOrganization Petroleum Exporting Countries, even though it hasreluctantly cooperated at times with the 13-nation cartel inreducing export volumes to buttress prices.   As a matter of policy, it also refuses to sell more than 50percent of its exports to any single country.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions March 12-13</NOTE></DOC>
