There was no reason to expecthumane treatment of prisoners of war.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ABUSED CAPTIVESGIVEN SADDAM'S RECORD, HIS TREATMENT OF PRISONERSOF WAR IS NO SURPRISE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Iraq said over the weekend that it would live up to the Geneva Conventionon treatment of prisoners, but the Americans' television appearance beliedthat claim. Then, on Monday, all pretense fell: Iraq announced it was usingthe prisoners as human shields, scattering them at likely targets of U.S. airraids, a blatant violation of the convention.;    That cannot change theallies' military strategy, of course. But it adds immeasurably to the anguishof the prisoners' families and of their countries.;    Pentagon officials wereworried by the statements given by the Americans, who are supposed to resistsaying anything but their name, rank and serial number. But the stiltedspeeches -- &quot;I think our leaders and our people have wrongly attacked thepeaceful people of Iraq&quot; -- were so unnatural, they fooled no one intothinking they were sincere. They elicit our pity for the captives, but theycan do no harm.;    Parading the prisoners helps Saddam rally his people, justas the random shelling of Israeli cities has done. Neither action inflicts thekind of damage on the allies that their air war is inflicting on Iraq, butthey are psychological tools. Stymied on a military defense, Saddam raises thestakes in his war of nerves.;    We can only pray for the safety of theprisoners, Americans and others, and reaffirm our hope for a swift conclusionto this conflict, which is likely to become far more painful to the UnitedStates before it is over.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910122  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  307  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 22, 199100022134,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
