The long-term effects on energy prices and availability are asuncertain as the next move in the Mideast drama. One factor: CanAmericans still conserve fuel and electricity the way they learnedto in leaner times? Will they?   The Associated Press checked with seven energy andtransportation specialists for that perspective on the Gulf crisis.Here are their responses:</TEXT><HEAD>John C. Sawhill, who held senior energy positions in the Nixon,</HEAD><TEXT>   Ford and Carter administrations, now president and chief executiveofficer of the Nature Conservancy:</TEXT><TEXT>   In my view, this is going to be a long, drawn-out affair. Oilprices have reached a new permanent plateau _ somewhere in themid-20s (dollars per barrel), and that's going to have a damagingeffect on the U.S. economy.   We're likely to see inflation and recession at the same time.Prices are going to go up, profits are going to get squeezed, andthe recession that was coming on anyway is going to be accelerated.   There are a number of things that the government can do torespond. Obviously, the first and most important is to encouragegreater energy conservation. During the years of low oil prices andabundant supplies we have forgotten about conservation, and it'stime to refocus our efforts on becoming more energy efficient.   Compared to the Japanese and the Germans, we squander energy.Now the time has come for real presidential leadership in this area.</TEXT><HEAD>Nauman Barakat, an energy specialist and first vice president</HEAD><TEXT>   at Lehman Brothers, New York:</TEXT><TEXT>   How many people do you know who have gone to a gas station andbought less because prices have gone up 15 cents? I don't knowanyone who has, and I don't think at this stage motorists arethinking along those lines.   Prices have to remain not only at these levels but go sharplyhigher to change driving habits in this country. If prices were toincrease by, say another 25 cents, then I think motorists wouldpossibly consider using public transportation and take othermeasures.   And I don't think that's going to happen. If it does, I don'tthink it's going to remain at that level. I think the Saudis wantto prevent a third price shock. We've been through two already(1973 and '79), and much of the OPEC producers, but particularlythe Saudis, recognize the danger in delivering such sharp increasesto the consumer.   They're worried about consumption decreasing because if pricesgo up sharply, the consumer is going to be interested again inconservation, buying smaller cars and all of that.   Ultimately, that would mean lower sales by the OPEC nations,particularly those that have excess capacity and want to use moreof that capacity.</TEXT><HEAD>T. Boone Pickens, general partner of Mesa Limited Partnership:</HEAD><TEXT>   We're going to work from a different level as to the cost ofenergy than we have in the past: If it's war, you're going to belooking at a $30-plus price for crude oil. And if it isn't war,you're looking at $25-plus.   As the price goes up for gasoline, the consumption goes down.And as the price of energy goes up, the economics will bring onalternative forms of energy.   The first thing that comes to mind is that there's a lot ofnatural gas available to us, and there should be fuel-switching tonatural gas right now from fuel oil.   It's a lot better to buy domestic natural gas than it is to buyforeign crude oil: One, it helps the trade deficit. But two,natural gas sells at a discount to crude oil. That means it'scheaper for the consumer.</TEXT><HEAD>Lee Iacocca, Chrysler Corp. chairman, speaking Aug. 14 after</HEAD><TEXT>   the formal production launch of the company's 1991 minivan:</TEXT><TEXT>   We've been in a recession for a year in housing and cars. I wishbecause of this (Gulf situation) we'd get to work on the budgetdeficit. We need it now more than ever and certainly (we need) anenergy policy.   I always felt that if we taxed (gasoline) at 25 cents a gallon,it wouldn't hurt our business at all. Fifty cents, people may buymore fours (cylinder engines). But a nickel or a dime won't hurt,but if it goes to 25 to 50 cents ...   I don't think people are going to stop buying cars because ofhigh fuel prices. I think they are going to worry about their jobsand the uncertainty that a recession that this Iraq situation maybring on us. That's the big problem.</TEXT><HEAD>Christopher Flavin, vice president for research and energy</HEAD><TEXT>   analyst for Worldwatch Institute, Washington D.C.:</TEXT><TEXT>   While the president used the words ``energy conservation'' asU.S. troops were on their way to the Persian Gulf, in a year and ahalf in office he has failed to propose any significant policies toreduce dependence on imported oil. Indeed, the steady rise in U.S.oil imports during the Reagan administration has continued duringthe Bush presidency.   Means are available to reverse this trend. We can make our cars,buildings and industries far more fuel-efficient than they aretoday. And we can gradually develop clean renewable fuels to runour vehicles. The ques in encouraging more oil production, indelivering less costly natural gas, and development of syntheticfuels will be governed by price considerations. So willconservation, which will be ultimately regulated by energyregulation and cost. Realistically, nuclear energy must bere-examined as a significant, expanded domestic energy source, withthe safeguards we proposed in the '70s.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 26</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
