An exchange disciplinary committee alleged that Mr. Pashkow prearranged simultaneous buying and selling orders in Sandamp;P 500 futures opposite a member firm house account during August and September 1985. Another committee found that Mr. Pashkow also prearranged the execution of certain orders in West German mark and Swiss franc futures on August 18, 1986. Prearranged trading involves arranging trades without making an offer on the exchange floor, which is required by the Merc to get the best price for each trade.    The exchange said Mr. Pashkow agreed to the disciplinary action without admitting or denying the allegation. The Merc said $10,000 of the fine will be waived if he doesn't violate exchange rules for a year following suspension.    Mr. Pashkow declined comment on the action. </TEXT></DOC>
