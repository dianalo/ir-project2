A spokesman for Lange's office said no official meetings hadbeen sought for the six-day visit that begins April 21.   Relations between the two countries have been strained since thegovernment's 1983 ban on visits by ships capable of carryingnuclear weapons. The ban led to the collapse of the ANZUS militaryalliance of Australia, New Zeland and the United States.   Opposition National Party leader Jim Bolger said Washington wasa glaring omission from Lange's itinerary, indicating the extent ofdamage caused by the anti-nuclear stance.   Lange is to deliver a foreign policy speech at Yale University,where he is to be the Hendon Fellow of Berkeley College for 1989,his spokesman said.   He also is to attend an ANZAC Day service in New York andaddress a luncheon of the Asia Society and the United States-NewZealand Council. ANZAC is an acronym for the Australia-New ZealandArmy Corps that fought the disastrous campaign at Gallipoli in 1915.   Former veterans mark the 74th anniversary of the World War Ibattle on April 25.   The announcement of Lange's visit follows Vice President DanQuayle's decision not to travel to New Zealand after a visit toAustralia next month.   Lange has said he believes New Zealand has resolved its positionwith the United States and the relationship will continue.   ``We are disposed to be cooperative with great powers and smallpowers but we will not do so at the cost of our nuclear policy,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
