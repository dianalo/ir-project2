My uncle is Alain Rocourt, the treasurer of the Provisional Election Council that attempted to hold the recent ill-fated elections. My family and I know many Haitians of all social and economic classes, both in the cities and the countryside. We have never heard of the Bizango or anything remotely resembling what you described in your editorial {as a &quot;voodoo theocracy&quot;}. The Bizango story is low-grade fiction -- a not very imaginative and mean-spirited fairy tale. If the situation in Haiti were not so tragic, your credulity would be funny.    Sadly, there is nothing funny about this story. Your editorial gives support to those who would not hold the ruling military junta responsible for the bloodshed and repression in Haiti. The forces that are at work against democracy in Haiti are not mysterious or incomprehensible. Jean-Claude Duvalier, his Tontons Macoutes and his military have been plundering the Haitian people for decades, with the tacit approval of the U.S. government, and they are not willing to give up their privileged positions without a fight. They are not helpless in the current cycle of violence; they are behind it. There is no &quot;sinister force&quot; that the junta needs U.S. support to defend itself against, unless that &quot;sinister force&quot; is the longing of the Haitian people for democracy and justice that has been denied them so long.    My family and I are amazed and disappointed that this Bizango nonsense has been given the mantle of truth and respectability by appearing on your editorial page. We hope and pray that those, both in the U.S. and Haiti, who would place the blame for the bloodshed in Haiti other than where it squarely belongs will not find succor in your gullibility, and that the Haitian people will not have to pay for it with their blood.    R. Richard Boncy   Vice President and Deputy   General Counsel   Honeywell Inc.   Minneapolis   ---   My uncle is the Rev. Alain Rocourt, chairman of the Methodist Church in Haiti, treasurer of the Electoral Council installed, pursuant to the Haitian constitution, to ensure free and democratic elections. This Electoral Council has been disbanded by the provisional government (the CNG), put in place with the help of the U.S. after Jean-Claude Duvalier was forced to flee.    The U.S. somehow ignored the fact that the security forces of Haiti -- both the army and the police -- deserted the streets to allow well-armed bands to kill, burn and terrorize to prevent the election. Only when the Haitian people took matters into their own hands and formed spontaneous self-defense groups did the armed forces reappear to attack these groups.    Every Haitian knows that stronger representations from the U.S. government could have ensured democracy in Haiti and could have prevented the massacres that caused the elections to be canceled. The U.S. government didn't fully support open, free and democratic elections in Haiti. The cancellation of economic aid to Haiti is a mere slap on the wrist to the regime that fostered the terror visited on innocent Haitian people.    Undoubtedly, elections will be held in Haiti. They now will be supervised by the regime that prevented the Haitian people from voting in elections supervised by the council created by the Haitian constitution. The votes will be counted by that regime. The results will be satisfactory to that regime. The terrorist regime will continue to control Haiti. Will the U.S. government applaud the results and support the &quot;freely elected&quot; Haitian government? The people of Haiti, and the people of all Latin America and the American people, will be watching.    What can the U.S. still do? It can begin by insisting on the reinstatement of the legally constituted Electoral Council. And it can help organize a multinational peacekeeping force from hemisphere countries to guarantee a safe and orderly transition to a democratic government.    Let me add that the house of my uncle was attacked with machine guns and grenades, provided by the U.S. government through its military-aid program (now discontinued, for the time being at least), and my uncle is in hiding. He is at least alive, but numerous Haitians are dead.    Jacqueline B. Monash   Beverly Hills, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
