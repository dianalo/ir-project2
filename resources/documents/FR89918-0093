The amendment is effective as of the date of issuance.The amendment modifies Appendix A Technical Specifications by deletingthe prohibition on disposal of the accident generated water (AGW) at theplant. In 1986 the licensee submitted a plan to dispose of the AGW by forcedevaporation and atmospheric release of the 2.3 million gallons of AGW resultingfrom the March 28, 1979, accident at TMI-2. The NRC staff updated the 1981Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) in June 1987 with thepublication of the final Supplement 3 to the PEIS dealing with disposalof the AGW.On February 25, 1987, the licensee requested a change to the TechnicalSpecifications deleting the prohibition for disposal of the AGW. This requestto amend the license was revised on April 13, 1987.The application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirementsof the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission'srules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings asrequired by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFRchapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment.Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearingin connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 31, 1987 (52 FR 28626).

On February 2, 1989, the ASLBP issued a final initial decision findingin favor of the licensee in all relevant matters and recommending thatthe requested amendment to the license be authorized. On April 13, 1989,the Commission affirmed the Licensing Board's February 3, 1989, decisionand determined that the licensee's application for an operating licenseamendment, when issued by the staff, should become effective immediately.The Commission found no reason to stay the effectiveness of the LicensingBoard's decision pending completion of the appeals process.Based upon the findings of Supplement 2 to the PEIS, the ASLBP final initialdecision and the staff's safety evaluation, the Commission has concludedthat the issuance of this amendment will not have a significant effecton the quality of the human environment.For further details with respect to the action see: (1) The applicationfor amendment dated February 25, 1987, revised April 13, 1987, (4) AmendmentNo. 35 to License No. DPR-73, which includes the NRC staff's Safety Evaluation,(2) the Commission's related evaluation of this amendment is containedin Supplement 2 to the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement datedJune 1987 and a Safety Evaluation dated September 11, 1989, and (3) theCommission's Environmental Assessment dated August 31, 1989, publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 11, 1989 (54 FR 37517).
