The report, by the MTI news agency, said Comaneci, who retiredfrom gymnastics in 1984, applied for a temporary settlement permit,valid for three days at the police station in Szeged, 15 miles fromthe Romanian border.   An earlier MTI report, which quoted Hungarian radio, had saidComaneci applied for asylum after crossing into Hungary by carbefore dawn Tuesday together with six other Romanians, who were notidentified.   She reportedly told Hungarian border guards that her escape hadbeen organized ``in advance under the guidance of a Romanian man,''the news agency said without elaboration.   The earlier report quoted her as saying she had left behind a``neatly furnished flat, a car and financial security for the sakeof freedom.''   Comaneci was quoted as saying she had been denied permission towork abroad as a coach or even travel, in spite of numerous offersand invitations. She has been planning a coaching and refereeingcareer.   An employee of the local radio station in the southern Hungarytown of Szeged said Comaneci checked into the Royal Hotel there,spent the night and left this morning. The radio station employeespoke on condition of anonymity.   An estimated 25,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarianscomplaining of discrimination, have fled to Hungary in the past twoyears seeking refuge from chronic hardships under the regime ofPresident Nicolae Ceausescu.   Comaneci, 27, an ethnic Romanian, astounded the world as apetite, solemn 14-year-old, turning in a series of perfect 10scores and winning three gold medals at the Montreal games.   Her former coach, ethnic Hungarian Bela Karoly, defected withhis wife in March 1981 while on a tour of 15 American cities withthe Romanian gymnastics team. He became a U.S. citizen last springand coaches American gymnasts.   ``I'm happy finally she made the step which would lead to a freelife, what she fully deserves,'' Karoly told The Associated Presstoday in a telephone interview from Clarens, Switzerland.   Comaneci ``is still a big personality in Romania, (and) she hasnothing against the Romanian population, but just like me she waschased out of the country by the Romanian authorities,'' Karolysaid.   Karoly said he would ``warmly and honestly'' urge her to go tothe United States. ``It is still the country with the greatestrespect for Nadia and at the same time a country still with thegreatest opportunity,'' he said.   Comaneci is listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as thefirst gymnast to receive a perfect score in a major internationaltourney. During her carreer, she collected 21 gold medals, 12 ofthem for Olympic and world titles.</TEXT></DOC>
