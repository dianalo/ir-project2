The General Assembly had been scheduled to approve $416 millionfor the U.N. peacekeeping force that will guide Namibia toindependence after 74 years of South African rule.   But the African front-line states insisted on inserting languageinto the funding resolution referring to U.N. embargos on buyingmilitary equipment, oil or other goods from South Africa.   The United States, Britain and France opposed the language,noting that Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's report tothe Security Council on Namibia said it would be necessary topurchase goods and services in southern Africa to keep down the costof the mission.   A key sticking point appeared to be where the United Nationswould purchase $10.2 million worth of gasoline and aviation fuel,diplomats said.   The two major sources for such refined products in the region areSouth Africa and Angola. Overland supply from South Africa would beeasier and less expensive.   Since 1984, however, the General Assembly has asked the SecurityCouncil to impose a mandatory oil embargo on South Africa, a measurethat Britain and the United States have vetoed.   General Assembly resolutions against South Africa are onlyadvisory; Security Council resolutions are enforceable.   In 1984, the Security Council passed a resolution calling on allstates not to buy military equipment from South Africa, which bythen had developed a flourishing arms industry with export capacity.   The African front-line diplomats were also debating Fridaywhether the U.N. plan to lease 40 mine-resistant vehicles for a yearat $656,000 would violate the embargo. Some contended that otherpurchases, such as trucks, radios and construction materials for theU.N. peacekeepers' barracks, also should be barred.   The General Assembly's budgetary committee had not resolved theissue by late Friday, a necessary step before the whole GeneralAssembly can vote for funds for the Namibia peacekeeping force.   On April 1, the United Nations intends to begin implementing aone-year plan for Namibia's independence under the supervision ofthe U.N. Transition Assistance Group.   The mission will send 4,650 military peacekeepers, 500 policesupervisors, more than 760 civilian U.N. staff, 820 locally hiredstaff and 620 election monitors to Namibia, which is also calledSouth-West Africa.   If necessary, Perez de Cuellar may dispatch a total of 7,500troops, but the initial deployment was limited as a cost-cuttingmeasure at the insistence of the United States, Soviet Union,Britain, France and China, who together pay 57 percent of allpeacekeeping costs.   South Africa has ruled Namibia since it captured the colony fromGermany during World War I.   In December, South Africa signed accords with Angola and Cubaagreeing to free Namibia if 50,000 Cuban troops stationed in Angolaare sent home by mid-1991.   Angola asked Cuba to send troops to help protect the Marxistgovernment from cross-border raids by South African troops based inNamibia, and from a rebellion by the U.S.-backed rebels of UNITA,the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola.</TEXT></DOC>
