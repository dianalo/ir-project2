Castro approaches the Jan. 1 anniversary with about 60 percentof the island's 11 million people too young to remember the fervorof his fight. But he praised the new generation for itsrevolutionary enthusiasm.   In his three-hour, nationally televised speech Tuesday night,Castro predicted hard times ahead and urged Cubans to work hard andstop dreaming of such luxuries as an eight-hour work day.   The good news in the speech marking the July 26 start of hisfive-year battle was that Cuban troops may come home from their13-year involvement in Angola.   ``We will happily receive our combatants,'' Castro said, andwelcome them back to ``the battle for development of our country.''   Castro said troops would stay there ``until the minute'' that anagreement is signed in the U.S.-mediated talks between South Africaand Cuba. He gave no time frame but said the pullout will not besudden.   Castro has never spoken so explicitly about bring Cuban troopshome.   He frequently mentioned the Jan. 1 celebration of the day hemarched into Havana 30 years ago to take power from dictatorFulgencio Batista.   He spoke at length about his communist government's progress,citing economic gains, public works and the revolution's vauntedpublic health system.   Before 1959, he said, there were 180 doctors in Santiago, thenation's largest city after Havana. Now, he said, there are 2,470.   Even more important, he said, is the fact that ``these newgenerations of Santiagans are even more enthusiastic and morerevolutionary than the generations that preceded them.''   The degree of that enthusiasm could be crucial in the comingyears of hardship Castro predicts because of bleak prospects forimprovement in the foreign exchange situation.   Just two years ago, at the third Communist Party Congress,Castro said laziness, absenteeism and inefficiency had become sucha problem that Cuba might become a nation of freeloaders.   On Tuesday, he said things have improved and the ``firstfruits'' of his rectification campaign are being seen.   But he also called for more hard work and fewer illusions andtold those yearning for an industrialized nation, where the workday is eight hours or less, that they are dreaming.   ``It's necessary to work and work hard,'' he said.``We don'timpose anything on the worker. We persuade the worker.''   The rectification campaign has moved away from economicincentives toward the kind of moral exhortation employed in theearly days of the revolution.   Castro also made it clear that he isn't going to launch anyreform campaigns like those of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``Cuba will never adopt methods, styles, philosophies oridiosyncracies of capitalism,'' he said. Capitalist systems, Castrosaid, are ``complete garbage. They're not good for anything.''   He also said there will be no move away from one-party rule.   Castro wore his standard green uniform and cap. Although hisfamous beard is turning white, he spoke with as much vigor andanimation as ever. But his image was still a sharp contrast to thepictures of the young revolutionary and his comrades preparing forthe July 26, 1958, attack on the Moncada garrison.   The attack failed. But five years and five months later, Castromarched triumphantly into Havana.</TEXT></DOC>
