But Nelson is not portraying escaped convicts, white-collarcriminals or even discredited politicians. The object of his satireis a group of Anglophile American academics and their students on ayearly marathon tour of British theater.   It's a specialized group to skewer, and if the scope of theplay, which which arrived Sunday at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater inLincoln Center, is narrow, its aim is deadly _ and delicious.   These academics from a small, unidentified American college havecome to worship at the shrines of British drama _ particularly theNational Theater in London and that holiest of holys _ the RoyalShakespeare Company's complex in Stratford-on-Avon.   Two events turn the tour into turmoil. Both problems must besolved by the chairman of the school's English department, JoeTaylor, played with a wonderful all-enveloping smugness by ColinStinton. Taylor is the kind of teacher who demands truth inliterature if not in real life.   The chairman must tell a colleague, who paid his own way over tocement his position at the school, that his contract will not berenewed. And Taylor must handle an accusation by an unstablestudent that she was molested by a teacher.   Nelson has great fun with these people as they race from play toplay to play. For them, it's quantity rather than quality thatcounts. These intrepid theatergoers seem more concerned with seatlocation, the food at intermission and how to divide the bill afterdinner than with what they are watching on stage.   Much of the evening's enjoyment comes from director RogerMichell's snappy production, cleverly designed by Alexandra Byrne.The furniture and props for the play's 11 scenes hang precariouslyabove the stage. They are pulled down when needed while a jazzcombo performs and then carted offstage when a scene ends.   Most of the other performers are up to Stinton's high standards.Particularly effective are Bob Balaban as the nerdy assistantprofessor on shaky status, John Bedford Lloyd as the pompousprofessor accused of attacking a student and Frances Conroy asanother teacher trying to conceal an affair.   Nelson's best scene occurs late in the play _ at a Pizza Hut inStratford, no less _ where the chairman and two of his professorslook at and then deny the mess they have created. It's hypocrisy atits highest and wonderfully acted by Stinton, Bedford Lloyd andConroy.   Some 30 years ago, Noel Coward wrote a wicked song called ``WhyDo the Wrong People Travel?'' for his musical ``Sail Away.'' In it,he poked fun at the ubiquitous American tourist who would have beenbetter off _ and happier _ if he had stayed home. Much the same canbe said for Nelson's motley collection of pretentious academics.</TEXT></DOC>
