By the Commission:</ITAG>1. On October 30, 1984, the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (CableAct) \1\<NOTE/> was signed into law, establishing a national policy concerningcable communications ``that clarifies the current system of local, stateand Federal regulation of cable television.'' \2\<NOTE/> In order to implement provisions of the Act, we adopted certainamendments to Parts 1, 63, and 76 of the Commission's Rules. <T3>Cable Communications Act Rules, </T3>58 RR 2d 1 (1985),  <T3>modified, </T3>104 FCC 2d 386 (1986), <T3>aff'd in part and rev'd in part sub nom. ACLU </T3>v. <T3>FCC. </T3>823 F.2d 1554 (D.C. Cir. 1987), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>108 S. Ct. 1220 (1988). The implementation of oneof our conforming rule amendments has given rise to certain questions,which lead us to issue this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Pub. L. No. 98-549, Section 1 <T3>et seq., </T3>98 Stat. 2779 (1984) (codified principally at 47 U.S.C.Sections 521-639). The Cable Act amends the Communications Act of 1934,as amended, 47 U.S.C. Section 151, by adding, <T3>inter alia, </T3>a new Title VI. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ H.R. Rep. No. 98-934, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 19 (1984).2. The Cable Act defines a cable system as ``a facility, consisting ofa set of closed transmission paths and associated signal generation, reception,and control equipment that is designed to provide cable service which includesvideo programming and which is provided to multiple subscribers withina community * * *.'' 47 U.S.C. Section 522(6). That same section also excludesfrom the definition of a cable system ``a facility that serves only subscribersin one or more multiple unit dwellings under common ownership, control,or management, unless such facility or facilities uses any public right-of-way* * *.'' 47 U.S.C. Section 522(6)(B). In adopting our implementing rules,we adopted the Act's definition and exclusions, including the one notedabove, as a conforming rule change. <T3>Cable Communications Act Rules, supra. See also</T3> 47 CFR 76.5(a).In doing so, we stated that ``[w]ith regard to the exclusion of facilitiesserving multiple unit dwellings, we will include as cable systems onlysuch facilities that use public rights-of-way.'' <T3>Cable Communications Act Rules,</T3> 58 RR 2d at 11. On reconsideration,we further stated that ``[w]hen multiple unit dwellings are involved, thedistinction between a cable system and other forms of video distributionsystems is now the crossing of the public rights-of-way, not the ownership,control or management.'' <T3>Cable Communications Act Rules (Reconsideration),</T3> 104 FCC 2d at396-397. Recent decisions by two federal district courts, however, haveraised significant questions concerning both the Commission's constructionof the multiple unit dwelling exception to the cable definition and theapplication and scope of the basic definition itself.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\  While the decisions of the district courts do not settlequestions of national communications policy, <T3>See FCC</T3> v.<T3> ITT World Communications, Inc.,</T3> 466 U.S. 463, 468-69 and n.5(1984), the potential adverse effect of disparate opinions of the districtcourts on fundamental definitional questions such as those at issue inthese cases is significant. Indeed, it was for this reason that the Commissionexpressly requested referral on primary jurisdiction grounds in <T3>City of Fargo</T3> v.<T3> Prime Time Entertainment, Inc.,</T3> No. A3-87-47 slip op. (D.N.D.Mar. 28, 1988), discussed below. The district court, however, denied ourrequest. Accordingly, to avoid these potential adverse effects and to providecertainty and uniformity in this area, we believe this rulemaking proceedingis advisable. 3. Specifically, in <T3>City of Fargo</T3> v.<T3> Prime Time Entertainment, Inc., </T3>No. A3-87-47 slip op. (D.N.D.Mar. 28, 1988), the district court found that the delivery by infraredtransmissions of video programming to multiple unit dwellings that werenot commonly owned, controlled or managed rendered the facilities involveda cable television system within the meaning of section 522(6) of the CommunicationsAct of 1934, as amended. Because cable systems are required by the Actto obtain a franchise from local authorities and the service provider inthis case, Prime Time Entertainment, Inc. (Prime), had  not done so, thecourt concluded that Prime's operations were impermissible. Accordingly,the court enjoined Prime from providing service over its existing facilitiesuntil the requisite franchise was obtained. In its decision, the courtspecifically addressed the applicability to Prime of the multiple unitdwelling exception to the cable definition. It found the exception to beunavailing in the circumstances of the case before it because the unitsserved by Prime were not commonly owned, controlled or managed.\4\<NOTE/> In reaching this determination, the court expressly rejectedthe Commission's interpretation of the section 522(6)(B) exception, notedabove. The court concluded that the Commission's disregard of the commonownership, control or management aspect of the exception and its exclusivereliance on the crossing of a public right-of-way as dispositive of theexception's applicability was erroneous ``because it contravenes unambiguousCongressional intent.''\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ As a result, the court did not reach the question of whetherthe interconnection of multiple unit dwellings by infrared transmissionsconstituted a crossing of a public right-of-way. We note, however, thatthe Mass Media Bureau, in informal opinions issued pursuant to delegatedauthority, has expressed the view that the linkage of two SMATV systemsby infrared transmissions does not constitute a crossing of a public right-of-way.<T3>See Channel One, Inc.</T3> (letter dated February 25, 1986) and Letterto Mark J. Tauber and Deborah C. Costlow (dated December 19, 1985). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>City of Fargo</T3> v.<T3> Prime Time Entertainment, Inc.,</T3> slip op. at 9. 4. Two basic aspects of the <T3>Fargo</T3> decision invite particular attention. First, the court'srejection of our construction of the multiple unit dwelling exception suggestsa clear need to revisit this area. After a preliminary review, we are inclinedto concur in the court's view that the exception is not available unlessthe multiple unit dwellings served by a video programming delivery systemare commonly owned, controlled or managed <T3>and</T3> there is no crossing of a public right-of-way involved. Commentersare welcome to propose alternative constructions of the statutory exception,but   in doing so they should carefully document their supporting arguments.Comments are also sought specifically with respect to the question of whatconstitutes a crossing of a public right-of-way, including but not limitedto the use of infrared technology. 5. Second, the possible implication in the <T3>Fargo </T3>court's decision that Prime's wireless, infrared transmissionsystem might satisfy the basic statutory definition of a cable system asa ``set of closed transmission paths and associated signal generation,reception and control equipment *** designed to provide cable service''has potentially troubling implications. We are especially concerned thatthe potential inclusion within the cable definition of a nontraditionaldelivery system such as infrared extends the definition in a manner thatmay be inappropriate and inconsistent with congressional intent. This couldpresage other possibly inapt extensions of the definition that would requirethe treatment of additional wireless video delivery systems as cable systemsas well. Indeed, in a very recent decision, another federal district courtapparently concluded that the interception of local television broadcastsignals and their national retransmission via space satellite to individualhome satellite-receive facilities constituted a cable television systemwithin the meaning of the Communications Act. <T3>Pacific andamp; Southern Co., Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Satellite Broadcast Networks, Inc., </T3>694 F. Supp. 1565 (N.D.Ga.1988).\6\<NOTE/> For purposes of the cable system definition, the serviceprovided by Satellite Broadcast Networks, Inc. (SBN), in that case is difficultto distinguish from the service proposed to be provided by Direct BroadcastSatellite (DBS) systems. DBS, like other analogous services, includingthe Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) and the Multichannel MultipointDistribution Service (MMDS), is designed to deliver video programming tomultiple subscribers in a community. Yet, it seems clear that Congressdid not intend in adopting the Cable Act to include these alternate deliverysystems within the statutory definition of a cable system. Several considerationsprompt our view in this regard. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The court reached this determination in the context offinding that, under the provisions of the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C.Section 101, <T3>et seq., </T3>Satellite Broadcasting Networks, Inc. (SBN), was notentitled to a compulsory license to distribute the broadcast signals itwas delivering to homes by satellite. The court detailed two rationalesfor its finding. First, the court concluded that SBN was ineligible fora compulsory license because only cable systems were entitled to the licenseand SBN's facilities did <T3>not </T3>meet the definition of a cable system in the Copyright Act.Second, the court noted that, under the Copyright Act, a compulsory licenseis only available with respect to signals the carriage of which is permissibleunder the rules of the FCC. The court found that SBN's service did notmeet this criterion because SBN <T3>did </T3>constitute a cable system under the definition in the CommunicationsAct and it had not obtained certain service authorizations required ofcable systems. 6. First, nowhere in the Cable Act or in its legislative history is therean affirmative statement that Congress meant to define a cable system sobroadly as to incorporate such services as MDS, MMDS, DBS or SatelliteMaster Antenna Television (SMATV). This omission is significant since sucha broad definition of a cable system represents a dramatic departure fromlongstanding and consistent Commission practice in regulating cable televisionservice.\7\<NOTE/> Ordinarily, such a radical change would be expected to promptspecific congressional comment, particularly since Congress was plainlyaware of the discrete nature of the alternative video services involvedwhen it adopted the statutory definition and appeared to anticipate theirbeing subject to a different form of regulation than cable.\8\<NOTE/> Second, the statutory scheme adopted in the Cable Act is,in many fundamental respects, entirely inappropriate for such alternativeservices as MDS and DBS. Local franchising requirements, for example, arecompletely incompatible with the national service characteristics of aDBS system.\9\<NOTE/> Finally, we believe the language of the definition itself_particularlythe requirement that a cable system consist of a ``set of closed transmissionpaths''_contemplates excluding delivery systems that exclusively or primarilyutilize ``radiating'' technology to deliver service to end users.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Until 1977, the Commission expressly defined a cable systemas a facility that delivered service by ``wire or cable,'' thereby limitingthe definition to traditional cable systems and excluding wireless technologies.<T3>See Cable Television Report and Order and Reconsideration, </T3>36FCC 2d 1, 74 (1972) (former Section 76.5(a) of the rules adopted therein).In 1977, the Commission revised the definition by substituting the term``a set of transmission paths'' for ``wire or cable.'' In doing so, however,the Commission specifically noted its intent that the new definition ``notbe interpreted to include such non-cable television broadcast station servicesas Multipoint Distribution Systems ***.'' <T3>First Report and Order </T3>in Docket No. 20561, 63 FCC 2d 956, 966(1977). This definition remained in effect, without relevant change, untiladoption of the Cable Act in 1984. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ For example, in reviewing recent developments in the homevideo industry, the Report of the House Committee on Energy and Commerceaccompanying H.R. 4103 (the House version of the Cable Act) noted that``[n]ew forms of competition to cable were initiated or began to show promiseof emerging during this period. These include the SMATV industry, multi-channelMDS, Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), subscription television, and theexplosion in home video cassette recorders.'' H.R. Rep. No. 934, 98th Cong.,2d Sess. (1984) at 22. Indeed, the House Report directly reflects Congressionalawareness of the regulatory distinctiveness of cable in expressing itsconcern for competitive balance among the different video delivery systems.In this connection, the House Report stated: [I]n adopting this legislation,the Committee is concerned that Federal law not provide the cable industrywith an unfair competitive advantage in the delivery of video programming.National communications policy has promoted the growth and developmentof alternative delivery systems for these services, such as DBS, SMATVand subscription television. The public interest is served by this competition,and it should continue. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ We also note that the dual, federal-local jurisdictionalapproach to regulating cable television service_a central component ofthe statutory scheme_is largely premised on the fact that cable systemsnecessarily involve extensive physical facilities and substantial constructionand use of public rights of way in the communities they serve. Yet, thesedistinctive traits are absent in the alternative delivery systems. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><T3>Id. </T3>at 22-23. 7. In view of the foregoing analysis, we seek comment concerning the properscope and application of the cable system definition contained in section522(6) of the Act and whether, and in what manner, we should amend ourrules or existing interpretations of our rules to properly reflect thestatutory definition. We are particularly concerned that delivery systemsapparently not intended to be included within the definition_such as SMATV,DBS, MDS, MMDS and leased uses of Instructional Television Fixed Service(ITFS) channels_not fall within the ambit of any interpretation or definitionwe may eventually adopt. In this connection, we specifically request thatcommenters address whether existing language in the definition_for example,the requirement that a cable system be comprised of a ``set of closed transmissionpaths''_adequately distinguishes traditional cable systems from alternativevideo delivery services.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Initial Analysis </ITAG>8. <T3>Reason for action. </T3>This action is taken to implement certain provisionsof the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984. 9. <T3>Legal basis. </T3>Authority for action as proposed for this rulemakingis contained in section 4(i) and section 303 of the Communications Actof 1934, as amended. 10. <T3>Description, potential impact and number of small entities affected.</T3>The Commission seeks comment in this proceeding on two basic issuesrelated to the definition of a cable television system in the CommunicationsAct. First, noting the decision in <T3>City of Fargo </T3>v. <T3>Prime Time Entertainment, Inc., </T3>No. A3-87-47 (D.N.D. Mar. 28,1988), in which the district court found the Commission's broad constructionof the multiple unit dwelling exception to the cable definition to be erroneous,the Commission invites comment on the appropriate interpretation of theexception. In this regard, the Commission expressed its preliminary concurrencein the court's opinion. Under the court's view of the exception, a facilityotherwise qualified as a cable system under the basic definition wouldbe excluded from the definition only if it both (a) exclusively servesmultiple unit dwellings under common ownership, management or control <T3>and </T3>(b) the facility does not cross any public right-of-way. Ifthis view is ultimately adopted by the Commission, some small entitiesmight be considered cable television systems that were previously deemedexempt. This reclassification could result in substantial burdens for theaffected entities, including a requirement that a franchise be obtainedand adherence to Commission rules and statutory requirements for cablesystems. Second, the Commission notes its concern that the <T3>Fargo </T3>decision could be read to imply that a video delivery systemthat used primarily a technology other than wire or cable in providingits services could nonetheless be a cable system under the CommunicationsAct. The Commission questions whether such a broad interpretation of thedefinition_and that of a second district court which found the direct-to-homedelivery of broadcast signals via satellite to constitute a cable system_areconsistent with the statutory language in the Act and congressional intentunderlying that language. Accordingly, the Commission invites comment onthe appropriate scope and application of the basic cable definition. Adoptionof the broad view of the definition could result in certain entities notnow deemed to be cable systems, including DBS, MDS, MMDS and SMATV systems,being considered cable systems. As already noted in connection with thescope of the exception to the definition, this would result in the applicationof various regulatory and statutory requirements to these systems, andthe imposition of corresponding burdens, which have not been heretoforeapplied.11. <T3>Recording, record keeping and other compliance requirements: </T3>None.12. <T3>Federal rules which overlap, duplicate or conflict with this rule:</T3>None.13. <T3>Any significant alternatives minimizing impact on small entities andconsistent with stated objectives by the Act: </T3>None.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Implications</ITAG>14.
