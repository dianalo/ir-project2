Defects in the gene cause a disease called Type II Ushersyndrome, which is marked by retinitis pigmentosa and moderatehearing impairment, according to an announcement Monday by theNational Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation in Baltimore.   The foundation said the disorder afflicts an estimated 10,000Americans.   ``This finding represents the first localization of a geneassociated with congenital hearing loss and is a significantadvance in the molecular genetics of RP,'' said Dr. Alan Laties,chairman of the retinitis pigmentosa foundation's scientificadvisory board.   The discovery follows by less than a month the announcement thatresearchers had identified a genetic defect associated with anotherform of retinitis pigmentosa, the so-called autosomal dominantform. That form is not accompanied by hearing loss.   The team that made the discovery was led by William Kimberling,director of the Center for Hereditary Communication Disorders atBoys Town National Research Hospital in Omaha, Neb.   The gene was found to be located on the long arm of chromosome1, one of the 23 chromosomes that carry human hereditarycharacteristics.   Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited disease that afflicts about100,000 Americans. It begins with night blindness and graduallyprogresses to tunnel vision and total blindness. These symptoms arecaused by degeneration of the retina.   The cause of this degeneration is unknown. But with thediscovery of genes that trigger it, researchers can begin tounravel the biochemical process that leads to the degeneration.They can then use that knowledge to try to develop drugs or othertreatments to counteract or prevent degeneration.</TEXT></DOC>
