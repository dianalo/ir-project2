Saunders</HL><DATE>03/27/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14</SO><IN>ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)</IN><LP>   No doubt, California's new governor, Pete Wilson, would behaving an easier time promoting his budget package and itsproposed cuts in the nation's second highest state welfarepayments if he had not made a certain gaffe in January.That's when he said his proposed cuts -- generally by 8.8% --would mean welfare moms would have &quot;less for a six-pack ofbeer.&quot;   Placing limits on welfare payments has an appeal tohard-pressed taxpayers around the country. And withCalifornia facing a $10 billion budget gap over the next 15months, there should be a growing constituency behind thisbid to reduce spending by $225 million. But welfare has itsboosters, who quickly seized on the beer gaffe as a sign ofMr. Wilson's lack of good will. What they haven't been quickto point out, however, is that Gov. Wilson would offset hisproposed cuts in a way that would allow recipients to bringhome more each month and would start them on the road awayfrom government dependency.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Wilson's budget would allow recipients to receive thesame spendable income by working approximately a half-dayeach week -- and then it would increase their food stampallotment. They wouldn't lose a dime; in fact, they'd comeout ahead.   With state benefits second only to Alaska, California'swelfare rolls have been swelling. Caseloads grew faster thanstate population during the 1980s -- and three times greaterthan the national average. California's 1988 dependency ratewas 25% greater than the national rate.   Last August, a Golden State recipient with two dependentchildren received $694 a month in Aid to Families withDependent Children-Family Group payments, compared with $577in New York City and $184 in Texas. That family also got $68in food stamps, as well as MediCal (worth about $75 per monthper family member, according to Terry Parker of theCalifornia Department of Finance), and housing and energysubsidies.   Mr. Wilson has proposed cutting that family's monthlygrant to $633 from $694, but the recipient could work to makeup the $61 difference. (In the past, such earnings would beoffset by a reduction in the AFDC grant.) In addition, thegovernor has proposed increasing that family's food stampallotment by $19. Even after his plan took effect, CaliforniaAFDC benefits would be the nation's third highest. (Vermontwould move into second place.)   The governor's plan is, in part, an element of hispreventive approach to government. The Wilson budget includesmany changes that would funnel money to areas, such asperinatal care, that should bring long-term reductions inspending. But another Wilson goal is to reduce what has beena relentless swelling in the state's welfare rolls. From 1979to 1989, the rate of government dependency nationwide droppedto 6.1% from 6.5%. In California, it remained constant -- at8.8%.   Despite what was a vibrant economy, California has seenits AFDC caseload plow ahead with the momentum of a runawaytrain. Since the enactment of the Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act of 1981, which reduced work incentives,the historic pattern of high employment reducing governmentdependency has ended; the growth in welfare dependency hasbeen completely resistant to economic expansion and lowunemployment.   Last year the Legislative Analyst, a nonpartisan adjunctto the Legislature, estimated that in 1990-91, &quot;thedependency rate will be at its highest level since 1967-77 atthe same time the unemployment rate is at its lowest duringthe 19-year period shown.&quot; That was written in rosier times,when this year's caseload growth was expected to be about4.5%. Now, with a sluggish economy, it expects caseloads togrow by 6% to 9.2% this year.   One culprit seems to be an alarming rise in the number ofbirths to teen-age and unmarried mothers -- up 32.3% from1980 to 1988. An April 1990 Department of Social Servicesstudy found that 42% of AFDC applicants had never beenmarried. Another factor is a sizable legal and illegalimmigrant population.   But also, there has been a lengthening of the average stayon AFDC. In 1981, the median total months of aid for AFDChouseholds was 32 months; by 1986 (the latest year for whichdata are available) it was 39 months. According to the stateHealth and Welfare Agency, one in five AFDC recipients hasbeen receiving grants for three years or more. Of those wholeave AFDC, 40% are back within a year. As Deputy SecretaryKim Belshe noted in an interview last month, &quot;The bulk {ofAFDC grants} are going to the folks who are on for year afteryear after year.&quot;   A paper released last month by the Legislative Analystconcluded that the grant structure &quot;offers little incentivefor recipients to work.&quot; While that analysis is blind to thelong-term advantages of getting a job, it does pinpoint theproblem in a system laden with disincentives to earn moremoney. A recipient who earns $600, for example, would beworse off earning $800 in the short term -- as grants andother benefits would be reduced or shut off.   The Wilson proposal, on the other hand, would penalizepeople who don't work at all. Since AFDC recipients who workare twice as likely to get off welfare, everyone stands togain. As Ms. Belshe has noted, 51% of California's singlemothers with children under 18 work; only 6% of AFDC singlemothers with dependent children work. Mr. Wilson's idea is tomove the government-dependent off welfare -- and on to abetter life.   ---   Ms. Saunders is an editorial writer and columnist for theLos Angeles Daily News.</TEXT></DOC>
