The board of the powerful IG Metall union is slated tomeet tomorrow to formally approve the motion for a strike byits 110,000 steelworkers and set a date for the walkout.Unless a last-minute solution to a contract impasse isreached, German steelmakers and their customers could facedisruptions soon after a strike begins.</LP><TEXT>   Volkswagen AG, for example, could face productionstandstills within a few days if strikes are widespread, andthe company's workers have been alerted that they could beput on short schedules in the coming weeks. The Mercedes-BenzAG unit of Daimler-Benz AG said that it has only about fivedays of steel reserves on hand at its huge Sindelfingenfactory in southern Germany.   Similar production bottlenecks would plague a variety ofother steel-dependent industries, such as machine-toolproducers and engineering companies.   Those close to the negotiations say that chances for aquick solution will diminish once a walkout begins, as 10failed rounds of negotiations over the past four months haveleft both sides embittered. The results of a unionwide votemade public Friday showed that 86.8% of the IG Metallmembership supported the strike motion.   Although the last round of pay talks broke off with thetwo sides only a percentage point apart on the salaryincrease, Peter-Ulrich Schmithals, chairman of the steelemployers' negotiating group, has asserted that no new offerwould be made to try to avert a strike.   For the steel industry, the wage battle comes at a timewhen the global market is suffering from collapsing prices,overcapacity and weak demand. Industry analysts estimate thatevery percentage-point increase in wages costs the Germansteel industry an additional 90 million marks to 100 millionmarks ($56 million to $62 million) a year.   The industry has asserted that it is in a battle toprevent an erosion of its competitive position world-wide.Politicians and economists also have joined the fray, warningthat wage increases much over 5% could accelerate inflationand threaten the stability of Germany's economy.   If a strike drags on, steel producers run the risk oflosing their market share as stranded customers are forced toseek alternative suppliers. With oversupply glutting themarket, other European steelmakers, as well as U.S. or Asianmanufacturers, will be more than happy to fill the gap, notedRichard Schramm, steel and engineering analyst at Trinkaus andamp;Burkhardt in Dusseldorf.   Union officials, who initially sought a 10.5% raise, saidthey would have been willing to agree to a 6.7% increase.Industry sources assert that even a 6.2% rise would have beenaccepted, but steelmakers made a final offer of an effectiveraise of 5.7%.   &quot;It's no longer just about wages, but about honor,&quot; saidLorenz Brockhues, head of IG Metall's negotiators. Theindustry has had ample time for offers and counteroffers, butinstead has forced the union into this fight, Mr. Brockhuessaid.   A walkout would be its first in 13 years.   Some on the side of the industry point to a recent studyby the Employers Association of the Steel and Iron Industrythat showed a German steelworker worked 1,481 hours in 1990,compared with 2,092 hours clocked by a Japanese steelworker.The German earned 43.12 marks ($26.75) an hour and hisJapanese counterpart the equivalent of 35.11 marks.   Steelworkers, however, say they are looking only to catchup with the wages of other German metalworkers.   Even if a strike turns the screws tight enough to winsteelworkers a raise of 6% or more, it could prove ashort-lived victory. An inexorable drive to shrink theindustry's work force is under way all over the industry. Theplanned merger of Fried. Krupp G.m.b.H. and Hoesch AG couldlead to the elimination of as many as 10,000 jobs. Thyssenalso has plans to trim up to 10,000 jobs.   It's the same outside Germany. In France last week,steelmaker Usinor Sacilor posted a 3.1 billion franc ($563million) loss for 1991, partly related to restructuring plansthat will slash up to 8,000 jobs in the next three years. TheU.S.'s second-largest steel producer, Bethlehem Steel Corp.,last week announced cuts of 6,500 jobs.   The German steelworkers' contract expired at the end ofOctober.</TEXT></DOC>
