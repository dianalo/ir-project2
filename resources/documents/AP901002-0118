Hugh Scott Honored For 90th Birthday</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Senate Republican leader Hugh Scottreturned to the Capitol Tuesday as he approaches his 90th birthdayto be honored by senators in a reception room that bears his name.   Scott, who represented Pennsylvania in the Senate for 18 years,was given a plaque, a birthday cake and a book on Chinese art. Anart collector, he has written a book on art in the Tang Dynasty.   ``There's Sen. Scott, in the middle again,'' said Sen. JohnHeinz, R-Pa., as Scott's wheelchair was encircled by RepublicanLeader Robert Dole, R-Kan., and by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., Paul Simon, D-Ill., and John Danforth,R-Mo.   Scott turns 90 on Nov. 11, but his former colleagues arecelebrating now because the Senate will be in recess on that date.   Scott was presented a framed, Senate-passed resolution extendingthe chamber's ``best wishes.'' Then, a dozen senators sang ``HappyBirthday'' and several shouted ``hip, hip hooray!''   On the wall was a portrait of Scott with his trademark pipe andwalrus-like mustache.</TEXT></DOC>
