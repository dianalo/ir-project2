(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A suspended rural county judge Tuesdaytook the stand to deny public corruption charges against him in theelegant courthouse prosecutors say he ruled like a monarch.   Cambria County President Judge Joseph F. O'Kicki spent 5{ hoursdisputing testimony from prosecution witnesses, includingallegations he twice wore only bikini underwear in his chambers andonce touched a secretary's breasts.   ``That did not happen,'' O'Kicki said, denying the testimony oftwo secretaries who said that on separate occasions he called theminto his office while he was wearing only his briefs.   O'Kicki, 59, faces a total of 10 charges for alleged violationsspanning more than a decade, including bribery, extortion, coercionand open lewdness.   Asked Tuesday about an alleged attempt to get a kickback from aJohnstown attorney after O'Kicki gave a favorable verdict, thejudge said he was joking.   ``I said, `Judges would not need a raise if commissions weregiven for the verdict just reached. He laughed and I laughed,'''O'Kicki said.   O'Kicki, 59, said he was lobbying state lawmakers at the timefor a pay raise for judges on behalf of the Pennsylvania Conferenceof State Trial Court Judges.   The charges against him span more than a decade.   Northhampton County Judge Richard Grifo, who is presiding overthe trial that began Nov. 7, said last week he expected the case togo to the 12-member jury on Thursday night.   Among the charges O'Kicki denied were:   _ Pressuring Laurel Bank to lower the interest rate on a loan inreturn for favorable treatment in a case before the judge.   _ Offering to put up money for a handyman he had hired to bid atan auction on an estate under the judge's jurisdiction.   _ Forcing court employees to act as his chauffeur and chop woodat his home as part of their jobs.   _ Asking a staffer to give him $500 for a job promotion, whichwas never offered.   _ Threatening East Taylor Municipal Authority Manager RalphHorner with jail if he did not return water service to an illegallyinstalled line on a property the judge owned.   If convicted on all the charges, O'Kicki faces up to 38 years inprison and $85,000 in fines. If acquitted, O'Kicki said he expectedto be reinstated to the bench.   The state Supreme Court suspended O'Kicki in October 1988. Hewas indicted in March.</TEXT></DOC>
