The regulations, adopted in September 1987, weren't implemented because of court challenges by the insurance industry. They were designed to bar insurers from testing for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome except for life and total disability policies with a face amount of more than $100,000.    The industry sued to block the regulations by, among other things, challenging Insurance Commissioner Roger Singer's right to issue such regulations without a legislative vote. The court noted that its decision was based on the question of the commissioner's authority and not on &quot;the substantive merits&quot; of the AIDS testing regulations or &quot;with the need for their adoption.&quot;    In their ruling, the justices said, &quot;It is now for the Legislature to decide what, if any, authority it will give the commissioner to regulate the underwriting practices of life, health and accident insurers.&quot;    William Carroll, president of the Life Insurance Association of Massachusetts, a trade association that was among those that appealed the regulations, said he was pleased with the court's decision.    &quot;We feel that we need to be able to apply the same underwriting standards to all insurance applications and all policy holders because that is fair, and the court decision today enables us to continue to do that,&quot; Mr. Carroll said.    Peter Rice, first deputy commissioner of insurance, said the ruling means &quot;testing is permitted and we can't prohibit it.&quot; But, he added, &quot;We can try and make sure that tests are done in such a way as to not adversely impact people.&quot; Mr. Rice added that the commission is considering its options under existing laws governing its authority and intends to issue new regulations involving AIDS testing that will address the issues of confidentiality, informed consent and protection against improper disclosure. </TEXT></DOC>
