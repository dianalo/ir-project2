Lobbyist Lewis Dischner and businessman Carl Mathisen also willforfeit more than $11 million as a result of their convictionsearlier this year on extortion, racketeering and fraud charges.   The advisers to former North Slope Borough Mayor Eugene Browerpocketed millions in kickbacks and sent construction contracts tocompanies they secretly owned, prosecutors said. The constructionprogram was aimed at providing 20th century comforts for thenation's northernmost communities.   ``Any mistakes I've made, I'm really sorry,'' Dischner saidWednesday before he was sentenced. ``I hope I haven't hurtanybody.''   Mathisen stopped short of apologizing, saying, ``If they (thejury) were right and I was wrong, then I'm truly sorry.''   Former Alaska U.S. Attorney Mike Spaan urged U.S. District JudgeJames Fitzgerald to sentence each defendant to 15 years in prison.He said the stiff sentence might deter other would-be white-collarcriminals.   Spaan said he was pleased with the sentences, adding, ``I thinkthe judge tempered the sentence with mercy.''   Dischner's lawyer, Douglas Pope, had asked that his 71-year-oldclient receive a three-year sentence, to be served at aminimum-security prison.   ``A 15-year sentence, as we all know, and we should not kidourselves, is a death sentence for Lewis Dischner,'' he said.   Laurence Finegold, Mathisen's lawyer, asked that his clientreceive probation because of his poor health, or that he serve histerm at his home.   But Fitzgerald said he considered Dischner's age and Mathisen'smedical condition, which includes a heart ailment and ulcers, whenfashioning their sentences. He recommended that the two serve theirterms in a minimum-security prison.   He said he did not order restitution because it would have costthe government too much and taken too long to determine how muchthe two owed the borough. The judge said the borough could pursuepayment through the courts.   Dischner, a Democratic activist and labor commissioner in formerGov. Bill Egan's administration, was convicted May 22 on 21 counts,including racketeering, extortion, and wire and mail fraud. Thejury acquitted him on four income tax counts.   Mathisen, 56, a businessman with close ties to the North Slopedating back to the early 1970s, was convicted on 22 counts.   Dischner and Mathisen each received seven years on a pair ofracketeering and racketeering conspiracy counts, and five yearseach on the other counts. Fitzgerald ordered all terms to runconcurrently.   The federal racketeering statute under which the two wereconvicted allows the government to seek forfeiture of money andproperty obtained illegally. That would require a second trial, butthe two waived their right to another day in court.   Dischner agreed to forfeit $5.8 million; Mathisen $5.7 million.   Prosecutors said Dischner and Mathisen used lavish gifts tomanipulate Brower, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion in exchangefor his testimony. Brower was sentenced to 30 days in jail andfined $5,000.   Prosecutors said payments to Dischner and Mathisen added $73million to the Minnesota-sized borough's billion-dollar buildingboom. They said the two men pocketed $21 million while Brower wasmayor from 1981 to 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
