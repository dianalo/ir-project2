Reagan administration sources said Friday that Honduras hadasked for U.S. help in transporting the troops to the border area.The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the requestfor helicopter support would probably be approved.   Honduras said the Nicaraguans crossed the border in pursuit ofU.S.-backed Contra rebels, and a ranking officer said Friday thatabout 1,000 of the soldiers remained on Honduran territory.   At a news conference Friday, Azcona said the U.S. deployment ofmore than 3,000 troops in Honduras was a warning and he would askfor more U.S. help if the leftist Nicaraguan government didn'twithdraw its troops.   The U.S. Embassy said about 800 American paratroopers, the lastof the 3,200 troops sent to Honduras, were dropped onto Palmerolaair base Friday. The Defense Department says the troops will be inCentral America about 10 days.   Azcona said his own troops will keep bombing Sandinistapositions if the Nicaraguans do not withdraw.   ``We are preparing an operation to bomb inside Honduranterritory,'' he said the day after an air raid in the Bocay region.   Azcona said he decided to ask for U.S. troops because theirarrival would be ``spectacular.'' He said he expected the ``simplepresence and immediate response'' of U.S. troops would scare theSandinista troops into withdrawing.   The United States helped Honduras move troops to the border inDecember 1986, after Nicaraguan forces attacked Contra rebel campsin Honduras. Forty U.S. helicopters transported 700 Honduransoldiers to the front. No Americans were involved in combat.   The Reagan administration sources said that if the request forhelicopter support was granted, U.S. personnel would stay away fromany fighting.   Nicaragua has denied its troops entered Honduras, but aNicaraguan military source indicated Friday that they had.   The 60-year-old Azcona said Honduran infantry was moving intothe mountainous Bocay region and should be in position by Saturday.   ``We're acting with complete calm. The Sandinistas only have toleave our territory,'' Azcona told a news conference.   The Honduran officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidtwo infantry battalions totaling from 1,600 to 2,000 soldiers weremoving in from a base at Juticalpa, about 90 miles west of Bocay.He said warplanes were on call from Tamara air base 15 miles northof Tegucigalpa.   The officer said soldiers had orders to expel ``invadingtroops'' by whatever means necessary, adding that about half theoriginal force had fled back to Nicaragua and about 1,000 remained.   He said the remaining Sandinista troops were spread over an areaabout 40 miles square.   Pentagon officials said privately the four U.S. battalions fromthe 82nd Airborne and 7th Light Infantry would spend eight or ninedays training with Hondurans in different parts of the country.   One battalion of the 82nd Airborne will be at Juticalpa, oneofficial said, ``but anyone who knows the country'' would realizethe 90 miles ``might as well be 4,000. There's nothing butmountains and jungle in between.''   ``The basic order that these troops aren't to get near thefighting still stands,'' he said.   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua said Thursday his soldierswere ready to ``combat and liquidate'' the 82nd Airborne and wouldcontinue the offensive against Contra rebels in an area reachingfrom central Nicaragua to the border.   Alejandro Bendana, secretary-general of Nicaragua's ForeignMinistry, said ``one step ... could lead to another'' in the borderconflict, indicating war might result.   The Contras have had secret bases in Honduras from which toattack across the border in their 6-year-old battle with theSandinistas.   Nicaragua's northern military headquarters is in San Andres deBocay near the frontier and Honduran warplanes flew raids in thearea Thursday, hours after U.S. troops began arriving.   Azcona said the planes fired rockets on a dirt airstrip inHonduras ``used by Nicaraguan helicopters.'' He would not confirmU.S. reports that a Soviet-made helicopter was destroyed. TheSandinistas denied it.   Reporters flown from Nicaragua to San Andres de Bocay saw twounidentified jets fly in from Honduras Thursday and drop at leastfive bombs near the border.</TEXT></DOC>
