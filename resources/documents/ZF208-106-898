(industryassociations and semiconductor plan for dynamic random-accessmemory chip production)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Naegele, Tobias.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>US industry associations and individual US semiconductor vendorsannounce efforts to implement US-based dynamic random-accessmemory (DRAM) integrated circuit (IC) production.andP;  TheSemiconductor Industry Assn and the American Electronics Assnannounce efforts to encourage US alliances for DRAM production.andO;Commitment to such a venture, though, requires a substantialinvestment, as a new 1M-bit DRAM fabrication (fab) facility costs$250 million and a 4M-bit fab costs $350 million.andP;  Individualsemiconductor firms making a new or larger investment to DRAMproduction include Motorola Inc, startup Alliance SemiconductorCorp, Micron Technology Corp and Texas Instruments (TI).andP;  Micronand TI are adding DRAM capacity.andP;  Motorola has opened 1M-bit fabsin Arizona and East Kilbride, Scotland, while Alliance will begin1M-bit DRAM production in the 2nd half of 1989.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     DRAMProductionManufacturingTrendsGoals and ObjectivesSemiconductor industryManufacturersTrade and Professional AssociationsIndustry Analysis.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
