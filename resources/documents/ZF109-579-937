said Art Olbert,IBM's enterprise systems director of client-server computing, in a preparedstatement.andM;IBM is expanding its &quot;reach and range,&quot; says John McElroy, IBM's director ofLAN communication systems.andP;  The enhancements and additions allow MIS tomanage networks from above and below.andM;IBM's announced client-server computing products to improve networkmanagement, connectivity, efficiency, and services.andP;  For improved management,IBM announced version 2.0 of NetView, LAN Network Manager versions 1.0 and1.1, LAN Station Manager, the 8230 Controlled Access Unit, and the Enhanced8209 Ethernet Attachment Module.andP;  Lastly, to improve the flexibility andefficiency of LAN-to-LAN connections, IBM announced the LAN-to-WAN Wide AreaNetwork Program, the 8209 Token Ring Attachment Module, and the LANAsynchronous Connection Server 1.0.andP;  The new Workstation Data SaveFacility/VM can be used for workstation backup to VM systems.andP;  The announcedSAA Delivery Manager will be used for software distribution between hosts andworkstations.andP;  IBM also announced new versions VTAM and significantlyenhanced the 3172, 3174, and 3475 controller family to make links betweenworkstations and host more efficient.andM;IBM has enhanced and renamed LAN Manager, its Token Ring management software.andO;IBM announced version 1.0 and 1.1 of the LAN Network Manager.andP;  ThisPresentation Manager software inventories, tracks, and controls access tonetworked devices.andP;  Using LAN Network Manager's configuration table, anadministrator can discover what devices are attached to a network, thendecide if the device is malfunctioning or unauthorized, and remove it ifnecessary.andP;  LAN Network Manager operates either locally or in conjunctionwith NetView.andM;Unlike with its predecessor LAN Manager, alerts can be filtered, whichreduces the volume of traffic forwarded over SNA to NetView.andP;  Users can QueryLanguage (SQL) commands.andP;  End-user companies can write customized networkmanagement applications using the OS/2 relational database.andM;In the next release, IBM will support 80 NetView commands, a great leapbeyond the 12 commands supported in version 1.0 Version 1.1 will also enablethe administrator to automate LAN Network Manager commands.andP;  Physical designand configuration and asset management information will be included.andP;  LANNetwork Manager version 1.0 will be available in April 1991.andP;  LAN NetworkManager Entry will be available in December 1991.andM;LAN Network Manager Entry works in conjunction with NetView.andP;  Itsfunctionality is similar to LAN Network Manager version 1.1, but it lacks alocal operator interface.andP;  This is a cost-effective solution when localadministration is not needed.andM;The LAN Station Manager reports configuration and asset information to LANNetwork Manager.andP;  The LAN Station Manager runs in DOS or OS/2 workstationsand provides information such as the adapter type, the room the device islocated in, and the time of day it is permitted on the ring.andP;  It also allowsthe LAN Network Manager set station configuration values.andP;  When available inDecember 1991, it will support ISO's  Common Management Interface Protocol(CMIP).andM;IBM is also extending its reach into the enterprise network.andP;  Connectivityannouncements included new wiring hubs, bridges, communication servers, andcluster controllers.andM;Bringing its Multistation Access Unit (MAU) on par with third-party TokenRing vendors, IBM debuted an intelligent repeater and MAU, called the 8230Token Ring Controlled Access Unit (CAU).andP;  The CAU can identify and isolate amalfunctioning node, automatically recover, or remove and bypass the failingcomponent.andP;  The NetView operator is notified of problems through the LANNetwork Manager.andM;The CAU supports shielded and unshielded twisted-pair (STP, UTP) andfiber-optic cabling.andP;  It also supports greater cabling distances than thenon-intelligent 8228 MAU.andP;  At 4Mbps and 16Mbps using STP, the maximumdisances are 375 meters and 145 meters, respectively.andP;  If using UTP, 100meters is the maximum distance between the device and the MAU.andP;  IBM CablingSystem connectors and RJ-45 connectors can be intermixed.andM;This modular, rack-mounted unit supports up to 80 LAN-attached devices, inincrements of 20 attachments.andP;  LEDs have been added to the CAU, as well as atwo-character hexadecimal error code, which provides power status, wrapstate, 8230 status, and insertion state of each lobe attachment.andP;  Plannedavailability is March 1991.andM;The LAN-to-LAN WAN Program allows users to link remote NetBIOS networks overan SNA or X.15 backbone.andP;  &quot;No changes are required on the network,&quot; saysMcElroy.andP;  Up to 48 simultaneous sessions are supported.andP;  Full APPC(LU6.2/PU2.1) is supported for cooperative processing applications.andP;  TheLAN-to-LAN WAN Program supports Token Ring, PC Network, and Ethernet.andP;  Itwill be available starting in April 1991.andM;For increased performance, IBM announced the 8209 Token Ring Bridge, ahardware and software bridge that works with 4Mbps and 16Mbps networks.andP;  The8209 Ethernet Attachment Module has been improved to let LAN Network Managermanage Token Ring networks connected through an Ethernet.andM;LAN Asynchronous Connection Server (LANACS) allows DOS and OS/2 workstationsemulating ASCII terminals access to TCP/IP hosts.andP;  LANACS now operates onEthernet, as well as Token Ring and PC Network.andP;  It will be available inDecember 1990.andM;IBM also added the 3172 Interconnect Controller Model 2 to its line ofcontrollers.andP;  The company's first Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)product, the 3172 attaches multiple LANs to multiple hosts.andP;  It employs thenew System/390's Enterprise Systems Connection Architecture (ESCON) fortransmitting data between hosts using high-speed lines.andP;  The high speed willenable LANs and hosts to share more data more quickly.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
