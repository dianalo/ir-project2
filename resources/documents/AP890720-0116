The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said the White Housescience adviser should oversee efforts to help protect the network,Internet, from sabotage.   In a report, the agency said lax security procedures on Internetcontributed to the severity of problems that resulted when asoftware virus ``infected'' the system last November, cripplingthousands of computers.   Internet, the main computer network used by the U.S. researchcommunity, comprises more than 500 national, regional and localnetworks nationwide and overseas handling unclassified information.Two of the largest component networks are sponsored by thePentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and theNational Science Foundation.   The GAO report was released at a hearing of the House Energy andCommerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance.   Jack L. Brock Jr., director of the GAO's government informationand financial management division, told the panel that since thevirus attack last fall, security has been strengthened on manycomputers connected to Internet.   However, ``we still feel that the lack of central control (oversecurity) ... remains a problem,'' he testified.   Rep. Edward J. Markey J. Markey, D-Mass, chairman of thesubcommittee, asked Brock whether Internet was still vulnerable tocomputer viruses and other types of software sabotage.   The GAO official responded: ``Sure ... No open system can ever becompletely secure.''   Computer viruses are generally small strings of computer codesthat can infiltrate software programs and replicate themselvesthousands of times, causing computer systems to ``crash.'' In somecases, they can surreptitiously alter or destroy computer data.   Also testifying at the hearing was John Landry, appearing onbehalf of ADAPSO, the Computer Software and Services IndustryAssociation.   He noted that ``virus attacks can be life-threatening. Recently acomputer used in real-time control of a medical experiment wasattacked. If the attack had not been detected, a patient might havebeen injured or worse.''   ``The risk of loss of life resulting from infections of airlinetraffic control or nuclear plant monitoring systems is easilyimaginable,'' said Landry, executive vice president of CullinetSoftware Inc., Westwood, Mass.   The GAO report noted that currently, ``there is no lead agency ororganization responsible for Internet-wide management.Responsiblility for computer security rests largely with the hostsites that own and operate the computers.''   To help ensure needed security improvements, the GAO recommendedthat the president's science adviser, through the White House Officeof Science and Technology Policy, ``coordinate the establishment ofan interagency group ... to serve as the Internet security focalpoint.''   It said this group should:   _Provide Internet-wide security policy, direction andcoordination.   _Support continuing efforts to enhance Internet security.   _Obtain the involvement of Internet users, software vendors,technical advisory groups, and federal agencies regarding securityissues.   _Become an integral part of the structure that emerges to managea high-speed National Research Network planned for the 1990s.</TEXT></DOC>
