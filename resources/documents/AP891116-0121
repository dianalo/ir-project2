The bill was passed 252-174 and sent to the Senate after adebate sprinkled withreferences to the fact that voting for payraises was a politically sensitive proposition.   House members now make $89,500 a year. Under the new bill, theywould make more than $120,000 within less than 14 months.   ``We've decided to reinvest in this institution and take theresponsibility for its future,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif.,co-chairman of the task force that drafted the legislation.   ``This is a little like root canal work without the anesthesia.It's painful, but it needs to be done,'' said Rep. Thomas Downey,D-N.Y.   But Rep. James A. Traficant, D-Ohio, argued against thelegislation.   ``I understand the game _ we come with ethics reform and wesneak in a pay raise,'' Traficant said. ``Now is not that time,''he said, citing huge budget and trade deficits. ``You're notrewarded for losing.''   The package, introduced Wednesday by House Speaker Thomas S.Foley, D-Wash., had strong bipartisan support and the backing ofPresident Bush.   ``This is truly an ethics package,'' said House Minority WhipNewt Gingrich, R-Ga., citing a series of reforms that wouldaccompany the salary increases spread over the next 14 months.   The plan does not include a raise for the Senate, where MajorityLeader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said lawmakers might go for a moregradual pay plan and elimination of honoraria. The issue will comeup Friday, he said today.   Under the plan, House members, federal judges and top executivebranch officials would receive 7.9 percent in cost of living raisesby January, making up for inflation since the last congressionalpay raise in early 1987.   On Jan. 1, 1991, those officials would receive anotheras-yet-undetermined cost of living increase _ whatever rank andfile civil servants are given then _ plus a 25 percent pay boost.At that time, new rules would require House members to stoppocketing money from speeches and limit other outside earned incometo 15 percent of their congressional salaries.   The total pay increase would be about 35 percent if there was no1991 cost of living raise. If it followed the pattern of theprevious two years _ 4.1 percent and 3.6 percent _ the pay raisewould be closer to 40 percent with salaries reaching about $125,000.   The long-awaited package was unveiled Wednesday by the jointHouse leadership just as Bush was sending a letter to Capitol Hillgiving it his blessing.   ``In my view, the bill would effect a tremendous change in thelandscape of government ethics standards,'' the president said.   Leaders appeared confident the Senate will approve the raisesfor the House and other officials, although that scenario wouldrepeat a situation that existed seven years ago when, for about sixmonths, the House was paid more than the Senate.   That prospect is less than attractive to many senators, andthere appeared this week to be growing support for the House plan.However, Senate rules make it possible for even a single senator toblock the majority will, especially with Congress trying to end itssession before Thanksgiving.   The House plan was worked out in close consultation with theWhite House, which has been desperately seeking to raise salariesfor federal judges and top agency officials.   President Reagan, as he left office in January, proposed a 51percent pay raise for Congress and the other officials but Congresswas forced to kill it after a storm of public protest.   Wednesday's letter of support from the president was crucial notonly for GOP support but for Democrats, who will use it toinoculate themselves from Republican attacks in next year'selections.   At the joint news conference on Wednesday, the drafters of thenew plan conceded it wasn't without faults. For example, thehonoraria ban allows members to make speeches and have the hostsdonate to charity on their behalf _ a useful political tool.</TEXT></DOC>
