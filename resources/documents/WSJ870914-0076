A 10-day meeting in London of the International Cocoa Organization ended in disarray in the early hours of Saturday morning, delegates said, with producers and consumers unable to agree on the price at which the ICCO's buffer-stock manager, Jurgen Plambeck, could re-enter the market and buy surplus cocoa.    Cocoa supplies exceed demand by 50,000 metric tons, said Giles Evans, a commodity analyst at brokers GNI Ltd. in London. Without the buffer-stock manager's support, &quot;cocoa prices must fall.&quot;    A metric ton is equal to 1.1 U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds.    Cocoa for December delivery was up $12 a ton to $1,879 Friday at the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York, but the price is down 12% from $2,136 July 15.    In March, ICCO producers and consumers agreed to have Mr. Plambeck buy cocoa when the price fell below 1,600 special drawing rights, or $2,070, a ton and to consider selling the commodity when quotes rose to 2,215 SDRs, or $2,860. An SDR represents a basket of currencies.    Mr. Plambeck succeeded in raising prices by buying surplus cocoa. However, by June 22 he reached his initial ICCO buying limit of 75,000 tons -- although he spent only $150 million out of $270 million in the organization's buffer-stock kitty, leaving sufficient cash to buy 60,000 or more additional tons.    However, at a meeting in July producing and consuming nations couldn't agree on more buffer stock purchases, and cocoa prices began to slide.    Prices rallied a bit recently because there was a belief the September meeting would be more successful, Mr. Evans said.    Now those in the market are going to be disappointed, he said.    Last week ICCO officials failed to agree on support operations because producer delegates resisted the consumer delegates request that the intervention price be lowered to 1,485 SDRs, or $1,920.    Mr. Plambeck was hoping that he could buy another 75,000 tons, delegates said. He was also hoping for more contributions from members, but funds from producers Brazil and the Ivory Coast weren't forthcoming.    At the latest meeting, though, delegates agreed to cut levies to finance support operations to $30 a ton from $45, delegates said, in part because producer nations haven't met their commitments. </TEXT></DOC>
