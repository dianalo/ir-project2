But political observers said over the weekend that Socialist leaders could block any attempt to form a government under the leading candidate of the Christian Democrats, Guilio Andreotti. Such a stalemate could lead to the dissolution of Parliament and early elections.    Mr. Craxi, a Socialist and Italy's longest-serving postwar prime minister, told leaders of the five parties that make up the ruling coalition that &quot;the moment has come to try to get out of the difficulty in which we have found ourselves for several months.&quot; He said he would step aside to allow the &quot;clarification&quot; of positions called for by the Christian Democrats.    Bickering between the Socialists, Christian Democrats, Republicans, Social Democrats and Liberals has been increasing for months. It reached its height two weeks ago, when Mr. Craxi said publicly that an agreement signed last summer for him to hand over power to a Christian Democrat this month &quot;didn't exist.&quot;    The Christian Democrats, the largest party in the ruling coalition with more than a third of the national vote, have long demanded that they be given the opportunity to hold the top government post. </TEXT></DOC>
