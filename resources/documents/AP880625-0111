WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NANTUCKET, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis, who so far has seemedblessed by that greatest of all political commodities, good luck,is enjoying a brief island retreat after a week in which eventsseemed to be moving against him.   In the span of a few days last week, the Massachusetts governorfaced the unpleasant task of raising state taxes and saw twopotential scandals burst into view back at the Boston Statehouse.   The Democratic presidential nominee-to-be came under freshattack from his Republican rival. And Jesse Jackson's shiftingcomments provided a potentially divisive distraction as Dukakissought to focus on the task of selecting a running mate.   ``It's not a worry,'' Dukakis said when asked about thepotential danger posed by Jackson to the ticket. ``I enjoy this.It's one of the great jobs of being a chief executive, ... puttinga team together.''   As Dukakis relaxed on this scenic island off Cape Cod,Republican rival George Bush already was seizing on his reluctantendorsement of state tax increases and stepping up his criticism ofthe governor's program allowing prison inmates out on furlough.   Dukakis' decision to sign the state legislature's bill imposinga 5 percent increase on the tax on cigarettes, producing $40million in revenues, was one of several moves to shore up a statebudget shortfall.   ``Taxes are always a last resort,'' Dukakis said in his defense.   With serious budget problems that already have promptingspending cuts, Dukakis also is supporting another $75 million inincreases by bringing the Massachusetts tax code in line withfederal tax changes.   Bush, the certain GOP nominee who lags behind Dukakis by doubledigits in most polls, immediately pointed to Dukakis' support forMassachusetts taxes as evidence he harbors a similar inclination asa fix for the large federal deficits.   ``I will not raise your taxes, period. He just has, in his homestate,'' Bush said.   He was voicing a ``tax cuts versus tax hikes'' theme Democratsexpect to hear more of as Republicans try to appeal to what theycalculate is a national aversion to deal with the deficit byincreasing taxes.   Dukakis has avoided saying he would support any federal taxincrease if elected president, but he clearly has left the dooropen.   He proposes increased efforts to enforce tax laws, including thehiring of more federal revenue agents, coupled with spending cutsand steps to increase revenues by spurring the economy.   ``If you do all those things and still need additional revenues,then you have to be willing to go to Congress and ask for it,''Dukakis said.   If Dukakis has seemed fortunate as major or potential rivalsdropped aside in his quest for the nomination, he might not havefelt that way Thursday, as he confronted a state deadline on thetax question, felt Bush's barbs, and faced questions aboutallegations of misdeeds in his administration.   Dukakis and his aides put forward a picture of unconcern overthe disclosure that the FBI was conducting a preliminaryinvestigation into the state's planned purchase of land for aprison in the rural town of New Braintree.   Dukakis denied any wrongdoing, and administration officialsquestioned whether political motivations lay behind disclosure.   The FBI, commenting on a report about the preliminary probe inThe Washington Times, said Dukakis was not the subject of theirinquiry _ but added that it was not yet at a stage where anyone wasa target.   Some residents of the town have accused Dukakis of cronyism inhis support for purchasing land there for the prison in a deal thatwould result in a handsome profit for developers who purchased theland. Whether Dukakis was acquainted with the developers was amatter of dispute. One, however, was a contributor to hispresidential campaign.   Dukakis cited ``executive privilege'' in refusing to release twodocuments sought by opponents. They are memos between Dukakis andhis legal counsel just before transactions involving the property.   An unrelated embarrassment came when the governor's formereducation adviser Gerard T. Indelicato was accused of larceny andforgery related to his state duties. Indelicato previously pleadedguilty to separate federal charges of fraud and conspiracy.   ``The criminal charges against Gerard Indelicato are veryserious, more so because they allege a violation of the publictrust,'' Dukakis said.   Over this series of backyard problems, the specter of Jackson'spotentially devisive interest in the vice presidency loomed.   Jackson has sent seemingly confusing, conflicting signals overwhether he wants the vice presidency, but it seemed certain he'dlike to be asked _ even though public polls suggest he would be adrag on the Democratic ticket nationally.   ``Everybody knows in the last analysis the nominee has to makethat decision, and people accept that ...'' Dukakis said.``Including Jesse, by the way.''</TEXT></DOC>
