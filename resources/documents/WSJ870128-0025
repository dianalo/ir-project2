Traders and analysts said index futures were boosted by higher Treasury bond futures prices and by a feeling that stocks, particularly blue-chip issues, are still attractive investments. They said short covering, or buying to offset earlier sales, also helped boost stock-index futures.    Contracts for March delivery on the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index closed 3.10 higher at 274.45. For much of the session, those contracts traded at a wide premium over the underlying Sandamp;P index.    &quot;It tells you there's a lot of bullish enthusiasm in the market,&quot; Courtney Smith, director of futures trading and research at Twenty-First Securities Corp. in New York, said.    Mr. Smith said that the theoretical value of the Sandamp;P March contract yesterday was 0.82 over the index but that the actual premium was 1.50 or higher for much of the session. That spurred arbitrage traders to sell the futures and buy the underlying stocks. Although that temporarily depressed futures prices, bullish traders bid them back up again.    Major Market Index futures for February delivery also sold at a premium over their theoretical value for part of the session. The Major Market Index is based on 20 blue-chip stocks, 15 of which are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    The programs, along with general bullishness, helped the Dow Jones industrials surge 43.17 points to close at a record 2150.45.    Gerald J. Walsh, stock-index futures analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, said both the stock and stock-index futures markets were supported by the promise of pending dividend payments in several blue-chip stocks.    Although yesterday's session saw some swings in prices of index futures, it was nothing like Friday, when wide moves and a sharply lower close left some traders with large losses.    Mr. Walsh said he views Friday's decline as profit-taking after a long rally. &quot;The tone is still good for the market,&quot; he said.    But not everyone was convinced. &quot;It's a very nervous market,&quot; one floor broker said at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where the Sandamp;P index futures are traded. &quot;Now people realize what can really happen here.&quot;    In other commodity markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Oil futures prices were mixed in thin, uneventful trading. Much of the activity was long liquidation, or selling contracts to offset those bought earlier, traders said. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures for March delivery tumbled 17 cents to $18.47 a barrel; heating oil and unleaded gasoline futures were mixed. &quot;It seems as if traders are marking time&quot; until Sunday, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' agreement to set a fixed price of $18 a barrel takes effect, one analyst said. If OPEC members adhere to the agreement and its production cuts, world oil prices probably will soon resume their recent rise, some analysts said.    COTTON: Futures prices, which have about doubled in the past six months, fell on aggressive profit-taking prompted by two statistical reports. The March contract fell the daily limit of two cents to 57.15 cents a pound. Other months showed smaller losses. From last Aug. 1 through last Friday, contract prices for nearby months had risen to 61.73 cents a pound from 30 cents. Analysts attributed the move to the initially low price and to indications that crops might be significantly reduced. But on Monday, the National Cotton Council, an industry group, forecast that U.S. cotton acreage would rise 6% to 10.6 million acres in the 1987-88 season beginning Aug. 1. And yesterday, the Census Bureau reported that daily U.S. cotton consumption fell 14% last month from November. &quot;The combination proved too much for the market and triggered active selling,&quot; Nauman Barakat, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York, said. Ernest Simon, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York, said the consumption figure might have been distorted by the cotton industry's many vacation days and holidays in December, but he conceded that the acreage increase was bearish for cotton prices.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices surged for the second consecutive session, aided this time by a decline in the dollar. &quot;The lower dollar set the trend,&quot; Robert Mizrahi, chief gold trader for Mocatta Metals Inc., New York, said. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery rose $4.40 an ounce to $415.70, and March silver contracts rose 2.5 cents to $5.715 an ounce. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum contracts for January delivery soared $7.60 to $538.50 an ounce. Institutional and program buying buoyed silver prices, Dennis Suskind, partner in charge of metals at J. Aron andamp; Co., New York, said. He also said metals traders are looking at the stock market as an indicator and buying on dips in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. &quot;There was a perk-up of interest&quot; in metals prices yesterday, for instance, when the stock market briefly retreated around mid-day, Mr. Suskind said. Nevertheless, the driving force in the gold market in coming weeks probably will continue to be the direction of the dollar, analysts and traders said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat futures tumbled, with the March contract leading the way. News that one million metric tons of wheat would be offered to China through the export enhancement program had a negative effect, analysts said, as traders expect Peking to buy hard red winter wheat rather than the soft red variety, which has been selling at a higher price. Corn prices were also lower. </TEXT></DOC>
