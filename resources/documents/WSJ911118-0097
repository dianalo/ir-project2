The prosecution's view is that the former chairman ofAmerican Continental Corp., by dint of his position, powerand personality, &quot;had to have known&quot; that company employeeswere duping investors. The defense, which rested withoutpresenting its own witnesses, argued that 10 weeks ofgoverment testimony didn't prove Mr. Keating was everinformed of alleged wrongdoing.</LP><TEXT>   Witnesses for the prosecution told of a top executive whoclosely monitored affairs at each of the company's formerproperties and subsidiaries -- down to choosing the color oftable napkins at the Phoenician Hotel in Phoenix, Ariz.   But under cross-examination, many of those witnessesagreed that Mr. Keating premised his financial decisions uponthe advice of lawyers and accountants -- especially when itcame to the timing and content of information released toprospective investors.   In his closing arguments Friday, Mr. Keating's lawyer,Stephen C. Neal, reviewed testimony of bank regulators whohad approved American Continental's bond sales program, andof experts who said that the company's difficulties had beenproperly disclosed in its prospectuses.   Mr. Neal said that one regulator, who testified that theprogram in its final days amounted to a &quot;Ponzi scheme,&quot; withcash from later sales being used to pay off old debt andinterest, later contradicted himself. He acknowledged thathis own report showed that American Continental's debt loaddecreased during the period of the bond sales.   Many elderly investors who bought American Continental'ssubordinated debentures claim they weren't givenprospectuses, or were distracted away from the fine print bysmooth-talking bond sellers. But to connect Mr. Keating withsuch sales tactics, Mr. Neal said, would require &quot;inferencepiled upon inference.&quot;   American Continental marketed its bonds at branches of itsLincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association unit from late 1986 untilFebruary 1989. Two months after that, the parent companyfiled for federal bankruptcy-law protection from creditors,and the thrift was seized by regulators.   While the bonds were being sold, &quot;nobody, nobody ever toldCharlie Keating that the rules weren't being followed,&quot; Mr.Neal said during his summation. &quot;Charlie Keating didn't knowand didn't influence what was being said in connection withthese transactions. There's not a shred of evidence that hedid.&quot;   Under California law, as in most states, a top executivecan be convicted of securities fraud only for unlawfulactions that he knew about, aided and intended to occur.However, Mr. Keating could soon face tougher federal bankingand securities statutes as he is the target of a wide-rangingcriminal investigation into various aspects of hisLincoln-related business.</TEXT></DOC>
