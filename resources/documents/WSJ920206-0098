Among the ideas being discussed among FederalCommunications Commission members and their staffs areaccelerating depreciation rates for phone companies andeasing ownership limits on radio and television stations.</LP><TEXT>   Although the FCC has had a deregulatory bent for years,the effort to clear up longstanding regulations thatcommunications companies find intrusive could crystallizewith President Bush's call for federal agencies to pinpointand speed actions that could stimulate economic growth.   Commissioner Sherrie Marshall is pushing at least 12 stepsthe agency could take -- perhaps within the year -- to easeor end rules, spur investment and create jobs. The proposals,many of which already are wending their way through thecommission, should be put on a fast track, she says.   Ms. Marshall's suggestions, contained in a memo toChairman Alfred Sikes, are circulating with great interest atthe FCC and within the video and phone industries. Ms.Marshall, the first commissioner to come up with such a list,has played a pivotal role in shaping commission decisions,successfully challenging Mr. Sikes and forcing the commissionto go in directions the chairman has opposed.   Among her suggestions: relax or lift completely the ban onindividuals or corporations owning more than 12 AM radiostations, 12 FM stations and 12 television stationsnationwide.   In addition, she believes FCC rules should be relaxed toallow more joint ownership and operation of local broadcaststations. Because of operating efficiencies and advertisingpackaging, easing restrictions could help keep some troubledstations on the air.   Among the more controversial proposals, Ms. Marshall alsowould like to see the commission allow TV networks to owncable systems. The move, she argues, could give the networksa new revenue stream at a time they are being hurt by thecable industry's rapid growth.   The FCC began examining the network-cable proposal lastyear, and it has generated much controversy. Indeed,Commissioner James Quello said he is tending toward notallowing networks to snap up cable companies -- and viceversa -- because it could hurt network affiliates andindependent stations. &quot;We'll have to examine whether it's aboon or a detriment to free over-the-air TV,&quot; he said.   For his part, Mr. Quello believes the commission should domore to end regulations that stifle American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co.'s ability to compete in sellingtelecommunications services to big business users.   Ms. Marshall would like to see revisions to depreciationschedules for the phone companies. &quot;This should spurinvestment in our telephone networks,&quot; a move that could leadto greater use of optical fiber and advanced switchingtechnologies. That won cheers from the telephone industry.John Sodolski, president of the U.S. Telephone Association,said that &quot;any acceleration of depreciation is a plus forthis industry.&quot;   Chairman Sikes, who had asked commissioners and keydepartments to zero in on rules that could be eased orlifted, initiated a review of FCC rules three years ago. Thecommission, for instance, is likely to vote by this spring oneasing radio ownership rules and has been cutting through thethicket of phone regulation.   Some commission staffers aren't so sure that any changescan be pushed through quickly, even at the behest ofPresident Bush. Many commission actions are preceded by hugeturf fights led by well-paid, influential lobbyists. &quot;Thereisn't a change we can make that doesn't have a large howlfactor to it,&quot; says a top FCC staffer.</TEXT></DOC>
