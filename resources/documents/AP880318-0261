The office of Secretary of State David Crombie said Thursday ithas moved to strip Jacob Luitjens, a retired botany teacher at theUniversity of British Columbia, of his Canadian citizenship.   Luitjens, in his late 60s, is fighting the attempt in thefederal court. He declined comment to reporters from his home inVancouver, but five years ago Luitjens denied allegations he helpedround up people resisting Nazi rule.   Crombie's spokesman, Jocelyn Francoeur, said full details cannotbe disclosed because the case is pending in court.   But Nazi-hunter Sol Littman, Canadian representative of theSimon Wiesenthal Center, hailed the government's action as abreakthrough in catching up with war-crime suspects who enteredCanada decades ago.   ``We've been after this guy for years and years,'' he said. ``Weknow the Dutch government wanted him very badly.''   Based on information from witnesses and other sources, Littmanalleged that Luitjens and his family belonged to the Dutch NationalSocialist Party before the war and that Luitjens and his fathervolunteered for the auxiliary police during the Nazi occupation.   Littman said Luitjens was directly involved in the deaths of a19-year-old member of the Dutch underground and a German deserter.   He said that after the war Luitjens fled to Paraguay and livedin a Mennonite colony, but was tried in his absence by a Dutch warcrimes court in 1948 and convicted of treason.   Treason is not an extraditable offense in Canada. The governmentrejected previous Dutch requests for Luitjens, who emigrated herein 1961 and retired from teaching four years ago.   The Toronto Star quoted Justice Minister Ray Hnatyshyn as sayingthat because of the law, deportation, rather than a trial inCanada, ``may be the only option available to us.''   The government set up a war crimes unit in the JusticeDepartment last year, based on the report of a special commissionheaded by Judge Jules Deschenes.   Unlike the U.S. Office of Special Investigations, Canada choseto concentrate on trying suspects here, rather than deporting orextraditing them as Deschenes also recommended.   The Deschenes report cited 20 cases requiring urgent action andan additional 218 in need of further investigation.   Under Canadian law, citizenship can be revoked if it wasobtained fraudulently or by withholding facts that would havedisqualified the applicant _ such as criminal convictions.   Even if Luitjens loses the citizenship battle, he can appealdeportation through the courts. The law normally requiresdeportation to the country from which a person arrived, in thiscase Paraguay rather than the Netherlands.</TEXT></DOC>
