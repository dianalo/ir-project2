<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-83-0550 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method for parallel computer calculation and OSIRIS program complexrealizing it and designed for numerical plasma simulation by the macroparticlemethod are described. The calculation can be carried out either withone or simultaneously with two computers BESM-6, that is provided bysome package of interacting programs functioning in every computer. Programinteraction in every computer is based on event techniques realized inOS DISPAK. Parallel computer calculation with two BESM-6 computers allowsto accelerate the computation 1.5 times. 6 refs.; 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
