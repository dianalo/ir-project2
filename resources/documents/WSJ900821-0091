Seib and Robert S. Greenberger   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>08/21/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A3</SO><CO>   MDEST</CO><GV>EXECUTIVE (EXE)STATE DEPARTMENT (STD)</GV><LP>   President Bush said for the first time that Americans andother Westerners detained in Iraq and Kuwait are hostages,thereby elevating their importance -- and the stakes -- inhis confrontation with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.   In a speech in Baltimore to the Veterans of Foreign Wars,Mr. Bush said he had been &quot;reluctant to use the term hostage&quot;in the past two weeks. &quot;But,&quot; he said, &quot;when Saddam Husseinspecifically offers to trade the freedom of those citizens ofmany nations he holds against their will in return forconcessions, there can be little doubt that whatever theseinnocent people are called, they are, in fact, hostages.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Faced with few options to protect Americans in Kuwait andIraq, the President warned: &quot;I will hold the government ofIraq responsible for the safety and well-being of Americancitizens held against their will.&quot;   Mr. Bush's rhetoric moved the U.S. a step closer tohostilities with Iraq. By framing the issue so starkly, heexpanded the circumstances under which the U.S. would movemilitarily against Baghdad -- and may have put himself in aposition in which he would be forced to react if harm comesto Americans being detained.   Hours after Mr. Bush spoke, the State Department said inWashington that at least 12 Americans who had been staying inhotels in Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2, &quot;have beenrelocated by the Iraqis&quot; to an unknown destination. StateDepartment spokesman Richard Boucher said some of the U.S.citizens &quot;were taken with other, much larger groups offoreigners.&quot;   They may be going to Baghdad,&quot; a U.S. official added,&quot;That's something we presume.&quot;   At least 35 other Americans in Kuwait were moved earlierby the Iraqis, and their whereabouts remain unknown.   A European diplomatic source in Washington said thatgroups consisting of about 20 Westerners from differentnations apparently were being rounded up in Kuwait by theIraqis and were being moved at frequent intervals. The sourcesaid much of the information his government was receiving wasvague and difficult to verify. But he said, &quot;Our feeling isthe process has begun. People are being picked up and movedaround.&quot;   Until now, the Bush administration had calculated that thebest chance for getting Americans and other Westerners out ofIraq and Kuwait was to keep the spotlight off them and hopethat many could filter out or that an internationalevacuation could be arranged quietly.   Mr. Bush had been hoping to avoid an Iran-style hostagecrisis, in which U.S. policy would become handcuffed bypublic fixation on the status of civilians caught up in thestandoff between Baghdad and Washington. But the change intactics by Mr. Bush, which came after a Sunday night WhiteHouse strategy session between the president and his topaides, was prompted by Iraq's declaration that foreignerswere going to be used as a &quot;shield&quot; protecting Iraq from U.S.and other Western military forces.   According to Associated Press and Reuters reports, Iraqsaid it had begun moving Western detainees to importantmilitary sites that might become targets for U.S. bombs. Thereports quoted an Iraqi spokesman as saying, &quot;Iraq's foreignguests have been in fact moved to all vital and militaryinstallations.&quot; U.S. officials were unable to confirm whetherthe statement was accurate.   Saddam Hussein also warned diplomats in Kuwait that ifthey fail to close their embassies in Kuwait they would losetheir diplomatic immunity and be treated as any otherforeigners. There are about 130 diplomats in the U.S. Embassyin Kuwait.   Having chosen to focus on the hostages, Mr. Bush now facesthe same challenges that bedeviled former Presidents Carterand Reagan in such circumstances. To satisfy Americans, hewill have to display concern for the hostages. Yet at thesame time, he will try to convince Saddam Hussein that hewon't back down from his demands or from his willingness touse military might to enforce a United Nations trade embargoon Iraq.   While the hostage issue seems to complicate Mr. Bush'splanning, there isn't any sign that he is backing away fromhis goals or that he is trying to leave Saddam Hussein aface-saving way out of the crisis. In his VFW speech, thepresident declared that U.S. objectives remain the &quot;complete,immediate and unconditional withdrawal&quot; of Iraq from Kuwait;the restoration of the ousted Kuwaiti government, and the&quot;security and the stability of Saudi Arabia and the PersianGulf.&quot;   After his speech, Mr. Bush insisted that he wasn't&quot;turning up the heat&quot; over the issue of detained Americans.In remarks to reporters, he explained that he used the termbecause Iraq linked freedom for the foreigners to a pulloutof U.S. and other troops from the region. Such demands &quot;aretotally unsatisfactory to most countries in the world,&quot; Mr.Bush said. &quot;That can't stand.&quot;   Mr. Bush said that the showdown with Iraq could be longand that tough decisions remain to be made. The president islikely to make one such decision today, activating somemilitary reservists. Estimates of the size of such a call-uphave ranged as high was 200,000, but the White Houseindicated the figure would be smaller.   In an apparent attempt to keep U.S. public opinion behindhis policy, Mr. Bush portrayed the growing U.S. presence inthe Gulf as a moral mission against aggression and an attemptto defend U.S. friends, rather than a selfish effort toprotect the U.S. supply of cheap oil. In his 25-minute VFWspeech, his longest statement so far on the Gulf crisis, Mr.Bush didn't mention the word &quot;oil&quot; once.   Separately, the administration expressed concern that themounting tensions in the Persian Gulf could spill over intoother parts of the Middle East. The State Department said itwas permitting nonessential embassy personnel and dependentsin Jordan to leave that country if they wished, and itadvised other Americans to consider doing the same.   An administration official explained that in view ofanti-U.S. demonstrations and Saddam Hussein's stronginfluence in Jordan, &quot;we're concerned about how the securitysituation might evolve and decided it was appropriate to letpeople leave.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
