Wearing earplugs and bifocals and clutching a bulging, oversized handbag, Jane Scott appears to have wandered into the wrong auditorium. But Miss Scott, who considers herself the &quot;world's oldest teenager,&quot; plays a critical role in determining whether regional groups like the Dead Boys make it in the multibillion-dollar rock industry.    At the age of 67, Miss Scott is the nation's senior rock 'n' roll critic in a city as much associated with rock music as New Orleans is with jazz. Indeed, Cleveland is to be the future home of the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.    As a launching pad, &quot;Cleveland was the break-out city,&quot; says Don George, the regional promotional manager for MCA Records. And Miss Scott was often a seminal influence. &quot;She was at the first gigs of lots of stars when they were zeros,&quot; declares Steve Popovich, the executive vice president of Nashville operations for Polygram Records Inc. &quot;She's a real national treasure who belongs in the Hall of Fame.&quot;    Since the Beatles came to town in 1964, her reviews in the Cleveland Plain Dealer have helped launch such stars as Bruce Springsteen; David Bowie; Blood, Sweat and Tears; and the Fabulous Thunderbirds. Paul McCartney, on tour with his group, Wings, told her recently that he remembered her from his early Beatle days because, Miss Scott says, &quot;I was the only middle-aged woman who interviewed him.&quot; She adds: &quot;I wasn't flattered.&quot;    A local group called Beaucoup, on the verge of cracking the big time, plans to record a song called &quot;Jane,&quot; just to thank her for her help.    In part, Miss Scott has succeeded by outlasting almost everyone else in a business in which burnout often strikes early. For two decades, she covered not just rockers but also the elderly -- leading a local magazine to say she ran the gamut from &quot;geriatrics and pacemakers to Gerry and the Pacemakers.&quot; But several years ago she began devoting full time to rock coverage. &quot;I like the excitement and the turmoil,&quot; Miss Scott says.    Her longevity in her job reflects a knack for reviewing groups through the eyes of a teen-ager. In her critique of the Dead Boys, for instance, she complains that the lead singer &quot;didn't try to hang himself . . . He didn't flop around like a dying trout. He didn't even spit or knock his forehead on the floor.&quot; (He had pulled such stunts in earlier shows.) And rather than take the four-member group to task for obvious mistakes, she notes that &quot;the band has all the potential to get down to work, tighten up and soar.&quot;    Unlike many of her peers, most of whom are males in their 30s, she never takes herself too seriously. Once she led a platoon of golden agers, box radios tucked under their arms, who picketed a local radio station to pressure it into playing an album called &quot;The Golden Age of Rock.&quot; When singer Lou Reed was with the Velvet Underground, Miss Scott posed in his lap for a magazine cover.    Yet Miss Scott is tenacious. She has a legendary knack for getting interviews, even from tight-lipped performers -- by offering to read their palms, by analyzing their handwriting, or by getting them to autograph their albums.    If such ploys fail, Miss Scott sometimes will try acting the understanding matron. Joe Eszterhas, a contributing editor of Rolling Stone magazine and writer of the movies &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; and &quot;Flashdance,&quot; recalls unsuccessfully competing against her for an interview with the late Jim Morrison of the Doors. &quot;I had all the right accouterments,&quot; he says. &quot;I was bearded, my hair was long. But I didn't get anywhere.&quot; Miss Scott, however, got Mr. Morrison to spend an hour on the phone discussing religion, the future and life in general. &quot;Maybe because I was older, he found it easy to talk to me,&quot; says Miss Scott with a shrug.    Miss Scott leads a double life, as possessions in her cluttered apartment demonstrate. One large closet is jammed with shelves of rock 'n' roll albums. A bedroom overflows with antique gum-ball machines and maps, newspapers and directories dating back to the early 1800s. In her living room, a stereo surrounded by dozens of books about rock music faces an Edison wind-up phonograph that plays cylinders of turn-of-the-century tangos. She uses two telephones -- one modern and the other made in 1910.    &quot;I collect antiques because I get absorbed in another world, and it's very relaxing,&quot; says Miss Scott. So even at home, she tends to span the ages.    Indeed, Miss Scott claims that one difference between her and most of her friends is that they are locked musically into certain time periods. &quot;Some of my girlfriends who are 20 years younger will light up when you say Four Tops,&quot; she says, &quot;but they don't know anything about Joan Jett.&quot; She is referring to the emerging rock star who plays actor Michael J. Fox's older sister in a current movie, &quot;Light of Day,&quot; which was filmed in Cleveland.    &quot;I'm always with younger people, so I don't know that I'm not 15 to 19 years old,&quot; Miss Scott says. She would like to write about rock forever, she says, because &quot;it's always new and crazy -- and always changing.&quot;    The Plain Dealer uses only a limited amount of free-lance and syndicated articles to back up Miss Scott because she is so prolific. She writes at least three columns and features for the Plain Dealer's Friday tabloid and another two to three reviews for the rest of the week. Rumors circulated recently that she might be forced to give up the rock beat. Plain Dealer editors, excited that the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame is coming to Cleveland, confided to some reporters that they were thinking of replacing her with a younger, flashier writer. That prompted 126 Plain Dealer colleagues to petition editors to reconsider. Also, a local FM station, WMMS, which is consistently picked the best rock station in the country by Rolling Stone magazine, rallied behind her.    Thom Greer, the Plain Dealer's managing editor, says any change involving Miss Scott's beat &quot;is an internal matter. I can't discuss it further.&quot; But, for the moment at least, it appears that Miss Scott will keep the rock beat.    Miss Scott, a one-time Sunday-school teacher and Republican Party booster, didn't always spend her evenings and weekends with pimply-faced adolescents. She started with the Plain Dealer in 1952, typing up bridal announcements for the society page. &quot;That was the only way a girl could get a job on a newspaper,&quot; she says. In 1958, she landed on the paper's &quot;Boy andamp; Girl&quot; pages, which led to writing about pop-music groups at area high schools.    Miss Scott didn't get hooked on rock until 1964. That's when Cleveland's mayor briefly banned rock concerts after a Beatles performance turned into a riot. After that, she covered virtually every performer who stopped here as well as emerging local groups.    Miss Scott continues to address her readers' varied and changing tastes. Larry Collins, a talent buyer and promoter at a local club called Peabody's Down Under, says that while other critics cover only mainstream rock 'n' roll, Miss Scott &quot;tries to turn people on to college groups, cult stuff, alternative stuff.&quot;    Take the Mentors, for example. &quot;They're a porno rock group,&quot; explains Miss Scott. She interviewed them for a story even though, she says, &quot;the names of their songs aren't printable in a family newspaper. They're disgusting. But my theory is that you still have to know what's going on out there.&quot;    Miss Scott blends into most concert audiences, dressing casually in slacks and flat shoes, but she refuses to smoke marijuana. Occasionally, she flashes a handwritten sign that says, &quot;Yes, I'm a reporter&quot; to ease fears that she is a narcotics agent.    Over the years, Miss Scott has made only minor adjustments to deal with her demanding beat. She never leaves for a concert, for instance, without taking her earplugs. &quot;I don't put them on till it really gets loud. Then, you hear the concert, but anything beyond the pain level is eliminated.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
