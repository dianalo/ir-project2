A senior U.S. official told reporters Mulroney gave Reagan``some private ideas'' on how they might reach agreement on theissue. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, couldoffer no details on those ideas.   At a welcoming ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House,Reagan told the Canadian leader, ``More can be done to protect ourenvironment when science clearly points the way. Make no mistake,we are moving.''   The U.S. government contends that more needs to be done indeveloping clean coal technology before targets and timetables canbe set for reducing coal-fired power plant emissions that Canadianssay are damaging their forests and lakes.   Canada has been pressing for an agreement on a timetable toreduce emissions to specified levels. In an interview beforeleaving Ottawa, Mulroney likened the U.S. acid-rain emissions tothis country ``dumping garbage'' on its northern neighbor.   Asked about this as the two leaders posed for photographersbefore their meeting in the Oval Office, Mulroney said, ``I thinkit's very clear that acid rain has that effect on the environmentin the eastern United States and Canada, yes. I think that's anormal fact.''   Mulroney pleaded before a joint meeting of Congress for what heacknowledged would be expensive programs to clean up U.S.emissions, which he said caused half the acid rain that has killed15,000 Canadian lakes and threatened or damaged 300,000 more.   ``Half of our acid rain comes across the border, directly fromthe United States, falling upon our forests, killing our lakes,soiling our cities,'' Mulroney told Congress.   ``It is despoiling your environment as inexorably as our,'' hesaid. ``It is damaging your environment as inexorably as it isours. It is damaging your environment from Michigan to Maine, andthreatens marine life on the Eastern Seabord.''   He said Canadian acid rain wafting to the United States will behalved by his government's programs. ``We ask nothing more thanthis from you.''   ``We invite the administration, and the leadership of Congress,to conclude an accord whereby we agree on a schedule and targetsfor reducing acid rain that crosses our border,'' he said. ``Thecost of reducing acid rain is substantial, but the cost of inactionis greater still.   ``What would be said of a generation of North Americans thatfound a way to explore the stars, but allowed its lakes and foreststo languish and die?''   Reagan agreed later in a toast at a state dinner in Mulroney'shonor ``there is much still to be done'' on acid rain but said``progress is being made.''   The Canadian prime minister called the occasion ``the last ofour home and home visits'' and said he believed they had become``part of the institutional relationship between Canada and theUnited States.''   The president, asked what steps the United States was taking tomeet Mulroney's concerns, said, ``Well, we've been trying to workon it.''   Mulroney described the issue as a ``very complicatedtrans-boundary problem'' and said, ``I hope we get a solution. Idon't expect anything within moments, but we have been makingmovement, and we hope to make a lot more.''   In his response to Reagan at the welcoming ceremony, Mulroneysaid, ``This, as you said in Quebec City, Mr. President, is aproblem that belongs to both of us. We must continue and we shallto work together for an equitable solution to this importantchallenge.''   The two leaders first met in 1985 in Quebec City, then followedup with meetings in Washington in 1986 and in Ottawa last April. Atthat meeting, Reagan said he would ``consider the prime minister'sproposal for a bilateral accord on acid rain.'' Canada, however, isdissatisfied with the U.S. follow-up to this commitment.   ``The prime minister said he continues to believe that an accordshould be possible and gave the president some private ideas onwhat might be in the accord,'' the senior administration officialsaid. The official said Reagan's reaction, in effect, was, `We willlook at them.''   At Wednesday's meeting, Reagan gave his permission for Canada tobuy tightly held U.S. nuclear submarine technology. Ottawa isconsidering the purchase of 10 or 12 nuclear-powered attacksubmarines, either from Britain or France.   Because the British ``Trafalgar'' class subs use American powerplants, U.S. permission will be required if the Canadians pick theBritish design.   The official said Reagan informed Mulroney that he would approvethe technology transfer _ making Canada the first nation outsideBritain to be eligible to acquire the technology. Action byCongress is also required.   Reagan and Mulroney also discussed the pending free tradeagreement between the United States and Canada and said they do notbelieve it will be endangered by Reagan's threatened veto of atrade bill being considered in the Senate, the official reported.   Reagan addressed Mulroney as ``Brian'' throughout the welcomingceremony. The prime minister addressed Reagan as ``Mr. President''and saluted him as ``a leader of warmth and directness.''   Turning to the trade agreement, now pending before the CanadianParliament and to be submitted to Congress in June, Reaganpredicted that both legislative bodies would approve it.   ``Protectionism is out,'' he said. ``Trade expansionism is in.''   Mulroney said ``both countries stand to gain'' from the measure,which would reduce tariffs.</TEXT></DOC>
