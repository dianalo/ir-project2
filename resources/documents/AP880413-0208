(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Commercial space launching willdevelop into an important industry in the 1990s, and competitionmay include the Soviet Union, a U.S. Department of Transportationofficial said Wednesday.   ``I think we will see innovation (in the commercial spaceindustry),'' Courtney Stadd, director of DOT's commercialtransportation office, told about 400 space industry workers at theFourth National Space Symposium here. ``There is some advantage totaking private spaceports seriously.''   DOT, as a result of the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984, hasa mandate to define and regulate commercial space efforts.   Stadd said DOT's role is to encourage a ``competitive anddiverse'' launch industry, and to ``regulate efficiently to ensuresafe and reponsible launch activities.''   The scope of the space industry is expanding with the start ofcompetition in the commercial launch field, and the Soviet Unionmay become one of the bidders, Stadd said. He added that he doesnot see the Soviets as an active competitor in the near future.   Commercial space launch was born in the era in which the U.S.government concentrated its spending on the space shuttle program.   When the Challenger explosion and U.S. rocket failures created alarge backlog of commercial payloads, Japan, China and France begancompeting for U.S. launching business.   The concept of commercial launch competition has brought up newissues, Stadd said. The major problem being worked out is how toallocate launching facilities among government agencies and privatecorporations.</TEXT></DOC>
