Any laptop user who's ever printed from the road knows what abother it can be.andP;  You arrange to stop by your brother-in-law's office, onlyto find that you don't have the light printer driver for your software.andP;  Youpray that the hotel's busines center is open late, but it's not.andP;  As a lastresort you try the old modem-it-to-a-fax-machine trick to get a few pages ofhard-albeit curly-copy.andM;Either you endure the hassle or you carry a printer with you-an option thatnewer, lighter, smaller printers are making more attractive.andM;A half-dozen pint-size printers-most priced at less than  500-are con tendingfor spots in the attaches of today's well-equipped travelers, and more are onthe way (see &quot;Late Entry from Citizen America a Contender,&quot; page 135).andO;Seikosha, Toshiba, and Axonix build dot matrix printers requiring less cubicspace than many shaving kits.andP;  Canon and Kodak pack ink jet technology intosmall packages.andP;  And Mannesmann Tally crams a thermal page printer in a boxno larger than a notebook PC.andM;But it takes more than downsizing to make the extra baggage of a portableprinter worth packing.andP;  What's the point of carrying a printer if it'sinconvenient to use, or if the print quality is no better than what you'd geton a bleary fax, o if you have to wait longer for a printout than you do forlanding clearance a O'Hare? To find the absolute best of the portable printerbreed, we ranked and rated each of the six printers on a variety of criteria,including print speed, noise level, paper handling, output quality, andconvenience.andP;  After evaluating each printer, we put them to a final test: Didthey fit into a roomy briefcase along with a notebook computer, poweradapter, paper, and supplies? (Bonus points were awarded if enough room wasleft for a Daytimer and plane tickets.)andM;So which of the six came out on top?andM;Flying First ClassandM;The Mannesmann Tally MT735 may cost more than twice as much as its closestcompetitor, but it's worth every penny.andP;  First, consider the package:Weighing slightly more than 8 pounds, the MT735 ingeniously hides itspaper-handling mechanism behind a snap-open lid.andP;  Push a button, grab thelid, pull out and up, and you have a 50-page sheet feeder.andP;  The unit has noextruding ports, knobs, or buttons.andP;  You can't inadvertently switch the poweron (and thereby drain its batteries).andP;  So when the MT735 is packed fortravel, it tucks neatly into a briefcase or other piece of luggage.andP;  Next,look at the print quality: Unmatched by any other portable printer, theMT735's close-to-laser output outdoes many a desktop printer.andP;  It does veryrespectable LaserJet Series II emulation, handles graphics admirably, andprints black, sharp text and graphics like no dot-based printer can.andP;  Nowfactor in performance.andP;  The MT735 is very quiet and very fast.andP;  The onlysound you hear is the whir of the platen as the paper passes through.andP;  Theonly wait you have is about 15 seconds from the moment you press the Printbutton until the dark, crisp output is in your hand.andP;  Mannesmann Tally ratesthe MT735's print speed at six pages per minute, and our tests showed thespeed to be just shy of that figure.andM;Need more convincing? How about three resident fonts, a megabyte of memory tohandle downloaded fonts and graphics, a battery life of about 150 pages, andfour printer emulations? The best &quot;extra&quot; of all, though, is the printer'scopy button, which when pressed spews forth a duplicate of the last pageprinted-great when you need to print multiple copies but don't want to tie upyour laptop.andP;  So what don't we like about the MT735? Our only real gripe isits high operating cost.andP;  Ribbons cost $15 each (they're sold in packs offive r $75) in a market where ink cartridges and printer ribbons typicallycost a third of that.andP;  But what's a $15 ribbon when you're flying firstclass?andM;Business ClassandM;Not everyone has pockets deep enough to go first class.andP;  That's why we chosea second portable printer to share top honors.andP;  Next to the MT735, the CanonBJ- 10e bubble jet printer provides the darkest, most professional-lookingoutput of the portable printers we tested (see the sidebar for CitizenAmerica's late entry).andP;  An ink jet printer, the BJ-10e prints dark, ifslightly fuzzy, text at the rate of about a page every 90 seconds in either&quot;high-quality&quot; or economy&quot; mode.andP;  The difference between the two modes is theamount of ink spewed onto the page.andP;  Ink jet printing is essentially adot-based technology, so the BJ-10e's text suffers from the same jagged edgesas dot matrix printed pages do.andP;  Still, the BJ-10e's darker ink and tighterdot pattern generate better-looking text, charts, and graphics than theportable dot matrix machines.andM;The Canon portable has a very smart design.andP;  It's shaped much like a notebookPC, with a flip top that acts as an output tray on one side and mountingslots for an optional sheet feeder on the other.andP;  The printer stands on itsedge, feeding paper from one side to the other in a straight, jam-free paperpath.andP;  No BJ-10e user should consider the sheet feeder an option.andP;  It adds$90 and 2 inches to the printer's depth, but it's worth every cent andcentimeter for the added convenience and efficiency.andM;In addition to quality printing and compact design, the BJ-10e offers quietoperation, no-mess ink cartridges, easy setup, and a battery life of about 30pages.andP;  And while it may not offer the performance and functionality of theMannesmann Tally portable, it's half as expensive to own and half asexpensive to operate.andM;Going CoachandM;The remaining four printers aren't without merit, but none combinespackaging, performance, and print quality the way Mannesmann Tally and Canondo.andM;The Kodak Diconix 150 Plus is an exquisite example of good things in smallpackages.andP;  If this truly tiny printer didn't show its dot patterns quite somuch, it would give the BJ-10e 10a run for its money.andP;  Smaller than a pair ofsize 10 wing tips, the Diconix quietly prints a page a minute.andP;  It emulatesboth the IBM Proprinter and the Epson FX-series printers, so compatibility isno problem.andP;  The Diconix makes best use of form-feed paper-single sheets tendto shift as they pass over the platen, so setup is slower than with the pageprinters.andM;The Diconix 150 Plus works just fine as a purchase order, invoice, and memoprinter, and it does OK with graphics, but the BJ-10e, at the same price, isa better value.andP;  The only reason to opt for the Diconix is if you're aScrooge about briefcase real estate.andP;  Although the.andP;  Seikosha LT-20 is largerthan the Diconix-you can fit two Diconix printers with room to spare in thespace required for the LT-20-its neat under-laptop design and integrated50-sheet paper cassette make this printer the most convenient of the portabledot matrix printers.andP;  The 24-pin printer is meant to sit under your laptop,churning out reasonably clean dot matrix copy.andM;But its convenience and print quality are overshadowed considerably by theLT-20's negatives: slow print speed (about 2 minutes to print a page oftext), noisy operation, and smudge-prone inked ribbon.andM;One feature that may redeem the LT-20 is its slick paper handling, includingits ability to easily handle multipart forms.andP;  The sheet feeder, which slidesinto the underside of the printer, means you don't have to hassle withform-feed paper or with rolling paper into position.andP;  A slot in front letsyou feed individual sheets and multipart forms into the printer so they arealigned with the print head.andP;  If you work with multipart forms in youron-the-road printing, this machine is ideal.andM;We would love to place the Toshiba ExpressWriter 301 higher on our list.andP;  Itprints clean, dark text quietly and, for a 24-pin printer, reasonablyquickly.andP;  It handles cut sheet paper like a charm, and it's a snap to set up.andM;There was just one problem: The ExpressWriter 301 didn't fit in ourbriefcase.andP;  Although its dimensions seem trim enough, its 31/4-inch heightmakes it too thick to fit on top of a notebook PC, but its 12 1/2-inch lengthmakes the printer too long to fit next to a notebook.andP;  The culprit is theExpressWriter's platen knob, which sticks out about a half inch too far toallow both it and a notebook PC to fit together in the same case.andP;  Toshibaneeds to go back to the drawing board and figure out a way to trim about aninch or so off the length of this printer.andP;  Then we'd be ready to put theExpressWriter 301 much higher on our list.andM;andlsqb;Note: At press time, Toshiba informed us that it was discontinuingproduction of the ExpressWriter 301.andP;  The printer will still be availablethrough retail outlets, however.andrsqb; Last, and in our estimation least, is theAxonix LiteWrite.andP;  It's simply too big, too noisy, and too messy.andP;  It fit inour briefcase, but we practically had to sit on the lid to get the easeclosed.andP;  The print quality is no better than average, and you have to waitmore than a minute to get a page out of it.andP;  Top that with too many looseparts to track and a separate, bulky form feeder, and you have a printer thathas little to recommend it.andM;Late Entry from Citizen America a ContenderandM;No sooner had we tested the six portable printers in this feature than therumor mill began churning out gossip of new small-scale printers.andP;  Among thenames whispered through the grapevine: Epson, Brother International, IBM,Star Micronics, and Citizen America.andM;Calls to these manufacturers produced some foot shuffling and only one firmconfirmation, from Citizen America.andP;  We hear that the other four companiesare working on printers that use the same bubble jet technology as the CanonBJ-10e.andM;Fortunately, we got our hands on the PN48 Notebook Printer from CitizenAmerica just as this issue was going to press.andP;  Although it isn't included inour ranking, its excellent print quality, small footprint, and reasonableprice would certainly have placed it very high on our list.andM;The PN48 is truly portable, with dimensions so diminutive that it fits rightin with the sundries in your overnight bag.andP;  And ifs incredibly light,weighing 2.5 pounds with its NiCad battery (2 pounds without it).andM;The PN48 uses what Citizen calls &quot;thermal fusion' technology, which transfersand bonds tonerlike material a character at a time to the page.andP;  Thelaserlike output rivals that of the Mannesmann Tally MT735 printer.andP;  The PN48has two paper paths, a rear ba for cut sheets, and a bottom feed that letsyou print to cut sheets, labels, envelopes, and transparencies.andP;  Eithermethod offers easy paper handling, but there's no paper tray-you must feedthe sheets a page at a time.andP;  At a page per minute for text-only documents,printing a long report or heavy-duty graphics is an ordeal.andM;But the PN48 really shines when you use it for what it does best-printing aletter, document, or simple graphic here and there from the road.andP;  Itproduces only a low-volume hum as it creates output.andP;  It offers twoserviceable business typefaces, Roman and Courier, in seven pitches.andP;  There'sno HP LaserJet emulation, but it works with drivers for Citizen, Epson LQ,and IBM Proprinter dot-matrix printers.andM;Batteries last up to 2 hours, or 25 pages of text, per charge  (about halfthat for dense text or graphics); an LED indicator and an alarm alert youwhen the battery is low.andP;  Don't let it run too low, though, since a completerecharge takes 6 hours; plugging in the adapter at the warning signal cutsrecharge time to 2 hours.andM;The PN48 is an excellent value: Listing at $549, it offers print qualitycomparable to that of Mannesmann Tally's MT735 for less than half the price.andO;Consumables are cheap, too: It comes outfitted with both a single-strikeribbon cassette  (for laser quality output; its life is 20 to 25 pages oftext) and a multistrike cassette (50 to 70 pages); a five-pack of replacementcassettes costs $24.95.andP;  Also included are an adapter, a carrying case, auser's manual in both paper and disk form, and its own parallel cable.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
