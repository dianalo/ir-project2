<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-14-1323 </DOCNO><TEXT>Ever since it was proposed more than three decades ago, the nuclear opticalmodel has been very successful in interpreting a large body of nucleon-inducednuclear reaction data in terms of a complex nucleon-nucleus potential.Rapid progress both in the experimental measurements and the theoreticaldevelopments in the last two decades has lead to a better understandingof this nucleon-nucleus optical potential. From the parameter-fittingphenomenological stage, the optical model has come a long way startingfrom the fundamental nucleon-nucleon interaction. Excellent reviews onvarious aspects of the optical model exist in the literature for protonenergies above 10 MeV. The present article is an attempt to review comprehensivelythe status of the proton-nucleus optical potential at low proton energies,below the Coulomb-barrier, for target nuclei with mass numbers lyingbetween 40 and 130. The set of phenomenological optical potential derivedmostly from (p,n) reaction data are reviewed and their applicabilitiesdiscussed. The neutron-nucleus optical model is referred to whereverit is relevant. Microscopic calculations for one case is carried outand compared with the corresponding phenomenological values. 78 refs.,7 figures, 4 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
