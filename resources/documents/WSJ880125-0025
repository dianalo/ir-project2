But such a drop has been limited so far, and some analysts think Japan's short-term rates are likely to rise this week instead.    Japanese interest rates often fall in January, and this year has been no exception. Certain short-term rates have dropped to about 3 1/2% from just above 4% the last week of December.    Additional anticipation of an easing in rates was aroused by central bank Gov. Satoshi Sumita. He has said repeatedly since the middle of this month that short-term rates would be allowed to fall in response to seasonal factors.    This view was supported during Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's recent visit to Washington, where he agreed with President Reagan to increase bilateral cooperation in currency market intervention.    Last week, Japanese central bank officials persisted in encouraging speculation that rates are headed lower by suggesting that the Bank of Japan would sanction a drop in the long-term prime rate at the end of the month.    But with Japan's domestic economy growing at a healthy clip, the only reason to lower interest rates further would be to help out the dollar. The dollar was quoted at 127.25 yen in late Friday trading, slightly above its year-end 1987 level, but down more than 50% from its early 1985 highs.    So far, the Bank of Japan's actions belie its words, skeptics say. The Bank of Japan &quot;is backed into a corner,&quot; says a Japanese commercial bank official. &quot;It doesn't want to lower interbank rates, and it wants to keep open-market rates from rising.&quot;    Japanese bill discount rates have remained unchanged since Jan. 7, when the one-month and two-month rates each dropped 1/16 percentage point, to 3.75% and 3.815%, respectively. That's far below comparable U.S. rates. But given the yen's strength, global investors are content to earn lower returns on Japanese investments. If Japanese interest rates dropped further, though, some investors might switch into dollars, aiding the U.S. currency.    Within Japan, corporate salary payments are expected to increase demands for funds in the interbank market this week, perhaps pushing up rates. And competition among Japanese banks also may cause open-market rates on certificates of deposit to rise. Market observers are counting on the Bank of Japan to counteract those pressures.    But the Japanese central bank &quot;doesn't have that many tools at its disposal,&quot; and must consider its timing very carefully, says Teruo Shinato, manager of the treasury division at Fuji Bank Ltd. And if the Bank of Japan does nothing to contain a rise in Japanese CD rates, that could contribute to a deterioration of the dollar.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar firmed against most major currencies, supported by fear of central bank intervention. Continuing bearish sentiment based on the large U.S. trade deficit is seen limiting the dollar's upward potential, however, confining it to a narrow trading range.    Remarks by a West German central bank official caused the dollar to give back some of its gains Friday. The Bundesbank official, Vice President Helmut Schlesinger, told a West German news agency that the Group of Seven industrialized nations didn't set target zones for the dollar in their Dec. 23 &quot;telephone accord.&quot; Part of the dollar's strength this year has come from speculation that the major central banks are defending an agreed-upon range for the U.S. currency.    In late New York dealings Friday, the dollar stood at 1.6685 West German marks, up from 1.6650 Thursday. The British pound slipped to $1.7885 from $1.7945. The dollar was unchanged at 127.25 Japanese yen.    The dollar traded as high as 1.6780 marks and 127.95 yen in New York Friday before Mr. Schlesinger's remarks were reported.    In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at 127.75 yen.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for current delivery fell $1 an ounce to $477.50 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.9 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $477.95 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Friday, Jan. 22, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
