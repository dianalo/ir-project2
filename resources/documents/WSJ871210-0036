In an unusual move, the fund's investment adviser, Skandifond Fiduciary AB, said it will quit in March amid a controversy over the fund's investment choices. And in a related development, half the fund's 10 directors yesterday urged shareholders to liquidate the 18-month-old fund.    Currently, the fund is seeking long-term capital appreciation through a diversified portfolio of Scandinavian securities. It hasn't had much luck. It closed yesterday on the American Stock Exchange at $7.50 a share, up 87.5 cents, but still down from its original issue price of $10 in early 1986.    The Scandinavia Fund invests like a mutual fund, but has a closed-end structure, with a fixed number of shares that trade on the Amex at a discount or premium to the net asset value of the fund's portfolio.    Alexander Vik, the fund's controlling holder, recently proposed changing course by reorganizing the fund to buy holdings primarily in which his company has a controlling interest -- and not necessarily in Scandinavian securities.    That has infuriated Bjorn Carlson, fund president and managing director of the fund's advisory firm, a unit of Aktiv Placering AB, Sweden's largest money manager. Changing the fund's course &quot;could be dangerous for other shareholders,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;It's different than what they bought the fund for.&quot;    Mr. Vik is out of the country and couldn't be reached for comment, according to his assistant.    The imbroglio is the latest in a continuing takeover dispute involving Mr. Vik, a vice president at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. who manages VBI Corp., a British West Indies investment firm that includes his father and brother. Earlier this year, the Vik group systematically snapped up Scandinavia shares. In July, after it held 48% of the company, it snapped up board seats in a compromise pact that gave it five of the 10 posts and effective control of the fund concern.    Fund specialists said the dispute was uncommon. &quot;In most funds, management owns little, if any, of its stock, including the board,&quot; said Thomas Herzfeld, whose Miami-based management firm of the same name specializes in closed-end funds.    Still, Mr. Vik hasn't been alone in his quest to control a single country fund. T. Boone Pickens III, the youngest son of the Texas oilman and investor, drew public attention in March when an investor group he led offered $536 million for the assets of the Japan Fund, a closed-end fund that invests in Japanese securities. In August, the fund converted to an open-end fund, allowing it to continually sell and redeem shares at prices based on the net asset value of its portfolio.    Liquidation of the Scandinavia Fund, which requires action of the board and approval of two-thirds of all outstanding shares, would be a boon to holders. In liquidating, the fund would sell its shares and distribute the cash to holders at the net asset value, which stood at $8.61 a share last Friday, the last reporting date. That's noticeably above its close on the Amex yesterday.    The fund, which invests primarily in Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and Finnish equities, has assets of $56 million. In July, the fund won approval to invest in Swedish restricted shares, which are typically top performing stocks and normally available only to local investors. It currently is 85% invested, with 11% of its holdings in restricted shares, a fund spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
