It is believed to be the first time a state has attemptedto hold lawyers accountable for environmental crimesallegedly committed by a client.</LP><TEXT>   The case arose when William Scherer, a lawyer at the firmof Sullivan, Roche andamp; Johnson, informed a client's landlordthat the client, a biotechnology company, didn't intend toclean up toxic waste at a laboratory it had operated. Thecompany, InFerGene Inc. of Benicia, Calif., had filed forbankruptcy-court protection.   Under California law, felony charges can be broughtagainst anyone who causes the disposal of hazardous wastewithout a license. According to Solano County deputy districtattorney Mark Pollock, the lawyer's act of writing the lettereffectively abandoned the waste at an unlicensed site, thus&quot;causing&quot; an illegal disposal.   &quot;It's not only that the lawyer assisted in committing acrime. He effectuated it,&quot; Mr. Pollock said in an interview.   Like many state and federal environmental statutes,California's hazardous waste control act doesn't requireproof that violators knew they were doing something wrong.The state must only prove a defendant &quot;should have known&quot;that an unlawful disposal would occur.   Environmental and criminal lawyers said state toxicdumping laws weren't intended to punish attorneys for givingadvice. If a lawyer advises a client to commit a crime, thelawyer can be charged with violating ethical rules, theysaid. A client could also sue the lawyer for malpractice,they added.   Weyman Lundquist, a partner at the San Francisco law firmHeller, Ehrman, White andamp; McAuliffe, said that if theprosecution's theory is upheld, lawyers who representcompanies that have filed for Chapter 11 protection and haveoperated on toxic sites would face a dilemma.   &quot;On the one hand, if they advise a client to clean uptoxic waste, that can be be a crime under the bankruptcylaws: knowingly misusing the assets of a bankrupt estate,&quot; hesaid. &quot;On the other, if they advise a client to leave thewaste behind, they could be convicted under hazardous wastedisposal laws.&quot;   If convicted the defendants, who include the company, someof its officers and Mr. Scherer, could face up to nine yearsin prison and be fined up to $100,000 a day for eachviolation.   Lawrence Callaghan, a San Francisco attorney for the lawfirm, called the prosecution's theory &quot;outrageous&quot; and anattempt to interfere with the attorney-client relationship.He said &quot;the legal advice given was absolutely correct anddidn't constitute any kind of criminal act.&quot;   A spokesman for InFerGene said the company didn't commitany wrongdoing.   ---   UNSECURED CREDITORS' CLAIMS given priority in Philadelphiabankruptcy.   A bankruptcy judge has granted three unsecured creditorsthe right to collect part of the debt owed them by a failedPhiladelphia tobacco and candy distributor before a bank cancollect money it lent to the company.   The decision, made on the ground that the bank actedimproperly, is one of a string of recent cases that reversesthe usual priority among banks and unsecured creditors inbankruptcies.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bruce Fox ruled that MNC CommercialCorp., of Baltimore had used &quot;surreptitious and misleadingmethods&quot; to select the most opportune time to cease makingloans to the debtor, M. Paolella andamp; Sons, and foreclose on itscollateral. The Philadelphia judge decided that three tobaccocompanies should be allowed to jump ahead of MNC to reclaim atotal of $1.9 million in unsecured credit they issued toPaolella in December 1985, a month before MNC forced Paolellainto involuntary bankruptcy by canceling its loan agreement.   In the vast majority of bankruptcies secured creditors,such as banks, are paid before unsecured creditors. Thedecision is also unusual because it defines what kind oflender conduct is unacceptable, said Neal D. Colton, apartner at the Philadelphia law firm Dechert Price andamp; Rhoads,who represented the tobacco companies.   Paolella, formerly the largest wholesale tobaccodistributor in the Philadelphia area, was an asset-basedborrower of MNC, which meant that on a daily basis the bankdecided how much to lend Paolella so that the company couldmeet its expenses.   In December 1985, with MNC's acquiescence, Paolella tookadvantage of an annual special purchase program offered bythe three tobacco companies -- Philip Morris Cos., R.J.Reynolds Tobacco Co. Inc. and the Lorillard Inc. unit ofLoews Corp. -- to stock up on extra inventories beforetobacco prices rose.   The three companies floated Paolella a total of $1.9million in credit, with MNC's knowledge. The judge found thatMNC had already decided to cancel its loan arrangement andwas secretly positioning itself to seize Paolella'shigher-than-usual tobacco inventories in a bankruptcy. HadMNC disclosed its true intentions, the three tobaccocompanies would never have extended the credit, the judgeruled.   Lawyers for MNC said that the bank was operating withinits rights when it refused to reissue Paolella's credit andthat it plans to appeal.   ---   KINDER-CARE'S former president and chairman indicted inDrexel scheme.   Perry Mendel was charged by the U.S. attorney in Manhattanwith one count of tax evasion related to a scheme tomisappropriate securities fees.   The charge alleges that Mr. Mendel, along with formerKinder-Care Inc. officer Richard J. Grassgreen, pocketed$965,000 in fees for, among other things, agreeing to invest$85 million in Kinder-Care funds in debt offeringsunderwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Mr. Mendelallegedly failed to report and pay income tax on his portionof this income.   Mr. Mendel could not be reached for comment.   The charges come on the heels of the announcement thatEnstar Group Inc., the successor to Kinder-Care Inc., hasfiled for bankruptcy-court protection. Both Enstar andKinder-Care Learning Centers Inc. have sued the twoexecutives, charging they breached their duties to thecompany.   As previously reported, Mr. Grassgreen, who resigned aschairman of Enstar in October, pleaded guilty last month totwo counts of securities fraud. Mr. Grassgreen testifedagainst former Drexel junk bond chief Michael Milken at hispresentencing hearing last fall.   ---   LAWYERS FOR STATE officials can sue for fee increases infederal court. A U.S. appeals court ruled that fees paid toattorneys representing state officials should be determinedby the court hearing the underlying case, even if the casewas heard in federal court.   The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Yorkoverturned a lower court decision that a federal judge couldnot resolve such a fee dispute because the 11th Amendment ofthe U.S. Constitution grants states immunity from federalsuits.   Attorneys general typically hire outside counsel when theyhave a conflict of interest in representing certain officialsor when many officials are defendants in a case.   The fee dispute arose in a case in which Rosenman andamp; Colin,a 215-lawyer New York firm, successfully defended SchulemRubin, director of New York's Kosher Law EnforcementDivision, in a suit brought by National Foods Inc. allegingcivil rights violations.   The law firm asked the federal judge who heard the case toincrease its hourly fees for partners and associates to$388.33 and $211.21 from $175 and $135 respectively -- feeswell below the law firm's regular rates. The state challengedthe request and the appeals court ruled that the federaljudge can decide the issue.   The decision could increase the willingness of privateattorneys to represent state officials in potentiallydifficult cases. &quot;This is the fairest thing to lawyers whotake on this obligation,&quot; said Gerald Walpin, a litigationpartner at Rosenman andamp; Colin who represented Mr. Rubin. &quot;Thiswill encourage competent lawyers to take on emergencyrepresentation of a state official who shouldn't be left in alurch because the attorney general has a conflict-of-interestsituation.&quot;   A spokesman for the attorney general's office declined tocomment on the ruling.   ---   NOTED: The Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied anappeal from the National Football League, which sought toreverse a lower-court decision that strips the NFL of itsantitrust exemption. In declining to hear the appeal, thecourt allowed a suit brought by eight NFL players to proceedto its scheduled February 1992 trial date before U.S.District Judge David Doty in Minneapolis. The players arechallenging the league's free-agent system.</TEXT></DOC>
