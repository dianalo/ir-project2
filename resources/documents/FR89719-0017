Andersen (Fishery ManagementBiologist, NMFS) 907-586-7229.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Pacific Salmon Treaty (Treaty)and the Fishery Management Plan for the High Seas Salmon Fishery Off theCoast of Alaska (FPM) govern the salmon fisheries in the EEZ off the coastof Alaska east of 175anddegrees; east longitude. The FMP was developed andamended by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. Regulations implementingthe FMP (50 CFR Part 674) were issued under section 7(a) of Pub. L. 99-5,the Pacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3631 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and under section 305 of the Magnuson Fishery Conservationand Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">Closure of the Chinook Fishery</ITAG>The Secretary issued a final rule, effective June 30, 1989, announcingthe 1989 time and area limitations for the harvest of chinook and otherspecies of salmon for the commercial troll fishery in the EEZ off SoutheastAlaska (54 FR 28423). That rule provided for the closure of the chinooksalmon troll fishery when 221,000 chinook salmon were harvested from thebase stocks.Base stocks consists of those wild and hatchery stocks that were beingharvested in the fishery when the Treaty was signed. Base stocks do notinclude supplemental stocks resulting from salmon enhancement activityconducted by the State of Alaska after the Treaty was signed. Supplementalstocks are identified through the recovery of coded wire tags.No separate harvest quotas were established for supplemental stocks andthe harvest of these fish is permitted as long as the harvest quota forthe base stocks is not reached. Separate harvest quotas are not establishedfor the EEZ and State waters.The predicted total allowable harvest of chinook salmon was 305,200. Thisamount consisted of 263,000 chinook salmon from the base stocks, as authorizedby the harvest quota established by the Pacific Salmon Commission, plusan estimated 42,200 chinook salmon from supplemental stocks.The original forecast for the total allowable harvest of chinook salmonfor the troll fishery was at least 247,000 fish. This amount consistedof 221,000 chinook salmon from the base stocks, as allocated to the trollfishery under harvest guidelines established by the State of Alaska, plusan estimated 26,000 (at least) chinook salmon from supplemental stocks.The 1989 winter troll fishery harvested about 35,000 chinook salmon andan additional 35,00 chinook were taken in the June experimental troll fisheries.The Alaska Department of Fish and Game was managing the 1989 summer trollfishery so that 177,000 chinook salmon would be harvested and thus, a predictedtotal allowable harvest of 247,000 chinook salmon would be achieved.The ADFandamp;G estimates that the summer commercial troll fishery will haveharvested 177,000 chinook salmon by midnight July 13, 1989. The troll harvestguideline of 221,000 chinook salmon taken from base stocks is expectedto be reached at the same time. The Secretary, therefore, closes the commercialtroll fishery for chinook salmon in the EEZ off Southeastern Alaska at11:59 p.m., July 13, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Closure of the Outer Fairweather Grounds</ITAG>A provision of the Pacific Salmon Treaty requires that each party to thetreaty ``minimize * * * all sources of induced fishing mortality * * *of chinook salmon'' (Annex 4, Chapter 3, Paragraph 1(e)). To achieve thisrequirement, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the Secretary areclosing commercial fishing for all salmon species in certain areas knownto have high numbers of chinook salmon. This action is expected to minimizethe incidence of chinook salmon hook-and-release mortality. These areasare known to have a high chinook salmon concentration; if left open, alarge number of chinook salmon will be caught and released with a substantialmortality resulting. The area of the EEZ being closed to all commercial salmon fishing, knownas the Outer Fairweather Grounds, is bounded by lines connecting the followingpoints:<ITAG tagnum="25">Lat. 58anddegrees;46.7andmin172; N., Long. 138anddegrees;54.5andmin172; W.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Lat. 58anddegrees;24.5andmin172; N., Long. 139anddegrees;48.8andmin172; W.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Lat. 57anddegrees;50.0andmin172; N., Long. 138anddegrees;19.5andmin172; W.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Lat. 58anddegrees;15.9andmin172; N., Long. 137anddegrees;21.5andmin172; W.</ITAG>The following Loran C lines are provided at the request of fishermen asestimates of the boundary lines of the Outer Fairweather Grounds. The closedarea is roughly bounded on the northwest by Loran C line 7960-Y-29800,on the seaward side by Loran C line 7960-X-14400, and on the southeastby Loran C line 7960-Y-29150, and on the shoreward side by Loran C line7960-X-14660. The provisions of Loran C lines does not affect the legalboundaries of the Outer Fairweather Grounds and fishermen are cautionedto use these lines and other navigational aids to assure that they arenot conducting illegal fishing activities in this area. Fishermen shouldrefer to NOAA chart 16760.This action is authorized by 50 CFR 674.23 which provides that the Secretarymay modify the fishing periods and areas by publishing a notice in the<T4>Federal Register.</T4> Any modification will be based on a determinationby the Director of the Alaska Region of NMFS (Regional Director) that thecondition of a salmon species is substantially different from the conditionanticipated in the FMP and that this difference requires a modificationof the fishing times and areas to adequately conserve and manage that salmonspecies. The regulations specify the factors that the Regional Directormay consider. The regulations also specify that the Secretary must consultwith the ADFandamp;G before any period or area modifications.In conformity with these requirements, the Regional Director (acting onbehalf of the Secretary) has consulted with the ADFandamp;G, has reviewedthe information on the 1989 salmon fishery to date, and has determinedthat the chinook stocks in 1989 are substantially weaker than the conditionanticipated in the FMP, although some wild stocks are rebuilding underprovisions of the Treaty and although Alaska's new hatchery stocks areincreasing their contribution to the harvest. The Regional Director furtherhas determined that this difference in stock condition requires, in conjunctionwith area closures made by the ADFandamp;G, the closure of the Outer FairweatherGrounds to all commercial salmon fishing at 11:59 p.m. (ADT) on July 13,1989.<ITAG tagnum="85">Possibility of Reopening the Troll Chinook Fishery</ITAG>After the fishery closure, the actual troll fishery harvest of chinooksalmon will be tabulated and the number of chinook salmon taken from supplementalstocks resulting from Alaska's recent salmon enhancement activities willbe determined. If the total chinook harvest by the troll fishery is considerablyless than the harvest guideline, then the troll fishery will be reopenedto allow harvest of the remainder of its guideline number before the trollseason closes on September 20.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>This action is exempt from sections 4 through 8 of the Administrative ProcedureAct, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and Executive Order 12291 because,as is expressly provided in section 7(a) of Pub. L. 99-5, it involves aforeign affairs function. It contains no collection-of-information requirementfor purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act.Section 674.23(b)(3) of the rule implementing the FMP requires the Secretaryto accept and consider public comments for 30 days after the effectivedate of this notice. The aggregated data upon which this closure was basedare available for public inspection at the address given above. If commentsare received, the Secretary will reconsider the necessity for this actionand will publish another notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> either confirming the notice's continued effect,modifying it, or rescinding it, unless the notice has already expired orbeen rescinded.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 674</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Fish, Fisheries, Fishing, Internationalorganizations.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>16 U.S.C. 3631 <T3>et seq.</T3>; 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard H.
