Though virtually invisible to most investors, the privateplacement market is an important source of financing for manyU.S. corporations. It's especially important for companiesthat can't easily raise money with public sales of stocks andbonds, or those that want to keep their financial datasecret.</LP><TEXT>   The new flood of pension money is coming at a criticaltime for the private placement market. Insurance companiesand banks -- the biggest traditional buyers of private deals-- have pulled back sharply from the market in the wake ofproblem real-estate and other loans. Last year, only $118.9billion of new private stock and bond placements came tomarket, according to IDD Information Services. That was down7.5% from the previous year and well below the $165 billionraised in 1988, the private market's peak year.   &quot;We are undergoing a sea change in terms of players in theprivate-placement market,&quot; says Jerome P. Greene ofprivate-placement specialists Benedetto, Gartland andamp; GreeneInc. &quot;So long as the insurance companies, the banks and thefinance companies remain focused on (credit) quality, thepension funds are going to own the market.&quot;   Most small investors are barred from trading in privateplacements. Privately placed securities aren't registered forpublic trading with the Securities and Exchange Commission.That makes it easy for corporations to tailor private stockor bond issues to suit institutional investors.   What has sparked the interest from pension funds? It's thebelief that these private deals offer higher investmentreturns. &quot;We feel strongly that stocks and bonds -- publiclytraded securities -- are very efficient markets,&quot; saysRussell W. Steenberg, who oversees $1 billion in privateinvestments for American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s pensionfund. &quot;In the private placement markets, we feel there areinefficiencies to be captured.&quot;   Pension fund managers discovered the high returns possiblefrom private investing in the 1980s, when they provided muchof the money behind leveraged buy-outs, venture capital andother types of private deals. More recently, pension fundshave shown their interest in private deals by investing incorporate restructuring funds and in venture and buy-outfunds overseas.   Now, some funds are wasting little time in jumping intoprivate placements. In the six months since it decided tostart making direct investments in private placements, the$20 billion Pennsylvania Public School Employees RetirementSystem has put $175 million into three private deals. Thelargest is a $100 million investment in the convertiblepreferred stock of GPA Group PLC of Ireland, the giantaircraft-leasing concern. In addition, the Pennsylvania fundhas invested $50 million in an operator of retirementcomplexes and $25 million in an insurer of college buildings.   With banks and insurance companies largely on thesidelines, &quot;this is a perfect time for pension funds to doprivate deals,&quot; says John Lane, investment chief of thePennsylvania system. It expects to dole out another $225million for private placements by year-end.   Meanwhile, the $67 billion California Public EmployeesRetirement System, the nation's largest public employeepension fund, is launching a program that would eventuallyinvest 3% of its assets in so-called alternative investments,including private placements.   Some big pension funds began buying private placementsyears ago. The giant pension fund for education workers,Teachers Insurance Annuity Association, College RetirementEquities Fund, has more than $12 billion invested in privateplacements. The pension funds of General Motors Corp. andInternational Business Machines Corp. have big interests inprivate issues.   The private placement market was the traditional financingsource for below-investment-grade borrowers until the publicjunk-bond market ballooned in the 1980s. But in mid-1990,insurance regulators adopted a new rating system thatclassified many more debt issues as below investment grade;while many of the newly classified &quot;junk&quot; issues were thesame bread-and-butter private placements that insurers hadroutinely invested in for years, the ratings change came asinsurers were struggling to boost the quality of their loanportfolios. Dreading ratings downgrades and higher reserverequirements, insurers fled the low end of the private debtmarket.   Most pension funds aren't keen to buy the weaker junkcredits abandoned by the insurance companies. But many fundswill agree to take better-quality junk debt if it comes withrights to acquire private equity in the issuing companies.These so-called equity kickers hold the greatest opportunityfor the high returns that funds think they can't earn withpublicly traded securities.   Pennsylvania's Mr. Lane thinks it's &quot;extremely realistic&quot;to expect that annual returns on the fund's privateplacements will average about 25% over five years, far morethan the long-term returns from publicly traded stocks orbonds. ATandamp;T's Mr. Steenberg also thinks that privateplacements can deliver annual returns of 20% to 30% overtime.   Higher returns, however, usually bring higher risks.Callan Associates, a San Francisco pension consulting firm,says that returns from privately placed stock, the type ofprivate security most often sought by pension funds, shouldbeat publicly traded stocks by 50% over the long term, asmeasured by the return of the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stockindex. But that return comes with twice the level of risk,Callan estimates. Returns for privately placed debt shouldtop the Sandamp;P 500 by about 20% -- also with twice the risk.   Veteran investors in private markets warn that they can betraps for the unwary. &quot;It makes sense for the pension fundsto be more active in the private markets in the '90s,provided that it's at sensible valuation levels,&quot; says JohnMyers, executive vice president of General ElectricInvestment Corp., which invests money in private markets forGeneral Electric Co.'s and other pension funds.   Moreover, the surging public market for newly issuedstock, and low interest rates available on publicly tradedbonds, have made terms available on many private deals lessattractive, he says.   Another worry is that pension funds with long experiencein private placements, such as GE, GM and ATandamp;T, have built uptheir investments slowly over years, while newcomers can betempted to rush into deals. Even those funds previouslyinvesting in private pools for such areas as venture capital,real estate and LBOs don't have experience negotiatinglarge-scale investments with hard-nose company treasurers.   &quot;It's truly only a matter of time before the pension fundsexperience a major embarrassment by throwing money at asituation where they do not have the expertise to do thenecessary due diligence,&quot; Mr. Greene, the private-placementspecialist, recently told a New York conference sponsored bythe Institute for International Research.   One private-placement disaster has already surfaced. TheKansas Public Employees Retirement System has lost $125million on its direct placement program, mostly on in-stateinvestments, and another $105 million in investments by theKansas fund is in jeopardy, according to state officials.   &quot;There are tremendous sums at our disposal (to invest),but for the most part, we are understaffed and underpaid,&quot;says Robert Zobel, a 25-year veteran of private markets whooversees such investments for the Wisconsin Investment Board.Nevertheless, with its long experience, he says, theWisconsin public employee pension fund feels comfortable withabout $4 billion, or 20% of its assets, in private deals,including venture capital and LBO funds.   Despite exceptions like Wisconsin, few funds have morethan 5% of their assets invested in private deals. But withpension fund assets now totaling about $3 trillion andclimbing, a 5% allocation would amount to $150 billioninvested in private transactions. The largest 200 pensionfunds had nearly $23 billion invested in private placementslast year, according to Pensions andamp; Investments, a tradepublication.</TEXT></DOC>
