Grace and other members of the Grace family said it holds a 9.4% stake in Regional Bancorp Inc.'s common shares outstanding and is considering making a friendly offer for the company.    In a filing with the SEC, the group said it plans to request a meeting with Regional Bancorp's management to discuss making such an offer, the terms of which it hasn't yet decided.    According to the filing, the Grace group holds 300,000 Regional Bancorp common shares, all purchased from Sept. 30 to Nov. 11 for prices ranging from $14.9375 to $17.125 a share. In over-the-counter trading yesterday, the company's stock was quoted at $17.50 a share, up 37.5 cents.    The group said its offer would probably involve a merger transaction requiring shareholder approval, with compensation in the form of cash or cash and securities. It said it expects to offer Regional Bancorp management the chance to participate. It also said it hasn't sought financing commitments for any proposal.    Officials at Regional Bancorp, a Medford, Mass., bank holding company, declined to comment on the filing. </TEXT></DOC>
