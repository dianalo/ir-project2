This week, Mr. Lowden plans to raise more than $50 million through a new publicly traded partnership that will expand the Sahara Hotel and conduct all the future operations of his company. &quot;We're the first to do this in the gaming and resort industry,&quot; Mr. Lowden says of the giant partnership. &quot;But if we're successful, I think you could see a lot of businesses doing it in the future.&quot;    Mr. Lowden is only the latest to discover the joys of a relatively new form of business organization called the master limited partnership. It looks like a corporation, acts like a corporation and trades on major stock exchanges like a corporation. But it is taxed like a partnership and thus avoids the corporate income tax. Says Mr. Lowden: &quot;It's a real neat operation.&quot;    As master limited partnerships mushroom, however, they are also spreading controversy. Tax experts claim that their growth, which is being fueled by the new tax law, could add billions of dollars to the federal budget deficit. And ultimately, some say, they could lead to the &quot;disincorporation of America.&quot;    &quot;They are just on the ground floor now, but my feeling is if they go much further, it will be hard to put the genie back in the bottle,&quot; says Robert McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice in Washington. &quot;It could become a serious attack on the corporate income tax.&quot;    Assistant Treasury Secretary Roger Mentz, who is scheduled to testify on the subject before a House panel today, is expected to recommend that the tax law be changed to treat publicly traded partnerships as corporations. The change could save the Treasury about $1 billion over the next three years and many billions of dollars in the long run.    House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, struggling to find the revenue required by the congressional budget, is also eyeing the giant partnerships. &quot;If the Treasury convinces us there is a significant potential revenue loss, I suspect we will act,&quot; the Illinois Democrat says.    But some powerful interests vigorously defend the partnerships. Mr. Mentz's position has been publicly attacked by an array of former Treasury tax officials, including Ronald Pearlman and John Chapoton, his two predecessors in the Reagan administration, who now work for law firms that represent partnerships.    And, especially in the Senate, any proposal to tax giant partnerships as corporations will face formidable opposition from oil-state lawmakers, since many existing master limited partnerships are in the oil industry.    Mr. Mentz may also encounter obstacles within the Reagan administration. While Treasury Secretary James Baker has recused himself from the issue -- his former law firm, Andrews, Kurth, Campbell andamp; Jones of Houston, is the nation's leader in arranging publicly traded partnerships -- others in the administration are likely to raise concerns.    At the heart of the controversy is the decades-old debate about the so-called double taxation of corporate earnings. Currently, such earnings are taxed once under the corporate tax and then again if the earnings are paid out to taxpayers as dividends. But a master limited partnership escapes that first layer of taxation; all of its earnings are treated by the Internal Revenue Service as belonging to the individual partners, who must each pay their share of the tax.    There are now 99 master limited partnerships trading on the major stock exchanges, according to Joseph Harvey, an analyst for Robert A. Stanger andamp; Co. Of those, 17 have been started since the first of the year. Although originally concentrated in the oil and real-estate industries, the ranks of publicly traded partnerships are expanding to include companies as varied as part of Pillsbury Co.'s Burger King unit and the Boston Celtics.    &quot;It's a dynamic way of doing business for the future,&quot; insists Dwight Schar, the chairman of NVRyan, a large home builder that converted to a master limited partnership last year. &quot;I think we'll see more and more companies go in this direction.&quot;    The partnership movement dates back to 1981, when a group of existing oil partnerships was combined to create Apache Petroleum, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange. The trend got a boost from the 1986 tax bill, which made partnerships seem more attractive than ever by raising the tax burden on corporations. Corporate taxes were increased by $120 billion over five years, and the top rate was set at 34%, well above the top statutory individual rate of 28%. The 1986 bill also eliminated a loophole known as the General Utilities doctrine, which had allowed corporations to escape corporate taxes when being liquidated.    Still, supporters of the large partnerships insist that fears of widespread conversions of corporations are vastly overstated. &quot;It's hardly a tidal wave,&quot; says Christopher Davis, the president of the Investment Partnership Association. &quot;I wouldn't even put my surfboard on it.&quot;    Advocates also note that publicly traded partnerships give small investors access to the same kind of deals that large investors have always had and will continue to have. &quot;Harry Helmsley and Donald Trump can always team up and work out a partnership,&quot; says Mr. Davis. &quot;But the little guy is going to be cut out of the game if Roger Mentz gets his way.&quot;    And Mr. Chapoton, the former Treasury official, argues that corporations have other ways to avoid double taxation besides rushing to change themselves into partnerships; they can retain their earnings or borrow heavily and deduct the interest, he says. Moreover, he says, the &quot;double tax on corporations does some terrible things, and we shouldn't extend it unless forced to extend it.&quot;    But Treasury officials and others argue that as long as the corporate tax exists, companies shouldn't be given a back-door way to avoid it. &quot;If they want to play with the big boys, they ought to pay taxes with them,&quot; says Mr. McIntyre. Moreover, officials say, the partnerships create huge problems for the IRS, which must collect taxes from thousands of partners rather than directly from a corporation.    Ironically, even some of those who could benefit from publicly traded partnerships favor curbing their use. Sidney Shlenker, the owner of the Denver Nuggets professional basketball team, considered turning the club into a partnership earlier this year but then pulled back, partly out of fears that the Treasury might tax such partnerships as corporations.    &quot;I'm not sure the government shouldn't tax them as corporations,&quot; Mr. Shlenker admits. &quot;That's what they are. All people are doing is finding a loophole to beat the law.&quot;    To be sure, master limited partnerships now account for only $30 billion in assets, compared with $3 trillion to $4 trillion of assets in corporate form. And there are some major impediments to their proliferation.    For one thing, bookkeeping requirements are considerable, since all income and expenses must be divided among thousands of partners. &quot;Accounting is very, very complex,&quot; says John McCormick, vice president of Intelligent Systems, a computer firm that became a master limited partnership on Dec. 31. Moreover, the repeal of the General Utilities loophole as of the first of this year makes switching assets from corporations to partnerships very expensive, since corporate taxes must be paid on the transfer.    &quot;It's very clumsy,&quot; says Gillian Spooner, a partner at Touche Ross andamp; Co. &quot;You are not going to get Exxon or GM to do this.&quot;    Nevertheless, the spread of publicly traded partnerships is clearly continuing. Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., for instance, is turning its home-selling subsidiary into a master limited partnership. And companies like Sahara Resorts are setting up such partnerships to handle new investments. Although the market for publicly traded partnerships has recently softened somewhat -- partly because of fears of congressional action-tax experts expect the trend toward giant partnerships to continue.    &quot;Over time, I think you'll see more and more,&quot; says Ms. Spooner. &quot;It could become significantly bigger than it is at the moment.&quot;    Master limited partnerships can provide the biggest benefit to companies that generate large profits that they intend to pay out to their owners. Those are the companies that are hurt most by double taxation.    Maritrans LP, a partnership formed in April from a subsidiary of Sonat Inc., is an example. The company is a large oil-shipping operation that generates a lot of cash but has little need to invest in new equipment. &quot;In corporate format, it's harder to get the dollars to flow through to shareholders,&quot; says Stephen Van Dyck, chairman of Maritrans. &quot;For us, this is more appropriate.&quot;    With lawmakers facing the need to raise revenue to help close the budget deficit, master limited partnerships are unlikely to survive unscathed. &quot;There's absolutely no question that taxing these partnerships is on the table,&quot; says California Democratic Rep. Robert Matsui. &quot;It would raise money, and we have to come up with $19.3 billion for fiscal 1988.&quot;    The Treasury Department will probably recommend that Congress either exclude existing partnerships from any change in the law or provide a generous transition period for them to prepare for the change. Members of Congress, however, may try to increase the burden on existing partnerships. And there even is some talk on Capitol Hill of taxing all public partnerships, including those that aren't traded on stock exchanges. </TEXT></DOC>
