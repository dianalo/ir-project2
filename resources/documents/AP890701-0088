There were no more guards giving them five minutes to eat at thecrowded U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service detention campnear the Mexican border city of Brownsville, Texas. Aboard the TACAInternational jetliner, they enjoyed courteous service from flightattendants.   No more dressing ``like a carrot'' in the orange INS detaineejump suits issued at the ``corralon'' _ the big corral _ theirnickname for the INS Port Isabel Service Processing Center.   The 59 Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans devoured theairline food on the way to San Salvador.   They clowned and laughed a lot for people who had spenteverything for a better life in the north, and failed.   The drudgery of detention made even the poverty and violence backhome seem better.   ``These are the unfortunate people, no money,'' Isidro Ramirez,an officer at the South Texas immigration jail, said whileoverseeing their departure from the camp. ``The only place they gotto visit in America was this.''   They did not know when they would leave until their names werecalled on a recent day on the camp loudspeakers.   INS officials returned the clothes, money and few possessions thealiens had when apprehended, took a second set of fingerprints,compared faces with booking photos and herded them onto a bus.   The INS Harlingen District in southern Texas is the closest U.S.border crossing point to Central America. The district spent $1.8million last year to operate the detention camp, not includingsalaries, and another $425,000 on deportations, mostly on air faresto Central America.   The deportees included 668 Salvadorans, 317 Hondurans and 312Guatemalans.   Nationwide in fiscal 1988, the United States deported 2,711Salvadorans, 2,049 Guatemalans, 1,312 Hondurans and 36 Nicaraguans.   On the seven-hour bus ride to Houston, Manuel Martinez, 22,lamented his failure to get a job in the United States but lookedforward to seeing his daughter born during his three-month detention.   ``That's why it's not so bad to go back,'' said Martinez, anex-soldier in the Salvadoran army.   He said he fled his home in the eastern province of San Miguelbecause he was desperate for work and because of threats fromleftist guerrillas fighting the government.   Few of the deportees had bothered to apply for political asylumin their appearances before an immigration judge because friendstold them it was not worth suffering an even longer detention onlyto be turned down.   Asylum is granted only to those judged to be fleeing politicalpersecution.   This group of deportees had a false start. Their bus had to turnback halfway to Houston because of flooding.   ``Send the airplane here to pick us up,'' shouted Maria ReynaQuintanilla, 24, another native of San Miguel, when INS officerJoseph Russell announced it would be impossible to get to theHouston airport that night.   ``I have bad luck,'' said Jorge Valencia Marin, 30, who livesnear San Salvador, wondering why he could not even get deported whenhe was ready. ``I was already looking forward to seeing my familyagain.''   The next day, the bus reached Houston. The deportees arrivedabout 1:30 a.m. and slept on the floor of an area the INS leases inan industrial park near the airport.   The airplane flight was the first for most of them.   But not for Juan Montufar Alvarez, 29, a Guatemalan who spent thetrip reading his Bible. It was his third time to be deported fromthe United States and his third plane trip.   At the airport in San Salvador, the Guatemalans and Honduranswere transferred to flights for their countries.   The Salvadorans waited in an immigration line near a wall withposters showing a little girl with one leg and the caption,``Innocent victim of FMLN (guerrilla) mines. What about her humanrights?''   The more than 30 Salvadoran deportees were told to wait at theimmigration desk until the pilot brought their package ofdeportation papers. Then they were waved through, withoutinterrogation or a search of their luggage by the soldiersdownstairs in camouflage gear.   Several had no money and stood in front of the airportbewildered, wondering how they would make it 20 miles to the capitaland then home.</TEXT></DOC>
