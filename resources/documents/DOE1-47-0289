Included in the studyare the Peng-Robinson (PR), the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK), the Schmidt-Wenzel(SW), the Usdin-McAuliffe (UM), the Heyen, the Kubic, the Adachi-Lu (AL),and the Patel-Teja (PT) EOS's. The SW equation exhibits a superior predictivecapability for volumetric properties of condensate systems. The PR equationis found to represent the phase equilibrium behavior of condensate systemsaccurately. In terms of compressibility factors, the SW and PT equationsgive better predictions than other equations.</TEXT></DOC>
