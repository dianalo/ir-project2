That being the goal, Apple has triedto achieve several objectives with System 7.andP;  Apple needs to staytechnologically ahead of the competition across its whole line, and needs  toprovide a platform for a new generation of applications, firing up alethargic market.andP;  And since System 7 is the intended vehicle for reachingboth these objectives, Apple needs to handle the introduction of System 7very well.andM;Fear of System Software UpgradesandM;The handling of the introduction is critical, because Apple needs to pick upthe momentum it lost when Windows 3 beat System 7 out the door.andP;  And if theintroduction doesn't encourage people to upgrade right away (rather thanwaiting for 7.0.1 or 7.0.2, as conventional wisdom dictates), the point atwhich third-party applications arrive that really take advantage of System7's new features will be pushed further off.andM;&quot;The way we have handled system software upgrades in the past has not beenall that stellar,&quot; Espinosa admitted.andP;  But he claims that Apple learned itslesson with System 6.0.andP;  &quot;Our fingers were seriously burned,&quot; he told onemember of the audience.andP;  6.0 was incompatible with a significant number ofthird-party products and did not offer enough added value to justify thehassle of upgrading.andP;  With System 7, Apple has seeded its direct sales sitesand application developers early.andP;  Developers will have had the product fornine months rather than a few weeks.andP;  The sales staff will have the productin beta.andM;Besides having learned its lesson from the 6.0 release, Apple is in adifferent position regarding this release than has been the case before.andO;Usually, Apple system software upgrades have been tied to new hardware andcouldn't be discussed; this time, Apple can talk more freely, and is doingso.andM;The 7.0 release is complex enough to need more in the way of documentation,and Apple is aware of this.andP;  System 7 will be documented in a completelyrewritten system software manual, in a delta guide listing the changes, andin various quick references on specific features.andP;  it will go out to systemadministrators with on-disk documentation, upgrade tips and hints, andcompatibility notes directly from the field.andP;  Perhaps most importantly, Appleis making every effort to solve compatibility problems and list the unsolvedones so that most software will run with System 7.0 when it's released and sothat you'll hear about software that doesn't from Apple before you have tolearn it for yourself.andM;The remote-install capability should ease the installation work of thoseresponsible for more than one Mac.andP;  It allows the system administrator to putthe installer on a server and let the users install the new system on theirmachines over the network.andM;But a smooth introduction alone won't make everyone upgrade.andP;  Although thesoftware itself will be distributed through the usual channels and perhapssome new means at a nominal cost, upgrading will be expensive for some users.andO;System 7 requires a Mac Plus, SE, SE/30, Portable, II, IIx, IIcx, IIci, orIIfx, or any future Mac; a minimum of 2-Mbyte memory; and a hard disk drive.andO;A 68030 CPU or a PMMU is necessary for virtual memory, but machines without a68030 or PMMU will run all other features of System 7.andP;  Espinosa says thatthe goal is to allow the user with 2 Mbyte to print from HyperCard or anapplication of similar size.andM;Anyone who doesn't have such a system will have to buy hardware to upgrade toSystem 7, and that's a serious consideration.andP;  Even more critically, many ofthose who meet the minimum requirements will need more RAM to do seriouswork, and Apple's policy on RAM pricing has a history of being user-hostile.andO;This will have to change, and Apple will have to give users some breaks inupgrading to System 7.andM;This is tough for Apple; it represents a shift in mindset, and those of uswho think Apple needs to get a lot more competitive in pricing shouldcontinue to encourage this transition.andP;  The relatively generous II-to-fxupgrade price is encouraging, and the new low-cost Macs to be announced thismonth should be further evidence that Apple is changing.andM;The other thing needed to make people upgrade immediately is a compelling setof immediate benefits.andP;  7.0 has that.andM;Building a User BaseandM;Espinosa ran through a demo, emphasizing the new features from a userviewpoint.andP;  It's worth examining a few of these immediately-available userfeatures with this question in mind: Does this feature make the user morewilling to spend the money and take the perceived risk to upgradeimmediately?andM;Espinosa started by saying that users at Apple often start using anotherperson's Mac without realizing they're working on System 7.andP;  At first thissounds like bad news: The product does not distinguish itself.andP;  But it'sreally part of the best user feature of System 7: consistency.andM;The Mac has always been a model of user interface consistency, and System 7makes the GUI more consistent at the same time it is becoming more powerful.andM;The clearest evidence of this is the tightening of the definition of iconbehavior.andP;  Now, more than ever before, an icon is an icon.andP;  When youdouble-click on it, it does something.andP;  As before, applications launch andcontainers open when double-clicked, but now desk accessories can be launchedby double-clicking, too, and the trash acts like any other container, ratherthan emptying itself whimsically and relocating itself on the desktop whenyou reboot.andM;The Apple menu is now associated with a folder of icons, and when you put anicon in the folder, it immediately becomes available in the Apple menu.andP;  Youcan put all sorts of things in the menu this way, including applications andAppleShare volumes.andM;The System file, which previously gave an error message when double-clicked,now opens to show its contents, including fonts.andP;  Double-click on a font andyou see an example of the font.andM;Another improvement in consistency is that MultiFinder is always on underSystem 7.andP;  It will always be possible to access the Finder or other openapplications via the icon at the right end of the menubar, which Apple callsa &quot;cooperative multitasking icon.&quot; Since it presents a menu of processes, Ioffer Apple the infinitely more memorable &quot;Process Server.&quot; No charge.andM;The balloon help system is another immediately-accessible advantage of System7.andP;  Click on the help icon in the menubar, and any Finder object you point atdisplays a cartoon-style word balloon explaining what it is and what it does.andO;You can even pull down menus and inquire about individual menu items.andO;Pointing to a grayed (disabled) menu item will bring up a balloon tellingthat the item is grayed because it is not presently available, explaining whyit is not available, and what you need to do to make it available.andM;Any Macintosh user who plays with System 7 for a short time is going to walkaway with the impression that it is more consistent, more coherent, and moreelegant.andM;Also immediately useful to the user is the new file system, built around theAlias manager.andP;  The Finder now finds files.andP;  And users can use aliases tocatalog disks, which is worth the price of a utility alone and easier thanany such utility could possibly be.andM;Outline fonts will benefit users immediately in one way: they'll getsingle-point font increments on screen.andP;  A smart dealer could make a point bydemonstrating this to users, since it distinguishes the Mac interface fromWindows.andP;  Otherwise, the immediate effect of outline fonts is likely to benegative unless Apple can minimize confusion and incompatibility in the useof different font types.andP;  Espinosa described seeing documents with threekinds of fonts (Adobe, bitmapped, TrueType) mixed together.andP;  Apple is atleast aware of the potential for confusion and incompatibility, and has had alot of time to work out solutions.andM;File sharing is another immediate user benefit because it is user-friendly.andO;FileShare works just like the Finder: You just put things in folders.andP;  WithFileShare, users can pass files around, but they can also pass whole harddisks around: A user can log onto his or her own machine from somebody else'swhen he or she is in another part of the building, for example.andM;Espinosa also demonstrated aliasing.andP;  &quot;I can leave my system running,&quot; hesaid, &quot;go across the Charles River to our Cambridge office, find a System 7machine and put my diskette into it, and see an icon of my hard disk back onmy desk in Cupertino.andP;  I can double-click that hard disk and it'll go outover the network, find the right zone, find my machine, log me in, ask for apassword, and open my hard disk.&quot; While the actual functionality is remotelogin with transparent file transfer, it presents itself to the user as: &quot;seean icon, double-click it, and it opens up.&quot; The Macintosh way.andM;So when System 7 is released around the end of this year (if Apple pulls thatoff), the immediate user appeal will be better type, more memory orapplications without more RAM (virtual memory), and more ease of use.andM;Building System 7 AppsandM;Ultimately, what will make System 7 pay off is the new applications that willbe developed to take advantage of its capabilities.andP;  All the nice userfeatures can be viewed as bait to hook as large a user base as possible asquickly as possible for these new applications.andP;  As I see it, Apple hasprovided at least two important categories of support for such applications.andM;The biggest item is interapplication communications.andP;  System 7 has, as I'vementioned here before, several levels of IAC, including live cut-and-paste(Apple calls this  Publish and Subscribe&quot;), in which changes in the sourceare reflected in the destination; AppleEvents, a set of events that can bepassed between applications so that applications can export theirfunctionality to other applications; and low-level inter-processcommunications, which will allow application developers to build tightlyintegrated suites of applications.andP;  Apple sees these capabilities as layingthe groundwork for a new generation of applications: smaller, more focused,and with more opportunity for small add-on products that use thefunctionality of larger applications.andM;The other area of support for a new generation of software has to do withmultimedia.andP;  The new support for sound is impressive, but what's morefundamental is the planned support for time-sensitive information in the formof a set of standards.andP;  The umbrella term for this effort is QuickTime.andM;Apple is soliciting developer input in the definition of both QuickTime andAppleEvents.andP;  Since these technologies will help to define the shape of thenext generation of applications, it might be wise to take them up on this.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
