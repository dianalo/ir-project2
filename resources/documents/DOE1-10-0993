<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-10-0993 </DOCNO><TEXT>The effects of selected environmental parameters (pH, NH/sub 3/, Pb/sup2+/) on the blood of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri Rich.) was determinedas a function of time (4 h to 84 days), concentration (4 stages) andpossible interdependences between the chemical and biochemical propertiesof the water. Complex processes within the blood and the sensitivityof various blood parameters to environmental changes were determinedby simultaneous application of biochemical (alanine aminopeptidase-AAP,{delta}aminolaevulic acid dehydratase-ALA-D) and physiological methods(haemoglobin level HB, haematocrite HK, erythrocyte count ERCS, meanerythrocyte volume MCV, mean haemoglobin concentration in simple erythrocytesMCh, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration MCHC), chemical analysis(Na/sup +/, K/sup +/, Pb/sup 2+/) and morphological techniques (lightmicroscopy, transmission microscopy, scanning electron microscopy).</TEXT></DOC>
