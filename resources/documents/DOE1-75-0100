<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-75-0100 </DOCNO><TEXT>Three seam profiles from the Highveld Coalfield were analysed for theirmaceral composition, with special reference to their proportions of vitrinite,low- and high-reflecting inertinite, as well as of massive, detritaland cellular macerals. Distinct cyclic patterns can be delineated, basedon the vitrinite content, as well as on the ratios of massive and detritalmacerals. The coals consist mainly of detrital macerals and low reflectinginertinite. It is suggested that the coals are hypauthochtonous. Thusthey initially formed under good preservation conditions resulting inhumification and gelification of the major part of the peat. Subsequentlythe peat was transported and redeposited, so that it was physically disintegrated(resulting in high proportions of detrital macerals) and partly oxidized(resulting in a high ratio of low-reflecting inertinite). 7 refs., 6figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
