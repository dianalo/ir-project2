Leonardite is often found as an overburden to lignite deposits,is related to humic acid, and is more oxidized than lignites. Extractsfrom certain fungi such as C. versicolor solubilize leonardite. The biosolubilizationactivity is at least in part enzymatic in nature. A protein which isat least partly responsible for the solubilization effect has been substantiallypurified and concentrated by ultrafiltration and ion-exchange chromatographyfrom the broth of an agitated submerged culture of C. versicolor grownin a defined medium. An in vitro coal biosolubilization assay was usedto establish the effects of various physical and chemical factors affectingenzyme activity, including temperature and the salt and buffer compositionof the reaction mixture. Some initial studies on the mechanism of theenzymatic leonardite biosolubilization reaction are described. 8 refs.,7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
