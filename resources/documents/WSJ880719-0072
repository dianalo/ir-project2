The art: 14 Norman Rockwell originals now hanging in Mr. Posner's Miami Beach office that were bought by Sharon before Mr. Posner took over the company. The money: Some of the $16.2 million Mr. Posner received in salary and bonuses between 1983 and late 1987, years in which Sharon was heading toward collapse.    The trustee, James Toren, also is seeking to get back some of the estimated $4.4 million of Sharon money Mr. Posner allegedly used to pay lawyers in a tax case that didn't involve Sharon. Mr. Posner was convicted in September of bilking the government of $1.2 million of taxes.    A spokeswoman for Mr. Posner declined to comment on the allegations.    Sharon filed for court protection from creditors in April 1987. Mr. Posner has lost almost all of his power at Sharon, though he still remains its chairman. The company is being run by Mr. Toren, who was appointed in January by a bankruptcy court in Erie, Pa.    The trustee's moves spell more trouble for the 69-year-old financier, just months after he completed a stint dishing up food in a Miami soup kitchen as part of his sentence following the tax conviction. He also has been under investigation in the government's long-running insider trading investigation.    The complex Sharon bankruptcy case was further clouded last week by an Environmental Protection Agency suit seeking to prevent the company from starting up long-idled coke ovens unless it first completes costly improvements in pollution control equipment. Separately, a Sharon foreman was crushed to death Friday at the company's Victor Posner works in Farrell, Pa., the sixth Sharon worker killed on the job in the past two and a half years. That record is considered by many steel specialists to be the worst in the industry.    The 14 Rockwell paintings depict steelworkers and various parts of Sharon's mills. Roger Reed, a New York art collector, put their value at about $20,000 each, or a total of $280,000. Mr. Toren's suit seeks to force Mr. Posner to return the paintings to Sharon.    In a second suit, Mr. Toren accuses Mr. Posner of raking in $16.2 million in compensation from Sharon during a period in which the company had $98.2 million of losses and wound up insolvent. For Sharon's two worst years, 1985 and 1986, Mr. Posner received $9.2 million. Losses for those years totaled $97.8 million. In the suit, Mr. Toren calls the compensation &quot;excessive . . . {and} drawn in manifest self-interest . . . with total disregard for the welfare of Sharon&quot; and its investors and creditors.    That suit also alleges that Mr. Posner used Sharon money to pay attorney's fees in his long fight with the government over charges that he inflated the value of land he donated to a Miami bible college and otherwise dodged taxes, which ended in September with Mr. Posner's no contest plea. It further charges him with &quot;grossly&quot; mismanaging the company.    The second suit seeks unspecified damages. </TEXT></DOC>
