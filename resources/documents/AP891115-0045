(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After replacing a flawed computer on itslast unmanned rocket, NASA set Saturday for the launch of the firstof several satellites that will reveal an ``unbelievable view ofthe universe.''   ``Hold on to your hats because this is going to shake up theworld of science,'' program scientist Larry Caroff said of theCosmic Background Explorer spacecraft and four observatories thatwill be placed in Earth orbit during the 1990s.   Saturday's launch of the $150 million Explorer spacecraft _ thecenterpiece of a $400 million mission _ ``is going to begin anexplosion of knowledge about the universe,'' program manager DavidGilman told reporters Tuesday at the space agency's Jet PropulsionLaboratory.   The 4,850-pound Explorer will provide clues to the developmentof the universe by measuring radiation left over from the ``bigbang,'' the explosion scientists say created the universe 15billion years ago.   Gilman said the Explorer will be followed by the launches ofwhat NASA calls its ``great observatories'' _ the Hubble SpaceTelescope next March, the Gamma Ray Observatory in June, theAdvanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility in 1997 and the Space InfraredTelescope Facility in 1999.   ``These are going to provide us with an unprecedented,unbelievable view of the universe,'' Caroff said in an interview.``We will see things we haven't even imagined.''   The Explorer is scheduled for launch from Vandenberg Air ForceBase during a 30-minute period starting at 6:24 a.m. PST Saturday,said Roger Mattson, project manager at NASA's Goddard Space FlightCenter in Greenbelt, Md.   The launch had been scheduled for Friday, then was delayed untilSunday because of a malfunctioning rocket guidance computer. Butthe computer was replaced so quickly last weekend that the launchwas moved again, said Peter Eaton, a NASA rocket official.   The solar-powered satellite will be carried into a near-polarorbit by a 116-foot-tall Delta rocket _ the last unmanned,expendable rocket ever to be launched by the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration.   NASA will continue to launch manned shuttles and possiblyunmanned cargo shuttles with reusable boosters. But Air Force orprivate companies will charge NASA to launch any payloads thatrequire unmanned expendable rockets.   After a 30-day shakedown in orbit, the Explorer will spend up totwo years measuring ``cosmic background radiation,'' which makes upabout 2 percent of the static on a television set. It includesmicrowaves, heat and other electromagnetic radiation given off bythe big bang.   The Explorer will measure ``the collective glow of all the starsand galaxies and whatever else has been there since thebeginning,'' project scientist John Mather said.   He said NASA will share information from the mission with theSoviet Union, which has flown one similar research mission andplans two others.</TEXT></DOC>
