The report, which officially will be presented to Secretary of State George Shultz today, said the president should urge allies to join the U.S. in further economic sanctions if the South African government doesn't take such steps as ending the country's state of emergency, releasing political prisoners and recognizing the African National Congress.    The report is an implicit criticism of President Reagan's policy of &quot;constructive engagement,&quot; which sought unsuccessfully to encourage the South African government to change its apartheid policies by avoiding punitive measures against the white-minority regime. Mr. Reagan was forced last year to impose a series of economic measures against Pretoria when Congress overrode his veto of a sanctions bill.    An administration official said it wasn't certain whether the report immediately would change White House policy. But he said he believed it would increase outside pressure from Congress and the public to take a tougher approach toward South Africa. &quot;These are reasonable men who are saying the president was wrong,&quot; the official said.    Three of the panel's 12 members are issuing a separate report criticizing the effectiveness of sanctions in combating apartheid, sources familiar with the committee's deliberations said. The three members felt the majority report's tone concerning further sanctions overshadowed constructive programs for black South Africans that also were suggested.    The minority report was prepared by General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith, former Undersecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, and former Rep. John Dellenback (R., Ore.). Their dissenting opinion parallels arguments made by the Reagan administration that economic sanctions cause greater hardships for South Africa's black majority than for its white minority, and cause greater difficulties in pushing Pretoria toward liberalization.    The economic sanctions likely would include a partial trade embargo and a ban on new investment and loans to South Africa.    The report includes proposals for aid programs to support and train black South Africans. It also calls for a closer relationship with the African National Congress, the largest anti-apartheid group banned by the South African government, and with other groups representing blacks.    Sources consider one of the report's more interesting proposals to be a program to increase the number of black lawyers and judges. Members of the committee believe that South Africa's legal system has a large degree of independence but that blacks haven't been able to take advantage of it because they lack sufficient numbers of lawyers and judges.    A source familiar with the report said the committee generally didn't support disinvestment by American companies, though disagreements over the report's attitude toward economic sanctions delayed its release.    The committee was appointed in 1985 by the administration as part of an effort to dissuade Congress from adopting tougher measures. The committee's co-chairmen are Frank Cary, former chairman of International Business Machines Corp., and William Coleman Jr., secretary of transportation in the Ford administration. </TEXT></DOC>
