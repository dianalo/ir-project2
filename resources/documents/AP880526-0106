The woman was later found bound and gagged at the home of abuilding security guard and had been raped during her 13-hourordeal, police said.   Police Chief Tony Bouza said the policeman, a 15-year veteran,won't be disciplined for his handling of the Sunday nightkidnapping.   ``There was no dereliction of duty, absence from post or failureto respond,'' Bouza said Wednesday. ``I don't discipline people whoare trying to do their jobs and make a mistake in good faith.''   He also dismissed the suggestion that prompter police actioncould have prevented the rape or at least shortened the victim'sordeal.   ``We could not have prevented the rape, of that I'm sure,'' hesaid. ``By the time the police were able to do anything the rapehad occurred. She had been missing for hours (by the time policewere called).''   The abduction took place about 9 p.m. Sunday in a downtownbuilding where the woman had returned to her office to catch up onsome work, police said. Her husband reported her missing after hewent to pick her up at 11 p.m.   Among the clues brought to officers' attention were blood on thefloor and walls outside her office, scuff marks, and theobservation of the victim's husband that she had apparently stoppedwriting in mid-sentence.   The officer, the senior patrolman at the scene, indicated in hisreport that the woman had probably cut her finger in the office.   The officer notified a homicide detective working theafter-midnight shift, but neither he nor the detective investigatedfurther, police said.   The incident was treated as a missing person case, meaning thatit would not be assigned to a detective until the start of the nextbusiness day, police said.   Two homicide detectives sent to the scene Monday morning quicklyconcluded there was evidence of a crime.   In the meantime, employees of American Security had tracked downthe guard and staked out his house, where he had allegedly takenthe woman after putting her in the trunk of his car.   Company investigators had been alerted when the guard, whoworked Sunday night, returned to the building about 3 a.m.,ostensibly to use a cash machine, and was seen by another guardwith blood on his shirt, authorities said.   Dwayne Alexander West, 24, was arrested Monday and charged withtwo counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.</TEXT></DOC>
