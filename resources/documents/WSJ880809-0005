But what if that includes terrorists?    Fears that the long-running struggle against international terrorism could worsen in a barrier-free Europe, as well as the difficulty of establishing EC-wide immigration and visa rules, could delay or even prevent the elimination of border controls between EC countries. The EC Commission says removing border checks is a necessary psychological reminder that the EC is truly unified. &quot;It's extremely important for Europeans to be able to cross borders without feeling that they are going to a foreign country,&quot; says commission spokesman Etienne Reuter. &quot;The internal market isn't going to work unless this happens.&quot;    Indeed, public support appears strong for a more open Europe. In a recent EC survey, ending border controls was among the 10 most popular aspects of the 1992 program, favored by 64% of those questioned. The commission is producing proposals on right of asylum, visa requirements and other issues, all of which must be worked out before border controls can be eased.    If the commission has its way, people coming into the community will be checked upon arrival, then be free to travel within the EC. This would mean no more long waits at highway border crossings. And air trips within the community would be treated as domestic flights, with no controls for arriving passengers.    But such ideas worry terrorism experts. &quot;International {security} cooperation depends on the ability to monitor terrorists across borders,&quot; says Paul Wilkinson, a terrorism expert at the University of Aberdeen. He cites an incident earlier this year when Spanish and British authorities cooperated to thwart a planned Irish Republican Army attack in Gibraltar.    Europe still has a long way to reach the kind of political and legal unity that would make borders obsolete, Prof. Wilkinson argues. By getting rid of checks prematurely, &quot;you are virtually saying, 'if you have a gun and you want to travel, then come to Europe,'&quot; he warns. Prof. Wilkinson also worries that some EC countries are less rigorous than others in their pursuit of terrorists. &quot;Terrorists can use such places as rest points,&quot; he says.    Under the commission's plans, relaxed controls between member states would be accompanied by tightened ones at the EC's external frontiers. This would boost pressure on the security forces of countries with sensitive EC external borders, such as Greece or West Germany.    But maintaining equal vigilance at all the EC's outside borders would be all but impossible, says Robert Kupperman, a senior analyst at Georgetown University's Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. &quot;Terrorists will go to the softest points,&quot; he says. Without border controls, &quot;it is inevitable that there will be a major terrorist incident.&quot;    Similar concerns are echoed by British officials. Their government is resisting the drive to end border checks on individuals, arguing instead for reduced formalities for EC citizens. Britain doesn't &quot;seek to control the movement of bona fide community nationals,&quot; Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said recently, &quot;but if criminals traveling on false documents or third-country nationals are to be identified, some mechanisms for looking at their documents, however briefly, will need to remain.&quot;    Some EC officials also suspect that Britain has an &quot;island sanctuary&quot; antagonism to the concept of free entry into its territory, even for other Europeans. But British officials reject any hint their views are un-European, saying that ending frontier checks involves many complications for the U.K. Other EC nations rely on identity cards for internal security, for example, but Britons views such documents as an assault on individual liberty. Health issues such as rabies are also a concern.    Ironically, the U.K.'s problems with the proposals don't include its most treacherous border -- between Northern Ireland and Ireland, where passport controls have already been eliminated for U.K. and Irish citizens. Still, British officials cite the Europe-wide threat posed by IRA terrorists as one reason they are reluctant to see controls abolished.    Other EC states also have reservations, though they don't feel as strongly about them as does Britain. Denmark, for example, worries it might have to tighten controls on its non-EC Nordic neighbors. Ireland wants to ensure that freer borders go hand in hand with closer security cooperation among EC nations.    Other obstacles involve aligning definitions of political refugees, work and residence permits for non-EC citizens and immigration rules in general. EC Commission officials are optimistic about overcoming these hurdles, but they admit privately it will be an uphill battle.    Meanwhile, some observers question if ending border controls on individuals is even needed for a single European market. In economic terms, what counts is eliminating red tape for transporting goods, they say. If border checks remain for &quot;individuals, not goods, it will represent an annoyance and an irritation, but not a real economic problem,&quot; says Peter Linton of European Research Associates, a Brussels consulting firm. </TEXT></DOC>
