Two years ago, a gunman robbed $40,000 from the safe ofthe Palace Nightclub here, which Mr. Lidtke operates. Onlytwo months later, masked gunmen held Mr. Lidtke and his wifehostage at their home while accomplices cleaned out the clubsafe again.   Next, two men allegedly told Mr. Lidtke to give up partialcontrol of his business and fork over $50,000 -- or face abeating.   Such horrifying experiences aren't unprecedented. Smallbusinesses have long been targets for such crimes asextortion, fraud, loan-sharking and money laundering --sometimes committed by individuals and sometimes by organizedcrime. Entrepreneurs often wonder how -- or if -- they canfight back.   Mr. Lidtke paid the money the criminals demanded. But,unlike many entrepreneurs, he also went to the police. Hedidn't get total satisfaction, but he didn't waste his timeeither. Three men were eventually indicted for extortion andother crimes against Mr. Lidtke and other businessmen.   In a plea bargain, one defendant, John Scotto, pleaded nocontest to a felony count, possession of a forged documentwith intent to defraud. He also agreed to resign from thestate bar and sell his interest in two restaurants, says JohnMonaghan, the deputy district attorney who handled the case.   The other two defendants, Leonard Passafaro and NataleCardino, pleaded no contest to attempting to extort anotherbusinessman. Each of the three agreed to prison terms of upto 16 months and face formal sentencing within the nextseveral weeks.   Law enforcement authorities apparently fear that thealleged extortion of Mr. Lidtke may have been part of a widerMafia move into Los Angeles in recent years.   According to an affidavit by a Los Angeles PoliceDepartment organized-crime investigator, filed in connectionwith the Lidtke case, police here three years ago launched aninvestigation into &quot;the suspected infiltration&quot; by the Mafiainto Los Angeles area businesses, particularly restaurants,nightclubs and bars.   Early on, the police came across Mr. Scotto, one of thedefendants in the Lidtke case, says the affidavit, filed incounty municipal court here. The 29-year-old Mr. Scotto, alocal attorney, is the son of Anthony Scotto, a former NewYork labor leader, a convicted criminal and a captain in theGambino crime family, according to the affidavit.   In January, 1987, Los Angeles police stopped John Scottowhile he was driving with a reputed East Coast Mafia figure,the affidavit states. The alleged crime figure told anundercover police informant that he was interested in LosAngeles night clubs as a way to launder cocaine profits, thedocument adds.   An attorney for Mr. Scotto declined to comment on anyaspect of this story.   The 54-year-old Mr. Lidtke says thoughts of mobsters werefar from his mind when he got involved with the Palace morethan a decade ago. Mr. Lidtke owned a graphic-design businessand had long been active in efforts to restore Hollywood'sbadly faded glamour.   The Palace was built in the 1920s as one of Hollywood'sfirst legitimate theaters. &quot;Just about every legend fromSinatra and Garland to Armstrong and Crosby performed at thePalace,&quot; says Mr. Lidtke.   Mr. Lidtke says he bought it in 1979 to help save it fromthe wrecking ball. He turned it into an entertainment complexwith a nightclub, restaurant and film and video productionfacilities.   Mr. Lidtke says that besides investing most of hispersonal wealth in the project, he raised $1.5 millionthrough a limited partnership. The partnership, whoseinvestors were mainly New Yorkers, took title to thebuilding.   Despite its aesthetic successes, the project has hadserious financial problems. The company owned by Mr. Lidtkethat manages the Palace recently filed for protection fromcreditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code,its second such filing in the past six years. The company ishundreds of thousands of dollars in arrears on rents to thelimited partnership, a matter that is part of litigationbetween Mr. Lidtke and the partners in a Los Angeles statecourt.   But Mr. Lidtke contends he was making progress in gettingthe Palace on firmer footing when &quot;all hell broke loose&quot; inearly 1988.   For one thing, the limited partnership hired Mr. Scotto torepresent it in the festering rent dispute. He and Mr. Lidtkeinitially worked out a new rent schedule and Mr. Lidtkeagreed to resign as general partner of the buildingpartnership if his company fell in arrears.   Subsequently, the Palace suffered the two major robberies.In the first, Mr. Lidtke says his wife, Beverly, came to theoffice one Monday morning to find an armed robber waiting,who forced her to open the Palace safe.   As a result, Mr. Lidtke says he couldn't keep current onthe Palace's rent, and Mr. Scotto filed an action to evictMr. Lidtke's company. However, according to lawyers for Mr.Lidtke and the limited partnership, the eviction effortfailed because Mr. Scotto served the wrong type of notice onMr. Lidtke.   About two months after the first robbery, the Lidtkes camehome to find two masked robbers with semi-automatic weapons,says Mr. Lidtke. The Lidtkes were bound and held for eighthours while the robbers ransacked the house and phoned aconfederate at the Palace with the new combination to thesafe.   During the ordeal, the two robbers cracked open a fewbeers and chatted with their victims. &quot;They told us they werehired out of New York and paid $10,000 to clean us out,&quot; saysMr. Lidtke. He says the two were familiar enough with thePalace situation to suggest at one point that Mr. Lidtke sellout to his partners in New York.   Though no one has been charged with the robberies, Mr.Monaghan, the deputy district attorney, says he believes thethefts were connected to the extortion effort. However, headds, there isn't any evidence that the limited partners wereinvolved in any wrongdoing. Mr. Monaghan says he believes Mr.Scotto eventually hoped to take over the Palace himself.   In September 1988, two men claiming to represent theinterests of the limited partners contacted Mr. Lidtke andrequested a meeting, says the police affidavit. In his officeconference room, Mr. Lidtke and a partner met with the men,whom police later identified as Mr. Passafaro and Mr.Cardino.   The two demanded that Mr. Lidtke resign as general partnerof the Palace limited partnership and pay $50,000, says thepolice affidavit. The two men told him to go see Mr. Scottoto settle things, according to the affidavit. One also toldMr. Lidtke: &quot;I know where you live, where you go, your wife,everything,&quot; adding that Mr. Lidtke might face a &quot;beating.&quot;Mr. Lidtke says he was scared enough to pay the $50,000.   But he and his partner also had the presence of mind toprovide the police with hard evidence of extortion. The twosecretly tape-recorded the meeting with Mr. Passafaro and Mr.Cardino. Mr. Lidtke says he also had the conference table'sglass top cleaned beforehand to better pick up fingerprintsfrom the men.   After a lengthy preliminary hearing on the charges againstMr. Scotto and Mr. Passafaro, a state court judge foundsufficient evidence of guilt to order a full trial. Then,however, the three reached a plea bargain with the districtattorney.   Meanwhile, Mr. Lidtke says he is still nervous enough tokeep an armed guard at his home.</TEXT></DOC>
