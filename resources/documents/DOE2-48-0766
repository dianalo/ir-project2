The problem of quantumbreaking of supersymmetry is discussed. The Vilkovisky-De Witt effectiveaction in the D-dimensional Einstein gravity with the {Lambda}-term onthe background M-tilde/sub 4/ X T/sub D-4/ is found. An idea is expressedthat a temperature phase transition in Kaluza-Klein theories is possible.For d=5 gravity, the Vilkovisky-De Witt effective aandless;ction on the R-tilde/sub4/ X S/sub 1/, where R-tilde/sub 4/ is fourdimensional curved space-timewith non-zero temperature, is found</TEXT></DOC>
