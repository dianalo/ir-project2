L. 95-604,42 U.S.C. 7901, et seq. (hereinafter, ``the UMTRCA''), authorizes the Secretaryof Energy, in cooperation with affected States, Indian Tribes, and siteowners, to provide a program of assessment and remedial action at designated``processing sites.'' The purpose of the remedial action is to stabilizeand control the tailings and other residual radioactive materials locatedon the inactive uranium processing sites in a safe and environmentallysound manner and to minimize or eliminate potential health hazards. Theterm ``processing site'' as used in the UMTRCA ecompasses both the inactiveuranium milling sites where uranium was produced for sale to the UnitedStates, and other private properties in the vicinity which are contaminatedwith material from the site (``vicinity properties''). The Department is conducting remedial action at 24 designated processingsites located in 10 States and the vicinity properties associated withthose 24 sites, and at the vicinity properties associated with the inactiveEdgemont, South Dakota uranium mill, currently owned by the Tennessee ValleyAuthority. The remedial action is being conducted in accordance with theEnvironmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ``Standards for Remedial Actionsat Inactive Uranium Processing Sites,'' 40 CFR 192, dated January 5, 1983.The EPA standards recognize that in unique situations residual radioactivematerials may be allowed to remain on vicinity properties. These situationsare described in 40 CFR 192.21-22. At the conclusion of remedial action at each processing site, DOE willsend a letter certifying that a single vicinity property or group of propertieshave been cleaned up in accordance with EPA's standards to the participatingState and the owner of record. A copy of a remedial action completion reportwill be enclosed with DOE's letter of certification to the participatingstate agency. Upon receipt of a letter of certification for a vicinity property or groupof properties associated with a processing site, the State will be requiredto take appropriate action to ensure that the land record for each vicinitypropety at which remedial action is conducted is annotated as requiredby section 104(d) of the UMTRCA, 42 U.S.C. 7914(d). This will occur notlater than 6 months after a letter of certification for a vicinity propertyhas been sent to the State, or one year after the effective date of thisrule, whichever is later. <ITAG tagnum="84">Overview of the Proposed Rule </ITAG>This proposed rule interprets and delineates the UMTRCA requirement forthe annotation of land records by States in which inactive uranium millingsites and ``vicinity properties'' (hereinafter, ``processing sites'') arelocated. This requirement is set forth in section 104(d) of the UMTRCA(42 U.S.C. 7914(d)), and applies to residual radioactive material, as thatterm is defined in section 101(7) of the UMTRCA (42 U.S.C. 7911(7)). Today'sproposed rule is intended to ensure that future purchasers of remediatedproperties will be notified of: (1) The nature and extent of radioactive materials removed from the property;(2) The date such work was performed; and (3) The condition of the property following remedial actions. Annotations of land records will be required for sites certified as havingmet EPA standards, 40 CFR 192, under the UMTRCA for the following sitespecific conditions:(1) The vicinity property has been remediated in its entirety and all verificationmeasurements fall below EPA standards.(2) The vicinity property has been remediated; however, residual radioactivematerial remains as permitted under 40 CFR 192.21-22.(3) The vicinity property has undergone remedial action and residual radioactivematerial has been removed in accordance with EPA's standards. However,radioactive materials other than residual radioactive materials derivedfrom the inactive mill site remain on the property.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effect of the Proposed Rule</ITAG>The effect of this proposed rule will be that the land records of all propertiesthat were at one time the subject of remedial action by DOE under the UMTRCAwill be annotated as required by the UMTRCA. The specific procedures bywhich land records will be annotated will be drafted by each State andsubmitted to the DOE for review and approval.<ITAG tagnum="84">Invitation to Comment and Notice of Public Hearing</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit written comments and recommendationsto the address set forth at the beginning of this document. All commentsor recommendations received on or before August 28, 1989 will be consideredbefore the issuance of the final rule.All comments submitted in response to this proposed rule will be availablefor public inspection, during and after the comment period in Room S. 1700,5301 Central Avenue, NE., Albuquerque, New Mexico 87108 between the hoursof 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday to Friday. Procedural rules for thehearing will be announced at the commencement of the hearing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Procedural Matters</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12291.They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in that Order.B. Regulatory Flexibility Act CertificationThe regulations will not have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities.C. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980There are no information collection requirements in the proposed rules.D. FederalismThe principal impacts of this rule will be the annotation of land recordswhere residual radioactive materials were located and where remedial actiontook place as mandated by 42 U.S.C. 7901 of the UMTRCA. The rule is unlikelyto have a substantial direct effect on the States, Tribes, the relationshipbetween the States, Tribes and Federal Government or distribution of powerand responsibilities among various levels of Government.E. National Environmental Policy ActThe proposed rule will have no significant environmental impacts or createadverse effects upon the quality of the human environment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 764</ITAG>Nuclear materials; Uranium mill tailings; Residual radioactive materials.In consideration of the foregoing, Part 764 of 10 CFR Chapter III is proposedto be added as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, July 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John Baublitz,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Director, Office of Remedial Action and Waste Technology.</ITAG>Part 764 is proposed to be added to 10 CFR Chapter III to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 764_ANNOTATION OF LAND RECORDS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">764.1 Scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">764.2 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">764.3 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">764.4 Annotation of land records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C.2011 <T3>et seq.</T3>); Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5801 <T3>et seq.</T3>); Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101<T3>et seq.</T3>); Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (Pub.
