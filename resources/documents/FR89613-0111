For the reasons discussedbelow, the commission is approving the proposal. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26732 (April 17, 1989),54 FR 16438-J. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Description of the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>The proposed rule change will establish an automated procedure wherebyDTC, at the request of a DTC Participant that has a short position in acertain security, may invite tenders to cover the short position of thatDTC Participant from DTC Participants that have a long position in thesame security.\3\<NOTE/> DTC will use an automated means of communication, the PTSsystem,\4\<NOTE/> to invite the tenders. The proposed rule change is the firstpart of a program that is being developed at the request of Participantsand securities industry organizations to eliminate short positions.\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Short positions may arise in any security for a numberof reasons. Short positions primarily are caused by rejects of depositsof securities that the depositing participant already has delivered toanother participant, and by deliveries of securities that, because of latenotification to DTC of partial calls, subsequently are determined to becalled securities in DTC's call lottery. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The Participant Terminal System (``PTS'') is a computerizedcommunications network available to DTC Participants only. Users of another,more simplified DTC communications system called PTS, Jr. also will beeligible to use the proposed procedures to invite tenders to cover shortpositions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ A user advisory committee that includes representativesfrom, among other groups, the New York Clearing House Association and theReorganization and Securities Operations Divisions of the Securities IndustryAssociation has been formed to advise DTC on methods of eliminating shortpositions. Under the proposal, a Participant with a short position in any securitymay use the PTS system to send a messsage to DTC of its desire that DTCextend, on its behalf, an invitation to tender in an attempt to resolveits short position.\6\<NOTE/> In addition, if the participant holds a security similarto the one in which it has a short position, the invitation to tender mayinclude an offer to sell, or swap, the similar security. This incomingmessage to DTC must include the Participant's identification number, date,identification number for the security, security description, quantitydesired,\7\<NOTE/> and contact name and telephone number, and, if a swap isinvolved, also the CUSIP number and description of the substitute security.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ If a Participant has a short position due to an erroron DTC's part, DTC also may use these procedures to invite tenders to coverthe short position. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Although the quantity desired is listed, Participantsare presumed to be interested in negotiating for amounts greater or lessthan the quantity desired to cover the short position. DTC has reserved the period from 4:30 to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) for receiptof messages from Participants with a short position wishing to invite atender to cover short positions. DTC's outgoing messages conveying invitationsto tender are broadcast after receipt of the incoming messages. Invitationsto tender to cover short positions are not broadcast continuously, butare broadcast only once each day. If the short position remains outstanding,the Participant with the short position my send a message to invite tendersto DTC on a daily basis until the short position is covered. Upon receipt of the automated message from Participants with short positions,DTC will identify each Participant with a long position in the specifiedsecurity, and will send an automated message to each such Participant informingthem of an invitation to tender to cover a short position.\8\<NOTE/> Only Participants with a long position in the security willreceive this message. DTC will provide the CUSIP number and security descriptionfor the security (and for the similar security if a swap is involved),quantity desired, date, and a contact name and telephone number at DTC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ DTC will not broadcast outgoing messages until it confirmsthat the Participant sending the incoming message has a short positionin the security indicated on the incoming message. If a Participant with a long position wishes to tender or swap securities,that Participant must contact the specified person at DTC. At that point,the DTC contact person will contact the Participant with a short positionto inform it of the names and telephone numbers of contact persons at eachParticipant with a long position that responded affirmatively to the automatedinvitation to tender message. DTC will relay the names of responding Participantsin the order in which DTC receives the responses, and all responses willbe relayed. At this point, the Participants negotiate with each other the terms ofthe transaction,\9\<NOTE/> and assuming they reach an agreement to trade, arrange forthe actual execution to take place.\1\\0\<NOTE/> DTC will not be involved with the negotiations. Moreover,DTC's rules and procedures will not require Participants to reach agreementto trade. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ For example, Participants must negotiate the quantityand price of securities they wish to trade. Although participants witha short position are presumed ready to purchase amounts greater or lessthan the amount they are short, they have no obligation to do so underthese procedures. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ DTC may be instructed by the Participants to make abook-entry delivery of the security as a result of the transaction. Participantsare reminded that execution of the transaction must take place in accordancewith self-regulatory organization rules concerning order execution <T3>See, e.g., </T3>New York Stock Exchange Rule 390. In cases where a short position is successfully covered through use ofthese procedures, the Participant with a short position will notify DTCby telephone that the invitation to tender is no longer outstanding. DTCthen will inform Participants that received the invitation to tender messagethat the invitation has been rescinded.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. DTC's Rationale for the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>DTC states that the proposed rule change is designed to reduce the numberof short positions at DTC. DTC believes the filing is consistent with Section17A of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>The Commission believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section17A of the Act and therefore is approving the proposal. The Commissionbelieves the procedures for inviting tenders to cover short positions areconsistent with the duties of a clearing agency under Section 17A to facilitatethe prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactionsand to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or forwhich it is responsible.\1\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>section 17A(b)(3)(A) of the Act.Under DTC procedures, Participants are obligated to cover their short positionsimmediately.\1\\2\<NOTE/> A Participant with an outstanding short position must paya daily charge of 130% of the market value of the security until the positionis covered. The 130% charge acts as an incentive for Participants to covershort positions as soon as possible, and also acts as a cushion to protectDTC in the event of a sharp rise in the market price of the security.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ DTC Participant Operating Procedures, section C at7.Notwithstanding the incentives inherent in the 130% charge, certain securitiesmay be difficult to cover and the short position may be outstanding forseveral months.\1\\3\<NOTE/> Moreover, it may be difficult and time-consuming for a Participantwith a short position in a small, thinly-traded issue to locate securityholderswilling to sell their positions, even if the buyer were willing to paya substantial premium over the current market price.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ For example, thinly traded securities and certain municipalsecurities that were issued to fund a particular purpose may be in shortsupply.Short positions in a depository also may create inventory deficienciesin the security so that certificates may not be available for withdrawalfrom the depository by Participants with a long position in that security.\1\\4\<NOTE/> If such a Participant wishes to withdraw securities thatDTC does not have in its vault, DTC generally must undertake to obtainthe securities, either by demanding delivery from the Participant witha short position, or by buying sufficient shares or bonds to satisfy thewithdrawal request and charging the Participant with a short position.If the Participant with a short position, for any reason, fails to satisfythe delivery or payment obligation, DTC may be liable for any shortfallin excess of the defaulting Participant's assets available to DTC.\1\\5\<NOTE/> In these circumstances, DTC could choose to use retainedearnings to cover the loss or to allocate the resulting loss to all Participantson a <T3>pro rata</T3> basis.\1\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ This would occur only where the short position representsa substantial proportion of the issue at DTC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ The risk of loss seems to be remote, given that DTCcollects a 130% charge that is marked to the market daily on short positions.Thus, the risk is greatest when there has been a rise in the market priceof the security above 130% of the amount DTC last collected from the Participantwith a short position.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ In addition, if the market price of the security hasrisen sharply to the point that the Participant with a short position isunwilling to pay the market price, a legal dispute over the liability tocover the short position could develop. Theoretically, DTC also is at riskfor the entire market price in these circumstances.In its filing, DTC estimated that short positions currently exist in approximately3000 securities, and are valued at approximately $90 million. At the requestof its Participants and securities industry organizations, DTC has developedthese procedures that enable Participants with short positions to locateParticipants with long positions in the security. DTC is in a unique positionto know the identity of Participants that are long in a certain security,and has determined to use its facilities for automated communication ofinvitations to tender. The determination to invite tenders is made solelyby the Participant that is short in a security, and the determination totender is made solely by the Participants that are long in the security.DTC's function is to communicate the wishes of the Participants, keepingthe identities confidential until the Participants with a long positionrespond to the invitation to tender. DTC has estimated that the proceduresfor invitations to tender to cover short positions may eliminate from 10%to 15% of all short positions currently outstanding.\1\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ <T3>See </T3>DTC Memorandum to Participants, dated January 30, 1989.The Commission believes significant benefits will result from DTC's effortsto reduce or eliminate short positions. Participants with short positionswill be able to locate interested security holders of the security (whoalso are DTC Participants) to negotiate a trade, and potentially will beable to cover more quickly, thereby avoiding the risk of a large move inthe market price of the security. Reducing the number of short positionsmay help to reduce the number of inventory deficiencies at DTC, therebyreducing processing problems. Fewer short positions also will help DTCand Participants to avoid the financial risk associated with short positions.For these reasons, the Commissioin finds DTC's procedures to invite tendersto cover short positions to be consistent with the requirements of Section17A of the Act that a clearing agency have the capacity to be able to facilitatethe prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securites transactionsand to safeguard securities and funds in the clearing agency's custodyor control or for which it is responsible.In order to monitor the extent to which short positions continue to existat DTC and to monitor the effectiveness of the procedures approved in thisproposed rule change, the Commission expects DTC to provide the followinginformation, on a quarterly basis: (1) The total number and value of shortpositions on the last day of the quarter; (2) the type of security involvedin each such short position (<T3>e.g., </T3>municipal, equity, or corporate bond); (3) the number ofinvitations to tender to cover short positions extended through these proceduresduring the quarter, including both the number of invitations extended toDTC by Participants with a short position and the number of responses byParticipants with a long position to invitations extended by DTC; (4) thenumber of short positions eliminated through use of these procedures duringthe quarter; and (5) the identities of the Participants that successfullyused these procedures to cover short positions or to tender securitiesand the securities issues involved. DTC should file such information ona quarterly basis until notified otherwise.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion</ITAG>On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rulechange is consistent with the Act and, in particular, with section 17A.The Commission believes the proposal is consistent with a clearing agency'sduties to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement ofsecurities transactions and to safeguard securities and funds in its custodyor control or for which it is responsible.<T3>It is therefore ordered, </T3>pursuant to section 19(b) of the Act,that the proposed rule change (SR-DTC-89-07) be, and hereby is, approved.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority (17 CFR 200.30-3).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
