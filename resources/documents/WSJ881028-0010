Berger was named president and chief operating officer of the newly formed MGM/UA film group of MGM/UA Communications Co. The Beverly Hills, Calif., movie and television concern said the move, which had been widely anticipated, is part of its plan to consolidate and restructure its feature-film division.    For two years, Mr. Berger has been executive vice president, production, at the MGM Pictures Inc. unit of MGM/UA Communications. MGM Pictures will become the core of the new film group under the restructuring, in which MGM/UA Distribution Co. also will report to Mr. Berger.    Several key executives have left MGM/UA Communications in recent months amid turmoil over the company's future. Investor Kirk Kerkorian, who controls the debt-laden company, has been trying to sell parts of it or restructure it. Last month, MGM/UA said it will no longer make movies through both MGM and UA, which have operated as separate production companies; instead, movie production will occur only at the MGM unit. Mr. Berger will work on consolidating those operations into one entity. </TEXT></DOC>
