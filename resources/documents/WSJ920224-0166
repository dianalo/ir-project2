The accounting firm denied the charges and said it wouldchallenge the allegations in court.</LP><TEXT>   Ernst andamp; Young was the auditor for the Rhode Island Share andamp;Deposit Indemnity Corp., whose reserves were severelydepleted following the failure of Heritage Loan andamp; InvestmentCo., a small bank whose president disappeared along withmillions of dollars from the bank.   Risdic, as it was known, went out of business followingruns on deposits at other credit unions and small banks,prompting Rhode Island Gov. Bruce G. Sundlun to close its45-member institutions in January 1991.   Although many of the institutions have since reopened withfederal deposit insurance, some of the largest, with hundredsof millions of dollars in depositors' money, remain closed.   The suit, which seeks class-action status, was filed instate Superior Court here. It alleges that Ernst andamp; Young wasnegligent for not discovering and disclosing seriousirregularities in loan practices and insufficientdocumentation at Risdic. The suit was filed on behalf ofdepositors in nine of Risdic's 35 credit unions, receivers ofthose credit unions, the state Attorney General's office, anda state agency seeking depositors' money.   Mort Meyerson, a spokesman for Ernst andamp; Young, said thecompany's role as auditor &quot;in many instances was severelylimited by state requirements which called for audits not ona yearly basis but every three years. In fact, a number ofcompanies had not been audited for well over a year precedingthe collapse.&quot;   Ernst andamp; Young was also auditor for some of the Risdicmember institutions, but it said that it didn't &quot;do any workfor Heritage where a massive embezzlement also contributed tothe crisis.&quot;   The accounting firm said the lawsuit was &quot;misdirected,&quot;asserting that state auditors had a &quot;more pointed role . . .of assuring the safety of these institutions.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
