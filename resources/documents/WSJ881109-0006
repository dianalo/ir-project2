But the dollar gave up early gains.    At the close of morning trading, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues stood at 28162.25, up 154.98 points, its highest level since August. Trading volume was moderate. The U.S. currency was changing hands at about 126 yen -- up from 125.52 yen at the opening and 125.70 yen late Tuesday in New York -- before slipping to 125.10 in active trading at the close of the morning session. It closed at 124.73 yen in Tokyo Tuesday.    Traders said investors were primarily responding to the U.S. election and to Emperor Hirohito's medical condition, which remains serious but slightly improved. </TEXT></DOC>
