The newspaper said it was convinced the communique was authentic.It did not say how or where the statement was obtained.   A long declaration signed by the front was found among theguerrillas who were killed or captured at the 3rd Infantry Regimentat La Tablada on the outskirts of Buenos Aires during a 27-hourbattle Jan. 23-24.   Twenty-eight guerrillas and 10 soldiers and police were killed,and 63 troops were injured. Fourteen commandos were captured.   Spokesmen for Argentina's ministries of defense and interiordeclined to comment on the statement and said there probably wouldnot be an official response.   The communique repeated parts of the declaration that said thegroup acted to prevent an imminent right-wing coup and crackdown onleftist activists. No evidence was offered to back the claims.   It said 46 front members with grenade launchers andground-to-ground missiles staged the raid. The statement said moreattacks are planned.   The front, recently formed and little known, is thought to besmall, but Argentine officials do not discount the possibility ofanother armed attack by it or a related group.   ``The motivation of our companions ... is the increasing miseryof the people,'' the statement said. ``In a country with 50 millionhead of livestock, every day children die of hunger. ... Retiredpeople don't earn enough to eat.   ``A future of peace for our country will only be possible ifmeasures are taken that assure a life of dignity for the people,justice realized and criminals punished.''   The Argentine government said the front is composed of leftistsubversives from the Everyone for the Country Movement and formermembers of the disbanded People's Revolutionary Army, which openlyfought in the 1970s against Argentina's then-military government.   However, members of the Everyone for the Country Movementdenounced the incident and deny involvement, saying members such aslawyer Jorge Banos who participated did so on their own.   The communique did not mention the man Argentine officials sayorganized and possibly led the assault, former People'sRevolutionary Army leader Enrique Gorriaran Merlo, for whom anarrest warrant was issued last week.   President Raul Alfonsin of Argentina formed a National SecurityCouncil to assess the risk of leftist subversion and canceled aplanned trip to attend today's inauguration of President CarlosAndres Perez of Venezuela.   Attorney General Andre D'Alessio said last week that furtherassaults cannot be discounted. Security precautions for the 14guerrillas under arrest are tight.</TEXT></DOC>
