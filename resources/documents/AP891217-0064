(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Recreational shooting of assault riflesis going out with a bang in California.   A state ban on more than 50 varieties of the powerful weaponstakes effect Jan. 1. More than 200 people gathered on a windsweptridge in this town about 50 miles north of San Diego on Saturday toget in one last round of gunfire.   ``I just had to get my hands on an Uzi one more time,'' saidRobert Anderson, a self-described ``gun nut'' who paid a $12admission fee and up to $1 per round to fire a variety of themilitary-style rifles.   Cathy Tolly, a 26-year-old registered nurse who helped organizethe shoot, called it ``a last hurrah for law-abiding citizens whohappen to like assault-type weapons.''   ``Once the ban takes place, you won't see events like thisanymore,'' she said.   The state Legislature enacted the ban after a drifter toting anAK-47 assault rifle shot and killed five children and wounded 30other people in Stockton last January.   Angry gun enthusiasts said the ban would do little to stem suchshootings.   ``They're kidding themselves if they think taking away assaultweapons is going to lessen the crime problem,'' said Bart Montier,who brought an antique cannon to the shoot. ``The whole thing'sabsurd. You're not going to see gang members turn in theirweapons.''   Montier said he came to the shoot try out an Israeli Gallilassault rifle.   ``Now that's a gun,'' he exclaimed after firing several roundsinto a row of clay pigeons set up against a hillside.   Nearly 40 high-performance weapons were available for shooting,including more than two dozen types of assault rifles and anassortment of pistols and shotguns.   Elodie McKee of Burbank _ who wore a T-shirt reading, ``Just SayNo to Gun Control _ said the shoot was a way of dressing downgun-control advocates.   ``Just by showing up here I think we make a statement,'' saidMs. McKee.   ``These guns have gotten such a bad rap that a lot of (gun)enthusiasts would prefer to just go into hiding and not mentionthem,'' said T.J. Johnston, another organizer. ``But I don't feelthat way. That's why we held this thing, to show people whatthey're going to be missing.''</TEXT></DOC>
