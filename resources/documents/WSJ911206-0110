The advance is based on &quot;porous silicon,&quot; which has causeda flurry of excitement among scientists in the months sincethe discovery by a British team that it glows when lasers areshone on it. The phenomenon has suggested that silicon can beused in superfast communications and computer systems thatuse light instead of electricity to carry information.Gallium arsenide and other light-emitting materials proposedfor such &quot;optoelectronic&quot; devices are costlier than siliconand trickier to mesh with electronic circuits.</LP><TEXT>   But a second advance has been needed to realize silicon'snew promise as a basis for optoelectronics: the ability tostimulate light emissions from it with electricity. Thatwould enable scientists to readily couple optical andelectronic devices. One payoff might be chiplike integratedcircuits in which electrically encoded information istranslated by porous silicon into light-encoded data, whichcould be sent at high speed between different computers orcomponents within the same computer.   This week, separate teams at International BusinessMachines Corp. and Spire Corp., Bedford, Mass., reported at ameeting of the Materials Research Society here that they havemade simple devices with porous silicon that emit light whenstimulated with electricity. A German team at the Institutefor Solid State Technology in Munich reportedly has made asimilar finding.   Scientists don't yet understand the mechanism underlyingporous silicon's light emission. The material is made with anacid-etching process that leaves a network of countless tinypores in a thin film of the silicon. The material has beenknown since the 1950s, but scientists didn't realize it couldemit light until U.K. researchers reported last year that alaser light of a certain color shone on samples of thematerial was re-emitted with a different hue.   The IBM team, led by Subramanian Iyer, fabricated itssandwichlike light-emitting device by etching an area ofporous silicon next to a nonporous region. Spire's team madea similar sandwich by depositing a layer of a transparentelectrical conductor on a porous silicon sample, saidFereydoon Namavar, one of the Spire researchers. Reddishlight emitted by the silicon &quot;was clearly visible to thenaked eye&quot; through the transparent layer when voltage wasapplied to the device, he said.   Several hurdles still must be overcome to put poroussilicon to practical use. Its ability to emit light fadeswhen the substance is exposed to air, so engineers probablywill have to find ways to encapsulate it, said Vijay Kesan,one of the IBM researchers. Researchers also need a betterunderstanding of the underlying mechanism to make deviceswith desired specifications, such as higher efficiency inconverting electrical energy to light.</TEXT></DOC>
