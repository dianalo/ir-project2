Oneof the major objectives of this study is to determine whether politicalinstability had a significant impact on the oil market during the 1972-83period. Secondly, there were very important changes that took place withinthe market - considerable reduction in the non-communist world's oilconsumption, increase in production outside OPEC, reduced OPEC marketshare and capacity use, increased sale of oil directly by OPEC ratherthan through the oil multinationals, and nationalization of the assetof the latter within OPEC. Within the empirical literature some attentionhas been paid to the first four changes. The last two changes, however,have generally been assumed to be insignificant. Consequently, the secondobjective is to determine whether the change of the distribution of ownershipwithin and direct marketing by OPEC itself have had a significant impacton the official price of OPEC crude. The third objective is improvedspecification of past models of the world oil market through considerationof the influences mentioned above. Results of the study show that politicalinstability, contrary to popular opinion, did not have a significantimpact on the market during the 1972-83 period.</TEXT></DOC>
