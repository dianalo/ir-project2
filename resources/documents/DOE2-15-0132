They were determined with LiF(Mg, Cu, P) powerthermoluminescent dosimeters and a tissue-equivalent anthropomorphicphantom. Actual examination conditions and the distributions of the surfaceexposure of the examinees were simulated in the experiment using phantom.Weighted dose equivalents were calculated with the weighted factors givenby Drexler. The mean weighted dose equivalent of examinees from outpatientchest fluoroscopy and mass chest fluoroscopy per person per examinationwere 0.37, 0.18 mSv for male and 0.31, 0.15 mSv for female, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
