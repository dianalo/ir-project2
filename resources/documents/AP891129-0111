TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Despite a long history of supporting LebaneseChristians, Israeli officials say they won't intervene this time todefend Christian Gen. Michel Aoun from Syrian attack.   The bitter experience of Israel's occupation of Lebanon from1982-85 is largely responsible for the change in policy.   However, the Israelis have issued new warnings to Syria aboutmaking moves they say would endanger Israel's security and itsnorthern border.   For example, Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun, the Israeli air forcechief, said on armed forces radio Wednesday that surprise flightsby Syrian warplanes over Lebanese territory where Israelisroutinely patrol could lead to clashes.   Referring to reports that a Syrian MiG-23 had buzzed Aoun'spresidential palace in Baabda, Bin-Nun said: ``There is no doubtthat entrances like this to Lebanon can result in a clash, evenunwanted.''   He hinted at diplomatic contacts to prevent greater tensions andsaid, ``We are trying to make sure that the Lebanese do not get usinvolved in a war that we don't intend, and we hope we will succeedin that.''   Israel has insisted it needs a clear view from Lebanon'sairspace to protect its border from attacks by Palestinian andIranian-backed Shiite Moslem guerrillas. It also has used the skiesto launch 15 air raids on guerrilla targets this year.   Officials have said Israel would not tolerate Syrian troopsmoving south of Sidon and the Awali river, about 25 miles north ofIsrael's border, or into areas Israel evacuated in June 1985 at theend of the three-year occupation. Those areas include the BekaaValley.   The occupation produced a consensus that is strongly againstrenewed Israeli involvement. The war cost the lives of 650 Israelisoldiers, damaged Israel's image abroad and caused deep politicalsplits at home.   Israel invaded Lebanon in June 1982 following clashes in whichIsraeli troops went to the defense of Christian militiamen beingattacked by Syrian forces.   Israel threw its military backing and political support toBashir Gemayel, a Christian militia chief. But Gemayel wasassassinated in 1982, reportedly with Syrian involvement, andIsrael's hopes for a friendly Lebanese government were undone.   The Christian militia's refusal to play a major role in drivingout Palestinian guerrillas also caused deep resentment in Israel'sarmy.   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the chief of staff, said last week thatIsrael had no plans to intervene in the current standoff betweenAoun and Syrian troops unless its own security was threatened.   ``As a matter of principle and policy, we do not involveourselves in Lebanon, as long as there is no Syrian threat or otherthreat along our northern border,'' he said.   One senior Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymitysaid Israel would not support Aoun just because he was a Christianleader.   ``We are tired of backing losers in Lebanon,'' the official said.   However, there was lingering support among some Israelis forAoun's anti-Syria campaign, especially in the right-wing led byPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.   Rafael Eytan, a former chief of staff and now a member ofparliament, said Wednesday that Israel should support Aoun.   He said Syrian gains in Lebanon ``will bring increased pressureon us in southern Lebanon,'' where Israel still supports a2,500-member Christian-led militia known as the South Lebanon Army.</TEXT></DOC>
