Employee fraud, abusive insidertransactions, check kiting schemes, money laundering and the like can beserious threats to a bank's security and may undermine the confidence andtrust that individuals and businesses place in the banking industry. TheOCC is primarily concerned with criminal transactions sufficient in sizeor number to impact the safety and soundness of the bank, patterns of criminaloffenses, crimes committed by bank officials, and the adequacy of the bank'ssecurity systems and internal controls. The law enforcement community needsto receive reports, shortly after a crime or suspected crime has been discovered,which contain sufficient information to determine whether the matter warrantsinvestigation and prosecution.A working group was formed in December 1984 to address problems and promotecooperation toward the goal of improving the federal government's responseto white collar crime in federally-regulated financial institutions. Theworking group is composed of senior officials of the federal financialinstitution regulatory agencies and the Justice Department. The workinggroup monitors the criminal referral process and has recommended furtherimproving and coordinating the criminal referral system now in use by allfederally-insured financial institutions and the regulatory agencies. On July 17, 1986, the OCC published a final rule in the<T4> Federal Register </T4>(50 FR 34857) pertaining to 12 CFR Part 21_MinimumSecurity Devices and Procedures and Reports of Crimes and Suspected Crimes.That final rule eliminated the former 12 CFR Part 7 reporting requirementand imposed a new Part 21 criminal referral reporting requirement uponall national banks. Based upon the OCC's experience over the past two years,certain needed revisions and clarifications were incorporated into an interimrule which became effective April 11, 1988. (53 FR 7881.) After reviewingthe comments received in response to the interim rule, OCC has determinedto formally adopt the interim rule as a final rule. The Discussion of Commentssection below summarizes the comments received and provides additionalinterpretive analysis for national banks. The goals of this final rule are to improve the information quality ofcriminal referrals, making the referrals more useful, to clarify the requirementfor reporting financial crimes that result in no direct loss to the bank,and to raise certain of the thresholds for reporting requirements for nationalbanks, making the reporting process more efficient and economical for thebanks. These changes are designed to facilitate the assessment and investigationof possible criminal matters, aid in the identification of patterns ofcriminal misconduct, and improve the OCC's ability to track the dispositionof criminal referrals. <ITAG tagnum="84">Criminal Referral Forms (Short and Long) </ITAG>Section 21.11 requires a bank to file a Criminal Referral Form to reportknown or suspected crimes to the OCC. The OCC Criminal Referral Form hastwo formats_a short form (CC-8010-08) and a long form (CC-8010-09). The``short form'' requires a bank to report the basic facts of the known orsuspected criminal transaction: the approximate date and dollar amountof the known or suspected criminal transaction, the type of crime (embezzlement,check kiting, money laundering etc.), a brief summary of the violation,and where known, the identity of any person suspected. The ``long form,''an expanded and more detailed report, is required only in those situationswhere the transaction or suspected violation exceeds $10,000, or for anytransaction involving a bank insider (i.e., an executive officer, director,or principal shareholder) as defined at 12 CFR 215.2. It is estimated that the short form will be used for 75% of the reportssubmitted. This estimated percentage on the use of short forms has declinedfrom the 95% figure cited in the July 1986 final regulation, due to theOCC's decision to raise the threshold reporting requirement (from $2,500to $5,000) for the reporting of mysterious disappearances, unexplainedshortages, and known or suspected crimes where no suspect has been identified.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>The OCC received six comments on the interim rule: five from national banksand one from a bank trade association. While the comments generally welcomedthe changes made in the reporting requirements, (particularly OCC raisingthe threshold from $2500 to $5000 for the reporting of suspected crimeswhere a bank has no suspect), several areas of concern were raised by thecommenters which are addressed and clarified below. The major focus ofthe commenters' concerns was:(a) Clarifying the reporting requirements concerning known or suspectedviolations of the money laundering and bank secrecy statutes; (b) Reducing the overall criminal referral reporting burden on nationalbanks; (c) Minimizing potential bank liability under the Right to Financial PrivacyAct (RFPA); and (d) Providing more information to national banks on the nature and scopeof the underlying criminal violations upon which the banks are obligatedto prepare criminal referrals. <ITAG tagnum="84">Money Laundering/Bank Secrecy Referrals </ITAG>Several commenters sought additional clarification concerning OCC's newrequirement that national banks file criminal referrals in situations where,although no loss has been recognized by the bank, violations of the moneylaundering and/or Bank Secrecy statutes are known or suspected to haveoccurred, with the bank being used as a conduit for those currency transactions.Two commenters expressed concern that this new OCC filing requirement willduplicate the Currency Transaction Report (``CTR'') filings already requiredby the Treasury Department, particularly in situations where money launderingis suspected. Under this final regulation, banks are required to file criminal referralsonly where there is a reasonable basis to believe a criminal violationhas occurred. The fact that a customer engages in sizable cash transactionsat a bank does not, in and of itself, provide a reasonable basis for concludingthat a money laundering or currency structuring crime has been perpetrated.The bank must consider the size, frequency, and nature of these transactionsand conclude, on a case by case basis, whether there is a reasonable basisto believe that a violation of the money laundering or Bank Secrecy statuteshas occurred. CTRs must be filed based solely on a determination by thebank of the dollar volume of currency transactions conducted by a particularcustomer on each business day. Criminal referral forms, on the other hand,must be filed regardless of the dollar amount of the cash transactions,where the bank has a reasonable basis for suspecting a criminal transactionhas occurred. Financial institutions serve a critical role in the detection and reportingof money laundering crimes. Due to the inherent nature of money launderingand currency structuring, without input from banks, the law enforcementcommunity would be severely hampered in investigating and prosecuting violatorsof the money laundering statutes. The objective of this regulation is notto ``deputize'' every teller in every national bank, nor is it to placethe bank in a position of reporting every customer that looks ``suspicious''or deals in large amounts of cash. Rather, the regulation is intended tofocus the bank's attention on the reality that these crimes may be occurringat their institutions and to require criminal referrals where bank personnelhave a reasonable basis for believing that a bank customer is engaged inactivities that may violate the money laundering or Bank Secrecy statutes.Where a bank has a reasonable basis for suspecting a customer is engagedin money laundering or currency structuring, the bank must file a criminalreferral. While there is no requirement that the bank immediately ceaseengaging in business with that customer or that the bank close out thatcustomer's accounts, the Bank should be aware of the potential civil andcriminal liability it may face if it is linked to money laundering or structuringof currency transactions. A bank that suspects a customer of structuringor money laundering should ensure that it does not serve as a conduit forany additional suspected criminal transactions. Where a bank suspects oridentifies a pattern of money laundering transactions, or otherwise considersimmediate action to be appropriate, prudent action includes immediatelycontacting the IRS at 1-800-BSA-CTRS, or the Criminal Investigation Divisionof the bank's local IRS office, placing them on notice that this activityis occurring, and obtaining their input concerning how best to handle thesituation. National banks are not required to report every act that has some potentialto be a crime. The regulation requires the bank to decide if there is areasonable basis to believe a crime has been committed, and if so, determinewhether that suspected criminal transaction meets one of the criteria requiringthe filing of a referral. <ITAG tagnum="84">Reducing the Filing Burden </ITAG>Several commenters urged the OCC to further elevate its reporting thresholdin order to further  reduce the burden of preparing and filing criminalreferrals on national banks. In this final rule, OCC has again modestly raised the threshold triggering its reporting requirements. OCC is concernedwith the burden of these filings and expects the final rule to result ina net decline in a bank's reporting obligation. The OCC could not raise the thresholds higher because the information currentlycollected is being utilized by the OCC, Department of Justice and the IRS.Particularly in light of the FBI's computerized retrieval system for trackingcriminal activity, it is increasingly likely that individuals who perpetrateeven relatively small dollar crimes at different financial institutionswill be tracked and may be prosecuted. Of course, not every criminal referralwill result in a prosecution. However, the more detailed the referral,the more useful the information will be for law enforcement purposes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) Concerns </ITAG>Two commenters expressed RFPA concerns about the interim rule. One soughtinclusion of the names of the various agencies that may receive the criminalreferral forms in the regulation rather than just in the distribution listson the criminal referral forms. The commenter also sought the inclusionof additional government agencies (especially U.S. Customs) in the regulationand on the distribution list. The second commenter requested that an explicitreference to the RFPA be included on the forms, particularly 12 U.S.C.3403(c) which exempts financial institutions from RFPA liability if theynotify Government authorities of possible violations of any statute orregulation. The first commenter raises an important point. Namely, that the distributionlist on the forms is not all inclusive. National banks are encouraged byboth this final rule and section 1103(c) of the RFPA, 12 U.S.C. 3403(c),to notify all governmental authorities, federal, state and local, of possiblecriminal violations. Under the express language of 12 U.S.C. 3403(c):<ITAG tagnum="21">Nothing in this chapter shall preclude any financial institution,or any officer, employee, or agent of a financial institution, from notifyinga Government authority that such institution, or officer, employee, oragent has information which may be relevant to a possible violation ofany statute or regulation. Such information may include only the name orother identifying information concerning any individual or  account involvedin and the nature of any suspected illegal activity. Such information maybe disclosed notwithstanding any constitution, law, or regulation of anyState or political subdivision thereof to the contrary. Any financial institution,or officer, employee, or agent thereof, making a disclosure of informationpursuant to this subsection, shall not be liable to the customer underany law or regulation of the United States or any constitution, law, orregulation of any State or political subdivision thereof, for such disclosureor for any failure to notify the customer of such disclosure.</ITAG>The fact that the RFPA provides this ``safe harbor'' allows banks to turnover certain pertinent information to all relevant government agenciesincluding U.S. Customs. OCC does not require distribution to every agencythat may share an interest in obtaining information about suspected crimesat a bank (e.g. U.S. Customs, Small Business Administration, or the Departmentof Housing and Urban Development). Rather, OCC encourages banks, whereappropriate, to voluntarily disseminate information to additional local,state and federal agencies. To mandate further distributions in some situationswould be confusing and would impose an additional reporting burden on thebanks. Insofar as explicitly referencing RFPA on the forms is concerned, the OCCdoes not view that proposal as adding any legal weight to this mandatoryreporting requirement. OCC considers the role of bank counsel and bankmanagement to be one of providing guidelines to bank personnel concerningRFPA considerations and restrictions. The most recent amendments to the RFPA, (which are incorporated in theAnti-Drug Abuse Act, Pub. L. No. 100-690), provide additional authorityfor financial institutions making criminal referrals. In particular, referralspertaining to either crimes against financial institutions or Bank SecrecyAct violations that are committed by directors, officers, employees, orcontrolling shareholders of, or by major borrowers from, a financial institution,now explicitly fall within the ``good faith defense'' to the RFPA. Underthe latest amendments to the RFPA, 12 U.S.C. 3413(1) and 3417(c), financialinstitutions disclosing financial records pertaining to insider abuse,in good faith, are now provided a defense against all actions brought againstthe institution under the RFPA, the constitution of any State, or any otherState or local statute or regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Information on Potential Crimes </ITAG>One commenter sought additional information on the forms concerning thenature and scope of the underlying criminal violations upon which banksare obligated to prepare criminal referrals. The criminal referral formsalready provide summaries of those crimes banks are most likely to encounter.OCC believes those summaries offer enough of an outline for a bank employeeto evaluate a suspected crime. OCC encourages bank employees to discusssuspected criminal activities with bank counsel, or representatives ofthe FBI, the IRS, U.S. Attorney's Office, or local law enforcement, asappropriate. OCC believes additional explanations of the infinite permutationsof white collar criminal conduct are unnecessary. The more detailed thelist of crimes, the more likely it is that a crime omitted from that listwould be considered nonreportable. <ITAG tagnum="84">Submission of Criminal Referral Forms Threshold Amounts </ITAG>The final rule requires that a national bank submit a criminal referralform upon the discovery of any known or suspected criminal violation committedagainst the bank or involving a financial transaction involving bank personnel.A report must be filed where bank personnel are believed to be involvedregardless of the dollar amount of bank funds involved. The final rule also sets forth more general guidelines for the reportingof known or suspected criminal violations of the U.S. Code, or regulationspromulgated thereunder, where a violation is committed against the bankor where a criminal transaction is undertaken using the bank to facilitatethat transaction. The bank must report all criminal transactions involving$1,000 or more where it has a substantial basis for identifying a possiblesuspect or group of suspects. For a criminal violation not involving bank personnel and involving a transactionof $1,000 or less, a bank must file a criminal referral only when thattransaction appears to be part of a pattern of criminal activity committedby one or more identifiable individuals and the aggregate value of thetransactions totals $1,000 or more. For example, a series of forged signaturesappearing on credit card purchase receipts must be reported if the bankhas reason to believe one identifiable individual, or a group of identifiableindividuals acting in concert, has perpetrated the forgeries, and the aggregatedollar loss is $1,000 or more. For those situations (such as money launderingor false statements on credit applications) where the bank does not incura ``loss'', the $1,000 test applies in that the bank must evaluate whetherthe transaction either involved, or had the potential to involve, $1,000or more. In those situations where there is no substantial basis for the bank toidentify a possible suspect or group of suspects, a bank must report aknown or suspected criminal violation only when it involves $5,000 or more.For example, where a bank is unable to identify a suspect as the perpetratorof a check fraud, the bank need not file a referral until the loss on anygiven account exceeds $5,000. In addition, the final rule provides thata bank must report mysterious disappearances or unexplained shortages ofbank funds or other assets only when they amount to $5,000 or more. Where a bank suspects it has been used as a conduit for a violation ofthe money laundering statutes there will, of course, be no loss. As discussedabove, national banks are now required to report suspected violations ofthe money laundering and Bank Secrecy statutes where they have a reasonablebasis for believing a violation has occurred regardless of the dollar amountof the transaction. <ITAG tagnum="84">What Triggers the Reporting Requirement </ITAG>In order to clarify what constitutes a reportable ``known or suspectedcriminal violation,'' the OCC will continue to incorporate into its CriminalReferral Forms (CC-8010-08 and 8010-09) a listing and description of themost common federal crimes involving financial institutions, their personnel,or their customers, accounts. Using this list as a base, bank personnelshould, in most instances, be able to determine whether a particular situationgives rise to the reporting requirement. Of note, the revised CriminalReferral Forms which were issued concurrently with the interim regulationin March 1988, include reference to three additional federal criminal statutes:(1) 18 U.S.C. 1956; (2) 18 U.S.C. 1957; and (3) 31 U.S.C. 5324. Banks areencouraged to file referrals whenever they suspect criminal transactionsin violation of any of the cited statutes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Suspected Violations </ITAG>The reporting requirement imposes an obligation to report all ``known orsuspected criminal violations'' that meet specified criteria. By ``suspectedviolation'' the OCC is referring to a transaction or series of transactionsfor which there is a reasonable basis to believe that a criminal violationhas occurred. The OCC cannot quantify the precise amount of evidence neededto trigger the reporting requirement any more than it can delineate allthe relevant factors that a bank must consider in deciding whether or notto report a suspicious or otherwise irregular transaction. In many instances the suspicious nature of the transaction is a functionnot only of the transaction itself and its context but also of the bank'sexperience with the individuals associated with the transaction, eitheras employees or customers of the bank. In many situations, the bank willbe able to discern the ``intent'' of those involved in a suspicious transaction.Invariably, however, the pivotal question of criminal intent will be leftfor the determination of law enforcement authorities. In those situations,the bank should make a practical assessment of the suspicious transactionbased upon a good faith examination of all the relevant factors. Clearly,the more serious the irregularity, particularly if it involves a bank insider,the greater the obligation upon the bank to fully explore the matter. <ITAG tagnum="84">Revised Threshold Amounts For Filing Reports </ITAG>OCC has no desire to place unnecessary reporting burdens on national banks;however, it is interested in furthering crime detection and preventionin cooperation with other law enforcement agencies. OCC has determined,based upon its  experience with the criminal referrals made over the pastyear, that where a bank has no apparent basis for identifying a possiblesuspect or group of suspects involved with a known or suspected criminalviolation, a minimum reporting amount of $5,000 is appropriate. The commentersto the interim regulation universally endorsed the increase in this reportingthreshold.OCC has further determined, based upon its experience with past referralforms, that where the bank has a reasonable basis for identifying a possiblesuspect or group of suspects, it is important that every crime of $1,000or more be reported. In addition, crimes of less than $1,000 are to bereported where a bank has reason to believe that one or more identifiableindividuals has committed a series of crimes which, when aggregated, total$1,000 or more.Where a bank employee, officer, director, or shareholderis suspected of criminal activity, all bank related crimes must be reported,regardless of the dollar amount involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reporting Period</ITAG>The final rule continues to impose a 30-calendar day reporting period,commencing from the date of detection, during which a bank must file acriminal referral. In those situations where the transaction requires immediateattention or where the violation is ongoing, OCC strongly encourages thebank to notify the appropriate law enforcement agencies and the appropriateOCC Office by telephone. The bank's oral notification should be  followedby a timely written report. In those situations where a bank is not obligated to file a report, (e.g.an unexplained shortage of less than $5,000), but facts subsequently cometo light revealing information identifying the individual(s) known or suspectedof having committed or attempting to commit a criminal act, the 30-calendarday reporting period commences from the date that reportable information,such as the identity of a suspect, first. comes to light. <ITAG tagnum="84">Penalty for Failure to Report </ITAG>The final rule states when a civil money penalty may be assessed by OCCagainst a bank, its officers or its directors for failure to file a report.Penalties may be assessed where a violation is willful or demonstratesa careless disregard for compliance. Assessments are likely to be madewhere it is established that a bank officer, director or other employeeintentionally has attempted to cover up a defalcation, significant loss,pattern of criminal transactions, or has intentionally failed to file acriminal referral form. If a question exists as to whether to report an incident, OCC recommendsthat a criminal referral be submitted providing at least the nature ofthe transaction, relevant account numbers and the identities of those suspected.For example, where a bank has a substantial basis to suspect that an individualhas engaged in a pattern of criminal conduct, such as a series of transactionsthat appear to violate the money laundering statutes, the bank should filea criminal referral describing that pattern of criminal conduct. Additionally,banks are encouraged to report suspected violations, regardless of amount,to either state or local law enforcement authorities, whenever a violationof state or local law is suspected. <ITAG tagnum="84">Exceptions to Reporting Requirements </ITAG>The final rule in andSection; 21.11(f) continues to provide two exceptionsto the reporting requirements: one for robberies and burglaries and theother for lost or missing securities. These exceptions are provided becauseof the OCC's recordkeeping requirement in andSection; 21.5(c) which requiresa bank to keep a record of all crimes of violence on file, and becauseof the Securities and Exchange Commission's reporting requirements setforth at 17 CFR 240.17f-1 which requires the reporting of all lost andmissing securities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to section 605[b] of the Regulatory Flexibility Act [Pub. L. 96-354m,5 U.S.C. 601], the Comptroller of the Currency has certified that thisfinal rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small banks or other small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>The OCC has determined that this final rule is not a ``major rule'' andtherefore does not require a regulatory impact analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The collection of information requirements contained in this final rulehave been submitted to and approved by the Office of Management and Budgetunder section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act. OMB Control No. 1557-0069was assigned. The estimated average burden associated with the collectionsof information contained in this final rule is one-half hour per respondent.The burden per respondent may vary depending on individual circumstancesand on whether the long or short form must be filed. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestionsfor reducing this burden should be directed to: Legislative and RegulatoryAnalysis Division, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 490 L'EnfantPlaza East, SW., Washington, DC 20219 and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, Attention Treasury Desk Officer. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 21 </ITAG>National banks, Criminal referrals, Insider abuse, Theft, Embezzlement,Check kiting, Defalcations, Money laundering, Criminal transactions. <ITAG tagnum="84">Authority and Issuance </ITAG>For the reasons set out in the preamble, Part 21 of Chapter I of Title12 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 21_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
