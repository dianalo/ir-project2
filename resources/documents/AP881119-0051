He reiterated that if the ban takes effect on Jan 1 as scheduled,the United States will retaliate against EEC imports.   ``We should never consider the door closed,'' Yeutter said,``(but) I saw nothing in those talks yesterday that would indicatethat there was any hope of having the ban delayed.''   He and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng talked toreporters after discussing the proposed meat ban and othertrans-Atlantic trade issues Friday and today with officials at theEuropean Economic Community head office.   Yeutter also criticized proposed West German subsidies forDaimler-Benz AG to protect it from foreign exchange risks due to itsassumption of a stake in Airbus Industrie SA, the European aircraftconsortium.   ``We believe that sets a very unfortunate precedent. Companiesshould cover their own exchange rate risk,'' he said.   Daimler-Benz has approved a government proposal that it take a 30percent stake in Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH, astate-controlled aerospace company. In return, Bonn will give up to4.3 billion Deutsche marks ($2.4 billion) in subsidies to protectDaimler-Benz against foreign exchange risks resulting from MBB's37.9 percent stake in Airbus.   ``We are exceedingly displeased that exchange rate guarantees''were given, Yeutter said. ``If ... West Germany begins to provideexchange rate guarantees to its business firms, there will be greatpressure on its government and on other governments to providecorresponding exchange rate guarantees.''   The EEC Commission has yet to examine if the subsidies breach theEEC's antitrust rules.   On Jan. 1, the Common Market will ban imports of meat treatedwith growth-boosting hormones arguing the use of hormones causescancer. Yeutter and Lyng said there is no scientific evidence forthe ban on health grounds.   The ban has been delayed by a year to allow for a compromisesolution which has not emerged. If the ban remains, the UnitedStates will retaliate against the EEC. Yeutter said retaliationmight be reduced if the Common Market exempts from its ban importsof hormone-treated meat used as pet food.   ``If the EEC wishes to exempt pet food ... we would be pleasedwith that outcome. That would not resolve the fundamental issue butit would reduce the amount of retaliation.''   U.S. retaliation would affect $100 million dollars of EEC exportsto the United States of, among other items, meat, instant coffee,tomatoes, fruit juices and low-alcohol beverages.   That matches the value of meat the EEC imports from the UnitedStates annually. If pet food were exempted, retaliation could be cutto $85 million worth of Common Market exports, Yeutter said. The EECban was imposed under pressure from consumer groups and the EuropeanParliament.</TEXT></DOC>
