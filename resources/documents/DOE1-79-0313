A logarithmic increase of magneticresistivity is observed with the decrease of temperature in the higher-temperatureregion. This is one of the characteristic features of dense Kondo system.This compound has a large value of the low-temperature magnetic susceptibilityand, characteristic of heavy fermion compounds, an enormous coefficientof the electronic specific heat, {gamma} {similar_to} 800 mJ/mol K{sup2}. AC magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that this compoundneither orders magnetically nor is superconducting above 70 mK. To understandthe nature and mechanism of the heavy-fermion compound CePtSi, a numberof isostructural pseudoternary systems are investigated by studying thevariations of lattice parameters, static magnetic susceptibility, andmagnetic contribution to the resistivity. The magnetic properties ofnarrow-band metals ranging from heavy fermions to spin-fluctuation compoundsto mixed-valence materials are displayed in the series Ce(Pt/sub 1-x/Ni/subx/) Si. Lastly, the semi-heavy-fermion system CeSi/sub x/ (1.60 {le}x {le} 1.90) is examined.</TEXT></DOC>
