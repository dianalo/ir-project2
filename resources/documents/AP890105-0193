Negotiations for the release of Brig. Gen. Eduardo Batalla,regional Philippine Constabulary commander, and Col. Romeo Abendancontinued until dawn Friday.   There was no official word to indicate when the hostages might bereleased. Heavily armed troops surrounded the headquarters buildingwhere the hostages were being held.   Conflicting reports said one and possibly two people were killedwhen the Moslem police attacked about noon Thursday in Batalla'soffice at a seaside military compound in this city, 560 miles southof Manila.   In Manila, the radio station DZRH said the estimated 15 policemenand their supporters, led by Patrolman Rizal Alih, accepted an offerby Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of Representatives, to be flownto Palawan island, 350 miles west of here. The report could not beconfirmed.   Alih was ordered to surrender to Batalla as part of aninvestigation into the 1984 killings of seven people, including fourmarines and an army nurse, during a siege of his home here, said Lt.Col. Jovencio Gongora, city police commander.   That incident followed an attempt to arrest Alih in the November1984 slaying of Zamboanga City Mayor Cesar Climaco. Alih wasacquitted in the Climaco killing but faced other murder charges,officials said.   When Alih entered Batalla's office, he drew his weapon andshooting broke out, said Lt. Col. Anthony Elias, spokesman for themilitary's Southern Command. Several other officers managed to flee,but Batalla and Abendan, the chief of staff, were taken prisoner, hesaid.   Four Filipino reporters also were in the office at the time ofthe shooting but were later released, Elias said.   Officials said Alih's brother-in-law was killed and his wifeseriously wounded. Others said the wife later died.   Sen. Santanina Rasul, a relative of Alih and one of thenegotiators, said the gunmen demanded to be flown out of the camp toan undisclosed location along with their hostages.   Alih threatened to burn Zamboanga, the major city of westernMindanao, if his demand was not met, she said, adding that he alsodemanded that all charges against him be dropped.   Mrs. Rasul, one of two Moslems in the 23-member Senate, saidMitra offered a plane to fly the gunmen to his home island ofPalawan.</TEXT></DOC>
