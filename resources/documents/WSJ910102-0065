Bankers and analysts generally think all the major bankswill quickly move to the lower rate. They said by waitinguntil the first week of the new year, the banks will be ableto use the older, higher prime rate to reset some businessand consumer loans tied to the prime. In effect, the delaymight boost first-quarter profits.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I think it {the 9.5% prime rate} will be inevitable,&quot;said Donald Crowley, an analyst for the firm of Keefe,Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc. Postponing the cut this long &quot;has afair amount of pricing impact&quot; on the first quarter, he said.   About a month ago, the Federal Reserve Board beganlowering key rates that determine some bank deposit costs, inan attempt to stimulate lending and ameliorate recession. Asa result, First National Bank of Chicago, the main unit ofFirst Chicago Corp., and a handful of smaller banks cut theirprime rate. But the country's largest banks delayed loweringtheir prime rate to customers.   The profits of many of the big banks have been battered bynonperforming real estate loans, continuing problems withweak foreign loans and other woes.   BankAmerica, the nation's second-biggest bank with $109billion of assets at the end of the third quarter, is one ofthe healthier banks, generating robust earnings through itsretail branch networks in California and Washington state.Mr. Crowley said it may have made the first move among theTop 10 because of its strong earnings, and because RichardRosenberg, its chief executive officer, is an astutemarketing man who &quot;probably saw public-relations advantagesin moving at this time.&quot;   A BankAmerica spokesman declined to comment on the timingof the cut in what the bank calls its &quot;reference rate,&quot; otherthan to say &quot;it seemed the right business decision for us.&quot;   The prime rate remained stuck at 10% for almost all of1990. Banks moved to that level last Jan. 8, from 10.5%.   Many economists doubt that the lower rate will have muchimmediate impact on lending activity. They believe that theeconomy is now mired in recession because fundamentalbusiness and consumer demand has sagged, partly from acollapse in confidence. The inflation-adjusted price ofcredit in 1990 was generally below the level of precedingyears, but that trend didn't forestall a slump that looksincreasingly severe.</TEXT></DOC>
