That may sound like heresy to investors in money-marketmutual funds. Typically, they go for the highest yields.   But the fact is that there are a lot of other things toconsider when choosing a money fund.   Safety for one. Although nobody has ever suffered a lossin a money fund, there have been a couple of close calls.&quot;The biggest issue is risk,&quot; says John Markese, director ofresearch for the American Association of IndividualInvestors, a Chicago educational organization. &quot;Mostquestions (from investors) used to be about yield, nowthey're about safety.&quot;   Other things -- from the size of the fund, to itsgeographic location, to the services it provides and the feesit does or doesn't charge -- are also important for investorspouring tens of billions of dollars a year into money funds.   Here's a look at the key factors:                                                                                                          SAFETY. Money funds are among the safest investments,although they don't carry federal deposit insurance like bankaccounts. They are structured so that the value of aninvestor's shares remains at $1 each, and only the yieldchanges to reflect the return on the investments in fundportfolios. Money funds are also highly liquid; in most casesan investor can withdraw money simply by writing a check.   For the most part, differences in safety are slight. TheSecurities and Exchange Commission limits money funds'investments to highly rated securities. But there aregradations.   Some funds limit themselves to the very highest ratings ofStandard andamp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service Inc.Others accept the second-highest rating. Some funds investonly in Treasury securities, or Treasury andgovernment-agency securities. Others are putting much oftheir cash into commercial paper, which is unsecuredshort-term corporate IOUs, and dollar-denominatedcertificates of deposit sold overseas.   About half the assets of taxable money funds are currentlyinvested in commercial paper. That's up from 44% at the startof 1989 and 29% at the start of 1984. Thus the quality ofthat commercial paper is a question for money-fund investors,especially if the economy turns down.   Just last month, when the commercial paper of Mortgage andamp;Realty Trust was downgraded by Standard andamp; Poor's, the parentcompanies of several money funds bought Mortgage andamp; Realtypaper from their funds to protect them from possible losses.Last year, when Integrated Resources Inc. defaulted on nearly$1 billion of commercial paper, the parents of Value LineCash Fund and Liquid Green Trust absorbed the losses.   &quot;Look at a fund's standards for buying commercial paper,&quot;says Kurt Brouwer, an investment adviser with the SanFrancisco firm Brouwer andamp; Janachowski. &quot;You should be willingto give up a quarter or a half point (of yield) to make sureyou're safeguarding&quot; your investment.   The safest funds usually are those that invest exclusivelyin Treasury and government-agency securities, which arebacked by the U.S. government.                                                                                                          YIELD. On average, money-fund yields are higher than thoseon many comparable investments, such as bank money-marketaccounts and short-term certificates of deposit. The latestaverage seven-day compound yield is 7.99%. Compound yieldsassume reinvestment of dividends.   But yields on the more than 400 taxable funds vary widely.Yields on individual funds range from 6.54% to 8.85%. Thedifference is equal to $231 a year on a $10,000 investment.   &quot;You can earn one-third more by picking the right fund,&quot;says William E. Donoghue, publisher of IBC/Donoghue's MoneyFund Report, a Holliston, Mass., newsletter.   Yields on funds that limit their investments to governmentsecurities are usually slightly lower than on other funds.According to Donoghue's, the average seven-day compound yieldof Treasury-only funds is currently 7.70%.                                                                                                          AVERAGE MATURITY. Longer maturities enable a fund toretain higher yields when interest rates are falling, just asshorter maturities permit it to latch onto higher-yieldingsecurities sooner when rates are rising. The average for thetaxable funds tracked by Donoghue's currently is a fairlylong 45 days.   Some financial advisers recommend choosing a fund that'sclose to the average for all taxable funds. &quot;I wouldn't wanta fund with a real long average maturity . . . beyond 50 or60 days,&quot; says Mr. Donoghue of Money Fund Report.   The problem with the longer maturities is that they makeit difficult for fund managers to take advantage of quickincreases in interest rates. As a result, yields can lagthose of funds with shorter average maturities when rates arerising.   In an extreme case, average maturity could also become asafety issue. If shareholders decided to bail out, themanager could be forced to dump securities at fire-saleprices, thereby lowering the net asset value of the fund.   Currently, one of the funds with the longest averagematurities is Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar, at 83 days. JosephDiMartino, president of Dreyfus Corp. and manager of thefund, says the long average maturity isn't a problem. Thereare securities maturing every day that could be used to meetredemptions, he says.                                                                                                          FUND EXPENSES. These are the charges a fund deducts fromthe return on its investments to meet various costs ofrunning the fund. What's left is the yield that's passedalong to investors.   The current average is about 0.75% of assets, but somefunds, like Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar, temporarily are waivingfees. Others, like R. Meeder andamp; Associates Inc., which managesFlex-Fund, waive a portion of the fees as a matter of policyto keep the fund among the highest yielding.   Dreyfus now says it will waive fees on Worldwide Dollar atleast until June 15, or when assets reach $7.5 billion.Fidelity Spartan currently is charging investors just 0.10%of assets and has guaranteed that the so-called expense ratiowon't top 0.45% at least until March 1991.   &quot;If it's not too inconvenient, you should take advantageof&quot; the fee waivers, says Sheldon Jacobs, editor of No-LoadFund Investor, a newsletter based in Hastingson-Hudson, N.Y.&quot;It's like buying things on sale.&quot;                                                                                                          SERVICES. Most funds offer free check writing, butFidelity Spartan, which is among the highest yielding,charges $2 a check. Check minimums also differ. The minimumis $1,000 at Fidelity Spartan and just $100 at Flex-Fund.Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s Cash Management Account, the largestmoney fund, doesn't charge a per-check fee but carries an$80-a-year account fee.   Active investors might want to choose a fund that's partof a large family of funds that permits switching betweenfunds by telephone, so they can move their money aroundeasily.                                                                                                          SIZE. Larger funds may have lower expense ratios, becausefixed costs are spread over a broader base, and may be betterable to absorb losses in case of a default.   Some people even consider a fund's location in theirdecision because they don't want their deposits spending timein the U.S. mail instead of earning interest. Some fundspermit wire transfers from your bank.   &quot;Look at what you want from a money fund,&quot; advises Mr.Donoghue. &quot;If you want to use it as a checking account, lookfor low check minimums and no check-writing fees. If you'relooking for a supersavings account, you want the highestyield. For super-safety, take a government fund. A smallsaver wants a low minimum deposit. You're buying this thingfor the services.&quot;   ---             How Some Money Funds Compare                                                                                                          Fund: Merill Lynch CMA   Assets (in millions): $30,022.8   Yield*: 8.15%   Minimum initial investment: $20,000   Expense Ratio: 0.56%   Average maturity (days): 55   Pct.
