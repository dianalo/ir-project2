 With it Apple overcame whathad been perhaps the biggest obstacle to the Mac's acceptance in thecorporate market: the difficulty of connecting hard disks to the originalMacs.andP;  Today, however, clouds are gathering on the Apple SCSI horizon:andM;andgt;Users and network managers continue to complain about termination-relatedproblems: Although the rules are clear on paper, in reality setting up astable SCSI chain often turns out to be a black art, especially with Apple'snewest machines.andM;andgt;Apple's SCSI DMA (direct memory access) chip, a custom circuit that thecompany said in March would &quot;support direct memory transfers on the MacIIfx,&quot; turns out not to do any such thing with System 6.0.5.andP;  Sources said itprobably won't work as advertised with System 7.0 either, leaving only A/UXusers to benefit in the foreseeable future.andM;andgt;An increasing number of storage vendors and users say that the data-transferrate of Apple's SCSI -- about 1.5 Mbytes per second -- leaves the Mac unableto take advantage of the full capabilities of high-speed disks and tapedrives now appearing on the market, boast transfer rates of 2, 3 or 4 Mbytesper second.andM;Some Apple engineers privately dismiss these complaints as misguided attemptsto create a market for products that will deliver only imperceptiblebenefits.andP;  Raw data transfer rates are only a small part of I/O performance,and now and for years to come, they say, the Mac will actually wait for driveperformance to catch up, rather than vice versa.andM;But several well-known Mac vendors are betting that they can now convincecustomers that bypassing Apple's SCSI port is worth a significant investment.andO;At last month's Macworld Expo here, at least four companies -- DayStarDigital Inc., Golden Triangle Computers Inc., Jets Cybernetics and MicroNetTechnology Inc. -- showed NuBus cards with their own supplementary SCSI ports(see stories, Page 6, and MacWEEK, April 17).andM;Although the technologies used differ, all have in common the assumption thatApple's SCSI is no longer state of the art.andP;  In a sense, in fact, it neverwas, because it never provided support for some of the capabilitiesenumerated in the original SCSI specification, including synchronoustransfers.andM;Some critics have long blamed Apple for this &quot;non-standard&quot; implementation.andO;But experts say that Apple doesn't deserve all the blame.andP;  In a newsletterpublished last summer, the X3T9.2 committee, the standards-setting group thatdeveloped the SCSI spec, acknowledged that the original standard &quot;permittedan almost unlimited choice of options, features and selections in theimplementation of a SCSI host adapter or controller,&quot; creating &quot;a highprobability&quot; that one vendor's version would not work with another's.andM;That problem should disappear with the ratification of SCSI-2, an enhancedversion of the spec, which is now in the process of ratification.andP;  After a45-day mail ballot of participating companies, a draft is expected to gobefore the American National Standards Institute for final approval thissummer.andM;The draft provides a long list of new high-performance features:andM;andgt;Wide SCSI, which adds provisions for 16- and 32-bit-wide data transfers.andM;andgt;Fast SCSI, a mode that doubles transfer speeds (up to 40 Mbytes per secondwhen used with 32-bit Wide SCSI).andM;andgt;Tagged Command Queuing, a procedure that allows a host to send a peripherala batch of commands and then return to other chores.andM;andgt;Definitions for types of devices not previously included.andM;Perhaps the greatest potential benefit of the new standard, though, stemsfrom its increased detail and precision: The draft is more than 600 pageslong, compared with about 200 for the original.andP;  Assuming developers followthe letter and spirit of SCSI-2, the &quot;plug-and-play&quot; promise of the standardmay at last become a reality.andM;That will depend on the development of chip sets that embody the fullstandard and then on their adoption by Apple and other system and peripheralsmanufacturers.andP;  That process could take several years.andP;  Al-though Appleparticipated in the drafting of SCSI-2, it has not an-nounced concrete plansto adopt it.andM;Some companies, however, are already moving ahead with SCSI-2 products, andJets is working to establish a consortium it calls the SisterShip program forSCSI-2 hardware vendors, OEMs and value-added resellers.andP;  Although theproject is still in its early stages, Joseph Edozien, chairman of the PaloAlto, Calif.-based company, predicted last week, &quot;In 18 to 24 months, SCSI-2will be a real standard for the upper half of the market.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
