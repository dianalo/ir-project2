Testifying before a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee yesterday, Mr. Meese defended his personal financial arrangements, provided fresh details about his dealings with scandal-plagued Wedtech over the years and asserted that he &quot;endeavored to make full disclosure&quot; of all his private investments.    Under persistent questioning before the same panel, David Martin, director of the federal Office of Government Ethics, said a review of Mr. Meese's specific investments and partnership documents convinced him that the attorney general failed to meet legal obligations to disclose his interests.    However, while Mr. Martin told lawmakers Mr. Meese still hasn't fully complied with reporting requirements, he later suggested to reporters that the criticism of the attorney general was &quot;blown out of proportion&quot; and that Mr. Meese made &quot;a good faith&quot; effort to comply.    Mr. Martin, a Reagan administration appointee, has emphasized in the past that his primary goal is to advise and help bring federal officials into voluntary compliance with ethics laws and regulations. By contrast, James McKay, the independent counsel currently investigating Mr. Meese's dealings with Mr. Chinn and Wedtech, must determine whether any criminal laws were broken.    Earlier this week, Mr. Meese did disclose details of a $60,000 partnership set up by his adviser, San Francisco investment counselor W. Franklyn Chinn. Mr. Chinn served as a consultant to Wedtech and was on its board until he was forced out earlier this year. Wedtech is currently the target of a Justice Department criminal investigation.    The session, punctuated by sharp, partisan exchanges, indicates that critics in Congress and elsewhere are stepping up their attacks on the attorney general. Mr. Meese faces two separate independent counsel investigations on potential criminal violations related to Wedtech and to the Iran-Contra affair. Yesterday was his first public testimony responding to recent questions about his financial disclosures.    In one sharp exchange, Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.), chairman of the subcommittee, told the attorney general: &quot;You're the No. 1 lawyer in our country. You're supposed to be familiar with the law.&quot;    Afterward, Mr. Meese told reporters the criticism was &quot;a partisan, political attack&quot; based on &quot;distorted characterizations&quot; of federal ethics laws.    During the hearing, Mr. Meese told lawmakers that he recalled receiving as many as 12 memos about Wedtech from his longtime friend and associate E. Robert Wallach in 1981 and 1982. Some of the memos, which were sent to Mr. Meese's home as well as his White House office, specifically sought help for the company, according to the attorney general. He was then counselor to the president.    Mr. Meese said he urged his aides to &quot;take whatever appropriate action&quot; was necessary to make sure the Bronx, N.Y.-based minority contractor received a &quot;fair hearing&quot; in competing for Pentagon contracts. But as he has done in the past, Mr. Meese asserted that he never improperly interceded on behalf of the company and didn't invest in or receive any other benefits from Wedtech.    Sometime in the spring of 1985, Mr. Meese told lawmakers, he was introduced to Mr. Chinn by Mr. Wallach, who described the investment adviser as someone who also was involved with Wedtech. According to Mr. Meese, he was simply told that Mr. Chinn &quot;had been asked to help&quot; the company. &quot;I really didn't pay much attention to what he was&quot; or what precise connections he had with Wedtech, Mr. Meese testified.    The attorney general said he couldn't recall whether he first learned about Mr. Chinn's connections with Wedtech before or after May 23, 1985, when he invested about $60,000 in a &quot;limited blind partnership&quot; set up by Mr. Chinn's own company, Financial Management International Inc.    The attorney general said he didn't seek to learn details about the affiliation between Mr. Chinn and Wedtech, even after the Justice Department began its criminal investigation of the contractor and its management last year. Wedtech has since filed for bankruptcy-law protection and has new management.    It wasn't until three months ago, according to Mr. Meese's testimony, that he learned that &quot;persons with whom I am or was acquainted&quot; were possible subjects of the government's expanding Wedtech investigation. At that point, he told lawmakers, he decided immediately to remove himself from all decisions involving those criminal probes.    But Sen. Levin and other critics contend that step should have been taken months earlier. In early May, Mr. Meese formally moved to terminate the Chinn partnership but still didn't disclose the partnership's holdings.    Mr. Martin, the government's top ethics watchdog, told the subcommittee that July 2 was the first time the Justice Department contacted him for guidance on any of the legal issues involving disclosure of the partnership's assets. Mr. Martin testified that he told Associate Attorney General Stephen Trott &quot;in the strongest words that I know . . . that there should be a disclosure.&quot;    Four days later, Mr. Meese's lawyers publicly released the information but asserted that it was Mr. Martin and his staff, rather than the attorney general, who violated federal ethics laws by failing to provide warnings that previous disclosure forms filed by Mr. Meese were inadequate.    In his response to lawmakers, Mr. Martin acknowledged that his office was at fault for failing initially to spot the issue and raise &quot;a red flag&quot; about the way the partnership was reported. But the ethics official said that if Mr. Meese had used the correct name of the investment vehicle, that probably would have &quot;triggered an automatic inquiry&quot; by his staff. That name -- &quot;Meese Partners&quot; -- would have signaled Mr. Meese's active involvement, while Financial Management International did not, Mr. Martin suggested. </TEXT></DOC>
