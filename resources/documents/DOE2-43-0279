Earlier works in this areaeither dealt with a very simple program structure or resulted in methodswith exponential complexity. An efficient procedure is developed to computethe performance measures for series-parallel-reducible task systems usingqueueing network models. The procedure is based on the concept of hierarchicaldecomposition and a new operational approach. Numerical results for threetest cases are presented and compared to those of simulations.</TEXT></DOC>
