In the year-earlier quarter, the maker of chemical coatings, paints and household products had profit of $2.8 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $112.8 million. However, in that quarter the company had a loss of $695,000 from continuing operations; profit of $3.5 million from discontinued operations brought the quarter into the black.    By contrast, Mr. Banks said, the latest quarter, ended June 30, represented the first time in eight quarters that Grow had a quarterly profit from continuing operations. He said he believes this performance, though still not up to the company's goals, could mark the beginning of a turnaround.    Mr. Banks said Grow expects to post an operating profit in fiscal 1990. And, he said, net will be boosted by a gain of about $10 million in the fiscal 1990 first quarter on the $25 million sale of the company's U.S. Paint division to Nippon Oil andamp; Fats Ltd., of Tokyo. The sale was completed Tuesday.    &quot;I think we're coming out of&quot; fiscal 1989 &quot;much stronger as a result of the Nippon sale,&quot; Mr. Banks said.    For all of fiscal 1989, Grow will report a loss of about $2.9 million on revenue of about $410 million, he said.    In the previous year, the company earned $35,000 on revenue of $383.3 million. That year included a loss from continuing operations of $6.8 million and profit from discontinued operations of $6.3 million. It also included a gain of $568,000 from an accounting change.    Grow plans to announce its fourth-quarter and full-year results next week.    In addition to losses over the past year, Grow has been buffeted by, first, the disclosure that an investor group that might seek control of the company had acquired a stake in it; and then by a fire at a chemicals warehouse, which has led to a criminal complaint against the company. Following these two setbacks was the collapse of a friendly deal whereby Grow was to be sold to PPG Industries Inc., of Pittsburgh. Grow hasn't paid a quarterly dividend since the fiscal 1988 third quarter.    Once, Mr. Banks reflected, &quot;I felt that I was a .400 hitter. Then over the past two years, I felt I was in a slump, hitting .100.&quot;    But, he said, the latest quarter provided signs of strength in certain businesses, especially in marine and heavy-maintenance coatings. Although he didn't provide figures, he said this segment saw a &quot;strong upsurge&quot; in sales, and that profit was &quot;considerably ahead&quot; of the year earlier. He attributed the gains partly to new construction of tankers and freighters outside the U.S., adding that Grow is beginning to penetrate markets in the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.    But those gains were offset by difficulties in the automotive business, where the quarter's profit was &quot;substantially less&quot; than a year ago, he said. He said research and development spending has produced new Grow sealants now in use at a General Motors Corp. plant, but the auto maker hasn't yet begun to use the sealants at additional plants. He added that Grow, which also provides thinners and adhesives to the auto industry, has found it difficult to pass on higher materials costs to customers.    For all of fiscal 1989, Banks said, Grow's coatings and chemicals unit, which includes the marine and automotive businesses, had pretax operating profit about the same as the $18.5 million of fiscal 1988.    In the company's other main unit, consumer and professional products, the operating loss for the latest year was about $3 million, versus an operating loss of $4.6 million a year earlier, he said. The loss in the latest quarter also was &quot;substantially less&quot; than a year ago, he said. The unit sells swimming-pool chemicals and household cleaning products, among other things.    In July 1988, Grow became the subject of some takeover speculation when a group including Edward S. Buchanan, a Massachusetts banker, bought a 6.7% stake in the company and later raised its stake to 7.7%, stating that it was considering a tender offer. The group hasn't made a bid, though, and Mr. Banks said, &quot;We have not had what I would call friendly talks.&quot;    He said he never did get an explanation from PPG as to why last September it canceled its agreement to acquire Grow for $233 million and assume about $67 million of Grow's debt. But despite PPG's statements to the contrary, he said, he believes the deal was hurt by a chemical fire at a Grow warehouse in the Los Angeles area, which forced the evacuation of nearby residents. Recalling the heavy publicity surrounding the fire, he said, &quot;I knew that was the end of the deal.&quot; PPG's cancellation came within days of the fire.    The district attorney's office of Los Angeles County has since issued a criminal complaint against Grow, alleging violations of the state health and safety code. The company denies the charges.    Mr. Banks said Grow hopes to restore dividend payments &quot;as soon as we have the necessary profits.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
