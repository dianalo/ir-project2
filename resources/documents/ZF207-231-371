 The reason for Ethernet'slongevity is simple: the scheme provides high-speed transmission at aneconomical price, offering a broad base of support for a variety of LAN andmicro-to-mainframe applications.andP;  After being on the market for nearly 9years, it boasts a large installed base and is still a wise network choice.andM;These days you can buy an adapter card to plug your PC into an Ethernet-plannetwork for as low as $295; 13 adapter cards designed to work with coax-cableEthernet networks are reviewed here.andP;  Since most of them are made from thesame chip set, you'll find them quite similar.andP;  Some of them, however, arebetter for plugging into a server than into a PC workstation.andP;  And there areother important differences when it comes to features, performance, and cost.andM;DEFINITIVE ETHERNETandM;People often associate the term Ethernet with network elements beyond thescope encompassed by the cabling and signaling scheme coinvented by RobertMetcalfe and David Boggs at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).andO;According to Metcalfe, the source of the Ethernet name is &quot;the luminiferousether thought to pervade all of space for the propagation of light&quot; (a.k.a.andO;electromagnetic waves).andM;In clearer terms, Ethernet is a specification that describes a method forcomputers and data systems to connect and to share cabling.andP;  Ethernetencompasses what are called the Physical and Data Link layers of datacommunications by the International Standards Organization, thestandard-setting body for data communications.andP;  (For background information,see &quot;Networking Acronyms and Buzzwords,&quot; PC Magazine, June 14, 1988.)andM;The primary characteristics of the Physical Ethernet Link include a data rateof 10 megabits per second, a maximum station separation of 2.8 kilometers, ashielded coaxial cable connecting the stations, and a specific kind ofelectrical signaling on the cable called Manchester-encoded digital baseband.andO;The latter specification describes the electrical signals that make up thedigital zeros and ones that are constantly passing over the network.andM;The major part of the Data Link layer specification for Ethernet describesthe way stations share access to coaxial cable through a process calledCarrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD).andP;  CSMA/CD isan operational scheme that modern standards committees call a media accesscontrol (MAC) protocol.andP;  The media is the coaxial cable connecting thenetwork nodes, and the access control protocol determines how nodes on thenetwork share access to the cable.andM;ETHERNET THE PERENNIALandM;For many years Ethernet was the fastest-growing network system and the firstchoice of many data managers and system integrators.andP;  But many people nowbuying networks choose IBM's Token-Ring cabling and media-sharing planinstead.andP;  Token-Ring performs well, and IBM continually dangles new ways toconnect PC and mainframe computers through Token-Ring as bait to prospectivebuyers.andM;Token-Ring installations, however, are very expensive compared with those ofEthernet, and there are efficient ways to connect to IBM, DEC,Hewlett-Packard, Xerox, and many other computer systems over Ethernet.andP;  (Fora longer discussion of the differences between Ethernet and IBM's Token-Ring,see &quot;Making Connections: 3Com's Ethernet and Token-Ring,&quot; PC Magazine, April14, 1987.)andM;As befitting a network scheme with its tenure, Ethernet has had manyoffspring.andP;  ATandamp;T's StarLAN is an 1Mb-per-second adaptation of Ethernet totwisted-pair telephone wire.andP;  Ethernet adapters using fiber optic cable areavailable from Codenoll Technologies and DCA 10Net Communications.andP;  Thelatest growth area is in Ethernet adapters operating over twisted-pairtelephone wire at data rates of 10Mb per second.andP;  In this review, however, weconfine ourselves to network adapter cards devised for installations usingthe older Ethernet cabling schemes for coaxial cable.andM;The coax-cabling scheme found most often in installations of PC-basednetworks uses a thin, 52-ohm coaxial cable between each network station.andO;This cable, commonly called thin Ethernet, is typically limited to 305 meters(1,000 feet) between repeaters, although an Institute of Electrical andElectronic Engineers (IEEE) specification limits it to 600 feet.andP;  The networkinterface cards in each station usually attach to this cable through aT-connector, which makes it easy to connect and disconnect stations from thenetwork without breaking the continuity of the cable.andM;More frequently found in installations with larger computers is the oldestEthernet cabling scheme.andP;  This scheme uses heavily shielded coaxial cable(informally named &quot;frozen yellow garden hose,&quot; which aptly describes itssize, color, and ease of installation) that serves as a backbone among theclusters of nodes scattered around a building.andP;  The maximum length of thiscable between repeaters is 500 meters (1,640 feet), and the cable attaches todevices called transceivers, which transform the cable's connections intosomething more suitable for a PC or terminal.andP;  A flexible transceiver cablemade up of a shielded twisted-pair wire runs between the transceiver and thenetwork node.andP;  Transceiver cables can be up to 15 meters (45 feet) long; theyconnect to the network card through a 15-pin D-connector.andM;HOW FAST DOES IT GO?andM;The fact that Ethernet's 10-megabit-per-second data rate specification ismuch faster than IBM's Token-Ring specification (4Mb per second) and ARCnet's(2Mb per second) can be misleading because these speeds describe thetransmission rate over the cable.andP;  What these ratings fail to reflect are thefactors that limit effective throughput on a PC-based LAN--things like thedata transfer rate of a hard disk drive, the transfer rate of the computer'sdata bus, and the efficiency of the networking software.andM;For this reason, we've found it difficult ever to get five to seven fast PCsto generate more than a megabyte per second of network data combined in thePC LAN Labs benchmark tests, even under the most artificial conditions.andP;  Thefact is, the networks themselves sit idle most of the time while the harddisk, the operating system software, the server software, and the computerdata bus handle the data coming and going.andP;  Ethernet was designed to handle&quot;bursty&quot; traffic, and that is exactly what it gets in real-world PC-basedLANs.andM;More on the tests: in order to share access to the coax Ethernet cableeffectively, Ethernet adapter cards must follow the aforementioned CSMA/CDprotocol (see the sidebar &quot;Packaging and Moving Data: the Ethernet Way&quot; for adescription of how the protocol works).andP;  The &quot;back-off&quot; algorithm generatedby CSMA/CD in the event of packet collisions can have an effect on benchmarktests because if a node is involved in a packet collision, it will defer toother nodes until there are no more collisions within a given time period.andM;What this means is that any node might &quot;sit out&quot; several collision resolutioncycles.andP;  For this reason, if the benchmark test period is too short, theperformance of an adapter that sends out packets that are involved incollisions will look bad.andP;  Our benchmark test charts thus show the averagedresults of repeated runs.andM;CARD CHIP SETSandM;All Ethernet cards on the market are designed using chip sets containing thebasics of the Ethernet protocols.andP;  At present, the majority of the cards usethe set created by National Semiconductor Corp., although some use Intel's.andO;(Western Digital has announced that it will market an Ethernet chip set earlyin 1989, a move which should further reduce the already declining price ofthe network interface cards.)andM;The Ethernet adapter cards available from different manufacturers differ inthe way they use the semiconductor manufacturer's chip set and in thefeatures the designers add.andP;  Companies design different implementations toimprove performance and incorporate value-added features.andP;  Because of thesimilarity among the products of many vendors, we primarily looked foranything that a company does to differentiate its cards from those of thecompetition; the reviews, therefore, are short.andM;These interface cards typically contain 8K of RAM that buffers the networkdata.andP;  Some vendors, like Gateway Communications, put 16K or more of RAM onthe cards to improve the handling of data and prevent dropped packets.andO;Similarly, some companies put a 16-bit-wide data path on the card to improveflow between the card and the computer data bus.andP;  RAM added to network cardscan also store portions of program code, thereby freeing working RAM in thecomputer.andM;The addition of a microprocessor from the 80186 family to the networkinterface card reduces the amount of work the processor in the host computermust do to implement network communications.andP;  These cards are typically usedin servers that carry a heavy data load because they're expensive and can dothe greatest good in the server.andM;One option that's become almost a standard feature among card manufacturersis an open socket for a remote boot ROM.andP;  This special ROM forces the hoststation to take its operating system boot from the server and is useful insome types of LAN installations, such as those with diskless workstations.andO;Other usability features include LEDs that indicate operational status, DIPswitches that make it easy to change the card configuration, and differentkinds of connectors.andM;DRIVING THE CARDSandM;On the cable side of the network, these adapter cards are interchangeable.andO;Adapters from 3Com will happily exchange packets over a shared cable with anadapter from Eath or any of the other vendors.andP;  They all conform to the sameelectrical signaling, physical connection, and media-access specifications.andM;But things are very different on the software side of the card.andP;  Each vendordesigned and implemented the adapter using slightly different hardwarecomponents.andP;  Those components require customized software in order to addressthem and to move data through the system; this level of software is typicallyknown as the driver software.andP;  The performance of the software thatinterfaces the cards with the NetWare network operating system can also makea difference.andM;We intended to test these cards under both Novell's NetWare and under IBM'sPC LAN software.andP;  We quickly discovered, however, that while almost everyvendor chose to develop drivers for Novell's NetWare, few companies havedeveloped the custom implementations of NetBIOS required to run PC LAN.andM;There are several reasons for this, and they have as much to do with theimpending release of Microsoft's LAN Manager as they do with the highpopularity of NetWare.andP;  Under LAN Manager, Microsoft will furnish almost allof the code that companies need to develop NetBIOS drivers for their cards.andO;Hardware designers will write only a small (perhaps 2K bytes) block of codefor final interfacing.andP;  In short, many companies are simply waiting for LANManager before they furnish NetBIOS drivers for their cards.andM;Since NetWare drivers are popular and plentiful, we tested the cards onlyunder NetWare.andP;  But keep in mind that our performance tests are therefore asmuch a test of the NetWare driver software supplied by the vendor as they areof the hardware on the cards.andP;  The quality of the code in the driver can havea significant impact on the throughput of the card.andM;The 13 adapter cards for coaxial Ethernet networks that we've reviewed comefrom 12 vendors: Acer Technologies Corp., AST Research, Datatech Enterprises(DTK), Earth Computer Technologies, Gateway Communications, IMC NetworksCorp., Localnet Communications, Novell, 3Com Corp., Tiara Computer Systems,Univation, and Western Digital.andP;  Excelan also markets a network adapter card,but it arrived too late for this review.andP;  Some cards emulate Novell's ownEthernet cards, and we were able to use these cards under the same driverwithout regenerating the system.andP;  Other cards have unique drives and forcedus to regenerate the operating system to link in the new drivers.andM;You can mix ethernet cards from different vendors in any network you installand operate.andP;  You can put a card augmented with a microprocessor and using a16-bit-wide data path in the server for high efficiency and mix lower-costcards from different vendors throughout the workstations.andP;  But you mustgenerate the appropriate driver for each type of card and install it in thenode using that card.andP;  Mixing drivers between nodes is a potentialadministrative headache, but if you configure the different adapterscarefully, this setup can save you money and let you easily expand yournetwork.andM;A GLOSSARY OF ETHERNET TERMSandM;AddressandM;A unique memory location.andP;

 The CSMA/CD media access technique makes sure that twodatagrams aren't sent out at the same time and serves as a method ofarbitration if they are.andM;Ethernet's datagram concept makes a simple claim: that a communicating nodewill make its best effort to get a message across.andP;  The datagram concept,however, cannot guarantee that a message will arrive at any specific time orthat it will be free of errors or duplications; it does not even guaranteethat delivery will occur.andP;  If you want any of these assurances, you have toimplement them in higher-level software.andM;The messages sent as datagrams on Ethernet take the form of self-containedpackets of information.andP;  These packets have fields containing informationabout their destination and origin and the sort of data they contain, not tomention the data itself.andP;  Because the data field in each packet can be nolarger than 1,500 bytes, large messages must traverse the network in multiplepackets.andP;  (Articles statistically describing the efficiency of packettransmission systems have been the favorite filler of professional journalssince Bob Metcalfe published his Harvard Ph.D.andP;  thesis, &quot;PacketCommunications,&quot; in 1973.)andM;You may notice that one element of the packet structure in the illustrationis different from that codified by the IEEE 802.3 committee.andP;  The 802.3committee saw a need for a user ID in the packet.andP;  Their specification tradesthe byte count field for a user ID field.andP;  Fortunately, the network interfacecards don't care.andP;  They take their data from higher-level software that setsup the packets.andP;  Ethernet and 802.3 packets can traverse the same network,but nodes operating under one packet format can't exchange data with nodesdesigned for the other format without software translation taking place atsome level.andM;LISTEN BEFORE YOU TRANSMITandM;Before packets can traverse the coaxial cable of the Ethernet network asdatagrams, they must deal with CSMA/CD, the media access protocol thatdetermines how nodes on the network share access to the cable.andM;CSMA/CD works in a listen-before-transmit mode: if the network adapterreceives data to send from higher-level software, it checks to see if anyother station is broadcasting on the cable.andP;  Only when the cable is cleardoes the network adapter broadcast its message.andM;CSMA/CD also mediates when the inevitable happens: when two or more nodessimultaneously start to transmit on an idle cable and the transmissionscollide.andP;  The adapters can detect such collisions because of the higherelectrical-signal level that simultaneous transmissions produce.andP;  When theydetect a collision, the network adapter cards begin transmitting what iscalled a jam signal to ensure that all the conflicting nodes notice thecollision.andP;  Then each adapter stops transmitting and goes to its internalprogramming to determine a randomly selected time for retransmission.andM;This &quot;back-off&quot; period ensures that the stations don't continue to send outcolliding signals every time the cable grows quiet.andM;Benchmark Tests: Ethernet Adapter CardsandM;Admittedly, not all of the network configurations we used to test the adaptercards are equal.andP;  The cards with 16-bit addressing and on-board processingare in a different league (and price range) from those with 8-bit addressing.andO;To test server driver software and workstation driver software separately,the optimal test network had boards with 16-bit addressing in its server,with 8-bit boards on the workstations.andP;  But not all of the companiesproviding cards for us make both 8-bit and 16-bit cards; of those that do,only 3Com supplied us with both.andM;As a result, we were forced to set up the rest of the networks with the same(8-bit or 16-bit) boards in the workstations as in the server.andP;  The networksmade up of 8-bit cards, therefore, may appear inordinately slow.andP;  In actualinstallations, we recommend using a 16-bit card in the server, even if youchoose cards from another vendor for the workstations.andM;Besides the bit-addressing size, we found that two factors significantlyaffect performance: the amount of buffer memory and the driver softwaredesign.andP;  The amount of buffer memory on the network interface cards shouldaffect performance, because with larger memory-storage space the card doesnot have to wait for the computer to empty the buffer before accepting a newpacket.andP;  The driver software (provided by the vendors of the Ethernet cardsor, in some cases, by Novell) determines how the drivers handle the data; howthey interface with their host computers is an important factor inperformance.andP;  Nevertheless, because of the interaction of severalfactors--buffer size, driver software, and data bus size--it is not possibleto pinpoint the effect of one factor in any specific case.andM;Though Ethernet's data transmission speed is rated at 10 megabits per second,research by Digital Equipment Corp. and other companies shows that evenheavily used networks with multiple servers do not average over a megabit persecond of throughput.andP;  The factors that limit effective throughput on aPC-based LAN include the data transfer rate of the server's hard disk--and ofthe computer's data bus--and the efficiency of the networking software.andP;  Forthis review, all these factors remained the same, as we were trying to flushout differences among the Ethernet cards themselves; hence the absence of ourHard Disk Access Load and Database Load benchmark tests.andP;  Were we to testserver-based functions such as software response, the results would simplyvary with the performance of the cards.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
