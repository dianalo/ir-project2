The energy concern said proceeds from the transaction, coupled with proceeds from a sale completed in 1987, will total about $195 million and will be used to retire debt.    Although Transco said that as part of the agreements it couldn't identify the buyers, Houston-based American Exploration Co. disclosed it bought properties in Texas, Louisiana and the Rocky Mountain region, at a cost of $62 million. American Exploration, an oil and gas producer, said it purchased the properties with estimated proved reserves of 57 billion cubic feet of natural gas and oil measured in terms equivalent to natural gas, on behalf of partnerships and other investor programs it manages. </TEXT></DOC>
