Mailing address: FAA, NorthwestMountain Region, 17900 Pacific Highway South, C-68966, Seattle, Washington98168.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>A proposal to amend Part 39 of theFederal Aviation Regulations, to include a new airworthiness directiveapplicable to Airbus Industrie Model A300 series airplanes, which requiresrepetitive inspections of the rear passenger/crew door for cracks, andmodification, if necessary, was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 31, 1988 (53 FR 33496).Interested parties have been afforded an opportunity to participate inthe making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the twocomments received. One commenter supported the proposed rule.The other commenter supported the proposed rule, but suggested that theinspections required for the Model A300, A310, and A300-60 series airplanesbe addressed in one AD action, since the parallel French AirworthinessDirective encompassed all three airplanes in one document. The FAA doesnot concur. Since each required inspection and modification are describedin separate service bulletins for each airplane, the FAA has determinedthat addressing the requirements for each airplane model in separate rulemakingactions will pose less confusion to affected operators.Since service bulletins are always subject to change, this commenter suggestedthat, wherever the latest issue of the service bulletin is cited in thefinal rule, the words ``or later approved revision'' be added. The FAAdoes not concur. Since service bulletins issued by foreign manufacturers,and revisions thereto, are not subject to approval by the FAA, use of sucha phrase would be inappropriate. Furthermore, reference in AD's to futureservice bulletins is contrary to FAA policy. However, later revisions ofthe service bulletin may be used if they are approved as an alternate meansof compliance, as provided by paragaph C. of the final rule.This commenter also noted that all the service bulletins cited in the Noticehave been revised, and that the final rule should cite the latest revisionto the service bulletins. The FAA concurs. Since the issuance of the Notice,Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin A300-53-220, Revision 1, datedJuly 8, 1988, and Service Bulletin A300-53-221, Revision 2, dated October13, 1988, which clarify and update the procedures for the required inspectionsand the modifications. Paragraphs A. and B. of the final rule have beenrevised to reflect the latest revision of these service bulletins. TheFAA has determined that these changes will not increase the economic burdenon any operator, nor will they increase the scope of the AD.This commenter also noted typographical error in paragraph A. of the proposedrule. The Notice cited Airbus Service Bulletin ``A300-53-200;'' it shouldhave read ``A300-53-220.'' The final rule has been revised accordingly.This commenter also suggested that a separate paragraph be added to thefinal rule to require operators to contact the manufacturer for repairinstructions if cracks exceeding 0.8 inch are found. The FAA does not concur,since to do so would be delegating FAA rulemaking authority to the manufacturer.Moreover, the FAA has determined that all cracks equal to or greater than0.8 inch must be repaired prior to further flight, as was proposed in theNotice.After careful review of the available data, including the comments notedabove, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest requirethe adoption of the rule with the change previously noted.It is estimated that 53 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected bythis AD, that it will take approximately 9 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost will be $40 per manhour.Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD to U.S. operatorsis estimated to be $19,080.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this regulationis not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291 or significantunder DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979) and it is further certified under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act that this rule does not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities becauseof the minimal cost of compliance per airplane ($360). A final evaluationhas been prepared for this regulation and has been placed in the docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
