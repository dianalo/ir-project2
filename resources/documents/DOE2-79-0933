This paperaddresses the implementation of computer security in eight stages throughthe life cycle of the system; starting with the definition of securitypolicies and ending with continuing support for the security aspectsof the system throughout its operational life cycle. Security policyis addressed relative to successive decomposition of security objectives(through policy, standard, and control stages) into system security requirements.This is followed by a discussion of computer security organization andresponsibilities. Next the paper directs itself to analysis and managementof security-related risks, followed by discussion of design and developmentof the system itself. Discussion of security test and evaluation preparations,and approval to operate (certification and accreditation), is followedby discussion of computer security training for users is followed bycoverage of life cycle support for the security of the system.</TEXT></DOC>
