The Federal Reserve Board conditioned its approval yesterday on the issuance of stock to cover the cash portion of the tender offer, currently $264 million, to prevent any loss of bank capital due to the merger. The Fed mandated that 60% of the new stock be issued before the merger. Bank of New York said it is &quot;confident that it can meet&quot; the requirement &quot;promptly and fully.&quot;    Earlier in the day, the New York State Banking Board unanimously approved the merger without conditions.    An Irving spokesman said of the Fed approval, &quot;We're disappointed that the Fed has not endorsed our position about the inadequacy of the capital in the resultant institution. We believe the Bank of New York stock issue will be extremely dilutive for shareholders.&quot;    The actions eliminate the main regulatory barriers to a merger that would create the nation's 12th-largest banking concern. By illustrating that regulators won't shield banks from hostile takeovers, which have been rare in banking, they also could start a rash of raids by banks seeking to take over others.    Shortly after the Fed decision was announced, Bank of New York said that it will nominate a slate of 16 directors at Irving's April 21 annual meeting, setting the stage for a proxy fight.    Yesterday, Irving said it will continue to resist Bank of New York's offer of about $60 a-share. It also said the New York Banking Board's action &quot;appears to run counter to the statutory standards for such approvals which the board is required to follow.&quot;    On Tuesday, Irving issued $100 million in preferred stock with covenants aimed at preventing its sale to an acquirer. But Bank of New York lawyer H. Rodgin Cohen voiced confidence that &quot;this should not be a serious problem.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Irving jumped $3, to $53.50, while Bank of New York eased 12.5 cents to $29.50. The markets closed after the merger received state approval, but before the Fed had made its decision.    The banking industry has been closely watching how regulators respond to the unusual case of an unfriendly offer for a bank. In the past, almost all hostile bank mergers have either been dropped, as with First Interstate Bancorp.'s proposal to take over BankAmerica Corp., or have turned into friendly transactions before regulators had to act.    In its order, the Fed said it applies the law &quot;equally&quot; in hostile and friendly takeovers. But in hostile takeovers, it said, it &quot;pays special attention to assuring that the statutory criteria are met.&quot;    Thus, the board said it would be reluctant to give Bank of New York more than one extension of the initial 90 days to consummate the merger. Normally, extensions of the 90-day rule are granted freely. But in the pending merger, the board wants &quot;to avoid a long and fruitless struggle,&quot; said Michael Bradfield, the Fed's general counsel.    The Federal Reserve's requirement to issue new stock is designed to prevent any capital from draining out of the two banks as a result of a takeover, according to Mr. Bradfield. But the requirement is flexible. If the Bank of New York reduces the cash portion of its offer, the amount of new stock it has to issue would shrink commensurately.    Mr. Cohen, Bank of New York's lawyer, said the Fed previously has required issuance of stock to replace part of the cash paid to stockholders in merger tender offers, but never before has mandated full replacement.    The Fed found no significant danger to competition from the merger and called on Bank of New York to expand the area where it meets community banking needs.    J. Carter Bacot, chairman and chief executive officer of Bank of New York, said he was &quot;pleased and gratified,&quot; by yesterday's state and federal approvals. </TEXT></DOC>
