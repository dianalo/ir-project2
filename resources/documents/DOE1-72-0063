The method tolerated the presencesof a large number of anions and cations commonly associated with iron,and was successfully tested with certified samples of coal fly ash, alloys,and plant tissues. It was also applied to the analysis of animal tissues,natural waters, and waste waters; validating it by standard additiontechnique. PFHA was selected from nine new hydroxamic acids.</TEXT></DOC>
