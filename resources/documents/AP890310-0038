Asshe traveled north to the United States, the question was always thesame.   ``Do you want to go further? Then hand over money,'' the youngSalvadoran refugee said, crying a bit as she cuddled her 5-year-olddaughter.   Central Americans such as Ms. Ticas _ refugees fleeing embattledhomelands _ say much of what they saved for their long, dangeroustrip north was slowly sapped by an assortment of smugglers, busdrivers and corrupt officials.   ``It happens at all the checkpoints there are,'' said a27-year-old Honduran woman who gave her name only as Margarita.``They ask for papers on the bus and the ones who don't have papersthey tell to give them money.''   Beginning soon after they enter Mexico from Guatemala, theCentral Americans say, people who identify themselves as authoritiesdemand money to allow them to continue.   Some also complained of robberies by people they said identifiedthemselves as police and of extortion by others, including busdrivers.   Spokesmen for the Attorney General's Office and the InteriorDepartment said they knew of no formal complaints of abuses bypeople in their departments.   Central Americans have been flooding north through Mexico, butthey no longer can legally enter the United States and apply forpolitical asylum without being detained.   Many have searched for smugglers to help them across the RioGrande from this border town, but others say they have run out ofmoney.   The refugees, many of them in Mexico illegally, gave only generallocations for checkpoints and were unfamiliar with the multiplegovernment agencies, making it unlikely they could file a complainteven if they were willing to go to authorities.   Ms. Ticas sat in a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas, asshe recalled the arduous, costly journey from eastern El Salvadorthat ended with her detention this week shortly after entering theUnited States.   She said those who stopped the buses at about five differentpoints ``from when we entered Mexico until we left Mexico'' took atotal of between $215 and $260 in Mexican pesos, part of the $700she had when she entered the country.   At one stop, men were forced to strip to prove they weren'thiding money, she said. She had to shake her clothes and jacket.   She managed to hide a roll of bills but left behind a smallsuitcase of clothing as part payment, she said.   ``There are many scoundrels who commit abuses, who passthemselves off as police officers,'' Rene Hernandez of the AttorneyGeneral's Office said.   Both he and Hector Rivera of the Interior Department'simmigration services office said Central Americans must file formalcomplaints saying who demanded the money and where the incidentsoccurred.   They said they could refer to any of at least four differentpolice forces, as well as customs and immigration agents, all underseparate government departments.   A few said they reached the border without having to pay, butextortion was the first aspect of the trip mentioned by many and oneof the main reasons they gave for having little or no money left.   Cirse Amador, 22, a Nicaraguan, said the routine is common amongauthorities and others.   ``They say, `You're not from here. If you want to get to MexicoCity you're going to have to give some dough,''' she said.   She said about six people paid the bus driver $65, down from hisasking price of $86, to get them by the checkpoints.   ``The bus drivers took my last $73,'' Luis Alonso Avalos, aSalvadoran said. ``They said we had passed two checkpoints and thatwas what it was worth.''</TEXT></DOC>
