(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Caterpillar Inc. and the United Auto Workersagreed Friday to extend their contract indefinitely, averting amidnight strike, while negotiations continued at Deere andamp; Co.struggling to beat the same deadline.   The extension agreement between Peoria-based Caterpillar and theUAW came just 12 hours before the current contract would haveexpired, possibly triggering a walkout by 17,500 blue-collarCaterpillar workers in five states.   The negotiations were recessed with no time set for a resumption.   But at Deere, the possibility remained for a strike by 13,400workers at midnight CDT, as negotiations continued near thecompany's headquarters in Moline, Ill.   ``We're continuing to talk as planned,'' said Robert Combs, aDeere spokesman. ``We're meeting right now. I'm sure they'llcontinue to meet through the day. I think it's significant thattalks picked up right away this morning.''   Elliott Anderson, a chief UAW negotiator in the Caterpillartalks, said the union decided to concentrate its efforts on Deereand would likely use a settlement with Deere as a ``pattern'' forfuture talks with Caterpillar.   At both Deere and Caterpillar, job security, increases in payand pensions, a reduction in overtime and a callback of laid-offworkers were at issue. Neither the union nor the companies wouldreveal their specific contract proposals.   A Deere walkout would affect 13,400 factory workers in 11 citiesin Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Colorado and Georgia. The companyemploys about 38,000 people worldwide.   Karl Mantyla, a UAW spokesman in Detroit, said the union was notinterested in extending Deere's contract. ``It's a hard and fastdeadline, as far as we're concerned,'' he said.   Elliott Anderson, a chief UAW negotiator at the Caterpillartalks, said the union was shifting all of its attention to Deerebecause ``we think that's the best place where we've had somemovement.''   Anderson said the union likely would use a settlement with Deereas a ``pattern'' for talks with Caterpillar. ``We're going to takea look at Deere and see what we can do about doing the same thinghere,'' he said.   UAW officials began meeting daily with Deere on Aug. 11, seekingto restore salary cuts accepted in the 1987 contract.   At the Caterpillar talks in the St. Louis suburb of Bridgeton,Mo., which began Aug. 4, union bargainers have been seeking thefirst merit pay raise in 10 years for workers at plants in 12cities in Illinois, Iowa, Colorado, Tennessee and Pennsylvania.Caterpillar has 58,800 employees worldwide.   During the 1986 negotiations, the previous contract was extendedfour times before a settlement was reached without a strike.   The extension requires each side to give a five-day notice ifthey wish to terminate the agreement, said Mark Polzin, aCaterpillar spokesman.   Although workers for both companies were drawing up theirpicket-duty rosters and making other strike preparations, there wasa universal desire to avoid a walkout.   But some workers preferred a walkout to a contract extension andthat view was apparent Friday in some Caterpillar shops.   ``I don't think the reaction will be good among the workingpeople, the people in the plant,'' said Ed Woker, vice president ofLocal 751 in Decatur, Ill. ``There's a lot of hard feelings. Theissues are there and they feel that there should be a settlement.''   Philip Euler, at Local 2096 in Pontiac, Ill., said: ``I'vetalked to people here and they're not happy. Everybody feelsthere's been adequate time to settle this thing. To make thisindefinite does not make them happy. Nobody wants a strike, butnobody wants an extension.''</TEXT></DOC>
