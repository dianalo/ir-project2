The men were described as experienced climbers with excellentgear and a radio, although contact has not been made.   ``The ingredients (for survival) are there if they can put ittogether,'' Ranger Bob Seibert said Thursday. ``It's been a longtime, though. It sure has.''   Hurricane-force wind around North America's largest peakprevented rugged Army helicopters from joining the search Thursday.An Air Force plane sent up to check wind conditions around the peak65 miles from Talkeetna reached the 14,000-foot level andencountered turbulence.   Crews planned to try again today.   The climbers were seen by an Austrian team on Feb. 22. TheAustrians were descending and the apanese, who set out Feb. 16, wereascending the 20,320-foot peak.   ``It took the Austrians a few days to get down. Nobody has heardfrom the Japanese since,'' said John Quinley, a park servicespokesman.   The climbers' rations probably ran out days ago, but the ParkService has a cache of food and water at 17,200 feet, Quinley said.   Members of the Japanese party are leader Noboru Yamada, 39, TeruoSaegusa, 31, and Kozo Komatsu, 34, all of Tokyo.</TEXT></DOC>
