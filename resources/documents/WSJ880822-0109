First, some background: A year ago, spurred by the Financial Executives Research Foundation and the accounting firm of Deloitte Haskins andamp; Sells, General Motors Corp. approached the Securities and Exchange Commission with the question, in essence, &quot;Wouldn't it be sufficient if we included all the SEC-mandated material in either the annual or the proxy?&quot; Among other things, they queried, are publicly held companies required to include the notes to the financials in the annual report? The SEC's main concern -- articulated subsequently in New York by an SEC enforcement lawyer who appeared confused over the difference between the annual report and proxy statement -- was that sufficient information get to the stockholders prior to the voting of proxies, not where that information appeared.    The result, as students of the species know: bold predictions of demise of the traditional annual report (which has been around since 1827), along with the promise of popularity of the approved, abbreviated annual report -- quickly labeled a summary report or SAR. One financial printer, Sorg, foresaw upward of 100 summaries for 1987 -- an overestimate about which Sorge would rather forget. Our computerized tracking of annuals from around the world indicates that only a dozen or so SARs appeared on the scene, a minuscule 1.7% of the reports studied in this sixth year of our monitoring of the document.    To some, the fact that reality fell so far short of anticipation of the SAR's acceptance proved once again that left to its devices, the marketplace will make evident its preferences quite well, thank you.    What, one asks, does the marketplace have to do with introduction of a foreshortened version of the annual report? For one thing, a poll by the public-relations firm Hill andamp; Knowlton of Wall Street analysts revealed overwhelming opposition to the concept of the SAR. More than one analyst polled promised to dissuade investors from putting their dollars into companies producing the &quot;down-and-dirty&quot; report. One said adamantly, &quot;If a company did produce an SAR, I wouldn't follow {it} anymore.&quot; Were the SAR a product, said Hill andamp; Knowlton senior vice president Ned Raynolds, it would be described as &quot;a product with no consumer demand.&quot;    Even some corporations themselves chimed in with opposition. Quaker Oats, whose annuals are among the world's best, &quot;is on record as planning to continue holding nothing back from the annual report and to keep striving for greater readability and more graphic comprehensibility. Most other companies also feel it is better to overdo the annual and have large parts of it go unread than to underdo it and leave readers in the dark.&quot;    Another leader in the field, Richard A. Lewis, whose Corporate Annual Reports Inc. turns out dozens of reports every year for major U.S. corporations, wrote for a board-oriented magazine that managers who support the SAR &quot;are out of touch with their own CEOs, who are unlikely to favor 'improvements' that emasculate the report and make it less interesting to analysts, portfolio managers and other institutional investors who have the greatest influence on stock prices.&quot;    USX Corp., NCR and many others, after careful study, opposed converting to the SAR. The Pittsburgh steelmaker said that &quot;Although we continue to study the summary report concept, we are comfortable for the time being with the all-inclusive document.&quot; Dayton, Ohio's NCR declared: &quot;After examining the pros and cons of the summary annual report, there was a strong feeling that NCR should not change the basic contents of its financial presentation. Instead of reducing the amount of disclosure by moving certain financial statements and notes to the proxy statement or 10-K report, the NCR staff determined to improve the financial review section of its report by creating stronger charts and graphs to complement the financial facts and figures.&quot;    Nonetheless, at least 13 companies -- none outside the U.S. -- did opt to introduce the short report. American Fructose and American Maize-Products Co., among others, included a response card enabling recipients to say if they preferred the summary report &quot;and would like to see it next year.&quot; Kroger also provided stockholders with a post card signed by the chairman and CEO on which stockholders were asked to vote &quot;what you think about this new format,&quot; which he said was &quot;about half the length of previous annuals.&quot; SPX Corp., whose SAR at 40 pages (average among SARs: 24 pages, or more than 40% less stockholder information than the standard report contains on average) is this year's longest.    Another SAR producer during the year was Harry E. Figgie's Figgie International. His company did the others one better: simultaneously turning out an SAR and what at first glance appeared to be a traditional report. On further inspection, one found that between an attractive cover and back was simply the legalistic, SEC-required Form 10-K. Figgie, too, solicited response to the summary concept via post cards bound into the book.    In its first year out, the summary report was a decided bomb. Even GM, which began the brouhaha with its correspondence-made-public, opted not to reduce the size of its annual, reportedly because it &quot;didn't need any more bad publicity&quot; right now. Good judgment indeed.    Corporate Annual Reports' Mr. Lewis believes the SAR concept was killed by the October stock crash. &quot;Although several of our 40 clients seriously considered producing a summary annual report {before the crash}, in the final analysis, none did,&quot; he says.    Whatever reason for its failure to catch on, the controversy promises to linger, which may not be all that bad. After all, many are unable to recall the last time excitement of any note was visited upon the staid old annual report industry.    ---   Mr. Cato is editor/publisher of a newsletter on annual reports based in Waukesha, Wis. </TEXT></DOC>
