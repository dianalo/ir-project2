You've read the mutual fund sales literature, you'vestudied the rankings of top-performing funds, you've listenedto the gurus. But at some point, if you're going to get themost out of mutual funds, you actually have to start puttingyour money to work.   Where to begin? For those who are faint of heart, here arefive ways to ease your way into mutual fund investing:                                                                                                          Try a money fund. As a first step, fund analysts suggestinvesting in a money market fund. Money funds seek tomaintain a stable $1 share price by investing in only thevery shortest-term debt securities.   &quot;Money funds tend to pay more than bank money marketaccounts, so you might as well start there,&quot; says KurtBrouwer, president of Brouwer andamp; Janachowski, a San Franciscoinvestment adviser.   By owning a money fund, you will get a sense of how amutual fund operates. And because fund groups allow you toswitch money out of a money fund and into their other fundssimply by making a telephone call, you will bewell-positioned for when you decide to become moreadventurous.   Money funds give shareholders check-writing privileges,which can be useful if you want to buy a mutual fund fromanother fund group. Check-writing privileges also areavailable on some bond funds, but you may not want to usethis facility. Because the share price of a bond fundfluctuates, every time you write a check you end up taking acapital gain or loss, which then has to be accounted for onyour tax return.                                                                                                          Invest automatically. Many fund groups now let you investin their funds using a regular monthly deduction from yourchecking or savings account. The advantage of these plans isthat they force you to use a fund-buying strategy known asdollar cost averaging.   This strategy works particularly well with stock funds. Byinvesting fixed amounts at regular intervals, shareholdersend up buying fewer shares when the stock market is up andthe fund's shares are pricey, and more shares when the marketis down and the fund's shares are cheap. Because stock pricestend to rise over time, you should eventually end up owningfund shares that are worth far more than the price you paidfor them. &quot;Dollar cost averaging is talked about again andagain, but it does make a heap of sense,&quot; says Don Phillips,editor of Mutual Fund Values, a Chicago newsletter.   Some funds have even taken the automatic investment planone step further. These funds will accept new investors whomake no initial investment, providing these new shareholderssign up for the fund's automatic investment plan.   Gabelli Asset Fund, which regularly demands a hefty$25,000 minimum investment, will let investors in with nomoney down so long as they agree to invest $100 or more amonth automatically. Similarly, both Denver's Janus Group ofMutual Funds and Baltimore's T. Rowe Price Associates willlet investors into their funds for nothing, providing theyagree to make $50 investments on a regular basis.   Automatic investment plans shouldn't be confused withcontractual plans. While both types of plans involveinvesting fixed amounts on a monthly basis, contractual plansare sold through brokers and involve paying hefty commissionson the initial monthly investments.                                                                                                          Adopt a family. For those at a loss as to where to start,one strategy is to settle on one of the big no-load fundgroups and then distribute your money among various of thefund company's stock, bond and money funds.   &quot;If you talk about a big fund group like T. Rowe Price orVanguard or Scudder, the funds are going to be well run, theexpenses are going to be reasonable and you're going to getsome guidance,&quot; says Kenneth Gregory, editor of L/G No-LoadFund Analyst, a San Francisco newsletter.   Large fund families typically offer all the differenttypes of funds you might need to construct a well-diversifiedmutual fund portfolio. But in addition, these fund groupswill often help investors work out exactly what thedifferences are between the various funds. &quot;The well-knownfund groups are starting to do a really good job of providingeducational materials,&quot; notes Mr. Gregory.                                                                                                          Start small. For those who want to get their feet wetwithout committing a lot of cash, there are a number oftop-ranked stock funds that are open to investors who want toinvest only small sums.   Twentieth Century Investors, of Kansas City, Mo., managessome of the fund industry's best-performing growth funds anddemands no minimum initial investment. The fund group does,however, charge a $10 account fee if your balance is below$1,000 at the end of the year. Denver's Financial Funds,which includes the top-performing Financial Industrial IncomeFund, will let shareholders into its funds for just $250.   Even if you can afford to invest in a fund with a $25,000or $50,000 minimum, you might want to stick with funds thatdemand a lower initial investment. The reason: With ahigh-minimum fund, you may have to invest all your money in asingle purchase, whereas with a low minimum fund you can usedollar cost averaging.   In addition, if you invest in a large sum all at once, youhave to be especially careful to avoid &quot;buying a dividend.&quot;This happens when you invest just before a fund makes acapital gains or income distribution, which you then have topay tax on, even though you have only just become ashareholder. If you call and ask, most funds will tell youwhether they are about to make a distribution. If that's thecase, you may want to delay making your investment.                                                                                                          Consider indexing. Index funds simply buy and hold thestocks that make up a particular stock market index, andthereby hope to track the index's performance. The mostpopular index funds are those that buy the large-companystocks that make up the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index.Major fund groups such as Dreyfus Corp., Fidelity Investmentsand Vanguard Group now offer Sandamp;P 500 funds.   In terms of stock market value, the Sandamp;P 500 stockscomprise 73% of the U.S. market. If you also want to indexthe other 27%, the only choice is the Vanguard ExtendedMarket Portfolio. The fund buys all U.S. stocks that aren'tincluded in the Sandamp;P 500.   Indexing offers two key advantages. You don't have toworry about the fund manager quitting or his investment stylegoing out of favor. And if history is any guide, you canexpect to outpace the average stock fund. According to LipperAnalytical Services, if you had indexed the entire stockmarket for the past decade, you would have done better thantwo-thirds of all diversified domestic stock funds.</TEXT></DOC>
