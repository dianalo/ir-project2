Mr. Linkletter, featured in ads for National Home Life Assurance Co., joins celebrities such as Ed McMahon, Tennessee Ernie Ford and the late Lorne Greene as spokesmen whose ads have been bounced from the state's television screens. Currently, an advertisement featuring Dick Van Dyke is under official review.    Washington's insurance commissioner told National Home Life that it can no longer run an insurance advertisement featuring Mr. Linkletter. A cease and decist order obtained by the commissioner charges that, despite the advertisement's assertions that policy premiums would never change, ultra-fine print in mailings to policy holders said rates were subject to change at any time, making the ads &quot;not just misleading but false,&quot; said Patricia Petersen, the state's deputy insurance commissioner.    National Home Life, of Valley Forge, Pa., said it already has discontinued the Linkletter ad and called the discrepancy between the ad's claims and the wording of its policy &quot;an honest but very unfortunate mistake.&quot; A spokeswoman said consumers who bought the policies would receive new documents that make good the no-increase-in-premiums guarantee.    The state's crackdown on certain life insurance ads began last June, when it banned other National Home Life ads featuring Mr. Ford and the late Mr. Greene, and an ad for Colonial Penn Franklin Insurance Co. featuring Mr. McMahon. Neither Philadelphia-based Colonial Penn nor the celebrities in question could be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
