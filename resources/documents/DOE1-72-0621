These orthorhombic compounds(type Li Eu/sub 3/O/sub 4/) allow the study of many magnetic phenomenaand their evolution in function of the nature of Ln(II) and Ln(III):diamagnetic ions Sr/sup 2+/, Y/sup 3+/; isotrope magnetic ions: Eu/sup2+/, Gd/sup 3+/ and anisotrope magnetic ions Dy /sup 3+/, Er/sup 3+/.Magnetic and electric properties are obtained by classical techniquesand from hyperfine interaction by Moessbauer spectroscopy. The possibilityto use several Moessbauer resonance (nuclei Eu 151, Gd 155, Dy 161 andEr 166) completes informations obtained by the macroscopic study.</TEXT></DOC>
