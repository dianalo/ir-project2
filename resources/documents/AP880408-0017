Kirk Jr.says he wants to minimize the clash of interest groups so his partycan draft a 1988 platform that Democrats ``can run with and not shyaway from.''   But Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard, chairman of the platformcommittee, says at least one interest group will be courted thisyear: the business community.   ``They think socially they have to be Republicans, for whateverreason. But the majority are really independent people,'' Blanchardsaid. ``I would like to see special efforts with the businesscommunity.''   Kirk and Blanchard said Thursday there will be state andregional platform hearings around the country over the next twomonths.   Some interest groups said they welcomed this news, since Kirkearlier suggested there might be only two _ in Washington andAtlanta.   But they scoffed at what they called an effort to keepcontroversial planks out of the platform.   ``We are concerned about statements that they did not wish tocater to special interests, they want to open up the process and tobring in new groups,'' said Molly Yard, president of the NationalAssociation for Women.   ``It seems to us that business is also a special interest, andwe don't understand quite how women, who are over half thepopulation, can be categorized as a special interest.''   Kirk and Blanchard pledged to draft a lean document and avoidthe kind of divisive battles that have marked previous efforts atwriting party platforms.   ``I'd like to think that someone will read it other thanopponents,'' Blanchard said. ``The platform is more than just whatMichael Dukakis or Jesse Jackson thinks. It has to be one allDemocrats are comfortable with.''   Even so, Kirk said that Jackson would have ``significantrepresentation'' on the platform committee, regardless of whobecomes the party nominee. He called Jackson's campaign ``animportant constructive force within the Democratic party.''   At the same time, Kirk seemed to soften suggestions he made lastDecember that platform writers would avoid emotionally chargedissues on which there was not common agreement.   He vowed Thursday the party would not ``sound a retreat'' fromissues it had championed in the past, including the Equal RightsAmendment and abortion rights.   Asked specifically about abortion, Kirk said: ``I think ourparty has always embraced the rights of privacy, the rights ofindividual choice.''   However, he tempered his comments by saying that such issues``can be addressed in a way without being divisive orcontroversial.''   ``I think we can put together a platform that a nationalaudience can respond to and that all elected Democratic officialscan run with and not shy away from,'' Kirk said.   ``I would have been much happier if he said, `we will of coursekeep equal rights and abortion planks,'' said Eleanor Smeal,president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority.   Turning to the Democratic campaign, Kirk joined New York Gov.Mario Cuomo in urging Sen. Albert Gore Jr. to tone down hisnegative campaigning. He called Cuomo's admonition to the Tennesseesenator to stop criticizing Jackson and Dukakis ``helpful and oncourse.''   Kirk also reiterated his view that Cuomo would not become apresidential candidate, even in a brokered convention. ``There is agame going on on the field,'' he said. ``That's where the nominee'sgoing to be be chosen from.''</TEXT></DOC>
