(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Elk and bison in fireravaged Yellowstone would be better helped by long-term solutionsrather than by donations of hay, says the National Park Servicedirector.   A severe winter and loss of natural foods because of lastsummer's drought and huge fires have driven hundreds of elk andbison over the park boundary into southern Montana.   In the small Montana town of Gardiner, north of the park,starving elk are eating ornamental hedges, trees, and hay donated bysympathetic people. Small herds of elk and buffalo have congregatedin town.   ``They are skinny and weak,'' said Trudi Taylor, who helped raisemoney to feed the animals after one elk died in her yard. She saidshe hopes to save younger cows that will soon calve.   ``In this town, most of the people make their money off theseanimals. At least they could give a little back,'' she said,referring to the area's popularity with hunters and tourists.   But feeding hay to elk is expensive and can spread disease whenelk gather at feeding stations, Park Service Director William PennMott told a news conference at park headquarters.   Once rangers start providing hay to elk in Yellowstone, theexpensive practice could continue indefinitely, like at the nationalelk refuge in Jackson, said Mott, who was sent on a fact-findingtrip Saturday by new Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.   Almost 500 of Yellowstone's 2,700 bison have been shot in Montanain a state-sanctioned hunt, and 250 additional permits have beenissued. More than 2,350 elk from Yellowstone's northern herd of19,000 were shot by Montana hunters this winter. Inside Yellowstone,rangers have counted more than 300 elk carcasses.   Mott said one option he could support was to have the federalgovernment acquire more winter game range in Montana north of thepark. The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation of Missoula, Mont.,announced Friday that it will start a special fund toward expandingwinter range for Yellowstone's northern elk herd.   Mott also said he will ask the Park Service, other federal andstate agencies and conservation groups to help draft a report tolook at Yellowstone's total wildlife management program, which hecalled fragmented.   ``This is needed so that everybody knows what is going to be donefor long-term management of Yellowstone Park and preservation of thearea,'' he said.   Mott said he hoped a wildlife report would be completed withinsix months.   ``We will look at the total ecosystem and how to best managewildlife. If land is being overgrazed, we should look at this.''   Mott repeated his support for reintroduction of wolves intoYellowstone, saying they could help keep big-game populations inbalance and are part of the West's ``biological diversity.''   Elk and bison populations in Yellowstone are near all-time highsbecause of recent mild winters.   The big-game herds are in no danger of extinction, but in someareas visitors may see fewer animals this year, he said.   ``Even if winter kill (of northern herd elk) is 50 percent, therewould still be a core that would rapidly reproduce,'' he said.   Mary Meagher, a Yellowstone biologist, said ``bison have thebiological capacity of recovering from low numbers.'' She recalledthat the park's hundreds of bison started with a remnant populationof 22 animals.   Montana officials authorized a bison hunt because about half ofYellowstone's bison carry the disease brucellosis, which somescientists say could be transmitted to cattle.   But Meagher said her best information from the Montana stateveterinarian was that no cases of brucellosis in that state had beentraced to Yellowstone Park animals. She pointed out that ranchersvaccinate their calves against the disease.   Last year, only 39 bison were shot in Montana's hunt, and thisyear's hunt has been denounced as a slaughter by activists such asCleveland Amory, president of the Fund for Animals.</TEXT></DOC>
