School officials, sensitive to the feelings of those distraughtparents and frustrated by their inability to judge the academiccompetence and character of toddlers, have decided to close thepreschool.   ``It's difficult enough to select good students when they're 17and 18. It's almost impossible to make distinctions _ except on theedges, if they're extraordinarily brilliant or retarded _ when theyare 2{,'' James W. Wickenden, co-chairman of Dalton's admissionsand scholarship committee and a former dean of admissions atPrinceton University, said Monday.   New Yorkers hunting for the fast lane to the right track fortheir children will now have to wait for kindergarten to begintheir frantic push to get their youngsters into Dalton.   The board of trustees voted last month to phase out the nurseryschool over the next two years as the 34 children who enter inSeptember at age 3 proceed to kindergarten.   School spokesman Frank J. Carnabuci said the process had becomesomething of ``a rat race.''   The competitive admission to Dalton was lampooned in the movie``Baby Boom,'' when a mother tried to cope with her daughter'srejection.   ``I don't understand,'' she said. ``Her resume was perfect, herreferences impeccable.''   For parents, their offspring's failure to get into an elitenursery is ``their wonderful little child's first rejection,'' saidCynthia Bing, who provides advice on how to get into the city'selite private schools. ``It won't be as heartbreaking when theydon't get into Harvard or Princeton.''   Admissions director Chris McDermott said there were almost sixtimes as many toddlers trying to get into the preschool as therewere openings and no reliable means for judging the littleapplicants.   Ms. McDermott said the decision was based on watching a childplay for 45 minutes with three other toddlers and talking with theparents. Often, family affiliation and space limitations were thedeciding factors, she said.   Wickenden said school administrators decided it would be betterto admit students when they are older, when test scores and otherinformation are available to help make better decisions.   Kindergarten applicants are judged by their scores on theEducational Records Bureau test, a standardized admission test, aswell as their records from nursery schools and interviews, Ms.McDermott said.   Wickenden said a greater percentage of students who entered atage 2{ had to be asked to leave the school in later grades becauseof poor performance than did youngsters who were admitted at theripe old age of 5 or 6.   ``The hope would be by delaying the admission process by 1{years, it would be fairer and the school could strengthen theacademic excellence of those admitted,'' he said.   Dr. Sirgay Sanger, a child psychiatrist in Manhattan, didn't buythose arguments. ``If you have a headache, you don't cut off thehead,'' he said.   Instead of abolishing the program, the school should improve itsselection process, especially since preschool programs are in suchdemand by working parents, Sanger said.   Children can be judged at an early age if they are studiedcarefully over an extended period, not in a 45-minute interview, hesaid. ``They can have off days and on days and you need to see themat different times.''   For parents who had their heart set on sending theirpreschoolers to Dalton, there should be some comfort in theknowledge that Manhattan has about 115 private nursery schools,with about 4,500 slots for 3- and 4-year-olds, according to theParents League of New York, an association of private schools andparents.   ``In September there will be no 3-year-olds sitting out on thestreet with nowhere to go to school,'' said Mrs. Bing.</TEXT></DOC>
