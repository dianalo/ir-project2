The suspect, Ferdinand Barnard, has been held without chargesince Oct. 31 as part an investigation into the assassinations lastyear of two white activists: Johannesburg university lecturer DavidWebster and Namibian lawyer Anton Lubowski.   Pretoria Supreme Court Justice H.J. Priess rejected a bid byBarnard's father, a retired police colonel, to have the formernarcotics detective released.   In Windhoek, Namibia, another Supreme Court judge today setApril 18 as the start of a murder trial for Donald Acheson, asuspected accomplice of Barnard who is accused of involvement inLubowksi's killing.   Lubowski, shot and killed outside his Windhoek home on Sept. 12,was the only white to hold a leadership position in Namibia'sindependence movement, the South-West African People'sOrganization. Webster, a well-known human rights activist, was shotand killed outside his Johannesburg home on May 1.   Police Brig. Floris Mostert, in testimony opposing Barnard'srelease, said the investigation into the assassinations haduncovered the existence of ``a secret organization ... with membersfrom all levels of society, which strives to terrorize left-wingradicals with the aid of violence and intimidation.''   Dozens of anti-apartheid activists have been the victims ofunsolved murders in recent years. Many others have had their carsvandalized, and there have been bombings or arson attacks onoffices of militant trade unions, civil rights groups, andopposition newspapers.   Mostert said Barnard had been in contact with Acheson prior toLubowski's murder. The brigadier also said: ``I must respectfullystress that the nature of my investigation is extremely sensitiveand that the secrecy of the information which I possess is of theutmost importance.''   Police say the Webster-Lubowski case is not directly related toinvestigations of claims that death squads within the ranks of thenational police force killed government opponents on the orders ofhigh-ranking officers.   One black ex-policeman, Butana Nofemela, has pleaded guilty tocommitting a murder as part of such a death squad, and a whiteformer captain, Dirk Coetzee, has fled abroad after telling anewspaper he commanded a death squad.   Thus far, legal steps have been taken only against Nofemela andCoetzee, not against other policemen implicated by them. This hasresulted in widespread demands for an independent judicial inquiryand accusations that President F.W. de Klerk's government isengaged in a cover-up.   Some of the white officers implicated by Coetzee appeared todayat an inquest into the deaths of four young black activists in1986. The policemen have denied allegations that the youths weremurdered, saying they were shot in self-defense by a specialcounter-insurgency unit.</TEXT></DOC>
