It conjures upvisions of companies suddenly drilling new holes, ploppingdown rigs and watching as geysers of American crude replacesome of Saddam Hussein's oil.   The reality is not so pretty. Even before Iraq's invasion,a small boom in U.S. oil exploration had come up against anugly reality: The infrastructure of oil exploration andproduction in the U.S. seriously atrophied during the '80s.</LP><TEXT>   The capacity of the U.S. oil-field service and equipmentindustry to accomplish things -- big things like buildingpipelines or small things like manufacturing drill bits --has withered to about 50% of its peak a decade ago, saysCharlie Oliver, president of Fluor Daniel Corp.'s oildivision.   Scores of companies have vanished; they've gone bankrupt,merged or simply called it quits. The survivors have slashedbudgets, cut loose most of their experienced help and soldoff equipment -- or let it rust in back lots and bayous.   The shortage of trained help is acute. Unit Corp. of Tulsahad to turn down million-dollar contracts to drill 10 newwells in the past two months because it couldn't findexperienced workers. Parker Drilling Co. dispatched more thana dozen workers all the way across Louisiana to drill a wellin Lafayette, once an oil mecca crawling with seasoned menready to work.   Warehouse shelves are nearly empty of the mundane valves,fittings and connectors that keep rigs running. In a fewmonths, the industry could actually start running out of thesuper-strength pipe used to turn drill bits.   Even ordinary earth-moving equipment and backhoes are inshort supply. Repairs of sophisticated monitoring equipmentthat once took hours now take days.   Domestic production could never again satisfy America'svoracious energy appetite, of course; it can't begin toreplace all of the 8.4 million barrels a day of petroleum nowimported. After a century of high U.S. production, theresimply isn't enough left underground. But stepped-up oil andgas output at home could at least slow the growing relianceon foreign oil.   It has happened before. After the oil price shocks of the1970s, furious exploration and drilling halted a long declinein domestic reserves and production. That, coupled withconscientious conservation, cut oil imports by the early1980s to 32% of U.S. consumption, before they rose to arecord of nearly 50% of consumption in the first half of thisyear.   Recently, savvy independents and even Big Oil have againbeen sinking new wells in the U.S. at a rising rate. Lastmonth, more than 1,000 drilling rigs were grinding away, upfrom 832 a year earlier and 663 four years ago. The incentivewas last year's steady 30% rise in U.S. crude prices to anaverage of about $20 a barrel.   Mini-oil-booms have been rocking along this year fromsagebrush towns of South Texas to Alabama, Kansas andWyoming. Drillers are working in Alaska's icy Chukchi Sea andin the deep blue waters far into the Gulf of Mexico.   Though it started with gutsy little companies, the gamehas been joined by big players in the past few months. WithDuPont Co.'s Conoco unit planning to spend upwards of $600million in 1990, &quot;we'll probably have the biggest year everin exploration,&quot; says Constantine Nicandros, the Conoco chiefexecutive.   Mobil Corp. projects annual capital spending above $5billion in a few years, 50% higher than in 1989. Exxon plansto spend $500 million developing just two Gulf of Mexicofields. Texaco Inc. raised domestic spending on exploration25% this year and expects to maintain that level at leastthrough 1995.   For many companies, natural gas is as good a target ascrude oil, because rising oil prices tend to tow gas pricesalong. Gas is also more plentiful than oil in the U.S., andcan be an effective substitute for imported oil in manyapplications. Coastal Corp. has been sitting on a backlog of500 gas discoveries, but wouldn't drill until convinced thatprices justified it. &quot;We are now beginning,&quot; James Paul, thepresident, said before the Iraqi invasion.   Because $20 oil had all that impact on U.S. output, itmight seem the new prices well above $25, if sustained,should turn the rebound into a stampede. After all, theindustry took full advantage of the oil shocks of the '70s.   Back then, however, things were different. Oil-fieldbusinesses were many, rich, well-equipped and fully staffed.Money to finance growth was beating a path to their door;everyone from New York bankers to Los Angeles dentists wantedto invest in the Oil Patch. To expand, &quot;you just placed theorders,&quot; says C.R. Palmer, chairman of the drilling companyRowan Cos.   This time, the industry is staggered, investors are waryand the infrastructure is weak. The drilling recovery &quot;couldstop short just as it gets started,&quot; warns Matthew Simmons, aHouston investment banker.   For instance, here in the Ouachita Mountains stretchingfrom Oklahoma 100 miles into Arkansas, three times as manywells are being sunk as last year -- but shortages are partof the daily routine on most rig sites. Not long ago, JeffNelson, head of a Mobil team drilling a four-mile-deep gaswell, spent half of one night looking for welders; he calledeight before he got one.   &quot;Personnel is the critical issue of the '90s,&quot; says RobertParker Jr., president of Parker Drilling, the company thatsent the workers across Louisiana. To ease such problems,Parker has reopened its &quot;drilling school&quot; in Odessa, Texas,which was closed during the mid-1980s. Ten former autoworkers there are learning to drill ultra-deep Oklahoma gaswells.   Last month, Texas Aandamp;M University began training $8-an-hourroughnecks to &quot;run pipe&quot; through wells, using an Abileneschool shuttered since 1986; the first class of seven willgraduate this month. And headhunters are scouring the countryin hopes of luring $50,000-a-year geologists andgeophysicists back to the Southwest.   Earle Lamborn, the head of oil-rig operations for UnitCorp., the firm that had to turn down contracts for lack ofmanpower, is a frustrated man. &quot;I hate that,&quot; he says. &quot;Weneed every contract we can get.&quot; Unit nearly suffocated inthe collapse of U.S. oil and gas exploration of the 1980s andhasn't made a dime in six years. The spurned contracts wouldhave raised monthly revenue more than 40%, or $1.3 million.   In 1981, the Tulsa-based contractor had 650rough-and-ready drillers on its payroll. That dropped to 410a half-dozen years ago -- and now just 220. &quot;We haven'ttrained anybody in years,&quot; he says.   And many of the trained people may be gone for good. Onepossible reason is that drilling is growing more complexbecause of technological changes, while at the same timeremaining grimy, dangerous work where bodies are bruised andfingers easily lost. Many experienced workers &quot;have foundsomething else to do and they're not apt to come back,&quot; saysRobert Spears, a Tulsa consultant.   Men like Tony Morris. Son of a roughneck and &quot;Employee ofthe Year 1980&quot; in his small drilling outfit in easternOklahoma, he epitomized those who were once the lifeblood ofthe Oil Patch. Mr. Morris left two years ago to drive trucksand vows he'll never return. &quot;I've found easier ways to makea dollar,&quot; he says. After a decade of declining wages, workand benefits, the already tough life just became tooinsecure. &quot;You don't know if you'll work the next day,&quot; hesays.   That leaves headaches for the survivors -- men like PaulMurray, a &quot;tool pusher&quot; who heads up Unit Corp. drilling rigno. 36 leased here to Mobil. &quot;As more rigs get put up, thehands jump around,&quot; he says. In fact, labor is so tight thathe was promoted after just six months with the company. Nowhe drives his white Chevy pickup 270 miles across Oklahomatwice a week to get here.   &quot;There's fixing to be a bidding war&quot; for roughnecks -- thebasic category of well worker -- mutters Dee Morris, rig 36'sother &quot;tool pusher,&quot; or man in charge of the drilling.Unshaven, unwashed and unkempt after days of nonstop work,Mr. Morris says the scuttlebutt is that competitors areoffering 50-cent-an-hour raises. Roughnecks currently earnabout $8 to $8.50 an hour. &quot;The hands are griping. I wouldn'tbe surprised if I lose a few,&quot; he says.   When that happens, it can hurt. Down the road a dozenmiles, where a Unit crew did lose a roughneck to anotherdrilling company, there now are two &quot;young guys&quot; with lessthan two weeks' experience working on the rig, says AlanWilliams, a skilled 17-year company veteran. So far, nothinghas gone wrong. But new workers frighten him because of theheightened chance of injuries.   &quot;It would be a nightmare to fire up a new rig with all newhands,&quot; he says. &quot;It probably takes a good year to train ahand where you don't have to lead him around by his hand.&quot;   The revitalization of South Texas oilfields by a newtechnology called horizontal drilling has created tremendousdemand for workers there, says Energy Service Co., which iscanvassing the area to find foremen with experience in thatspecialized process.   Finding people who can build an oil platform is just ashard as finding men to work one. When Phillips Petroleum Co.wanted to build a new platform in the Gulf of Mexico 90 milesoff Louisiana this year, it found only a handful ofexperienced companies still making them. And they were busy.The lowest bidder promised delivery next year, four monthstoo late for Phillips's schedule, says Rolf Wieborg, aPhillips offshore manager.   &quot;We ended up splitting the contract in two&quot; to speeddelivery, he says, but that cost more and now he fears risingcontractor prices will kill some other drilling projectsbefore they start.   Certain hardware is scarce, too. There are still a lot ofderricks available, but that may not mean much becausewarehouse shelves are emptying of the mundane materials thatoil people call rope, soap and dope. &quot;We've been using thatstuff up ever since the boom,&quot; says Terry Adams, an Oklahomarig worker.   &quot;The supply train is severely taxed,&quot; says Mr. Oliver ofFluor. One example: Orders for certain compressors and pumpstake from eight months to 18 months to fill. &quot;Something's gotto give,&quot; he says.   For now, it's price. At a recent Houston auction, a3,000-horsepower rig motor assembly sold for $42,000; thesame equipment sold for a quarter of that in a 1986 MorganCity, La., auction. Some drill-rig parts have soared 15-foldcompared with prices at that big Morgan City sale.   Used drill pipe that last year cost $12.50 a foot now goesfor $18.50, and new pipe would cost around $25 if it could behad. Drillers have been living on leftovers for years and nowsome veteran oil men claim there isn't enough pipe around torun 50 more rigs.   The catch is that lease rates for a rig aren't yet highenough to justify ordering new pipe -- so hardly anyone ismaking it.   Some items like that are likely to stay scarce for a longtime even if demand keeps rising. &quot;We're not going to open anew plant as fast this time,&quot; says Bennie Daricek, a 17-yearveteran with Cameron Iron Works. &quot;During the good days a manwould have to wait three years for a blowout preventer,&quot; hesays, referring to a crucial component of an oil-drillingoperation. &quot;When the bust came, people canceled three yearsof orders. We got stuck.&quot;   On the other hand, amid all the shortages there are stillsome gluts. Never-used eight-year-old mud pumps, whichlubricate drill bits, still languish in Cooper IndustriesInc.'s inventory, says Robert Cizik, chairman. &quot;I'll give youa mud pump just like that,&quot; he says, snapping his fingers.&quot;I'll give you 10. I'll give you 20. How many do you want?&quot;   John Cassidy has more than mud pumps. Probably the biggestdealer in used oil-field equipment, he still has millions ofdollars of equipment stacked up in his 160-acre yard inStroud, Okla. He bought a lot of it in the downturn for aslittle as a penny on the dollar.   For about $45,000 in 1985, Mr. Cassidy bought a derrickand platform that had cost $1 million new in the early '80s.Right now it wouldn't fetch more than $7,000 as scrap. Buthe'll wait. &quot;It's just too early to sell,&quot; he says. And thenhe grins.</TEXT></DOC>
