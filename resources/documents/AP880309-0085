Bob Dole and Vice President George Bush inWashington's Republican caucuses.   It took fewer than 10,000 foot soldiers to accomplish thevictory that eluded Robertson in his native South. Robertson'ssuccess had been predicted, since his vaunted organizationaljuggernaut works best in caucus states.   Democratic leaders projected a victory for Massachusetts Gov.Michael Dukakis, basing their assessment on bellwether Democraticprecincts. The Democratic counting could take a week, officialssaid.   Jesse Jackson ran a strong and surprisingly close second,pulling within a few percentage points of Dukakis early today.   Dukakis had been the runaway favorite going into the caucusesand carried the blessings of Gov. Booth Gardner and other stateDemocratic heavyweights. His campaign was the best organized andhad more paid staffers than all five of his competitors combined.   Uncommitted Democratic slates placed third, and Sen. Albert GoreJr. of Tennessee and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois were dueling forfourth place. Before Simon's announcement of a campaign moratoriumfor Super Tuesday states, he had been projected as the second-placefinisher.   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and former Sen. Gary Hartreceived little support.   With 4,650 GOP precinct caucuses counted, or 71 percent,Robertson led the Republicans with 39 percent, Dole had 26 percent,and Bush, the big winner in the South, was third with 24 percent.   New York Rep. Jack Kemp was a weak fourth, with 8 percent, anduncommitted slates were favored by 3 percent of the voters.   The vote tally was Robertson 5,921; Dole 3,952; Bush 3,688; Kemp1,140; and uncommitted 444.   If the proportions hold during the later two steps of nationaldelegate selection, Robertson will get 16 delegates, Dole 11, Bush10, Kemp 3 and uncommitted 1.   For the Democrats, with about 2,000 bellwether precinctsreporting, Dukakis was projected the winner with 40 percent.   Jackson, who campaigned little in Washington, had 37.5 percent,but state Democratic Chairwoman Karen Marchioro predicted Dukakiswill increase his margin when the other two-thirds of the precinctsreport.   That could take a week, she said.   Uncommitted slates were winning more than 12 percent of thevote, followed by Gore at 4.5 percent and Simon at 4.3 percent.   Gephardt had less than 2 percent. Hart, the state's favoritefour years ago, barely registered, with less than 1 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
