The cells with the new adhesives, DC 3-6527and DC Q3-6575, showed no changes in photovoltaic parameters when theywere thermal cycled from -115{sup 0}C to +125{sup 0}C through 50 cycles.Following the thermal cycling, the solar cells were irradiated with 1-MeVelectrons at fluences up to 1 x 10/sup 16/ e/cm/sup 2/. The cells usingthe new adhesives compared well with respect to the prototype VJ cellwith DC 93-500 that could not withstand thermal cycling through -80{sup0}C eclipses on the NTS-2 flight experiment. The loss in maximum powerof the VJ cells was 33.0%, 41.5%, and 42.7% for the adhesives DC 93-500,DC 3-6527, and DC Q3-6575 respectively. The maximum power loss for theplanar cells was 50.2%.</TEXT></DOC>
