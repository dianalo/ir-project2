(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Discovery's astronauts, havingconsigned the world's most sophisticated communications satelliteto its 22,300-mile-high outpost, turned their attention to scienceFriday as they whirled around Earth in their stockinged feet.   ``They are having a ball,'' said a flight director.   Back at Cape Canaveral, the redesigned booster rockets thatpowered the first post-Challenger launch toward orbit Thursday weretowed into port and, divers who inspected them said they appearedin perfect condition.   The five astronauts were quickly proving to be a quiet,businesslike crew as they looked down from their 184-mile perch atinteresting ocean currents, observed soil erosion in Mexico causedby Hurricane Gilbert, watched how solutions separate in space anddid just plain sightseeing over the blue globe below.   Conversations were confined to essentials, with little banter.But when a television link with the ground failed to work _ theantenna refused to move into usable position _ Commander FrederickH. Hauck offered to help, saying ``We'll enjoy using our mechanicaltalents.''   The antenna problem persisted but its effect on the flight wasminimal. When the same thing happened four years ago, the repairwas performed by an astronaut who was taking a spacewalk anyway. Nosuch action was contemplated on this flight.   The crew also had to contend with a temperature of 84 degrees inthe cabin, caused by a lingering malfunction in the cooling system.A cumbersome fix was available, but Hauck passed it up, saying``we're in good shape.''   ``The orbiter is great, the systems on board the orbiter aredoing quite well,'' said J. Milton Heflin, a flight director inHouston. ``We've talked about two or three problems today but, mygoodness, out of all the hardware aboard is operating just super,and I can detect that in the voices of the crew. They are having aball.''   The astronauts surprised Mission Control by playing the music of``I Heard it Through the Grapevine'' as they were eating lunch. Itwas a rejoinder to the day's wake-up call from the ground:``G-o-o-d Morning, Discovery!'' Robin Williams, who perfected hisdeejay routine in the movie, ``Good Morning Vietnam,'' prepared thetape.   In a televised science lesson from space, astronauts George D.Nelson and David C. Hilmers demonstrated an experiment involvingcell separation in weightlessness. Hilmers explained it could havemedical applications such as separating malignant fromnon-malignant cells.   In Earth's gravity, when materials like the astronauts aretesting are mixed, the lighter one tends to float to the top.Hilmers said in zero gravity it was more like a yolk floatinginside the egg white.   The crew also was asked to photograph ``some of the naturalphenomena of the planet Earth'' _ including Pacific thunderstorms,a volcano lava flow in Ethiopia and coastal erosion damage from theHurricane Gilbert on the Yucatan Peninsula.   The astronauts all have been in space before and there were noneof the gee-whiz expressions that have been a staple of the shuttleprogram.   The worrisome booster rockets that carried the shuttleflawlessly at the start of its journey, were towed into PortCanaveral, near the launch site, apparently showing no sign of theleaks that doomed the Challenger 32 months ago.   ``The divers report the boosters are in perfect condition,''said Rocky Raab, spokesman for booster manufacturer Morton Thiokol.   He said the divers, who fished the rockets from the Atlantic forinspection and refurbishment ``would see evidence if the joint wereleaking. They would see soot and the weather seals would be blownoff.''   ``There was none of that,'' he said.   Since Challenger, the boosters had undergone a major redesign toensure that the joints between segments would no longer allow hotgases to escape: a problem on nine previous flights and themalfunction that caused the space shuttle's destruction with itsloss of seven lives.   The weather seals are inch-thick blankets _ made like electricaltapes that prevent pipes from freezing _ to keep the joint sealspliable at 75 degrees.   Raab said it will be two weeks before the rocket shells aretaken apart for a minute inspection of the seals.   The 2{-ton Tracking and Data Relay Satellite released by thecrew from Discovery's cargo bay late Thursday, was in its properorbit after a journey of 22,000 miles, and Mission Control told thecrew their launch was ``with considerable precision.''   ``We're there. We're on orbit. We're very, very happy,'' said EdBangsund of Boeing, manufacturer of the rocket stage that sent thesatellite to its final orbit. The TDRS will join another on orbitsince 1983 to give NASA communications contact with future shuttles85 percent of the time.   It also will serve as an orbital switchboard for up to 24satellites, including some that will transmit coded militaryinformation.   The successful deployment was a major boost for NASA's TDRSprogram, which has had trouble from the start. The first satellitealmost didn't make it when the Boeing rocket lost its steeringability. In an almost miraculous rescue, controllers inched it toits high orbit over a two-month period by using small steeringthrusters the size of a garden hose nozzle.   In 1985, NASA removed a second TDRS from its shuttle cargoschedule for redesign because of problems with one in orbit. Thenext attempt to launch the satellite was in 1986. It was in thecargo bay of the Challenger when it exploded after launch.   NASA and the Pentagon considered the satellite so important itwas scheduled as the cargo for the first post-Challenger mission.Another is set for launch in January.   ``The launch and us getting back to space is something thatreally means a lot to me,'' Richard Truly, the NASA shuttle chiefwho supervised the post-Challenger recovery, said Friday. ``Andlooking at today's front pages, I think it means a lot to thecountry.   The second day's flight plan was deliberately conservative toenable the crew to carefully check the scores of systemmodifications made in the spacecraft since the Challengerexplosion. ``We're not breaking any new ground,'' pilot RichardCovey said before the launch.   Discovery's four-day mission is to end with a landing on thedesert runway at Edwards Air Force Base in California at 12:33 p.m.EDT on Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
