 The impact of the alliances andanswers now emerging to resolve this crisis will soon affect us all.andM;The crisis revolves around the problem of the differing imaging models usedin PCs.andP;  An imaging model is the method a PC uses to send something to anoutput device, such as a computer's display, or to a printer.andM;When one system is used to draw output on a video display and another to drawthe output of that same image on paper, discrepancies will inevitably occur.andO;In word processing or desktop publishing, for example, a line may not break(wrap) at exactly the same point on paper as it does when you see the pagedisplayed on the screen.andM;That didn't matter so much in the early days.andP;  We were very glad to getsomething--anything--on paper, even if the resemblance to what we'd seen onthe screen was only marginal.andM;Indeed, disparate imaging models were built into the IBM PC from itsinception.andP;  The text mode built into IBM's MDA (monochrome display adapter),for example, displayed letters and numbers on the screen using a characterset stored permanently in a ROM chip on the adapter board.andP;  It neither knewnor cared what the characters looked like on paper--what typefaces were usedor how big or small they were.andP;  Its only job was to put the text on thescreen in a rigid 80-character-by-25-line grid.andP;  The g's always looked thesame, the B's always looked the same, and so on.andM;That wasn't a problem back then, because the hard-copy output devices we usedusually produced equally rigid results: printouts with plain, monospacedcharacters from daisy wheel or do matrix printers.andP;  Sure, we could change toproportionally spaced output, use larger or smaller type, or even boldfaceand italicize text.andP;  But early PC software didn't support things likeproportional spacing and microjustification very well.andM;However, it did work, sort of .andP;  .  .  and besides, what else was there?andM;Then, almost six years ago, came Apple's Macintosh.andP;  Here was a computer thatshowed something like actual typefaces on the screen, and in something liketheir actual output size.andP;  Its display was crude but useful.andP;  And Apple soonfollowed up with the Laser Writer printer--the single biggest step inestablishing the Mac as a real alternative to PCs.andM;POSTSCRIPT TO THE RESCUEandM;What made the Laser Writer fly, of course, was its built-in PostScriptinterpreter.andP;  Two guys named Warnock and Geschke, who had worked on aso-called page description language while at Xerox, left to form AdobeSystems, where they created a much better one: PostScript.andM;By representing type as a set of mathematically described outlines ratherthan as traditional bitmapped characters, PostScript made it possible toscale the type up and down.andP;  This meant that a single stored g in, say, theHelvetica typeface could be reproduced in almost any size, from incrediblysmall to bigger than you'd ever want.andM;Unfortunately, PostScript's sophistication was not matched by QuickDraw, thescreen-management toolbox Apple provided in ROM in the Macintosh.andP;  So whilethe LaserWriter could generate Helvetica type in any size you wanted--say,17.5 point--you couldn't get a decent display of it on the Mac's screenunless you stored a bitmap of exactly that size in the System file, the Macequivalent of DOS.andM;Since those font-size bitmaps took up a lot of storage space, which meantthat the System file could accommodate only so many of them, users tended tostick in just a couple--say, 10-point and 12-point bitmaps for each typefacethey used.andP;  QuickDraw could produce at best only a vague representation ofcharacters in other type sizes, through a coarse extrapolation of the storedbitmaps.andM;This problem hardly held beck the growth of the Macintosh--after all, therewas always that great-looking LaserWriter output.andP;  But it did mean thatworking with text on the Mac left a lot to be desired.andP;  Page-Maker users whotried kerning large-size type--removing tiny slivers of excess space betweenT's and o's, for example--found they couldn't trust the screen display.andP;  Theywere forced to do frequent trial print runs on the LaserWriter to really seewhat they were doing.andM;DIVERGING SOLUTIONSandM;Apple wanted something better, and Adobe sensed a marketing opportunity, soDisplay PostScript appeared.andP;  It used the same font outlines as thePostScript built into the LaserWriter, and it drew them on the computer'sdisplay with amazing accuracy.andP;  Now, finally, what you saw (on a personalcomputer's screen) could truly be said to be what you got (on paper).andO;WYSIWYG forever!andM;Display PostScript did not exactly take off, however.andP;  Complaints about itsalleged performance shortcomings (it takes a lot of computer power to scalethose outlines and then push all those pixels around on-screen) and Adobe'slicense fees (outrageously high, many claimed) dragged it down.andP;  Steve Jobshas chosen it for his new NeXT computer, but otherwise, Display PostScriptremains an orphan.andP;  Because Apple rejected it.andM;Instead, Apple took a different path, announced in May this year.andP;  The newSystem 7.0 release of the Macintosh operating system, now due in the firstquarter of 1990, will contain font outlines at the system level, and thoseoutlines will be used to draw both screen-and paper-output characters.andM;Voila!andP;  Finally!andP;  A true, integral, single-imaging model!andM;Next time:  how Adobe's and Apple's technologies, and their nasty brawl, havemoved into the IBM PC world.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
