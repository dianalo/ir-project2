<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-23-0963 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Southern California Edison Company (Edison), in conjunction with theElectric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the International Lead ZincResearch Organization (ILZRO), plans to build and demonstrate a 10 MW/40MWh Battery Energy Storage Facility to determine costs and benefits ofsuch a system operating in a substation environment. The Chino 10 MWBattery Energy Storage Project represents the first major commitmentin the United States to build and demonstrate a multimegawatt batteryenergy storage system on an electric utility. The facility will be locatedat the Edison Chino Substation in the City of Chino, 50 miles east ofLos Angeles, California. The Chino battery facility has a rated capacityof 10 MW for four hours for an energy discharge capacity of 40 MWh. Thebattery system, which will be supplied by the Exide Corporation, is comprisedof 8,256 large lead-acid batteries rated at about 6 kWh each. The batterieswill be configured into eight parallel strings rated at a nominal 2000Vdc. The facility will be charged back for up to ten hours during off-peaktimes. The Power Conditioning System (PCS), being supplied by the GeneralElectric Company, is an 18-pulse, stepped-wave, Gate-Turn-Off (GTO) thyristor-basedconverter. The paper describes the current plant design and project status.In addition, siting and licensing activities for the Chino 10 MW BatteryEnergy Storage Project are reviewed. Economics of battery storage plantsare also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
