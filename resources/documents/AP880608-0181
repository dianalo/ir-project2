Reporters, including some from the Soviet Union and other Eastbloc nations, viewed missiles or missile-firing equipment at fourof the 12 sites in Western Europe covered by the missile agreement.   Soviet officials are due to begin inspecting the missile bases,plus 14 sites in the United States, as early as July 1. U.S.inspectors have a reciprocal right to check 133 sites, including126 in the Soviet Union, six in East Germany and one inCzechoslovakia.   On June 3, the Soviets invited 43 Western journalists to theSarny military base in the northern republic of Ukraine to show howtheir SS-20 missile transports and launchers will be eliminatedunder the same treaty.   The inspections are a first step toward the destruction, by1991, of all U.S. and Soviet ground-launched Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces, as called for in the INF treaty that took effectJune 1.   Lothar Ruehl, a state secretary in the West German DefenseMinistry, told a media tour of a missile site near the West Germantown of Schwaebisch Gmuend that the first of 132 Pershing 2missiles deployed in his country would be dismantled in September.The 132 Pershing 2s include 24 spares, U.S. officials said.   West Germany and Britain received the first batch of U.S.missiles in November 1983 amid widespread public protests in Europe.   Later, cruise missiles were deployed in Italy and Belgium. TheNetherlands had been designated to take 48 missiles this year butthat was canceled by the signing of the INF treaty in December.   Using unarmed Pershing 2 rockets, U.S. soldiers at the base inGermany demonstrated how the missiles will be taken apart andcrated before being shipped to the United States for finaldestruction.   The destructive power of the 50-kiloton warheads carried by thePershing 2 missiles is equivalent to 50,000 tons of TNT, or 2{times the explosive power of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.   The U.S. cruise missiles carry 200-kiloton warheads.   Reporters at the cruise missile bases in Belgium and Britainwere not allowed to see any missiles. They were shown an example ofthe metal canisters in which the rockets are stored, as well as thelaunchers and the portable trailers from which a launching would betriggered.   Reporters in Belgium also were taken to the European RepairFacility, near the city of Charleroi, where the sleek, gray-coloredcruise missiles are repaired. Several unarmed missiles were shownto reporters.   At the 485th U.S. Tactical Missile Wing near Florennes, Belgium,U.S. officials gave reporters a sample of the briefing that Sovietinspection teams are to receive before they tour the base,including diagrams of the protected bunker where 16 cruise missilesare kept.   Under terms of the INF treaty, Soviet and U.S. officials canarrive for inspections of each other's bases with as little as 16hours advance notice.   The first round of inspections, to be held between July 1 andAug. 31, will be ``base-line'' checks to verify that missiles andother items covered by the treaty are in order before dismantlingbegins.   At Greenham Common in Britain, where 101 cruise missiles arebased, U.S. officials showed reporters their preparations for thefirst inspections.   ``I'm ready for the Soviets to come now,'' said Col. William E.Jones, the base commander.   U.S. soldiers in camouflaged, eight-wheel trucks drove the55-foot long missile launchers _ minus the missiles _ along muddylanes on Greenham Common, which is about 50 miles west of London.   Once they arrive at Florennes, the Soviet inspectors will be putup in a brown-brick, two-story domitory near the center of thebase. They also will be given meals and office space on the base,officials said.   Col. Calvin Chasteen, commander of the U.S. base at Florennes,declined to say when the cruise missiles would be dismantled or howthe base would be used after the missiles were gone. The base wasopened in 1984 and much of it is still under construction.   Chasteen said ``many'' of the 1,300 U.S. soldiers at the basewould be reassigned to the United States. He did not say how many.Others would be transferred to U.S. Air Force facilities elsewherein Europe.   Guy Coeme, the Belgian defense miniter, told reporters he hopedthe missiles, which arrived at Florenne in March 1985, could bedismantled and removed by December or January. He would not be morespecific.</TEXT></DOC>
