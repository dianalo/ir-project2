Ifthe stories conjure up images of a mutinous, disaffected armyon the verge of revolt, so much the better for circulation: Arumored coup sells more newspapers than relatively dullreports about economic recovery.   Unfortunately, this sensationalism distorts events in the Philippines and may well curb any inclination to invest in the country, whether in the form of direct investment or the purchase of equities in the local stock market. This comes at a time when the ingredients are finally in place for a significant turnaround in the domestic economy. The recognition of this recovery potential has understandably fueled a sharp rally in the stock market, despite the periodic political disruptions witnessed over the past few months.    In contrast with many of its Asian counterparts, the Philippine recovery will be generated primarily from domestic, as opposed to export-related, sources. Construction activity has declined by some 75% over the past two years, and industrial-capacity utilization stands at less than 50%. Clearly the country is starting from an exceptionally low base, that will not require export-led growth for at least the next few years. Thus the prospects of increasing protectionism -- the perennial threat to the economies of Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan -- should not inhibit the short- and medium-term growth prospects in the Philippines.    The signs of a turnaround in the domestic economy are becoming increasingly apparent. After 10 consecutive quarters of decline, the Philippines began to show positive year-on-year growth in the third quarter of 1986. For the full year, growth was a marginal .18%. The volume of crude-oil imports, a good lead indicator of economic activity, rose 14% in the first eight months of the year, with industrial energy consumption rising 8.8% over the same period. Consumer price inflation has fallen dramatically from an average 1985 rate of 23.1% to .7% by the end of 1986. Indeed, over the past four months the Philippines has actually seen a negative rate of inflation.    Reserves at the Central Bank have more than trebled from $615 million at the end of 1985 to $2 billion currently. The resultant surge in domestic liquidity has pushed local interest rates down from a 1985 average of 28.6% to 15% at the moment, with the prime rate being pushed as low as 11% to 12%.    Fortunately for the government of Cory Aquino, its dramatic rise to power last February came at a propitious time. World-wide deflation, which so wracked the commodity-dependent economies of Indonesia and Malaysia in 1986, provided a windfall for the Philippines. The collapse of the international oil price, which in 1985 accounted for more than a quarter of the Philippine import bill, has substantially improved the country's current-account position, thus making it easier to move to a far more accommodative monetary policy. This is being accompanied by the dismantling of all monopolies, increased privatization of government assets and a debt-to-equity swap program. The upshot is that growth in excess of 4% in 1987 and 1988 is probable. The Aquino government itself gives 6.5% as the target in its recently published five-year plan.    All these potential achievements, of course, may well be undermined by the continuing political crises that have been well-documented by the local and international press. Three attempted coups and the seemingly endless negotiations with both the New People's Army and the Moro National Liberation Front attest to the risks confronting potential investors. There has been a tendency, however, to overstate the gravity of these problems, which should be weighed against previous political upheavals. The peso-dollar exchange rate traditionally has been an excellent barometer of investor confidence, and this rate has remained virtually unchanged for the past year. One needs only to contrast this with the 21.4% depreciation of the peso in the six weeks following the assassination of Benigno Aquino, or the 9.33% slide in the interval between last year's Feb. 18 presidential election and the subsequent revolution.    Another traditional measure of investor confidence is the stock market. Here, too, the signs are good. From a low of 160.85 on Jan. 2, the Commercial-Industrial Index surged to a three-and-a-half-year high of 607.24 in the wake of the ratification of Mrs. Aquino's constitution on Feb. 2. The mining sector, where the index more than quadrupled from 723.84 on Jan. 2 to 3703.93 on Feb. 4., tells a similar story. The rally in the latter sector was almost certainly helped by the international surge in the gold price. But the mere fact that base metal related stocks in the Philippines participated in this world-wide bull market in mining shares provides further evidence that the stock market is receiving serious consideration on the grounds of economic fundamentals as opposed to being perceived as an untouchable political basket case.    The Aquino government's appearance of drift and indecision is understandable given the disparate elements that have come together in one uneasy coalition. But the huge 77% &quot;yes&quot; vote recorded for the proposed new constitution (in which 21 million out of 25 million eligible voters participated) coupled with the unqualified support accorded Mrs. Aquino by the armed forces chief, Gen. Fidel Ramos, are two major steps toward solidifying the political foundations of this country.    This should leave President Aquino with a freer hand to cope with the &quot;two daggers&quot; pointed at the heart of her government: the insurgency and the recessionary conditions still plaguing the economy. Of course, the two are related, since 20% unemployment and 70% of the population living below the poverty line undoubtedly provide fertile ground for such movements as the New People's Army. These are problems, moreover, unlikely to disappear from the political landscape as dramatically as President Marcos did.    In an investment seminar on the Philippines last November, President Aquino gave an honest assessment of her country's problems but noted correctly that business people would not have been there &quot;trying to see the investment horizon of the Philippines had {her} predecessor been allowed to cling to power without the consent and support of {the Philippine} people.&quot; Her address vividly described the &quot;sea change&quot; in her country, and the immense opportunities for profitable investment from those &quot;perceptive enough to accept it and go by it.&quot; Judging by the boom in the stock market and the accompanying pickup in the economy, it appears the message is starting to come through.    ---   Mr. Auerback is a portfolio manager with G.T.
