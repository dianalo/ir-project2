Boeing and the Machinists union said talks that began Sept. 21and were joined by a federal mediator during the weekend endedearly Monday.   ``They said, `This is our final and best offer. This is it. It'sover,''' said Tom Baker, president of District Lodge 751 in Seattle.   Neither Baker nor Paul Binder of Boeing referred to the offer asan agreement or tentative settlement. Neither side would discloseany details, and Baker wouldn't say whether union leaders recommendacceptance or rejection.   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer today quoted unnamed sources assaying the proposed pact provides pay boosts of 4 percent in thefirst year and 3 percent in the second and third years, as well asproduction bonuses of 8 percent and 4 percent, respectively, in thefirst two years. The last contract included annual bonuses but noincrease in base wages, which determine other benefits.   The pact also contains some reduction in mandatory overtime,which is limited to 200 hours per quarter under the currentcontract, the newspaper reported.   ``We've made progress in some areas, but we're not jumping upand down,'' Baker said Monday.   Groups of workers picketed on Monday outside an administrationbuilding in Everett and at the Westin Hotel in Seattle, where thelatest talks took place.   ``The tension here is so thick that you can feel it,'' said aworker on the 767 production line in Everett. The worker, who askedthat his name not be used, said some workers marched through theplant chanting ``strike, strike, strike'' during their lunch hourMonday.   Simultaneous votes were scheduled today for the 43,300Seattle-area members of the union lodge, as well as 12,000Machinists in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and severalhundred at smaller Boeing job sites around the country, Baker said.   A simple majority is sufficient for acceptance or rejection ofthe contract, but two-thirds is required for a strike. The unionlast struck Boeing in 1977. That walkout lasted two months.   The current contract expires at midnight tonight, the same timeas the union's strike deadline.   Boeing, the world's largest commercial airplane builder, isenjoying its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders, withcarriers and leasing companies ordering 736 planes worth $38.5billion so far this year.   Though Pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business, BoeingCommercial Airplanes has a backlog of nearly 1,600 jets worth about$70 billion and deliveries extending well into the mid-1990s.   During the first part of the year, Boeing had net earnings of$356 million on sales of $9.07 billion. For 1988, profits were $614million on $16.96 billion in sales. Boeing also holds $3.66 billionin cash and short-term notes.   ``The Boeing Co. is better off than it has ever been in history,and we should be better off than we've ever been,'' Baker told arally last month.   Worldwide, Boeing employs 144,725 people, including 106,000 inWestern Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
