Manuel AntonioNoriega patrolled quiet streets today after crushing a coupattempt, and a military spokesman said two coup leaders had takenrefuge at a U.S. Army base.   A lawyer for Noriega said the general was not detained orinjured in Tuesday's uprising and had been away from the DefenseForces headquarters in Panama City when the fighting began.   It was the second failed attempt in 18 months by dissidents inthe military to oust Noriega, the Defense Forces chief and de factoleader of Panama.   Noriega was quick to blame the revolt on the United States,which has been trying to oust him for more than 1{ years and bringhim to the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges.   ``The proof is that American troops closed access routes to thebarracks, just as they closed the Pan-American Highway,'' Noriegasaid on nationwide television several hours after the failed coupby what appeared to be a small group of soldiers.   At the United Nations in New York today, Panama's president,Francisco Rodriguez, also claimed that U.S. troops blocked roadsduring the attempted coup. ``There is proof, evidence of all kindsthat there was such support which the U.S. armed forces in Panamagave,'' he told reporters. He said photographs will be releasedlater showing U.S. tanks blocking the highways.   Raul Ossa, the second vice president of the opposition ChristianDemocrats, was arrested following the coup attempt, according to atelex the party sent today to Panamanian exiles in Miami. Thestatement did not say precisely when the arrest occurred or whetherit was part of a larger roundup.   A Defense Forces spokesman, Maj. Edgardo Lopez, said two coupleaders, including Capt. Javier Licona, head of the CavalrySquadron, had taken refuge at Fort Clayton, a U.S. Army base inPanama City. In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman said he was unableto confirm Lopez's account.   President Bush denied any role in the rebellion, but hereiterated that the United States would still like to see Noriegaousted.   ``I want to see democracy in Panama succeed,'' Bush said inWashington Tuesday night. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwatersaid the Bush administration had some advance word that a coupattempt might be afoot.   Some U.S. congressional leaders said the United States shouldhave helped the rebels.   ``Once again we have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,and I think it's an outrage,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United Statesreserves the right to use force against Noriega, but he dismissed``armchair generals'' who criticized the administration's response.   Noriega was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in theUnited States in February 1988, but he maintains those charges arepart of a U.S. plot to keep possession of the Panama Canal, whichreverts to Panama at the end of the century.   He also annulled May elections after international observerssaid his slate of candidates had lost by a landslide.   The coup attempt began at the headquarters of the Defense Forcesat about 7 a.m. Tuesday, with the sound of gunshots and explosionsechoing through the poor, crowded downtown neighborhood. Police,armored personnel carriers and water cannons blocked thesurrounding streets. Some residents grabbed their belongings andran.   Sporadic shooting continued for several hours and the rebelsread a communique on national radio saying they had toppledNoriega. Loyalist troops later surrounded the headquarters compoundand more fighting broke out.   Noriega was away from headquarters at the time, said RaymondTakiff, one of several attorneys in Miami representing Noriega ondrug charges. Takiff said he spoke with Lopez today by telephonewhile Noriega stood at Lopez's side.   Coup leaders ``knew he was not (there), so why they moved is amystery,'' Takiff quoted Lopez as saying.   U.S. troops moved into position only a few hundred yards fromthe fighting and temporarily closed the main bridge over the canal,but U.S. spokesmen said those were only security measures.   The U.S. troops did not take part in the fighting.   About 50,000 Americans live in Panama, including more than12,000 U.S. military personnel attached to the U.S. SouthernCommand.   The United States never considered kidnapping Noriega, said atop Pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity.   ``When it appeared as through Noriega might have been dethroned... there were several options considered, none of which involvedgoing in and getting him.'' He declined to say exactly what optionswere weighed.   The pro-government newspaper Critica said six members of theDefense Forces died in the coup attempt. Defense Forces spokesmanLopez would say only that a number of soldiers were wounded andrefused to be more specific.   Former opposition vice presidential candidate Guillermo Fordsaid at a New York news conference that Noriega was not getting anystronger despite the crushing of the coup.   ``The mere fact that a group of officers, young officers, haveattempted to overthrow him, in my opinion, is important enough thathe must be getting the message loud and clear,'' Ford said.   Although Ford reported some civilian discontent, he alsoadmitted it was quickly put down. ``I personally believe, and I saythis with a lot of sorrow, that the Panamanian people are highlyintimidated by the regime,'' said Ford, who was beaten bloody bythugs during a demonstration after his ticket won the May 7elections.   Tuesday's coup attempt was more serious than a failed coup onMarch 16, 1988, but it appeared that only elements of the Urracabattalion, which is in charge of security at Defense Forcesheadquarters, were involved.   Although the rebel's only communique was signed by the battalioncommander, Maj. Moises Giraldi Vega, Lopez said ``more than 60''soldiers and four or five officers were being held prisoner, farless than a full battalion.   Noriega controls the country through his command of the DefenseForces, and the failure of any other units to respond to the rebelcall served to underline his control.   ``Absolutely all'' other Defense Forces officers remained loyalto Noriega, according Lopez.   That loyalty was visible in the swift reaction by the eliteBattalion 2000 and Macho de Monte units, which moved into PanamaCity to put down the uprising from bases respectively 25 and 55miles away.   At one point the rebels announced by radio that they had oustedNoriega, and a few hundred members of the civilian opposition wentinto the streets to celebrate. But within half an hour Noriegaloyalists replied that the rebels were bluffing, and the good cheerfaded.</TEXT></DOC>
