Gibbs, president and chief operating officer, said.    In the year-earlier quarter, the oil and gas producer had a loss of $9.8 million, including write-offs of oil and gas properties totaling about $11 million.    Mr. Gibbs estimated the company's per-share earnings for the latest quarter at about 10 cents to 12 cents. He said in an interview that revenue was about $9.2 million to $9.3 million, compared with $12.8 million last year. A year earlier, the oil and gas producer had operating profit of $1.2 million, or 10 cents a share.    Mr. Gibbs said cost cuts and debt-reduction moves helped first-quarter results, and that the company expects to be profitable for 1987, during which quarterly comparisons are likely to be aided by oil and gas prices rising from 1986.    Wainoco's recent offering of $22.6 million of shares and units completes efforts in recent years to cut costs and debt at the company, Mr. Gibbs said. By the end of the second quarter, he said Wainoco will have reduced its total debt to about $44 million to $46 million, from more than $78 million at the end of the first quarter.    The new funds also let Wainoco boost this year's spending on exploration and production to about $16 million from last year's $4.9 million, Mr. Gibbs said. &quot;This financing allows us to use all of our cash flow for exploration and production,&quot; Mr. Gibbs said. &quot;Now we can be an oil and gas company again, instead of just liquidating our liabilities.&quot;    The current depressed state of the exploration industry will allow Wainoco to search for new reserves at comparatively low costs, Mr. Gibbs added. </TEXT></DOC>
