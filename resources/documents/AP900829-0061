(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scores of police took up the hunt inthis terrified college town today for the ``maniac on the loose''who killed five students, mutilating three. Students armedthemselves or fled to their parents.   ``We slept with steak knives last night,'' said a tearful StacieGreen, a 19-year-old junior from Jacksonville. ``I had to call mymom. This is unreal.''   The victims _ four women and a man attending either theUniversity of Florida or Santa Fe Community College _ were stabbedin three attacks at off-campus apartments since Sunday. Police saidthree victims were mutilated. A newspaper said one was decapitated.   The killer used an open door, open window or sliding-glass doorto enter the victims' apartments, which are within about two milesof each other, Police Chief Wayland Clifton said today.   ``At first that was not real clear in our cases because wethought he might be gaining entry by disguising himself in some wayand winning the confidence of the occupants,'' he said. ``We do notnow think that that happened in any of the three cases.''   The FBI has prepared a psychological profile of the killer butauthorities do not plan to make it public, Clifton said.   Police checked out several reports of suspicious people aroundthe city overnight but made no arrests, Alachua County sheriff'sLt. Sadie Darnell said this morning.   ``It's clear this part of the country has some maniac on theloose,'' said University of Florida President John Lombardi. ``Itreminds us of a natural catastrophe. The killer is selectingvictims by criteria that are not clear to us.''   Gov. Bob Martinez ordered in dozens of state troopers and otherlaw enforcement agents. Out-of-state experts on serial killers werecalled in. Local police tripled their patrols.   ``You'll see more police coverage than you've ever seen in anycity you've ever lived in,'' Clifton said.   The buildup was scant comfort for the thousands of studentsliving off campus in the town of 90,000, where the slayings havestirred memories of serial killer Ted Bundy. He died in theelectric chair last year after murdering two Florida StateUniversity sorority sisters in Tallahassee in a 1978 rampage.   Hundreds of students bolted their doors, fled to emergencyshelters, went home to their parents or angrily demanded details onthe slayings and how to protect themselves. Many armed themselveswith pistols, stun guns and Mace.   ``My father bought me a gun,'' said a junior from Tallahasseewho refused to give her name. ``I'll stay for awhile, but I'mthinking of dropping out for a semester.''   Said one Miami father who flew into Gainesville to pick up hisdaughter: ``She's going to go back with Mace and knowing how toshoot a gun.''   Student Mark Andreozzi said he and a roommate armed themselveswhen a carpet cleaner turned up unexpectedly Tuesday. ``I had an axand he had a bat. We're going to get guns after this,'' Andreozzisaid.   The university offered lodging for students afraid to return tooff-campus apartments. Fraternity and sorority houses, churches andcommunity groups and faculty members also offered to put studentsup.   Lombardi said the university decided against canceling classbecause students who couldn't go home would be left without ``thesafety and support of the university.'' But he said all penaltiesfor non-attendance would be suspended.   Parents and friends flooded the phone lines with anxious calls,and students confronted the police chief with questions about howthe killer got in.   ``At least tell us that so we can know what we should do,'' saidKaryn James, one of more than 1,200 students who jammed the studentunion to hear the chief, school president and others explain whatprecautions to take. ``Here we are, buying all kinds of locks anddeadbolts, and we don't even know whether we should.''   Two bodies were found in one apartment on Sunday, one wasdiscovered Monday and two were found together Tuesday. TheGainesville Sun, citing unidentified sources, said one woman wasdecapitated, but authorities would not confirm that.   Slain were Tracy Inez Paules, 23, and a 23-year-old rommmate,Manuel R. Taboada. Taboada had been a student at nearby Santa FeCommunity College and was planning to study at the University ofFlorida. Ms. Paules was a senior at the university.   Also slain were University of Florida freshmen Christina Powell,17, of Jacksonville, and Sonja Larson, 18, of Deerfield Beach, and18-year-old Christa Hoyt, a Santa Fe Community College student andrecords clerk at the sheriff's office.</TEXT></DOC>
