President Bush said he would explore the offer ``to thefullest'' but that he did not want to raise the hopes of thehostages' families. Bush also refused to confirm reports he hadplanned to take military action if another hostage had been killed.One hostage was reported killed Monday.   Israel, meanwhile, was awaiting a list of prisoners that aShiite Moslem group in Lebanon wants freed.   ``I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon has solutions,the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudentsolutions,'' Rafsanjani said in a speech carried on official Tehranradio.   ``These bullyings, arrogant approaches and tyranny will notsolve the problems. Come let us approach the problem reasonably. Wetoo will help solve the problems there, so the people of the regioncan live in peace and harmony,'' he said in the broadcast monitoredin Nicosia, Cyprus.   Rafsanjani's comments were made during the weekly Friday prayersession at Tehran University.   He said if the United States wants hostages in Lebanon freed, itmust take the inititive by asking Israel to free Sheik Abdul KarimObeid, a Shiite Moslem leader abducted by Israeli commandos oneweek ago.   ``We do not make any judgment about the group which executed theAmerican colonel,'' Rafsanjani said, referring to Monday's reportedslaying of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins by the pro-IranianOrganization of the Oppressed on Earth.   ``But if the United States wants to take the inititative (infreeing hostages), it must ask Israel to free the Friday prayerleader of Jibchit,'' Rafsanjani said.   If the U.S. responds by saying it cannot pressure Israel intofreeing the Moslem cleric, ``this isn't acceptable to us,'' headded.   Israeli commandos last week stole into Jibchit, in southLebanon, and kidnapped Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslemclergyman who is the local prayer leader. Obeid also is reputed tobe a spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian group Hezbollah, believedto be the umbrella for factions holding most of the 16 foreignhostages in Lebanon.   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed it hangedHiggins in retaliation for Israel's refusal to release Obeid.Israel claims Obeid instigated attacks on Israel.   Another pro-Iranian group, the Revolutionary JusticeOrganization, threatened to kill another U.S. hostage, JosephCicippio, but announced Thursday it had suspended the death order.   It also demanded that Israel free not only Obeid but alsoPalestinian and Lebanese prisoners ``within days.'' The group didnot say if the death sentence would be restored if Israel did notcomply.   There are eight Americans among the 16 foreign hostages inLebanon. Cicippio was acting comptroller of the American Universityof Beirut when he was abducted Sept. 12, 1986. The hostage heldlongest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.   In Washington, Bush was asked if the latest developmentssuggested a break in the hostage crisis. ``I'm encouraged, but Idon't want to get the hopes of the hostages' loved ones up onceagain to have those hopes dashed,'' he said. He added that had beenengaged in ``an extroardinarily broad exercise of diplomacy'' overthe last several days on behalf of the hostages.   Had another hostage been killed, The New York Times reportedtoday that Bush planned to target for attack the Baalbek base of4,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards in eastern Lebanon. The guardswork closely with Hezbollah.   Asked about the report, Bush responded, ``If I had made such adecision, I expect this would be the last place I'd be talkingabout it.''   In Jerusalem, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel wouldexamine the new demands ``on a positive basis.'' Four top Israelileaders, including Rabin and Prime Minister Yitzkhak Shamir, mettoday in Jerusalem to fashion a response to the Shiite radicals'demands.   A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir saidIsrael was awaiting the list of prisoners the Shiites want freed.   The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was willingto transmit to Israel the demands for the prisoner release.   Israel has offered to trade Obeid, 33, and other LebaneseShiites it holds for foreign hostages and three Israeli soldiersheld in Lebanon.   Hezbollah has rejected such a swap. Sheik Na'im Qassem, aHezbollah leader, said there had been no direct or indirectnegotiations with Israel on a prisoner exchange and would not be.   The Revolutionary Justice Organization granted Cicippio areprieve 45 minutes before the deadline Thursday that it had setfor killing him.   It was the third time the group held off on its death threat.   ``Out of respect for the intervention by the parties and stateswith whom America pleaded to mediate and stop the execution, wedeclare the freezing of the death sentence and its substitutionwith an initiative,'' said a statement by the group.   None of the mediating nations was named, but press reports inBeirut have said Iran, Syria and Algeria were believed to haveinterceded. Algeria helped secure the release of American diplomatstaken captive at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979.   Rafsanjani, known as a pragmatist, has not commented on whetherIran played a role, but a knowledgeable Shiite Moslem source inBeirut, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the final word onCicippio's reprieve came from him.   Rafsanjani is believed to want to improve ties with the West andto change Iran's image as a sponsor of international terrorism.</TEXT></DOC>
