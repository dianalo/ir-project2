 Last year there were 142exhibitors contained on one floor.andP;  This year, with 275 exhibitors, the showburst onto three floors.andP;  And while two of the floors were jam-packaged withattendees drooping under the weight of all the literature and exhibitorshawking their wares, the third floor felt like an afterthought.andM;Novell's booth set the mood for the show.andP;  Immediately upon entrance to themain floor, we were assaulted by a presentation about NetWare 386.andO;Admittedly, we never stopped to listen, but we couldn't help noticing thebank of 250 PCs behind the actors.andP;  And we couldn't help pitying theexhibitors who had booths on the opposite side since they were being bathedin radiation.andM;Networld Boston shed its intimate feeling, and except for the cold weather,one could hardly tell the difference between the Boston and Dallas editions.andO;And while Comdex continues to sprawl into new hotels in Las Vegas every year,Networld may soon just give the computer industry's extravaganza a run forits money.andM;As for the exhibitors, most of the usual suspects were there.andP;  Microsoft andBanyan provided an alternative to NetWare.andP;  There were quite a few vendors ofNetBIOS-compatible network operating systems, but not nearly as many as atComdex.andP;  Digital Equipment and Data General were the representativeminicomputer companies.andP;  Apple and DCA, who exhibited at Networld Dallas, didnot show on the East Coast.andP;  Not believing in trade shows, 3Com was absent.andM;On the multiprocessor server front, Compaq was showing the SystemPro andNetFrame was showing its machine.andP;  IBM had a technology demonstration of amultiprocessor server and announced a RISC machine.andM;The many value-added resellers (VARs) present reflect the growing end-userorientation of Networld.andP;  VARs included Connolly Data Systems, LAN-Systems,NMI/Network Services, Frontline Network Systems, US Connect, and Syntrex.andM;The bulk of the exhibitors were showing platform-level networking products,such as interface cards and tape backup.andP;  And as more LANs are installed, theneed to interconnect them calls for bridges, routers, and gateways.andP;  Whilemainframe gateway vendors have always exhibited at Networld, more MAC-layerbridge and router vendors were present than in previous years.andM;LEst we give the impression that hardware was all the rage, Networld was theshowcase for many software products as well.andP;  The Lotus booth was mobbed;everyone wanted to see Notes.andP;  (It was neat.)andP;  E-mail vendors are alwaysplentiful at Networld, but more traditional applications were there,including accounting and even some MRP and medical software.andP;  We weresurprised at the large number of document managers, once an application usedalmost exclusively by law firms.andP;  Internet's NetAdvantage was recentlyintroduced.andP;  LANfolio from NMI/ Network services is based on a SQL databaseserver.andP;  A fair number of imaging servers were showing, which is also a firstfor Networld.andP;  These included Imara and MicroNet's OfficeView.andM;The proliferation of fax servers bore out the keynote speaker's claim.andP;  Inhis address, Will Zachmann of Canopus Research recapped the fables, foibles,and battles of the 1980s.andP;  The biggest breakthrough of the decade was not, assome predicted, IBM's dominance of ATandamp;T (or vice versa).andP;  Nor was it PBXsover LANs.andP;  Nor ISDN, videotext, the dnager of Ethernet collisions, nor theother 10 acclaimed breakthroughs he mentioned.andP;  It was, in short, thefacsimile.andM;Jumping ahead of the show brouhaha, on the Monday preceding the show Novellannounced support for X.400, the OSI's standard for electronic messaging.andO;For more on this important announcement, see &quot;Broadcast&quot; on page 14.andM;Isn't This Debate Over?andM;The debate over the merits of Arcnet, Ethernet, and Token Ring rages on.andO;Arcnet claims price, sufficient speed, its installed base, and its history.andO;Ethernet cites its installed base, its IEEE standardhood, and the fallacy ofthe dangers of collisions.andP;  Few have to rally around Token Ring; IBM'sendorsement is enough.andP;  From their activity at Networld, the rumors ofArchnet's and Ethernet's demise are greatly exaggerated.andM;Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) Ethernet is coming closer to reality, aswitnessed by the fast-and-furious IEEE 802.3 10Base T announcements.andP;  Vendorshave been implying (or outright claiming) compatibility with the standard forover a year, although the &quot;standard&quot; is still in draft form.andP;  When the draftbecomes a standard, it is likely that vendors will have to modify theirproducts somewhat.andM;SynOptics (Mountain View, Calif.) announced a 10Base-T version of itsLattisNet, thereby ensuring an upgrade path from its popular UTP Ethernetimplementation to the method endorsed by the IEEE.andP;  SynOptics demonstratedthe interoperability of LattisNet 10Base-T with UTP Ethernet from 3Com,Tiara, Racal-Interlan, and Western-Digital.andP;  The name of the demo LAN,ShowNet, miffed some vendors of UTP Ethernet because it wasn't really anindustry-wide interoperability demonstration; rather, it showcased a fewvendors' products.andP;  Still, the Shownet connected over 600 nodes on threefloors using the Hynes Center's existing telephone wire.andP;  A second UTPEthernet demo was organized by Networth and included products from ATandamp;T,Cabletron, SMC, and Xircom.andM;While SynOptics' products are based on 10Base-T Draft 10, Western-Digital's(Irvine, Calif.) are designed around Draft 9.andP;  WD was showing its recentlyannounced cards for the AT bus and the Micro Channel.andP;  Also on the cardfront, BICC Data Networks (Westboro, Mass.) announced a 16-bit, bus masterpotential 10BaseT-compatible card for ATs.andP;  Gateway Communications (Irvine,Calif.) also debuted UTP Ethernet, called G/EtherTwist.andM;David Systems (Sunnyvale, Calif.) announced VolsNet, the people's UTPsolution.andP;  Volksnet is not 10Base-T compatible.andP;  Targeted at groups of 6-40,this UTP Ethernet costs under $100 per port, which is much less thancompetitive offerings.andP;  David attributes the low price to the use of aproprietary ASIC.andP;  Each VolksNet hub has 12 UTP ports, an 802.3 AUI port, and28 LEDs.andP;  Western-Digital and Racal-Interlan boards work with the VolksNethub, and 3Com cards are currently being tested.andP;  VolksNet is also compatiblewith David ExpressNet, a fiber-optic and twisted-pair Ethernet LAN that willbe 10BaseT compatible.andM;On the software side of Ethernet, Cabletron (Rochester, NH) announced that inaddition to providing its Remote Lanview Ethernet management software on aHewlett-Packard OpenView platform, Lanview will also run on Sun Microsystems'SunNet Manager platform.andP;  Cabletron's support for both DOS and UNIX basednetwork management schemes is unusual.andM;Cogent data Technologies (Friday Harbor, Wash.) announced a new 16-bit busmaster Ethernet card called the E/Master-II.andP;  Based on a 32-bit LAN chip, theE/Master uses a common bus master design to accommodate ISA, EISA, and MicroChannel architectures.andP;  The card costs $895.andM;But not all activity involved Ethernet--16Mbps Token Ring is starting tobecome available.andP;  Madge Networks (San Jose, Calif.) introduced a 16/4 TokenRing adapter.andP;  When operating in the 8-bit mode,t he 16/4 AT Ringnodemaximizes performance by using memory-mapped I/O.andP;  And when operating in a16-bit computer, the card chooses bus mastering to communicate data to thehost.andP;  The new card will be available in volume in the second quarter and itsells for $995.andP;  Additionally, Madge's Smart Server Software is now availablefor both NetWare 386 and OS/2 LAN Manager.andP;  The Smart Server Software usespipelining and multiprocessing techniques to boost server performance.andO;NetWare 386 permits packets to be 4K in size, whereas NetWare 286 onlysupported 1K packets.andP;  Besides increasing the maximum packet size, the SmartServer Software also increases the rate of data transfer.andM;Madge wasn't the only Token Ring vendor.andP;  Nor was Ethernet the only source ofUTP fervor.andP;  The first multistation access unit (MAU) that allows 16/4 TokenRing networks to run over UTP was announced by Proteon (Westboro, Mass.).andO;The p7302 Workgroup Wire Center allows up to four PCs on a 16/4 Token Ring torun over UTP.andP;  The IBM MAU does not support UTP.andM;Thomas-Conrad (Austin, Tex.) announced a rack-mount version of its Smart Hub.andO;This Arcnet hub can have up to 64 ports and can be used with coax, twistedpair, or fiber optics.andP;  Each port has an LED indicating the port's status.andM;If you don't want to root through wiring closets to look at LEDs, tryStandard Microsystems' (Hauppauge, NY) new intelligent MAU and managementsoftware.andP;  Using these tools together, the network manager can display agraphical picture of the front panel of a hub and view problems from hisdesk.andP;  It's simple and it's clear.andM;Accunetics (Islandia, NY), a new LAN company composed of ex-SMC people, isnow shipping its network management system.andP;  Currently for Arcnet, theNFS-1000 allows network administrators to locate and repair network problemsfrom any workstation on a LAN.andM;The NMS-100, for example, can disconnect a faulty workstation and redirectthe data through an alternate route.andP;  The NMS-1000 is composed of theAccu-Management software and the Network Management Unit (NMU).andP;  The NMU canbe used in lieu of an Arcnet hub.andP;  The system works with NetWare.andP;  It isavailable in 16, 20, and 24 port configurations.andP;  Pricing begins at $2,495.andO;Accunetics plans on supporting Token Ring and Ethernet at a later date.andM;The SQL, Part IIandM;The hype surrounding 10BaseT is almost as bad as database servers.andP;  We'vebeen led to believe that front ends for database servers would becomeavailable almost overnight, when in reality it takes a great deal of effortto re-architect existing software around the client-server model.andP;  Front endsare just beginning to ship, and at Networld, their ranks became a bitthicker.andM;One basic problem is that SQL, entrenched in the world of minicomputer andmainframe databases, is not the most intuitive query language.andP;  And PC usersare accustomed to having their hands held.andP;  Enter SQLFile from Brightwork(Tinton Falls, NJ).andM;Through the use of menus, prompts, and function keys, SQLFile lets usersenter, maintain, and query SQL data without having to learn SQL.andP;  BefoeNetworld, SQLFile could only front for Microsoft's SQL Server, but now it canoperate with Novell's NetWare SQL.andM;In a similar vein, Ashton-Tate (Torrance, Calif.) introduced SQL Link forFramework III, a utility that enables users to bring data from SQL Serverinto the company's integrated software package.andP;  Framework III users may nowcompose queries using Transact-SQL, SQL Server's query language withextensions to SQL.andM;The data resulting from the queries may be loaded into a Framework IIIspreadsheet, database, or word processing document.andP;  SQL Link consists of twomodules: a Framework III macro and an OS/2 program that resides on theserver.andP;  The OS/2 program submits queries from Framework III to the SQLServer and returns the results to Framework III.andP;  SQL Link for Framework IIIis priced at $49.95.andP;  It requires a 3Com 3+Open 1.1 or NetWare LAN.andM;SQL Server users may now access information residing on DB2, the standard inmainframe databases.andP;  This connection is possible because of the DatabaseGateway, and OS/2-server link from Micro Decisionware (Boulder, Colo.) andMicrosoft (Redmond, Wash.).andP;  Any front end that uses SQL Server's API willwork with the Database Gateway, including Excel, DataEase, Revelation, andParadox.andM;The Database Gateway uses IBM's Advanced Program-to-Program Communications(APPC), the preferred method of peer-to-peer communications in the IBM world.andO;The Database Gateway uses the DCA/Microsoft Communications Workstationsoftware.andP;  The DCA/Microsoft Select Communications Server or the IBM EECommunications Manager may also be used as the link between SQL Server andthe mainframe.andM;The Database Gateway will be sold and supported through Micro Decisionware.andO;It will be available for $2,295.andP;  The Developers Kit costs $6,895.andP;  TheDatabase Gateway will be available in June.andM;Really Neat StuffandM;The larger LAN companies can afford to put on skits, hold raffles, give awaynice bags, and just generally attract attention because of the size of thebooth, the location and the company's name.andP;  Sometimes they also have themost interesting products.andP;  But vendors without large promotion budgets oftenhave very useful and innovative products, too.andM;PropellerHead Software (Raleigh, NC) clearly had the best name at the show.andO;They tell it like it is.andP;  But a sense of humor isn't the only thing that BenWestbrook and Ray Bayer have.andP;  They also have ArchiVista--very reliable, veryfast archiving and backup software for NetWare 386.andP;  ArchiVista can write tomultiple drives simulataneously, which makes it speedy.andP;  ArchiVista uses datacompression to speed up the archiving/backup process.andP;  And unlike someprograms, it does not store the information to disk before doing compression.andM;ArchiVista also uses distributed processing of sorts.andP;  When a user initiatesa backup or restore, he can move it to any idle workstation on the network.andO;Because of its distributed nature, ArchiVista is able to encrypt data andstill run backup devices at full speed.andM;To ensure reliability, ArchiVista writes two directory structures to everybackup tape.andP;  All backups are error-checked.andP;  ArchiVista works with streamingtapes, WORM, DAT, and other tapes.andP;  It costs $795 and operates as an NLM inNetWare 386.andM;M-Test (San Francisco, Calif.) is now shiping its Comtest LAN Analyzer.andO;Other network analyzers provide statistics about network performance, whichis a whole lot more useful to the network manager than displaying protocolinformation in hexadecimal.andP;  But M-Test has gone one step further than theother analyzers; it interprets the data.andP;  This significantly reduces the LANadministrator's learning curve.andP;  He doesn't have to spend many hours poringover printouts to figure out what the network statistics look like underordinary circumstances so that he can later recognize anomalies.andP;  Comtestspells out toubles, and thereby turns a LAN administrator into a LANtechnician.andM;The Comtest LAN Analyzer is based on a 68020 chip, which makes it fast enoughto capture and analyze 100% of the Ethernet datastream--something itscompetitors can't do.andP;  It includes a time domain reflectometer for testingthe cable an costs just under $10,000.andM;LANSim from Internetix (Dunkirk, Md.) is the only network simulator we'veseen.andP;  Most design products for baseband LANs only let an engineer work withthe cable plant.andP;  LANSim allows a network designer to simulate a networkbefore he gets around to specifying cable or servers or operating systems.andP;  Anetwork designer can model a LAN to see how various workstations and serverswill affect performance, for example.andP;  But unlike a network analyzer'ssimulation of adding nodes on a real network, testing in LANSim can't impactthe performance of a production network because it is all softwaresimulation.andP;  The baseline performance statistics come from firms that doperformance testing.andP;  Internetix is working with some protocol analyzervendors to include real-time statistics into LANSim's network modeling, andat the show, Vance (Chantilly, VA.) announced the development of an interfacebetween its ATS 100 LAN Analyzer and LANSim.andM;Internetworking FrenzyandM;As more networks are installed, more individual netorks are connected intomega-networks.andP;  And while shows like Interface and ComNet have always beenthick with bridge, router, and gateway vendors, their ranks traditionallythin at previous Networld.andP;  But from the number of internetworking vendors atNetworld, there's no doubt that the mainstream of networks are beinginterconnected.andM;Whereas last year, many Networld attendees were unfamiliar with T-1 at all,this year two companies announced bridges that work with fractional T-1.andO;Full T-1 has a bandwidth of 1.544Mbps which is too expensive or simply toomuch for the vast majority of companies.andP;  Over the past year, the telephonecompanies have begun to offer (and really push) fractional T-1, which permitsthe user o order T-1 services in chunks of 56Kbps.andP;  The telephone companyinstalls the full T-1 line to the user, and the user orders a fraction of it.andO;Then when the user needs more bandwidth, he simply orders it from thetelephone company.andM;Newport Systems Solutions (Newport Beach, Calif.) announced a fractional T-1router.andP;  Called the LAN-2LAN/FT1, this router operates in a NetWare server ora NetWare External Bridge and uses T-1 in 56Kbps increments.andP;  LANadministrators can specify any fractional T-1 speed at the four ports of aLAN2LAN/FT1 router up to its aggregate 8Mbps communications bandwidth.andP;  Listprice on a single router is $3,995.andP;  A kit which includes two routers costs$7,695.andM;Promptus Communications (Portsmouth, R.I.) wowed attendees with its T-1LANRouter, the first router for NetWare with an internal CSU/DSU (ChannelService Unit/Data Service Unit).andP;  A CSU provides the interface between theT-1 medium and the bridge or router.andP;  A DSU provides takes the data from theLAN and converts it to the proper format for transmission on the T-1 link.andO;Integrating this key element reduces the number of devices and the overallcost.andM;The LANRouter supports fractional T-1, full T-1, Switched 56 services,European CEPT (E-1) interface, and Primary Rate ISDN.andP;  LANRouter is availableas an external box or an internal card.andP;  Both available in April, the desktopmodel is priced at $6,325 and the single-slot moduel model is priced as$3,950.andM;The Fremont-Calif.andP;  based Alantec has a new T-1 interface module for itsMultilan Switch or MLS.andP;  The MLS, a MAC-layer bridge, links up to eight LANsusing fractional or full T-1.andP;  And like the Promptus router, the MLS has aninternal DSU/CSU.andP;  The Alantec T-1 Interface Module (T1IM) is also capable ofmultiplexing LAN traffic with existing T-1 voice traffic.andP;  The T1IM is pricedat $3,300.andP;  The base price for the MLS is $8,800.andM;CrossComm (Marlboro, Mass.) is no stranger to MAC-layer bridges thatinterface to T-1.andP;  At the show, CrossComm annunced  ExpertWatch, its newsupport service.andP;  Whenever there is a problem on a CrossComm ILAN bridge,alarms sound at the CrossComm Support Center.andP;  From there a CrossCommengineer can dial into the troubled network and diagnose and solve theproblem within about an hour.andP;  Once the appropriate hardware and software isinstalled, the ExpertWatch service costs $100 per ILAN bridge per month.andM;RANDOM ROAMINGandM;Enable Software (Alameda, Calif.) announced a service that synchronizes thename list databases on various Higgins electronic mail systems.andP;  The HigginsName Synchronization, as its termed, eliminates the need for manualadministration.andP;  Without HNS or similar name service, a network administratormust transmit the list of users names manually to remote sites.andP;  In an evenmore inconvenient scenario, someone would have to re-enter all those names.andO;HNS automatically synchronizes the name list database maintained at eachHiggins location.andP;  Higgins is an integrated office system of electronic mail,group scheduling, and workgroup functions.andM;Enable has also shipped a gateway between Higgins and Novell's MHS.andP;  HigginsTo:MHS allows users of any MHS e-mail system to communicate with Higginsusers.andM;Data Access (Miami, Fla.) released version 2.0 of its integrated software,called Office Works.andP;  New to the product are hot-key task switching, auser-modifiable menu, and an optional remote access package.andP;  Users can setup hot keys to access other software programs.andM;Office Works includes e-mail, an indexed filing system, a calendar withscheduling, a rolodex, and telephone messaging.andP;  A six-user license costs$495.andP;  The six-user remote package costs $695.andM;Also on the e-mail front, we got a look at Notework from ProfessionalProductivity (Brookline, Mass.).andP;  Notework may only require 5K of RAM, butthat doesn't mean limited functionality.andP;  It is RAM-resident, so users canpop it up from any application.andP;  It allows binary file attachments,forwarding with commenting, cutting and pasting from the application screen,return receipts, groups, and more.andP;  The graphics are kind of dopey.andP;  When yousend mail, the envelope gets put in a plane which flies across the screen.andO;The newe release, Version 1-0-8, can support the Notework/MHS gateway soNotework users may access all MHS applications.andP;  That means you can get intoMCI, PROFS, All-In-One and more.andP;  A two-user license costs $99; a 10-userlicense costs $399.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
