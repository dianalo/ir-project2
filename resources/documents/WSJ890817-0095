He thinks Americans make better audiences than the English. Besides that, he thinks our babies make better actors.    And he ought to know. He's just cast five un-toilet-trained Oregonians as the Christ child.    Mr. Ramsay and his troupe of actors are in Oregon this month touring with the first U.S. performance of the Lincoln Mystery Plays, traditional medieval folk dramas based on the Bible, which they normally re-enact every four years in the courtyard of England's Lincoln Cathedral.    The adult actors from Lincoln play parts from Adam to Zelome, but in each of the five Oregon cities to which they've traveled, an important but non-speaking role had to be filled by a local actor. Any baby would do to play Jesus in most of the towns, but in Eugene perfection was sought by holding public auditions at a local theater.    The Jesus auditions brought out five mothers who thought their babies would be just divine in the role. There were even three girls among the tryouts, the reasoning being that with a bald, six-month-old baby, Pampers cover up a multitude of problems.    Free-lance director Joseph Gilg took on the task of choosing Jesus. God-like was not one of the attributes he required, but he did insist on even temperament.    &quot;I don't think we'd want a cranky Jesus,&quot; said Mr. Gilg. &quot;It would give a wrong twist to the story.&quot;    One by one, Mr. Gilg peered into the cherubic faces, then watched as the babies were tested by being put in the arms of a strange woman while their mothers walked away. Siblings, grandparents and neighbors held their breath, fearful that a wail would mean curtains for an infant's theatrical aspirations.    A would-be Jesus named Chelsey was very cranky just before her name was called but, miraculously, she was able to burp all over her father's shirt in the nick of time. Her suddenly happy disposition won her the position of understudy.    When it came to naming Jesus, Mr. Gilg was cautious.    &quot;If you're going to live and die by my decision,&quot; he told the mothers, &quot;I'd rather you leave now.&quot;    It was pure coincidence that the director's name was Joseph, but the mother of the baby chosen by Mr. Gilg seemed to think that her name had given her boy a leg up on the competition.    When Daniel McCormick's name was announced, his mother cried out, &quot;And my name is Mary]&quot;    Next, the Lincoln Mystery Players journeyed to Bend, in central Oregon, where the first production of their tour was staged. Next to a duck pond in Drake Park, they took an appreciative audience from Creation to doomsday.    The company performed short, verse plays from a 1468 manuscript, the very plays seen by residents of Lincoln in the 16th century, before they were outlawed during the Reformation. In those early days, the plays were presented by working people on religious festival days to help reinforce the faith of a largely illiterate populace.    Mr. Ramsay, the director of the company, is director of the drama department at Bishop Grosseteste College in Lincoln. In 1978 he revived the mystery plays, known as the Lincoln cycle, and drew together a troupe of amateur and professional actors who have performed the plays in France, Italy and Germany.    Brought to the U.S. by the Oregon Committee for the Humanities, the players selected 13 of the cycle's 42 plays to perform for the Oregon audiences. The baby Jesus appears in two of the plays, &quot;Birth of Christ&quot; and &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds.&quot;    In Bend, the baby Jesus there had not auditioned, mind you, but he played the part like a natural. When he was first carried on stage, a young voice in the crowd exclaimed, &quot;It's a live one]&quot;    Far from being a cranky Jesus, this one cooed beatifically, even while being passed back and forth between Joseph and Mary, chucked under the chin by Salome and Zelome (Mary's midwives), and kissed by a number of shepherds.    At intermission Mr. Ramsay was ecstatic. The audience was fantastic, he said. Unlike the more reserved audiences in England, the people of Bend laughed in all the right places, and even booed and hissed at King Herod, the bad guy. As for Jesus, what a baby]    &quot;He's the best baby Jesus we've ever had,&quot; stated Stephen Hartford, who played the grownup Jesus.    But that was before he'd seen the performance of the baby Jesus from Pendleton or Ashland or Portland, or even that very special baby Jesus from Eugene, the winner of the audition.    You know. Mary's kid.    ---   Ms. Hauser is a free-lance writer based in Portland, Ore. </TEXT></DOC>
