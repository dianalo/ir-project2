WHITING</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States is consideringdirect contacts with Cambodia's communist government in addition toVietnam to try to end the war in Cambodia, Secretary of State JamesA. Baker said today.   Baker said the withdrawal last year of Vietnamese troops backingthe Cambodian government ``gives us cause to see whether Hanoi isnow prepared to support a process of political reconciliation''that would lead to free elections.   ``We are also considering contacts with the Phnom Penh regime,''he added.   The moves would fit in both with efforts to reduce East-Westtensions and with continuing U.S. support for the non-CommunistCambodian rebels, Baker said in a speech to the Association ofSoutheast Asian nations, or ASEAN.   He spoke on the first day of a three-day meeting of the group,which comprises Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines,Brunei and Indonesia. The foreign ministers of Australia, Canada,the European Community, Japan, New Zealand are also attending thesession.   ASEAN foreign ministers criticized Baker's announcement lastweek that the United States would not recognize the United Nationsdelegate from the three-part Cambodian resistance because itincludes the Communist Khmer Rouge.   During Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia from 1975-78, hundreds ofthousands of Cambodians died from starvation or executions whilethe government enforced a radical program to collectivizeagriculture.   Vietnam invaded in 1978 and toppled the Khmer Rouge led by PolPot, but the rebels have staged a string of recent battlefieldvictories and are the strongest anti-government force.   Baker arrived in Jakarta Thursday on the first leg of afour-nation Asian tour. He assured ASEAN that their goals and thoseof the United States were not contradictory.   ``Our common approach to Cambodia has _ for a decade _ focusedon three goals: a verified withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, theprevention of the return to power of the Khmer Rouge, and genuineself-determination for the Cambodian people through freeelections,'' he said.   The guerrilla resistance was formed under ASEAN sponsorship in1982 with U.S. support. The Khmer Rouge is by far its most powerfulcomponent.   ``Continued support for the coalition at the U.N. is onlyproviding the Khmer Rouge diplomatic cover for its militarymaneuvers,'' Baker said.   Baker also noted that Washington is expanding its military tieswith Singapore, which offered expanded use of its facilities toU.S. warships and planes last year. Baker is due to visit Singaporeon Sunday on the next stop of his trip, which also includesMongolia and talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.Shevardnadze in Siberia.   On the issue of refugees arriving from Indochina, Baker said theUnited States had met its commitments and that its critics wereindulging in finger-pointing.   ASEAN warned Tuesday that it reserved the right to turn awayboat people. The warning was aimed at pressuring Washington to endits opposition to the compulsory return of boat people who arefound to be fleeing for economic reasons, rather than because ofpolitical persecution.   More than 130,000 boat people are held in camps in the region.Refusal by the United States and Vietnam to accept mandatoryrepatriation led to postponement of an international conference onthe problem in Geneva earlier this month.</TEXT></DOC>
