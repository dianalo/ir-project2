In the latest move, Fidelity Brokerage Services Inc.raised its commission rates 10% -- its first general priceboost in four years -- even as it launched a new computertrading package for small investors.</LP><TEXT>   The brokerage unit of Fidelity Investments, the nation'sbiggest mutual fund company, is the last of the three largestdiscount brokers to raise prices in the past year. Discountbrokers, unlike full-service Wall Street brokerage houses,charge cut-rate commission rates because they don't offerinvestment advice.   The Fidelity move, disclosed in a letter to customers,became effective Feb. 1. &quot;We're like everyone else on theStreet -- we face rising costs&quot; that have to be passed alongto investors, said Lawrence H. Armstrong, a Fidelityexecutive vice president. In the letter, Fidelity saidinvestors will pay about $7.75 more on an average trade of$5,000.   Mr. Armstrong asserts that Fidelity typically doesn't getcomplaints when rates are raised. &quot;Most of our business comesfrom people from full-service firms,&quot; where costs still arefar higher, he said.   With the 10% increase, the average commission on 100shares of a $30 stock at Fidelity Brokerage now is $54. Thiscompares with $55 at Charles Schwab Corp., the nation'sbiggest discount brokerage firm, and $49 at Quick andamp; ReillyGroup Inc., the No. 3 discounter. The commission for asimilar trade at full-commission brokerage firms typically is$80 or more. Rates at so-called deep discounters can run aslittle as half that of big discounters.   Schwab, which last raised its rates in May, said it has noplans to hike rates further. Nor does Quick andamp; Reilly, whichlast raised its rates in March. With profits surging already,&quot;We don't want to stir the pot,&quot; said Thomas C. Quick,president of Quick andamp; Reilly's brokerage operations.   With Fidelity's recent hike, &quot;I think we're priced right,&quot;Mr. Armstrong said. He added that the firm's goal &quot;isn't tobecome a low-price provider,&quot; but to &quot;stay ahead of the curveon technology.&quot;   Indeed, Fidelity last week launched a computer-basedtrading package for investors for easier access to stock andfund prices, among other things. With a personal computer,small investors can use the new system, dubbed FidelityOn-line Xpress, to trade directly with financial markets.Customers using the program, which costs $120, will get a 10%discount off Fidelity's commission rates.   The new system, an update on a computer trading systemFidelity first launched in 1984, allows investors to getimmediate quotes on stocks, options, mutual funds, bonds andmarket indicator. Access to financial news and informationfrom Dow Jones News/Retrieval, as well as other research andanalytical services, is available for an additional fee,Fidelity says. (Dow Jones News/Retrieval is owned by DowJones andamp; Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal.)   Separately, Fidelity said it soon will launch an automatedtelephone trading service. Using a touch-tone phone,investors can trade listed and over-the-counter stocks andmutual funds in a Fidelity brokerage account, for a 10%commission discount.</TEXT></DOC>
