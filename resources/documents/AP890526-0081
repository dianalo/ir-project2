With the North Atlantic Treaty Organization embroiled in a majordispute about nuclear weapons policy, The Washington Times reportedthat Bush planned to use the summit as the stage for announcing areduction of up to 10 percent in U.S. troop strength in Europe,``as many as 34,000 troops.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters aboard AirForce One en route to Rome: ``Any ideas in this area would be onethe president would want to discuss with the allies, he would raisewith his partners at this session before he discusses anythingpublicly ... I am not confirming or denying any decisions.''   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. SamNunn, D-Ga., told CBS News in Washington that a 10 percentreduction ``is the probable amount of reduction that would occur ifthe Soviet Union accepted the NATO proposal on conventional armscontrol which is now tabled.''   A senior NATO official, asked by reporters in Brussels about thereport, said ``our delegations here on the spot have not beenapprised of this.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.   West German government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling said inBonn, ``We have no official word of such a decision.'' Some 250,000U.S. troops are stationed in West Germany.   In his departure remarks, Bush provided no hint of a significantAmerican counter to recent Soviet arms proposals. He said, ``Theimportance of the alliance and its democratic underpinnings is themessage I now take to Europe.''   Bush, upon arriving at the first stop of his trip in Rome notedthat, ``Since ancient times, the saying goes, ``All roads lead toRome'' and it's still true. It is fitting that here I begin myfirst trip to Europe as president of the United States.''   Bush praised U.S.-Italy ties of friendship and said ``The UnitedStates welcomes a stronger and more united Europe.'' He said heplans to be ``actively engaged in Eastern Europe, promotingmeasures to encourage political and economic liberlization inPoland.''   In his departure remarks at Andrews Air Force Base outsideWashington, the president said, ``NATO has been a success by anymeasure but success breeds its own challenges. Today, dramaticchanges are taking place in Europe, East and West. For us, thosechanges bring new challenges and unparalleled opportunities.''   Bush expressed hopes to see a Europe ``that is truly free,united and at peace'' and repeated his desire to move beyond theCold War policy of containment ``to integrate the Soviet Union intothe community of nations.''   Bush added: ``We welcome the political and economicliberalization that has taken place so far in the Soviet Union andin some countries of Eastern Europe. We watch hoping that morechanges will follow.''   In Rome, the president planned a two-night stay and talks withPope John Paul II as well as with Italian leaders.   Manfred Woerner, who is NATO's chief executive, said failure tosettle a dispute over nuclear weapons would be ``a ratherunfortunate situation but it would not be a crisis or acatastrophe.''   Amid growing doubts in Washington that a settlement was near,Woerner said in Brussels he would like the allies to reach anagreement ``and avoid the impression of being split in an importantmatter.''   Setting the stage for the NATO meeting, Bush will deliver aspeech Sunday at an American cemetery in Nettuno, on Italy'sseacoast 39 miles south of the capital. Later Sunday, the presidentwill arrive in Brussels where leaders of the 16-nation alliancewill begin two days of formal talks on Monday. From Brussels, Bushwill go to West Germany and Britain.   The summit, called to mark NATO's 40th anniversary and itssuccess in keeping the peace in Europe, was thrown off track inadvance by a dispute over short-range nuclear missiles in centralEurope.   The chief players in the argument are West Germany, which isdemanding East-West negotiations soon to curb the missiles, and theUnited States and Britain, which oppose such talks as long as theSoviet Union maintains a major advantage in ground troops, tanksand other conventional weapons.   The missiles, with a range of less than 300 miles, are largelydeployed in West Germany and would be used there in the case of war.   The Bonn-Washington dispute is aggravated by a tide ofdisarmament sentiment in West Germany, fanned by Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev's promises to reduce conventional and nuclearforces.   On the eve of his departure, Bush received a message from WestGerman Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the latest in a series of proposalsand counterproposals. However, the White House said the two sidesremained at an impasse.   ``Our attitude from the beginning has been that we would like toreach an agreement on this before the summit, but if not, we'lldiscuss it there,'' said Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater.``If it's not resolved there, we'll discuss it in follow-onconsultations.''   Emphasizing that the dispute will not shake the foundations ofNATO, Fitzwater said, ``We don't believe it will overwhelm ordominate the summit and it should not and will not be allowed to.''   In Brussels, Woerner said, ``This alliance has lived withdifferences of opinion all through its very successful lifetime,and if this question is not solved today it will be solvedtomorrow.''   The West German government also is resisting a jointU.S.-British effort to more than triple the range of Lance missilesto just below 300 miles. However, a decision on modernizing theweapons has been put off until 1992.   Bush's trip, his first to Europe as president, is seen as animportant step as he tries to establish himself as a worldstatesman and attempts to counter Gorbachev's success in projectinghimself as a peacemaker.   ``It's nothing new that a new president faces a test fromMoscow,'' said Burton Pines, senior vice president and director ofresearch at the Heritage Foundation. ``The first test of Bush isnot coming from Moscow. It's Bonn which is testing the newpresident.''</TEXT></DOC>
