The battle now shifts to the House, where the Baby Bellsare expected to run into more resistance.</LP><TEXT>   The legislation would permit the regional phone companies,which were created in the 1984 breakup of American Telephoneandamp; Telegraph Co., to manufacture telecommunications equipmentranging from phones for the home to sophisticated switchinggear.   The Bells have said that the bill would give them moreflexibility to conduct research and to design equipment fortheir networks and for their customers. They say it alsowould permit them to form joint ventures with establishedmanufacturers. Eventually, the Bells foresee a day when theycould become full-fledged manufacturers, competing with theirformer parent, ATandamp;T, as well as with other big equipmentmakers.   ATandamp;T, smaller makers of telecommunications gear, consumergroups and some state regulators opposed the bill, arguingthat the Bell concerns could use their monopoly phonecompanies to subsidize new ventures, boosting costs to phonecustomers while undercutting competition.   The bill would require the Baby Bells to conductmanufacturing operations through separate subsidiaries. Inaddition, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), chairman of theJudiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, and panelmember Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.) managed to negotiateamendments to require the Bells to pay for annual,independent audits of their manufacturing subsidiaries andother affiliates that have transactions with them.   The audits would be directed by state regulators, and theFederal Communications Commission could examine the Bells'books and records to verify the audits. States also would getauthority to review books and records of out-of-statemanufacturing operations.   The administration opposes the bill because it contains a&quot;domestic content&quot; provision, requiring that final assemblyof Bell products take place in the U.S. and that the value offoreign parts in Bell-manufactured goods equal no more than40% of the total revenue of the manufacturing subsidiaries. Aproposal to drop the domestic content provision was defeated6432.   The domestic-content provision was the result of acompromise between the Baby Bells and their biggest union,the Communications Workers of America. The companies, whichwould have preferred to have no restrictions onmanufacturing, were nevertheless loath to jettison theprovision, especially as they head into talks on contractsthat expire next year.   Currently, the Bells are barred from making telephoneequipment under the consent decree that broke up the BellSystem. The decree also stipulates that the Bells can'tprovide long-distance service or own the content ofinformation services transmitted over their networks.   On Capitol Hill, the bill was widely viewed as a victoryfor its author, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D., S.C.), thechairman of the Commerce Committee. Sen. Hollings framed thedebate as a battle between the Baby Bells, which he said holdthe promise of helping U.S. competitiveness, and ATandamp;T, whichhe argued merely wants to keep competitors out of theestimated $110 billion world-wide telecommunicationsequipment and software market.   Sen. Hollings emphasized that an increasing number offoreign companies have either set up shop in the U.S. or areselling more and more telecommunications equipment here. &quot;Weare being invaded like fleas on a dog,&quot; he complained.   The vote was a major defeat for ATandamp;T, which wasn't able tomatch the lobbying clout of the regional Bells. &quot;This billsailed through the Senate with cursory public hearings andlittle floor debate,&quot; an ATandamp;T spokesman said. &quot;We are goingto press vigorously in the House for greater scrutiny.&quot;   Several senators had considered introducing otheramendments that would have weakened the Bells' position, butsupport seemed to wither after Sen. Hollings promised a nastyfloor fight.   The Bells were pleased. Ronald Stowe, head of PacificTelesis Group's Washington office and chairman of a Baby Belltask force set up to lift consent-decree restrictions, calledthe vote &quot;a major step forward for American consumers,workers and the American economy.&quot; For years, the Baby Bellshave sold telephones and other equipment under their brandnames, but those products have been made by other companies.   Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the ConsumerFederation of America and a strong opponent of the Bells'efforts to win freedom from consent-decree restrictions, saidhe was &quot;very disappointed.&quot; He argued that the bill wouldlead to higher local phone rates because the Bells will tryto maximize profits by buying their own equipment. &quot;The billis anti-consumer, anti-competitive and horrible publicpolicy,&quot; he said. &quot;We hope the House will do a more carefuljob.&quot;   A similar bill was introduced in the House earlier thisspring. But it appears to be stalled since Rep. Edward Markey(D., Mass.) chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee,has been pushing for more comprehensive legislation. Draftlegislation from his staff would introduce &quot;genericsafeguards&quot; aimed at preventing anti-competitive behavior inthe event the Bells win freedom to enter other restrictedbusinesses.   The Senate vote came in the early evening, after the stockmarket had closed. Besides San Francisco-based PacificTelesis, the Baby Bells include: Ameritech Corp., Chicago:Bell Atlantic Corp., Philadelphia; BellSouth Corp, Atlanta;Nynex Corp., White Plains, N.Y.; Southwestern Bell Corp., St.Louis; and U S West Inc., Denver.</TEXT></DOC>
