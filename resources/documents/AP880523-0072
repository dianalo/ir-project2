On Sunday about 250 people gathered outside Saragosa's cemeteryto hear Bishop Raymundo Pena's memorial Mass to mark the firstanniversary of the tornado that killed 30 people and injured 170others.   Standing under a cloudless sky, Pena urged the survivors tothank God for the strength ``to bear our cross and to rebuild, notonly our town, but also as we begin to rebuild our lives.''   The physical rebuilding of the Mexican-American community isalmost complete. The tornado destroyed more than 60 houses, and theRed Cross, Texas Department of Community Affairs and Catholicdiocese rebuilt most of them.   After Mass, Pena walked around town and blessed all the houses.   Among the structures destroyed by the tornado was the communitycenter, which was filled at the time with friends and relativesattending a preschool graduation ceremony. Many of the victims _some of them not even of school age _ died in the communitycenter's rubble. The new center will house 300 in its basementtornado shelter.   Also reduced to rubble was the church, whose brown brickreplacement is scheduled for completion in late June.   The new church, which will seat 276 in its sanctuary, will bedesignated a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe. It will be thefirst such shrine in the El Paso diocese, Pena said.   The Catholic Church, Pena said, also has allocated more than$300,000 for counseling services over five years to help survivorsrecover from the tragedy.   ``Psychologists tell us it takes five years for people torecover from a trauma of this type,'' the bishop said. ``Theslightest little wind causes much fear in some people.''   Some Saragosans said they wanted to reiterate a messagecontained on a sign put up recently on the south edge of town bythe side of Highway 17: ``Thank you, America, for helping rebuildSaragosa.''   ``We're all very happy,'' said Julian Olivas, 34, of Saragosa.``We thank people who helped us in one way or another. It's just alittle town; it wasn't even on the map. Now we have a lot ofpublicity everywhere.''</TEXT></DOC>
