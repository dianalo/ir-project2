AlphaGraphics Printshops of the Future, a Tucson, Ariz., print and copy shop operator, said it plans to license two locations in Moscow this winter -- at the Expo Center and on Gorky Street.    &quot;There are no quick-printers as we know them in the U.S.S.R.,&quot; said Rodger Ford, president and founder of AlphaGraphics, a franchiser of more than 250 printing outlets in several countries.    Until the new policy of openness or &quot;glasnost,&quot; Soviet law prohibited commercial printing or photocopying of any document without a censor's permit, he said.    The Soviet State Committee of the Printing and Publishing Industry will own 51% of the venture, with the remainder owned by Phargo Management and Consulting Ltd. of Toronto.    Copies will cost as much as 25 cents each and the venture is designed to generate hard currency. Only 20% of the business would be conducted in rubles, the rest in dollars, which means the quickshops may come in handy mostly to foreign businessmen, press and Soviet government agencies. Converting rubles into dollars is restricted in the country. &quot;Most complicated part of the joint venture is non-convertibility of rubles,&quot; said Mikhail Volodarsky, a State Committee official who appeared at a news conference here.    Mr. Volodarsky insisted that anyone off the street could walk in and get photocopies made of documents, circulars or unpublished materials. &quot;Absolutely,&quot; he said. Even questionable documents? &quot;I guess so,&quot; he said.    Stephen Stanovich, a Soviet expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said glasnost has created &quot;more room&quot; for printing and publishing materials without much scrutiny. But he said it was likely &quot;a record would be made of what was copied.&quot;    At the news conference, Mr. Volodarsky denied records of copies would be kept.    Reading from the new official Soviet publication &quot;New Business Opportunities -- Guide for Businessmen and Managers,&quot; Mr. Volodarsky said the quick-copy venture is &quot;completely in line&quot; with the new glasnost policies. He called it &quot;one of the most privileged projects&quot; and said state authorities had instructed him to &quot;go much faster than we usually do&quot; in approving foreign ventures into the country.    The two stores will be electronically linked with other AlphaGraphics shops, allowing state-of-the-art transmission of texts and pictures via phone links. The documents won't be subject to censorship, the officials said.    But an ordinary Soviet citizen still might feel subject to scrutiny. The joint-venture will be run by a Soviet. It will employ only two Americans, and the remaining work force will consist of 16 Soviets. </TEXT></DOC>
