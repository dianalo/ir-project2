(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Globalization.andP;  It became everybody's favorite word about the time thatcompanies in Europe and Asia began to get the better of American companies ineverything from sporty convertibles to DRAMS.andP;  These days, no company -especially in the computer-related industries we follow - can survive longwithout a global strategy.andP;  It follows that investors must start thinkingglobally too, and increasingly in 1989 that's what they did.andM;Not that many American venture capitalists were prowling abroad for deals,although some were.andP;  Even Kleiner Perkins Caufield andamp; Byers, thequintessential Silicon Valley investor, made its first foreign investment.andO;But venture capitalists more and more were helping their portfolio companiesto start foreign operations, to attract corporate partners from overseas, orto tap the pools of risk capital that seem to be growing faster elsewherethan at home.andP;  That caused some partnerships to establish closer ties withtheir counterparts abroad, a trend that seems likely to intensify.andM;It is all part of a maturing process that's taking place as the glamour phaseof venture capital comes to an end.andP;  Those heady days of building majorcompanies and taking them public within a year or two won't be back soon.andO;Funds flowing to venture capitalists declined again last year, probably toless than $2.5 billion.andP;  With the market for initial public offerings only ashadow of its former self, the search is on for new investment vehicles andexit strategies.andM;Management buyouts and outright acquisitions gained favor last year, even inindustries as unlikely as semiconductor equipment.andP;  Seed investments seemedto decline in popularity as middle-stage bargains multiplied.andP;  But through itaU, our surveys indicate, the level of venture investment in computer-relatedcompanies held remarkably steady.andP;  This may come as a surprise to those whohave heard our cries recently.andP;  Based on the results of our last twoquarterly surveys, we worried a bit about a decline in venture interest inour favorite industry.andP;  Such a development wouldn't be surprising, given thedifficulty in raising venture funds and the lure of diversification.andP;  But anyfears of mortal illness, it turns out, were premature.andM;Census problemsandM;Surveys, we can attest after five years of conducting them, are temperamentaltools.andP;  The least thing can throw them off.andP;  In the case of our quarterlyventure capital surveys, multiple closings or last-minute delays can shift adeal reported in one quarter into another.andP;  Respondents may differ in theirinterpretation of deal stages, valuations, or even industry classifications.andO;Some, in spite of the enormous cash prizes we offer for filling out the formson time, may occasionally miss our deadlines.andP;  We think our surveys are thebest available barometers of private investment activity in thecomputer-related industries.andP;  Perfectly accurate, they aren't.andM;We keep trying to improve them, and in that spirit have gone to some troubleto double check the investments reported by our venture capital respondentslast year with the portfolio companies that got the money.andP;  We plan to keepdoing this follow up to make sure that the annual numbers are as accurate aswe can make them.andP;  The revised numbers, along with listings of deals andinvestors and a good bit of statistical analysis, are presented in our new100-page book - Computer Letter's 1989 Venture Capital Report - whichsubscribers will receive in the next week or two.andM;Call off the wakeandM;It turns out that 1989 wasn't a bad vintage at all.andP;  In fact, the total of$1.24 billion that went into computer-related companies was not much lowerthan the previous record of $1.26 billion we recorded in 1988.andP;  We weren'tkeeping score in the early 1980s, when the numbers were briefly - evenhigher).andP;  We counted 447 deals last year, up from 420 in 1988 and anotherrecord.andP;  That meant, of course, that the average deal was smaller - $2.8million versus $3 million in 1988 and $3.1 million in 1987.andP;  As the chart onPage Two indicates, quarterly investments showed only a slight declinethrough the year.andP;  After an unusually strong first quarter, when $362 millionwas invested, the flow of money flattened out at around $300 million perquarter.andP;  That is a bit below average for the spring and summer quarters butstronger than usual in the final period.andM;State of mindandM;Once again, computer-related investing was heavily concentrated on one state- California.andP;  Of the 447 deals we counted, 252 or 56.4% involve Californiacompanies, up from 53.8% in 1988.andP;  This despite the fact that regionalventure funds seem to be doing well.andP;  Three Colorado funds raised acollective total of almost $150 million last year, and Cleveland'sMorgenthaler Ventures closed on $50 million of a planned $100 million fund.andO;The money goes where the opportunities are, however.andP;  Wind Point Partners,the biggest venture fund in Wisconsin, tries to invest within a two-hourplane ride.andP;  That describes a lot of territory between Boston and SanFrancisco.andM;More on the lineandM;Almost exactly a quarter of the money - $304 million - went to companiesdeveloping communications products.andP;  The year-to-year increase of 53% madecommunications the hottest target for venture capital investing last year, asthe chart on Page Four illustrates.andP;  Software and services, which dropped 23%to $208 million, fell to second place in the popularity rankings.andP;  Venturesupport for computer systems, peripherals, and integrated circuits eroded,but computer subsystems, healthcare systems, and communications services allgained favor.andP;  The bias toward communications shows up also in our annualranking of deals by dollar amount and post-financing valuation.andP;  Three of thefive largest deals involved communications companies.andP;  Echelon Systems, thecomeback vehicle for Ken Oshman and Mike Markkula, raised a first round of$25 million from a dozen investors to lead the pack in dollar terms, and itsvaluation of $55 million ranked ninth.andP;  integrated Network had the topvaluation of $1 10 million.andM;Catching a later stageandM;The Echelon financing helped keep first-round deals at a healthy 15% ofventure activity in a climate that otherwise didn't favor early-stageinvesting.andP;  Hambro International Venture Fund is just one example of a firmthat has moved its early-stage exposure from virtually 100% in the early1980s to about 50% today.andP;  And 3i Ventures, which still likes to do seed andstartup investing, finds it difficult now to find syndication partners forsuch deals.andP;  Our numbers bear out that concern.andP;  Only 33 seed financings,totaling $62 million, were done last year, down from a peak of 41 dealstotaling $69 million in 1988.andP;  Later-stage financings, that is roundsreported as fourth, fifth, bridge, mezzanine and later, also declined.andO;Middle-stage deals - second and third rounds - soared in popularity aspricing for more mature companies declined and investors who normally mightgo in early decided to wait.andM;Ready , fire., aimandM;This may not, however, be cause for alarm.andP;  Many funds still earmark moneyfor early-stage investments, which are made whenever opportunities appear.andO;Mayfield Fund, among others, has responded to increased competition by movingmore than ever to seed deals.andP;  Of the 14 new companies in which Mayfieldinvested last year, half were so embryonic they lacked presidents.andM;Seed opportunities are hard to predict, and even a carefully-crafted strategyis likely to be ignored if the right deal comes along.andP;  For example,Crosspoint Venture Partners, a seed specialist, had decided not to put anymore money into computer, rotating memory, or tape drive companies.andP;  Yet itfunded Adaptive Systems, a neurocomputer startup; Visqus, which is developinga new magnetic recording technology; and LaserTape, an optical tapespecialist (a deal that closed in the first quarter of 1990).andP;  If moreintriguing deals come along this year, we think startup fundings will riseagain.andM;Anyone feel a draft?andM;Still, the allure of the mature company increases with every year that theIPO market remains in intensive care.andP;  Yes, the window opened a bit widerlast year, helping some portfolios toward real liquidity.andP;  Successfulofferings by MIPS Computer Systems, Verifone, and Electronic Arts brought to19 the number of Kleiner Perkins III (raised in 1983) portfolio companiesthat have gone public or been acquired.andM;By most standards, that is a reasonable record for a portfolio of 40investments.andP;  Industry veteran Bob Pavey of Morgenthaler Ventures, who isalso the new president of the National Venture Capital Association, views thepresent low-key IPO market as a lot more  normal&quot; than the go-go era of theearly 1980s.andM;Matchmaker,  matchmakerandM;The fact remains that the new market realities call for new investmentstrategies.andP;  If one is to invest early at a low price and raise new equitylater at a higher price, one must think not only of a possible IPO but alsoof a company's attractiveness to corporate partners.andP;  It may also benecessary to think smaller than the $100 million target that became the brassring for many an investor when high-multiple offerings were in vogue, for fewcompanies ever get capitalized at over $100 million.andM;Smaller is, in fact, becoming more popular.andP;  Not only is the average dealsize declining but valuations moderated last year as well.andP;  The top 100valuations in 1989 averaged $27.8 million, down from $32.5 million the yearbefore.andP;  The risks inherent in a lofty capitalization became starkly apparentlast year when Stellar Computer and Ardent Computer, whose combinedvaluations in 1988 totaled $283 million, decided to merge.andP;  In its lastventure round before the merger, Stellar was valued at just $75 million.andM;An LBO by any other nameandM;The search for alternative strategies is leading more investors to buyouts ofone form or another, which now account for perhaps 20% of venture capitalactivity.andP;  (Most of these deals don't show up in our surveys because theyhave usually been done outside of the technology industries.) We're nottalking about the highly leveraged buyouts that seem to have fallen fromgrace along with the junk bonds that made them possible.andP;  Rather, venturecapitalists are doing what some of them call venture buyouts, which stressgrowth rather than debt service.andM;The buyout approach is being tested in computers Prime Computer), enhancementproducts (SuperMac Technology), semiconductors Microchip Technology), andsemiconductor equipment (Tegal, Tylan, and Veeco instrument).andP;  Some old-linetechnology investors are involved - J. H. Whitney, Sutter Hill, Sequoia,Oxford Partners - along with such firms as Welsh Carson Anderson andamp; Stowe andWarburg Pincus that are better known for their buyout activity.andO;Traditionally, technology companies haven't been favorable venues for buyoutsbecause of their low asset bases, high price/earnings ratios, and earningsvolatility.andP;  Furthermore, their entrepreneurial founders haven't often beenwilling sellers.andP;  There is no point to a buyout if the company's principalassets - technical talent - walk out after the sale.andP;  Nazem andamp; Co. thinks allof those conditions are changing enough to allow buyout techniques toflourish in the technology industries.andM;Taking on JapanandM;We're especially intrigued by the chip equipment deals because of theindustry's reputation for cyclicality and intense (to put it mildly) foreigncompetition.andP;  But the conventional wisdom may not apply in all cases.andP;  Nazem,which led the purchase of Tegal from Motorola, argues that the company'sstrong position in the plasma etch market, especially in Japan and otherforeign markets, make Tegal an exception.andM;Hambro makes a similar case for Tylan, which was acquired for $9.6 million byVacuum General with financing arranged by Hambro, and for Veeco, a managementbuyout also backed by Hambro.andP;  Prospects for reduced cyclicality and lowmultiples make semiconductor equipment companies good buyout candidates, theargument runs.andP;  Furthermore, a total investment of only $5 million has givenHambro strong equity positions in two companies with aggregate sales of $75million.andM;Small worldandM;Buyouts aren't for everyone, but few venture capitalists have been able toavoid the globalization issue.andP;  Not that many are ready to follow the lead ofPeter Brooke at Advent International, who has built a global network ofventure affiliates.andP;  But an ability to tap foreign sources of capital andexpertise, both for their own funds and for their portfolio companies, isbecoming an important success factor for many firms.andP;  All of Mayfield'sportfolio companies have either raised money abroad or are thinking about it.andO;For most Americans, it may still be a bit early to attempt direct ventureinvesting abroad, even through the intermediary of a local venture capital..andO;fund.andP;  U.S.-style venture capital is still foreign to most of Europe.andP;  Manydreams of building new companies have gone nowhere because big companiesstill dominate technology.andM;Venturesome BritsandM;There is little transfer between universities and startups, except perhaps inSweden.andP;  Even there, a professor with a bright technical idea usually takesit to a big company rather than try to find backing for an independentattempt to commercialize it.andP;  In addition, European entrepreneurs often findit difficult to give up control to outside investors.andP;  The exception isBritain, where the early-stage venture investment is catching on.andP;  GeoffTaylor, who heads the U.S.andP;  branch of 3i, the largest British venture capitalfirm, says British entrepreneurs &quot;now see merit in having people help youbuild the company.&quot;andM;Far horizonsandM;Elsewhere in Europe, venture capital flows mainly to existing businesses,perhaps to modernize an underperforming French or Belgian company and expandit across adjacent borders.andP;  Although the European Venture CapitalAssociation recorded $4.6 billion in new venture funds in 1988, and probably$5.7 billion last year  chart on Page 1), much of that capital went forbuyouts in nontechnology areas.andP;  Even this limited form of venture capital isin trouble in Italy, where the government is proposing legislation to killleveraged buyouts, which it regards as a means of evading taxes.andO;Nevertheless, some U.S.andP;  firms are beginning to check out the action abroad.andO;Kleiner Perkins put $1.4 million into Oxford Glycosystems, an instrumentationcompany formed around the work of carbohydrate scientist Raymond Dwek atOxford University.andP;  Connecticut-based Oxford Partners is sticking a toe intoBritish waters as well with an investment in the London Horizon Fund, a seedfund dedicated to backing companies that transfer technology to othercountries.andM;Go West., young investorsandM;Venture opportunities in Asia are being tested also.andP;  U.S.-style venturecapital has not taken off in Japan, but Britain's 3i believes its traditionalapproach of modestly leveraged investing will work there and recently joinedwith the Industrial Bank of Japan to start a small venture fund.andM;Starting everywhere at onceandM;Prospects are brighter among the newly industrializing Asian &quot;Tigers.&quot; SanFrancisco-based Walden Capital now manages funds totaling $50 million inTaipei, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur and is out raising two more Asian seedfunds.andP;  Walden's Asian business was profitable in its second year, sayspartner George Sarlo, because rates of return are &quot;substantially greater&quot;than in the United States.andM;Contacts abroad could help more U.S.andP;  startup companies to begin life asmultinationals.andP;  Momenta, the latest notebook computing entry, already hasoperations in Taiwan, Japan, and Europe, with Walden helping to bring localinvestors into the Taiwan subsidiary.andP;  We think this approach will beincreasingly important as globalization proceeds - as it will.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
