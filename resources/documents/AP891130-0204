(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Andrew Rivers is a bright, witty 10-year-oldwhose 2-foot-11-inch frame is so brittle he breaks like a chinadoll.   ``He will never be a Joe Namath; an Albert Einstein, maybe. Wetake things one day at a time,'' said Mary Rivers, whose son hasosteogenesis imperfecta, a relatively rare genetic bone disorderfor which science has no cure.   It's caused more than 30 fractures so far, stunted Andrew'sgrowth and left him confined to a wheelchair. Doctors don't know ifhe'll ever walk.   ``At the moment there are really no good medical therapies thatmake a difference long term,'' says Dr. Peter Byers, a Seattlemedical geneticist who specializes in inherited diseases, includingosteogenesis imperfecta.   For the short term, surgeons put metal rods through the bones inAndrew's deformed legs to strengthen them. Rodding, exercise andexternal splinting seem to be the best that medicine has to offerOI patients.   An estimated 20,000 to 25,000 Americans suffer from the disease,which is a lack of collagen or protein in the bone. It is eitherinherited or caused by some mutation in a gene. OI patients oftenhave triangular heads and barrel chests that can lead to pulmonaryand spinal problems.   Andrew has a 7-year-old buddy, Alex Metcalf, who also suffersfrom OI. The two match wits at computer games or sit giggling onthe living room carpet as they bat a sponge ball around in a fastgame of catch. The die-hard football fans cheer the Tampa BayBuccaneers from the sidelines during home games.   Alex was born with three breaks and four shortened bones.   ``Basically, we were told to handle this child as finecrystal,'' said his father, Matt Metcalf. ``But you've got toassess the risk, take precautions, then let them go out and playdespite the outcome. The interaction is important.''   Sometimes, just twisting during sleep can break a child's limb.Picking up a baby up can fracture the frail bones. Often parentssandwich newborns between pieces of foam for support to turn thechild over or change a diaper.   Andrew broke an arm while asleep; his right leg at six months,his left leg the month after.   ``Here we have all this attention on child abuse and I'mcarrying around this little body with all these casts,'' said Mrs.Rivers. ``I was ready to get a T-shirt that read: `I have brittlebones.'''   At Lake Fern Montessori Academy where Andrew is a fifth-grader,Principal Nettie Rossi credits Mary and Conrad Rivers for theirson's academic and social achievements. ``They're so supportive.They explain things, prepare him, then let him go out and do whathe has to do. They don't baby him.''   As a result, Andrew plays ball from his wheelchair and doespushups with his class of 27. ``He has a really good outlook. I'msure he has his moments but they don't show here,'' Mrs. Rossisaid. ``He has a sense of hummor, is bright, a goodconversationalist and just an all-around good guy. The kids treathim like one of them.''   OI can be so severe it claims a child at birth, or so mild aperson may only show the tell-tale blue sclerae, a blue color tothe whites of the eyes, and suffer a few dozen fractures over alifetime.   ``Some clearly have a shortened life span. They get curvature ofthe spine, or suffer compressed lungs making the heart and lungswork harder. Others have a near normal life,'' Byers said.   ``It's devastating news at birth that your child has amind-boggling disease,'' said Bob Phillips, 42, an accountant witha mild case of OI who is director of accounting for the Shrinersand treasurer of the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation Inc., bothheadquartered in Tampa.   The foundation formed as a volunteer organization in 1970. InNovember 1987, members decided to organize and centralize to offersupport, help collect information about the disease and share itwith other patients and with members of the medical profession.   Phillips, 4-foot-10 and ambulatory, said he stopped countingbone breaks after more than 90 during his growing years, adding,``We do break easy, but we seem to heal faster and that's a plus.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 4</NOTE></DOC>
