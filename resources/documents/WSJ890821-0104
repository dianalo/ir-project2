By his side is Lech Walesa. &quot;Together we will build Poland,&quot; the prime minister-designate tells the Solidarity supporters. Mr. Mazowiecki is interrupted by strong chanting from the back of the crowd. &quot;We want bread,&quot; the hecklers shout, &quot;not a prime minister.&quot;    Finishing what he has to do before interruption is the greatest task facing the man set to be Poland's first non-Communist prime minister since World War II. Only four months ago, the trade union Solidarity became legal here. In a breath-taking change last week, Solidarity's political arm managed to pull a large chunk of power away from the Communists and president Wojciech Jaruzelski and is in the process of forming a Solidarity-led government. That's fast work. But it may not be fast enough in a nation where Latin American-style inflation and a foreign debt of some $40 billion are devastating the life of the populace. Indeed, measures the new government will have to take to push the nation toward recovery could worsen things over the short term.    The test facing the new 62-year-old leader is of historic proportions. &quot;Reform&quot; is a tarnished word in Eastern Europe, where for decades Communist regimes have wasted their people's good will as well as Western funds in the name of change that has failed to improve the standard of living or bring full political freedom. For Solidarity and its partners to succeed where Communists have failed, they will have to complete an internal revolution as daunting as their ascent to power: They must convert a trade union to a force for the free market.    To attend a Mass for Solidarity followers in Gdansk's red brick St. Brygida Church is to witness the national will to meet that challenge. &quot;Poland lives,&quot; sing pensioners, veterans in red and white armbands, and children sporting red Solidarity pins. The priest, draped in white silk, begins the ceremony with an announcement that brings unchurchly applause: &quot;Poland's first Catholic prime minister takes part in this Mass.&quot; The sermon is about Saint Jeremy, who like Mr. Mazowiecki was in prison and &quot;needed to be rescued.&quot; Seated by the altar along with other Solidarity leaders is the gray-browed Mr. Mazowiecki. When he and Mr. Walesa receive Communion the entire church kneels with them and prays.    That is appropriate. For something like a miracle is what the career journalist and dissident will need to turn around the Polish economy. Officially, the inflation rate is 150%; unofficially, it is far greater. Today, 7,000 zlotys buy one dollar on the black market, compared with 2,000 just last year and 600 in 1987. Politically, the new government may be taking over at an opportune moment but economically things couldn't be worse. Just two weeks ago the government freed food prices as part of its reform program, doing away with the meat-rationing system that's been around since the time of martial law. The result has been a run on meat that means the lines and discontent are even greater than before. Similar shortages exist in products such as sugar, shampoo and matches.    The government Solidarity is building to meet such challenges represents radically new territories for a clan of unionists. Intellectuals and economists have played an important supporting role in the resistance movement during the long years it had been banned under martial law. Mr. Mazowiecki himself is an example. He served in Parliament from 1961 to 1971 and published an important dissident weekly in the early Solidarity era. His work for the group landed him in prison for a while. Now for the first time such background figures as he become some of Solidarity's leading faces. Mr. Walesa, Solidarity's hero, is refraining from taking office himself. Mr. Mazowiecki this week is expected to fill other Solidarity-controlled ministry spots with people like himself. For now at least, the sentiment in the churchyard indicates, the new government will have the workers' support.    To resolve the economic crisis, though, Solidarity will have to take measures that result in yet greater shortages and higher prices -- at least over the short haul. They will have to refuse workers' demands that wage increases be indexed to the racing inflation. They will also have to restructure and cut back the industries that are the main source of Poland's malaise, meaning layoffs.    Such measures will hit hardest the union's own constituents, the workers who rallied around the outcast union and brought it to power in the first place. Western aid may help but will not be a panacea. American Barbara Piasecka Johnson, for instance, may succeed in rescuing the historic Lenin shipyard here in Gdansk with a $100 million purchase of a majority share of the yard. But such massive philanthropy won't be available for most of Poland's rusty heavy industry.    If the fledgling democracy is to fly, Poles may be asked for some paradoxical sacrifices, such as forsaking what until now has been their principal political weapon: the strike. Here among the Gdansk cranes Solidarity was born nine years ago out of walk-outs that involved reinstating a handful of workers and getting a 2,000-zloty pay raise. When President Bush called on Warsaw this summer, Solidarity leaders asked for $10 billion of the Polish debt to be forgiven. The Bush administration has offered outright aid of about 1% of that, $119 million. The Common Market is matching that with a like amount of food aid. But the extraordinary political change taking place here now may move President Bush or Congress to open America's pocketbook.    In giving Solidarity and its partners the economic portfolio, the Communists are dumping on them the most thankless task. President Jaruzelski and the Communist Party retain control of foreign affairs and the interior ministry, in other words, the military and the police. They therefore remain a threat to their non-Communist partners. At the moment though, it is the Communists who are struggling with a confidence crisis; their leaders spent all weekend meeting in emergency plenum over how to handle the new situation. If the Communists disintegrate, some fear, chaos may ensue, triggering military intervention from within Poland or from outside.    &quot;Poles are anarchists,&quot; said an official who works in foreign affairs. &quot;And the hope is that this time will be the exception and they will overcome their anarchy.&quot; It is a tradition that goes back to the 18th century when Polish nobles proudly refused to fund a provisionary army, telling the royalty that they were pleased to be &quot;unruly.&quot; The result was a nation partitioned by more powerful and decisive forces from Russia, Prussia and Austria. It would be tragic if such a mentality were to trigger a clampdown. The extent of the fiercely anti-Communist mood is indicated in an exchange between Solidarity supporters and hecklers at the Gdansk churchyard as the adversaries shout &quot;Reds&quot; at one another.    The nearly universal hope in Poland, however, is that Communism has gasped its last breath. The refrain from the Mass in Gdansk held for the future prime minister rings throughout the land: &quot;Poland must live, Poland must grow.&quot;    ---   Ms. Shlaes is editorial-features editor of The Wall Street Journal/Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
