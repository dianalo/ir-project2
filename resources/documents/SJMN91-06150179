Or I'llhold a door open for someone and they'll walk right through without so much asa thank you, as though it was their right.&quot; San Jose mortgage broker RomeoDanais shares Semas' feeling. &quot;I see it (the decline of civility) amongservice personnel,&quot; he notes. &quot;Few seem to care about being helpful. And thereare fewer thank yous and you're welcomes.&quot; Two observations don't make ascientific survey, of course, but could they be marking the start of a furtherslide in civil behavior? Oddly enough, both Semas and Danais said they'dnoticed better manners by young people during the same period, so perhaps thefuture holds hope. As for me, I'll know we're on the road to a kinder,gentler, less self-obsessed nation when drivers who see traffic lights turnyellow slow down.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ARE WE TAKING THE CIVIL OUT OF CIVILIZATION?  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     TUBE TALK -- Is it just me or do you think that San Jose orchardist CarlCilker and Rob Morrow of TV's &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; could have been separated atbirth? . . . After putting in years on the Bay Area comedy circuit, a coupleof San Jose comics are starting to see their careers take off. Kal Clarke andDon McMillan, who recently played the Arts andamp; Entertainment cable network'scomedy show with John Byner, will show their stuff in a half-hour MTV comedyperformance next. The show, taped last week, will air in mid-June. . . .Tougher sledding for Ron Jabaut of the National Korean War VeteransAssociation, who has been trying to line up vets willing to discuss prisonerof war issues on KICU-TV's &quot;Left, Right and Center.&quot; &quot;I've had lots of Vietnamvets who are willing but none from the Korean War,&quot; Jabaut laments. If youdon't believe that old military advice about never volunteering, his daytimenumber is (408) 286-3051.;    BUSINESS AS UNUSUAL -- Forget the old whineabout having nothing new to do. There's a run of events coming that shouldappeal to even the most jaded. Among them: The appearance of the Washu CitizenChorus of Okayama, Japan, which performs with the San Jose Symphonic Choirtoday, 7:30 p.m., at the St. Joseph Cathedral. A prior stop on Washu's tour:Carnegie Hall. This isn't amateur night. . . . No routine fare for studentactors at San Jose's Piedmont Middle School. Thursday through Sunday, thesixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders will perform &quot;She Sat Behind Me&quot; -- a playabout acquaintance rape. They grow up early. . . . The subject matter may bemore predictable when Theater in the Mountains performs &quot;Stable Ground?&quot;, anoriginal play by Shannon Edwards, Friday and Saturday. It'll be at the oldLoma Prieta School amphitheater on Summit Road in the Santa Cruz Mountains --only a whoop and a holler from the epicenter of the 1989 quake.;    SEVENS UP-- The recent item about the odometer on Charlie Oppenheimer's car turning77,777 on the day he introduced Apple Computer's System 7.0 stirred the memoryof Larry Johnson of Los Altos. It was July 7, 1977 (or 7/7/77), he recalls,when he and his wife dined at the Fish Market in Palo Alto and their bill cameto $7.77. &quot;That was for dinner for two,&quot; Johnson notes, &quot;which from today'sperspective is amazing in itself.&quot; (But perspective aside, Larry, the nexttime you hit a run of sevens, don't wait 14 years -- 2 times 7 -- beforeletting the rest of us know.)  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Leigh Weimers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910529  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  624  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 29, 199100150179,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
