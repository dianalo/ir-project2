<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-66-0274 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Nevada Test Site is used by the United States Department of Energy(U.S. DOE), primarily for the testing of nuclear weapons. A portion ofthe site has been designated as a repository for low-level radioactivewaste. In anticipation of permitting this location as a mixed waste disposalsite, certain studies have been undertaken by REECo under the auspicesof the U.S. DOE, Hazardous Waste Remedial Actions Program. In 1985 alarge accidental spill of jet aviation fuel occurred at the Desert Rockairstrip on the Nevada Test Site. Study of the distribution of certaincomponents of the fuel will aid in the development of soil air samplersfor the vadose zone. These will be useful for the investigation of themigration of hazardous substances from a mixed waste disposal site orother underground storage facility. A general description of the topography,geology, hydrology, and meteorology of the NTS is given. Also, the planof investigation for development of the sampler is presented. 34 refs.,13 figs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
