The decision was announced by U.S. Trade Representative CarlaHills, who said the talks would have a deadline of producingresults over the next eight months.   Hills acted after the Shipbuilders Council of America, thelobbying group for the U.S. industry, filed a petition chargingthat foreign commercial shipbuilding subsidies offered by the fourcountries violated international trade rules against such subsidies.   The four nations account for nearly 60 percent of all thecommerical ship construction on order around the world. Because ofthe subsidies, the American shipbuilding industry is in a ``stateof virtual collapse,'' the Shipbuilders Council had argued in itspetition.   U.S. shipbuilders had petitioned Hills to begin an investigationinto the subsidies with the threat that if they were not removedwithin a year, the four nations could face U.S. trade sanctions.   Hills, however, rejected the industry's request for the formalinvestigation, with its more strict deadlines for sanctions, infavor of eight months of informal talks held under the auspices ofthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-basedorganization which regulates world trade.   She said if the talks fail to produce results by March 31 ofnext year, she would accept the petition from the U.S. shipbuildersto consider actual trade sanctions.   ``I will review our progress toward a multilateral agreement byMarch 31, 1990. If I believe, in consultation with the industry,that insufficient progress is being made in our negotiations, Iwill invite the shipbuilders to re-submit their petition,'' shesaid in announcing her decision.   When U.S. shipbuilders filed their petititon, they claimed thatshipyards in the four countries were getting large governmentsubsidies that had enabled them to sell ships at cut-rate priceswhile U.S. shipyards had received no new contracts for commercialvessels since 1985.   The petition had the support of 96 members of Congress includingrepresentatives from Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Virginia,Maryland and Maine, which have large shipyards in their districts.</TEXT></DOC>
