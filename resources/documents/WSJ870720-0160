James Hindman, founder and chairman, said.    Based on about 14.5 million common shares outstanding, this would indicate net income of $8.1 million to $8.7 million. In fiscal 1987, ended March 31, the operator of automotive lubrication centers earned $3.6 million, or 30 cents a share. During that period, Jiffy Lube had about 12.3 million shares outstanding.    Mr. Hindman said he expects fiscal 1988 sales to jump to about $80 million from $44 million in fiscal 1987.    He didn't offer a specific earnings estimate for the first quarter, ended June 30, but he said in an interview that results would be &quot;pretty big&quot; compared with year-earlier net income of $567,002, or six cents a share. Jiffy Lube expects to report results early this week.    The company plans to be operating 900 centers by the end of calendar 1987. Jiffy Lube previously had projected a total of 700 centers by year's end, but an expanded advertising campaign and other efforts have stimulated interest among franchise prospects. </TEXT></DOC>
