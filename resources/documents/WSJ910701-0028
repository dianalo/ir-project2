These children aremore likely than their peers in single-parent families tohave siblings, to have parents with college educations andhigh incomes, and to live in the suburbs and in homes ownedby their parents.   Fully 84% of children living with two parents have one ormore siblings, according to a March 1990 Census Bureau surveyof living arrangements, compared with 71% of children livingwith one parent. Children living with two parents areespecially likely to have one or two brothers or sisters --68%, vs. 57% of children living with one parent -- but arejust slightly more likely to have three or more siblings, 16%vs. 15%.   Twenty-seven percent of children living with two parentshave a parent with four or more years of college education,compared with just 9% of children living with single parents.   One-third of children in two-parent homes have familyincomes of $50,000 or more, compared with only 6% of childrenliving with one parent.   At least in part because their families are more affluent,73% of children who live with both parents live in homestheir parents own, while 65% of children with single parentslive in rental properties. Affluence and homeownership oftenmeet in the suburbs. Half of children who live with bothparents live in the suburbs of large cities, while nearlyhalf of those with single parents live in big cities. Justover 20% of children in both kinds of families live outsideof metropolitan areas.                                                                                                          Higher Marks for Women   Don't Mean Better Pay   WOMEN'S educational achievements surpass those of theirmale peers in many ways, but their monetary rewards still lagbehind.   A Department of Education study followed a sample of menand women from the high school class of 1972 through 14 yearsafter graduation. The women did better in high school. Onaverage, women who continued their education after highschool ranked in the 66th percentile of their high schoolclass, while men ranked in the 55th percentile.   Parents of the class of '72 had lower educationalexpectations for their daughters than for their sons. Half ofmothers and fathers hoped their daughters would earn at leastbachelor's degrees, while 59% of fathers and 69% of mothershad such ambitions for their sons. Despite this, women andmen who graduated from high school in 1972 were equallylikely to attend college, at 55%.   Among high school graduates, more men than women earnedpostsecondary degrees, 31% to 29%. But women degreerecipients got better grades than men and finished schoolfaster. Women's grade-point averages were higher than men'sin all fields studied, including engineering, math andbusiness. Among women who earned bachelor's degrees, 67% didso within 4 1/2 years, vs. 55% of men.   Among those in the class of 1972 who worked full time atsome point from 1976 to 1985, women accumulated nearly asmany years of work experience as men. Women with childrenworked an average of 7.5 years from 1976 to 1985, comparedwith 7.8 years for women without children, and eight yearsfor men.   But women's earnings were lower. Mothers who worked earnedan average of $15,000 in 1985, compared with $19,000 forwomen without children and $25,000 for men.                                                                                                          College Grads Less Likely   To Marry in Other Groups                                                                                                          MEN AND WOMEN with similar educations have always pairedup. Now they're doing it at higher levels.   The share of newlyweds with similar educational levelsrose to 53% in 1985-87 from 52% in 1940, according to ananalysis of Census Bureau data by Robert D. Mare of theUniversity of Wisconsin. But this figure masks the fact that&quot;intermarriage&quot; between people with at least a year ofcollege education and those without is less likely than inthe past.   In 1940, 15% of new husbands had some postsecondaryeducation, compared with 11% of new wives. Just 46% of menwith at least a year of college were married tocollege-educated women.   By 1985-87, the college gap had closed. Fully 46% of bothbrides and grooms had some college education, and the shareof college-educated husbands with college-educated wives roseto 74%.   The same trend holds from the women's perspective. In1940, 63% of college-educated women married college-educatedmen. In 1985-87, that figure rose to 74%.   College matches are the most common these days, making up34% of all newlywed couples. Twenty-six percent sharehigh-school educations, and in 5% of couples, neither spousefinished high school. The remaining 35% of marriages arehybrids, with husbands and wives who have mixed college andnoncollege educations. In 1940, both spouses werecollege-educated in 7% of married couples; in 14%, both hadhigh school educations; and in 45%, neither had finished highschool.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          MORE THAN nine out of 10 older parents have childrennearby. The 1987-88 National Survey of Families andHouseholds conducted by the Center for Demography and Ecologyat the University of Wisconsin found that 18% of parents age65 or older live with an adult child, and another 74% have agrown child within 25 miles. . . . A survey by MaritzMarketing Research in early June shows that 68% of men, and82% of women, shopped at department stores in the previousthree months; 95% of the men, and 94% of the women, boughtsomething.</TEXT></DOC>
