Ex-Im Bank Chairman John Macomber said the board and acabinet-level committee that oversees the bank's loanpolicies gave it the go-ahead to offer the guarantees if aU.S. vendor wins the huge award for 200 helicopters. Thelikely U.S. supplier is United Technologies Corp.'s Sikorskydivision, which last month clinched another contract tosupply the Turkish National Police with S-70A Blackhawkhelicopters with the help of $37.7 million in loan guaranteesfrom the Ex-Im Bank.</LP><TEXT>   The latest prospective deal signals a turning point inU.S. arms-export policy. The bank traditionally has shiedaway from the defense trade, insisting that its limitedresources be used to finance nonmilitary U.S. business. ItsTurkey decision, however, shows the bank is willing to serveas financier for U.S. arms sales to middle-income allies thatcan't afford to pay cash for U.S. weapons.   Mr. Macomber said the gulf crisis surrounding Turkey was afactor in the bank's decision. &quot;We had to do something fasterthan usual&quot; because of the crisis.   The Bush administration has been quietly crafting a newpolicy to help U.S. defense contractors expand their exportsales. Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of state,last month ordered U.S. ambassadors to get on board byhelping open doors for U.S. defense vendors, according to hisaides.   The use of Ex-Im Bank financing, however, had remained a&quot;sticking point&quot; in forming the new policy, the aides said. Apolicy paper recommending its use for defense sales remainsstuck in the Office of Management and Budget because ofconcerns by some White House aides about the propriety ofexpending the bank's resources in this manner.   Mr. Macomber said the prospective Turkish deal isspecifically authorized by a law passed last year thatauthorizes such guarantees for military sales to Turkey andGreece. Democratic Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticutspearheaded the effort to pass this and other laws thateffectively give such companies as United Technologies, basedin Hartford, Conn., wider access to Ex-Im Bank financing.   The Ex-Im Bank's role of financing arms sales to otherallies could become policy if an amendment to the ExportAdministration Act introduced by Sens. Dodd and ChristopherBond (R. Mo.) becomes law. The Senate is scheduled toconsider changes to the export act when it returns from itsAugust recess.   U.S. defense industry spokesmen said Sikorsky is facingtough competition for the Turkish sale from French andItalian vendors, which have the solid backing of theirgovernments.</TEXT></DOC>
