(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of evacuees returned to their homesunder sunny skies Friday to find water-logged carpets and damagedfurniture from a flood that claimed at least six lives.   Central Florida dried out from four days of torrential rainsthat sent rivers surging over their banks.   ``Today, we have sunshine and dry feet,'' said Red Cross workerJean Ann Crutchfield as shelters closed in Pinellas County. Theshelters had housed 160 people overnight.   Weather forecasters said the near-stationary front responsiblefor the battering storm continued to drift north. The storm systemwas not connected with Hurricane Florence, which was roaring up thesoutheast Louisiana coast Friday.   Forecasters said Friday it didn't appear as if the storm systemwould join forces with Hurricane Florence.   Gov. Bob Martinez took an aerial tour of hardest-hit ManateeCounty and said afterward he would sign an executive order Saturdaydeclaring a state of emergency to pave the way for state crews tohelp assess damage and clear debris.   County public works officials estimated between $12 and $24million in damages to 37 bridges.   Although flooding was subsiding, Martinez said he could see fromthe air effects of the monsoon-like downpours that dumped 15 inchesof rain in two days, pushed the Manatee River 9 feet above floodstage and swelled the county's reservoir to the highest level since1974.   Martinez predicted the county would qualify for federal disasterassistance. He said state assessment teams would collect damagedata from homeowners to determine if the county met federaldisaster relief criteria.   The flooding prompted local officials to declare a state ofemergency Wednesday and order the evacuation of 1,000 people. Manyreturned home Thursday.   Throughout the Tampa Bay area, waterfront residents spent Fridayripping out soaked carpets, patching leaky roofs and stackingruined furniture in garages or on front lawns.   While flood waters were subsiding in Manatee, Hillsborough,Pinellas and Pasco counties, trouble spots remained.   In Tampa, traffic was diverted around a closed stretch offlooded Interstate 4, a key artery and hurricane evacuation route.   The Alafia River southeast of Tampa crested Friday at 7 feetabove flood stage, covering cars and riverfront homes up to theroofline. West across Tampa Bay in St. Petersburg, overflowingcreeks swamped streets and homes in scattered communities leavingpeople in low-lying areas wading through knee-deep water.   A tornado hit St. Petersburg on Thursday night, causing damageto six houses, but no injuries were reported.   The rising waters from the Tampa-area storm left two dead on thewest coast. James Edward Mercer, 44, of Tampa was drowned Wednesdayafter his car plunged into a ditch and he was sucked into anunderground pipe near downtown Tampa. His body was found Friday aquarter mile away. In New Port Richey, 2-year-old Matthew Rehmdrowned in a rain-swollen canal.   The storm front also contributed to the crash of a small planeWednesday that killed all four on board near Williston, about 110miles north of Tampa.</TEXT></DOC>
