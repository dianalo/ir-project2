But the employees are far from thrilled. That's becauselate last week they also were required to sign an agreementthat authorizes the big securities firm under certaincircumstances to yank back as much as 40% of their 1990 cashbonuses.</LP><TEXT>   The raise, which is effective in 1991, increasesdirectors' base salaries to between $150,000 and $200,000from the current $100,000. Managing directors will receive$200,000 to $250,000, up from the current $150,000, peoplefamiliar with the firm said.   But here's the hitch: Salary alone typically is just atiny part of overall compensation. Even in a down year, suchas 1990, a bonus may exceed 80% of total compensation. Andbonuses at CS First Boston are down roughly 40% this year,according to the firm's executives.   Making matters more difficult, employees say, is theagreement they recently were asked to sign. That agreement,given to employees on Dec. 20 and required to be signed byDec. 27, stipulated that those who quit before the end of1992 must give 40% of their 1990 cash bonus back to CS FirstBoston. If they leave within three years, they also give backall or part of their 1990 bonus that they received in CSFirst Boston stock, which made up about half their 1990compensation package.   &quot;The net of the equation is that overall compensation isgoing to be factored down at a time when {employees are}facing a potential penalty&quot; for leaving, says Jeffrey L.Liddle, an attorney with the New York firm Liddle, O'Connor,Finkelstein andamp; Robinson who represents securities-firmemployees.   CS First Boston officials declined to comment on thecompensation changes or agreement.   The firm's salary strategy is part of a plan under whichSwitzerland's CS Holding agreed last month to pump $300million in equity into its CS First Boston unit, parent ofinvestment bank First Boston Corp.   Mr. Liddle also contends that employees didn't have enoughtime to consider the accord's ramifications. &quot;They gave thisthing to people to sign over the Christmas holiday,&quot; makingit more difficult to get a private attorney and without muchtime to think about it, he says.   First Boston officials privately retort that employeeshave known about the proposed changes informally for severalweeks.   In a separate internal memo, the firm said employees whoaren't asked to sign an employment agreement will be paid atleast 60% of their cash bonus in the next two weeks. &quot;Anyremaining cash payments are scheduled to be paid on or aboutFebruary 15, 1991,&quot; the memo said.</TEXT></DOC>
