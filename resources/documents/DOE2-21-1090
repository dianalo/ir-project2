<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-21-1090 </DOCNO><TEXT>Thin films of Au, Ag have been evaporated on (0001) surface of sapphireand then the interfaces were irradiated with xenon ions. Ion energy of1.5 MeV, fluences of 3x10/sup 15/ to 2.2x10/sup 16/ ions cm/sup -2/ andirradiation temperatures at 77 and 300 K were used. The evolutions ofthe interfaces were studied by different techniques such as Rutherfordbackscattering spectrometry (RBS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),optical absorption, X-ray diffraction at glancing incidence and electricalresistivity measurements. Blistering is observed for all specimens bombardedwith fluences as low as 3x10/sup 15/ ions cm/sup -2/. The RBS analysisseems to show a ballistic mixing at Ag or Au-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ interfacesbut X-ray diffraction at glancing incidence does not reveal any new compoundformation at the interfaces. Nevertheless optical absorption shows theformation of silver or gold metallic precipitates embedded into Al/sub2/O/sub 3/.</TEXT></DOC>
