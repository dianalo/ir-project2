Esteban Torres ofCalifornia, a co-chairman of the group, told the Sunday morninggathering. ``We're coming together here for the first time and itwill not be the last.''   The group, called National Hispanic Democrats, is made up ofMexican-Americans, Puerto Rican-Americans and Cuban-Americans.   About 200 of the 4,200 delegates to this week's DemocraticNational Convention are Hispanic.   Hispanics have drawn acute attention from both parties this yearbecause their growing vote is concentrated in key states likeCalifornia, Texas and Florida. Both Democratic presidentialcandidate-to-be Michael Dukakis and his Republican counterpartGeorge Bush have already pledged to appoint a Hispanic cabinetmember if elected.   The group said it hopes to capitalize on that interest.   ``What we have here is the most serious effort in recent timesto focus the Hispanic agenda,'' Torres said. ``Our challenge is notthe differences sometimes created by national origin or regionalbias but the similarities which over shadow our differences.''   In the past, organizers said, differences among the differentsegments of the Hispanic population have kept its clout fragmented.The new group has agreed to disagree on some issues, but agrees onthe need for improvements in education, jobs, health care and crimefighting as well as mobilizing the Hispanic vote in November.   ``The time is right for this to work,'' said co-chair MarifeHernandez, a Democratic Party activist from New York. ``We're goingto make sure that we're heard.''</TEXT></DOC>
