The method is basedon the introduction of additional data on vertex constants to the commonanalysis according to the distorted waves method (DWM). Essence of themethod is the following: at first the vertex constant is determined withextrapolation of experimental values of differential cross section; thennormalizing factor of the wave function is found; spectroscopic factoris calculated from the analytical expression for the vertex constant.The method is used for analysis of reactions (pd) on /sup 14/N and /sup19/F nuclei with /sup 18/F finite nuclei in ground and excited statesand with /sup 13/N in ground state.</TEXT></DOC>
