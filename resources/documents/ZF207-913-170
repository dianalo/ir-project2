a spokesman for McDonnell said hehad heard nothing of the talk, and that as far as he was aware plans to floatthe company in second quarter 1990 were on track.andM;- o -andM;In the run up to the US listing of Borland International Inc on NASDAQ,highlighted here at the beginning of last week (CI No 1,304), its sharessoared up over 100 pence on the UK Unlisted Securities Market during the weekproviding a killing for those shrewd enough to buy last Monday: they beganthe week at 590 pence, finishing at 698 pence on Friday, having slowlyaccelerated 5 pence up on Monday and again on Tuesday, moving up 10 onWednesday, and leaping 25 on Thursday and 60 pence on Friday.andM;- o -andM;Sir Clive Sinclair's Cambridge Computers Ltd is to launch an IBM-compatibleportable in April that will undercut Psion Plc's equivalent offering byaround 50%: the portable will have a single Citizen 3.5&quot; floppy drive andwill be available with 20Mb and 40Mb hard disks from Conner Peripherals Inc;it uses magnesium alloy casing to get weight down to just 3 lbs, is A4 sizeand prices will start at #700.andM;- o -andM;Basingstoke-based Frontline Distribution Ltd is &quot;under notice&quot; from AmstradPlc for not meeting Amstrad's criteria of &quot;energy, commitment and success&quot;:Frontline has been an Amstrad distributor for about three years (back to thedays when it was known as First Software) and has recently dropped Amstrad'sPCW and portable products in favour of concentrating on the high end ofcompany's personal computer range - Amstrad, however, is not convinced thatFrontline has the necessary commitment for such products (after all the buckfor those nasty results has to stop somewhere); Frontline had no comment andis awaiting the return of chairman John Weatherhead on Thursday before makinga statement - but it stands to lose half of its turnover from Amstrad'sdecision.andM;- o -andM;Determined at all costs to avoid letting the prize slip, McCaw CellularCommunications Inc raised its bid for LIN Broadcasting Corp to $150 a sharefor the 22.5m shares to give it a simple 51% majority.andM;- o -andM;IBM and MCA Inc completed the previously reported sale of their DiscovisionAssociates Inc - which is mainly a repository for patents these days - to USsubidiaries of Pioneer Electronics Corp for $200m.andM;- o -andM;British Telecommunications Plc has completed acquisition of Tymnet fromMcDonnell Douglas Corp: the price paid for the worldwide network operator was$355m in cash: it becomes BT Tymnet Inc with headquarters in San Jose,California.andM;- o -andM;As well as the allegedly fictitious contracts at International Signal andamp;Control, Ferranti International Signal Plc reveals that #100m of cash appearsto have been milked from the US defence electronics company, all but #12m ofit before Ferranti acquired the company in 1987: the cash appears to havebeen funnelled through Swiss and Panamanian companies since liquidated; thenews on Friday that business unconnected with the scandal was nowdeteriorating, and word that partners British Aerospace Plc and Thomson SAwere redoing all their figures valuing Ferranti ahead of their expecteid(with negative implications) caused Ferranti's share price to slump 4.5 penceto 49 pence in yesterday's trading.andM;- o -andM;France hopes to break the deadlock on European Community telecommunicationsliberalisation with a plan to allow private companies to offer basic datatransmission services over the public network, but to impose strict licencesissued by the national PTT - a compromise that is a long way from the degreeof liberalisation already operating in the UK, and substantially less thanthe European Commission is seeking.andM;- o -andM;The unscrutable face of what former premier Edward Heath called theunacceptable face of capitalism (actually, he meant to say &quot;facet&quot; but therewas a typo in his script) is taking DR-DOS to Japan: the Lonrho Pacific armof Lonrho Plc has formed Lonrho International Networks to market theMS-DOS-compatible Digital Research Inc operating system as EZ-DOS, bundlingit with GEM-3 for $90, on its own for $67.andM;- o -andM;The breakneck pace at which the Comecon countries are opening up andadmitting the possibility of Western companies investing in their localindustries creates some intriguing possibilities for the key computercompanies east of the iron curtain that is rapidly rusting away: GeneralElectric Co has led the way with its negotiations over the future ofHungary's Tungsram maker of exploding light bulbs, but Bull SA is well placedto be invited to invest in the computer arm of Videoton in Hungary; ICL,already assembling ME29s in Poland, and Ing C Olivetti andamp; Co SpA, whoseLogabax in France has long-standing ties with Mera both look well placed, butthe big prize would be VEB Kombinat Robotron, with bases in East Berlin,Dresden and Leipzig - while Siemens AG must be the front-runner to be invitedto invest, IBM itself may well be taking a look.andM;- o -andM;Agence France Presse reports that the 12 members of the European Communityhave agreed that talks with the other allies are needed to decide changes tothe rules established by CoCom, which are now felt to place &quot;excessive&quot;restrictions on the export of Western European technology to the Comeconcountries: after the summit on European Community policy towards EasternEurope held in Paris over the weekend, the French minister for EuropeanAffairs, Edith Cresson, said that as the rules stood at present, it wasimpossible to help the countries of Eastern Europe to take advantage of&quot;modern infrastructure, particularly in the field of telecommunications&quot;, andthat there was a general consensus that something needed to be done -although exactly what needed to be done had not yet been agreed on.andM;- o -andM;No details, but Unisys Corp has been awarded a $233.1m contract by the US AirForce Contract for desktop computers, related peripherals and other parts andservices.andM;- o -andM;Talks between the Communications Workers of America and Nynex Corp to settlethe strike that has now run for more than 100 days, collapsed in disarrayover the weekend.andM;- o -andM;No doubt well-trained by the current IBM name-your-own-price policy fordiscriminating and demanding customers, BASF AG's data processing departmenthas come up with a splendid deal-killer by drawing up a price-performancecurve and saying that it will not buy anything that falls below the line:&quot;but we haven't got anything that falls below the line,&quot;
