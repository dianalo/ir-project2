But the air force has told her, maybe not.   ``I would like to be a pilot, but can't be one in themilitary,'' she wrote to the newspaper Jyllands-Posten. ``It'sunjust!''   Two weeks later, Defense Minister Bernt Collet replied toKatrine in a letter to the same newspaper saying an air forcepolicy of keeping women from piloting military planes is underreview and likely to change.   Women are accepted in Denmark's armed forces but they cannot flyplanes.   Katrine, who specializes in science and mathematics at school,said by telephone from her home in the port city of Aalborg she wasdelighted with Collet's response.   ``I've been crazy about jet planes for years and enjoy visitingair force bases.''   But she added that she still has a problem.   ``My parents would rather I stayed on the ground.''   Nevertheless, she's decided to join a parachutist's club.   Last year the military began a study women pilots. Based mainlyon the experiences of other NATO countries, the report is expectedto be submitted to a parliamentary committee for action later thisyear.   ``The military chiefs seem to be very positive towards theproposal,'' said Maj. Benny Hansen of the air force, the DefenseMinistry official who deals with personnel.   A decision to allow women into flight training would be inkeeping with military policy laid down in 1980 of equal rights inall branches of the armed forces, Hansen added.   Experiments since 1980 placing women in combat units have provensuccessful, Hansen said.   ``The military hasn't noticed any weakening of fighting strengthin combat units with women in them.''   A total of 844 women, including 58 officers, were serving in allarmed forces branches as of June last year, the date of the latestavailable statistics. They were in field units in the infantry, thetank corps, surface-to-air missile squadrons and base patrol duties.   The navy has five women officers and 99 sailors. They serve oninspection vessels, corvettes and torpedo boats. But they aren't onsubmarines, where quarters are too close.   Hansen said he sees no problems for women as helicopter ortransport plane pilots. But experts are still concerned about howwomen would stand up to the extreme gravitational forcesexperienced by pilots of supersonic jets.   G-stress and speed and precision of reaction were problems formale fighter pilots, too, Hansen said.   In Denmark, aspiring combat pilots go to a two-year civilianflight school supervised by the military before being sent toUnited States for advanced training.   ``Female pilot trainees will face the same physical andpsychological demands that men do, and there will be no lowering ofstandards to get women in,'' Hansen said.   Nor would a woman's maritial status or the fact she had childrenbe taken into account, he added.   Hansen pointed out that in neighboring Norway, where womenalready train as military pilots, only two out of 300 candidateshave earned wings.   The Netherlands, Canada and United States also have trainedwomen pilots for their air forces.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, Feb. 24</NOTE></DOC>
