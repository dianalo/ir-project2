Theliquids used were monosubstituted benzaldehydes, benzaldehyde, nitrobenzene,and benzene. It was found that only monosubstituted benzaldehydes andbenzaldehyde had exchangeable /sup 1/H atoms. Then, the hydrogenisotopeexchange reaction between PVA(T) and the excess amount of one of themonosubstituted benzaldehydes or of benzaldehyde was studied in the temperaturerange of 50{similar_to}90deg C, and the following results were obtained:1. A hydrogen atom in a formyl group participates in the reaction. 2.The order of reactivity is benzaldehyde{approx_equal}o- andgt; m- andgt; p-tolualdehyde.3. The reactivity of the formyl group in monosubstituted benzaldehydes,except for orthosubstituted benzaldehydes, follows the Hammett rule.4. The activation energies for the o-, m-, p-tolualdehyde and benzaldehydeare 43, 48, 56, and 45 kJcenter dotmol/sup -1/, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
