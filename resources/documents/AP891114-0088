(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Students boycotted classes at theUniversity of Massachusetts for a second day today to protest statebudget cuts.   The 25,000-student university said it planned no sanctionsagainst those involved and had no count of the students taking part.   ``It's not massive. It's partial,'' Provost Richard D. O'Briensaid.   The protest was prompted by a $25 million cut in aid to publichigher education to help eliminate the Massachusetts budget deficit.   Lisa Nelson, a junior from Sunderland who helped organize theprotest, said students today targeted science classes, which manyprofessors agreed to cancel.   ``It's been building up all fall,'' said John Schmertzler, ajunior from West Springfield. ``They cut out a thousand classes andthey expect us to pay more when we can't even get into a class.''   The Amherst campus' share of the cutback is $6.4 million andresulted in a $350 increase next semester in the university'smandatory fees to $1,465. The fees come in addition to tuition,which was raised 8 percent this fall to $1,512.   University spokeswoman Joan Ashwell said the faculty unionestimated that 60 percent of classes were canceled Monday.   The faculty union made it clear it supported the students.   ``You need to convince your representatives and senators thatyou are a force to be reckoned with _ that you will support them ifthey support you,'' history Professor Bruce Laurie, union vicepresident, said at a rally Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
