The bill contained theweapons-sale prohibition, a ban that will affect all six countries that havepromised to help defray U.S. war expenditures.;    &quot;We've had to take out aninsurance policy on the credibility of our allies' promises, and that shouldbe deeply embarrassing to our allies,&quot; said Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., theAppropriations Committee chairman who sponsored the sale ban.;    The House'swar-financing measure, approved earlier this month, contained a much milderthreat to the allies. It warned that &quot;Congress may consider appropriateaction&quot; if allied pledges are not paid in full.;    The Senate bill alsocontained language barring the transfer of U.S. arms now in the Middle East toany country there without the consent of Congress. The provision could hinderIsraeli efforts to obtain Patriot surface-to-air missiles the United Statesstationed in the Jewish state during the war.;    Negotiators from the Houseand Senate hoped to meet today to iron out their differences on both bills.Their goal is to send them to President Bush by week's end.;    The closestany country has come to making good on its promised assistance to the UnitedStates is Germany, which has delivered $4.6 billion out of a $6.6 billionpledge, according to the Appropriations Committee. German officials, however,plan to ask if their payments can be reduced.;    Of the other nations, Japanhas paid $7.3 billion out of a promised $10.7 billion; the United ArabEmirates have paid $2 billion out of $4 billion pledged; and Saudi Arabia haspaid $6.1 billion out of $16.8 billion. Kuwait has paid $5.5 billion out of$16 billion, and South Korea has paid $71 million out of $385 million.;    Allsix countries are seeking to buy U.S. weapons this year, ranging so far from$9.4 billion in arms sought by the Saudis to $58 million by Kuwait, accordingto figures the administration has given Congress.;    Although U.S. costs ofthe gulf war remain uncertain, the lowest official estimate has been $45billion by the Congressional Budget Office.;    The $42.6 billionwar-financing measure relies on the foreign payments to pay the bills. But itprovides up to $15 billion in taxpayers' funds in case the alliedcontributions fall short.;    The legislation is designed to pay the costs ofthe conflict since last Oct. 1, when the 540,000-member U.S. force was stillbeing deployed, through the withdrawal now under way.;    Sen. Mark Hatfield,R-Ore., long an opponent of big military spending, cast the only vote againstthe bill. Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., did not vote.;    The accompanying $5.2billion measure contains funds for an assortment of programs, only some ofwhich are war-related.;    The aid for Israel and Turkey is designed toreimburse those countries for some of their war costs. Although neither nationentered the fighting, both had their armed forces on alert, and Israeldistributed gas masks to its citizens.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910320  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  584  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 20, 199100080097,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
