The study showed that 28 of the 35 workers at the Massachusetts plant in 1953 have died, mostly from asbestos-related diseases such as malignant mesothelioma, a kind of cancer. Six of the seven surviving workers have asbestos-related lung disease, the researchers said.    The study didn't address questions about the effects on smokers of the asbestos-containing filters. A spokesman for Lorillard Inc., the unit of New York-based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes, said that asbestos was used &quot;long ago in minuscule amounts&quot; in Kent's Micronite filters. She added that the asbestos-containing filters were introduced in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956. &quot;There is no asbestos in any of our cigarettes today,&quot; she said.    The study's finding of elevated disease rates among workers exposed to asbestos isn't surprising. But the amount of the increased risk appears much greater than for workers exposed to asbestos in other industries, said James Talcott, a researcher at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who presented the findings at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in New Orleans.    &quot;What we're showing is that there can be micro-epidemics with extremely high death rates among workers exposed to asbestos in industries other than those like shipbuilding and insulation,&quot; Dr. Talcott said. He added that past studies indicate that about 30% of deaths among workers exposed to asbestos result from asbestos-related diseases, compared with about 60% of deaths among workers in the Dana-Farber study.    One clue to the high death rates of the workers studied was the fact that about 80% of them smoked, compared with 53% of U.S. males in 1955. Past research has shown that smokers exposed to asbestos have especially high lung disease risks, suggesting that cigarette smoke and asbestos particles multiply each other's adverse effects.    An estimated 160 workers were exposed to asbestos between 1951 and 1958 at the Massachusetts factory, owned by Hollingsworth andamp; Vose Co. of East Walpole, Mass., Dr. Talcott said. He added that further study is needed to identify the surviving workers, particularly those who smoke, because they may be able to reduce their risk of asbestos-related diseases by quitting smoking.    Andrew McElaney, an attorney for Hollingsworth andamp; Vose, declined to comment on the Dana-Farber study. </TEXT></DOC>
