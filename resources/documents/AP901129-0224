McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Consumer spending, which makes up two-thirdsof the nation's economic activity, was flat in October, thegovernment said today. Personal incomes, meanwhile, inched up 0.1percent, failing to keep pace with inflation.   The Commerce Department said spending totaled a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of $3.73 trillion, unchanged from expendituresin September, which had risen 0.9 percent from the previous month.   At the same time, incomes totaled a seasonally adjusted annualrate of $4.71 trillion, up $5.7 billion from September when incomesrose 0.5 percent. But the advance did not match the 0.6 percentincrease in the Labor Department's consumer price index in October.   Spending had advanced every month since last May, whenconsumption also was unchanged. The meager gain in incomes was thepoorest showing since incomes were unchanged in August 1989.   It was the first look at consumer spending in the final quarterof the year when many analysts believe the economy has skidded intoa recession. The department Wednesday revised personal consumptionin the third quarter down from 3.6 percent in its initial report to3.2 percent.   Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic healthbecause it represents such a large percentage of the nation'seconomic activity.   Surveys show consumer confidence has plummeted during thePersian Gulf crisis at the same time the unemployment rate wasgrowing and the number of hours worked was shrinking.   Americans' savings rate - savings as a percent of disposableincome - edged up to 3.8 percent from 3.5 percent in September. TheSeptember rate was the lowest in three years, indicating thatconsumers were dipping into their savings to pay for theirpurchases.   Americans' savings rate for all of 1989 was 4.6 percent.   The report said Americans' disposable incomes, or incomes aftertaxes, inched ahead 0.1 percent, down from a 0.4 percent gain theprevious month. It was the smallest gain since after-tax incomesfell 0.1 percent last April.   The spending and income figures were not adjusted for inflation.When adjusted, spending fell 0.7 percent after a 0.2 percentincrease in September. Disposable income dropped 0.5 percent, evenmore than the 0.4 percent decline a month earlier.   A key component of the income category - wages and salaries -fell $9.3 billion after gaining $16.7 billion the previous month.   Spending on durable goods - usually expensive products expectedto last at least three years - fell $8.4 billion in October.Non-durable purchases were off $1.5 billion. Spending on servicesrose $8.9 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
