Aside from the human toll, the economic cost to the combatants,according to Israeli experts who followed the war closely, was morethan $200 billion through 1986. Nineteen months of furtherdevastation added to this figure.   Other countries have lost as well. The London insurance firm,Lloyd's, reports that in the Persian Gulf ``tanker war'' 90 shipswere sunk or destroyed and and 546 ships attacked, most of themdamaged.   Another 93 ships have been trapped in Iraqi waterways since thewar began, many of them written off.   Insurance losses paid out by Lloyd's on ship hulls has been morethan $1 billion. Other firms paid a similar amount, Lloyds said.   Iraq started the war with foreign exchange reserves of $35billion and now owes foreign countries an estimated $60 billion.   Iran has avoided borrowing but has run down its foreign exchangereserves to a few billion dollars.   Iran and Iraq refused to give figures on losses, human, materialor economic.   The Paris economic paper La Tribune, quoting Western economicexperts, says Iran needs $80 billion to rebuild transportfacilities, oil installations, housing, factories, schools andhospitals. It said Iraq needs $30 billion for the same task.   A report by Kiyotaki Tsuji of the Japanese institute of MiddleEast Economic Studies estimated that damage to oil installationsalone, from bombing and shelling raids, amounted to $28 billion forIran and $8 billion for Iraq.   Estimates of military equipment purchases for the war, abovenormal pre-war expenditures vary, from $25 billion to $40 billionfor Iran and from $35 billion to $70 billion for Iraq. Paying,feeding and treating wounded soldiers added billions more to warexpenditures.   Losses in oil revenues, estimated by Tsuji, are $23 billion forIran and $65 billion for Iraq. Pre-war production in Iraq was 3.6million barrels a day. It fell to 1.2 million barrels a day in 1981and gradually has been built back to 2.7 million barrels a day.   Iraqi bombing raids decimated Iran's refining capacity from 1.3million barrels a day pre-war, to 400,000 barrels a day, forcingthe Iranians to import petroleum products costing $1.5 million ayear, oil experts here estimated.   Iraqi raids damaged or put out of action Iranian refineries atAbadan, Isfahan, Shiraz, Tehran and Bakhtaran. The billion-dollaroil loading facility at Kharg island is virtually destroyed.Iranians wrecked Iraq's oil shipping terminal at Faw.   Construction in Iran has stopped because of Iraqi bombing at amajor petrochemical plant being built with Japanese help at BandarKhomeini, at the huge gas collection and treatment plant beingbuilt by South Koreans at Nar Kangan, and at a nuclear power plantat Bushehr.   Early in the war Iraq lost its 140,000 barrel-a-day oil refineryat Basra. Basra port was closed and two-thirds of the 1 millioninhabitants of the city fled shelling attacks from Iran whichdamaged most of the buildings.   Missiles and bombs did extensive damage to civilian facilitiesin other major cities on both sides, including Tehran and Baghdad.</TEXT></DOC>
