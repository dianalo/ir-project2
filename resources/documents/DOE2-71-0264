The technique developed uses accelerometer feedbackfrom the camera to attenuate disturbances viewed on the remote display.A model of the high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV) wasdeveloped to study the dynamics of the camera disturbances. A stabilizationcontrol algorithm was developed, and a test stand implementation to reducecamera jitter performed admirably. The camera control system can be implementedon the TOV to track motion of less than 1 Hz while attenuating disturbancesin the 1- to 10-Hz range. Disturbances greater than 20 Hz can be effectivelyreduced with passive damping types of suspension. Less expensive thancurrently used gyro-based units, the system requires minimal additionsto the TOV and is easily maintained. 5 refs., 10 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
