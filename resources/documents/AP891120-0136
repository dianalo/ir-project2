(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The man accused of driving drunk on thewrong side of a highway and causing the deaths of 27 people in achurch bus went on trial Monday under the watchful eyes of many ofthe victims' families.   A man whose wife and two daughters died when Larry Mahoney'spickup rammed the bus, causing an explosion, said the 36-year-oldfactory worker deserved nothing less than ``life in prisonforever.''   ``To me, (the trial) is a waste of time,'' said Army 1st Sgt.Lee Williams. ``The man is guilty, in my opinion, and life inprison is the minimum that he should get.''   Jury selection was completed Monday for Mahoney's murder trial.Jurors were then taken to see the wreckage of the bus and Mahoney'spickup, locked in a warehouse as evidence in the case, then to thecrash site on Interstate 71, about five miles south of Carrollton.   Police said Mahoney was driving north in the southbound laneswhen his pickup collided with the bus on May 14, 1988. Sixty-sevenmembers of the Radcliff First Assembly of God church's youth groupwere returning from an outing at the King's Island amusement park,north of Cincinnati.   Radcliff is the post office town for Fort Knox, where Williamswas chief enlisted man of a medical company at Ireland ArmyHospital.   ``Plain and simple, this is a murder case,'' Special ProsecutorPaul Richwalsky said in his opening statement. ``It's about who wasinvolved and who was responsible. It's about the terrible cost ofdrunken driving.''   Richwalsky, an assistant state attorney general, read aloud eachcount of the 82-count indictment, naming one of the crash victimsin each count.   Many people in the audience, including victims' survivors, wipedtears from their eyes or clenched their fists as Richwalsky readthe indictment.   Richwalsky also laid out the prosecution's theory of eventsleading up to the crash, what he described as Mahoney's a day ofdrinking before he ended up on the interstate. ``Simple case,tragic results,'' he said.   Russell Baldani, Mahoney's lead defense laywer, took only 13minutes to make his statement. He spoke of Mahoney's ``so-calledfriends'' who plied him with beer before the crash.   Baldani said Mahoney was extremely fatigued on the day of thecrash and therefore more sensitive to a small amount of alcohol.``The truth will lead you to a very simple conclusion: LarryMahoney is not a murderer,'' he said.   Sixty-nine people, representing 29 victims' families, jammed theCarroll County Courthouse for the opening of Mahoney's trial on 82criminal charges, including 27 counts of murder.   ``Seeing Mr. Mahoney in person, I think it's going to be astressful event for all of us,'' said William Nichols, whose onlychild, 17-year-old William Jr., died aboard the bus.   ``Mr. Mahoney has his whole family'' at the courthouse, Nicholssaid. ``My wife and I are representing my son.''   Mahoney waived his right to be present on the jury's trip.   At the warehouse, jurors milled around both wrecked vehicles,some stopping to peer inside. Several seemed interested in thespace that held the bus' fuel tank, which exploded upon impact.Federal investigators concluded that the tank was punctured by oneof the bus' leaf springs, causing the explosion.   All the victims _ 24 children and teen-agers, and three adults _died of smoke inhalation, not crash injuries. Forty others escapedthrough windows or the bus' rear door, but many were severelyinjured.   Mahoney's lawyers plan to base his defense on the bus, whichthey allege was inherently unsafe. The prosecution contends the bussafety issue is incidental and that the collision was due solely toMahoney's drunken driving.   ``This wasn't an accident,'' said Mickie Muller, whose daughterKatrina survived with disfiguring burns. ``This was a man who choseto drink, who chose to get into a car.''   Bus safety ``has nothing to do with this issue,'' Williams said.``Murder is the issue, drunk driving. We need to concentrate onthat.''</TEXT></DOC>
