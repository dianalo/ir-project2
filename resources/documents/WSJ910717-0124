First, America's political cultureand general cultural values are critical factors indetermining public policy. Present and future U.S. healthpolicies are usually anchored in the past. Mr. Marmoroverlooked the fact that Americans may not be like Canadians,Germans and others in accepting and using the health-caresystem, and may also have a different outlook on the role ofgovernment in social policy. This isn't to say we can't learnfrom the experiences of other countries, but a look aroundthe world provides no ready-made answer to how America'ssystem should be modified. While assessments of variousnational health insurance programs will vary depending on thecriteria for success, few Americans will defend any of themas offering a full range of solutions to U.S. health-policyproblems.   Second, Mr. Marmor gives short shrift to the growingproblems of elective surgical and specialized services innational medical-care systems. For instance, in Canada, ashortage of specialized physicians and nurses is making itincreasingly difficult to care for certain severely illpatients. Few Canadian physicians specialize in the care ofpremature infants -- Canada is graduating only nineneonatologists this year. The growing number of infants bornas early as 24 to 26 weeks and weighing only about a poundsuggests this will become a severe problem. The popularity ofin vitro fertilization will compound the problem, because invitro patients tend to have multiple births oflow-birth-weight infants. These access problems are notsilly, as Mr. Marmor would like us to believe, and shouldremind analysts that there are serious consequences for thequantity, range and quality of services in national systems.</LP><TEXT>   Third, the fact that the health systems of all othercountries are less expensive than the U.S.'s should not betaken as a tribute to the other systems' ability to controlthe rate of growth of health-care spending. While it isprudent to interpret trends cautiously, analysis ofper-capita health spending from 1970 to 1989 suggests growthwas faster in most other advanced countries than in the U.S.From 1980 to 1989, Canada and France had growth rates higherthan the U.S. To some extent, the higher costs in the U.S.compared with other countries may really reflect socialfactors -- such as poor housing and nutrition of selectedpopulations, poor social and financial support to familieswith pregnant women, and substance abuse -- rather than wasteand inefficiency.   Fourth, few health-care systems are genuinelydecentralized, as Mr. Marmor characterizes Canada's andGermany's. Canada's provinces and Germany's various insurershave much less discretion in health care than Mr. Marmorclaims. The result is substantial uniformity of allprovincial insurance plans in the case of Canada and ofinsurers in the case of Germany, so that the systems in thosecountries are almost as much national systems as Britain'sNational Health Service.   John B. Crosby   Senior Vice President   Health Policy Development   American Medical Association   Chicago   ---   Mr. Marmor's is the best short piece I have read on theundeniable difficulties with this extraordinarily importantand expensive industry. He addresses the major problems,identifies some of what we might learn from the experience ofothers, and meets the major objections -- particularly tolessons from Canadian experience -- with convincingcounterarguments.   By contrast, Leroy Schwartz's commentary on &quot;The MedicalCosts of America's Social Ills&quot; (editorial page, June 24)takes no account of Mr. Marmor's rebuttal. Mr. Schwartz makesthe unexceptionable case that America's social ills --criminal violence, crack babies, and the like -- contributeto our ill health. But he follows with two non sequitors: IfCanada, Germany or Sweden had our social problems they wouldhave &quot;much worse&quot; sickness rates and &quot;much higher&quot;health-care costs. Here is a qualitative argument posing as aquantitative trump. Certainly more sickness would mean moresickness. But does anyone know what the cost differenceswould be? As Mr. Marmor noted, Canada already has morehospital bed days and more physician visits per capita peryear. It is much more plausible that our cost differencesarise from the inflated prices we pay for medical care thanthe volume of care our undeniable social ills help to&quot;inflate.&quot;   The rest of Mr. Schwartz's article explores the othernonsequitor: First we should clear up our social ills. &quot;Onlythen can we avoid the rationing to the poor, the elderly andthe middle class that is often characteristic of the nationalhealth-care models it is suggested we adopt.&quot; Notice thefactless character of this claim and the leap from socialills to the necessary conditions for avoiding rationing.Presumably, Mr. Schwartz had proposals like Mr. Marmor's inmind when he wrote. Your readers, however, have the right todemand arguments, not vague innuendo.   Richard H.
