After the coup by dissident military elements was put down Friday, Mrs. Aquino indicated she is finally taking a tough stance. She vowed &quot;no terms for traitors&quot; and ordered the arrest of the soldiers who she said not only attempted to take over the government but wanted to kill her and her family in the process. But Philippine political analysts said she has to follow up her words with actions if she is to avoid more takeover attempts, cope with a growing communist insurgency and improve a stagnant economy straining under the huge foreign debt and widespread corruption her regime inherited from Ferdinand Marcos.    Perhaps most important, the political observers said, Mrs. Aquino must overcome her penchant for indecisiveness, which has allowed dissension and bickering to continue within her government -- whittling away what support the government had gained from the popular uprising that overthrew Mr. Marcos's 15 years of one-man rule in February 1986.    Before the coup, the Aquino government had &quot;lost the momentum&quot; that brought it into power, said Amando Doronila, editor of the Manila Chronicle and one of the country's most respected journalists. The government's inadequacies are &quot;now coming to roost,&quot; he said.    Officials said at least 25 people died and 275 were injured, most of them civilians, when as many as 1,200 mutinous soldiers attacked the presidential compound in Manila, key military bases and the government broadcast center. Mrs. Aquino's son was shot, but not seriously wounded, after he identified himself to some of the rebels. The rebels also acted at camps in the central Philippines and took control of regional military headquarters in Cebu, the nation's second-largest city.    Although the attacks were led by a former aide to Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, Col. Gregorio Honasan, Mr. Enrile denied he had any part in the uprising. Mr. Enrile, then the defense minister, and Gen. Fidel Ramos, the armed forces chief, led the military uprising that forced Mr. Marcos from office. Mrs. Aquino fired Mr. Enrile as defense minister in November, following a previous coup attempt by his followers. Mr. Ramos led the successful crushing of the coup attempts, including the latest.    Analysts warned that sympathizers of the aborted coup remain in the military. The possibility of another takeover attempt is &quot;definitely not over,&quot; said Randy David, director of the University of the Philippines' Center for Third World Studies. &quot;I expect it to happen again.&quot;    Mr. David warned that the military gains influence with each coup attempt, no matter which side wins. Friday's events &quot;make her much more a captive of the loyal military,&quot; he said.    In addition, the country's economic recovery, especially new investment, could be hindered. Government and private economists have predicted that the country's gross national product, the total value of goods and services, will grow almost 6% this year after four years of stagnation. &quot;I'm sure a lot of investors will do a certain amount of rethinking,&quot; said George Uy-Tioco, president of the brokerage firm First Pacific Securities Philippines Inc.    A foreign banker added that the attempt &quot;was a real body blow to this economy. It's hard to think of a worse thing that could have happened.&quot;    Although the coup was launched in the first few hours of Friday, it wasn't until Mrs. Aquino ordered an all-out assault on rebel positions Friday afternoon that it began to crumble in Manila. Some coup supporters in the provinces held out into the weekend.    The Aquino regime treated participants of past coup attempts with kid gloves. After the first bid to seize power in July 1986 by military supporters of the deposed President Marcos, Chief of Staff Ramos ordered 30 push-ups for the rebel soldiers. &quot;We had the ironic situation when every time there was an attempted coup, the government wouldn't acknowledge it,&quot; said Mr. David.    This emboldened the dissidents, who appeared to expect Friday's attempt to be met by the same vacillation and weakness, analysts said. Rebel soldiers seemed ill-prepared for the strong counteroffensive. And this time, more than 800 officers and men have been arrested; most are being held on two navy ships docked in Manila.    Mrs. Aquino was praised for her toughness. &quot;She finally put her foot down and this was appreciated by a lot of Filipinos,&quot; Mr. Uy-Tioco said.    The attempted takeover came two days after a strike protesting an increase in petroleum prices closed down much of Manila. The strike occurred even though the government, in another example of indecisiveness, had partially rolled back the price increase the day before the mass action took place. It was one of the strongest indications yet that the Aquino government was losing popularity. But the arrested coup attempt bolstered the government's standing, many analysts believe, at least for the time being.    &quot;After all this is over, the question of high prices, the old discontent caused by a worsening standard of living, remain,&quot; said historian Renato Constantino.    Yet some economists believe the country still can pull out of its four-year slump. &quot;I still see close to a 6% increase (in GNP) this year and more the next,&quot; said economist Bernado Villegas of the private Center for Research and Communication. Even before the coup attempt, many prospective investors weren't prepared to take the plunge before the middle of next year, he said. &quot;Of course, a lot of things can happen between now and the end of the year.&quot;    On Friday morning, a spokesman for the rebel soldiers said over one of the captured television stations that the coup was prompted by a civilian and military leadership vacuum. The spokesman, a young lieutenant, said the coup was an attempt to break &quot;the vicious cycle of overindulgence in politics.&quot;    Disillusionment within the military remains. Some soldiers believe the Aquino government contains leftist-oriented advisers and remains &quot;soft&quot; on the growing communist insurgency. A committee to investigate alleged human-rights violations by the military has worsened morale. The rank-and-file are poorly paid, poorly trained and poorly equipped.    Democracy isn't a concept that gets automatic support in the Philippines. Many of the soldiers who participated in the coup attempts were young children when President Marcos abolished democracy and declared martial law in September 1972, giving the military increased power. Only in July did a freely elected Congress resume sitting. Immediately, the kind of seemingly endless debate that characterized Congress before martial law started anew. &quot;We're undergoing a transition,&quot; said Sen. Raul Manglapus. &quot;It takes some time.&quot;    &quot;There's a race against time to stabilize civilian institutions for democracy,&quot; said the University of the Philippines' Mr. David. &quot;In the minds of ordinary people we appear helpless before the military. That's very bad.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
