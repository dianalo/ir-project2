But this time they were praising God for the return of a7th-century Koran, a gift from the Uzbekistan government.   There also have been protests that have taken on a more politicalor ethnic character, reflecting other influences.   Ethnic resentment between Uzbekis and Meskhi Turks, who wereforcibly resettled to eastern Uzbekistan's Fergana Valley by Stalinin 1944, exploded in early June. Scores of people died and hundredsof houses were torched. Thousands of Meskhis were evacuated toprotect them, but even then the 9,000 Interior Ministry soldierssent in had difficulty keeping order.   Bands of young people frustrated with high prices and consumershortages rioted in two cities of the Turkmen republic borderingIran at the beginning of May.   On April 9, Tashkent sources said, several thousand peoplerallied to support Belik, an informal political group seeking toestablish Uzbek as the republic's official language and calling fordrastic measures to improve the environment. Belik means ``unity''in the Uzbek language.   In Central Asia, as in the Baltic republics and Armenia, thedeteriorating environment has become a rallying point that hasopened up broader issues such as economic reform and demands formore local control.   Gafkha Namatova, a Belik spokeswoman, said the group claims100,000 members. It supports Gorbachev's reforms, she said, but ``wesee a lot that we like'' in the programs of the People's Frontgrassroots organizations that have sprung up in the Baltics andelsewhere.   National policies demanding cotton production in Central Asiahave led to food shortages, she said. Abuse of farm chemicals onthose same cotton fields has increased infant mortality, she charged.   In an interview with the Soviet government newspaper Izvestia inMarch, the republic's new president, Mirzaolim Izragimov, saidcotton-growing must be de-emphasized.   The policy of pushing marginal land into production ruined 1.73million acres of pasture, he said.   Drainage of rivers that flow into the Aral Sea, on the border ofUzbekistan and Kazakhstan, has lowered the level of the sea and madeit one of the Soviet Union's top environmental concerns.   Many of the policies and practices now being repudiated inCentral Asia are associated with former President Leonid I. Brezhnevand his supporters.   But experience has shown the danger of replacing local officials,ignoring ethnic feelings.   In 1986, riots broke out in Alma Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan,following the replacement of the republic's party leader DinmukhamedKunaev by Gennady Kolbin. Kunaev, an ethnic Kazakh, was a Politburomember and a close associate of Brezhnev. Kolbin is a Russian.   Brezhnev's son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov, was sentenced to 12 yearsin a labor camp last December after being convicted of acceptingmore than $145,000 from Uzbekistan officials.   Mamayusupov pledged religious leaders would become more sociallyactive, fighting bribery, alcoholism and prostitution.   Attacks on those social ills are not likely to bring him intoconflict with the Kremlin, but Moslem leaders could run intodifficulty with local authorities if they launch a seriousanti-corruption campaign.   ``Moslems intend to struggle very actively in the socialsphere,'' he said, adding that ecology is the first target.   While some civil discontent is organized openly through Belik andsimilar organizations, the religious discontent remains largelyhidden.   An underground group calling itself Islam and Democracy claimedcredit for the protests that ousted Babakhan, but it since hassplintered.   Almaz Estekov, the 33-year-old chairman, preaches the need for astrengthening of Islam as well as establishment of Western-stylecivil liberties.   But he said Islam and Democracy ultimately cannot cooperate withBelik because of the latter's secular views.   The influence of Khomeini's Iran may be limited. The vastmajority of Soviet Moslems are Sunnis, while Shiites are dominant inIran. The two sects have deep historic differences.   Mamayusupov said the traditions of Soviet Moslems are strongenough that they will not be carried away by attempts to export aradical Islamic movement from Iran or Afghanistan.   ``We have our own view and our own foundation,'' he says. ``Wecan influence others, but others cannot influence us.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 11</NOTE></DOC>
