The market showed little inclination to respond either to stability in the dollar, which had plunged Wednesday and dragged down stocks as well, or news that the October producer price index was unchanged.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.55 to 2114.69 as just 128,920,000 shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, well below Wednesday's 153,140,000.    The low volume was coupled with increasing pessimism on the part of investors, suggesting that the malaise that has dominated the market for much of the year is starting to resurface. &quot;This market seems to be in something of a rut,&quot; said Trude Latimer, a market strategist at Josephthal andamp; Co.    Prices firmed at the opening and again in the final hour of trading, but ultimately were unable to rebound from Wednesday's slump, in which the Dow Jones industrials dropped 9.25 points.    Broader market averages fared somewhat better than the 30-stock index. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index gained 0.36 to 273.69, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose 0.15 to 257.28 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 0.17 to 154.09.    Advancing and declining issues were about even on the Big Board throughout the session as the market drifted without direction. At the close, 715 issues were higher in price, while 666 were lower.    Traders said the growing disenchantment among investors was actually encouraging, as it creates the potential for stocks to benefit eventually from a change for the better in market psychology.    &quot;People are a little uneasy,&quot; said Rodd Anderson, a vice president of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton. &quot;It's probably a good sign that some of the optimism is coming out (of the market) and some of the froth is coming out too.&quot;    The market's pessimism is in part due to fears of a possible move by the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates to keep economic growth in check.    Josephthal's Ms. Latimer suggested that the market needs further reassurance that the economy isn't expanding at a pace that would prompt the central bank to push rates higher. &quot;There's no question in my mind that the market is responding to those statistics which affect interest rates,&quot; she said.    Carmine Grigoli, a portfolio strategist at First Boston, said uncertainty about the economy and rates could lead to further sluggishness in the market during the next few weeks. &quot;Investors are just confused and don't really know if the economy's going to be too weak or too strong,&quot; he said.    Mr. Grigoli added that any strength in the market over the next six to 12 months will have to come from takeover activity, which he expects to continue at a brisk pace as long as stock prices don't rise rapidly and the economy doesn't fall into a recession.    Stocks of Texas-based construction companies rallied in response to the Energy Department's selection of the state as the site for the proposed $4.4 billion super collider, a 53-mile tunnel that would be used for nuclear research. Texas Industries, which has a cement plant near the site, surged 2 1/2 to 32; its 80%-owned Chaparral Steel unit climbed 1 3/8 to 12 3/8, and Centex rose 1 1/4 to 27 3/8.    Allegheny Ludlum jumped 2 1/4 to 34 1/4. The company declared a special dividend of $3.50 a share and boosted its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 12 cents, its second increase this year.    Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, the newest member of the Sandamp;P 500, added 1 to 26 7/8 in Big Board composite trading of 1.9 million shares. The company was added to the index at the close of trading Wednesday.    Golden Nugget advanced 1 to 15 1/8 in trading that included a block of 990,000 shares, representing 4.9% of its shares outstanding. Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. confirmed that it handled the block trade but declined further comment.    West Point-Pepperell added 2 3/8 to 42 1/2 as investors awaited a ruling in the company's lawsuit to block Farley Inc. from carrying out its $48-a-share tender offer. The advance was also tied to reports of favorable comments on Pepperell from C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell.    Toro, cited in the past as a possible acquisition candidate, added 1 3/4 to 20 7/8. Traders said there weren't any fresh rumors to account for the advance.    TW Services dropped 1/2 to 24 3/4. The company's board recommended that shareholders not tender their shares to Coniston Partners, which is seeking a controlling stake in TW through a $29-a-share tender offer.    Ocean Drilling andamp; Exploration, which said it is studying various restructuring options, went up 5/8 to 14 in active trading.    C3 Inc. gained 7/8 to 12 3/4. Knoll Capital Management said it plans a $14-a-share tender offer for the company, which previously rejected its bid of $13 a share.    In the oil sector, British Petroleum rose 5/8 to 54 3/8, Royal Dutch Petroleum added 1 to 112 5/8 and Shell Transport andamp; Trading gained 5/8 to 70 5/8. Third-quarter results at both BP and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group were on the high end of analysts' expectations.    Squibb rose 1 7/8 to 68 1/2 as the company hosted a meeting with analysts to discuss its earnings outlook and prospects for development of new drugs, among other things. Details from the meeting weren't immediately available.    Furr's/Bishop's Cafeterias gained 1 1/8 to 8 3/8 on news that Chairman Michael J. Levenson is considering a possible takeover offer for the partnership. Last week, Furr's/Bishop's said it was considering a recapitalization.    The American Stock Exchange Index added 0.59 to 294.63. Volume was 8,690,000 shares.    Resorts International Class A rose 1/2 to 34 3/4. The Bahamas gaming board approved Merv Griffin's acquisition of the company, removing one of the deal's last regulatory hurdles.    Larizza Industries tumbled 2 1/4 to 9 1/2 after reporting sharply lower third-quarter earnings.    B.B. Real Estate Investment Corp. added 3/8 to 3 7/8. The company launched a $32 million offer to acquire California Real Estate Investment Trust of San Francisco, which rose 1/4 to 6 1/8 on the Big Board. </TEXT></DOC>
