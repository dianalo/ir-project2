At a securities analysts meeting in New York yesterday, Stanley said it acquired Acme Holding Corp., a San Dimas, Calif.-based maker of door hardware. The company said it also purchased Plan-A-Flex Designer Co. in a separate transaction. Plan-A-Flex is a maker of remodeling and home design kits, based in New Orleans.    Terms weren't disclosed, but Stanley officials said the transactions were stock swaps.    The hardware and tool manufacturer, based in New Britain, Conn., said the acquisitions will help strengthen its position in the do-it-yourself market.    Acme Holding had sales of more than $50 million last year, Stanley said. Sales of Plan-A-Flex weren't disclosed.    Donald W. Davis, chairman and chief executive officer, declined to be more specific about his projection of record 1987 profit and sales, but said orders were up &quot;dramatically&quot; in January and February over a year ago.    In 1986, the company had net income of $77.9 million, or $1.84 a share, on revenue of $1.37 billion, compared with $70.2 million, or $1.70 a share, on revenue of $1.01 billion the year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
