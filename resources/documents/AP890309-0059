Students left the building by 4 a.m. after receiving a letterfrom university officials promising they will not be punished forparticipating in the action, said Michael Lewis, a spokesman for theCoalition for Concerned Students.   The officials also agreed to work on improvements to financialaid and curriculum at the predominantly black university, Lewis said.   ``You stood up and said `we have an insult level,' and Howard hasestablished a watershed movement,'' civil rights leader JesseJackson told the students as the takeover ended.   Jackson, Mayor Marion Barry Jr. and Walter Fauntroy, the Districtof Columbia's delegate to Congress, met into the early-morning hourswith the students.   Jackson called the outcome ``a great victory.''   He said the students had two major interests. ``On one hand, theywere concerned about being a part of the political process on thecampus, which (university) president (James) Cheek agreed to in avery amicable way, and also they were concerned about the politicsof the (Bush) administration. They want an end to race-consciouspolitics.''   Lewis said some students remained in the building today to repairany damage that was caused during the occupation, which began Mondayas students protested Atwater's appointment to the board of trustees.   Atwater resigned Tuesday, saying he was worried the occupationmight lead to injuries of students.   After learning they had succeeded in driving Atwater from theboard of trustees, the students focused their attention on otherdemands involving curriculum, financial aid and improved security.   The demonstration disrupted classes and the students on Wednesdayblocked the entrance of a site they thought was being used fortemporary administrative offices.   Atwater was appointed to the board in December. Students startedthe protest on Friday when they disrupted a convocation ceremony forthe school's charter day that was to have included a speech bycomedian and philanthropist Bill Cosby.   The students recommended that Cosby be named to replace Atwater.   Atwater complained Wednesday that he was the victim of an``unfair portrayal'' of his civil rights positions by Howardstudents.   ``All I was trying to do was help Howard University,'' Atwatersaid. ``The president of the school knew that _ the board oftrustees knew, and I think some of the students knew.''   Students contended that Atwater encouraged racism while managingPresident Bush's 1988 campaign by focusing on convict Willie HortonJr., who is black. Horton raped a Maryland woman while on furloughfrom a Massachusetts prison.   Jackson thanked Cheek for the way he handled the demonstration.``These struggles to make life better don't always end on this note.Many students have been expelled to make their point and that didn'thappen at Howard,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
