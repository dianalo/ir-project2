The time-densitycurve (TDC) was evaluated for its usefulness in analyzing brain bloodcirculation (dynamics). Such other parameters as peak time (PT), meantransit time (MTT), and mode of transit time (MOTT) were also assessed.Particular attention was paid to high convexity, watershed, and perforatorareas of the middle cerebral artery, which are regions of interest inthe bilateral hemispheres. The dynamics of blood circulation demonstratedby this method were compared with those demonstrated by single photonemission computed tomography (SPECT). In patients with carotid arterystenosis, the TDC at the convexity area on the affected side showed botha gentle upward slope and a slow downward slope, and all parameters (PT,MTT, MOTT) were prolonged. After endarterectomy, the delay in all parametersdecreased and the laterality of the TDC diminished. In patients withmiddle cerebral artery occlusion, the TDC at the convexity area on theaffected side showed delay of attenuation, and all parameters were prolonged.After superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis,the peak on the operated side was higher than that on the unaffectedside and prolongation of MTT and MOTT on the affected side was decreased.In cases of moyamoya disease, none of the parameters could be calculatedbecause the TDC showed no downward slope. In all of the evaluable cases,TDC data were superior to SPECT determinations in detecting lateralityof the circulation. These results indicate that this method accuratelydemonstrates laterality of circulation time and volume as well as thedegree of collateral circulation. The TDC and other parameters appearuseful in determining whether or not surgery is indicated and in estimatingthe postoperative circulation in patients with ischemic disease.</TEXT></DOC>
