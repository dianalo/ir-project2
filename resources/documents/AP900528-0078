No more turtle steaks, turtle eggs that locals favor asaphrodisiacs or turtle shells for combs, computer boards and vanitycases.   Turtle skin exports to Japan for shoes, belts and handbags areover.   Under pressure from environmental groups, President CarlosSalinas de Gortari signed an executive order declaring an end toMexico's turtle industry, probably the world's largest.   Until Monday, the country was the world's leading exporter ofturtle products, but environmentalists say sea turtles are beinghunted to extinction here. Mexico is home to 10 of the world's 11species of sea turtles, and nine of them lay eggs and nest on itsbeaches.   Salinas signed the ban at a ceremony Monday in the capital'shistoric Chapultepec Castle in the presence of environmentalistsfrom the world over, governors whose states are involved withturtles, and fishing industry leaders.   ``In signing this decree, we are taking a definite step to helpthis species continue its biological developments, ... threatenedwith extinction because its natural habitat has been considerablyreduced,'' Salinas said.   The government will close all turtle slaughterhouses and providemoney to help turtle fishermen and their families diversify.   Todd Steiner of Earth Island Institute said Salinas had receivedmore than 70,000 letters in six months protesting lack ofprotection for turtles.   Steiner said environmentalists talked of declaring a tourismboycott on Mexico and about 10,000 Americans signed a petitionsaying they would not visit Mexico unless protective laws werepassed.   Environmentalists on Monday praised the ban but said the testwill come in enforcing it. They said Mexico also must join the107-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Speciesof Flora and Fauna, known as CITES.   Every country in the Western Hemisphere except Mexico has signedthe accord, which bars trade in endangered species. Mexico isJapan's biggest supplier of turtle skins, and Japan is the world'sbiggest importer of turtle products.   Japan joined CITES, but excluded turtle products.   Steiner said his organization was happy with Monday's ban thatwas aimed at stopping ``what was the largest killing of anendangered species occurring anywhere in the world.''   ``But we will be monitoring the situation closely to make surethese wonderful words are fully implemented,'' he said.   Michael Weber, vice president of the Center for MarineConservation in Washington, said the ban could help the OliveRidley turtles, which nest on the Pacific coast, recover fromdecades of exploitation.   Weber said environmentalists are also urging Mexico to requireuse of turtle excluder devices in shrimp nets.   ``They say it's going to end the killing. We hope it's going toend the killing,'' said Andrew Davis, a spokesman for GreenpeaceInternational.   But he said enforcement could be difficult on the isolated,remote beaches where turtles lay their eggs.   Most eggs are laid on the Pacific beaches of the states ofOaxaca, Michoacan, Guererro and Jalisco.   Last year, the government set a quota of 20,000 turtles but morethan 35,000 were killed at the state-owned turtle slaughterhouse inOaxaca state and 40,000 others clandestinely, Earth IslandInstitute said.   The biggest slaughter was of Pacific Olive Ridley turtles, whoseskins were sold to Japan. Hawksbill turtles were killed in theCaribbean for tortoise shell.   The Kemp's Ridley, whose population has plunged from 100,000 to300 in two decades, has its main nesting ground at Rancho Nuevo, innortheastern Tamaulipas state on the Gulf of Mexico.   Because so many were killed, much of the meat was wasted,Elisabeth Robinson Gunther, also of Earth Island, said.   Protection programs sponsored by ecological organizations andthe government have been rescuing eggs, caring for them until theyhatch and releasing the young turtles into the sea.   Turtle soup, eggs and steaks are popular local foods but withMonday's measure would themselves become banned.</TEXT></DOC>
