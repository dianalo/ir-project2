Secretary of State James A. Baker said he had ``a productiveexchange of views'' with Arens at the State Department before theIsraeli official went to the White House to see President Bush.   Baker said he had suggested ``various reinforcing and reciprocalsteps'' be taken by Israel and Palestinian Arabs, who make up theoverwhelming majority in the territories captured by Israel in the1967 Mideast war.   But Baker did not say whether Arens had agreed to relax Israeliauthority and to take other measures floated before his arrival innewspaper accounts.   Arens told reporters that Israel wanted to reduce tensions, but``it's not easy to do that with violence in the area.''   For 15 months, Palestinian Arabs have waged a campaign againstIsraeli authority. In the violence, 396 Arabs and 17 Israelis havedied.   ``We both agreed that the need for progress is of the highestpriority,'' Baker said as he saw Arens off to the White House.   Despite pressures from Arab and Western European governments, theBush administration is moving slowly in formulating a plan forMideast peace talks.   ``It's just basically common sense that before you do anythingthat you could consider an initiative, you've got to change theconditions and lower the level of violence and confrontation,'' aU.S. official, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said Sunday.   Bush has said he won't be stampeded into offering wide-rangingnew peace initiatives in his talks with Middle East leaders. Arenswill be followed here later this spring by Israeli Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir and there also will be visits by Jordan's KingHussein and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.   Bush has kept open the U.S. dialogue with the PalestineLiberation Organization, although administration officials haveexpressed concern about recent attacks by Palestinian guerrillasagainst Israeli soldiers.   Both U.S. and Israeli officials seem content to use this week'stalks to buy time before moving more heavily into the complexproblems of Mideast peacemaking.   Arens, who is making his first trip to the United States asforeign minister, has characterized the meetings as get-to-know-yousessions rather than a substantive discussion of peacemakingstrategy.   U.S. officials plan to ask Israel to release some of thePalestinians arrested during the 15-month uprising, end or limitdetentions and reopen schools in the territories, The New York Timesreported Sunday, quoting an unidentified senior administrationofficial.   It said the U.S. initiatives also would call on the PLO to haltviolent demonstrations in the Israeli-occupied territories, blockanti-Israeli raids from southern Lebanon and stop distribution ofinflammatory leaflets.   The administration official said the aim of the Americansuggestions to both Israel and to the PLO are to bring about``confidence-building measures on both sides because the Israelisand Palestinians really don't trust each other.''   The aim would be to have such suggestions ``grabbed by one side,and then have that attract the other,'' he said. ``It's not really aplan.''   But in advance of today's meetings, Palestinian leaders attendinga Mideast peace symposium in New York denounced the administrationideas for calming tensions in the region.   They called on the administration to push instead for a permanentsolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, including creation of anindependent Palestinian state.   Several left-wing Israeli legislators attending the three-daysymposium at Columbia University also predicted that the U.S.proposals would fail if they included only interim measures forquelling the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   But Yossi Sarid, a member of the left-wing Citizens RightsMovement in Israel's Knesset, or parliament, said the Bush proposals``show at least that the new administration has a sense of urgency''about restarting the Mideast peace process.   Faisal Husseini, director of the Arab Studies Center in EastJerusalem and a top Palestinian leader in the occupied territories,called the U.S. suggestions ``unbalanced, unfair.''   He said the new U.S. proposals were flawed because ``they areasking us to stop the demonstrations,'' while Israel was being asked``the minimum.''   Husseini and PLO officials at the symposium said the real issueis ending Israel's occupation of the territories, captured fromJordan and Egypt during the 1967 Middle East war, and creating aPalestinian state.   ``The intefadeh (the Arabic name for the uprising) is our onlyweapon for continuing the peace plan,'' said Nabil Shaath, chairmanof the Political Committee of the Palestine National Council, thePLO's legislative arm. ``What is not negotiable is the final result:an independent Palestinian state side-by-side with the state ofIsrael.''</TEXT></DOC>
