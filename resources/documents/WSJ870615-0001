The most memorable footage showed the pilot leaning out of his cockpit window, at Beirut airport, with a pistol held at his head.    But an equally compelling drama was quietly unfolding behind the scenes.    A day after the hijacking began, Italian air-traffic controllers were stunned to see a blip representing another TWA jet disappear from their radar scopes. They feared a crash, not knowing that a complicated exercise in deception was being executed by TWA and high U.S. government officials. In order to simulate a disappearance, the TWA pilot being dispatched to the scene had deliberately switched off the radio beacon signaling his position. Then he turned his jet toward a rendezvous with an American commando force.    TWA and the commandos were to jointly prepare an assault on the hijacked jet to free its hostage passengers and capture -- or kill -- their captors. To enhance the mission's secrecy, a TWA executive says, &quot;We made our plane over Italy disappear into thin air.&quot;    The assault plan, which eventually had to be aborted, is one of many details that have gone unreported until now despite the wide coverage the hijacking received. Many details remain classified secrets.    But TWA has carefully documented its own role in the effort to end the hijacking, in which one American passenger was killed. The airline's internal report, supplemented by interviews with many airline and government officials, offers a case study of airline behavior in a hijacking. Details of a two-year, world-wide manhunt for the hijackers are also just now beginning to emerge.    To some extent, the tale is one of misadventure. Diplomats thought negotiations in Algiers would end the hijacking after three or four days. Thus, State Department officials badly wanted to keep the plane there. Their wish was frustrated. The hijackers bluffed their way out of Algiers by faking the screams of a tortured &quot;victim&quot; to extort needed fuel. Then, John Testrake, the captain of the hijacked jet, deliberately feigned engine failures to ground the jet at Beirut -- the last place that TWA and U.S. officials wanted it. Finally, some of the traps later set for the hijackers were sprung on empty air.    The TWA episode also shows the anguish experienced by airline executives when events halfway around the world spin out of their control and unthinkable horror suddenly invades their working day. While one TWA passenger was being savagely beaten in Beirut, for example, the plane's radio was left on and the transmission was recorded. Hours later, TWA executives in New York listened to the recording, including the victim's screams.    &quot;It was a nightmare,&quot; says C.E. Meyer, who was the president of TWA at the time. &quot;The whole thing was a nightmare.&quot;    Day One: Friday   Shortly after taking off from Athens that morning with 145 passengers bound for Rome, Capt. Testrake heard pounding on the door to the cockpit of the Boeing 727. Two men burst in, one with a chrome-plated pistol, the other with hand grenades, both screaming in Arabic. One also spoke fluent German, and a flight attendant translated the German into English for the pilots.    The hijackers first wanted to go to Algiers. Told that there wasn't enough fuel, they demanded Cairo, then Beirut. Capt. Testrake headed for the Lebanese city. Before the day ended, the plane would hopscotch to Beirut, to Algiers and back to Beirut.    During moments when the two hijackers ran back into the passenger cabin, the crew radioed air-traffic controllers of their plight. In New York, it was about 3 a.m. when Mr. Meyer's wife handed him the phone and TWA's operations control center told him of the hijacking. Mr. Meyer had other troubles at the time, being embroiled in a bruising battle with Carl Icahn for control of TWA -- a battle that Mr. Icahn would win months later.    &quot;We were pretty groggy from dealing with Carl, and now this,&quot; Mr. Meyer recalls. He and several other TWA executives headed for TWA's Manhattan headquarters in the early-morning darkness.    One of their first tasks was to set up an intelligence network to help plot the plane's destination. TWA flew neither to Beirut nor to Algiers. But Richard Kenny, then TWA's senior vice president for flight operations, got a call from a friend, a U.S. oil-company man, who happened to know the chief of a jet-fuel company in Beirut. Mr. Kenny telephoned the fuel-company executive in Beirut; as the days passed, the executive would report how much fuel had been pumped aboard the hijacked plane. This helped TWA calculate the range of the plane and, by elimination, where it might fly next. (In Algiers, Air France officials also passed along fuel data to TWA.)    TWA relayed its intelligence to Washington, where the State Department began marshaling promises of assistance from the governments of countries where it guessed the plane might land. Pentagon officials used the TWA data to calculate where an assault on the hijacked plane might be feasible.    (President Reagan, according to a former White House aide, wanted to &quot;go after&quot; the hijackers if there was a good opportunity. Shortly after the hijacking ended, the president said while testing a microphone before a speech: &quot;Boy, I'm glad I saw 'Rambo' last night -- now I know what to do next time.&quot;)    When the hijacked jet first arrived in Beirut, the hijackers began issuing threats and demands by radio to the tower.    TWA pilot: He says if he doesn't get enough fuel in three minutes he's going to kill an American he's got tied up here in the cockpit.    Tower: I'm doing my best, I'm doing my utmost, sir. . . . Would you please advise the hijackers to take it easy?    The hijackers' principal political demand was freedom for 766 captives, mostly Moslem Shiites, first detained by Israeli forces in southern Lebanon. The Shiites had been taken to a prison in Israel, in violation of the Geneva convention, according to the U.S. (although Israel denied any violation).    After it was refueled, the plane flew to Algiers and then back to Beirut, where things began to unravel. One hijacker, about 20 years old, grabbed the cockpit microphone. He was a member of Hezbollah, a group of radical Shiite Moslems in Lebanon, and he began asking for help from Amal, a larger and more moderate Shiite Moslem group there.    At first the tower suggested he speak with the head of still another Lebanese faction. &quot;Is this a trick to delay us?&quot; the hijacker asked in Arabic. Then a car approaching the TWA jet frightened the hijacker. &quot;What is this car, what is this car?&quot; he asked, his voice rising.    The car crept closer. (To this day, it isn't known what the car was doing there.) Screaming into the microphone, the hijacker warned that the plane was booby-trapped with bombs. &quot;In a minute we will start killing passengers and throwing them out the windows.&quot;    The hijacker wheeled, snapping orders to a comrade, according to a confidential report Capt. Testrake later prepared for TWA executives.    &quot;The other hijacker opened the left front door,&quot; Capt. Testrake reported, &quot;and I saw him drag the still-bound {American} serviceman to his feet and push him into the open doorway. A single pistol shot sounded and the man's body fell to the pavement below.&quot; Robert Stethem, a Navy diver, had been shot to death.    Shortly afterward, several additional hijackers climbed aboard, apparently including Amal members. Night settled over Beirut airport.    Day Two: Saturday   At dawn, the TWA jet took off once again for Algiers. In New York, where it was about 1 a.m. and TWA executives were maintaining a round-the-clock vigil, some officials were on the edge of despair.    Hearing reports that the plane was again aloft, &quot;we would say to ourselves, 'Oh my God, here we go again,'&quot; recalls Jerry Cosley, a TWA vice president at the time. &quot;We were hoping the hijackers would get tired and run out of gas,&quot; says Mr. Meyer, the TWA president, &quot;but then we heard more hijackers were aboard -- a relief crew -- which was devastating, because it meant this thing could go on forever.&quot;    In Algiers, however, the situation brightened. An Olympic Airways jet flew there with a third hijacker, who had missed the TWA flight and had been arrested in Athens after the flight departed. He was bused out to the hijacked jet, and several Greek passengers were released in return.    Algerian officials used this event to strike a deal with the hijackers. They promised that the plane wouldn't be stormed, and troops ringing the airport were withdrawn. The hijackers promised in return that hostages wouldn't be harmed while the plane was there. Some passengers had been released during the previous stops in Beirut and Algiers, and as negotiations continued Saturday, more passengers were released. Finally, only the three-man TWA flight crew and 36 American men remained.    Peter McHugh, TWA's top European executive, had leased a private jet in London to fly to Algiers airport to help. &quot;The tension was dropping dramatically,&quot; he says. The new Amal hijackers, &quot;dressed up in designer fatigues, were calmer, easier to deal with,&quot; he adds. Michael Newlin, the U.S. ambassador to Algeria who also was at the airport, says: &quot;The Algerians were doing an excellent job of negotiating.&quot;    Some diplomats even held out hope that Sunday would bring the release of all remaining hostages.    At the same time, however, contingency plans for a very different resolution -- an assault on the hijacked plane -- were under way. In the U.S., the Delta Force, an Army commando group trained to storm a plane and shoot hijackers within seconds, had been alerted. The U.S. Emergency Support Team was in the air, heading for the Mediterranean. This dozen-member team included terrorism experts from the State Department, the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency and a psychiatrist expert in hostage negotiations. This team, it was hoped, could stall the hijackers through negotiations while also serving as an advance guard for a Delta Force raid.    A federal official had phoned TWA asking to borrow a TWA jet for the Delta Force. Airlines lay out their cabins differently, and Delta Force sharpshooters needed to practice with TWA's exact layout before bursting into the hijacked plane.    The borrowed jet would also serve as a Trojan horse of sorts. If a big U.S. military plane roared into Algiers airport, the hijackers would suspect it was carrying an assault team. The TWA plane, ostensibly on a routine commercial flight, would quietly smuggle the Delta Force into the airport so the hijackers could be taken by surprise.    Mr. Kenny, the TWA vice president who took the call requesting a plane, turned for advice to Mr. Meyer, the TWA president. &quot;Meyer turned white,&quot; Mr. Kenny recalls, &quot;and he said, 'If they storm our plane, a lot of people may die.'&quot; But the airline agreed to lend a jet.    The Emergency Support Team, the Delta Force and the borrowed TWA jet all were to rendezvous at Sigonella, a U.S. Navy air base near Catania in Sicily. As the borrowed TWA jet flew over Italy, the pilot turned off its radio beacon, wheeled and headed for Sigonella.    (Several TWA workers in Europe, unaware of the secret plans, thought when the radar blip disappeared that a second TWA plane had been hijacked. One called New York headquarters to sound the alarm, but was told not to worry.)    As night fell, U.S. and TWA officials were hoping the hijacked jet would remain in Algiers, not only because of the Algerians' negotiating skills but also because Beirut's warring factions would complicate negotiations there. In addition, they felt any assault on the plane had a much better chance of success in Algiers.    &quot;Beirut's airport was surrounded by hostile militias, the passengers might be dispersed around the city, and any rescue would become impossible,&quot; a U.S. official says.    Day Three: Sunday   In Algiers, as dawn broke Sunday, all was quiet. The TWA jet was parked at the far end of the main runway.    Suddenly, however, the TWA jet's radio crackled with a call to the tower. &quot;They wanted fuel -- immediately -- or they were going to kill all the passengers and blow up the plane,&quot; says Mr. McHugh of TWA.    A U.S. embassy man monitoring the TWA jet's radio heard the call for fuel and flashed word to Washington, where it was about midnight. Secretary of State George Shultz phoned the Algerian foreign minister with a plea to block the plane's takeoff.    At Algiers airport, the tower begged the hijackers to remain. Government trucks drove onto the runway, blocking it. Mr. McHugh, on top of the terminal with his binoculars trained on the parked plane, heard a transmission from the TWA jet on his portable radio. This time there were screams of a passenger apparently being tortured. &quot;It just scared hell out of me,&quot; says Mr. McHugh.    The Algerians also heard it. Within minutes fuel was made available and obstacles to takeoff were removed. &quot;We didn't want anyone killed,&quot; says an Algerian diplomat. The TWA jet roared down the runway, once again heading for Beirut.    (The screams had been faked. According to Capt. Testrake, in a book he has co-written, the hijackers said they wanted to play &quot;a little game&quot; to persuade the airport to deliver fuel. One pistol-wielding hijacker told a passenger to scream into the microphone. When that wasn't loud enough to suit the hijacker, co-pilot Philip Maresca began screaming.)    A series of snafus, meanwhile, had made an assault on the plane impossible. The Italian government, then more tolerant of Mideastern extremists than it is now, had delayed giving permission for U.S. use of its base at Sigonella. &quot;They stonewalled us for hours and days,&quot; says a former White House official. This made Delta Force late in arriving at Sigonella.    Algierian officials, moreover, made it plain they wouldn't tolerate any U.S. attack occurring on their soil. &quot;If Delta Force flew into Algiers, the Algerian army would have surrounded the plane and immobilized them,&quot; one U.S. diplomat says. Even the small U.S. Emergency Support Team had trouble getting into Algiers. The Algerians wouldn't allow a military jet to land, so the team members had to fly scheduled airlines. To make connections, they had to fly from Sicily up to Marseille in France and then back down to Algiers. They arrived hours after the TWA jet had departed. &quot;It was a study in frustration,&quot; one team member says.    Though Beirut was the last place U.S. and TWA officials wanted the hijacked jet, Capt. Testrake decided that was where he was going to stay. He had heard the hijackers murmuring about Tehran, which seemed even less desirable, and was growing increasingly edgy about flying without maintenance. Thus, he and other crew members contrived to simulate engine failures.    In his later report to TWA, the captain said that Benjamin Zimmerman, the flight engineer, laid the groundwork. As the plane approached Beirut, Mr. Zimmerman &quot;used the remaining time in descent to paint a frightening picture for the hijackers of immediate pending multiple engine failure.&quot;    The jet touched down. &quot;As soon as I came out of reverse {thrust},&quot; Capt. Testrake stated, warning lights and gongs signaled that two of the jet's three engines were flaming out. &quot;We all made much commotion and alarm over each 'failure,'&quot; the captain said. &quot;I later moved the airplane around the airport using No. 1 {engine} alone to further emphasize our crippled condition.&quot;    The jet stayed at Beirut airport for the duration of the hijacking. The remaining passengers were dispersed around the city, making a rescue raid impossible.    The Next Two Weeks   Officials in Washington began negotiating with the Lebanese Amal group and also with the Syrians. &quot;There was a lot of jawboning,&quot; says Robert Oakley, then in the State Department and now a White House aide.    As days dragged by, TWA began getting crank calls offering to free the hostages. A man calling himself &quot;Hank&quot; told a TWA official, &quot;The president's not going to do anything, he's a wimp.&quot; Hank added, &quot;There's two of us that's willing to go over there and get your passengers off that damn plane. We are both ex-Marines.&quot; He requested two automatic rifles, 500 rounds of ammunition, and round-trip tickets.    At last, on Sunday, June 30, the TWA hostages were bused from Beirut to Damascus, and then flown home. Soon afterward, Israel released the 766 Lebanese detainees.    At this point, TWA wanted to recover its $9 million plane, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation wanted to catch the hijackers. The State Department gave TWA little help, TWA executives say. &quot;Nobody cared about our airplane,&quot; says Richard Pearson, then TWA's executive vice president. &quot;So we had to smuggle it back.&quot;    TWA put out a call for volunteers among its senior pilots. &quot;Before we knew it, we had nearly 75 guys who wanted to go&quot; on the dangerous mission, Mr. Pearson says.    A three-man crew was selected, and one day in August the volunteers flew to Beirut as passengers on Middle East Airlines. Within 44 minutes the crew checked the TWA plane, taxied to a runway heading over the sea (to avoid antiaircraft guns near another runway), and without any takeoff clearance roared off.    Fearing that the jet may have been booby-trapped with bombs that could be triggered by changes in air pressure, the pilot flew the 123 miles to Larnaca, Cyprus, at low altitude, with the cabin unpressurized. There, an inspection ruled out any bombs. But it was discovered that someone had shot a bullet through the tail during the takeoff from Beirut.    Then a fight broke out between TWA and the FBI. The FBI wanted immediate access to the plane to check for fingerprints and other evidence. TWA insisted on moving the plane to a more secure airport, preferably in the U.S. A top FBI official in Washington, Oliver Revell, got into an argument on the phone with Mr. Kenny in his office in New York.    &quot;The FBI told Kenny they would come up to his office, arrest him and prosecute him for obstruction of justice,&quot; says a former federal official. (Mr. Kenny confirms the conversation. Mr. Revell says it &quot;wasn't all that heated.&quot;)    In the end, they compromised. TWA flew the plane to Rome, and the FBI examined the jet there.    To Catch a Hijacker   The FBI identified the three hijackers plus a fourth man who directed the operation. A federal indictment unsealed in Washington last January says the German-speaking hijacker was one Mohammed Hamadei.    &quot;We knew Hamadei had lived in West Germany,&quot; one U.S. official says, &quot;that he had a brother who still lived there, and that one day he would probably return there.&quot; The U.S. official says FBI and CIA agents worked with West German intelligence men, who apparently put Mr. Hamadei's brother and many of his friends under surveillance. For a year and a half, the West Germans waited.    Meanwhile, traps laid for the planner of the hijacking, who hasn't been named publicly, have failed. U.S. intelligence officials thought they had located him just outside Paris, but he fled before French officials would take action, one former U.S. official says. Later, when police raided a room in a Paris hotel where U.S. officials had traced the man, they found that &quot;instead of a 28-year-old Lebanese, it was a very surprised 50-year-old Spaniard,&quot; a U.S. official says.    When Mr. Hamadei finally returned to West Germany last January, he was arrested at the Frankfurt airport, with the aid of police dogs trained to smell explosives. Three wine bottles he was carrying turned out to be full of explosive liquids. Two weeks later, his brother Abbas was arrested when he returned to Frankfurt. Police found five gallons of the same explosive in a field near his home.    The story isn't over. Two West German businessmen have been kidnapped in Beirut, apparently by associates of the Hamadei brothers. The West German government now faces a dilemma. It can either put Mohammed Hamadei on trial or extradite him to the U.S. for trial (and thereby risk the lives of the West German businessmen) or swap him for the businessmen.    For those who lived through it, the hijacking of Flight 847 is a slowly fading nightmare. Many of the executives involved have since left TWA -- some forced out by Mr. Icahn's new team, some departing voluntarily for other airlines. Capt. Testrake is still flying for TWA. Beyond the emotional havoc wrought by the terrorists, the hijacking triggered a barrage of trip cancellations in the succeeding months, costing the airline an estimated $75 million in lost revenue.    ---                    Terrorism at Airports DATE     INCIDENT                LOCATION       CASUALTIES 3/26/77  Waiting room explosion  Canary Islands  8 injured 4/23/77  Locker room explosion   Washington,     1 dead                                   D.C. 5/29/77  Baggage area explosion  Istanbul        5 dead,                                                  24 injured 3/26/78  Extremists riot         Narita, Tokyo   78 injured 5/20/78  Machine gun attack      Paris           2 dead,                                                  5 injured  4/3/79  Machine gun and         Brussels        17 injured           grenade attack 7/29/79  Baggage area explosion  Madrid          1 dead,                                                  9 injured 6/12/80  Locker explosion        Paris           8 injured 2/24/81  Machine gun attack      Rome            5 injured 5/16/81  Terminal explosion      New York        1 dead  2/8/82  Explosion under         Miraflores,     1 dead,           aircraft               Colombia        4 injured 7/17/82  Terminal explosion      Brazzaville,    3 dead,                                  Congo           16 injured 7/31/82  Waiting room explosion  Munich          7 injured  8/7/82  Machine gun attack      Ankara          9 dead,                                                  71 injured 7/15/83  Suitcase explosion      Paris           7 dead,                                                  56 injured  4/8/84  Shooting incident       Las Vegas       1 dead,                                                  2 injured 4/20/84  Baggage area explosion  London          25 injured  8/2/84  Suitcase explosion      Madras          40 dead,                                                  19 injured 8/31/84  Departure lounge        Kabul           27 dead,           explosion                             200 injured 12/27/85 Terrorist attacks       Rome and        17 dead,                                   Vienna        120 injured  9/5/86  Attack against Pan Am   Karachi         22 dead,           aircraft                             100+ injured    ---            HIJACKINGS AND BOMBINGS OF AIRCRAFT Date      Incident                        Casualties 10/16/77  Air Djibouti ground attack      2 dead, 2 injured  12/4/77  Malaysian Airlines           hijacking -- crashed            93 dead  8/18/78  Philippines Airlines explosion  1 dead, 1 injured   9/3/78  Air Rhodesia ground/air           missile attack                  48 dead  2/12/79  Air Rhodesia ground/air           missile attack                  59 dead  4/26/79  Indian Airlines explosion       8 injured 11/15/79  American Airlines explosion     0 injured   9/9/80  United Airlines explosion       2 injured 10/13/81  Air Malta explosion             2 dead, 8 injured  2/12/81  Aeronica explosion              5 injured  8/11/82  Pan Am explosion                1 dead, 20 injured  9/11/83  Korean airline shot down        269 dead  9/23/83  Gulf Air explosion              112 dead  1/18/84  Air France explosion            0 injured  3/10/84  Union Des Transport explosion   24 injured  6/14/85  TWA Hijacking                   1 dead  6/23/85  Air India explosion             329 dead 11/23/85  Egypt Air hijacking             60 dead,                                           35 injured   4/2/86  TWA explosion                   4 dead, 9 injured   Source: Federal Aviation Administration</TEXT></DOC>
