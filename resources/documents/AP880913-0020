And I will not nag at him for eating candy bars,ice cream and cookies.''   The bride clutched fake flowers and sported gold tinsel hair,twinkling gold eyelashes and size 18 shoes.   Before the vows, Chubby Cheeks, trembling from matrimonialjitters, tried to make a run for it.   ``My mother cooks better than her!'' he shouted as he tried towobble to freedom in his white baggy pants and oversized shoes.   He was headed off and returned to the side of his bride, wherehe said: ``I take Sparkles to be my lawful-wedded wife, I promisenot to eat peanut butter and cookies before going to bed, I willhelp with the housework, I promise to take out the garbage and hangup my clothes every night, and I promise to visit her relativeswithout any argument whatsoever.''

Palm Beach Milk Co. plans to start home deliveries of milk andother dairy products this fall with milkmen who have undergonepolice background checks.   ``We're giving people a comfort level, saying, `These guys areOK.
