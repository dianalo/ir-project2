As some 2,400 out of 16,000 UAW workers at Caterpillarstruck the company, neither side budged from its position onthe crucial issue of whether Caterpillar should follow theagreement negotiated last month between the union and Deere andamp;Co.</LP><TEXT>   That left little hope for a quick settlement, and nofurther negotiations were scheduled as of late yesterday.   &quot;We believe that Caterpillar products would not becompetitive if we accept a pattern agreement,&quot; said aspokesman for the Peoria, Ill., company. The retort from aunion negotiator: &quot;We're in for a big fight until they changethat way of thinking.&quot;   How the matter is resolved carries implications beyondCaterpillar and its workers. If the company succeeds ingetting a better deal than Deere, that increases thelikelihood that other companies, including Detroit's automakers, would try to break from the long tradition of patternbargaining.   Pattern bargaining has allowed the union to negotiategains at one company and then extend them to others in theindustry so that none gets a big advantage in labor costs. Aunion spokesman noted that Caterpillar has been profitable inthe past after negotiating such agreements with the UAW.   Caterpillar maintains that it needs a separate anddifferent agreement to make it competitive internationally. Aspokesman says that Caterpillar competes with Deere on justsix out of 38 models that Caterpillar makes, and competeswith Japanese or non-union plants on many other models.   As the union threatened Sunday, some 2,000 UAW members inDecatur, Ill., and another 400 at a plant in East Peoria,Ill., participated in the limited strike. AlthoughCaterpillar faces generally soft demand for its products,union officials said many workers at those two locations hadbeen working overtime to fill orders.   Company spokesmen said exports account for more than halfthe production at the plants. Products such as hugetracktype, or crawler, tractors made in East Peoria areespecially popular overseas, as are off-highway trucks androad graders made in Decatur.   For now, the company said it is abiding by the expiredcontract and &quot;evaluating alternatives.&quot; Although the companydidn't say so, those alternatives include temporarily closingother plants or laying off some of their workers.   The union wasn't ruling out extending the strike to otherlocations. For the moment, however, the limited strike savesmoney. The UAW is paying strike benefits of $100 a week-pluscontinued health care and life insurance coverage-out of its$800 million strike fund.   The UAW's contract with Deere, of Moline, Ill., calls fora general wage increase of 3% in the first year and lump-sumpayments of 3% in each of the next two years, along withcontinued cost-of-living coverage. Among other things, thetwo sides also agreed to improvements in profit-sharing andjob security plans for workers.</TEXT></DOC>
