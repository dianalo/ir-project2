The important features were:The transcription efficiency can be calculated by some experimental dataand modeling. The plausibility of the genetically structured model canbe tested. Some important parameters for autogenous control on the levelof the whole cell can be studied as a function of the specific proteinaccumulation. However, to utilize this approach effectively, many biochemicaland genetic parameters will have to be determined experimentally.</TEXT></DOC>
