The appeal by the organization was made in a report presented tothe European Parliament. The report was aimed at the EEC because thetrade bloc is the largest consumer of tropical hardwood, importingmore than one-third of the world's annual production.   The report noted that within 80 years there would be no undamagedtropical forest if current rates of deforestation continue.   The most urgent need is to increase funds to protect and managethese forests, the report said, urging the EEC to set aside $520million for this.   Chris Elliott, the World Wildlife Fund's tropical forest expert,said the funds could be used to increase protected areas of tropicalforests, train more forest rangers, and compensate timber producingcountries for lost revenue.   The group called on the EEC to introduce ``substantialinitiatives on debt relief to take financial pressure off developingcountries,'' which depend on timber exports.   Elliott said countries ``mine tropical forests to pay offinterest on their debt.'' He suggested these countries should beencouraged to view their forests ``as a renewable resource.''   The major exporters of tropical timber to the EEC, based on 1984figures, were Gabon, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Liberia, Congo, Ghana,Philippines, Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, according tothe report.   The World Wildlife Fund, founded 28 years ago and based inSwitzerland, is the world's largest private conservationorganization. Its aim is to conserve the natural environment andecological processes essential to life on earth.   Sometimes called the ``lungs of the Earth,'' tropical forests actas a natural pollution filter by absorbing carbon dioxide andproducing oxygen. If carbon dioxide isn't removed from theatmosphere, it can trap heat there, which some scientists saycontributes to a global warming trend called the ``greenhouseeffect.''</TEXT></DOC>
