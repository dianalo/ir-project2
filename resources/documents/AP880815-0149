(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic presidential nominee MichaelDukakis on Monday dismissed President Reagan's criticism of him asa ``liberal, liberal, liberal,'' saying Republicans have turnedtheir backs on basic American values and that ``the `L' word inthis campaign is leadership.''   The Massachusetts governor, on his annual visit to the centralpart of his home state, said he was not fazed by criticism of himat the Republican National Convention and predicted Reagan'spersonal popularity would not help certain Republican nomineeGeorge Bush.   ``In the last analysis, people are going to be looking at me andMr. Bush and they are going to be looking at which one of us hasthe leadership,'' Dukakis told reporters. He noted that Reagancampaigned actively for GOP Senate candidates in 1986 but could notkeep Democrats from regaining control of the Senate.   Dukakis talked with reporters after attending an event to markthe first phase in implementing the state's universal health carelaw, which guarantees health insurance to virtually all workers by1990.   On arriving in New Orleans on Sunday, Reagan said: ``It's timeto talk issues, to use the dreaded `L' word. To say the policies ofour opposition and the congressional leadership of his party areliberal, liberal, liberal.'' He also accused the Democrats ofstealing the theme of family values that Reagan said had helpedfuel the Republican resurgence.   Dukakis said he does not think such criticism of him will causelasting political damage.   ``The `L' word in this campaign is leadership,'' Dukakis said.``This isn't about the past. It's not about the '70s or the '30s.It's about the '90s. ...The `L' word is leadership. That's why I'mrunning for president.''   Dukakis used the health-care event to tout his record asMassachusetts governor on issues that affect the family, citing hiswork to expand opportunities for day care and affordable housing aswell.   He called basic health care ``a birthright of every American''and added: ``That's something the Republican party has neverunderstood.''   Dukakis said he could not provide a figure of how much such aprogram would cost on a national level but said he hoped most of itcould be financed through minor increases in insurance premiumswith the possibility of using government money to get the programrolling That is the case in Massachusetts, where $65 million hasbeen allocated for the first two years.   At Monday's event with Dukakis were several disabled people whowill get health insurance through the new program _ allowingseveral of them to work for the first time.   The central Massachusetts trip is an annual event for Dukakis,who will return to the region Tuesday. He recited hisadministration's efforts to bring the region back from an economicdepression and said he wasn't sure if he would be back next year.   ``Fate will tell us in a little less than three months,'' hesaid.   After the luncheon and health-care event, Dukakis toured ametals factory in Westboro before returning home for the night.   The governor issued a statement calling for a Cabinet-levelcouncil to oversee the nation's space program and said he wouldsupport deployment of a permanently manned space station.   At the news conference, Dukakis said the startup money for thestation _ which aides said would be about $900 million in the firstyear _ would be taken from cuts in some weapons programs and frommore efficient Pentagon management.   Dukakis endorsed the space station for the first time as hisrunning mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, toured the Johnson SpaceFlight Center in Houston.   Dukakis also continued to blame Reagan for the increase in theprime interest rate to 10 percent, saying the higher lending rateresulted from Reagan's continued ``borrowing and spending,borrowing and spending, borrowing and spending.''   Dukakis is scheduled to be in his home state through Wednesday,when he will begin a campaign trip to Minnesota, Alabama, Florida,Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas and Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
