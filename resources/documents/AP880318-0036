The meetings with Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh's staffbegan Thursday, a day after a federal grand jury indicted Lt. Col.Oliver North, former national security adviser John Poindexter andtwo arms dealers. All four were involved in the diversion ofprofits from Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.   Israel is seeking immunity from prosecution for four Israelisinvolved in the sale of U.S. anti-tank missiles to Iran in 1985 and1986, said an Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Walsh, in turn, wants records of Israeli transactions with Northand the two indicted arms dealers, Richard Secord and Albert Hakim,the official said.   Yossi Gal, a spokesman for the Israeli Embassy, said a meetingtoday was aimed at ``finding an acceptable solution for cooperationbetween the two governments.''   Israel is seeking immunity for Amiram Nir, a Israelianti-terrorism official; David Kimche, the former foreign ministrydirector; and businessmen Yaacov Nimrodi and Al Schwimmer. Allworked with North on the Iran arms sales.   Gal also said that Rafael Vardi, a retired Israeli general whocompiled a chronology of Israel's role in the arms sales to Iran,met with Walsh on Thursday. Several Israeli lawyers accompaniedhim, according to the Israeli official who spoke anonymously.   Elyakim Rubinstein, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister YitzhakShamir, is expected to join Vardi today for talks with Walsh'sstaff, Gal said.   Rubinstein, who has been in the United States with Shamir fordiscussions on a Middle East peace plan, also will meet with Reaganadministration officials about the case, Gal said. He refused todiscuss the meetings further.   James Wieghart, Walsh's spokesman, said he knew nothing of themeetings but confirmed that Walsh has been negotiating with theIsraelis for a long time about access to the records on the Swissaccounts.   The Israeli official who spoke on condition he remain anonymoussaid Walsh is seeking bank account records to corroborate otherevidence about Israel's transactions with North, Secord and Hakim.   Walsh angered Israel last year by issuing subpoenas against Nir,Kimche, Nimrodi and Schwimmer, meaning they could be arrested ifthey visited the United States and refused to testify.   Under pressure from the United States, Rubinstein and Vardicompiled classified historical and financial chronologies that wereprovided to the congressional Iran-Contra committees last year. Thedocuments detailed the role Israel played in shipping U.S. missilesto Iran as part of a plan to secure freedom for American hostagesin Lebanon.   During the congressional hearings, Israel refused to allow thefour Israelis involved in the arms sales to testify, but agreed tolet Vardi answer questions. The congressional panels did not callVardi, saying they were satisfied with the written chronologies.</TEXT></DOC>
