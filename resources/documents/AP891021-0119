The breakthroughs were disclosed one day before the finalscheduled session of the fractured Lebanese parliament in Taif,where Moslem and Christian lawmakers have been meeting in an effortto settle their 14-year-old civil war.   The lawmakers would next meet in Lebanon to formerly implementany plan reached Sunday.   One source close to the talks, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said ``differences of opinion'' surfaced in theChristian camp during a meeting Saturday afternoon.   Conference sources said that before debate began on the thornyissue of the Syrian military presence, the Christians accepted aproposal to expand the 99-seat Parliament by 29 members to allowMoslems equal legislative powers.   That was one of the key points of political reform suggested ina four-chapter peace plan drafted by an Arab League committee tosettle the war.   Sixty-three of Parliament's 73 surviving members have beenstudying the draft peace accord since Sept. 30.   A second session of the Christian legislators was set for 11p.m. and was expected to continue well into the night, the sourcessaid.   They said the Christian deputies would confer by telephone witharmy commander Gen. Michel Aoun and militia chieftain Samir Geageain Beirut, and with Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir atthe Vatican.   Although the 33 Christians and 30 Moslems meeting in Taifclashed on a number of issues in the original draft, the problemthat nearly collapsed the talks was the chapter on Syrian troops.   The original draft suggested a gradual withdrawal from Beirutinto east Lebanon's Bekaa valley in two years, without committingDamascus to a total evacuation from the country after that.   Christians insisted on a fixed timetable for a quick withdrawalfrom all of Lebanon, and Moslems argued that the Syrian presence istheir only guarantee for implementation of political reforms.   Moslems, who make up 55 percent of the 4 million population,want an equal share of power with the Christians, who havedominated the government, Parliament, army and judiciary sinceindependence from France in 1943.   The compromise, worked out by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saudal-Faisal during a two-day visit to Damascus this week, was notdisclosed.   But sources said Damascus agreed to it.   They said it fell short of the Christians' demand for awithdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops from Lebanon in less than threeyears.   They said Syria agreed that its troops pull out of a.6-mile-radius ``security zone'' around the Parliament before thechamber meets in formal sessions to ratify political changes andelect a new president.   The Syrians would be replaced by Lebanese police backed byAlgerian and Moroccan observers, the sources said.   Lebanon has been without a head of state since Sept. 22, 1988,when President Amin Gemayel's term ended with Parliament unable tomeet to elect a successor.   Whether Syria accepted the Christian demand that the Syrianpresence in the Bekaa does not exceed one year remained unclear.   Conference sources said Syria refused a specific timetable forthe Bekaa withdrawal, instead proposing it be worked out by a jointSyrian-Lebanese military committee after political reforms areratified, a president is elected and a unified government is formed.   Conference sources said there were minor changes in legalisticterms in the formulation of the draft that the Christians sought.   The sources quoted Faisal as telling the Christian deputies thatthe concessions he got from Damascus were the ``maximum'' Syria wasprepared to agree to.   The sources said that as a guarantee to the Christians, Faisalsuggested the 22-member Arab League, which gave theSaudi-Moroccan-Algerian committee six months from May to find asettlement in Lebanon, extend this mandate to two years to overseefull implementation of the accord.</TEXT></DOC>
