In 1988, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services barredfamily planning clinics from suggesting abortion as an option topregnancy. It specifically prohibits use of federal money forprograms that assist women in obtaining abortions. It also bans theuse of funding for activities that ``encourage, promote or advocateabortion.''   The regulation is on hold while Massachusetts, New York andColorado wage court battles against it, claiming it violatesconstitutional rights of privacy and free speech.   ``These regulations suppress one viewpoint but foist on patientsanother viewpoint _ that she should carry that pregnancy to term,''Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon argued Tuesday beforethe 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. ``What we're talking abouthere is government manipulating information.''   He presented a scenario in which poor, uneducated, pregnantwomen leave a family planning clinic believing they must continuetheir pregnancy with no alternative.   ``The government doesn't have to subsidize a constitutionalright (to abortion), but it can't interfere with these rights,''Shannon said.   Arguments Tuesday invoked both the 1973 Supreme Court decisionin Roe vs. Wade that abortion is a woman's right to decide and theso-called Webster case in July that said a state can deny fundingfor abortions.   Justice Department counsel Alfred Mollin, arguing for Health andHuman Services, said Webster established ``it is wrong for thegovernment to place an obstacle, but not wrong to leave an obstaclethere.''   Mollin contended that the regulations are not as prohibitive asthey seem.   They don't prevent a clinic staff from at least saying theydon't make abortion referrals, he said. He also said a physiciancan still refer a woman for an abortion if the pregnancy risks herlife or health.   ``The tone of the regulations are not to set up an anti-abortionadvocacy group,'' Mollin said.   The matter has already been before the court in Boston. In May,three judges of the 1st Circuit ruled in favor of the state,upholding an injunction blocking the ban on referrals from takingeffect.   But when the Supreme Court handed down the Webster decision twomonths later, the federal government asked the 1st Circuit torehear the arguments in this new light.   Elsewhere, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New YorkCity upheld the regulations last month.   A ruling is pending on an appeal of the regulations in federalcourt in Denver on behalf of Planned Parenthood affiliates.   This fiscal year, the federal government is spending $138million to provide family planning services to 5 million teen-agersand women.   ``This case is the only one that is national in scope,'' saidScott Swirling, executive director of the National Family Planningand Reproductive Health Association based in Washington, D.C. ``Theoutcome will determine whether poor women can get complete amountsof information (about abortion).   ``This case doesn't concern the legality of abortion, but untiland unless the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, abortion is alegal and constitutional right.''</TEXT></DOC>
