The commission voted 5-0 to phase out current rules thatrestrict the trading of particular options to only one exchange.Beginning Jan. 22, 1990, new options can be traded on more than oneexchange. As of Jan. 21, 1991, existing options will be open forcompetition.   The unanimous vote came despite what commission membersacknowledged was heavy lobbying by the exchanges for a delay.   After 12 years of study and consideration, ``the time has comefor the Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt a rule thatwill move this process forward,'' SEC Chairman David S. Ruder said.   Stock options give the buyer the right to purchase or sell stockby a specific date at a designated price. Big institutionalinvestors such as pension funds and insurance companies use optionsto hedge their portfolios, protecting them against unexpected priceswings. Individual investors sometimes speculate with options.   Since 1980, the lucrative and exclusive right to trade newoptions on exchange-listed stocks has been awarded through alottery. Option contracts on Texaco stock, for instance, are tradedonly on the American Stock Exchange and options on IBM stock aretraded exclusively on the Chicago Board of Options Exchange.   However, since 1985 exchanges have competed against one anotherin trading options on over-the-counter stocks, a much smallermarket than options for exchange-listed stocks.   The SEC staff argues that competition has worked well foroptions on over-the-counter stocks and similar competition foroptions on exchange-listed stocks would allow customers to use theexchange that does a more efficient and less costly job of managingtrading.   The National Association of Securities Dealers favors thechange, but most exchanges express varying degrees of reservation.Regional exchanges such as the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and thePacific Stock Exchange fear they will lose business to largercompetitors. But even a larger market such as the American StockExchange, which favors multiple listing, argued for a more cautiousapproach.   Ivers Riley, senior executive vice president at the AmericanStock Exchange, said the SEC should have authorized multiplelisting only of new options. Opening up multiple trading of optionsalready assigned to one exchange could prove to be too costly anddisruptive for the exchanges at this time, he said.   But, Richard G. Ketchum, SEC director of market regulation, saidhe did not expect the new rules to produce dramatic shifts. He saidit would be difficult for an exchange to wrest trading of anestablished option away from the exchange that now trades it.   Ketchum argued that multiple trading will give brokerage firmsthe leverage with exchanges to win more favorable trading terms fortheir customers.   Also, it will give the exchanges the incentive to develop anintegrated electronic system that will allow brokers to routeoptions business to whichever exchange is offering the best priceat the moment, he said. The SEC is issuing a ``white paper'' withadvice on how to put together such a system and is invitingresponses from the industry.   Depending on the prospects for developing an integrated system,commission member Mary Schapiro said she would consider requeststhis fall for delaying the start multiple options trading.   Nicholas A. Giordano, president of the Philadelphia StockExchange, said he feared multiple options trading without anintegrated system would hurt customers by making it impossible toobtain the best price, which he said could be assured if an optionwas traded on a single exchange.   He said members of congressional committees with oversight ofthe SEC share his concern and he might ask them to hold hearings onthe matter.   And, noting that President Bush this summer will likely replacea majority of the five-member SEC, Giordano said Thursday's SECvote was ``tantamount to throwing a grenade into a room andleaving.''</TEXT></DOC>
