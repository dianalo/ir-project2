So far, it's done little but look.    All NHTSA has to show for its efforts is a 1984 requirement that such vehicles, which are designed for use both on and off the road, prominently display labels warning that they don't handle the same as cars and could roll over in certain maneuvers.    Only last summer, a recommendation by top agency officials about setting federal rollover standards was vetoed by Diane Steed, NHTSA's administrator, according to recently obtained internal agency documents. (NHTSA declines to comment on grounds that the matter involves private agency discussions.)    Amid all the inactivity, however, complaint about the problem is mounting -- as is evidence. Documents have lately come to light indicating that engineers at American Motors Corp. itself, whose Jeep has been the centerpiece of NHTSA's investigations, have raised questions about the stability and safety of certain Jeep models.    The failure to do more about the rollover problem is &quot;one of the great travesties of auto safety,&quot; says Benjamin Kelley, a former federal auto-safety official who is now president of the Institute for Injury Reduction, a research group founded by plaintiffs' lawyers.    Adding urgency to the issue is the fact that utility vehicles are among the hottest automotive sellers now, claiming about 6% of the market, up from less than 2% a decade ago. Currently, there are some five million utility vehicles on the road.    A recent NHTSA study estimates that such vehicles are involved in rollover accidents two to three times more frequently than passenger cars. Moreover, while 24% of all deaths in cars occur in rollovers, the rate is 66% in utility vehicles. This represented more than 600 fatalities in 1986, with thousands more injured.    Several vehicles have drawn criticism. For example, NHTSA recently received a petition from the Center for Auto Safety, a private Washington-based watchdog group, requesting a defect investigation into the Suzuki Samurai, a hot-selling new utility vehicle from Japan. Suzuki Motor Co.'s U.S. sales arm strenuously denies any stability problem.    And a study released earlier this month by Leon Robertson, a private researcher, suggests that Ford Motor Co.'s Bronco II and General Motors Corp.'s S-10 Blazer and Jimmy utility vehicles, have relatively high rollover rates. A GM spokeswoman says the company hasn't reviewed the study but adds that the two vehicles meet all applicable federal safety standards; a Ford spokesman says the Bronco II is a &quot;well-designed&quot; and safe vehicle.    NHTSA's main focus, however, has been the most famous -- and to some, the worst -- alleged tumbler: the Jeep. Though the models most suspected of problems, the CJ-5 and CJ-7, went out of production in 1986, about 450,000 are still in use, and they remain at the center of the rollover dispute.    Indeed, Jeep CJ's were specifically mentioned as a possible target for recall in the petition from Sen. Timothy Wirth (D., Colo.) that prompted NHTSA's deliberations last summer. Besides asking for minimum stability standards for all new utility vehicles, Sen. Wirth wanted the agency to look at recalling older vehicles that didn't meet the standard.    Four major NHTSA departments, including the one for rule making, favored granting the Wirth petition, the internal agency documents show. Even after Ms. Steed's decision, the research-and-development department continued arguing within the agency for the measures.    Over the years, American Motors, which was purchased last year by Chrysler Corp., has vigorously defended the Jeep as safe and, like other auto makers, argued against such efforts to set federal rollover standards.    But internal American Motors documents -- including memos, charts and meeting minutes -- cast doubt on the company's safety claims. Some of these documents have been used in a handful of the more than 1,000 Jeep rollover lawsuits to date.    While Chrysler officials discount the importance of the documents, they agree that Jeeps and other utility vehicles tend to be less stable than standard automobiles. Since a utility vehicle has to be able to go over rocks and through gullies, it is relatively narrow and sits high off the ground. As with any object, the higher the center of gravity and the narrower the base, the easier it is to tip over.    But the stability difference is small and doesn't really matter, auto-company officials contend. &quot;In the typical accident, there is more than enough energy to roll over any vehicle,&quot; says James Thornton, a former director of Jeep engineering.    Chrysler officials add that the rollover statistics for utility vehicles may be skewed by factors that have nothing to do with design. Jeeps, they argue, may be driven in places and in ways that expose them to more rollover risks. Due to insufficient data, &quot;a valid rollover study can't be done,&quot; asserts Kent Joscelyn, a Chrysler attorney.    These officials deride as &quot;junk science&quot; the Jeep testing done by critics, in which rollovers have occurred at speeds as low as 22 miles an hour. The tests are run under artificial conditions that don't occur in the real world, company officials maintain.    American Motors in 1981 hired an outside contractor to put Jeeps through some maneuvering tests. The contractor concluded the Jeeps weren't susceptible to rollovers unless subjected to steering manuevers that &quot;greatly exceed&quot; those used by &quot;average drivers.&quot;    Yet in those tests, a Jeep rolled onto its side while taking a turn at about 22 miles an hour-confirmation, critics say, of its instability. Kenneth Gluckman, a Chrysler assistant general counsel, dismisses that mishap as a case where the driver &quot;just steered quickly and was going too fast,&quot; and says the same result could have occurred with other vehicles.    More damaging to the Jeep's defense, though, were discussions going on inside American Motors.    Among the documents that have surfaced in lawsuits is one written in 1979 by American Motors' department of advanced vehicle engineering, citing &quot;deficiencies to be corrected&quot; in the CJ-5 and CJ-7. Topping the list are &quot;handling, stability, rollover characteristics.&quot; In another 1979 memo, Dennis Renneker, then the department's director, wrote that the CJ-7 would &quot;probably roll over quite easily&quot; in a test in which the typical car would just skid.    Mr. Renneker also wrote in the same year that the Jeep CJ-7 failed to meet the &quot;true safe design limit&quot; against rollovers. Mr. Renneker recommended giving the vehicles a wider track and a lower center of gravity. &quot;While not a cure for rollover, I believe (this) would make a significant improvement,&quot; he wrote.    Another major area where private records conflict with public pronouncements involves the roll bars installed on open-top CJ's to keep passengers from being crushed in rollovers. Chrysler officials say Jeep roll bars are so strong that they offer more protection than a car roof.    As long ago as 1973, however, doubts about Jeep roll bars were being raised within the company. In a memo recently obtained by this newspaper, D.C. Mallett, an American Motors safety engineer, wrote to the director of Jeep engineering at the time that the &quot;integrity&quot; of the roll bars &quot;appears to be questionable&quot; and &quot;doesn't appear to meet Jeep engineering requirements.&quot;    Mr. Mallett asked for testing to &quot;establish that the roll bar will provide a customer the protection he thinks he is buying and, in fact, will not cause further severe injury.&quot; Roll-bar integrity was also on the 1979 &quot;deficiencies to be corrected&quot; list.    Perhaps most telling were some 1980 maneuvering tests of the CJ-5. American Motors acknowledges that it decided the version being sold to the public didn't offer enough protection for the test driver in the event of a rollover. So it added reinforcements to the roll bar and window frame of the test vehicles. Critics say the company didn't make significant stability and crash-protection improvements in production models until 1986, when it replaced the CJ series with a new vehicle, the Wrangler.    The internal documents apparently have begun costing Chrysler. In 1986, a jury in St. Lucie County (Fla.) State Court, which saw some of the documents mentioned above, awarded $19.5 million to a 29-year-old woman who was left quadriplegic after a rollover accident. Chrysler appealed, but earlier this month it settled the case for $11.5 million.    In another 1986 rollover case, heard in Santa Clara County (Calif.) State Court, attorney David Rude says internal company documents were &quot;critical&quot; to his winning a $550,000 verdict for his clients. &quot;They established to the point of overkill that the company knew it had a serious rollover problem,&quot; says Mr. Rude. Chrysler is appealing the verdict.    The documents are &quot;extremely damaging when first shown,&quot; concedes Mr. Gluckman, the Chrysler lawyer. &quot;But if we get a fair hearing, we can neutralize them.&quot; The company says that it has won four of the seven cases where the documents were used.    He and other company officials say the documents aren't evidence of safety problems. For instance, Mr. Renneker, now an engineering director with Chrysler, says he never believed the Jeep CJ's were unsafe. His documents were just &quot;talking papers&quot; to stimulate discussion on new vehicle designs, he says, adding, &quot;Some of the things I wrote may not have been worded as well as they should have been.&quot;    And adding roll-bar reinforcements in the 1980 tests wasn't meant to signal a lack of faith in the Jeep's crashworthiness, Chrysler officials maintain. It was merely that the test driver was going to be exposed to some &quot;very dangerous situations,&quot; says Mr. Gluckman.    Nor, the company points out, did it try to hide documents criticizing the Jeeps. Chrysler officials say the existence of the 1973 roll-bar memo wasn't disclosed because they didn't know it existed until contacted by this newspaper. The officials dismiss the memo as merely the observations of one engineer.    ---         Rising Utility Vehicle Sales: How Big a Risk?
