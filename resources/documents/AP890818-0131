The kidnapping of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid at his south Lebanonhome by Israeli commandos July 28 caused retaliatory threats againstAmerican hostages in Lebanon.   Some members of Congress denounced the abduction. President Bushcalled for the release of all people held against their will and didnot exclude Obeid, who is affiliated with Hezbollah, the pro-Iranianextremist group believed to sponsor hostage-holders.   The captors of Lt. Col. Willian R. Higgins, a U.S. Marinekidnapped while on U.N. duty in south Lebanon, said they hanged himin retaliation three days after Obeid was seized, but there werereports he had been killed months ago.   Joseph Cicippio, one of the seven other American hostages, wasthreatened with death, then given a reprieve.   An Israeli source close to the government said Friday ``anunderstanding'' was reached between Foreign Minister Moshe Arens andSecretary of State James A. Baker III soon after the Obeid abductionthat they would adopt a joint policy for the hostage crisis.   He added, on condition of anonymity: ``There is an expressedIsraeli commitment, when the crisis is over, to discuss withAmericans coordination of future Israeli activities that may havebearing on American interests and citizens.''   That, he said, was ``the price Israeli has paid for not beingcriticized now by the United States.''   Dan Naveh, an adviser to Arens, confirmed that Arens and Bakerdiscussed future coordination in the days after the kidnapping.   ``They agreed not to get into this issue during the days of thecrisis, but in the future,'' Naveh said, and stressed that ``theconclusion was to discuss the issue, not necessarily reach anagreement.''   He did not describe the agreement for consultation as anexchange, but acknowledged that American criticism had abated.   Avi Pazner, an adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said:``In the first days after we captured Obeid, there was someunhappiness in Washington about it. ... Since then we havestraightened out these matters through constant dialogue, and thereis no problem today.''   The source close to the government said the Baker-Arens agreementcaused concern in military and intelligence circles.   ``Israel always prided itself on its autonomy in terms ofstrategy,'' the source said. ``There's a feeling that, in order toget off the hook for a few days, Arens has mortgaged Israel'sfreedom of maneuver.''   A U.S. congresswoman who met with Shamir on Friday said she wasencouraged by hopes of resolving the hostage situation, but she alsosaid she was anxious about American hostage Terry A. Anderson, thecaptive held longest.   Rep. Louise Slaughter, a Democrat who represents the New Yorkstate district where Anderson grew up, told reporters Shamir wouldnot give details on Israeli efforts to free the captives.   She said she felt ``frustration, as I am sure Terry does, thathis government hasn't done much.''   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Eight Westerners in addition tothe Americans are held in Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
