The closely held package delivery company said it added Greece, Portugal, Turkey and most Southeast Asian countries to the 22 foreign countries it already serves. It said it would use scheduled commercial air carriers for shipments to Asia.    UPS also said it acquired Asian Courier System, a Hong Kong-based package delivery company with more than 200 employees, and has integrated the company into UPS's delivery network. UPS declined to discuss price or terms.    The moves are likely to intensify competition between UPS and Federal Express Corp., Memphis, Tenn. Paul Schlesinger, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc., said UPS and Federal Express are each trying to &quot;seize the lead in offering door-to-door service in the international air cargo market. I think they'll both find significant revenues.&quot;    John Alden, a UPS senior vice president, declined to say when UPS would realize its goal of providing world-wide delivery service. But he said the company plans a major international expansion next year that will be &quot;as large&quot; as the current expansion. </TEXT></DOC>
