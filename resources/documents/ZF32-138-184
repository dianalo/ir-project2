But in his Marcharticle there are a few discussions in which the necessary notes are missing:andM;1.andP;  The ANSI operator for &quot;not equals' is  andless;andgt;.&quot;andP;  !=&quot; is something from C viaOracle.andM;2.andP;  ANSI does not prescribe &quot;GROUP BY andless;integerandgt;.&quot; Using integers after GRoupBY to represent column positions is an extension, apparently by analogy with&quot;ORDER BY andless;integerandgt;.&quot; An alternative but conflicting extension is to allow&quot;GROUP BY andless;expressionandgt;.&quot;andM;3.andP;  Dates such as  8-15-91&quot; are not ANSI standard.andP;  The current specificationis silent; the SQL/2 draft proposal calls for &quot;1991-08-15.&quot;andM;4.andP;  The suggestion that SQL has only two-valued logic does not apply to ANSI.andO;The 1989 document discussing comparison predicates, clearly states that ifeither side of a comparison iS NULL then result is uNKNowN, which is not thesame thing as FAME because its negation is itself-.andP;  UNKNOWN.andP;  This explainswhy Mr. Gerritsen gets the same result for c#=10 and its negation, c#andless;andgt;10,when C# is null.andP;  It's three-valued logic.andM;Peter GulutzanandM;President,andM;Ocelot Computer ServicesandM;Edmonton, AlbertaandM;Mr.andP;  Gerristsen replies.andP;  -  My goal in the series of articles was to helpPeoPle learn how to use SQL.andP;  References to the ANSI Standard wereincorporated to alert readers to cases where concepts and/or syntax might notbe universally applicable, and therefore perhaps not usable withimplementation of SQL they are using.andM;Mr.andP;  Gulutzan's first and third points, while correct, are insignificantwithin the context and goals of the tutorialandM;Regarding the second point, I don't know how I arrived at the falseassumption that GROUP BY andless;integerandgt; is Part of ANSI.andP;  As Mr. Gulutzan pointsout, it definitely is not.andP;  It's too bad this very useful extension is notpart of the ANSI SQL 2 specification.andM;I disagree with Mr. Gulutzan's fourth Point.andP;  Although the ANSI specificationrecognizes that search conditions can have three values, true, false orunknown, a three valued logic it is not.andP;  One can test only for true and, byusing NoT, for false.andP;  You can retrieve (or count, and so on) rows for whicha condition is true, and you can retrieve the rows for which the condition isfalse, but you cannot retrieve the rows for which the condition is unknown.andO;Appropriate syntax (for example, WHERE andless;expressionandgt; is UNKNOWN) has beenincluded in the proposed standard for SQL 2, however.andP;  - Rob Gerritsen</TEXT></DOC>
