Several prominent Filipinos boycotted the celebrations because ofdisappointment with Mrs. Aquino. Police opened fire to drive offabout 3,000 Marcos supporters demanding their leader's return fromHawaiian exile.   The military arrested three suspected right-wing extremists in avan filled with 30 cases of explosives outside the capital.   Mrs. Aquino, who returned Saturday from the funeral of Japan'sEmperor Hirohito, said President Bush and other internationalleaders ``told me that they admire us Filipinos for that non-violentrevolution.''   She made her comments following a Roman Catholic Mass alongEpifanio delos Santos Avenue, where hundreds of thousands ofcivilians turned out three years ago to protect soldiers whomutinied against Marcos.   Police estimated Saturday's crowd at 30,000, smaller than thelast two anniversaries.   ``I think it is up to the leaders of your country to initiate theways of peace,'' Mrs. Aquino told the crowd. ``I hope you will bepatient with us because we are in a transition period. I promisethat this day, we will unite and do a better job in serving you.''   Cardinal Jaime L. Sin said before Mrs. Aquino's speech thatcorruption and political bickering were diverting attention fromeradicating poverty and social injustice.   ``The old politics have come back to the dismay of us all _positioning for power, the corruption, the grandstanding, theinfluence-peddling, the petty bickering,'' he said.   Shooting erupted at a separate rally in Manila by about 3,000Marcos loyalists, who demanded Marcos be allowed to return fromHonolulu, where he has been exiled since his 20-year rule ended Feb.25, 1986.   Witnesses said three plainclothed policemen bolted from a vehicleand forced one Marcos supporter inside. When protesters rushed thecar, the policemen fired in the air and sped away, the witnessessaid.   Police spokesman Albert Gatos said he and two fellow officerswere transporting a robbery suspect when the loyalists attackedtheir car. Gatos said one loyalist was arrested.   Saturday's celebrations began with the ringing of church bellsacross this island nation and included fireworks, street dancing andunveiling of a giant statue of the Virgin Mary.   Among those boycotting the celebrations was Sen. Juan PonceEnrile, the former defense minister who led the military mutinyagainst Marcos but then turned against Mrs. Aquino as well.   ``They really wanted change for the country,'' said Enrile, whowas fired as defense minister in November 1986 after a coup attemptby his followers. ``Our future is still dim.''   But Defense Minister Fidel Ramos, another figure in theanti-Marcos revolt, said the government needs more time to achieveits goals.   On Saturday, the military said two soldiers and one civilian werearrested outside the capital in a van packed with 30 cases ofexplosives. A senior officer said the three were believed linked toright-wing extremists.   Lt. Col. Manuel Oxales said the three were arrested late Fridayin Taytay, a few miles from the celebration site.</TEXT></DOC>
