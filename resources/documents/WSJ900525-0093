He has announced plans to expose thegovernment's new economic program to a referendum, thoughit's hard for us to see precisely what might be learned fromthe exercise. He would be asking voters to pick between thedoleful status quo and what he's offering -- a watered-downreform called the &quot;regulated market economy.&quot; Will a voteagainst the reform mean people want a more radical program orless change?   Democracy is normally about real choices, and while theKremlin continues to toy with the idea, it's well alongelsewhere in the Soviet empire. Elections Sunday in SovietArmenia for its Supreme Soviet provided important gains forthe Pan-National Party, an anti-communist grouping on theballot for the first time. Turnout was low -- about 50% --and results were so unclear that the republic faces a runoff.But the anti-communists won the Armenian capital of Yerevanand the city of Kirovakan.</LP><TEXT>   Voters in Parakar, just outside Yerevan, sent aparticularly forceful message. They gave 91% of their vote toParuyr Hayrikyan, who backs secession from Moscow. Mr.Hayrikyan rolled to this margin of victory without shaking asingle voter's hand. The Soviet government dumped him inEthiopia back in 1988, and he conducted this campaign fromexile in Glendale, California.   That Soviet Armenia could produce such a result shows thecontinuing attraction of the democratic impulse. It must beremembered that Armenia today is a state in considerabledistress. It has recently endured the devastating 1988earthquake, a lengthy railroad blockade by Azerbaijan and aJanuary massacre of Armenians in Baku. Not surprisingly,these events have sent much of the republic into newlawlessness and despair. The neighboring republic of Georgia,which will have elections this fall, has similar instability,with anti-communist forces forming to produce democracy orsimply to destabilize the republic.   It would be wrong, though, to write off the Caucasus aslittle more than a budding Lebanon, as is often the tendencyin the West when dealing with this part of the world. Todismiss the region as a caldron of inter-ethnic animosity isto give the Kremlin a rationale for suppressing anydisturbances in the region, as it did last January inNagorno-Karabakh.   We're not advocating bloodshed in the Soviet Union, but itis important to recognize that there are now peoplestruggling to gain the advantages of democraticself-determination in places such as Armenia. If thedemocratic impulse is to take hold in an Armenia, Georgia orLithuania, it is going to be necessary for the West to noticetheir advances and support their legitimate needs.   Moscow took Mr. Hayrikyan's citizenship when it jettisonedhim from the country, barring his return to what is now hisown constituency. If Mr. Gorbachev wants to offer voterschoices about their politics or their economy, he could starttelling the exiled but newly elected Mr. Hayrikyan that hecan have his passport back.</TEXT></DOC>
