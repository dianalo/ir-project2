The Soviets are developing their defenses, he said, while Congress guts funding for our own. What the President didn't say, but should have, is that the U.S. could deploy a limited nuclear defense fairly quickly if the Washington political community could muster the will.    Mr. Reagan was most intriguing yesterday when he talked about the Soviet SDI program, which has become the elephant-in-the-room of American strategic policy. Many would just like to forget it's there. The President, however, reminded his audience that only last December General Secretary Gorbachev told NBC's Tom Brokaw that the Soviets are doing all that the U.S. is doing on SDI. &quot;Well, everything . . . and more,&quot; added Mr. Reagan. &quot;The Soviet defense effort, which some call 'Red Shield,' is now over 15 years old and they've spent over $200 billion on it.&quot; That's 15 times what the U.S. has spent on SDI, he said, while some 10,000 Soviet scientists and engineers are working on their military laser program alone.    Sophisticates who think the Soviet effort has been limited by the 1972 ABM treaty also got a surprise. &quot;We should be concerned,&quot; he said, &quot;that together with a longstanding program and the construction of the Krasnoyarsk radar as part of an updated early warning system, the Soviets may be preparing a nationwide ABM defense of their territory.&quot; Then Mr. Reagan added: &quot;In other words, they may be preparing to break out of the ABM treaty.&quot; Regular readers of this space know that the evidence for a judgment of a Soviet ABM breakout is the subject of a continuing dispute in the U.S. intelligence community.    As it happens, Mr. Reagan's speech comes only a few days after the Defense Department issued its own hedged statement concerning reports of a Soviet breakout. &quot;The totality of Soviet activities in the ABM field indicates a significant commitment to enhancing the strategic defenses of the U.S.S.R.,&quot; said the statement. Specifically, however, the statement said Defense does not believe the Soviets are mass-producing Flat Twin and Pawn Shop mobile radars, which are limited by the ABM treaty. And it said that while the Soviets are producing the relatively new SH-08 missile interceptors, Defense estimates that they have so far not produced more than the 100 they are permitted under the ABM treaty. The statement concludes that &quot;the Department does not believe the Soviets have decided to field a nationwide ABM defense at this time.&quot;    This is the kind of guidance that seems to say much more than it actually does. On the SH-08 interceptor, the actual number of missiles produced is subject to different estimates within the intelligence community, but the U.S. has evidence that the facility where the missiles are made has roughly doubled its capacity. In addition, the Soviets have other interceptors with ABM capability. The rest is mostly semantics. What is &quot;mass-producing&quot;? What is &quot;at this time&quot;? For that matter, what is a &quot;nationwide&quot; system? Others within the intelligence community have not accepted the Air Force intelligence estimate of an imminent Soviet ABM breakout, but even optimistic analyses have the Soviets doing enough things that would give them a near-term capability to do so.    While analysts on both sides are no doubt sincere, our own view is that U.S. strategic defense is too important to leave to intelligence ambiguities. Indeed, we have recently been treated to the argument that the U.S. shouldn't withdraw from the ABM treaty because if we do the Soviets will have too great a head start. In a recent hearing on the INF treaty, Sen. Sam Nunn reported that this is the very advice now being offered by the Joint Chiefs of Staff: &quot;They are saying that the termination of the ABM treaty at this juncture would inure to the benefit of the Soviet Union because they have a deployed system, they have experience, they have a head start. . . .&quot; In other words, the U.S. shouldn't withdraw from a treaty that is supposed to bind the Soviet Union, though it hasn't bound them for the past 15 years.    Rather than debating legalities, the U.S. could buy itself some highly useful insurance by starting to build the sort of system the ABM treaty already allows. Rep. Jim Courter (R., N.J.), former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and several others have urged just such a course in a recent letter to President Reagan. Similarly, Sen. Nunn has recently said the U.S. should explore just such an option. The treaty allows the U.S. to deploy 100 ABM interceptors, and the so-called ERIS missile technology is already available. By producing 100 at least the U.S. would have some protection against accidental or third-power launches, and also a production line in place to roll out the 101st interceptor, if some administration ever did decide to declare a Soviet breakout. It may not be a &quot;Red Shield,&quot; but at least it's better than none at all. </TEXT></DOC>
