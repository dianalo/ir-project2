A few months after the small Milwaukee brokerage collapsed underapparent mismanagement in March 1988, Mrs. Helding regained herentire stock portfolio and $45,000 in cash the firm owed her.   The message: If your broker goes bust your investment doesn'thave to.   With the recent collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., twoother brokerage bankruptcy court filings in the last year andwidely publicized problems at several Wall Street firms, the safetyof customer accounts is drawing attention.   An agency established by Congress after a rash of brokeragehouse failures in the late 1960s protects investors who may havethought their account went down the drain with the company thatmanaged it.   The Securities Investor Protection Corp. has a $485 million fundthat insures individual accounts for up to $500,000, including upto $100,000 in cash. Large brokerages also have insurance forlarger amounts.   Tapping into the protection fund is a last resort. If abrokerage firm goes belly up, SIPC first tries to arrange atransfer of customer accounts to another firm.   ``The basic intention is that a customer should not lose assetsor property because the broker with whom (he is) doing business hasencountered financial difficulty,'' said Theodore H. Focht, SIPC'spresident and general counsel.   SIPC _ pronounced sippick _ covers all forms of stock and bondholdings but not commodities. It also does not guarantee theunderlying value of a customer account. For example, if XYZ Co. istrading at $50 a share when a brokerage folds but falls to $5 atreimbursement time, the customer loses the difference.   ``It does not insure you for market losses,'' said IrvingPicard, a New York bankruptcy lawyer who has served as acourt-appointed SIPC trustee in three liquidation cases. ``If youthink the broker defrauded you ... that's not protected by the SIPCfund.''   In the 19 years since its creation, SIPC has handled 212 casesand paid $185 million to satisfy customer claims. If a firm can'timmediately pay, SIPC will advance the money to customers and tryto collect later.   SIPC officials estimate that cash and securities worth $1.4billion have been returned to about 240,000 investors, mostlythrough account transfers. A total of 305 claims worth $31 millionhave not been satisfied, primarily because of legal challenges.   The SIPC fund, comparable to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.for commercial banks, is fed by required contributions from thenation's 12,000 or so registered broker-dealers.   The Washington-based agency also has $500 million in bank creditand a $1 billion line to the U.S. Treasury. Neither resource hasbeen tapped. On top of that, about 25 firms have private coverageof up to $5 million per account.   Before SIPC was signed into law by President Nixon on Dec. 30,1970, self-regulatory organizations _ the National Association ofSecurities Dealers and the stock exchanges _ set aside funds toprotect customers of collapsed firms.   But in the late 1960s, Wall Street was hit with a rash offailures when the market slumped as firms spent large sums tocomputerize. When its customer protection kitty dried up, the NewYork Stock Exchange was forced to dip into a building fund tosafeguard investors. Fearing the worst, the exchanges lobbiedCongress for help.   There were six SIPC cases last year _ five involved a total ofunder 50 claims. The most cases in one year was 40 in 1972, duringa recession. A rash of financial fraud was partly responsible for46 cases from 1981-85.   SIPC's largest payout, $32.5 million, involved the 1983 criminalfraud-related collapse of Bell andamp; Beckwith of Toledo, Ohio. Thedemise of Fitzgerald, DeArman andamp; Roberts Inc. of Tulsa, Okla.,involved the most customer accounts, 50,000. SIPC has doled out$5.5 million since that case began in June 1988.   SIPC can get involved when a broker-dealer enters bankruptcycourt proceedings, when a trustee or receiver is appointed to run afirm, when a firm fails to meet federal requirements or when itcan't demonstrate compliance.   A brokerage can request a SIPC-run liquidation or SIPC can askthe Securities and Exchange Commission to seek a court order forone.   Drexel, for example, was not placed in a SIPC proceeding becauseonly its parent company filed for federal bankruptcy courtprotection and the firm is liquidating orderly. Plus, Drexel soldmost retail accounts to Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. last yearand the rest went to Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. after thebankruptcy filing.</TEXT><NOTE>End advance for PMs Thursday March 15</NOTE></DOC>
