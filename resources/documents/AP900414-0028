The Mediterranean fruit fly was found Thursday in a commercialorange grove in Woodcrest, sparking concerns that thecrop-destroying insect has established itself in the agriculturalregion, state officials said Friday.   The officials Friday also announced the discovery of two otherMedflies, one in an area of Glendora already sprayed by thepesticide malathion in a controversial program aimed at protectingcrops against the insect.   The other Medfly was found in suburban Walnut, in an area whichhas not been sprayed.   The discoveries prompted the state's science advisors to call ameeting for Monday to decide how to respond.   The Medflies were found less than a month after agriculturalofficials announced they would try to halt aerial malathionspraying in May and battle the pest with sterile flies.   The state Department of Agriculture has been spraying malathionover nearly 400 square miles of suburban Los Angeles and Orangecounties to battle an infestation that turned up last summer.   Medflies lay eggs in more than 200 fruits and vegetables.   The discovery of the Medfly in the Riverside County orange treewas particularly unsettling.   The region's navel oranges have already been picked and thearea's grapefruits and Valencia oranges won't be picked untilmid-summer. But officials worried about the economic impact of aserious infestation.   The quarantine is expected to let the fruit be sold within theUnited States, but some foreign countries, including Japan, may notaccept fruit grown in an infested area, officials said.   The exact boundaries of the quarantine were to be set Monday.   It was not immediately known whether officials would orderpesticide spraying in the area. A Medfly had been found in the samecommunity on March 21, but no spraying was ordered.   ``Since that is the second fly they've found out there,(pesticide) treatment is a possibility,'' said Medfly projectspokeswoman Natalie Bosecker.   Many residents have objected to having their homes sprayed atnight with malathion from helicopters out of fear the pesticide wasunhealthful and the helicopters could crash.   State officials have said the pesticide is sprayed in safe,small amounts and have defended the safety record of the companycontracted to fly the helicopters.</TEXT></DOC>
