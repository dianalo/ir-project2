The pact, calling for annual raises of 4 percent, was approvedby the union's members 97 percent to 3 percent, the guild and theAmerican Federation of Television and Radio Artists said in a jointstatement released Friday.   With 32,371 valid ballots returned by the April 28 votingdeadline, 31,365 members voted in favor of the contract and 1,006were opposed.   The new contract, which takes effect July 1, also includes whatofficials called a significant increase in producers' contributionsto the guild's health plan, a new minimum scale for ``top of theshow'' TV series guest stars, and increases in residuals for freeTV shows released to basic cable and foreign distribution.   The settlement came a month before contract negotiationsnormally begin, SAG and AFTRA officials said.
