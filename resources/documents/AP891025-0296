About 5,000 miners had voted for walkouts by Wednesday eveningand up to 20,000 at 12 mines were expected to strike, said ValentinKopasov, chairman of the Vorkuta area strike committee.   The strike violated a law passed this month by the Sovietlegislature setting arbitration procedures for would-be strikersand banning walkouts in such vital areas as energy, defense andtransportation.   First Deputy Premier Lev Voronin said this month that powerstations and public utilities had 4.5 million fewer tons of coal onhand than at the same time last year due to the summer strikes.   He said miners would have to work harder to avoid rationing ofheat, light and electricity this winter.   This summer, strikes in virtually all the Soviet Union's majorcoalfields, from Central Asia in the south to the Vorkuta fields inthe far north, paralyzed much of its coal industry. The miners, whodemanded better working conditions and consumer supplies as well asmore financial independence for their mines, went back to workafter the government conceded to almost all their demands.   But this week, miners in Vorkuta and in the western Siberianmining town of Mezhdurechensk declared the government had failed tocome through on some of the promised benefits.   About 20,000 Mezhdurechensk miners staged a two-hour warningstrike Monday despite officials' protests that they were showingdisrespect for the new law.   The Vorkuta strikers demanded the government fulfill itspromises of this summer and punish officials who had gone back ontheir word. They also wanted official status to be granted to newcommittees formed to defend workers' interests, Kopasov said.   As he spoke Wednesday by telephone from Vorkuta, word arrived atstrike headquarters that the town's chief prosecutor had orderedofficials at one of the striking mines to give him a list of thewalkout's organizers, Kopasov said.   He said that made the strike leaders expect a crackdown fromlocal authorities.   At a news conference Tuesday, the head of the Interior Ministrytroops that have been sent in to quell major unrest around theSoviet Union in recent months said his soldiers would not be calledon to repress any renewed strikes.   ``That is a political-legal question. We handle only massivedisorders,'' said Col.-Gen. Yuri Shatalin.   This summer's coal strikes involved virtually no violence.Strikers policed their own ranks and the authorities generallyrefrained from intervening.   But that was before the new law on strikes, when the strikers'legal status was unclear. The government has not indicated what itsresponse to such open defiance of the new law will be.   There has been no report of reprisals against the Mezhdurechenskworkers who struck Monday.   Kopasov said the Vorkuta strikers also were demandingpublication of an appeal to the country's workers that called forsolidarity and condemned the new strike law.   The law ``is aimed at depriving workers of the right to theextreme measure of striking, and at distancing the worker from theprocess of democratization,'' it said in part.   The strikers also put forth several political demands, includingthat the country's legislature consider doing away with the articlein the constitution that makes the Communist Party the ``leadingand guiding force of Soviet society,'' Kopasov added.</TEXT></DOC>
