In this paper wediscuss the usefulness of MRI especially in the assessment of vascularabnormality in this disease. At first, MRI and cerebral angiography insix cases of ''Moyamoya Disease'' were studied. The vascular diameterof cavernous portion in angiogram were compared with the degree of stenosisof that portion in MRI. There was good correlation between the degreeof stenosis in angiography and that in MRI. Also MRI clearly revealedthe stenosis or occlusion in the circle of Willis, and the developmentof ''Moyamoya'' vessel in basal ganglia. Next, we examined the usefulnessof fast scan, which is a new method obtaining the vascular enhanced image.In normal fast scan, images of each arteries of the circle of Willissuch as terminal portion of ICA or proximal portion of ACA, MCA are constantlydelineated in high intensity in contrast with brain parenchyma, skullbone, soft tissue, venous system, and CSF space which are visualizedin low intensity in general. In the cases of ''Moyamoya Disease'', eachportion of the circle of Willis as well as cavernous portion of ICA showedstenotic change which are more clearly demonstrated in fast scan. Andthe development of ''Moyamoya'' vessels in basal cistern was also visualizedin detail with good contrast. On the other hand, ''Moyamoya'' vesselsin basal ganglia are not always visualized clearly. As a result, vascularabnormality of ''Moyamoya Disease'' is evaluated finely and noninvasivelyin detail in MRI, and MRI is useful in screening and follow-up in thisdisease.</TEXT></DOC>
