O'Connor said he did not come to Lebanon to negotiate on behalfof the United States but he would gladly meet with the hostages,even if that meant entering the Moslem sector of Beirut.   ``I hope that they can hear my voice or can see me or can readthat the people of our country have not forgotten them. They're inour prayers,'' he said.   Among the missing foreigners is Anglican church envoy TerryWaite, who came on a mission to try to gain the release ofhostages. He disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1988, after leavinghis hotel for a meeting with captors of some of the victims.   Before O'Connor arrived, Syrian gunners shelled the Christiancoastline north of Beirut, despite an appeal by Arab leaders toobserve a cease-fire.   More than 350 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 woundedsince March 8 when the latest round of fighting broke in Lebanon's14-year-old civil war.   O'Connor said the fighting in Lebanon, in which the Christianforces are heavily outnumbered and outgunned by the Syrians andtheir allies, has been largely ignored by the U.S. and world media.   ``This is extraordinary, that a nation is being destroyed, areligious body is being almost obliterated and an organism where somany religions lived harmoniously is being torn apart and we reallyhaven't responded,'' he said.   O'Connor, who came in his role as President of the RomanCatholic Near West Welfare Association, flew in from Larnaca,Cyprus, aboard a military helicopter provided by Christian leaderGen. Michel Aoun.   The helicopter landed after sunset at the hilltop monastery ofBkirki, seat of Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, ninemiles north of Beirut.   Sfeir, spiritual head of the Maronite sect that has dominatedthe government since Lebanon gained independence from France in1943, will be O'Connor's host during his three-day visit.   O'Connor, who ignored State Department objections to the trip,stopped in Rome on Friday for talks with Pope John Paul II. He cameto Bkirki with a Vatican passport and visa to sidestep a U.S. banon travel to Lebanon.   He told reporters in Larnaca the pope is distressed about theLebanese crisis. ``I haven't seen him nearly so anguished aboutanything else as he is about Lebanon,'' O'Connor said. ``It's justeating away at him.''   Asked whether he was afraid to be in Lebanon, O'Connor smiledand said: ``No I'm not. Why should I be?''   There are 15 foreigners, including nine Americans, held hostagein Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Asked if he would seek to free the hostages, O'Connor, whovisited Lebanon in June 1986, said: ``I'll certainly say what Isaid last time I was here about the American hostages and allhostages. I'm not an ambassador from the United States. I'm simplya priest, a churchman.''   He said, ``I'm not here as a negotiator ... If their captorswould permit me to see them, then I'd be very happy to see them anddo anything I could to help them.'' Asked whether he would crossBeirut's dividing Green Line to the Moslem sector, where most ofthe hostages are believed held, the cardinal said: ``I'll be goingto wherever Patriarch Sfeir thinks I should go.''   Officials said O'Connor was scheduled to drive to west Beirut tomeet with acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads a MoslemCabinet vying for legitimacy with a Christian government headed byAoun.   The cardinal was scheduled to meet Sunday with Aoun at theshell-battered presidential palace in Baabda, five miles east ofBeirut.</TEXT></DOC>
