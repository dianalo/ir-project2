Each year, thousands of would-be business owners toss off the corporate security blanket and plunge into new ventures.    But many will fail without a realistic assessment of their financial needs and the ability of the business to support those needs. &quot;Optimism isn't going to pay the bills,&quot; says Karen Spero, president of Spero Financial Services Inc., a Cleveland-based financial planning concern.    Rarely do new businesses support their owners from the start. &quot;This is something people often fail to consider,&quot; Stanley Greene, a financial planner in the New York office of accountants Laventhol andamp; Horwath, says. &quot;They think they will have income immediately.&quot;    The first step -- one that must come before an executive leaves the safety of the corporation -- is a business plan. It can show a prospective owner when the new venture might be able to support him. Among other things, making the plan forces the owner to provide a month-by-month projection of cash needs and receipts for the first three to five years.    People who don't know how to compile a business plan can take a course at some local colleges or from a trade association. Or they can pay -- perhaps $1,000 to $2,500 -- to have one done for them. &quot;You have to have a business plan,&quot; Ms. Spero says, adding that without one, owners are only making wishful guesses.    A woman who started her own art company without a business plan learned belatedly how important one can be. She came to Ms. Spero a few months ago for help, explaining that she expected the company to support her within a year. She felt secure when she opened the business a year ago because she had money set aside to cover personal expenses, $3,500 a month, for more than a year.    But her funds will be exhausted in January or February, and the business probably can't start supporting her until a year from now. &quot;She is going to run out of money unless she sells her home,&quot; Ms. Spero says.    This woman isn't willing to sacrifice her home and may end up looking for a job.    But some people with the entrepreneurial itch are too quick to liquidate assets to fuel a venture. They may grab money earmarked for their children's education or cash in vested retirement benefits, believing they can replace the funds when their new company takes off.    Financial planners advise against this. &quot;Money put into a new business ought to be money you can afford to lose,&quot; says Earl Wright, president of Asset Management Group, a financial advice concern in Denver.    Age and family obligations should influence the decision of whether to liquidate fixed assets and retirement accounts. A 37-year-old executive, for example, can risk more than someone 10 or 15 years older.    &quot;If the younger person fails after five years, he will be 42 and able to go to work for someone and spend another 20 years at a company and be okay,&quot; Mr. Wright says. An older executive is taking a much bigger gamble, as the majority of new ventures do fail.    Executives also may find that duplicating the insurance coverage provided by employers is impossible or prohibitively expensive. &quot;Sometimes the cost of insurance can be a big reason for not leaving,&quot; Mr. Greene of Laventhol andamp; Horwath says.    But once an employee has decided to make the move, quitting a job can be timed to maximize benefits. &quot;Some people have waited for a Christmas bonus and used it for start-up money,&quot; Edward Mendlowitz, a New York certified public accountant, says. A departure date also may be delayed to earn another year of retirement benefits, he says.    Moreover, a would-be owner needing to borrow for the business should arrange a loan while still employed, Mr. Mendlowitz says. An executive with good credit often can borrow as much as 20% of gross annual salary on an unsecured basis, he says. &quot;By virtue of being employed, you are creditworthy,&quot; he says. &quot;But if you aren't employed, you may not be able to borrow anything.&quot;    ---   Mr. Jacobs is a senior special writer in The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.
