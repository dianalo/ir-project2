MRimaging using Gd-DTPA was more sensitive than enhanced CT and very usefulfor detecting a new focus of cerebral infarction, especially in the caseswith multiple infarcted areas and for showing the extent of corticaland subcortical infarction. In most cases the MR enhancement was obviousin the subacute stage, especially after cerebral embolism, and the signalintensity of the lesion tended to show a gradual increase. The diagnosisof embolism was accepted on the basis of acute onset without prior TIA,coupled with angiography showing the embolus itself and/or a capillaryblush and a wide area of infarction.</TEXT></DOC>
