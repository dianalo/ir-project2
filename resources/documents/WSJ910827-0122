He is amosquito-control man, and he is doing a &quot;landing-rate count.&quot;   The mosquitoes attack. &quot;Fifteen or 20 of them around myhead,&quot; Mr. Cranston calls out. He looks down at his body,dotted with new arrivals. &quot;We got a good 20-to-30 countmoving right now.&quot; Then: Swat. He slaps his forehead. Swat.Slaps his neck. Swat. Slaps his cheek. &quot;That's a BIG one]&quot;The mosquitoes continue to sally. He slaps his arms, slapshis legs. Mosquitoes everywhere. Swat. Swat. Swat-swat-swat.&quot;Look at my pants NOW]&quot;</LP><TEXT>   After about a minute, Mr. Cranston brushes himself withhis hands, shakes his head and hurries back to his truck. &quot;Iwould call this a nuisance,&quot; he says, firmly.   He also calls it a &quot;30-count,&quot; meaning that an estimated30 mosquitoes landed on him during his minute or so outdoors.That's a heavy enough infestation for the Dade CountyMosquito Control Division, for which Mr. Cranston works as aninspector, to dispatch a spray unit to try to kill themosquitoes before they blow into more-populated areas. Mr.Cranston logs his findings, then drives to another site andoffers himself up for yet another landing-rate count.   This type of work is known as &quot;mosquito surveillance,&quot; and18 of mosquito control's 27 staffers do it fulltime. Likemost intelligence work, it isn't particularly glamorous; butlike all good intelligence work, it allows people to sleep alittle easier, particularly those who sleep with the windowsopen.   But to do it for a living?   &quot;Let's put it this way: We earn our money,&quot; says Mr.Cranston, a big blond man with a mustache and goatee, whorather resembles Hulk Hogan after a dozen or so Big Macs. &quot;Idon't like getting bit by mosquitoes any more than the nextguy. But somebody's got to do it. And it's not bad work.&quot;   He adds, &quot;It's the only job I ever had where they give youa four-wheel-drive truck with an FM radio in it and tell youto go out in the swamp. I do that on my vacation. Except onmy vacation, I take my rifle. But you can't shoot mosquitoeswith a rifle anyway.&quot;   During the summer here, you might try. South Florida is amosquito mecca, and the hajj is on. &quot;We get rains in May, andmillions and millions and millions of eggs hatch out in theEverglades, and seven to 10 days later you get millions andmillions and millions of mosquitoes flying around,&quot; saysMarlon Nelms, chief of the mosquito-control unit, whoseterritory stretches from north of Miami to the Everglades onthe west and south to mainland's end.   &quot;We kill them, but the wind keeps blowing new ones in.It's kind of like a big merry-go-round.&quot;   This year has been especially bad. In the first week ofJune, during the season's inaugural invasion, Mr. Nelms'soffice logged more than 1,000 calls a day from citizensreporting mosquito problems -- compared with 12,578 calls inall of 1990. On June 4, the office got a record 1,871 calls,filling 53 pages of the official Mosquito Annoyance ComplaintLog.   Things are abating, and calls are down to 40 or 50 a day,which is normal for this time of year. However, major attackscan continue throughout the rainy season, which usually laststhrough October.   Florida, of course, is not alone. &quot;The unique thing aboutthese creatures is there's no part of the U.S. that isn'tthreatened by them at one time or another, from the desertsto the high mountains to the marsh,&quot; says Jimmy K. Olson,professor of entomology at Texas Aandamp;M University. &quot;They're anextremely adapted group.&quot;   Certainly, they've adapted to Texas. For mosquitodiversity, it is the No. 1 state, with 82 or 83 species,compared with Florida's 71. But diversity isn't everything.For mass and sheer meanness, there's nothing quite likeAlaska's summer mosquitoes. &quot;They even attack the caribou,&quot;says John Manly, the governor's deputy press secretary.   (A word here about biting and sex: Only female mosquitoesbite; they need the protein in blood to produce eggs. Theitch comes from saliva they inject. As for males, they&quot;really don't serve any purpose except to fertilize thefemales, which they do in the first day or so {of life}, andafter that they die,&quot; says Mr. Nelms. Females live on forthree weeks or so.)   Alaska's mosquito season is short-lived, becausemosquitoes don't like cold weather. South Florida, however,doesn't have such an out. &quot;I have actually been in theEverglades in January when the numbers were quite high,&quot; saysGeorge O'Meara, a University of Florida entomologist. &quot;If youhave mild winters and rainfall at the appropriate time, theeggs will hatch.&quot;   Although mosquitoes are mainly a nuisance, they can be apublic-health problem, for certain species can carryencephalitis, malaria and other potentially fatal diseases.Last year, nine people died in Florida, including two in DadeCounty, of St. Louis encephalitis. In recent weeks, a fewcases of another type of encephalitis, Eastern equineencephalitis, have been reported in northern Florida; twopeople have died in the outbreak.   Mosquito control is such a priority in Florida that somecounties have special taxing districts to finance theirefforts. Here in Dade, though, mosquito control comes underthe county, and this year the division has a $1.3 millionbudget. The mosquito division's arsenal includes 12 spraytrucks, two helicopters and one airplane.   &quot;The mosquito population is something that is verydifficult to gauge and almost impossible to predict what it'sgoing to do,&quot; says Mr. Nelms, Dade's top mosquito man. &quot;Theonly thing we do, in reality, is react to it. We don't knowthey're here until they're here. We may be at a reasonablylow level of mosquitoes one day, and the following day therecan be just millions and millions and millions.&quot;   Thus, surveillance. The idea is to keep tabs on the enemyby weekly samplings of mosquito populations at hundreds oflocations around the county, as well as checking other sitesthat people phone in to report. Tools of the trade includemosquito traps -- their overnight yields are counted andanalyzed every day -- and visual inspections of possiblebreeding sites, from back yards to swamps.   However, the most colorful, and onhands, method is thelanding-rate count, which inspectors often do dozens of timesa day, especially during the high season.   Different inspectors have different techniques. Mr. Nelmssays he tries to stand still for half a minute or so, countthe number on one arm and one leg, then multiply by two. &quot;Iam probably bitten several hundred times a year,&quot; he says.&quot;It probably itches for three or four minutes, and then itstops.&quot; Ana Patrick, another inspector, often dons whitecoveralls, the better to see the enemy and keep it off herskin. Inspector Joe Humkey sorts his sites, like partyguests, into A, B and C lists; the A list -- with the mostpredictably lively mosquitoes -- gets visited at least twicea week. In heavily infested areas, inspectors often wearbeekeeper hats, with netting, to keep the fauna off theirfaces.   Anything over a 20-count is considered worthy of goingafter. Armageddon is a 200-count. &quot;Oh man,&quot; says Mr.Cranston, recalling one such experience. &quot;Let's put it thisway: I couldn't breathe.&quot;   Even with low-level incursions, inspectors don't get hungup in details. &quot;Basically, it is an estimation,&quot; Mr. Cranstonexplains, as he leaves this sampling spot. &quot;I can only countwhat I see, and obviously I can't see my back, so there couldbe more. You aren't going to say you've got a 27-count,because who is going to sit and count 27 mosquitoes? You saya 30 count or a 20 count. You estimate.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
