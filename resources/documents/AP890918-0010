(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Holly Hunter, winner of an Emmy as bestactress in a drama special for ``Rowe vs. Wade,'' spoke outbackstage for abortion rights, but the movie's writer called it astory that takes no sides.   ``I think this is an award for the drama, not the politics,''said Alison Cross, co-producer and writer ``Roe vs. Wade,'' whichshared the Emmy for outstanding drama special.   ``I don't think the Academy gave us this award as a pro-choicestatement,'' she said.   Cross, forced by NBC to rewrite the script 20 times _ ostensiblyto remove any editorial viewpoint _ said, ``We tried very hard tomake this as good a show as possible and not make compromisesnecessary for television.''   The show told the story of Norma McCorvey, the real life ``JaneRoe'' whose U.S. Supreme Court case established a woman's legalright to abortion.   In her acceptance speech, Hunter, who portrayed the McCorveycharacter, thanked her for ``continuing to fight and keep women frombeing second-class citizens and for refusing to give up her rightfor reproductive choice.''   Backstage, she reiterated her views and said, in an answer to aquestion, that ``Roe vs. Wade'' did not take a middle-of-the-roadstance.   ``It couldn't be right down the middle,'' she said. ``The storywas following a woman fighting for a pro-choice right.''   ``Roe vs. Wade'' was not the only winner inspired by newsheadlines.   Writer Abby Mann, who won for his, ``Murderers Among Us: TheSimon Wiesenthal Story,'' criticized the TV industry for notaddressing serious subjects more frequently.   ``The industry as a whole is terribly cowardly and ignoranttoward those subjects,'' he said, ``and I'm ashamed of it.''   He said his next project is a book on the McMartin preschoolmolestation trial, which he hopes will become a movie.   Actor Larry Drake, who won for his role of a mentally retardedman on ``L.A. Law,'' said his award meant more because his characteris ``well received'' by the mentally retarded community.   Producer and writer David Rintels, whose ``Day One,'' the storyof the making of the first U.S. atomic bomb, tied with ``Roe vs.Wade'' for outstanding drama special, said it was a hard fightgetting the show on the air   ``It took 4{ half years,'' he said. ``It took some courageoussupport from the network (CBS). It was thrilling that we had theresources and support to do it the way we wanted.''   Even the comedy winners seemed in a serious mood this year. Theyspoke of their surprise at winning and how worthy their opponentswere.   Rhea Perlman, who won as best supporting actress for the fourthtime for her role in, ``Cheers,'' wasn't cheering. ``I don't thinkanybody deserves it this many times,'' she said.   Diane English, who won for writing ``Murphy Brown,'' wonderedaloud about how her Emmy would boost the show's sale price in thetelevision syndication market.   And Richard Mulligan, who won for his lead role in ``EmptyNest,'' wasn't in a joking mood either. ``I don't know that I'm afunny person,'' he said. ``Billy Crystal is funny. Robin Williams isfunny. I'm just an actor who can get it on.''</TEXT></DOC>
