But just howseverely isn't so predictable.   World oil prices surged yesterday after Iraqi PresidentSaddam Hussein sent troops rolling across his nation's100-mile border with Kuwait and swiftly conquered the tinysheikdom. The startling move threatens to put oil prices on anew, higher plane that could continue for years.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Oil in the teens is, for the foreseeable future,nostalgia,&quot; predicts Shahrokh Nikkhah, a senior vicepresident at Prudential-Bache Securities. He sees U.S. crudeoil prices settling into a range of $26 to $27.50 a barrel.Only weeks ago, U.S. oil was selling as low as $16 a barrel,and some less-desirable Mideast crudes were $4 a barrelcheaper than that.   How far oil prices might rise in the near term is aguessing game. Much depends on the next moves not only byIraq and its Persian Gulf neighbors but also by theindustrialized nations that consume most of the world'spetroleum. And most of all, it may depend on the U.S., whichimmediately barred Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude -- now in Iraq'shands -- from American shores.   Erratic as they are, oil prices could of course fall asfast as they now are climbing. Industry fundamentals reallyhaven't changed yet; there still is a world oil glut, and theprice increases are largely due to a change in marketpsychology.   World oil markets were thrown into turmoil yesterday,however, with prices surging between $1.50 and $3.50 a barrelfor the day. In the U.S., spot prices of West TexasIntermediate, the benchmark crude, topped $23 a barrelyesterday. Another key oil, North Sea Brent, rose from $20.20a barrel to $22.70.   For Big Oil such news was cause for rejoicing. Thoughcompanies will pay more for any oil they buy, most also drillfor, produce and sell crude themselves. What they get forthat oil will be up just as sharply. Also, refining profitscan improve despite higher raw material costs if end productslike gasoline go up enough.   But government officials in Washington estimate that therise in oil prices that has already occurred, if it sticks,could add a full percentage point to consumer prices over thenext year. It also could cut a half percentage point off thenation's growth -- a serious blow to an economy growing at anannual rate of just over one percentage point.   The hit could be felt most acutely by gasoline buyers, whomight have to pay an extra 10 cents or so a gallon, and laterthis year by families who heat their homes with oil.Consistently higher oil prices also would be a heavy blow toairlines and the chemical industry. They would make life moredifficult for auto makers, both domestic and foreign.   With control of Kuwaiti reserves, Iraq now has the powerto drive up oil prices, according to Philip Verleger, seniorfellow at the Institute for International Economics. &quot;Theycan easily make a $25-a-barrel price happen,&quot; he believes.&quot;They could even make $30 a barrel.&quot;   For some time, however, the impact of any Iraqi moves willbe softened somewhat by current unusually high levels of oilstocks. Mr. Verleger says stocks total about 1.65 billionbarrels, compared with the normal 1.5 billion. Moreover, theU.S. strategic petroleum reserve, squirreled away inunderground salt domes in Texas and Louisiana, now is bigenough to carry the country through any temporary supplydisruptions.   However, some 60% to 70% of the oil imported into the U.S.is priced on the basis of spot-market quotes, and a surge inspot prices would be felt quickly.   There's no denying American vulnerability. With domesticoil production slipping gradually but inexorably, about halfof U.S. oil supplies are now imported. In the first fivemonths of this year, Iraq and Kuwait combined were thefifth-largest suppliers to the U.S., after Saudi Arabia,Venezuela, Nigeria and Canada, according to the AmericanPetroleum Institute. Iraq provided about 610,000 barrels aday, and Kuwait about 121,000. Together, that was about 9% ofU.S. oil imports. OPEC as a whole provided about 54%.   How tough things get for U.S. oil users will dependlargely on how hard a line the U.S. takes against Iraq andIraq-controlled Kuwait. Many oil traders spent much ofyesterday trying to figure out how new U.S. import curbs willbe implemented. &quot;We're walking around here saying, `staycalm, stay calm, stay calm,'&quot; says Gerard Vetromile, vicepresident of crude trading for Chevron Corp.   President Bush's order is already causing temporarydislocations. Mr. Vetromile says Chevron took title to someIraqi crude two weeks ago, but the oil hasn't yet arrived atthe company's giant Pascagoula, Miss., refinery. &quot;If the U.S.government says we can't take that crude, it could create arefining problem for us by next week,&quot; Mr. Vetromile says.   American Petrofina is already stuck. It has four millionbarrels of Iraqi crude at sea heading toward its refinery inPort Arthur, Texas. One tanker carrying 500,000 barrels isdue today. &quot;We've been told by the customs people that wecannot unload that crude,&quot; says Ron Haddock, chief executive.He says the company has only a three-week supply of crude onhand and is being forced to hunt for other supplies.   Sen. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat, predicts thatmembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesmay be intimidated by Iraq into sticking to their productionquotas. &quot;The implications for this country are stark,&quot; hesays. &quot;OPEC discipline has now been insured by the point of agun.&quot;   At a joint news conference in Colorado yesterdayafternoon, President Bush and British Prime Minister MargaretThatcher didn't address directly the question of whether theindustrial nations would engage in a full-scale embargo ofoil from Iraq and Kuwait.   Any such oil embargo would be far different from that in1973. Then, it was producers who struck against consumers. A1990 embargo, should it occur, would be a consumers' boycott.That this could even be contemplated probably is a tribute tothe stored supplies of the Western nations, as well as Iraq'sisolation from the rest of the world, including Arabneighbors.   However, the upshot in the marketplace of such aneventuality could match that of the past -- surging oilprices. And whether the U.S., Europe and Japan could dealmore effectively with such a surge remains to be seen.   If America's embargo isn't widely observed, it would meanlittle. Oil is a fungible commodity, and its ownership caneasily be disguised. And as of last night, there wasn't anyindication that the U.S. would press other nations hard to goalong.   But even oil prices modestly above current levels could dosome damage. &quot;Our economy would change from a growing to adeclining economy by the fourth quarter,&quot; says DonaldRatajczak, economic forecaster at Georgia State University.   Michael Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council ofEconomic Advisers, attempted to play down the effects intestimony yesterday morning on Capitol Hill. A 25% rise inoil prices would have &quot;some deleterious impact on oureconomy,&quot; he acknowledged, but he argued that &quot;our economytoday is much better able to absorb modest price increases.&quot;He noted in an interview later that companies now have moreflexibility to switch to natural gas and other forms ofenergy.   Meanwhile, Rep. Toby Roth, a Wisconsin Republican, urgedfellow lawmakers &quot;to focus an eagle eye&quot; on what oilcompanies do about pricing.   Whatever the oil companies plan to do, people ranging fromeconomists to truckers are scrambling to figure out how tocope with suddenly unpredictable oil prices. And someservice-station operators are already talking aboutgasoline-price gouging -- by their competitors.   &quot;There's going to be some gouging out there, you can besure,&quot; says Sasan Faraji, manager of Fenway Park Exxon inBoston. He says he won't raise his prices unless his owncosts go up. But a nearby competitor, whom he won't name, hasjust added another 5/10ths of a cent to his prices, healleges. &quot;All this just hit us this morning,&quot; he says.&quot;People are still trying to figure out where Kuwait is -- orwas.&quot;   Gasoline prices in California have just gone up five centsa gallon, though apparently the rise is due to a gas-taxincrease aimed at expanding mass transit and improving roadmaintenance. Stephen R. Shelton, executive director of theSouthern California Service Station Association, expectsretail gasoline prices to increase, but not for at least 30days because of current ample inventory.   Eventually, though, motorists may take a heavy hit.Generally, each $1 increase in a barrel of crude couldtranslate into about 2.5 cents a gallon at the pump. Thus, asustained $4-a-barrel increase would drive gasoline up almost10 cents a gallon. Already, American Petrofina says it israising gasoline prices by a nickel a gallon. Among thosefeeling the effects of this would be the auto industry.   The Iraqi action catches foreign and domestic auto makersin the middle of a move toward more powerful, less fuelefficient cars spurred by a relative decline in gasolineprices during the late 1980s. New-car fuel efficiency hasfallen two years in a row, after rising steadily since 1978.Japanese auto makers contributed heavily to this decline,introducing new models with powerful V-6 and V-8 engines.Now, auto makers face the risk of a consumer shift in buyingpatterns.   A 10-to-20-cent-a-gallon rise in gasoline prices might nothave much impact, &quot;but 50 {cents} would,&quot; says Bennett E.Bidwell, chairman of Chrysler's automotive operations. Adds aToyota spokesman: &quot;We figure that to have any effect onsales, it would have to be at least a quarter.&quot;   If consumers do react to this latest oil problem byreturning to smaller, more efficient cars, Japanese automakers seem best-positioned -- much as they were more than adecade ago. The average fuel economy of cars sold by ToyotaMotor Corp. in the U.S. is 31.8 miles to the gallon, downfrom Toyota's 33-mile-a-gallon average a year ago but stillbetter than the domestic average of 26.9 miles to the gallon.Nissan's average is 30.8 miles a gallon.   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., despite majoradvances in fuel economy, still rely heavily on full-size,V-6 and V-8 cars for their U.S. profits. Chrysler Corp.'shighest-profit vehicles, minivans and Jeep Cherokees, averageless than 20 miles a gallon in city driving.   As voracious consumers of fuel, airlines will feel thehigher prices rapidly. The airline industry estimates thatevery penny rise in the price-per-gallon of jet fuel adds$150 million to annual costs.   &quot;We're on our third bottle&quot; of antacid, says Jack Zaves,who manages the fuel needs of American Airlines, which usessome 2.4 billion gallons of jet fuel a year. &quot;How do youplan?&quot;   UAL Corp., the parent of United Air Lines, has said thatevery penny change in the price-per-gallon of jet fuel causesan approximately $22.5 million change in United's annual fuelbill. The huge carrier is accustomed to major changes. Itsaverage cost-per-gallon last year was 64 cents, up from 56cents in 1988 but far below the 83 cents in 1985. Most ofUnited's fuel is provided under contracts with major U.S. oilrefiners, but it also purchases minor volumes of fuel on thespot market at Gulf Coast and New York Harbor locations andoffshore from the Mideast.   &quot;Fuel surcharges are imminent,&quot; promises Dean Cannon,president of Cannon Express Corp., a Springdale, Ark.,trucking company. Fuel accounts for about 22% of hisoperating costs, and Mr. Cannon says that by noon yesterdayit is was already going up. He says he plans to send a lettertoday to warn about 500 of his customers of higher rates.   The threat of possibly sharply higher oil prices isalready being felt all around the industrial world. Theinflationary potential is a big problem for countries such asBritain, Italy and Spain, which are already struggling towring out stubbornly high inflation. For countries fightingto stave off a recession -- Britain as well as the U.S., forexample -- that problem has suddenly become worse, too. Evenunder the threat that slowdowns will turn into recessions,central bankers will find it more difficult to reduceinterest rates while climbing oil prices are pushing upinflation.   On the other hand, an excessive climb in oil prices woulddepress world-wide consumption. &quot;Forces like recessions comeinto play,&quot; says Tom Burns, a Chevron economist. &quot;So demandgoes down a bit. This has been of extreme concern to someOPEC producers.&quot;   Moreover, higher prices would encourage the U.S. and othernon-OPEC countries to expand oil development that isn'tprofitable when prices are lower. &quot;Longer-term, oil that istoday marginal or not economic suddenly becomes considerablymore attractive,&quot; Mr. Burns says. He cites the expansion ofenhanced-recovery projects in existing U.S. fields. Inaddition, West African and Latin American countries couldraise their oil output if prices climb. The Soviet Union andMexico still have a lot of untapped oil.   Previous price surges, in 1973 and 1979, ended forprecisely such reasons. Consumption declined for severalyears, partly because of widespread conservation. Andsupplies expanded as oil companies stepped up development ofnew areas such as Alaska's North Slope and the North Sea.Beginning in 1980, OPEC, for the first time in its history,lost market share.   The economic jolts from higher oil prices could bewidespread, however:   -- For West Germany and Japan, the expected rise in oilprices may well be the last straw that pushes central bankersto increase interest rates. Tokyo stocks entered a tailspin,amid expectations of higher inflation and a move by the Bankof Japan to raise the discount rate it charges on loans tofinancial institutions.   -- For Spain and Italy, higher oil prices are damaging.&quot;Italy is very reliant on external supplies of energy,&quot; saysEugenio Namor, an economist at San Paolo Bank in Turin. Hepredicts that recent reductions in inflation will bereversed.   -- For struggling East European states, Iraq's invasionmay make it all the more painful to wean themselves fromsubsidized oil purchases from the Soviet Union. Not only willthey have to pay hard currency for oil and gas but alsohigher prices than expected just last week.   -- For Sub-Saharan Africa, a higher cost of oil importscould cut deeply into hoped-for economic growth. Withinterest rates stuck at lofty levels or rising, the cost ofcapital also will be a constraint.   The specter of higher energy prices especially worriesJapan. Surging oil prices in the 1970s triggered severeinflation and forced companies to restructure theirmanufacturing operations drastically.   This time, Norbert Walter, chief economist at DeutscheBank AG, predicts another response from Japan: &quot;an exportoffensive in Europe.&quot; He reasons that with thealready-sluggish U.S. economy hit by higher energy costs,Europe will be the one major market to which Japan can turn.Japan's financial institutions, however, may well concentratetheir investments at home, at least for several months.   In any event, one clear winner is Mexico. Each $1-a-barrelincrease in oil prices raises its revenues about $500 milliona year, bolstering its balance of payments at a time when itis under pressure.   Mexico will face its own frustrations, though. PetroleosMexicanos S.A., the state oil monopoly and the world'sfifth-largest oil company, has limited room to increaseproduction and take advantage of higher prices. SinceMexico's debt crisis exploded in 1982, public investment inthe oil company, known as Pemex, has plunged about 75%.   &quot;I don't think there's anything significant they could doin the next three months or so to raise production,&quot; saysGeorge Baker, a Berkeley, Calif., oil consultant who followsthe company. &quot;Fundamentally, they're at a full-productionschedule now and have been for a year.&quot;   ---             The World's Precarious Oil Balance                                                                                                                             Where the Oil Is                                                                                                          Proved reserves at year-end 1989, in billions of barrels                                                                                                        Saudi Arabia                     255.0 Other Mideast                    117.9 Iraq                             100.0 Kuwait                            94.5 Iran                              92.9 U.S.S.R.                          59.9 U.S.                              42.4                                                                                                          Source: Oil andamp; Gas Journal in BP Statistical Review ofWorld Energy, 1990   ---                         Major Producers                                                                                                          Average 1989 output in millions of barrels a day; excludesnatural gas liquids                                                                                                        U.S.S.R.                         11.6 U.S.                              7.6 Saudi Arabia                      4.9 Iran                              2.9 Iraq                              2.8 Kuwait                            1.6                                                                                                          Source: Central Intelligence Agency</TEXT></DOC>
