The survey, released by the Bank of Japan on Friday,offers new evidence that inflation has peaked, and indicatesJapan's businesses remain committed to ambitious capitalspending goals, economists said.</LP><TEXT>   The survey, known as the tankan, showed corporateliquidity fell again in August and business confidencecontinued to fall. But Bank of Japan officials said thereport's indicators remain at historically high levels, andmany private economists concurred with their assessment.   &quot;Japan's economy continues to decelerate, but there are nosigns of any recessionary tendencies,&quot; said Russell Jones, aneconomist at UBS-Phillips andamp; Drew International Ltd.   &quot;It's a policymaker's dream,&quot; agreed Jesper Koll, chiefeconomist at S.G. Warburg Securities Ltd. &quot;This should beenough to dispel any fears that this economy is headed for acrash landing.&quot;   Some in the market had anticipated the tankan's releasemight spur the Bank of Japan to cut the official discountrate. The central bank lowered the discount rate half apercentage point to 5.5% on July 1, shortly after results ofthe last tankan were announced.   On Friday, the central bank raised expectations it mightcut the discount rate again by allowing Japan's key overnightrate, the cost of unsecured cash that banks deal amongthemselves, to fall below 7%. Cuts by Japan's commercialbanks in their short-term prime rates, the charge on loans ofone year and less, began Friday with Sanwa Bank cutting itsrate a quarter point to 7.375%.   But economists said they found little in the report tosuggest central bank officials would lower the discount ratein the next several days. Many expect a rate cut by the endof this month, and interpreted moves in the overnight andcall markets as evidence that Bank of Japan officials feelthe economy's continued vigor gives them leeway to manage agentle slowing without slashing the discount rate right away.   &quot;Bank of Japan officials may be signaling they prefer touse call rates rather than the official discount rates tosustain growth,&quot; said Matthew Berlow, an economist at CreditLyonnais Securities Ltd. &quot;They're providing more money, butdoing it gradually.&quot;   Economists expressed surprise at the continued high levelof capital spending plans among Japanese companies. TheAugust survey showed that the major corporations revisedplans for investment in plant and equipment in the currentfiscal year to an increase of 7.9%, up from the 7.1% riseforecast in the previous survey.   This month's tankan also indicated Japan's labor shortagehas eased, that firms' purchasing prices have weakened andthat the nation's businesses don't plan major price increasessoon.</TEXT></DOC>
