The administration opponents pointed to a study by the GeneralAccounting Office, Congress' investigating arm, that found thesanctions policy poorly planned, relatively unenforced and porousenough to let millions of dollars continue to flow to Noriega'sregime.   ``There can be no doubt that our policy has beencounterproductive,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., chairman ofthe House Foreign Affairs economic policy subcommittee.   Because of fear of harming U.S. businesses still operating inPanama, the Reagan and Bush administrations have granted numerousexceptions to rules intended to bar payments to Noriega'sgovernment, he said. The aim was to protect business while forcingthe military strongman from power.   ``Since the administration was not fully committed to eithergoal, we have failed to accomplish either one,'' Gejdenson said.``We still have Noriega, and we have severely damaged both U.S. andPanamanian businesses and the economy of Panama.''   But Republicans on the subcommittee objected, saying any talk ofending the sanctions would only strengthen Noreiga. And they saidthe sanctions have had some effect, denying the regime some $125million in revenues last year, according to the GAO report.   ``The purpose of the sanctions was never to punish U.S.companies,'' said Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif. ``Exceptionswere made to prevent undue hardship on Americans living and workingin Panama.''   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., dismissed the entire hearing as ``aBush-bashing expedition by this committee.''   The sanctions grew out of riots in the summer of 1987, when theU.S. Embassy was damaged and U.S. military and economic aid toPanama were suspended. Later, Panama's lucrative quota for sellingsugar in the United States at subsidized prices was suspended, andWashington weighed in against new loans to Panama by internationaldevelopment banks.   Noreiga was indicted on drug charges in Florida early in 1988and the United States recognized Eric Arturo Delvalle as thecountry's legitimate president, and gave him control over frozenPanamanian funds in U.S. banks.   In June 1988, the administration sought to escalate thesanctions by barring payments by U.S. firms to the Noriegagovernment. Tax and trade-related payments were to be divertedinstead to a Federal Reserve Bank escrow account.   But even before the regulations for the new rules wereannounced, exceptions were being drafted. Eventually, some 46exceptions were granted that had the effect of letting more thanhalf the payments flow through to the Noriega regime, the GAO said.   In a related matter, the GAO also found that a mysterious $1million payment was released to Delvalle from a Federal ReserveBank account in New York after it was requested by Elliott Abrams,then the assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs.   The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which hadcontrol over the money, had objected to Abrams that the paymentfell outside the scope of a budget permitting the account to beused to pay operating expenses for Panama's U.S. Embassy and fiveconsulates.   But the money was permitted to flow after Abrams in effect tookresponsibility for the release of the funds, assuring Treasurycryptically that it was ``for appropriate official use by therecognized government of Panama.''   The GAO was unable to get from Abrams or the State Department anexplanation of the purpose of the money, said Frank C. Conahan,assistant comptroller general for national security andinternational affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
