Donald W. Brooks, Fairchild's president and chief executive officer, however, declined to identify the possible investors, other than to say they weren't other semiconductor companies. &quot;I've had several phone calls (offering financing) that I haven't even returned yet,&quot; he said during a news conference held here to explain Fairchild's options in the wake of Fujitsu Ltd.'s decision last Monday to drop plans to acquire the Cupertino, Calif.-based chip company.    Mr. Brooks also said that the Japanese electronics conglomerate, which abruptly withdrew its offer after U.S. Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldridge and other U.S. officials voiced opposition to the acquisition, wouldn't provide any financing for the proposed management buyout of Fairchild. It had been estimated that Fujitsu was prepared to pay $200 million for 80% of Fairchild; Fairchild didn't estimate the value of the management proposal.    Mr. Brooks said that if Schlumberger, an oil-field services concern controlled by French interests, went along with a management buyout, Fairchild wouldn't shed many assets or spin off any operations.    In New York, Schlumberger didn't rule out the possibility of a management buyout for Fairchild. &quot;That is among the alternatives we are looking at,&quot; said Arthur Lindenauer, Schlumberger's financial vice president, declining to elaborate. Schlumberger also said it had retained the services of Lazard Freres andamp; Co. to evaluate &quot;any and all proposals&quot; concerning the future of Fairchild.    Mr. Brooks said that Fairchild also would consider &quot;other alternatives&quot; to a management buyout, but that the main goal would be to &quot;hold the company together.&quot; In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing; ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    Mr. Brooks, who asserted that Fairchild and its employees were &quot;victimized&quot; by protectionist sentiment in Washington, said it &quot;was time for Fairchild to go forward to return Fairchild to a prominent position in the semiconductor industry.&quot; To that end, he described in general terms Fairchild's intent to pursue several joint ventures with Fujitsu to develop technology, to cooperate in manufacturing in both countries and to exchange licenses to make and sell each other's products.    The executive didn't conceal his frustration at the failed merger with Fujitsu, which he contended &quot;provided an avenue. . .for lessening U.S.-Japanese trade conflicts by providing more jobs in this country and more sales of U.S.-made semiconductors in Japan.&quot; He accused other U.S. semiconductor company executives of &quot;creating an air of hysteria&quot; over Japanese encroachment into the U.S. chip industry. Moreover, he added, &quot;I still don't think there was as much opposition in the government as was reported.&quot;    Meanwhile, in Washington, a House panel approved legislation giving the president new authority to prohibit foreign investors from buying U.S. companies.    The Energy and Commerce subcommittee on competitiveness voted 11-2 to authorize the commerce secretary to investigate whether a proposed takeover, acquisition or merger would &quot;impair the national security and essential commerce.&quot; Under the measure, the secretary would advise the president of his conclusions within 45 days, and the president then would decide whether to restrict or prohibit the proposed transaction. </TEXT></DOC>
