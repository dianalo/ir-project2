A charge of $24 billion,almost equal to GM's equity, would be the largest singlecharge any corporation has ever taken without some offsettingaspect. For instance, when RJR Nabisco was taken private in aleveraged buyout for about that amount, the buyers receivedan operation capable of generating substantial future income.What will GM get for its $24 billion?   GM is responding to a new accounting rule that requirescompanies to accrue the cost of retirement health benefitsbefore the employee retires. Since retirees or theirdependents may live more than 30 years beyond retirement, andmost of today's employees have 20 years to go beforeretirement, the accumulated health costs can be enormous. Thecomplex rule, issued about a year ago by the FinancialAccounting Standards Board (FASB), will affect almost everymajor U.S. corporation.</LP><TEXT>   Last March, IBM announced a quarterly loss for the firsttime ever, due to the new accounting rule, FAS 106. Althoughthe rule is not mandatory until 1993, IBM chose to adopt itearly, taking a $2.3 billion charge. A few months later,General Electric took a $1.8 billion charge for earlyadoption and in November Philip Morris announced a $1 billioncharge.   While the FASB encourages early adoption, few companieswill immediately follow IBM and GE. This newspaper recentlyreported a survey of major companies by A. Foster Higgins andamp;Co. that indicated that fewer than 6% were adopting the rulein 1991 and that many of these companies were spreading thecharge over a period of as much as 20 years. Half thecompanies have not decided when to adopt.   My own informal survey of companies in the Dow JonesIndustrials has yet to find a company that feels it has madea commitment of the extent the FASB rule implies, or that itneeds to. This a partial explanation not only for thereluctance to adopt the rule but also for the lack of moneyput aside for future payments. I would contend that mostcompanies need not fund the liability, at least not to thelevel the FASB rule suggests. For one thing, there is aquestion of whether there is a liability at all. Manycompanies extend health benefits to retirees but change themoften. Recent court cases indicate that the employers' rightto change or terminate the benefit will be upheld.   There is also the question of whether the retirees to whomthe benefits are extended really &quot;own&quot; anything. The employeehas probably seen his health-care benefit package changedramatically in the past 10 years and often knows that theretiree health package exists entirely at his company's will.Retirees who went before may have received some or all of thepayoff, but what will be left for the current employee whenhe is 80? What is the market value of an option on a chainletter?   The elusive nature of the benefit's value is neveraddressed by the FASB. The accounting rule is based onpension theory. Pensions, unlike retiree health insuranceplans, are required by law to be funded in advance -- and acompetitive market has developed to insure them. For asettlement price, an insurer will guarantee an annuity offuture payments to a company's pensioners. The pensionaccounting rule put out by the FASB several years ago closelymatches the market price mechanism. For retiree healthinsurance, however, no settlement market has developed.   The absence of insurers who will back the retiree healthliability has been attributed to the uncertainty and highcost attached to health care. But it is more likely a lack ofemployer demand. Why should an employer pay a lot to settle aliability it can reduce at will?   When there is little demand at a high price, the usualassumption is that the market price is lower. The FASBdisregarded this. It is ironic that on the day in 1990 whenthe FASB approved this rule, the Nobel Prize in Economicswent to financial economists who made commonplace anasset-pricing model that the accounting rule ignored. Such amodel might halve the GM billions, with greater proportionatereductions for other corporations.   FAS 106 not only overstates the value of future retirees'health benefits, but its complexity presents another hazard.Unlike a market value, the value a company assigns to futurehealth benefits can be wrong, either by mistake or by design,and nobody will much know. The FASB rule leaves loopholesthat let a company reduce or increase its cost almost as itwishes. One reason there has been little outcry about thisrule, considering its estimated financial impact, is thatsome consultants and managers know that by making minorchanges to the plans they can greatly reduce the FASB cost.   The ability to manipulate financial expenses is not onlyan indicator that the method is flawed; it is also badaccounting and raises the specter of suspect financialstatements. The FASB rule may result in financial reportsthat are wildly inconsistent from company to company and thatcan be fiddled with to hide other sins. As such, the rule isnot a positive addition to corporate management or a usefultool in understanding retiree health benefits.   The business community's resistance to this rule has alsobeen mitigated for two other reasons. First, the wholesubject is enormously complex, with time frames of 50 yearsor more, and the expertise needed to understand the situationis not always present. Second, there is some sense that weare getting our due.   We live in a time of deferral to crisis and our anxietiesprepare us for the worst. Among the purported crises of ourtime are the aging of America, the unending rise ofhealth-care costs, and the consequences of misguidedcorporate paternalism. When these three crises come togetherto affect one issue, as they do in retiree health benefits,it is not surprising that the negative impact will be great.Some people assume the financial impact must be enormous andleave it to &quot;experts&quot; to quantify. Others fear the complexityand deny the implications.   Information about the future is useful only when it allowsus to make better decisions today. Unless a 50-yearcommitment to retiree health benefits has been made, the bestthing a manager can do with the FASB rule is what thefinancial analysts have done so far -- ignore it, and get onwith the duty of deciding just what the corporate commitmentto health care is.   ---   Mr. Petertil, a consulting actuary in Oak Park, Ill.,advised the FASB Industry Task Force on FAS 106.</TEXT></DOC>
