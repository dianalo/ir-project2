At the close of the morning session, the Nikkei index, anaverage of 225 issues, was off 1720.13 points, or 5.7%, to28260.32. That was sharply below the previous intraday lowfor the year of 28830 on March 22.</LP><TEXT>   The stock market was undercut by the surging dollar. TheU.S. currency met little resistance as it jumped to 160.25yen late Monday morning, up from 158.35 yen late Friday inNew York.   That sent the stock market tumbling. Its slide also wasgreased by fears that Japanese insurance companies wouldbegin selling stock at the start of their new fiscal yearthis morning. A report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan'sleading economic daily, suggesting that life and casualtyinsurers -- among the country's biggest institutionalinvestors -- would reduce their Japanese stock holdingsappeared to be coming true, one stockbroker said Mondaymorning. &quot;They are selling already,&quot; she added.   The report magnified the market's troubles on Friday, whenfast-paced sell-offs by institutions trying to raise theircash positions by the end of the fiscal year compoundeduncertainty about the market's direction.   On Friday, the indicator plunged 1045.71 points, or 3.4%,to 29980.45, closing below the 30000-point level for thesecond time in March. On March 22, the index dropped to29843.34. The index lost 237.41 points Thursday.   Tokyo stock prices plunged in moderate trading Fridaybecause of fast-paced selloffs by institutions that raisedcash positions on the last trading day of fiscal 1990.Uncertainty about the market's future deepened.   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 1045.71 points to29980.45, closing below the 30000-point level for the secondtime in March.   In London, meanwhile, stocks fell as most investors closedexisting positions on the last trading day of the firstquarter and found little inspiration to trade anew.   Tokyo traders said volatile moves in the foreign-exchangemarket and higher yields on the bond market dried up buyinginterest. Meanwhile, the pace of decline in stock prices wasaccelerated by index-linked program selling by foreignbrokerate houses, traders said.   The Nikkei index, which ended the Friday morning sessionwith an 850.15-point loss, rebounded moderately inmidafternoon with the help of buying by some investment trustfunds. But the index tumbled again, to the intraday low of29827, in final rounds of sell-offs, before the averagecollected 150 points in the last 15 minutes of trading.   Volume on the first section was estimated at about 500million shares, down from 685 million shares Thursday.   Losers outnumbered gainers 866 to 133, while 93 issueswere unchanged.   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in thefirst section was down 59.37 points, or 2.59%, to 2227.48,after falling 20 points Thursday.   The second section index fell 37.45 points, or 0.97%, to3817.90. The index gained 11.10 points Thursday. Volume wasestimated at nine million shares, down from 10 million sharesThursday.   The market had seen small-capital stock prices pushed upby &quot;window dressing&quot; operations by some institutions, whichevaluate year-end values of their holdings according toFriday's close. These stock prices had been expected to addfurther gains Friday.   But such expectations were shattered when the market beganthe day with active selling by foreign investors. The strongselling pressure made institutions give up strategic buyingand begin reducing their positions instead, analysts said.   Dealers also refrained from buying Friday.   &quot;Every Japanese brokerage house couldn't do anythingbeyond remain on the sidelines because they knew that if theybought, they'd only be battered by heavy selling,&quot; saidYoshihiro Ito, general manager of stock trading at OkasanSecurities.   As the Nikkei index extended losses during Fridayafternoon, individual investors finally joined the sellingactivity, as prices fell to levels that require investors toplace additional margin, the official said.   Shin Tokoi, deputy general manager of stock trading atCounty NatWest Securities, said market expectations that theyen will weaken further and top the 160-yen level against thedollar was strong, despite the yen's temporal recovery in themiddle of the day.   The heavy selling by foreign investors and the continuallyweakening yen led some investors to blame Japanese politics,which are often poorly appraised by foreign nations.   Traders predict stock prices will drift at low levels thisweek.   &quot;The market has no strength for a strong rebound at themoment,&quot; one analyst said, adding that the Nikkei index willfluctuate around the 30000-point level this week.   High-technology shares, which advanced strongly this pastweek on expectations that these exporters will benefit fromthe yen's weakness, were targets of active profit-takingFriday.   Fanuc plummeted 320 yen to 7,450 yen ($2.05 to $47.62).Kyocera fell 210 yen to 7,560 yen. NEC dropped 50 yen to2,120 yen and Hitachi Ltd. declined 50 yen to 1,590 yen.   NTT rose 30,000 yen to 1,160,000 yen following thegovernment's announcement to freeze discussion over a breakupof the giant telephone company for five years, until 1995.But market sentiment was too sluggish Friday to respond tothe news widely, traders said.   In London, shares languished within a very narrow bandmuch of the day, as traders said participants were waitingfor the opening of a new quarter this week.   But an early weak start on Wall Street gave London sharesa fresh nudge lower, although traders said there wasn't muchbehind the drift downward.   Some traders said trading probably would remain sparseuntil fresh earnings and indicators were disclosed later thisweek.   &quot;We're not inclined to do anything just at the moment,&quot;said one dealer. &quot;I'm afraid there's a lot of market makerprice movement but not a lot behind it.&quot;   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share index was off15.1 points to 2247.9, and just above its late Fridayafternoon intraday minimum of 2245.5, but lower than itsmidmorning peak of 2271.   The Financial Times 30 share index fell 12.5 points to1768.7. Volume amounted to a sketchy 453.7 million shares,little changed from Thursday's 435.2 million issues.   In the extremely quiet market, dealers said there were fewoverall features to discuss. Many said a large part of anyprice movement among the major stocks came as a result ofmarket makers adjusting prices to see if they could lure somefresh buyers to the scene.   Among individual shares, British Steel gained 4 pence to144 pence (6.5 cents to $2.36). Analysts said the sharesgained after the company said that because of a pension fundsurplus, results for the next few years will be better thanexpected.   Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks giant, shed 11pence to 585 pence in mild profit-taking after a very strongsurge in the week, thanks to bullish news emerging fromanalysts' visits to the company's Burger King, Pearle Visionand Pillsbury operations in the U.S.   Pearson, the publishing conglomerate, climbed 4 pence to695 pence after saying that 1989 pretax profit gained 26%,beating market expectations. Polly Peck jumped 7 pence to 400pence on the back of strong earnings disclosed Thursday.   Elsewhere in Europe, prices closed higher in Brussels,Paris, Frankfurt, Milan, and Zurich, and mixed in Amsterdamand Stockholm. South African gold stocks closed lower.   Meanwhile, stocks ended down in Sydney, Singapore andWellington; and higher in Taipei and Seoul. Prices endedlittle changed in Manila and Hong Kong.
