Profit has been mediocre for two years.   Yet buying of the stock has begun, and could accelerate.</LP><TEXT>   Whatever the trial's outcome, analysts say, the stockprobably will rise. The verdict, expected later this month,will end 17 months of uncertainty that have scared WallStreet. &quot;The investment community would react very positivelyto the cloud being lifted,&quot; says Robert Roth of Merrill LynchCapital Markets.   Even if the company is convicted and pays a fine, Mr. Rothbelieves the stock will climb. A jail term for Mr. Grass orloss of pharmacy licenses would hurt the stock, but bothprospects are &quot;unlikely,&quot; he says. He rates the stock &quot;aboveaverage,&quot; with potential to outperform the market 10% overthe next 12 months.   Fans say the shares, at 36 3/8 Friday, could rise to thelow to mid-40s in the next year or so as profit rebounds nowthat an acquisition binge has been completed. There areskeptics, of course. At more than 13 times Street estimatesof current-year earnings, the stock is a &quot;hold&quot; in the viewof independent analyst Monroe Greenstein, who says: &quot;It's notoverpriced, but not cheap either.&quot;   Fidelity Investments purchased 1.5 million Rite Aid sharesin the first quarter, despite disappointing earnings and thetrial. &quot;We see both of those negative issues coming to an endand a lot of upside potential,&quot; says Larry Greenberg,assistant manager of Fidelity's Magellan Fund.   Says the manager of another fund, which recently acquired300,000 shares, &quot;Without the trial, this would be a $40 stockand we wouldn't be in it. How else could you buy a stock with15% growth potential so cheap?&quot;   Rite Aid has bought more than 700 stores since 1987,boosting its total to 2,360 stores in 22 states. Heavyexpenses for store remodeling and computer systems held thecompany's rise in profit from continuing businesses to only1% in fiscal 1989 and 3% in fiscal 1990, excluding one-timecharges.   Rite Aid got into legal trouble after acquiring more than250 stores in Ohio. In January 1989 the Ohio Board ofPharmacy fined the company $50,000 for allowingnonpharmacists access to prescription drugs. Rite Aidcomplained of unfair treatment. Then in April 1989, Mr. Grassand the corporation were charged with bribery for allegedlypaying about $33,000 to obtain the resignation of a pharmacyboard member in an alleged scheme to control the board. RiteAid denies any wrongdoing, contending that the payment was alegitimate buy-out of a consulting contract.   Most analysts believe that Mr. Grass, the 36-year-old sonof Rite Aid's chairman and chief executive officer, AlexGrass, will be acquitted. Even a conviction shouldn't hurtthe company's earnings recovery, says analyst Walter Loeb.With big acquisitions largely digested, Rite Aid's profit isstarting to pick up. After rising 8% in the first quarter,ended June 2, earnings are widely expected to rise 15%annually this year and next. Consensus pershare estimates are$2.65 for fiscal 1991 and $3 for fiscal 1992. For the yearended March 3, Rite Aid had profit from continuing operationsof $81.9 million, or $1.97 a share, after a 32-cent chargefor closing a video rental business.   &quot;No matter what happens, I think the stock will go up&quot; tothe low 40s within 12 months, Mr. Loeb says. He rates thestock a hold, but is considering a buy recommendation oncethe trial is over.   Analysts see one big risk if Rite Aid is convicted: Statescould try to revoke its pharmacy licenses. Oddly enough,there is less danger in Ohio than elsewhere. Ohio lawshaven't any provision for penalizing retail pharmacies forbribery or other nondrug crimes. The pharmacy board couldconceivably revoke Rite Aid's separate license as a wholesaledistributor of controlled substances. But an Ohio officialsays such action is &quot;unlikely&quot; and would have little, if any,effect on retail pharmacy operations.   In New York, where Rite Aid has 252 stores, conviction inanother state would be considered &quot;professional misconduct&quot;and could result in license revocation, says Charles Adams,executive director of the state Office of ProfessionalDiscipline. The state can investigate and recommend action tothe Board of Regents. (No action could be taken if Mr. Grasswere convicted but Rite Aid wasn't.) Pennsylvania law is lessclear. The state Board of Pharmacy probably would haveauthority to take action, most likely a fine or reprimand,says Michael Barrett, chief prosecutor for the state's Bureauof Professional and Occupational Affairs. His staff will givethe board a legal opinion following the trial.   ---   Rite Aid   (NYSE; Symbol: RAD)                                                                                                          Business: Drugstore Chain                                                                                                          Year ended March 3, 1990:   Sales: $3.17 billion   Net Income: $102.1 million*; $2.46 a share                                                                                                          First quarter, June 2, 1990:   Per-share earnings: 61 cents vs. 59 cents**                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume: 87,658 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 41.5 million                                                                                                          *Includes $22 million pre-tax charge related to departmentclosings.
