The study reports pressing shortages of technical,professional and secretarial workers at many companies,&quot;skills gaps&quot; that are causing high turnover, andfast-growing diversity in the labor pool.</LP><TEXT>   But managers aren't responding to the changes quicklyenough, the study suggests. It cites a lack of &quot;leading-edge&quot;recruitment and training strategies, as well as a scarcity ofprogressive &quot;support structures&quot; for women and minorityworkers such as day-care centers and mentor programs.   Conducted by the Hudson Institute, an Indianapolisresearch group, and Towers Perrin, a New York benefitsconsulting firm, the study is billed as the first majorfollow-up to the influential Workforce 2000 report issued in1987 by Hudson and the U.S. Department of Labor. That reportdrew much attention for its projection of radical demographicchanges. It predicted, among other things, that white maleswould constitute only 15% of net additions to the work forceby the year 2000, down sharply from 45% in 1985.   The new study, released yesterday, moves beyond itsforerunner by documenting work force changes that are takingplace now, and the ways that corporate America is reacting.   Qualified workers are in short supply at more than half ofthe surveyed companies. Scientists and technical workers arethe most elusive; some 70% of the surveyed companies arehaving difficulty recruiting them. Professionals in generalare also hard to get. And 55% of the companies surveyed saythey are having trouble finding secretaries and clerks.   All industries are suffering and expect problems to growmore severe, but the shortages are currently affectingindustrial, consumer products and health care companies worstof all, the study says. The most extreme problems: Some 89%of consumer products companies reported difficulty findingworkers with technical training, while nearly as many healthcare concerns can't find enough scientists.   The study doesn't cite specific companies, but manycorroborate the findings. At Schering-Plough Corp., aMadison, N.J., maker of medical products, worries about ashortage of scientists and engineers have helped prompt anupper-level management review of recruitment strategies andother issues related to Workforce 2000. Among other steps,the company will soon expand the number of colleges fromwhich it seeks promising candidates. &quot;We're trying to becomemore aggressive,&quot; says Linda A. Cardillo, director ofcorporate human resources.   But job fairs and other traditional recruitment techniquesare still more popular than the more unusual means that havegained considerable publicity in recent years, the studyfound. Although 39% of surveyed companies are boostingstarting salaries, fewer than one-quarter are rehiringretirees or recruiting the elderly, disabled and other&quot;nontraditional&quot; workers.   Companies also have been slow to make a strong commitmentto training the workers they do hire. Two-thirds of thesurveyed firms spend less than $2,000 for classroom and otheron-the-job education for first-year workers. That helpsaccount for high annual turnover rates, the study says. Halfof the surveyed firms reported about 28% turnover for newhires.   Other factors may alienate workers, too. One-fourth of allsurveyed companies said their corporate cultures weren't&quot;open to diversity,&quot; while 29% said discrimination was aproblem and 15% reported &quot;overt harassment&quot; of minorities asa concern.   Such results suggest that &quot;organizations' readiness tomanage the changing work force is mixed at best,&quot; the studysays.   The study indicates that diversity is already a reality atmany companies. Minorities constitute at least one-fifth ofthe work force at some 39% of surveyed firms, while womenmake up more than half the employees at 47% of the companies.   Still, just one-fourth of companies are trainingsupervisors in the complexities of managing &quot;a disparategroup&quot; of employees, the study says. Even fewer are adoptinginnovative ways to ease conflicts between work and family andlower the &quot;glass ceilings&quot; that many minority and womenworkers face.   While 42% of companies engage in &quot;explicit&quot; minorityrecruiting, for instance, just 12% train minorities forsupervisory positions. Only 11% have created minority supportgroups and 10%, mentor programs.   Meanwhile, 81% of surveyed companies have formal policiesbanning sexual harassment. But management training for womenexists at only 32% of firms, while 8% of companies havecreated support and mentor groups for women. Under one-thirdof companies offer extended maternity leave and just 15% haveon-site or nearsite day care.   &quot;You've got to be conscious that the work force ischanging,&quot; says Cliff Ehrlich, senior vice president forhuman resources at Marriott Corp., Washington. Marriott willbring together senior managers later this month for its firstcompanywide meeting on &quot;cultural diversity,&quot; which Mr.Ehrlich says will allow the sharing among divisions of ideasused &quot;only locally until now.&quot;   Many companies, Mr. Ehrlich adds, have been so preoccupiedwith slashing jobs that they haven't taken the time to worryabout remaining workers. But at the same time, he says, manycompanies haven't tackled the prospect of a changing workforce simply because the issues it presents are so new.   &quot;Our attitudes have all been forged in an era when laborhas been plentiful,&quot; he says. &quot;That's history, and no one'sreally sure what the other side looks like. It's tough to dosomething about things you don't know about.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
