At least 680 people have died since the floods started in Junewith the annual monsoon season, according to several Dhakanewspapers.   President Hussain Mohammad Ershad said on Wednesday the deathtoll was 250, but the government's count usually is considered low.   Dhaka, a city of 4 million, is virtually cut off from the restof the country. The Ministry of Communications said 18 highwaysleading out of the capital were closed to traffic because offlooding.   One-fourth of the city was under water ranging from a few inchesto several feet. No deaths have been reported in Dhaka.   Most of the flooding was in poor and middle-class neighborhoods,but by today the water had started seeping into the districts ofGulshan, Banani and Baridhara on Dhaka's northeast side, whereforeign diplomats and wealthy Bangladeshis live.   The small Bengali-language Khabar newspaper said a boat carrying100 flood refugees sank Wednesday in the Brahmaputra River 70 milesnorth of Dhaka and all aboard were feared drowned. There was noconfirmation of the report.   Police in Dhaka said they could not confirm the sinking, whichwas reported by none of the major newspapers. Telephone lines wereout to Mymensingh, the town nearest the reported sinking.   The Buriganga reached a danger level of 23 feet, 3 inchesWednesday night, according to the Flood Forecast and Warning Center.   The river, a tributary of the Ganges, has risen steadily aswaters from the already flooded north of the country surgedownstream toward the Bay of Bengal.   ``I had to take a boat ride to come to work,'' Abdul Jabbar, agovernment clerk said.   He said his house in Swamibagh on Dhaka's southern outskirts wasunder five feet of water. His family took refuge on the upper floorof a nearby two-story building.   Carpenters worked throughout the night building small boats totransport people. Some people improvised rafts from banana plantstalks and leaves.   On Wednesday, Ershad issued an international appeal for aid,including food, helicopters and rafts. He said his impoverishednation, where the per capita income is $150 a year, needed 2million tons of grain to face the emergency.   Last year, floods killed more than 1,500 people in Bangladesh.In 1985, more than 10,000 drowned when cyclones and tidal wavesswept over low-lying islands in the Bay of Bengal.   ``The flooding has made me a pauper, and my shop is closed forbusiness,'' Abdul Ahad, a grocer, said. He said nearly all hismerchandise, including bags of rice stored in his home, was ruinedwhen flood waters entered the building overnight.</TEXT></DOC>
