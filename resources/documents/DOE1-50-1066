The economic analysisof environmental pollution control starts from the production processesand assesses the emissions, then identifies the pollution-control technologyand the standards, estimates the costs of pollution control and appliesthe financial and economic analysis techniques to analyze the cost/benefitof pollution control for the project. An acceptable social discount rate,differing from the applied discount rate for the financial and economicanalysis, may be applied for the analysis of pollution control. The conclusionsfrom the case study of project analysis and environmental pollution controlfor the Expansion Project of the Shanghai Aluminum Plant indicate that:(1) The appropriate choice of technology transfer options between importedadvanced technology and utilization of abundant labor will increase totalfactor productivity in China; (2) A rational price system will ensurethat prices reflect cost efficiency and socially beneficial productionof profit and loss from investment in a project; (3) Labor hiring flexibilitywill allow the enterprise to dismiss idle or negligent workers and linkwages with labor productivity; and (4) An incentive pollution controlpolicy will encourage the industry to internalize pollution control costsor to consider possible cost reduction options.</TEXT></DOC>
