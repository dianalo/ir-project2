It may be going, going, gone.   The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to proposetoday that secondhand smoke be declared a known humancarcinogen, on a par with nine other pollutants such asasbestos and benzene. And the Labor Department's OccupationalSafety and Health Administration for the first time isconsidering looking into &quot;passive smoke&quot; as a work hazard.</LP><TEXT>   Such federal interest is likely to increase publicpressure for wider bans on workplace smoking. While mostearly efforts concentrated on segregating smokers at work orbanishing them to the lobby, moves for a &quot;totally smoke-free&quot;environment now are coming into vogue.   &quot;Five years ago, companies needed to be motivated even tolook at a smoking policy,&quot; says Robert Rosner, whosenonprofit Smoking Policy Institute in Seattle consults withbusinesses on smoking policies. Now many companies want to&quot;prohibit smoking even on the grounds {and} refuse to hireworkers who smoke.&quot;   At Turner Broadcasting System Inc., new hires must sign anagreement attesting that they don't smoke or that they willquit upon employment. The company is even considering goingfurther and banning smoking by all employees. But bans aretrickier than they sound. Anti-smoking policies run intoopposition from unions, as well as tobacco makers, and raiselegal questions such as how to enforce a ban.   Although the EPA report due out today doesn't break newscientific ground, because the agency and Surgeon Generalalready have branded passive smoking as causing lung cancer,both anti-smoking and pro-smoking forces say it will supplynew momentum for the ban-smoking movement. The EPA reportestimates that 3,800 additional cases of lung cancer a yearare caused by breathing other people's smoke. The agency alsois likely to release a draft of a guidebook for employers oncurbing workplace smoking.   The EPA report is &quot;going to be significant in our efforts&quot;to win restrictions or prohibitions on workplace smoking,says Angela Mickel, a lobbyist for Tobacco-Free America, agroup created by the American Cancer Society, American HeartAssociation and American Lung Association.   &quot;The tobacco prohibitionists are certainly on a march,&quot;says Thomas Lauria, a spokesman for the industry's TobaccoInstitute. Thanks to the EPA report, &quot;we're going to see themomentum for more restrictions on the workplace,&quot; he says.   The EPA itself can't regulate smoking. But Action onSmoking and Health (ASH), a Washington, D.C., group that hasfought many anti-smoking battles, says the agency's reportwill bolster its current court case against OSHA, which hastwice rejected petitions seeking &quot;emergency&quot; curbs onworkplace smoking. &quot;It puts an added burden on OSHA tojustify why they're not protecting employees from thishazard,&quot; says Kathleen Scheg, an ASH lawyer. The TobaccoInstitute's Mr. Lauria agrees: &quot;An official EPA edict wouldmake OSHA look at it even harder.&quot;   Indeed, Gerard Scannell, OSHA's activist-minded new chief,says he wants to raise the issue and indicates he'll rely onthe EPA report as a springboard. He says, &quot;I think we have todeal with the issue, but I need more information.&quot;Eventually, OSHA will probably put out a &quot;request forinformation,&quot; that could lead to rules on workplace smoking,he says, but &quot;it's down the road before we do anything.&quot;   But the anti-smoking movement isn't waiting for thefederal government. All but 13 states have laws restrictingsmoking in public or private workplaces. According toAmericans for Nonsmokers' Rights, a Berkeley, Calif., groupthat works for anti-smoking legislation, at least 297 citiesand counties restrict workplace smoking.   While the number of companies adopting anti-smokingpolicies seems to be hitting a plateau, there's a surge ininterest in total bans. A 1989 survey of private andgovernment employers by the Administrative Management Societyfound that 60% of employers surveyed restrict smoking and 25%of those ban it, up from a year earlier when 57% said theyrestricted smoking and 14% barred it.   The EPA study is already having an effect. After news ofit leaked into the press last month, Ted Turner, chiefexecutive officer of Turner Broadcasting, asked his managersto begin looking into a total ban on smoking for thecompany's 3,700 employees. The Atlanta-based company's policyof tobacco-free employees hired since November 1986 alreadyis one of the toughest around, and it's enforced. This year,a newly hired lawyer who somehow wasn't made aware of thepolicy lit up a cigarette in the office. She was given achoice of leaving her job or enrolling in a quit-smokingprogram. She ultimately left rather than quit smoking, saysWilliam Shaw, vice president of corporate personnel   In Akron, Ohio, Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. also isbeginning to explore the idea of toughening its restrictionson smoking by adopting a total ban at corporate headquarters.Goodyear's chief industrial hygienist, Joseph Holtshouser,says companies are being enticed to consider smoking bansbecause it's good not only for the employees' health butpotentially for the corporate bottom line. Statistics showthat smokers have higher rates of absenteeism, lowerproductivity and higher medical claims for themselves andtheir families.   While insurance companies generally have only begun tooffer discounts for nonsmokers on individual policies, KingCounty Medical Blue Shield in Seattle, Wash., broke newground this March by offering as much as a 15% discount ongroup health policies to employers that ban smoking and cancertify that 90% of their work force are nonsmokers.   Some other companies that now ban workplace smokingentirely or except for certain lounges or cafeteria areas,the Tobacco Institute says, include Ford Motor Co., in itsoffices; Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota; ManvilleCorp., in Denver and Manville, N.J.; Kansas Gas andamp; ElectricCo.; U S West, in eight Northwest and Midwest states; BoeingCo., in Seattle and Wichita, Kan.; Adolph Coors Co.; andDeluxe Corp., in 66 locations.   Tobacco companies are striving mightily to hold back thesmoking-ban movement, with partial success. The TobaccoInstitute has been able to help kill a number of state bills,for instance. Philip Morris Cos., meanwhile, isn't leaving itall to the institute. It's launched a campaign to challengethe EPA report, including a news conference here Friday, totout several studies that play down the significance ofsecondhand smoke.   Some of the industry's success has come in getting somestates -- Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, South Carolina andTennessee so far this year -- to pass laws variouslyprotecting workers from being fired or from hiringdiscrimination for smoking. The Tennessee law prohibits jobdiscrimination against those who use &quot;a legal agriculturalproduct&quot; off the job.   Tobacco interests have found some potent allies in laborunions, who oppose government-ordered curbs and unilateralemployer actions alike. Unions helped defeat a recentlyproposed Boston ordinance aimed at forcing employers to bansmoking when compromise solutions can't be found, and aMassachusetts bill with a similar goal. Unions complain thatsuch smoking limits undercut the collective-bargainingprocess, where accommodations should be worked out. They alsoaren't eager, some union officials say, to support edictsthat will anger many of their members.   Another pocket of resistance sometimes is in offices oftop corporate executives, even at companies with no-smokingpolicies. Chrysler Corp. bans smoking except in designatedareas, large work spaces such as garages and in privateoffices. The last exemption allows Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, atwo-cigar-a-day smoker, and top executive Robert Lutz, whoalso smokes cigars, to keep lighting up.</TEXT></DOC>
