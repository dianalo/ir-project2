<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-0450 </DOCNO><TEXT>A development history is presented for ISRO's monopropellant and bipropellantliquid-fuel rocket propulsion systems. These have included bipropellantengines employing hypergolic propellants and ablative chambers that havebeen employed as both single stages and multistage system sustainer stages.The monopropellant thrusters have found application in reaction-controlsystems for satellites and launch vehicles. Currently, film-cooled, regeneratively-cooled,and radiation-cooled engines are undergoing tests for application aboardthe Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, as well as for apogee propulsionof the Insat-II.</TEXT></DOC>
