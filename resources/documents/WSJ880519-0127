Senior government officials said the previously undisclosed, three-year investigation in Philadelphia focuses on allegations of fraud and false claims amounting to about $10 million. They said that the U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia and Justice Department officials here are expected to decide this summer -- perhaps as early as next month -- whether to ask a federal grand jury to indict GE.    The officials said that prosecutors also are weighing seeking charges against current or former officials of Management andamp; Technical Services Co., a GE unit in King of Prussia, Pa. GE said the unit's operations were merged with another GE unit since the investigation began.    In Fairfield, Conn., Bruce Bunch, a GE spokesman, confirmed that an investigation has been under way. In response to questions, he issued a company statement that said neither GE nor the unit have been formally named as a target of the inquiry. &quot;This matter was brought to our attention&quot; several years ago, according to the GE statement, but &quot;it is not resolved.&quot; The company declined to elaborate.    The inquiry by the Defense Department's criminal investigative service concerns a 1983 contract for 115 logistics computer systems installed in vans to help the Army keep track of supplies and vehicles in the field. Under the contract, which provides for payments totaling $250 million by 1997, GE also trains Army personnel to use the system and maintains the equipment.    Officials emphasized that a decision on whether to seek an indictment hadn't been reached, and one said it would be a &quot;close call.&quot; Federal prosecutors in Philadelphia and Washington, and Bruce Kovens, the special agent in charge of the Philadelphia area office of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, declined to comment.    GE is one of the country's largest military contractors. Any criminal charges could subject it to suspension from bidding on new government contracts. In addition, the company could face civil penalties. Earlier this month, GE won a $238.9 million contract to serve as the principal architect of the planned Strategic Defense Initiative, which seeks to develop systems to intercept ballistic missiles.    GE has been scrutinized in a number of criminal investigations in the past few years. In a much-publicized 1985 Philadelphia case, GE pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $1 million for defrauding the U.S. by illegally claiming cost overruns on Minuteman Missile contracts. The case helped spark congressional inquiries about defense-contractor abuses. Since then, GE has been a leader in advocating cooperation with the government through voluntary disclosure of improper billing practices.    The current investigation began before the company started pressing for such voluntary disclosure. It wasn't prompted by company disclosures of any irregularities, according to government officials and GE.    Government officials said that the criminal investigation was opened in 1985 after Defense Department auditors concluded that GE's Management andamp; Technical Services unit provided the Army with internal cost data that inflated the negotiated contract for the logistics computer systems by about $18 million.    Investigators now believe they can prove that the U.S. was overcharged by $8 million to $10 million. Civil fines and penalties could nearly double the company's liability, government officials said. </TEXT></DOC>
