 They also must assess the impactthat this integration will, in turn, have on the technology itself.andP;  Inparticular, corporations are looking to embed the inference capabilities oftoday's expert system shells within mainframe transaction processingenvironments like CICS and IMS/DC.andP;  The result: AI is no longer limited tothe PC; it is moving to the mainframe.andM;To reap the performance and data access advantages of embedding, manydevelopers are more than willing to sacrifice some of the exoticfunctionality and user interface niceties that until recently were considereda requirement for high-end shells.andP;  According to Joe Lavezzo, vice presidentof Technology Planning at New York-based American International Group, &quot;Theability to rside within, and invoke the resources of, a transactionprocessing environment, is overriding.&quot;andM;If there were a choice between, say, the capacity to reason aboutcounterfactual situations and the capacity to extract data from a VSAM filethrough CICS, there is no question that most of today's developers in thecommercial world would choose the VSAM access.andP;  While expert system embeddingcould potentially be accomplished in a number of ways, the current state oftechnology usually dictates that expert system code and database files besharply segregated.andP;  Since the bulk of the expert system code resides in mainmemory, integrators have to determine where and how to decompose a largedatabase into working memory for cooperative processing.andP;  As the size of thedatabase files grows, so does the urgency of the problem, since the expertsystem is called upon to extract the appropriate data very carefully.andM;One promising solution is the use of expert system-type rules to optimize thenavigation path through the targeted files.andP;  In addition to the technicaldifficulties, the integration of expert systems and database managementsystems pose a host of organizational conundrums.andP;  Since management of thecentralized database typically resides with MIS organizations while expertsystems are generally owned by end-user groups, the full-fledged integrationof the two technologies will require either increased MIS responsibility forend-user computing or distributed approaches toward data ownership.andM;From PC to MainframeandM;We estimate that there are approximately 2,200 fielded expert systemapplications in North America.andP;  Of these, almost half were developed, andapproximately 60% delivered, on IBM PCs or PC-compatibles.andP;  While the Lispmachine (computers with an architecture optimized to process Lisp codeefficiently) is the second most popular platform for both development (24%)and delivery (14%), all signs point to its gradual extinction in thecommercial world.andM;Robert Wendell, AI program manager of Lincoln National Corp., Ft.andP;  Wayne,Ind., agrees.andP;  &quot;Whatever advantages a Lisp machine might exhibit for thepurposes of pure Randamp;D, the architecture's inability to link up withconventional hardware, coupled with its rather steep expense, makes it anunacceptable platform for the development and, especially, the delivery ofcommercial, data-intensive applications.&quot;andP;  Even the two most prominent Lispmachine vendors, Symbolics Inc. and Texas Instruments, have shifted theirstrategic emphasis from proprietary computers toward chips and software thatenhance Lisp performance.andM;The predominance of the PC as the platform of choice for expert-systemdevelopment and deployment in commercial settings is largely a function ofthe departmental orientation of much AI activity in the mid-1980s.andM;It is no accident that the initial acceptance of these PC-based systemscoincided with the heyday of the information center or that the preponderanceof early knowledge-based system experiments occurred in the lines ofbusiness, rather than under the sway of MIS.andP;  The theoretical ability ofthese PC systems to mimic human thought processes seemed to provide thekeystone for the arch of end-user computing.andP;  Not only did knowledge-basedsystems promise the realization of a seamless man-machine interface, but theyalso seemed tailor-made for truly intelligent automated decision support.andM;Given that knowledge-based system technology exerted its initial appeal tomiddle management engaged in front-line business activities, it is notsurprising that the lion's share of today's deployed systems are mounted onPCs.andP;  In fact, the majority of systems in the New Science ApplicationsDatabase (a quarterly updated database of fielded expert systems) arePC-based.andM;There are forces at work, however, that may dislodge the PC from itspreeminent position in the world of commercial expert systems.andP;  Ray Gleske,technology analyst in the applied Randamp;D department of the Information SystemsDiv.andP;  of Society Management Co., Cleveland, says, &quot;In addition to increasingproductivity, the preservation and distribution of corporate knowledge arecentral goals of our internal AI strategy.andP;  The fact that the mainframe is arepository for much of that corporate knowledge makes it key to theachievement of our goals.&quot;andM;Exemplifying this brave new world of mainframe-based systems is theComprehensive Life Insurnace Underwriting Expert System (CLUES) developed andmaintained by the Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York (MONY), New York.andO;Because CLUES was developed and delivered on a mainframe, it has beenpossible to embed it into a number of MONY production systems.andM;In January 1987, MONY had completed the installation of a large conventionalsystem called the New Business System (NBS), a CICS/DL/1 application.andP;  Thesystem issued policies automatically after the appropriate data had beenentered and the application underwriter had given approval.andP;  Unfortunately,the approval process was far from automatic and relied heavily on humanintuition and judgment.andM;MONY engaged in a number of joint application design (JA) sessions and otherinternal studies to determine just what would be required of an expert systemdesigned to automate the approval process.andM;The company sent out requests for proposals and Palo Alto-based Teknowledgewas selected to carry out the project.andP;  Systems consulting firm AmericanManagement System, Arlington, Va., was brought in to help on mainframeintegration and the deadline was set for April 30, 1987.andM;While Teknowledge recommended using only one domain expert (an expert in thefield being automated), MONY decided to use three, whose specialties providedcomplementarity.andP;  Teknowledge also brought in several knowledge engineers.andM;CLUES was built in Teknowledge's mainframe-based S-1 tool, using a rule-basedknowledge representation language.andP;  Teknowledge devised a way to generatetest cases by creating a variant of a base case.andP;  In this way, a test base of4,500 cases was built and used for pilot testing, which eased the validationprocess that began on April 30, 1987.andP;  Between April and September 1987,CLUE's developers created a &quot;model office&quot; that effectively double-checkedall applications processed by MONY's selection department.andM;By September '87, CLUES was fielded as a &quot;live&quot; production system and wasused by half of MONY's local underwriting agencies.andP;  By the end of the year,the other half went into training, and by April of last year, all agencies(about 80) had gone on-line with CLUES.andP;  The knowledge base continous to beperfected.andP;  Whenever underwriters override a CLUES-generated decision, thedata is fed back into the system.andP;  CLUES was designed to function as acomponent of the coordinated information and administrative network linked toMONY's mainframe computer in its Syracuse Operations Center.andM;After being mailed from local insurance agencies, applications are enteredmanually into NBS.andP;  (MONY is currently testing a pilot system calledFAST--field application submit transaction--which, if proven, will permit aMONY agent to enter applications to NBS remotely.)andP;  Once information isstored in NBS, it is necessary to search a variety of files for data relevantto the application.andP;  The search includes queries to the Medical InformationBureau and the Total Online Policyholder System, which tracks active policiesand stores them by policy number.andM;When the relevant data is captured, it is sent to CLUES, which assesses theapplication's viability.andP;  Approximately 40% of the medical cases are approvedright away.andP;  Approval consists of a &quot;release&quot; transaction sent to NBS, whichin turn generates several further transactions.andP;  First, a message is sent tothe appropriate agency notifying it that the case has been approved, then thecase information is sent to another system that formats the policy text.andP;  Thetext is printed on a laser printer and express-mailed to the agency.andM;For the balance of cases not immediately approved by CLUES, underwriters haveto do a CLUES-assisted &quot;screen review&quot; process.andP;  The system assigns the casesto individual underwriters, making appropriate adjustments for theirrespective workloads and authority levels.andP;  Cases are thus queuedautomatically and appear in a list on the correct underwriter's terminal.andM;During the screen review, the underwriter has the option of overriding aCLUES decision not to approve a given application.andP;  If this happens, as itdoes in 15% of cases, the underwriter must type in the reason, then generatea release transaction to be sent to NBS.andP;  The approval process then proceedsas described above.andM;If the underwriter requires additional information before deciding whether ornot to override CLUES, the case goes into a pending file and local agents areasked for additional data.andP;  The case is not resubmitted to CLUES and the restof the process is carried ouit manually.andM;MONY's commitment to high technology and increased application volumes at thecompany paved the way for CLUES' widespread acceptance.andP;  The corporation'schief underwriter was a champion of the project from the early stages, and,as a result, many workers willingly put in extra hours toward isinstallation.andM;Expert System TrendsandM;While the number of mainframe-based expert system applications in productionis still comparatively small (about 5% of the total), the mainframe shellmarket is growing dramatically.andP;  There are three main reasons for this.andM;First, as is the case with other business computing endeavors, the need tohave access to corporate data is increasing.andP;  As Ray Gleske of SocietyManagement Co. indicates, a good deal of the information needed for effectivecomputer use resides on the corporate mainframe.andP;  Society is working onapplications to assist branch office personnel in processing and evaluatingsmall commercial loans.andP;  While using the PC as a development platform, Gleskeforesees the need for an eventual mainframe implementation to obtain therequired access to information in corporate databases.andM;Second, far from placing computing power directly in the hands of businessprofessionals, the proliferation of expert systems could foster a whole newclass of professionals, poised between MIS and the lines of business.andP;  Thecosts of supporting this new class could theoretically be offset by thesavings resulting from the ability to preserve expertise beyond the life spanof individual experts and by the increased productivity that would resultfrom the use of these systems.andM;These savings are theoretical, however, and costs are all too tangible.andP;  Anincreasingly attractive alternative is to retrain data center professionalsto perform AI-related tasks.andP;  Since it is only natural for these &quot;made-over&quot;prorammers to prefer the mainframe environment, their growing numbers havefueled the already hot mainframe shell market.andM;Third, with the increasing complexity of hardware configurations and softwaresystems, MIS has begun to feel the need for knowledge-based systemtechnology.andP;  The application of such systems to data-center problems isconvincing a number of companies that the data center is a great place tostart applying AI.andM;Three areas of application that are receiving the most attention areautomated help desks, system performance analysis, and automated operations.andM;An automated help desk is an application that provides generic informationabout initiation or the circumvention of interruptions to routinecomputer-related tasks performed by an end user.andP;  In the entire scheme ofthings, a help desk can be best looked upon as the best starting point interms of lowest risk and ease of implementation.andM;An expert system is the usual form of an automated help desk, where one ormore experts contribute to the knowledge behind the system; but there is agrowing number of help desks in the form of knowledge-based systems, whereprocedures manuals and on-line access to other applications contribute to theknowledge base.andM;Performance analysis is another area that lends itself to knowledge-basedsystems.andP;  Tending to DASDs and cpus can be time-consuming and, frankly,imprecise.andP;  There are many rules of thumb that operators and analysts haveconcocted over years of working with computers and their subsystems.andP;  The useof knowledge-based systems to capture and store these words of wisdom canmean the difference between a smooth-running or crashed system.andO;Unfortunately, the rote application of performance analysis rules of thumbhas short-lived validity in a world or rapidly evolving hardwareconfigurations.andP;  Consequently, developers of these systems must build in goodcontrol structures, and very modular knowledge bases.andM;One way around this is to use one of the AI-based (or soon-to-be AI-based)performance analysis tools on the market.andP;  Tools such as DASD Advisor fromBoole andamp; Babbage and MindOver MVS from Computer Associates can provide thebasic analysis functions: a user need only customize the tools to thecompany's specific computer configuration.andM;The third area of opportunity in data center AI is automated operations, or,as it is more affectionately called, lights-out operations.andP;  MIS's goals forunattended computer operations are slowly becoming reality.andP;  One of the moreattainable is the reduction and control of messages to the operators'consoles.andM;With the number of system components per network on the rise, coupled withthe ever-increasing complexity of that hardware, operators will be seeingmore and more messages on their consoles.andP;  Some of these messages aretrivial, such as &quot;The tape is loaded,&quot; but others are more critical: &quot;Theswapping space is now at 99.9% capacity.&quot;andP;  A knowledge-based system that cananalyze, filter, and route incoming messages is very vulnerable.andM;While mainframe shells lack the attractive end-user interfaces of smallertools, they excel at database access.andP;  The relational data model is perhapsmost naturally fitted into the programming paradigms associated withknowledge-based system technology, but most available mainframe shells allowdevelopers to draw data directly from a variety of DBMS files, including VSAMand IMS, and DB2 and SQL/DS.andM;Palo Alto-based Aion's ADS and Waltham, Mass.-based AI Corp.'s KBMS typifytwo very different approaches to database access.andP;  While ADS requires thedeveloper to write code within ADS that accesses each DBMS separately, KBMSallows the developer to represent files from any DBMS through a uniformobject-oriented structure.andP;  Once &quot;translated&quot; into the object-orientedformat, data from these variously sourced files may be combined and accessedvia a language syntactically identical to SQL.andM;Performance is another issue that must weigh heavily on the minds ofmainframe shell application developers.andP;  Aion's AIDS permits full compilationof knowledge bases through its High Performance Option.andP;  The effect of suchcompilation is not only to ensure maximum performance on the part of ADSapplications, but also to minimize the performance impact that an ADSapplication might have on other subsystems that co-reside on the samemainframe.andP;  In its current release,  KBMS's compilation capabilities arerestricted to permitting a translation of an application's rule set intooptimized form for faster interpretation.andM;Sharing the Load Among MachinesandM;What will the role of PCs be in this brave new world of mainframe shells?andP;  Inaddition to serving as platforms for prototyping and for small applicationsnot requiring the power or data available from the big iron, it is likelythat many PC-based expert systems will cooperate symbiotically with theirmainframe cousins.andM;AIG has recognized the importance of cooperative processing.andP;  While currentlyconcentrating on building PC applications intended for mainframe, Lavezzoindicates thet goal is to combine the processing capabilities of PC andmainframe &quot;to merge both environments into a unified solution.&quot;andP;  This is farmore than a technical issue.andP;  AIG has numerous small offices worldwide, eachwith varying hardware configurations.andP;  In designing AI solutions, AIGrecognizes the importance of making available a portfolio of choices adequateto the varied environments servicing its user community.andM;The growing significance of mainframe and cooperative solutions haseffectively increased MIS influence on the development and deployment ofexpert systems.andP;  A recent survey conducted by New Science Associates, SouthNorwalk, Conn., shows that approximately 35% of the advanced technologygroups in Fortune 500 companies are explicitly turning over responsibilityfor expert system development activities to MIS departments.andP;  Both theapplications chosen for realization and the platforms on which theseapplications will sit are increasingly being dictated by the needs andlimitations of centralized IS.andM;While the ultimate impact of the increasing MIS influence is still unclear,the very respectability of knowledge-based system technology puts it on equalfooting with other long-accepted modes of information processing.andP;  Lackingaccess to the flow of Randamp;D funds, a projected expert system will have tocompete for scarce resources development.andM;On the other hand, the ability to interact with the considerable resources ofthe corporate mainframe environment promises not only to enhance the system'sability to serve organizational needs, but also to secure the role ofknowledge-based-system technology as an essential tool in corporateinformation processing systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
