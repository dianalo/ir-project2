Freedberg (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MNR </CO><IN> PHA </IN><DATELINE> BOYNTON BEACH, Fla.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some 1.5 million Americans live in nursing homes. This is a look at a week in the life of one such place.    Since its opening nearly three years ago, the Manor Care Nursing Center here has gained a reputation as one of the better nursing homes in Florida. The cheery, 120-bed facility is set on 3.3 acres in this upscale subdivision, 30 miles north of Fort Lauderdale. It is owned by Manor HealthCare Corp., a subsidiary of Manor Care Inc., a publicly traded nursing-home chain based in Silver Spring, Md. The company, which caters to private-paying patients, operates 143 facilities in 23 states.    The state of Florida rates the level of care here as &quot;superior.&quot; Staffing ratios are 30% to 40% above state government requirements. The amenities -- and cost -- also are well above average. But this is an institution, filled with patients who've lost their health and some who've lost their minds. Almost none want to be here.    A week's visit here last month says a world about old age. It suggests some of the problems of caring for the elderly and some of the reasons health costs continue to soar. It shows that a nursing home is its own world that puts unusual strains on patients, staff and even visitors. Given all the demands on the place, the most surprising thing is that it works at all.    MONDAY,   Dec. 7:   &quot;I love your eyes, your wonderful eyes,&quot; 94-year-old Edward Barnard sings as he rolls his wheelchair up behind Mary Long, the center's contagiously enthusiastic activities director. Mrs. Long, 30, smiles tolerantly. Mr. Barnard, a wealthy, former real-estate developer who sings all day long, admits he has a crush on her.    It's 9:30 a.m. The bulletin boards near the nurses' station on each floor say the weather is &quot;sunny&quot; and &quot;warm.&quot; The boards also show the day, date, season and next holiday. Some staffers call them &quot;reality boards.&quot;    There are 115 patients -- 95 women and 20 men, reflecting the reality that women outlive men. The youngest patient is 71; the oldest is 98. Two couples are dating.    The $3.7 million building has three wings and two floors. The more disoriented people live on the second floor. The beige stucco building is clean, fresh-smelling and carpeted. Pictures of dancers and musicians are bolted to the floral-papered walls. At the daily meeting of department heads, Administrator Melvin Falley announces that one patient has lost $27, another a small radio. He thinks one is an instance of confusion, the other of theft.    Admissions Director Ann Andreacchio reports that another patient has run out of money after about a year here, forcing her onto Medicaid. That means a transfer from the fancy Coral Wing to a less-expensive bed. Of Manor Care's 27 Medicaid patients, 25 originally paid privately.    At noon, Mrs. Andreacchio says she will admit a 78-year-old, onetime health-spa afficionado with severe arthritis of the spine. He will join his wife of 46 years, Dora, who has been a patient about two years. (He requested that their name not be used.) The staff thinks she has Alzheimer's disease. They say she is a &quot;wanderer.&quot; Just now, she is wandering through the second-floor halls.    Dora, who's 76 and has short black hair and a sweet tooth, shuffles past an ex-schoolteacher who struggles to free herself from a belt tying her to what looks like an adult highchair mounted on small wheels. &quot;O.K.! Line up! We're all getting out of here!&quot; the teacher announces.    Ahead, a 93-year-old heiress with a bouffant hairdo and whiskers on her chin ignores the wanderer and hugs her teddy bear, whom she introduces as &quot;Booby Rockefeller.&quot; Muzak fills the hall.    Farther on, a lady whoops, &quot;Ride 'em cowboy!&quot; to no one in particular.    Another woman repeats: &quot;This is Monday, Dec. 7, 1987. This is Monday, Dec. 7, 1987. This is Tuesday. This is Monday . . .&quot;    This is aging. &quot;All your life you've had the big outdoors and you've been free, and suddenly your whole world narrows and you're totally dependent on strangers,&quot; says nurse Mary Fisher.    Joyce Quinlan, a psychologist who frequently visits her 89-year-old mother at Manor Care, says families often feel a mixture of anger, guilt and relief when they place a loved one in a nursing home. About 40% never adjust, and she admits to her own misgivings.    There is a full moon tonight. In Room 217, Florence Crick, a 90-year-old, former bank secretary from Ireland, already is asleep. Staffers find that strange and wonder if she has had a small stroke. Usually, she would be wandering room to room, searching for her dead brother Billy.    Down the hall, Room 206 is filled with daisies, roses and chrysanthemums. Jean Rabin, a 72-year-old cancer patient, seems to be fighting death -- strained &quot;like a taut rubber band,&quot; says chief nurse Jacqueline Lynch -- despite intravenously administered morphine and other narcotics. Her sister from New Jersey, Florence, tries to comfort her.    Just three weeks earlier, Mrs. Rabin had asked the nurses to leave a fatal dose of pills in her room. They refused but promised to keep her comfortable. Now some of them are amazed by her refusal to close her eyes for fear of dying. &quot;I've never seen a person turn around like that and fight so hard to stay alive,&quot; says Mrs. Lynch, a nurse for more than 30 years.    TUESDAY,   Dec. 8:   At 6 a.m., nurse Helen Rhodus, a warm, 46-year-old widow, makes rounds with a blue cart of heart medicines, anti-depressants, nutrition supplements, laxatives, tranquilizers and narcotics. Among her patients is George Walter, her father, a 274-pound stroke victim who brightens when she brings him a cup of coffee and kisses him good morning.    Jean Rabin is still fighting to live. Shortly after 4, while her sister is out making funeral arrangements, she grabs a rose near her bed. &quot;This is life,&quot; she tells Dawn Baas, a special hospice nurse called in by the nursing center. &quot;When I'm gone, I'm nothing but dust.&quot;    &quot;You can go,&quot; the nurse replies, holding her hand. &quot;You can close your eyes, relax and let go.&quot;    Mrs. Rabin shuts her eyes. Almost immediately, she dies.    Later her sister returns and nurse Baas informs her of the death. The sister, exhausted and teary-eyed, asks: &quot;Did she say anything?&quot; Then she goes into the room to say goodbye.    Medical technicians remove the body through the ambulance exit. Housekeepers in pink and white uniforms prepare for a &quot;terminal cleaning&quot; with a disinfectant called &quot;Mikro-Quat.&quot;    At 8 p.m., the center's canary and three parakeets chirp away in Mary Long's activities room, where she and Ethel Mullen, an 80-year-old, thrice-widowed ex-telephone operator, are making Christmas decorations. Word of Mrs. Rabin's death has already reached them. &quot;You rejoice at a death and cry at a birth,&quot; Mrs. Mullen says, quoting her mother. &quot;A child is born into a wicked world, and an old person goes to a better place.&quot;    Miss Crick, the 90-year-old spinster who fell asleep early yesterday, refused to eat dinner this evening. At 9 p.m., a doctor examines her and orders tests. Just after midnight, nurse Rhodus checks in and finds Miss Crick on &quot;just about her last gasp.&quot; Within minutes, she is dead.     WEDNESDAY,    Dec. 9:   It's Nellie Taylor's 88th birthday. The staff sends her red and blue balloons. Her daughter and grand-daughter, frequent visitors, join her in the banquet room for a special meal. Mrs. Taylor will talk about it for days.    In the main dining room, where normally only a fourth of the patients eat lunch, today's offering is a three-bean and egg-salad platter. It is the biggest meal and main event of the day. Three residents arrive an hour early and peek through the doors, watching the staff get ready.    People who can't feed themselves are fed in the &quot;problem dining room&quot; or in their own quarters. Five patients require liquid tube feedings, which cost about $800 a month each. Administrators, who are required by state law to force-feed patients who can't or won't eat, are wrestling over what to do with one semicomatose tubefeeder. Her sisters stopped paying her bills to protest the doctor's tube-feeding order. The administrators say they may have no choice but to send her to a nursing home catering to indigent patients.    Costs are a constant concern. A private room, covering bed and board for a month, costs $2,940. Doctors' bills, lab services and physical therapy are extra. An average pharmacy bill runs $200 a month. Incontinency-care charges can add as much as $94.50 a month, and personal laundry (for those not living in the Coral Wing, where such services are included) costs $36 a month. Four women each spend about $7,200 a month for private-duty nurse aides who give one-on-one care that many nursing-home residents need and hardly any can afford.    Administrators blame the high cost of care on such factors as rising salaries, which they say account for as much as 60% of expenses. They say a nationwide nursing shortage forces them to pay bonuses for qualified help. But even at this price, there are shortcomings.    &quot;It's impossible to give everybody close care,&quot; says Mrs. Rhodus, who has three aides to cover a 60-bed floor. &quot;On a busy night, it can be horrendous.&quot;    On this night, in the second-floor &quot;problem dining room,&quot; aide Debra Wilson is feeling a bit &quot;like a yo-yo&quot; as she feeds two ladies dinner at once and encourages a third. None have appetites. &quot;Come on Rose-you're not a bird,&quot; she coaxes in a stern but jocular voice, using applesauce, Rose's favorite food, to hide the meat. Mrs. Wilson, a 32-year-old mother of two, holds three jobs. This one pays $4.80 an hour to start.     THURSDAY,    Dec. 10:   At the 9:30 meeting, Jo Ellen Vargulick, the director of nursing, announces that an aide has been struck by a patient. Another patient has been found lying on the floor with a cut lip. Two patients will go home next week. Based on past statistics, about 44% of the residents eventually will go home.    About 10 a.m., Ethel Mullen stands behind her wheelchair and maneuvers it through the front doors for her morning &quot;prayer walk.&quot; She picks up trash on a short stretch of concrete outside the center, places it in a plastic bag tucked under her chair cushion, puffs on generic cigarettes and utters a prayer for the residents of Manor Care. Then she goes back inside and waters plants.    About 2, the center's chef drives Mrs. Mullen to the funeral chapel where Miss Crick, it turns out, had arranged all the details five years ago. Everybody makes funeral plans before they come here, but nobody remembers any quite this elaborate: Miss Crick is laid out in a pearl-gray metal casket that matches the one in which her brother Billy was buried eight years ago. She wears a silky blue dress and her fingernails are painted the same color as her two bouquets of roses, placed head and toe. For tomorrow's last ride to the Boca Raton Mausoleum, she even hired a police motorcycle escort.     FRIDAY,    Dec. 11:   After lunch, a Christmas choir from nearby Carver Middle School moves some residents, staff and family members to tears. Two of the teen-age students cry, too. One says she is happy because she cheered some lonely old people; the other says she is sad because her grandfather died in a nursing home.    At 3, Mrs. Long oversees &quot;Happy Hour,&quot; a weekly celebration that today features Mrs. Mullen's popcorn and dancers from a nearby retirement condo. Off-duty nurse Mrs. Rhodus shows up in jeans, joining her mother, Rose Walter, who's here on her daily visit to her husband. &quot;I'll never quite accept the fact that he's here,&quot; Mrs. Walter says, adding that she feels lucky to have her daughter watching over things.    Late at night, Darlene Lahti, a private-duty aide, tries to describe for a reporter what 27 years of nursing the elderly have taught her. She scrawls the following in red ballpoint on a diaper: &quot;Two of these at night for protection. This takes the place of satin sheets, silk pj's, that comfortable granny gown, fine sleepwear and loving arms to dream in. These are not the golden years. These are the rusty years.&quot;     SATURDAY,    Dec. 12:   Dora, the &quot;wanderer,&quot; is eager to go out in the sun. The nurses, concerned that she'll wander off, say they'll let her husband take her only if she's tied to a wheelchair. About 30% of the people here are restrained through doctors' order, which is fewer than in many homes. Without more staff, administrators say they have no choice but to restrain kickers, scratchers or biters from harming themselves or others.    Dora's husband reluctantly accepts the nurses' direction. Skipping bingo in the dining room and a showing of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; in the day room, the couple goes out. But Dora soon starts to cry and the two come back inside. Her husband says it's because she hates being tied up.    With the weekend, visitors increase. Several people pick up family members for outings. (About a third of the patients get frequent family visits.) A woman with two corgis arrives, and, as she does every Saturday, takes the dogs room-to-room so patients can pet them.     SUNDAY,    Dec. 13:   The heiress with the bouffant hairdo is chuckling as her new stuffed animal, a battery-operated dog named Fido, performs flips for a nurse. In the Briney Breezes day room, the ex-schoolteacher in restraints is demanding to know how they got Mary Poppins to fly.    &quot;If you don't have a sense of humor here, you'd be dead,&quot; says Ethel Mullen, who is waiting for a visit from a friend. &quot;You just have to learn to joke about it or to turn your head the other way.&quot;    Down the hall in his office, the 65-year-old administrator, Mr. Falley, discusses the problems of running a nursing center. &quot;Things are never going to be the same as home,&quot; he says. Mr. Falley says that given the limited resources, his center does a good job. But he also says he hopes he never has to live in a nursing home.    ---                      Who Are They?
