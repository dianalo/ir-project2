The government also claimed that unidentified non-students whooppose communist rule have been advising student protesters frombehind the scenes, and it suggested that leading dissident FangLizhi might be one of them. Fang denied involvement.   The accusation seemed to herald government action againstliberal thinkers admired by students. Such action against Fang andother leading independent intellectuals followed student protestsin 1987.   ``Our protest tomorrow will show that Chinese democracy hasarrived at a new stage,'' said student leader Wu'er Kaixi of theBeijing Normal College.   Thursday is the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, thefirst pro-democracy student protests in China.   ``Tomorrow we shall carry out a great protest with the supportof the people,'' Wu'er said. ``May Fourth is a people's holiday.''   About 60 journalists for state-run newspapers announced plansfor their own protest Thursday to express anger over censorship,especially tight controls over what they have been allowed to sayabout the student protests.   The protests began April 15 and are the biggest in 40 years ofcommunist rule, but most papers are limited to printing only brief,understated reports on the events provided by the official XinhuaNews Agency.   Tens of thousands of Beijing students have joined in marches,sit-ins, pamphleteering and a class boycott to press their demandsfor democratic reforms. Students in a half-dozen other cities haveheld smaller marches; some students in Tianjin and Shanghai haveboycotted class.   The general secretary of the Communist Party, Zhao Ziyang, todayaddressed a handpicked audience of thousands of youths at a MayFourth celebration in the Great Hall of the People. He praised the1919 protests for their contribution to China's advancement, but hesaid stability is what the country needs now.   ``If stability is destroyed, what can be achieved?'' he said.``Can science and democracy be achieved? They cannot. All that willresult is turmoil.''   Police said they would close central Tiananmen Square onThursday, apparently in an effort to head off another demonstrationthere.   Last Thursday, about 150,000 students and their supporters brokethrough police lines into the square, China's symbolic seat ofpower.   Students from several other cities also said they plannedmarches Thursday in solidarity with the Beijing students' demandsfor a free press, an end to official corruption and other reforms.   Government spokesman Yuan Mu today rejected demands from thestudents to recognize their new independent group, the UnitedAssociation of Beijing Universities, and meet with members. Protestleaders had said if the government rejected the demands, they wouldmarch.   Yuan told a news conference he hoped the students would notstage a protest, but he refused to say what action would be takenif they did. He repeated the government's assertion that theassociation and student unions set up on individual campuses areillegal.   ``Behind the students are a very few people ... Trying to createsocial disturbances,'' Yuan said. ``They try to accomplish duringdisturbances goals that they cannot attain in circumstances ofpolitical stability.''   He stopped short of directly accusing Fang, an internationallyrenowned astrophysicist, of advising the protesters but hequestioned Fang's patriotism:   ``The role Mr. Fang wants to play in the current disturbanceswill be decided by his words and deeds.''   Fang, who has called for multiparty democracy, deniedinvolvement in the protests.   Yuan ``knows I have never been to Tiananmen Square, never beento Beijing University in the last few weeks,'' he said in atelephone interview.</TEXT></DOC>
