The Space, Science and Technology Committee on Friday, in a20-11 vote, rejected the minimum-funds amendment offered by Rep.Ron Packard, R-Calif., for the $4.4 billion superconducting supercollider.   Committee members also voted 16-14 against an alternative thatwould have required the secretary of energy to report to thecommittee in six months his recommendations for what the winningstate should pay.   The amendments were offered to the $3.1 billion EnergyDepartment research authorization bill.   As it stands, the bill would authorize $1.6 billion over thenext three years for the collider, of which $148 million would befor the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 _ but with no constructionfunds until Oct. 1, 1989.   Several amendments to the bill remain to be considered,including measures that would sharply reduce the super colliderauthorization or eliminate it altogether, and to make a 25 percentforeign contribution a requirement for proceeding with the giantatom smasher.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Counter-Terrorism Official Predicts Rise in Palestinian Terror</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A top U.S. counter-terrorism expert says thereis likely to be a surge in Palestinian terrorism as a result of theuprising in the Israeli-occupied territories and the killing of aPalestinian guerrilla chieftain.
