(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   All but two bands of ChippewaIndians called off their treaty-protected spearfishing outings aday after the state's general fishing season opened amid massprotests and hundreds of arrests.   ``We're not giving in to anything,'' Michael Allen, tribalchairman of the Lac du Flambeau band, said Sunday.   Calling off spearfishing was ``a gesture of good will thatneither the state officials nor the people of northern Wisconsindeserve _ but that we are freely offering them anyway,'' Allen said.   The spearfishing season, which coincides with the springspawning of walleye pikes, normally ends in the beginning of May.   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, who tried and failed last week to win afederal court order ending spearfishing Friday night, expressedrelief at the announcement.   ``I think people are tired, and it's been pushed as far as itcould be and as far as it should be,'' Thompson said. ``I'm gladit's over. It's been a very trying, emotional period of time.''   This is the fifth year the six Chippewa bands have spearedwalleyes and other game fish from northern Wisconsin lakes offreservations since a federal court ruling in 1983. That decisionheld that the tribe retained rights to hunt, fish, trap and gatherwild grain in 19th century treaties that ceded most of the northernthird of Wisconsin to the United States.   Chippewa spearfishing began April 23. More than 200 opponents ofthe Indians' treaty rights have been arrested, primarily at lakesused by the Lac du Flambeau band, when crowds crossed police linesset up at boat landings used by tribal fishermen.   This year's protests were larger than in previous years. Morethan 200 opponents of the Indians' treaty rights have been arrestedsince the season began.   Opposition grew after state and court rules allowed tribalfishermen to take up to 100 percent of what was considered a safecatch _ or the number that could be taken without hurting the fishpopulation _ from the 254 lakes the tribe targeted for spearing.The result is a reduction in the daily bag limit of walleyes forsport fishermen using many of the lakes.   The tribal catch wound up being much smaller than last yeardespite the concerns of spearfishing opponents.   The state Department of Natural Resources said the Chippewa asof Sunday had taken a total of only 15,725 walleyes, including8,326 taken by the Lac du Flambeau band.   By contrast, about 25,900 were caught last year, and the tribalfishing goal this year had been set at 43,801. The estimated catchby non-Indian anglers last year was 672,000 walleyes.   Allen said tribal officials would consult with spearers todecide if and when to resume spearing.</TEXT></DOC>
