Based on microhardness measurement techniques, the approachoutlined here gives good qualitative correlation with conventional metallographicapproaches for sub-surface damage assessment. Some data indicating variationof sub-surface damage with changing process parameters is presented;the aim of the paper, however, is to outline possible test methods andstimulate discussion. Possible approaches to measurement of tool sharpnessare also discussed, again with the aim of eliciting comments.</TEXT></DOC>
