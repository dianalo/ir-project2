We found that the firstCompton scattering of the gamma-ray energy degrading process can be correctlyreconstructed with a high probability if energies and positions of recoilelectrons are recorded with 4-10 keV (rms) and {approx_equal} 1x1x1 mm/sup3/ for the first 4-5 steps. If a silicon detector stack is used, we getan angular resolution of about 1/sup 0/ (rms) per gamma ray without collimators.We have started development work to make such a device using 2-dimensionalsilicon strip detectors.</TEXT></DOC>
