Role of this waste water on the contaminationof Ismailia Canal water and sediments was investigated extensively. Theuptake of metals by plants was studied for the first time. In addition,the metals Co, Cr, V, Mn and Fe were also studied for the first time.This study is covering 10 km up- and down-stream each rather than 5 km.A correlation between this study and a similar one carried out 9 yearsago was considered to understand the increasing role of this contamination.</TEXT></DOC>
