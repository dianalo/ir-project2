More than a million students, teachers and white-collar workerswill fan out across the vast country from Jan. 12-19 with aquestionnaire that for the first time will ask a series of questionsabout housing conditions.   But Mikhail S. Korolev, chairman of the State StatisticsCommittee, said no questions will be asked about religion, or aboutsalaries.   Previous surveys have determined that the population does notgive reliable answers about their income, he said. ``Some peoplehide their income. Some people increase it before other members ofthe family. Some people fantasize,'' he said.   Korolev pledged that all responses will be confidential, sealedby census workers after the information is fed into computer. Hesaid the results will be made public, but not as early as officialsoriginally thought.   ``There will be no disclosure of personal data to anyone,''Korolev told a news conference.   The census has been extended until Feb. 11 in Armenia because ofthe Dec. 7 earthquake, and that means initial figures won't beavailable in April as scientists originally thought, Korolev said.   Some Soviet publications contend that dictator Josef Stalinfalsified census data in the 1930s and destroyed a 1937 census tohide massive deaths caused by his collectivization of agricultureand purges.   Korolev said he knew of no cases of falsifying census data, butthat the results from the 1937 census were missing.   In 1934, Stalin announced a population figure of 168 million,even though the official figure was 165.7 million and one scientistput the actual figure as low as 158 million.   Soviet reference books put the population at the time of the 1917Bolshevik Revolution at 163 million, and Korolev said expertsestimate the population now is about 287 million.   The head of the statistics committee said questions about housingthat will appear for the first time include the age of housing inwhich respondents live, what the buildings are made of, whether thehousing is state-owned or cooperative, the number of rooms and thefloor area.   That list of questions, developed along United Nationsguidelines, will give officials an idea of what kinds of housing aremost durable as well as firm data about what kinds of housingSoviets are living in, he said.   Housing is one of the sore spots in efforts to improve livingconditions, and about one in five still lives in communal housing.Much of the housing, such as that which collapsed in the Armenianearthquake, is of poor construction.   The last full census 10 years ago showed a population of 262million. A pilot census was taken five years ago.</TEXT></DOC>
