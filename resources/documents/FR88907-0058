Section 816 provides, among other things, thatthe Secretary may utilize the services of responsible State and local agenciesin the enforcement of the Fair Housing laws, and ``may reimburse such agenciesand their employees for services rendered to assist him in carrying out''the Federal Fair Housing law.The Federal-State-local approach to eliminating housing discriminationis further enhanced by section 810(c) (42 U.S.C. 3610(c)). Section 810(c)provides for notification by the Secretary of complaints of housing discriminationto appropriate State and local fair housing agencies if their jurisdictions'fair housing laws provide ``rights and remedies for alleged discriminatoryhousing paractices which are substantially equivalent to the rights andremedies provided in'' the Federal Fair Housing law.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Existing FHAP</ITAG>HUD implemented sections 810(c) and 816 by promulgating regulations at24 CFR Parts 111 and 115. Part 111 provides, among other things, for twotypes of funding to State and local fair housing enforcement agencies_non-competitive(Type I) and competitive (Type II) funding. Type I funding supports fairhousing complaint processing, HUD-sponsored training, capacity buildingfor new agencies, and development of complaint monitoring and reportingsystems. Type II funds support specialized and innovative fair housingprojects.<ITAG tagnum="84">Need for Revision of Existing FHAP</ITAG>HUD data show that fewer than 25 agencies received Type II cooperativeagreements from the program's inception in FY 1980 through FY 1987. Thedata also indicate that there is a direct relationship between Type IIfunding and the level of complaint activity. Additionally, the data suggestthat it is the outreach, education, audits, and other specialized activitiessupposed by Type II funds that are the critical factors accounting forqualitative differences in enforcement programs. Increased funding to Stateand local agencies for support activities has had a salutary effect ontheir fair housing enforcement efforts. The fact is, however, that thecurrent funding approach does not provide support to a sufficient numberof jurisdictions, in spite of evidence that suggests housing discriminationis widespread in jurisdictions that were unsuccessful in the competitionfor Type II funds. Consequently, the comprehensive funding approach proposedin this rule would increase the number of agencies receiving funds forspecialized activities, thus strengthening fair housing compliance andenforcement efforts nationally.In addition, the matching funds provision which would be part of this newapproach should strengthen a coordinated intergovernmental enforcementeffort to further the goal of fair housing by giving States and localitiesthe impetus to assume a larger share of the responsibility for the administrationof fair housing laws. The revised program also would contribute to a morevisible fair housing presence in many jurisdictions by increasing the abilityand flexibility of recipients to plan a long-term fair housing programwhich fits their needs. As an additional incidental benefit, the new FHAPwill improve internal HUD program administration both in HUD Headquartersand the Regional Offices by reducing the number of negotiated cooperativeagreement awards. Finally, the Department was persuaded of the need topropose these changes from its continuing discussions and consultationwith a number of agencies participating in the FHAP.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Revised FHAP</ITAG>Under the new funding formula, substantially equivalent jurisdictions wouldcontinue to be eligible for funds to support case processing and trainingof enforcement agency staff. Further, those agencies that have participatedin FHAP for more than two years (``contributions agencies'') may be eligibleto receive, on a noncompetitive basis, additional funds to enhance theirfair housing program. Contributions agencies that process a threshold levelof complaints and meet certain other performance requirements also wouldreceive incentive funds for specialized fair housing support activities.The amount of incentive funds received would be based on a jurisdiction'spopulation and on cash contributions generated from non-Federal sourcesits fair housing program.The proposed revised approach would continue to link directly a significantportion of FHAP agency assistance to the number of complaints processedby an agency. Funding to support complaint processing would continue tobe based on the number of dual-filed housing discrimination complaintsprocessed. (Because of the revision to the FHAP, for the first year ofHUD's implementation of the revised Program, the level of complaints wouldbe determined by reference to the number of dual-filed complaints processedin any 12 consecutive months (as selected by the agency) during an 18-monthperiod designated by HUD.) Funds previously used for Type II competitiveawards would support other activities among those eligible FHAP agenciesthat meet a minimum complaint-processing threshold. Thus, agencies wouldhave an incentive to conduct complaint-processing in a thorough, comprehensive,and timely manner.Depending on the availability of funds, some of these incentive funds wouldbe distributed on the basis of need, as measured by the size of the jurisdiction'spopulation (for example, agencies serving jurisdictions with populationsof fewer than 250,000 people may receive up to $10,000, whereas those agenciesserving jurisdictions with more than 3,000,000 people may receive up to$25,000), and some additional funding on the basis of the agency's Stateor local cash (non-Federal) contributions to its fair housing program.This latter feature would discourage sole reliance on FHAP to support aState or local fair housing program, and would encourage States and localitiesto shoulder a share of the financial responsibility for their program.The proposed new funding approach will enable HUD to review the agenciesand their overall performance in implementing their plan for combatinghousing discrimination. Each agency also would be evaluated with respectto its continuing status as a substantially equivalent agency. Satisfactionof the performance criteria for equivalency recognition as set forth in24 CFR Part 115 would be required for funding, except for those agenciesthat have been recognized by HUD on an ``interim'' basis. (See 24 CFR 115.11.)In the proposed revisions to the FHAP, existing sections would be revisedand new sections would be added. New andSection; 111.101 would define termsused in this rule. Section 111.103 would give an overview of the purposeof the program. Section 111.105 describes the proposed revision to thefunding formula. Section 111.107 would revise the provisions on ``Agencythreshold eligibility criteria.'' Section 111.109 is a proposed revisionof the old provisions (formerly andSection; 111.108) on ``Program administration.''Section 111.111, ``Applications for participation in the program'', describes,among other things, the contents of an application for funding, and statesthat an adverse determination by a Regional Office would be appealableto the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. Section111.113 sets out the additional criteria that recipients would have tosatisfy to be awarded incentive funds. Section 111.115 describes the proposedactivities that are eligible for funding under the incentive component.Section 111.117 proposes that HUD conduct a review of a recipient's performanceannually, and describes the substance of the review process. Section 111.119states the reason that HUD would reallocate funds, and andSection; 111.121describes the reporting and recordkeeping requirements with which all recipientsof FHAP funds would have to comply. Section 111.123 details the remedialaction that HUD would take against a recipient that fails to meet the performancereview standards of FHAP, as set forth in andSection; 111.117.The Department hopes to adopt a final rule in this proceeding in time toimplement the revised funding formula for FY 1989 FHAP awards. The Departmentbelieves that this formula will result in a more equitable and predictableaward of FHAP funds than was obtained under the current Type II formulathat awards funds based on a competition among eligible agencies. The Department'sbelief is shared by many of the State and local agencies with which theDepartment has consulted over the last 3 years before proposing these revisionsto the FHAP. This new formula will ensure that more agencies receive fundingon a more consistent basis, thus allowing them to plan their fair housingactivities annually without large fluctuations in funding amounts. Thenew formula also should enable these agencies to structure their fair housingprogram to include a broader range of activities, such as education, outreach,testing, systemic investigations, or other eligible activities that preventor eliminate housing discrimination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters  </ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. TheFinding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection duringregular business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Officeof the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room10276, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410.  This rule would not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulations issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates thatit would not (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.  In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), theundersigned hereby certifies that this rule would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule wouldprovide for the award of Federal funds to State and local government fairhousing agencies; it does not impose any economic burdens on small entities. The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).

A portion of these funds will be based on fixed amounts determinedin accordance with the size of the population of the jurisdiction servedby the agency. (HUD will use the most recent census data to determine ajurisdiction's population). In addition, a second portion of incentivefunds will be determined by HUD's matching of the cash contributions generatedfrom non-Federal sources for the agency's fair housing programs. Data submittedpertaining to the amount of the agency's non-Federal contribution mustbe certified as true by the agency's head or by his or her designee; thedata must be based on the agency's records from the previous fiscal year.HUD will provide a formula to be used to distribute matching incentivefunds in an annual Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>.
