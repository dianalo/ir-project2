It is tentatively called ``Moveable Feast.''   _ The show, heading for a PBS date in February, is written,reported and anchored by Lloyd Dobyns, her partner from twosardonic, acclaimed NBC News series of yesteryear, ``Weekend'' and``NBC News Overnight.''   _ She isn't involved in ``Moveable Feast,'' she says, ``otherthan to annoy Lloyd from time to time.''   ``I recused myself,'' she explains, savoring the word recused,``because of my General Foods connection, although there's nothingin the documentary having to do with General Foods.'' Theconnection is the Maxwell House coffee commercials she taped lastspring, a deed for which critics roasted her.   _ She has not, as was implied in a recent published report, beenapproached by NBC News to be a temporary co-anchor at ``SundayToday'' when co-anchor Maria Shriver takes a six-week maternityleave starting Nov. 15.   NBC, which she left in 1985, hasn't asked her, Ellerbee says.``It's all news to me,'' she says of the report, adding that nonetwork has talked to her about a job, including ABC, which sheleft in 1987 after her ``Our World'' was axed.   Ellerbee also is back doing her CNN commentaries after a summerin which she lost, she reckons, 26 pounds through a strict regimen.She disclosed all this in an interview.   Queries included whether she will do more of those still-runningMaxwell House commercials. ``I don't know,'' she replied to thatone.   To those who say she sold her journalistic credibility for amess of instant-coffee money, she would say, and did, that ``peoplecan think what they want. I had good reasons to do it, and if thecircumstances were the same, I'd do it again.''   She and Rolfe Tessem, her production partner, explained thatstarting her company required a healthy infusion of cash. TheMaxwell House money _ they declined to say how much it was _ seemedthe best way to do this and retain control they might have lostwith other means of financing, they say.   Being the host of a syndicated talk show might have provided themoney, she says, but, ``I did not want to do a talk show. I feelthey cloud the line between news and entertainment far more than acommercial does. There's no clouding with a commercial.''   Having gotten Lucky Duck's first show on the road, so to speak,she and Tessem say they have other journalistic projects in thediscussion stages on three fronts _ cable, syndication and publictelevision.   They decline to elaborate on these efforts, citing thepossibility of concept-poaching by others. But she doesn't rule outworking on-air again with Doybns, who left NBC, now lives nearRaleigh, N.C., and still is her pal.   ``It's possible,'' she says. ``I do get along with the man, andthere are few enough who do.''   Ellerbee, as some may have noticed, is a woman of many opinions,all strong. When asked for a thought on the state of televisionnowadays, she immediately gave this one:   ``The more I see the re-creations of the news and read about thestagings of the news, the more clean I feel about that commercial.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   BACK TO THE PAST _ CBS News' Bob Simon and his crew recentlywere in the Laotian capital of Vientiane, a hub of secret andnot-so-secret activity during the Vietnam War but rarely visitednow by network crews. Simon, a source says, taped reports thatinclude one about sad, deadly leftovers of the Vietnam War _unexploded anti-personnel bombs called cluster-bomb units.Missionaries he interviewed, the source says, say the bomblets nowoccasionally maim or kill Laotian peasants on Laos' Plain of Jars,an old battlefield.   FORMER FIRST LADY TALKS _ ``Good Morning America'' co-anchorCharles Gibson is in Los Angeles today and Tuesday, interviewingNancy Reagan about her new book of memoirs, ``My Turn,'' andreports of such matters as astrology and what influence she had onPresident Reagan's administration. The interview will air in fiveparts on the ABC show the week of Oct. 31-Nov. 3.   BUT FIRST, THIS IS TODAY _ Bryant Gumbel, co-anchor of NBC'sfuss festival, ``Today,'' won't be on the show today, a spokeswomansays. But there is no significance to this. He is just taking theday off, she says. Jane Pauley, who took a day off last week, willco-anchor today's ``Today'' with Gumbel's fill-in, DeborahNorville, the show's new news anchor.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday PMs, Oct. 9</NOTE></DOC>
