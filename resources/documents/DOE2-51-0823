The results of calculations performed forthe VG-400 core and GROG critical assembly bench used for experimentalstudy of the VG-400 reactor physics are given. The data obtained havedemonstrated satisfactory coincidence of the measured and calculatedresults. They also permit to estimate the possibilities of VG-400 reactorscale modelling at the GROG bench. 7 refs.; 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
