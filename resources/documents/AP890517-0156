Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said thedeportations do not signal a change in policy and were delayedbecause ``there were some bottlenecks.''   Although dozens of Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans havebeen deported since the Immigration and Naturalization Servicebegan detaining Central American asylum-seekers on Feb. 20, noNicaraguans had been deported until Monday.   INS spokesman Duke Austin said 10 Nicaraguans were deportedMonday and 16 on Tuesday, with deportation orders pending on morethan 100 others.   In July 1987, then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III issued amemorandum encouraging the INS to look favorably on asylum casesfiled by Nicaraguans. That memo required the Justice Department'sasylum policy review unit to examine all requests for refugeestatus from Nicaraguans, Austin said.   The INS recently received approval from the Justice Departmentto remove some Nicaraguans, Austin said. Ms. Burstion-Wade saidDeputy Attorney General Harold Christensen has final word onNicaraguan deportations.   In the six months after the Meese memo, the Nicaraguan asylumapproval rate rose to 83 percent, compared with 30 percent beforethe directive, according to INS figures released by Rep. JohnBryant, D-Texas.   On Wednesday, religious leaders who toured the Rio Grande Valleyearlier this week condemned the INS' practice of detaining refugeesand disputed agency claims that the flow reaching Texas has droppedunder its get-tough approach.   ``Despite the expenditure of a large sum of money (millions ofdollars) by the Immigration and Naturalization Service during thepast 60 days, we saw no convincing evidence that the policy ofincreased enforcement, detention and rapid deportation has resultedin any significant decrease in the flow of Central Americanrefugees across the border,'' the group's statement said.   The group from the Interfaith Committee for Central AmericanRefugee Protection said the INS policy has succeded only inremoving the refugees and the problem from public view, whilecreating ``serious obstacles to the filing of legitimate claims.''   Austin said the group cannot back up claims the flow of alienshas not fallen, adding: ``We can support with empirical data thatthe flow has dramatically decreased,'' Austin said.   Austin said the number of refugees filing for asylum has fallento about 70 or 80 a week, down from about 1,700 to 2,400 a weekearlier this year.</TEXT></DOC>
