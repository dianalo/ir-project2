Lynn Martin (R., Ill.) attackedher opponent, incumbent Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.), for aphone call he made to a savings and loan association onbehalf of a Simon supporter and Chicago real estate agent whodefaulted on a $5 million loan. &quot;You'd think a U.S. senatorwould have shown better judgment,&quot; said a Martin commercial.   Next came the counterattack. The Simon campaign aired a TVspot asserting that then-Rep. Simon was one of 13 members ofCongress to vote against the first major deregulation bill.&quot;Lynn Martin consistently favored deregulation of Sandamp;Ls,&quot;charged the Simon ad.</LP><TEXT>   The difference in these two approaches to the Sandamp;L issueclearly reflects the particular circumstances of eachcandidate. But it also underscores a larger point: As the twoparties begin to refine their messages on the thrift debacle,they are starting to present two sharply different picturesof the crisis.   For Democrats, the Sandamp;L collapse is a national issue thatdiscredits 10 years of Republican-inspired economicderegulation. &quot;George Bush, Ronald Reagan and theirhigh-roller friends ran the government, designed the Sandamp;Lpolicy, and hand-picked the people that gutted the oversightagencies,&quot; charges the Democratic National Committee's &quot;Guidefor Understanding the Sandamp;L Crisis,&quot; sent out last month toDemocratic members of Congress.   Republicans, however, define the issue less sweepingly asthe result of the corruption or ineptitude of individualpoliticians, many of them Democratic. A recent paper by theHouse Republican Conference concedes that the Reaganadministration erred in hiring too few bank examiners and notpaying them enough, but stresses that the chief villains werekey lawmakers who &quot;stall, strut, posture, hold their nose,clip wires on the smoke-detectors, and throw rocks at thefiremen.&quot;   Such opposing views reflect the two parties' differentstrategies in dealing with the thrift crisis, which isexpected to cost the federal government $130 billion,excluding interest. Democrats, who must wait until 1992before they can use the Sandamp;L issue against President Bush,have substituted his son Neil as a symbol of the thrift mess.Although the furor over Neil Bush's role as a director of theSilverado Banking, Savings andamp; Loan Association has subsided,conflict-of-interest charges concerning Mr. Bush will get afresh airing at an administrative hearing in Denver laterthis month.   Republicans, meanwhile, are vigorously publicizingconnections between the Sandamp;L industry and individual membersof Congress like Rep. Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.), whose twosons-in-law were recently revealed to have former ties to theU.S. League of Savings Institutions.   Nowhere is the difference between the two parties' stancesmore apparent than in the DNC and House Republican Conferencepapers issued last month. The Democratic document chargesthat the thrift mess &quot;was created by deliberate cutbacks inthe supervision of the Sandamp;L industry under Republican economicphilosophy, in a Republican era, under two successiveRepublican administrations.&quot; The Republican report, on theother hand, states that the Sandamp;L crisis was created in theearly 1980s by &quot;a bipartisan cast of politicians,&quot; and arguesthat the involvement of Democrats in creating the problemmakes &quot;Democratic willingness to make Sandamp;L salvage managementan issue in 1990&quot; seem &quot;strange.&quot;   Thus far, the differences in party strategies haven't hada major impact on the campaign trail. Where the opportunitypresents itself, Democrats seem just as eager as Republicansto attack their opponents' individual records on Sandamp;Ls --especially when the opponent has accepted contributions fromthe thrift industry.   Even where the differences do surface, drawing a partisanline can be difficult for Democrats. For example, Sen.Simon's TV ad doesn't explicitly label deregulation as aRepublican policy, and for good reason: That first vote hecast against deregulation occurred in 1980, when Jimmy Carterwas president.   Still, congressional Democrats are working to keepRepublican culpability in the headlines through a number ofhearings on the Sandamp;L crisis scheduled for this month. Sen.Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) on Tuesday concluded a series ofhearings on James Fail, a Texas thrift executive who retaineda former Bush aide to lobby on his behalf. And Sen. DavidPryor (D., Ark.) is planning to investigate theadministration of the Sandamp;L bailout itself -- which isunambiguously the responsibility of the Bush administration.   Now there are signs that Democratic challengers arebeginning to heed the message spelled out in the DNC playbook-- if not to attack Republicans, at least to attackWashington. &quot;The Sandamp;L scandal is costing us billions and thebudget deficit is skyrocketing and all politicians inWashington can think of is to make us pay for the mess,&quot;charges an ad for Democrat Harry Lonsdale, who's challengingSen. Mark Hatfield (R., Ore.).   Another ad, for challenger Ted Muenster, a Democratseeking to unseat Sen. Larry Pressler (R., S.D.), states that&quot;the politicians are spending more time blaming each otherfor the savings and loan mess than trying to get our moneyback.&quot;   Still, both parties have far to go in articulating theirmessages. &quot;For Democrats, it ought to be a policy debate overderegulation,&quot; says political scientist William Schneider ofthe American Enterprise Institute. &quot;The Republicanargument,&quot;he says, &quot;is essentially that it's a congressionalfailure.&quot; But so far, &quot;it's the politics of characterassassination. It's just another device for negativecampaigning.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
