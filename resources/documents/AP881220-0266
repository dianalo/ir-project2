Seasonally adjusted consumer prices rose just 0.25 percent inNovember compared with a 0.4 percent increase in October, the LaborDepartment said. Before the seasonal adjustments, prices rose only0.1 percent.   The monthly inflation figure was rounded off in the department'sannouncement to 0.3 percent although the actual figure was 0.25percent.   Clothing prices that had jumped 4 percent in September andOctober with the introduction of fall and winter fashions dipped 0.3percent last month. And food prices showed no increase in Novemberfor the first time since February.   Analysts who had been seeing harbingers of inflation everywherein recent economic data described as ``amazing'' and ``remarkable''the continued lack of it in the government's monthly report on theConsumer Price Index.   The new figures slowed the annual inflation rate from 4.6 percentfor the first 10 months of the year to 4.4 percent for the first 11months, the same as it was for all of 1987.   With only December left, another month similar to November couldenable the Reagan administration to finish its last year in officemeeting its inflation target of 4.3 percent for 1988.   ``It's amazing,'' said David Wyss, chief economist for DataResources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., consulting firm. ``We've gonesix years into an expansion and have the lowest unemployment in 14years and there's no sign of inflation, at least at the consumerlevel.''   Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. inChicago, said inflation grew by about one-half percentage point inlate 1987 but ``has hung there ever since.''   ``It's rather remarkable when you consider that capacityutilization in factories is up and the labor market has gottentighter,'' he said. ``But there it is: inflation is stalled out.''   Meanwhile Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that thenon-farm economy grew at an annual rate of only 3 percent in thethird quarter compared with what was generally acknowledged as anoverheated rate of 3.9 percent last spring.   The effects of the drought, however, limited overall GNP growthto 2.5 percent, in line with the Federal Reserve Board'snon-inflationary growth target of 2 percent to 2.5 percent.   Preliminary reports had put the annual non-farm growth rate at3.2 percent and total GNP growth at 2.6 percent in the thirdquarter. Economists said the downward revisions were due primarilyto larger declines in government spending and the drought havingless overall impact than previously believed.   Corporate profits before taxes rose 2.6 percent in theJuly-September quarter to $313.9 billion, following 6.9 percent jumpin the second quarter. After taxes, corporations reported theirprofits rising 3.9 percent in the third quarter compared with 8.9percent last spring.   ``With productivity growth slowing, the big profit increases inthe economy are over,'' said Larry Chimerine, president of the WEFAGroup, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm. ``Higher unit laborcosts are squeezing profit margins.''   But those higher labor costs are not finding their way intoworkers' wallets. Average weekly earnings of $327.92 last month,after adjusting for November's inflation, dropped 0.8 percent, theLabor Department said Tuesday.   In terms of buying power, workers are making 1 percent less thanthey did a year ago, the department said.   The November increases raised the Consumer Price Index to 120.3,meaning that a marketbasket of goods costing $100 in a 1982-84 baseperiod would have cost $120.30 last month, a dime more than inOctober and $4.40 more than in November 1987.   Housing and shelter costs, including residential rents, rose 0.3percent in November, the same pace they have maintained over thepast nine months.   Natural gas and electric rates were up 1.8 percent and 0.1percent, respectively, from October, more than offsetting a 2percent drop in prices for home heating oil, the government said.The November decrease was the sixth in a row for heating oil, nowpriced 10.8 percent below where it was last spring.   Seasonally adjusted gasoline prices were unchanged from October,remaining 0.2 percent less than they were at the end of last yearand 28.1 percent below their peak level of March 1981.   Consumer prices for items other than food, shelter and energyrose an average 0.2 percent in November after jumping 0.7 percent inOctober.   New-car prices, which has risen more than one percentage point inSpetember and October, declined by 0.2 percent last month in reflectthe introduction of rebates on some of the new 1989 models.   However, auto financing and insurance costs continued to advancedramatically, with the former up 1.5 percent and the latter 0.9percent above October. Airline fares also jumped by 1.1 percent.   Medical costs, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent last month and are upat an annual rate of 7 percent so far this year.</TEXT></DOC>
