The grain dispute, in which Australia claims that U.S. subsidiesto domestic growers are harmful to its markets, has settled into aholding pattern. Both sides agree it should be decided at thecurrent round of trade liberalization talks now under way in Geneva,said Acting Assistant Secretary of State William Clark.   Clark told reporters after the president and Hawke met that thetwo nations are in agreement that grain subsidies should be doneaway with, but the Bush administration is unwilling to take suchsteps until an agreement involving other countries is reached at theinternational forum.   In an arrival ceremony on the White House's South Lawn, Bush saidAustralians and Americans share a ``pioneer heritage in the tamingof two vast continents, a heritage of democratic ideas and aheritage of common sacrifice in war and common efforts in peace.''   The two leaders discussed among other issues the currentrepression in China, which the United States and Australia both havecondemned.   Hawke later gave the president a strong vote of confidence duringa photo session in the Oval Office, saying that his views are``identical'' to those of Bush in deploring and condemning ``thebarbarism'' of Beijing in violently suppressing the demonstrationsfor democracy.   However, he said, Australia shares the administration's concernthat it not take actions that would reverse China's economic reforms.   While Bush did not publicly mention the agriculture dispute,Hawke was outspoken in stating that he would bring up the matter.   Australia dislikes the United States' Export Enhancement Program,which provides subsidies to U.S. grain growers.   Clark said the United States contends its subsidy program isoperated ``in a manner that doesn't harm traditional suppliers.''   The Australians say the subsidy program has cut into theirexports to other markets and gives the U.S. growers an unfair priceadvantage. The United States maintains the program is aimed atcountering only Europe's protectionist policies.   The subject was a matter of some controversy during VicePresident Dan Quayle's recent visit to Australia.   During the arrival ceremonies, Hawke addressed the matter saying,``Mr. President, it is precisely because of the depth and thematurity of our relationship that the difference of views that doexist between us can be faced openly and honestly, for example, onsome trade matters particularly aspects of agricultural policy.''   ``I am quite confident that today we will be able to focus onways to minimize, if not entirely resolve such differences.''   Hawke said in a speech Monday in Washington that although damageto Australia from the U.S. policy ``has lessened over the past yearor so, owing to lower world grain harvests and a running down ofstocks, there remains a danger that competitive expoertsubsidisation will agian damage Australia when grain surplusesre-emerge.''   In addition, Bush said the two leaders would discuss sharesstrategic interests and Hawke's strong support for banning chemicalweapons, a position Bush strongly advocated during his presidentialcampaign.   ``You may be assured of our commitment to the early achievementof an effectively verifiable treaty banning these weapons,'' Bushsaid.   He also hailed Australia's ``bold leadership in foreign policy,both close to home and far from your shores. From the South Pacificto Africa, Australia is a force for economic growth and a beacon ofdemocracy,'' Bush said.</TEXT></DOC>
