Earlier today, about a dozen radical students hurled rocks atthe headquarters of the giant Hyundai group in Seoul to protest thekidnapping at the Hyundai subsidiary. No injuries were reported.   Labor unrest continued at three other Hyundai subsidiaries insouthern Korea. The Hyundai group is one of the largestconglomerates in South Korea.   On Wednesday, management locked out 20,000 striking workers atHyundai Motor Co. in Ulsan and said there was little chance ofsettling a strike for higher wages. The strike began Monday.   At Hyundai Precision and Industry Co., which makes trains,management and workers held two rounds of talks today but failed toend a one-week strike at the company's plants in Ulsan andChangwon. The talks were held one day after strikers freed one ofthe 11 executives they took hostage on Friday.   ``Punish the masterminds of the kidnapping,'' the studentsshouted as tey hurled rocks at the Hyundai group's main building inSeoul, breaking four windows. The students ran away before policearrived.   Hours after the attack, government prosecutors arrested twoHyundai Engineering officials, executive board member ChoiJae-dong, 47, and manager for general affairs Kang Myung-ku, 42,and charged them with hiring several men to kidnap labor organizerSuh Jung-ui, 34.   The government prosecutors said they would expand theinvestigation to find out whether other Hyundai officials wereinvolved in the kidnapping.   Suh was kidnapped May 10 by a group of unidentified men as heleft a Seoul restaurant where he had met with some officials of thehuge construction company, which is based in Seoul.   Suh, who worked at the company's Seoul headquarters, returnedhome several days later and said he was released after he agreed towrite a letter of resignation addressed to the company.   Hyundai Engineering denied involvement at the time.   Details of the kidnapping emerged this week when some of thealleged kidnappers surrendered to police or were arrested in Seouland other cities.   Their leader told police Hyundai Engineering executives offeredhim $27,000 to kidnap Suh and persuade him to drop his labororganizing effort.</TEXT></DOC>
