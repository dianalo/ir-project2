Observer Membership For PLO</HEAD><BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Arab League said Friday it will campaign tomake the Palestine Liberation Organization an observer-member of theUnited Nations, putting the organization on a level with Switzerlandand the Vatican.   ``We are now going to try and get a resolution that would makethe Palestinian state an observer-member of the United Nations,''Clovis Maksoud, the league's U.S. and U.N. representative, said at anews conference.   The session was called primarily to discuss next week's specialU.N. General Assembly meeting in Geneva at which PLO Chairman YasserArafat will speak. Arafat was denied a U.S. visa on grounds he hasbeen involved in terrorism.   The league, formed in 1945, comprises 21 Arab states and``Palestine,'' which it says is represented by the PLO.   The PLO is currently one of two groups with permanent observermissions to the United Nations, the other being the South-WestAfrica People's Organization. The current status recognizes theirclaim to represent peoples.   The new designation would rank the PLO among ``non-memberstates,'' elevating the status of the Palestinian people inIsraeli-occupied territory.   Maksoud said there would be no point in trying to make the PLO afull member, because it could not win approval by the United Statesin the Security Council. But, he added, ``Maybe this can be atransition to full membership at a later date.''   The non-member states are Monaco, North and South Korea, SanMarino, Switzerland and the Vatican.   Discussing the Israeli raid Friday at Naameh, 50 miles insideLebanon, Maksoud called it a ``pre-emptive strike against the peaceoption'' and timed to coincide with the first anniversary of thestart of uprisings in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   ``This is a signal of further oppression yet to come,'' Maksoudsaid. ``This is unprovoked violence by Israel. There has been noprovocation. It is an attempt to destabilize Lebanon and to continueits illegal occupation of the south of Lebanon.''   Maksoud criticized President Reagan's comment at his newsconference Thursday night that Arafat's statement Wednesday sayingthe PLO accepts Israel and rejects terrorism ``in all its forms''was ambiguous.   ``We consider that Mr. Arafat's statements have been clear,unequivocal and categorical,'' he said. ``There isn't anyambiguity.''   Maksoud said that ``to include the uprising within the context ofterrorism, as the reaction of the United States seems to include, ismind-boggling and unacceptable.''</TEXT></DOC>
