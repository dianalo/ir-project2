The anti-military service group called ``Action for TotalRefusal'' was protesting federal efforts to force a convicted draftdodger to serve jail time in West Germany.   Federal officials are trying to extradite Gerhard Scherer fromWest Berlin to begin serving a five-month sentence for refusingboth mandatory military service and the alternative CivilianService option for those opposed to violence.   About 10 demonstrators, protesting illegally on the Parliamentgrounds, startled Momper's security detachment when they unfurled abanner that had been hidden in a bouquet of flowers the protesterstried to press on Momper.   One of the protesters wore a rubber mask of Chancellor HelmutKohl on the back of his head and had his coat on backwards as well,creating the impression he had his back to Momper when he leapedforward to unfurl the banner.   Security men quickled wrestled the masked protester to theground, and others engaged in brief battles with demonstrators toseparate them from Momper's party.   Momper, a member of the left-wing Social Democratic Party, hadbeen asked by the anti-military service group to reject theextradition request. He was at the federal Parliament building onFriday to be inaugurated as president of the Bundesrat, the upperhouse of Parliament.   Demonstrations are forbidden on the West German Parliamentgrounds, but no arrests were made following the incident Friday.   West German residents of West Berlin are not subject to thecompulsory service law because of the city's status under Alliedcontrol.   But Scherer was a resident of Baden-Wuerttemberg state when hereached the military service age. He is in hiding in West Berlin,where authorities have been asked to find him and return him toBaden-Wuerttemberg to serve his term.</TEXT></DOC>
