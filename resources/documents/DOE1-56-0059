The objectiveof this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating a stablemonolithic bipolar electrode assembly through the proper choice of materials.Limited research, prior to this program, led to the development of abipolar electrode assembly comprising a cermet-based inert anode whichis brazed to a TiB{sub 2} cathode element through the use of an intermediatelayer. The major task of this research was to identify and incorporatediffusion barriers to limit the diffusion of the end member constituents.Annealing studies were to be carried out to determine the long-term stabilityand functionality of the electrode as limited diffusion occurs.</TEXT></DOC>
