Companies must validate all new hires' citizenship documents, starting June 1. Job aspirants and companies are unprepared; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says it is &quot;swamped&quot; with anxious employer calls. An official of Florida Citrus Mutual, a Lakeland cooperative, says that carrying out the law &quot;overwhelms&quot; members. Taco Viva Inc., a Pompano Beach, Fla., restaurant chain, may need another employee to handle the added paperwork.    Good workers affected by the law are leaving El Chico Corp., the Dallas Mexican-food chain complains. David Block, a Texas landscaper, expects to pay $2-a-day more for workers as the labor pool shrinks. Texas cattlemen have long relied on illegal aliens, an association official notes. Without them, some older ranchers may just retire.    One uncertainty, says American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.: how job seekers and the government will use a law provision banning hiring discrimination.    THE POLYGRAPH MAN harassed women; the employer shares the blame.    So says a New York state appeals court in a case involving a polygraph operator retained by Mesmer Dairy Stores Inc., Buffalo, to give lie-detector tests to employees and job applicants. The state attorney general filed sexual harassment charges against the man, citing 11 women's complaints. They alleged he asked improper sexually oriented questions and physically harassed them, touching some women's breasts while testing them.    The food chain argued it wasn't responsible for any harassment. But the court ruled it was liable, calling the tester a Mesmer &quot;employee.&quot; Besides, the court said, the company continued to have the man screen workers and job seekers even &quot;after it had notice of his improper conduct.&quot;    RETRAINING AID spreads to white-collar workers in the oil patch.    Labor Department grants will be used more to teach new skills or to relocate geologists, petroleum engineers and other professionals in Oklahoma and Texas. Oklahoma labor officials say oil and gas geologists can be retrained in two months to fill a need for hydrologists; engineers could soon become science teachers. Texas workers learn new computer skills in federally funded courses and then are sent to cities with high-tech jobs.    Retraining needs grow as the demand for new wells runs dry, idling 30% of geologists. &quot;We're finding a new level of dislocated worker,&quot; says Gary Dick, a Texas community-affairs department official. When an oilman spoke to a Lafayette, La., geologists' luncheon meeting recently, everyone else at the head table was out of work.    Oil-patch joke: How many geologists can a pickup truck hold? Answer: Two, plus their lawn mowers.    EMPLOYEE ATTITUDES are souring, a survey of corporate managers by Uniforce Temporary Services, Hyde Park, N.Y., shows. Of 594 respondents, 65% said worker views have worsened in five years. Managers see less interest in extra hours, job dedication, attendance and punctuality.    MORE FARMERS qualify for unemployment compensation when hit by floods or other disasters, Labor Secretary Brock rules, aiding farmers in nine Midwest states. Brock changes a federal policy that withheld all jobless pay if a farmer's crops were wiped out, but he still had some livestock.    A LA CARTE: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, tongue in cheek, offers labor's legislative &quot;menu.&quot; The list includes a mandated health-care &quot;entree&quot; for $21.4 billion (the business cost) and a $900 million Davis-Bacon federal-contract wage increase for &quot;dessert.&quot;    SMALL MINES have the worst safety records and under-report deaths and injuries, a report by Congress's General Accounting Office says. Operators may fear reports will lead to higher worker-compensation costs and more federal scrutiny, the study adds. Unions and some mine groups urge stiffer fines for such violations.    PERSONNEL PINCH forces many retailers to sweeten worker benefits.    Marshall's Inc., a Wakefield, Mass., discounter, offers college tuition money and paid-time van-pool commuting to part-time help at 60 stores. &quot;We have a lot of employees who wouldn't be with us&quot; otherwise, says Kathleen Giles, benefits director. Best Products Co. and Philadelphia's John Wanamaker department store give part-timers medical and other benefits.    Youthful disdain for jobs in affluent areas worsens the labor shortage. &quot;The help situation is atrocious for all retailers,&quot; says William Pearson, general manager of a Philadelphia-area sporting-goods company. To help keep workers, he counsels those with personal problems. Two California Wicks 'N' Sticks stores give part-timers bonuses and Hawaii trips when sales surge.    But in New Orleans, where unemployment is high, Wiener Enterprises Inc. job seekers &quot;take what they can get,&quot; an official says.    THE CHECKOFF: A retired Pacific Bell engineer protests his disability-pay loss by firing 100 shotgun and pistol shots into the company's Riverside, Calif., switching gear, disabling phone service. . . . The Agriculture Department subsidizes tobacco but also joins with insurers to promote work-site &quot;wellness&quot; in ways such as giving up smoking. . . . Teamster leaders send women at union headquarters -- even department heads -- a carnation for Secretaries Week. </TEXT></DOC>
