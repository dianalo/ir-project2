The REL for radon progenyapplies only to the workplace and is not designed to protect the populationat large. The REL is intended to (1) protect miners from the developmentof lung cancer, (2) be measurable by techniques that are valid, reproducible,and available to industry and government agencies, and (3) be technicallyachievable.</TEXT></DOC>
