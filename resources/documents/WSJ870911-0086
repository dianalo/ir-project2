The Environmental Protection Agency draft report, based on a two-year study for Congress, also pinpoints pulp and paper mills as &quot;a previously unsuspected possible source&quot; of dioxin discharges. EPA officials said they are moving toward regulating the mill emissions. Other dioxin contamination is blamed on many small sources ranging from waste dumps and incinerators to now-banned pesticides.    The study found detectable levels of dioxin -- one part per trillion or more -- in 28% of fish taken in 394 river and lake sites across the nation, including 23 of 29 sites in the Great Lakes. About half of the tainted fish had detectable dioxin in their fillets, which people might eat. Warnings against fish consumption have been issued for a few of the sites the agency studied.    Dioxin is considered one of the most potent of carcinogens, but the risk posed by exposure to low levels of the substance is widely debated    The EPA has concluded that the levels it found &quot;may be acause for concern&quot; in some areas, depending on local levelsof contamination and patterns of fish consumption. A lifetimeof frequent consumption of fish tainted with only one partper trillion of dioxin would cause as much as one canceramong 100,000 people, the EPA says. That level usually ishigh enough to cause the agency to act -- by regulatingdischarges, for instance.   But regulation of fish consumption is a state responsibility. And the Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for advising states about such matters, has said concentrations of dioxin below 25 parts per trillion pose &quot;no serious health concerns.&quot;    The FDA has warned against eating any fish with more than 50 parts per trillion, or more than two fish a month with 25 parts per trillion. It says almost none of the sites the EPA identified pose serious health concerns.    Ellen Silbergeld, a toxics specialist for the Environmental Defense Fund, a research and lobbying group, claims that warnings should be issued anywhere that dioxin in whole fish exceeds one part per trillion, and that fish consumption should be banned where dioxin reaches 10 parts per trillion.    Based on the EPA study, that would require notices along many major U.S. rivers, including parts of the Mississippi, Ohio, Hudson, Alabama, James, Tennessee, Savannah, Flint, Willamette, Potomac and Penobscot rivers.    The good news from the EPA's dioxin survey was that fish and shellfish in coastal waters and estuaries rarely were contaminated and, when they were, the contamination was at low levels.    Paper mills drew the EPA's attention when the two highest fish-contamination levels in the national dioxin contamination survey were found downstream from paper mills. A fish with 85 parts per trillion of dioxin was found in the Rainy River, which runs between Minnesota and Ontario. A fish in Maine's Androscoggin River recorded 29 parts per trillion of dioxin. Both states have issued warnings about consuming fish from the rivers.    The survey was completed more than a year ago. Subsequent research appears to confirm that mills have been producing small quantities of unwanted dioxin, said Alec McBride, chief of the EPA's water quality analysis branch.    Mr. McBride said the dioxin appears to form when chlorine is used to bleach wood pulp white. Asked whether the agency would place limits on dioxin in paper-plant effluents, he said, &quot;Clearly we're moving in that direction.&quot;    Currently, EPA officials said, a Dow Chemical Co. plant in Midland, Mich., is the only facility in the nation with restrictions on the dioxin that it can release in wastewater.    But concerns about dioxin contamination have led to changes in methods of disposing sludge from water treatment units at some paper plants, according to Charles Sutfin, director of water regulation in the EPA's Midwest regional office in Chicago. In the past, he noted, the sludges often were disposed of by spreading them on land. Since that could spread dioxin into food crops, he said, the practice has been limited or stopped.    Greenpeace, the environmental group, charged that the EPA has delayed the release of the dioxin study because it is keeping secret the results of the paper industry testing. An EPA spokesman, David Cohen, called that charge &quot;patently absurd.&quot; He said the dioxin survey and the paper industry studies will be released soon. </TEXT></DOC>
