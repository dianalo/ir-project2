Seymour has been the Transportation Department's assistant secretaryfor administration since 1985.andP;  He served as deputy assistant secretary foradministration from 1983 through 1985.andM;Previously, Seymour had been DOT's deputy director of personnel, responsiblefor personnel management, training and labor relations programs.andM;Seymour began his federal career in 1969 at the Justice Department where heheld administrative and personnel positions before joining DOT.andM;He received a bachelor's degree in sociology from the University of Virginiain 1967 and a master's degree in public administration from the University ofWashington in 1978.andM;Seymour, 45, runs 20 to 30 miles each week and hopes to break 40 minutes in a10-kilometer race soon.andP;  He also enjoys playing basketball and coaches hisdaughter Nancy's basketball team.andM;GCN Staff writer James M. Smith interviewed Seymour in his office at DOTheadquarters in Washington.andM;GCN: What is your role in IRM?andM;SEYMOUR: I am the senior IRM official and the liaison with the GeneralServices Administration, Office of Management and Budget and other agenciesin government as well as in the Transportation Department.andM;The real answer is that I am just the manager of the IRM process.andP;  I relyvery heavily on people like Bob Woods for help on the technical part.andP;  I tryto provide some of the leadership and management support for effective IRM.andM;I guess I'll never be able to say whether you need a 286 or a 386.andP;  I rely onothers to do that.andM;But once we've strategized and we've got the technical input, I'm going tohelp get us where we ought to go and figure out the best way to get there.andM;GCN: You recently held your second annual IRM conference.andP;  What did you hopeto accomplish?andM;SEYMOUR: We focused on input from the operating administrations.andP;  We talkedabout the Office Automation Technology and Services (OATS) contract, aboutour plans for local area networks, about executive information systems (EIS)and their potential application to DOT.andM;I think the term EIS is misplaced and potentially confusing.andP;  It seems to methat in a relatively short period of time, managers and analysts are going towant the capability of these EIS systems to cut across data avenues and mixand match and compare and contrast data.andP;  That is where the payoff is.andM;GCN: Having been an IBM Corp. executive in the late 1960s, TransportationSecretary Samuel Skinner appreciates automation.andP;  Has Skinner's leadershipmade your job easier?andM;SEYMOUR: The secretary certainly has made the job easier.andP;  He wants to giveemployees the tools they need to do the job.andP;  He's energetic and smart, sohe's a lot of help.andM;He also is very capable of pushing us to go beyond what we've accomplished inthe past.andP;  So while he's fun and easy to work for, he's also a man with veryhigh expectations.andM;GCN: What was the state of IRM in the Office of the Secretary two years ago,and where are you now?andM;SEYMOUR: That is a broad question.andP;  Look at it in two phases.andM;One is the capability of our IRM staff.andP;  I think over the last couple ofyears we've made tremendous progress in our IRM capabilities and the staff'scapabilities.andM;Bob Woods has brought in new talent, and blended that with the talent healready had, to give us outreach capability and credibility within thedepartment and among other agencies.andM;In the Office of the Secretary, I think there are two applications worthtalking about.andM;First, our office automation has improved tremendously.andP;  We've got a goodplan to provide our people with office automation and common systems and theability to exchange data.andP;  They don't have this potpourri of systems thatwe've had in the past.andM;The other piece of hands-on IRM work that the Office of the Secretary does isin our Transportation Computer Center (TCC), which operates theadministrative mainframe for the department.andM;Dennis Chastain, who runs the TCC, and his staff have done a very fine jobfor us over the last couple of years.andP;  They have turned TCC into a first-ratefacility.andM;GCN: How would you assess automation across the board in DOT?andM;SEYMOUR: I would say that, like most government agencies, we're behind thetechnology curve.andP;  We think we are making good progress in terms of sharinginformation among the different parts of the department.andP;  We've made somedecent progress in keeping up with technology and standardization, primarilythrough OATS.andM;GCN: Secretary Skinner has called for revision of the National TransportationPolicy (NTP).andP;  What will this mean for IRM planning policy across thedepartment and in the secretary's office?andM;SEYMOUR: What the secretary is looking at really is not new IRM policy but anIRM activity that supports the department's mission, which the NTP lays outthrough the year 2000 and beyond.andM;There is a major effort under way now to identify what we call modalspecifics in the Federal Highway Administration, National Highway TrafficSafety Administration, Federal Railroad Administration -- the specific kindsof data each operating administration needs to run its programs.andM;Then come the common databases that affect commodities and people and cutacross traditional modal lines.andM;That's at the large-scale end.andP;  At the smaller-scale end, the secretary wantsto ensure that our work force has the best possible equipment, training andlogistic support to get its job done.andM;GCN: GSA has begun a review of your department.andP;  What do you expect it tofind?andM;SEYMOUR: I think GSA will find we do an awful lot of our work very well, thatwe've got a very dedicated and hard-working staff in all our operatingadministrations -- a staff that wants to do the job right.andP;  That's probablymost important.andP;  I don't want to downplay that.andM;On the other hand, anytime you come in and look at a major department withmajor initiatives, you are going to find some problems.andP;  We expect that.andP;  Isuspect we are going to be asked to do a better job acquainting people withthe Federal IRM Regulations and requirements.andM;We probably are going to be asked to do a better job with some of our systemdesigns and requirements at the front end.andP;  We hope to talk to GSA about thefindings and have a chance to comment.andP;  We still are naive enough to look atthese things as an opportunity to do a better job.andP;  And that is how we'llview it.andM;GCN: What has been your most satisfying accomplishment since becomingassistant secretary for administration and your most difficult challenge?andM;SEYMOUR: I think those are almost reverse sides of the same coin.andP;  Probablythe most satisfying accomplishment is putting together a foundation for agood IRM office.andM;In 1979, the predecessor of the IRM office was a part of our overallmanagement office.andP;  IRM didn't even stand on its own.andP;  It was a neophyte inthe early 1980s, an organization looking for a mission and trying to find outwhat it should do.andM;With John Turner as the director for a period of time, and then Bob Woodsmost recently and for a longer term, I think we've got the foundation of avery good staff and a lot of credibility in the department and outside.andM;The challenge is almost the same thing.andP;  Now that we've got a good staff andsome idea of what we are all about, we look at the work that's got to be doneand we scratch our heads and wonder, &quot;How in heaven's name are we going toget it done?&quot;andM;So the challenge is to figure out how to accomplish the task that we seebefore us in terms of data collection, data sharing, information sharing.andP;  Iguess the watchwords are fairly simple: You want current technology, you wantit economically, you want it flexible.andM;That's the challenge.andP;  Whether it's mainframes, office automation, whatever,that's the challenge.andM;GCN: In your view, what are the key IRM policy issues?andM;SEYMOUR: Probably two or three.andP;  One is that we have an awful lot of IRMactivity related to our major systems acquisitions for the Coast Guard andFederal Aviation Administration.andM;It's just the ability to define what you need, and then work it through theacquisition structure and then the development structure.andP;  It's tough here,but it's tough everywhere.andM;How you plan for those things, how you budget for them and bring them offclose to or on time with the budget, is a tough issue governmentwide.andM;I think the way we acquire automated support, the whole acquisition processfor computers and software, is something that we have got to get fixed.andP;  Ittakes too long, it's too complex and convoluted.andM;That's something I've had as a goal while working on the systems committee ofthe President's Council on Management Improvement.andP;  I think it is beginningto make some headway.andP;  A lot of folks are interested in it, and hopefullywe'll come up with some suggestions working with GSA and other assistantsecretaries for IRM.andM;GCN: How has DOT IRM been a success?andM;SEYMOUR: I tend not to dwell on success too much.andP;  You just get things doneand go on to the next thing.andP;  I am very pleased with the work Bob has doneand very pleased with the progress that office has made and very concernedabout how much farther we have to go.andM;I'm pleased about the OATS program, the fact that the department cametogether with FAA as executive agent, and we were able to share requirementsand opportunities in a smart way.andP;  I think that really is a milestone.andM;The other thing I'm pleased with is the work we've done with our automatedfinancial management system.andP;  It started several years ago with a directivefrom OMB.andM;Our first effort was to work with other agencies in government, the GeneralAccounting Office and OMB, to come up with standard general ledgers so we allhad the same terminology, same charts and that kind of thing.andP;  That was achallenge that was successfully met.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
