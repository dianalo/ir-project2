(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Tape storage system provides high capacity and removable media.andP;  But becauseit takes minutes to access a single file and requires tedious tapepositioning, it usually serves as an archive device.andP;  A high-capacity harddisk drive offers speed.andP;  But since it's not removable, it can't securesensitive data as effectively as you might like.andM;By combining removable media, storage capacities of over 600MB, and dataaccess times similar to those of XT hard disk drives, erasable-optical (E-O)disk drives occupy a niche between high-capacity tapes and large hard disks.andO;With typical list prices of $5,000 to $7,000, they are more expensive thaneither tape systems or LAN-server hard disks, but they're considerably fasterthan the former and provide two to six times as much storage as the latter.andO;Devices like Pinnacle Micro's REO-650 ($4,995 plus $995 for interface kit),Advanced Graphics Applications' AGA Discus Rewritable ($6,495), and MicroDesign's LaserBank 60OR ($6,995) are perfectly suited to holdinghigh-integrity master copies of application programs and database files andare also appropriate for fast, on-the-fly archiving of data.andM;The REO-650, AGA Discus, and LaserBank 600R use the same random data accessarchitecture as floppy or hard disks, so data access is acceptably fast.andO;Read operations are about as fast as those of a hard disk in an old XT, andwrite operations are also slower than those of today's typical hard disks.andO;In each of the three devices, i laser uses its heat to write and its light toread the data on an E-0 platter.andP;  Erasing is done with laser heat in thepresence of an intense magnetic field.andP;  The laser in each of these drivesreads and writes to only one side of the disk at a time, requiring you toflip the disk over to access the data on the other side.andP;  Formatting each ofthese disks takes about 25 minutes, and each vendor provides software forpartitioning the disks.andM;Each of the three models uses the Sony E-O drive, a 5.25 inch unit capable ofinternal or external mounting.andP;  The optical platter resides in a cartridgeresembling a 3.5-inch floppy disk drive that has grown to 6.0 by 5.3 inchesand has gained a long shutter door.andP;  Inside the cartridge is a 5-inch opticalplatter with two hard-coded sectors.andP;  All three of die disks we tested havetwo sector-formatting schemes: 512 bytes per sector and 1,024 bytes persector.andM;When formatted, the 512-byte-per-sector disks amount to 297MB per side, andare sold as 600MB disks.andP;  The 1,024-byte-per-sector disks format to 323MB perside, and are sold as 650MB disks.andP;  After writing, the expected life of E-Omedia is 10 years or more.andM;The software accompanying the AGA Discus and LaserBank 60OR drives (both ofwhich use SCSI interface cards) has patches to extend the DOS 3.x boundary toallow partitions as large as 322MB.andP;  Because of Compaq DOS 3.31 and DOS 4's32-bit sector-numbering scheme, no patching is required to access partitionsof up to 322MB.andM;Each unit comes with menu-driven software: The LaserBank 60OR's softwareperforms installation, diagnostics, formatting, and partitioning.andP;  To thesefunctions the REO-650 software adds password protection for the menu systemand drive-door locking.andP;  The AGA Discus software has a confirmation ofcorrect installation,  in additionandM;You can use all three E-O drives on network servers as well as withstandalone PCs.andP;  Although it is possible to use an E-0 drive as a sharednetwork drive, its slow throughput (compared with that of a typical LANserver drive) makes it impractical to share among several workstations onmore than a casual basis.andM;Although E-O drives present little competition for LAN server drives in termsof speed or for tape systems in terms of price, they win on security-if yourcompany has instituted proper controls and procedures.andP;  Backup tapes areremovable and transportable but also subject to erasure by airport X-raymachines and magnetic forces.andP;  E-O disks 0 must be exposed simultaneously tointense laser heat and magnetism for destruction to occur, and they can beremoved and locked away for safekeeping.andP;  They may be expensive, but thenwhat value do you place on your data?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
