In the 1985 fourth quarter, UAL had net income of $20.8 million, or 43 cents a share. Revenue rose 24% to $2.34 billion from $1.89 billion a year earlier.    The company's United Airlines unit posted a $31.1 million loss for the quarter, compared with profit of $12.6 million a year earlier.    United's fourth-quarter passenger traffic grew 48% from a year earlier, but fare discounting cut revenue, the company said.    For the year, UAL posted a profit of $11.6 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with a loss of $48.7 million in 1985. The company, which also operates hotels and a car rental company, said revenue for 1986 increased 44% to $9.2 billion from $6.4 billion.    The United Airlines unit posted a loss of $80.6 million for 1986. In 1985, the unit had a net loss of $88.2 million.    UAL's 1986 earnings would have dipped into the red if it hadn't been for an accounting change taken in the second quarter that boosted the value of certain of its aircraft.    As of April 1, the company changed the way it estimated the useful lives and residual values of certain planes. The accounting change reduced UAL's fourth-quarter expenses by $26.8 million, or 29 cents a share, and cut full-year costs by $80.6 million, or 95 cents a share.    Richard J. Ferris, UAL chairman and chief executive officer, blamed the company's poor performance on high operating costs at the United Airlines subsidiary.    &quot;United's labor expense, in particular, is higher than many of its competitors, and the costs for integrating the Pan American Pacific assets into United's operations were greater than anticipated,&quot; he said. United acquired the Pacific routes of Pan American World Airways in February 1986.    United said it planned to cut costs for 1987 by lowering labor expenses and streamlining operations. A UAL spokesman said he couldn't elaborate on how that would be accomplished.    Also in the fourth quarter, UAL didn't take previously planned investment tax credits of about $30 million due to recent federal tax law changes.    UAL's other two main operating units each reported small profits in the fourth quarter. The company's Hertz car rental and leasing subsidiary, acquired from RCA Corp. in August 1985, contributed net income of $3.8 million in the quarter, up 23% from $3.1 million in the 1985 quarter. For all 1986, Hertz recorded net income of $49.2 million.    The company's Westin hotel unit added $5.4 million to fourth quarter net income, down 31% from $7.8 million in the year-earlier quarter. For 1986 the hotel subsidiary's net income was $75.2 million, a nearly three-fold increase from net income of $25.1 million in 1985.    UAL issued the earnings report after the market closed yesterday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, UAL closed at $55.625, down 87.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
