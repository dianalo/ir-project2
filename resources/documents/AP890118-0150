Vanden Boeynants' son, Christian, said the family has ``receivedno sign of life of my father up to now.''   ``We haven't had the least contact with the kidnappers and thus,there are no negotiations,'' he said on national BRT radio. It wasthe first public reaction from the family since Vanden Boeynantsdisappeared Saturday.   Authorities considered broadcasting a phone call taped Monday inwhich a man claiming to represent the Revolutionary SocialistBrigade said the group was holding the former leader.   The caller said the brigade would return Vanden Boeynants ``inlittle pieces.'' Investigators hope the public might be able toidentify the voice.   The brigade demanded the equivalent of $789,000 in a letter totwo newspapers, but did not provide proof it actually held the69-year-old politician or that he was still alive.   Officials have expressed concern about the health of VandenBoeynants, who needs heart medicine when under stress.   ``My mother, my sister and myself are very worried,'' ChristianVanden Boeynants said on the radio.   ``Anyone who has information on this subject is asked to contactthe coordination center,'' the police appeal said. It wasdistributed by the national news agency Belga.   The brigade said in a letter to the Brussels newspapers Le Soirand Het Laatste Nieuws on Tuesday that the politician will have toappear before a ``People's Tribunal'' for corruption and allegedmisuse of funds and could face the ``supreme'' sanction.   Vanden Boeynants received a three-year suspended sentence in 1986for financial fraud as head of his meat packaging business and isunder parliamentary investigation for allegedly accepting bribes asdefense minister in the 1970s.   The brigade called Vanden Boeynants ``a corrupt person ... whohas stolen large public funds for his own profit.''   About 10 claims of responsibilty have been made since VandenBoeynants disappeared, but in most cases the authenticity wasdoubtful, said deputy Brussels Prosecutor Andre Vandoren.   The brigade demanded that two-thirds of the ransom money go torelief agencies.   Experts of left-wing terrorism said the group's letter was``amateurish.'' ``Such poor language wouldn't be tolerated by groupslike the Red Army Faction ... the Red Brigades or Action Directe,''said Rudolf Boehm, a professor at Ghent University.   Vanden Boeynants disappeared near his home in a posh Brusselsneighborhood late Saturday. The cover of a syringe found near hishome had traces of a tranquilizer.   Vanden Boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and againfrom late 1978 until early 1979 and was also defense minister forseven years in the 1970s.   He was a Brussels city councilor from 1952 until 1985 and wasre-elected in October.   As Public Works alderman in Brussels, he razed several oldneighborhoods to make way for high-rise buildings, and Brusselsbecame known for its destructive urban renewal. The brigade letternamed a Brussels construction company as one of Vanden Boeynants'business partners who must help contribute funds to the ransom.</TEXT></DOC>
