The court ruled 5-0 on Thursday that Paula Cooper should serve a60-year prison sentence for the stabbing death of an elderly Bibleteacher. Cooper committed the murder at age 15.   The court cited a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision generallybarring executions of killers who were under 16 at the time of thecrime, as well as a 1987 change in Indiana law that sets anidentical minimum age.   The Indiana law was passed after Cooper's crime and was notretroactive, but the Indiana Supreme Court said it would be unfairnot to apply it to her.   At the same time, the justices said, ``this is a difficultconclusion to reach because of the gruesome nature of Cooper'sacts.''   Attorney General Linley E. Pearson said the state had no groundsto appeal the ruling.   Cooper, now 19, pleaded guilty to the May 1985 slaying of Ruth E.Pelke, 78, of Gary. Pelke was stabbed 33 times with a butcher knifeafter Cooper and three friends went to her home on the pretext oftaking Bible lessons, then stabbed and robbed the woman.   Cooper, an inmate at the Indiana Women's Prison in Indianapolis,learned of the decision from prison superintendent Clarence Trigg.   ``It was a joyous occasion for her,'' Trigg said. ``She jumped upand down.''   Cooper must serve half of her 60-year term before she can applyfor parole.   While pursuing her appeal, Cooper gained wide support in Europe.Roman Catholics and some European leftist groups adopted her as thesymbol of their campaign against capital punishment. AmnestyInternational and the American Civil Liberties Union also enteredthe case on Cooper's behalf.   In 1987, Pope John Paul II wrote to then-Gov. Robert D. Orr toask for clemency for Cooper. This March, when the state court heardCooper's appeal, an Italian group called Non Uccidere, or Thou ShallNot Kill, presented a clemency petition with 1 million signatures tothe United Nations.   Michael Sutherlin, an Indianapolis attorney who works for AmnestyInternational, said the Cooper case ``really demonstrated howinappropriate the death penalty is as it is applied in thiscountry.''   In an unusual step, the Supreme Court cited in footnotes to itsopinion 11 news articles about the international protest andlegislative maneuvering following Cooper's sentence.   While sparing Cooper from the electric chair, the Supreme Courtsaid the circumstances surrounding her crime ``clearly support thenext most severe penalty under the statute, namely, the maximumsentence of imprisonment.''</TEXT></DOC>
