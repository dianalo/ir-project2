<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-10-1243 </DOCNO><TEXT>The concept of the effective action in quantum field theory was introducedinto physics by Julian Schwinger in 1954. The effective action summarizes,in a single functional, all the quantum properties of the fields underconsideration. The functional derivative of the effective action yieldsthe effective field equations, which replace the classical field equationsas descriptors of the dynamical behavior of quantized fields. Solutionsof these equations are 'in-out' matrix elements of the field operatorsand, when substituted back into the effective action itself, yield logarithmsof the corresponding 'in-out' amplitudes. The classical field equationsare gauge covariant, a fact that derives from the gauge invariance ofthe classical action. One has learned how to construct effective actionsthat are similarly gauge invariant (in each order of perturbation theory)and that yield effective field equations having the covariance propertiesof their classical analogs. Despite this advance, problems remain, stemmingfrom the fact that there is not one but an infinite number of gauge invarianteffective actions, one for every background-covariant choice of supplementaryconditions and ghost fields. Vilkovisky (1984) has argued persuasivelythat by requiring additionally that the effective action be invariantunder local invertible changes in the choice of basic field variables,one can construct a natural unique gauge invariant effective action.This lecture will examine Vilkovisky's ideas. 3 refs. refs.</TEXT></DOC>
