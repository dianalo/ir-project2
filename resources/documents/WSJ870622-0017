The Colts are &quot;continuously offered longer-term securities&quot; offered in the form of dollar-denominated issues with maturities ranging from three years to more than 30 years.    Currently, the World Bank has about $481 million of such securities outstanding in the form of fixed-rate or zero-coupon issues. There is an active secondary market in such securities, bank officials said.    The World Bank is planning to offer Colts as deep-discount bonds, with relatively low interest rates and long maturities, to attract investors who can't invest in the zero-coupon type issues. Later, the World Bank plans to offer variable-rate and amortizing securities on a continuous basis.    The 151-nation agency, which borrows money to finance its loans to developing nations, said the issues will be marketed by First Boston Corp., Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Morgan Stanley Inc. and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
