The {sup 14}C dates are,on the whole, compatible with the historical data, and thus show thata large proportion of the Mycenaean surficial coatings can be dated bythe radiocarbon method. However, in order to determine the age of themortars accurately, it is necessary to evaluate the amount of sedimentarycarbonate which may have been added to them. It is shown here that theoxygen and carbon isotope compositions of lime mortars are significantindicators that such a mixing actually took place.</TEXT></DOC>
