Cargo tank trucks operated separatelymust be equipped with a rear bumper or rear-end tank protection deviceas prescribed in andSection; 178.340-8(b) of the Hazardous Materials Regulations(HMR)(49 CFR Parts 171 through 199), as amended in this final rule. This action is being taken to provide operators of these cargo tank trucksreasonable time to bring their units into compliance with the HMR. Theremay be approximately 3500 affected units, which are being operated primarilyin the Western states in deliveries of gasoline, fuel oil and other petroleumdistillate products. The intended effect of this action is to bring thesecargo tank trucks into compliance with the HMR while minimizing economicimpact to motor carriers, the petroleum distillate industry, and the publicin the affected geographical areas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>July 1, 1989.

Background </ITAG>On August 8, 1986, RSPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(51 FR 28605) under Docket HM-183B, Notice No.86-6, which proposed to allow a 36-month period for cargo tank trucks manufacturedwithout the required rear bumpers to be brought into compliance with theHMR. Additionally, responses were solicited on several questions regardingthe incremental costs of installing rear bumpers on cargo tank trucks,the need for additional markings on non-conforming cargo tank trucks, thegrandfathering of existing non-conforming units, the relationship (if any)of the length of the tow bar to rear-end collisions, and frequencies ofoperating cargo tank trucks without a cargo tank full trailer. Eleven comments were received in response to the NPRM. Most industry representativesdisagreed with the proposal to require that cargo tank trucks be equippedwith a rear bumper, when operated in combination with a cargo tank fulltrailer. Reasons offered to support not requiring rear bumpers includedinstallation costs, loss of payload capacity due to the added bumper weight,and a satisfactory safety record indicating an absence of any serious safetyproblem for these units. Commenters stated, however, that should DOT requirerear bumpers, existing cargo tank trucks manufactured without rear bumpersshould be grandfathered to allow their continued use when operated in combinationwith a cargo tank full trailer. Additionally, they suggested that operationof these grandfathered units, without the full trailer, be allowed whenthey are being taken to a repair or maintenance facility. Two State agenciesexpressed support for the 36-month compliance period and a provision allowingthe operation of a cargo tank truck, without a rear bumper, to a repairor maintenance facility. In addition, they recommended that the provisionsbe extended to include other DOT specification cargo tank trucks whichare used in other than petroleum distillates service. Few commenters took exception to requiring the installation of rear bumperson units which are operated without cargo tank full trailers, with theexception of when a cargo tank truck is being taken to a repair or maintenancefacility. They stated that these cargo tank trucks are rarely operatedwithout the cargo tank full trailer attached. Another commenter objected to the proposed 36-month compliance period asbeing ``irresponsible,'' and requested the immediate enforcement of therear bumper requirement. The commenter stated that enforcement is a necessity,especially when the transportation of hazardous materials is involved.In response to the question raised in the NPRM concerning the method ofcertification of cargo tanks manufactured without rear bumpers, three commentersstated that the existing regulations in andSection; 178.340-10(a)(2) adequatelyaddress the requirement that a manufacturer must indicate specificationshortages on the manufacturer's certificate. In addition, one commenterstated the cargo tank metal certification plate could be marked ``withoutbumper.'' This notation would indicate that the cargo tank truck complieswith the specification requirements only when it is operated in combinationwith a trailer or when it is equipped with a rear bumper complying withandSection; 178.340-8(b). Four commenters provided information on incremental costs to install rearbumpers. Cost estimates for the installation of a rear bumper ranged froma low of $400 per vehicle to a high of $1800. When other incidental costsassociated with the installation of a rear bumper were included, such astransportation to and from the repair facility and loss of service of thecargo tank truck during the installation period, costs were estimated tobe between $1800 to $2690 per vehicle. Additionally, commenters statedthat a loss of product load would be incurred due to the added bumper weight,which would be between 100 to 500 pounds. One commenter specifically addressed the question on the effect the towbar length may have on safety. The commenter stated that the tow bar lengthis determined by the distance between the truck and trailer axles neededto meet bridge weight distribution requirements The commenter further statedthat under normal highway conditions the steering angle seldom exceeds15 degrees. Thus, the length of the tow bar does not result in significantexposure of the cargo tank truck to a rear-end collision.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion </ITAG>As stated in the NPRM, andSection; 178.340-8(b) has been in effect sinceDecember 1967, and similar bumper requirements have been in effect forpreviously manufactured specification cargo tanks since the early 1940's.Section 178.340-8(b) requires that all cargo tanks must be protected bythe use of a rear bumper. However, a large number of cargo tank trucksused in combination with cargo tank full trailers have been manufacturedwithout rear bumpers. The number of units manufactured without rear bumpersis estimated to be about 3,500. These combination units are used primarilyfor the transportation of gasoline, fuel oil and other petroleum distillateproducts.The NPRM issued under HM-183B was initiated following comments receivedunder a separate regulatory action published on September 17, 1985 (50FR 37766), under Docket Nos. HM-183, 183A. In the NPRM issued under HM-183,183A, RSPA denied several petitions for rulemaking that had requested thatrear-end tank protection be required only on the rearmost unit of a ``double''cargo tank motor vehicle configuration Commenters responding to the denialin HM-183, 183A stated that if immediate compliance is required, the economicimpact of removing all affected cargo tank trucks from service would imposea burden on affected motor carriers and on the public in those geographicalareas. RSPA and the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) Office of Motor Carriershave given full consideration to all comments and relevant factors in thedevelopment of this final rule. We believe that a rear bumper or othercargo tank protection device is a necessary safety requirement. There areindications that these ``double'' combinations are at times disconnectedand the cargo tank motor vehicle is operated singly in order to make adelivery. Further, there is the possibility that with some tow bar lengthsof up to 16 feet, an automobile (i.e. compact, subcompact, or even a mid-size)could strike the rear of the cargo tank truck, even when operated in combinationwith a full cargo tank trailer. However, we do acknowledge that immediate enforcement of the rear bumperrequirement may impose a burden on affected motor carriers by requiringthe removal of all affected vehicles from service at the same time, andon the general public by interrupting the delivery of petroleum distillatein the affected geographical areas. Because of the potential burden, weare allowing a 36-month time period for cargo tank operators to bring theirunits into compliance. By allowing this time period, little, if any, interruptionof petroleum product delivery should occur. This should also provide motorcarriers with sufficient time to bring their fleets into compliance ona periodic basis, such as during routine maintenance or repair operations.We are allowing the requirement for rear-end tank protection to be metby the use of a rear bumper as prescribed in existing andSection; 178.340-8(b)or by a rear-end tank protection device, that was proposed in HM-183, 183A(50 FR 37800, September 17, 1985; 50 FR 49866, December 5, 1985). Undercurrent andSection; 178.340-8(b) and as adopted in andSection; 178.340-8(b)(1)herein, the rear bumper serves two functions. First, as required by andSection;178.340-8, the bumper must protect the cargo tank and any tank componentthat may retain lading from damage as a result of a collision with anothervehicle or with a structure during backing. Second, as required by 49 CFR393.86, the bumper serves as a rear-end under-ride protection device toprotect occupants of any vehicle that may collide with the rear-end ofthe cargo tank. Under andSection; 178.340-8(b)(2), as adopted herein, therear-end tank protection device may be separate from the rear-end under-rideprotection device. However, in the latter situation, the manufacturer muststill satisfy the requirements in andSection; 393.86 to provide under-rideprotection. In the September 17 notice, RSPA proposed that a ``rear-end tank protectiondevice must be of a width and height adequate to protect the cargo tank* * * from damage that would result in loss of lading.'' Commenters respondingto the proposal requested that the width and height of the rear-end tankprotection device be defined. They argued that in the absence of any dimensionalinformation, any damage resulting in a loss of lading would constitutenoncompliance with the rear-end tank protection requirements on the partof the manufacturer. By prescribing a performance standard, RSPA intendedto allow a degree of flexibility in the design of the rear-end tank protectiondevice. However, we recognize the difficulty in designing a rear-end tankprotection device that takes into account all possible accident scenarioswhich could result in a loss of lading. Therefore, in the December 5, 1985 notice, RSPA proposed: ``The rear-endtank protection device must have a horizontal dimension at least equalto that of the cargo tank and a vertical dimension of at least 8 inches,and located at a height so as to minimize damage to the cargo tank, andits valves, fittings, or piping which could result in a possible loss oflading.'' Most commenters to the rear-end tank protection device requirementrequested that the final rule incorporate the dimensions currently specifiedin andSection; 393.86 for rear bumpers instead of the proposed requirements.As was discussed at the various public meetings held during the commentperiod, we believe the rear-end tank protection device must be positionedto provide the greatest degree of protection for the tank, piping, andfittings the device is designed to protect. The most appropriate locationfor the device might not be within the dimensions specified in andSection;393.86 for the height of the rear bumper. Therefore, the dimensions containedin andSection; 393.86, with the exception of that for the height, are specifiedin andSection; 178.340-8(b) in this final rule. The height of the devicemay not be more than 60 inches from the ground with the vehicle empty,as compared with a height of not more than 30 inches for the rear-end under-ridedevice. The height requirement of the device has been changed in orderto allow the rear-end protection device to be closer to the piping or fittingsit is designed to protect. This rule permits a rear-end protection devicewhich is notched, indented or has separated sections; prescribes the maximumtransverse distance from the widest part of the motor vehicle at the rearto the device; and clarifies the fact that this kind of device is allowedonly when the product piping at the rear of the cargo tank is equippedwith a sacrificial device, such as a shear section, outboard of a shut-offvalve. We believe these changes will offer persons, who prefer to havethe rear-end under-ride device separate from the rear-end tank protectiondevice, more flexibility in the design of the rear-end tank protectiondevice and flexibility in positioning this device in a manner where itwill offer the best protection to the tank and any piping or fitting. Accordingly,in addition to clarifying the requirements for the device, we have provideda range of alternative locations for the rear-end tank protection device. The 36-month compliance period being granted in this final rule appliesonly to those units that are operated in ``double'' combinations. However,a cargo tank truck, without a cargo tank full trailer attached, may betaken to a repair facility to be equipped with the required rear bumperor tank protection device. Any other operation of the cargo tank truckwithout a rear bumper or rear-end tank protection device remains a violationof the HMR and subject to enforcement actions. We also are limiting theprovision to cargo tank trucks used to transport gasoline and other petroleumdistillates. We received no request from industry representatives to extendthe provision to include other kinds of hazardous materials.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Administrative Notices </ITAG>Executive Order 12291 RSPA has determined that this final rule (1) is not ``major'' under ExecutiveOrder 12291; (2) is not ``significant'' under DOT's regulatory policiesand procedures (44 FR 11034); and (3) does not require an environmentalimpact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 U.S.C.4321 et seg. ). A regulatory evaluation is available for review. in thedocket. Impact on Small Businesses Commenters estimated that this regulation will effect no more than 3500vehicles, at costs ranging from $400 to $1800 per vehicle. Based on theseestimates, I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act. Executive Order 12612 I have reviewed this regulation in accordance with Executive Order 12612(``Federalism'') and have determined it has no substantial direct effectson the States, on the Federal-State relationship or the distribution ofpower and responsibilities among levels of government. Thus, this regulationcontains no policies that have Federalism implications, as defined in ExecutiveOrder 12612, and therefore no Federalism Assessment has been prepared.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>49 CFR Part 173 Hazardous materials transportation, Motor vehicles, Packaging and containers.49 CFR Part 178 Hazardous materials transportation, Packaging and containers.In consideration of the foregoing, Parts 173 and 178 are amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 173_SHIPPERS_GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SHIPMENTS AND PACKAGINGS</ITAG>1 The authority citation for Part 173 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>49 App. U.S.C. 1803, 1804, 1805, 1806, 1807, 1808;49 CFR Part 1, unless otherwise noted.</ITAG>2.
