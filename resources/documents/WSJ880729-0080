American Bankers Association President Charles Pistor said his group will &quot;strongly oppose&quot; the bill despite its offer of new securities-underwriting powers to banks. The bankers' displeasure, combined with opposition from the securities industry, leaves the bill highly vulnerable to delay this late in an election-year Congress.    The panel approved its bank legislation at about 3 a.m. yesterday after a 17-hour session of votes, debates and private negotiations. But the 31-20 vote fell short of the strong support needed to give the measure legislative momentum.    Several lobbyists said the bill came within a few votes of being defeated. On the final vote, a handful of members initially withheld their votes, these lobbyists said, and would have voted to kill the bill if its opponents appeared likely to succeed.    The bankers association's Mr. Pistor complained that marketing restrictions and capital requirements &quot;would prevent most banks from offering&quot; the bill's new securities-underwriting services. He also protested restrictions in the bill on bank ventures in insurance and real estate. And his organization continued to call the consumer-service requirements of the bill &quot;unworkable.&quot;    In the committee's marathon meeting, consumer-oriented provisions were the last to be approved, 36-15, after Chairman Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.) presided over a private negotiating session with bankers and consumer advocates.    Most galling to bank lobbyists was the expansion of community groups' ability to hamper bank activities. Currently, groups often block regulatory approval of bank mergers with charges that banks have failed to make enough loans in low-income neighborhoods. Banks said that under the bill, such challenges could block bank moves to make even minor changes in their businesses. And they said the bill would force banks with only &quot;average&quot; community-service ratings to make new local lending commitments in order to overcome a challenge.    Consumer groups said the requirements are needed to force banks to comply with federal mandates that they serve local credit needs.    Joe Bellew, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group for retail bankers, said the provision makes banks vulnerable to blackmail. &quot;It's the return of the Barbary pirates,&quot; he complained.    The bill would require that banks establish low-cost checking accounts for the poor, which banks said could be moneylosers. It also mandates that banks cash any government check for $1,500 or less, despite bank claims that this would spawn widespread check fraud.    The committee tried to mollify bank objections. The compromise bill would let the Federal Reserve Board set bank fees for the &quot;lifeline&quot; checking account so it wouldn't cause bank losses. The compromise lowered the government check-cashing ceiling from the earlier proposal of $3,000, let banks charge a $2 fee per check, and let banks reject a government check if banks have &quot;reason to believe&quot; that it is phony or altered.    The bill also would set a 90-day deadline for regulators to rule on bank applications that have been challenged on community-investment grounds. Currently, banks complain, challenges can delay applications indefinitely.    The bill is expected to be referred to the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is friendlier to the securities industry. That panel may roll back some of the Banking Committee's broad approval for banks to underwrite corporate debt, commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds, mutual funds and some convertible debt.    But with the securities firms, mutual funds and most banks against the bill, the measure could be stalled while time runs out for action. Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) predicted such a fate. &quot;The bill has unified the lobbyists,&quot; he said, &quot;for every person that wants the bill passed, there are 100 against it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
