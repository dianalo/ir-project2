Overly generous loans to insiders has been a factor in thefailure of many banks and thrifts. One of the proposed ruleswould prohibit FDIC-regulated banks from investing in realestate in which bank insiders have an equity interest. Otherproposals would impose new record-keeping and disclosurerequirements to monitor potential conflicts, require boardapproval of certain transactions, and set an &quot;arms-length&quot;standard for dealings between banks and their insiders.</LP><TEXT>   An official at the American Bankers Association said thatmany of the proposals resemble existing state laws, but thatthe FDIC would have more enforcement clout. The associationis worried about new paper work burdens the regulations couldimpose. The FDIC asked for public comment by Oct. 7.   If adopted, the FDIC regulations would apply to about7,500 federally insured, state-chartered banks that aren'tmembers of the Federal Reserve System. These banks aregenerally small. The Comptroller of the Currency, whichsupervises about 4,000 federally chartered banks, and theFed, which supervises about 1,000 state banks, are draftingsimilar regulations.</TEXT></DOC>
