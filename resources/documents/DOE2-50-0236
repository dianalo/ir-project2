In this sequence, the most significant dates are neither thoseof the beginning nor of the end, but that of the transition between theperiod of increase and the period of decline. The petroleum industryin the conterminous US is by now sufficiently advanced in its evolutionthat several lines of evidence are consistent in their indication ofthe approximate degree of that advancement. One suite of diagnostic datacomprises the cumulative production, cumulative proved discoveries, andproved reserves. For more than 40 years the curve of cumulative productionof crude oil has closely followed that of cumulative discoveries, witha time lag of about 10-12 years. The peak in the rate of proved discoveryoccurred about 1956. The peak in proved reserves, which should occurabout midway between the peaks in the rates of discovery and of production,actually occurred at about 1961. The peak in production rate should occurin the late 1960's. Another suite of data is provided by successive studiesmade by the Petroleum Administration for war and by the National PetroleumCouncil, in which the oil discovered has been allocated to the yearsof discovery of the producing fields. These, when corrected to an estimatedultimate growth, indicate that by the end of 1966 about 136 billion bblof producible crude oil had been discovered. The rate of discovery peryear, averaged for successive 5-year periods, reached a peak of 3.57x 10{sup 9} bbl/yr during the period 1935-1940, and has declined subsequentlyto a present rate of less than 2 x 10{sup 9} bbl/yr.</TEXT></DOC>
