In the past, only party-approved candidates were able to run forParliament.   Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said opposition leaderswere willing to discuss with authorities the partially democraticelectoral system, which also would reserve a portion of seats forcandidates backed by the Communist Party.   But they indicated it appeared acceptable only if other politicalreforms were made, such as allowing access to the mass media,ensuring independent courts and guaranteeing the right to formassociations.   ``We would like the elections to be as open as possible, so thatfor example Solidarity candidates could compete with governmentcandidates, but it seems that the government wants to avoid suchcompetition,'' Onyszkiewicz said at a news conference.   ``The authorities expect our approval of an electoral procedureproposed for the nearest elections that will not be 100 percentdemocratic. And we did accept this principle,'' he said.   He said the proposal was made at the latest talks betweenauthorities and opposition representatives on political and socialreforms in Poland.   Jacek Kuron, a senior Solidarity adviser, said the oppositionalso was told at the talks the proposed election procedure would bea one-time proposition and that subsequent elections would betotally democratic.   But he cautioned, ``A declaration as such has no significance.What is significant is (increasing) the broad democratic process''through other political reforms, he said.   Under the government proposal, each election district would havetwo to five seats, and the opposition and authorities would decidein advance which seats could be contested among independentcandidates and which would be reserved for officially backedcandidates.   ``In comparison to what we have had, this is a great step forward... It opens the road to political freedom,'' said BronislawGeremek, chairman of the Solidarity side of the working group onpolitical reform.   The breakdown between the two camps was not discussed Saturday,Onyszkiewicz said. Party sources have said privately they envision asystem where 60 percent of the seats would be reserved for the partyand its allies, and 40 percent to independent candidates linked tothe Roman Catholic Church or Solidarity.   Anyone who collected 5,000 signatures could run for Parliament,but both sides would observe a ``gentleman's agreement'' not to runin each other's districts, a high-ranking party source said.   ``This is a very important, radical change in comparison with allother election systems after the war. We treat this as a step toadditional changes in the future,'' said Janusz Reykowski, aPolitburo member who led the official side in Saturday's talks.   The government proposal was the latest development in a two-weekseries of talks between authorities and the opposition.   So far, officials have agreed in principle to legalize the bannedSolidarity union under terms acceptable to it, to register thebanned farmers' group Rural Solidarity, to allow independentorganizations their own press and to ease censorship.   Such concessions on the part of communist authorities would haveseemed impossible only one year ago.   But in the all-or-nothing format laid down by Interior MinisterCzeslaw Kiszczak at the beginning of the talks Feb. 6, none of theagreements will be valid unless the talks as a whole succeed.   That means that Solidarity and authorities still must agree on aneconomic program and on the political reforms.   The unprecedented series of talks first were proposed by thegovernment during a wave of strikes in August that underscoredgrowing social tensions caused by 60-70 percent inflation and marketshortages.   It is the first time since communism took hold in Eastern Europethat party officials have held wide-ranging, formal negotiationswith independent elements of society over how the political andeconomic system should be restructured.</TEXT></DOC>
