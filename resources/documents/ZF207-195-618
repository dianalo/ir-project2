(attitudes).andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Stone Says RCAS Is Safe but Redundancy Is NotandM;Responding to a report that he was considering killing the Reserve ComponentAutomation Systems (RCAS) program, Undersecretary of the Army Michael P.W.andO;Stone said recently he fully supports the National Guard's developmentproject.andP;  But he hinted if RCAS duplicates existing systems, he might opt touse those systems instead.andM;&quot;It has never occurred to me to want to kill RCAS,&quot; Stone said.andP;  But he saidperhaps &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars&quot; of the projected RCAS cost might beearmarked for &quot;duplicate solutions that already exist and have been paid forin the active component or that will be fielded in the near future.&quot;andM;After almost 10 years of false starts, the RCAS program staff last monthreleased a 10,000-page functional description.andP;  Stone said the fully fieldedprogram could cost as much as $700 million.andM;&quot;The functional description describes a whole range of things the RCAS systemis supposed to do,&quot;&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;[My] concern about redundnacy is that thefunctional description translates into a request for proposals that willrequire the contractor to provide a system, or software, that already existsin the Army.&quot;andM;Stone added it might &quot;duplicate in RCAS those things that already exist inthe Army and could be used satisfactorily in the reserve components as well.&quot;andM;The Army's director of information systems for command, control,communications and computers recommended recently that the services use theexisting Standard Army Management Information System (STAMIS) to accomplishthe RCAS automation mission [GCN, March 20].andM;Stone would not comment directly on the proposal to shift the RCAS mission toSTAMIS, an option Congress rejected in 1987.andP;  A congressional reportcharacterized STAMIS as part of a &quot;hodgepodge of obsolete computers andsystems already in the field or otherwise available to the reservecomponent.&quot;andM;Congress at that time also transferred management authority for RCAS to theNational Guard Bureau and restricted the use of existing Army systems.andM;Stone said he believed Congress was &quot;concerned that some of the technologythe Army has may not represent state-of-the-art technology because it may bebased on procurements that were done five years ago.&quot;andP;  But, he said, &quot;My jobis to look at the total resources required and help ensure that the solutionthat's procured makes good management sense.&quot;andM;Stone said the Army's recent decision to adopt a 10-year-old Air Forcepayroll computer system was a case where buying state-of-the-art technologywould have been a high management risk.andM;He said the payroll system is &quot;not what the Air Force would use if [it] werestarting all over again.&quot;andP;  But, he said, &quot;In terms of cost-effectiveness, itdelivers a quality product, and there are very few complaints about it.&quot;andM;Stone drew a hypothetical parallel between the payroll system decision andRCAS.andM;&quot;If I were in the reserve component and concerned about my ability tomobilize, I would rather have proven, known, debugged technology availabletoday than what will probably not come out of RCAS for three or four years,&quot;he said.andM;Stone also said half of the microcomputers associated with the Army'sTactical Army Combat Service Support Systems (TACCS), bought under a 1987contract, were designated by Congress for the reserves.andM;He suggested software developed under RCAS might be made compatible with theTACCS micros.andP;  &quot;And,&quot; he added, &quot;some of the software we're using could betranslated to RCAS as well.andP;  That's how you might deal with redundancy.andM;&quot;If something with a certain clock speed and a certain memory capacity orwhatever .andP;  .  .  is needed in the active Army, and the same capacity isneeded by the reserves, I'm not saying the reserves have to use the same boxor that it even has to be interoperable.andP;  I'm not saying the reserves shouldbe denied the hardware inventory.andM;&quot;It's just that I want to make sure it's compatible with the equipemnt wehave and can run the same software,&quot; Stone said.andM;Stone also denied that the RCAS budget is easy to cut because of the problemsthe system has faced.andP;  &quot;Everyone recognizes the need of the reserves and theneed for a solution to the requirements they have,&quot; he said, &quot;and I don'tthink we have any intent of cutting it.&quot;andM;He did acknowledge recent cuts to the RCAS budget but attributed thosereductions to projections showing RCAS behind schedule.andP;  &quot;If we're wrong,&quot; hesaid, &quot;we'll have a budget scrub early next year and fix it.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
