Everyone wonders how neighbors, police and social workers failed to help. Authorities from teachers to a highway toll collector did report the abuse. The father was questioned, but officials say they didn't do more because of the &quot;constitutional&quot; conflict between protecting children and parents' privacy rights. Recall how Joe Biden, Larry Tribe and the others scored Judge Bork for rejecting the Warren Court's &quot;generalized right to privacy.&quot; Judge Bork objected that no blanket privacy right exists in the Constitution -- and is a mad idea. He asked whether there is a right to drug taking, price fixing or wife beating in private. To this list, liberals should add whether they think there is a right to assault a child in the privacy of the home. </TEXT></DOC>
