To understand the basisfor this developmental shift away from dependence on enhancer function,the authors investigated the relationship between transcriptional activityand methylation status of the immunoglobulin {kappa}-light-chain genes({kappa} genes) in mouse cell lines representing different stages ofB-cell maturation. Using pre-B-cell lines in which the level of a critical{kappa} enhancer-binding factor, NF-{kappa}B, was controlled by the administrationof withdrawal of lipopolysaccharide and plasmacytoma lines that eithercontain or lack this factor, they studied the properties of endogenous{kappa} genes and of transfected {kappa} genes which were stably integratedinto the genomes of these cells. In the pre-B cells, the exogenous (originallyunmethylated) {kappa} genes, as well as the endogenous {kappa} genes,were fully methylated and persistently dependent on enhancer function,even after more than 30 generations in a transcriptionally active state.In plasmacytoma cells, the endogenous {kappa} genes were invariably hypomethylated,whereas exogenous {kappa} genes were hypomethylated only in cells thatcontain NF-{kappa}B and are thus permissive for {kappa} enhancer function.These results indicate that the linkage of hypomethylation to enhancer-dependentactivation of {kappa} transcription occurs after the pre-B-cell stageof development. The change in methylation status, together with associatedchanges in chromatin structure, may suffice to eliminate or lessen theimportance of the enhancer for the maintenance of the transcriptionallyactive state.</TEXT></DOC>
