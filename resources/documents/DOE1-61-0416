This demerit was removed byplacing an inclined plate at the bottom of the upper chamber whereina molten crystal solution is stored and allowing all the crystal solutionare flown into the crystal growing chamber. This prevents the changein the growing crystal composition due to the occurence of ungrown portionor charge in the composition of the molten composition. (2 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
