First Jersey, a New York-based investment firm that recently sold its retail brokerage offices, agreed in January to pay the money to settle customers' claims that they paid excessive prices for stocks. The settlement, in which First Jersey didn't admit wrongdoing, is subject to a public hearing scheduled for March 27 in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia.    Maine has a separate lawsuit pending against First Jersey that accuses the firm of selling unregistered securities in the state. It seeks an unspecified amount of damages on behalf of Maine customers of the firm.    In an objection to the class-action settlement, filed with U.S. District Judge Charles R. Weiner, Maine accused First Jersey of deliberately mixing up company records to conceal the names of Maine customers who may also benefit from the state's suit. State officials claim that the settlement could deprive Maine investors of the chance to collect larger payments in state court. They also claim the firm didn't fully inform Maine customers of the implications of the settlement.    Peter J. Brann, an assistant attorney general handling the case, said yesterday that he inspected &quot;a whole bunch of documents&quot; at First Jersey headquarters last week as part of the state's suit. He said in reviewing computer printouts, it was difficult to sort out the Maine customers. He also said in the objection that some names of known Maine customers were missing.    Maine also is objecting to the settlement as inadequate.    Both First Jersey and lawyers for the suing customers criticized Maine's objections, which they said nonetheless shouldn't delay the settlement. Leonard Barrack, an attorney for First Jersey in Philadelphia, called Maine's objections &quot;total nonsense&quot; and added that Mr. Brann was &quot;probably looking for a headline.&quot;    Robert E. Brennan, First Jersey's founder and owner and a defendant in the class action, said yesterday that his firm cooperated with Maine over the past year and that the state's position is &quot;ridiculous.&quot; He accused Maine officials of trying to &quot;create a crisis atmosphere, which of course suits their real intent . . . to try to get some publicity for their department.&quot;    David Berger, an attorney in Philadelphia who negotiated the $10 million settlement for the suing customers, said he's &quot;not concerned&quot; about Maine's objection. &quot;We don't think the state of Maine has any standing whatsoever&quot; in the settlement, he added. A handful of customers in the class action also have objected to the settlement.    Of 350,000 notices mailed to First Jersey customers about the settlement, fewer than 50 were to Maine, lawyers involved in the case said.    About 30,000 current and former customers -- those who bought about 40 different securities from Oct. 1, 1980, to Sept. 30, 1986 -- are eligible for part of the $10 million. Mr. Berger, whose law firm had to set up a special phone number just to handle First Jersey customers' queries, said he expects about 50% of the eligible customers to file claims on the money, a high percentage for a class-action settlement, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
