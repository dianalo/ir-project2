States that fatiguehas been shown to be a major cause of rope deterioration and referenceis made to work carried out at the Silesian Wire and Rope Works 'Linodrut'in Zabrze where fatigue strength testing on wires from 10{sup 5} to 10{sup6} cycles failed to give a good correlation with conventional parametrictest results of tensile strength, contraflexing, torsion etc. The slopeof the Wohler curve in the range of fatigue strength for limit life isshown to be a straight line and it is suggested that the slope of thisline could be used as a basis for assessing the quality of wires intendedfor use in rope manufacture. Graphical illustrations of the relationshipof fatigue strength to wire diameter and to steel carbon content arealso given. It is strongly recommended that fatigue testing be introducedin the assessment of rope wire quality and that fatigue strength becomeone of the basic criteria in the assessment of rope quality. 9 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
