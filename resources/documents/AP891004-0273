Chairman L. William Seidman saidtoday.   ``It is possible that $50 billion will prove to be aninsufficient amount to deal with potential failures,'' Seidman saidin written testimony presented to the Senate Banking Committee.   ``But it is really much too early to make a reliable newprediction of loss,'' he added at the first hearing on the savingsand loan bailout since Congress passed the legislation Aug. 9.   Also testifying were Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady,Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Housing Secretary JackKemp, who are members of the oversight board setting policy for theResolution Trust Corp., created to close and sell failed thrifts.   Seidman, whose agency operates the RTC, said the government hastaken control of 283 failed Sandamp;Ls with $112 billion in assets. Ofthe 283, it has closed 24 small institutions and expects to sellfive large institutions by next week.   Through August 1992, thrift regulators may turn over another 300Sandamp;Ls to the RTC, bringing the total failures to nearly 600 withcombined assets exceeding $300 billion, he said.   Those projections ``raise questions about the adequacy of the$50 billion in RTC funding,'' Seidman said.   His written comments throw the strongest doubt yet on whetherone installment on the Sandamp;L bailout will be enough. However, in hisoral presentation to the committee, Seidman changed his toneslightly, saying, ``At this point we have no basis with which tomake a different estimate from the ($50 billion) one you've heard.''   Private analysts have been saying for months that $50 billionwould amount only to a substantial down payment on resolving theSandamp;L mess. Both Brady and Greenspan told the committee it is toosoon to know if the $50 billion is enough.   ``I think (it) isn't the point. Maybe we need 52, maybe we need48. THe point is we've taken a bonfire and tamped it down to thepoint where it's embers,'' Brady said.   Meanwhile, both Seidman and Brady, who heads a cabinet-leveloversight board setting policy for the RTC, reassured lawmakersthey are working to prevent any scandal in the Sandamp;L bailout.   ``Let us assure you that the oversight board is as anxious asthis committee to protect against conflicts of interest, politicalfavoritism and other improper actions by employees, agents,independent contractors and all others who perform services forboth the oversight board and the RTC,'' Brady said.   Members of Congress alarmed by the scandal at the Department ofHousing and Urban Development are trying to prevent similar abusesfrom developing at the RTC.   ``The potential problems at the RTC dwarf the substantialproblems the (Housing) secretary has thus far encountered at HUD,''said Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the SenateBanking Committee.   The RTC last week issued an interim ethics code governing thethousands of independent contractors it is expected to hire tomanage the real estate and other assets it is inheriting from thethrifts.   So far, the RTC has spent $20 billion: $1.8 billion to close the24 small Sandamp;Ls, $8.3 billion to handle five large institutions bynext week and five smaller not-yet-completed deals, $8.5 billion toreplace high-cost deposits and $1.4 billion as a reserve fund tohandle liquidity problems at thrifts that have failed but are stillopen, Seidman said.   Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson said inability to closethe five big cases by Sept. 30, the last day of fiscal 1989, meansthe reported federal budget deficit will be $8 billion higher infiscal 1990. However, he said that would not trigger automaticspending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law. The 1990 budget estimatetaken for determining those cuts was made on Aug. 15, he said.   Members of Congress also are looking at the division of theRTC's management, in which Brady's board sets its policy andSeidman's agency does the work.   ``No joint enterprise of any magnitude is without its healthyfrictions, and ours is no exception,'' Brady said. ``But overall wehave gotten off to an excellent start.''   Meanwhile, the oversight board announced Tuesday that it hasappointed Daniel P. Kearney, a Boston pension fund adviser andmortgage-backed securities expert, as its chief staff officer withthe title of president.   Kearney replaces Robson, who was filling the oversight boardpost on an interim basis.</TEXT></DOC>
