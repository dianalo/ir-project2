It is true that there is a litigation crisis, partly of our own making -- as in the case of prisoner (and other) civil-rights cases where the Supreme Court usually insists on allowing anyone to bring suit in federal court before making any attempt to utilize state remedies -- and partly that of the Congress -- as in its commission to us of secondhand-car dealers who turn back odometers, or untruthful small lenders, ordisappointed applicants for early Social Security. It is not true that law clerks decide cases. I sit on a court of appeals -- that for the Fifth Circuit, comprising federal appeals from Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas -- and in our court, as in most similar ones, cases are effectively decided in a conference of judges only, held immediately after oral argument and on the same day. In a small percentage of cases, further research and reflection may produce a different final result; but this is rare. Put another way, pause for a moment and ask yourself: Is it really very likely that a 23-or-so-year-old person fresh out of law school (no matter how brilliant) is going to exercise undue influence over someone like me? Someone who was first in his own law school class, who tried jury cases and argued appeals for 20 years as a practicing lawyer, and who has been on the federal bench for 13 years?    Nor is it true that they write our opinions. Last court year, I wrote well over half of my opinions from scratch, on a yellow pad with a lead pencil. Perhaps a third were initially drafted by my law clerks -- drafted to conform to a result and, in all but the simplest cases, to a course of reasoning given them beforehand by me. In this sense, and in this sense only, they were written by my clerks. But after the first draft, in most cases, they were torn apart and put back together by me; and in every case, I went over them word by word.    Now for my thanks: It was good of you to endorse the commission's proposal for increases in pay for us. I left a thriving law practice for the bench, confident that the financial sacrifice involved was one that I could live with. That was in 1973, and in 1969 the Congress had fixed the salary of a circuit judge at $42,500, a comfortable income in those times. I was earning something over twice this practicing law, as I recall; but I was proud to be appointed, glad to be of service, and -- the more fool I -- confident that, as Article III of the Constitution has it, such judges as I would receive &quot;a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.&quot; The 1969 figure, adjusted for inflation to 1987 dollars, would be over $130,000. The compensation of the office is, however, $83,200.    Qualified persons may well hesitate to step into our shoes when we are gone, given current compensation figures and the all but spiteful treatment accorded by the Congress to the reasonable expectations of those currently on the bench.    Thomas Gibbs Gee   Houston   ---   Unlike a law firm that can turn down clients to lessen its caseload, the American judicial system rests on the premise that everyone has a right to have a day in court. We recognize that many believe that current rules of liability should be narrowed; we believe, however, that changes in the law should respond to the demands of justice rather than to administrative convenience. Reducing the judicial caseload may be important, but it must be accomplished through fair means.    Marcia Isaacson   Judith Lieb   Judicial Clerks   Seattle</TEXT></DOC>
