(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Codenoll Technology Corp. with the Packard Electric Division of GeneralMotors Tuesday announced a complete line of 10 Mbps Ethernet LAN systems,components and a structured cabling system for Plastic Optical Fiber (POF).andM;This revolutionary new LAN media satsifies workgroup LAN needs immediatelyand resolves concerns about future data speeds.andM;Announced was a complete line of network products to connect PCs,minicomputers, terminal servers and PCs into an Ethernet workgroup networkusing low cost, easy to use plastic fiber.andM;The family of CodeNet POF products include: integrated network interfaces forISA, EISA and Micro Channel PC platforms; a POF Ethernet transceiver, thatprovides network connection for any type of device; a POF module for theCodenoll MultiStar or 3Com MultiConnect active hub; connectors for POF; wallplates; patch panels and a variety of preassembled cables.andM;The plastic optical networks introduced by Codenoll are configured in a starconfiguration and use the same signalling conventions as the IEEE FOIRL(Fiber Optic Inter-Repeater Link) Ethernet standard.andP;  Networks configuredusing the current CodeNet design can be more than 100 meters apart or 50meters from the POF concentrator.andM;Codenoll and Packard Electric also uveiled a complete structured cabling andconnector system for Plastic Optical Fiber.andP;  Based upon a patented design,the connector makes POF easier to use and install than any other type of LANwiring, including unshielded twisted pair (UTP).andM;POF connectors can be installed in less than a minute with simple andinexpensive hand-held tools.andP;  Once installed, the POF connectors are expectedto be more durable, reliable and trouble-free than any other form of LANconnector.andM;The connector and cabling system includes: the basic POF connector; POF walloutlets; a 19 inch POF patch panel, a receptacle with integrated optical LEDand detector for use on network adapters and concentrators; jump cables forthe connection from the user's computer and the wall outlet; andprefabricated patch cables for use in the wiring closet.andM;The price of the connectors is directly competitive with twisted pairconnectors.andP;  The duplex POF connector is retail priced at $1.95.andP;  Comparableconnectors such as the FDDI duplex fiber connector lists at approximately$34.00; Token Ring data connectors for twisted pair which list forapproximately $7.95; simplex glass fiber optic fiber connectors which listfrom $10-$15 each; and RJ45 Telco connectors which list from $1.00 to $1.95each.andM;Codenoll and Packard Electric have jointly developed this POF technology overthe past six years.andM;Plastic fiber as a LAN media has been designed to obsolete both coax andtwisted pair wiring.andP;  It is less expensive, easier to install and easier totest than either shielded or unshielded twisted pair, while providing thehigher performance and relability associated with fiber optics.andM;The increasing use of 386 and more powerful machines for graphics and imageprocessing coupled with the increased growth of the networking of computersis creating a need to share information at high network speeds.andM;Only fiber optic technology with its inherently high data rates addressesthese needs now and in the future.andP;  The same plastic optical fiber cable usedfor the Ethernet products can be used to run higher performance LANs such asFDDI (100 Mbps) and the new Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), at speeds of 100Mbps and 300 Mbps.andM;POF shares the inherent performance, reliability and flexibility advantagesof fiber optic networks: There can be no shorts, static buildup or groundloops in a fiber optic network; light transmission is immune toElectromagnetic Interference (EMI) and can be installed near copy machines,X-ray units and elevator shafts.andM;&quot;Fiber networks are the only choice where security or reliability arefactors,&quot; said GM and Codenoll officialsandM;&quot;POF will do for FDDI what twisted pair did for Ethernet -- make it costeffective for every desktop,&quot; said Michael H. Coden, president of Codenoll.andO;&quot;Put in plastic fiber and CodeNet POF Ethernet today and upgrade to POF FDDItomorrow without changing cable.andP;  Plastic Optical Fiber networks are now themost cost effective network option for workgroups and have the capacity totransmit data at 10 Megabits per second, 100 Megabits, 300 or more, as thisnetwork technology is introduced.andM;&quot;Only optical fiber offers that.andP;  And for longer distances, glass fiber willprovide backbones, inter-building and other connections required by largeenterprise-wide LANs.&quot;andM;Bill Collins, Packard Electric's manager of Specialty Products, commented onthe effort and design behind the POF connector.andP;  &quot;Our goal was to make thePOF connector as easy to use and install as the RJ45 telephone connector andwe were successful.andM;&quot;Anyone who can install a telephone or change an auto fuse can understand andimmediately use our POF connectors.andP;  We looked at all current LAN connectorsand requirements and designed a simple, snap-in, duplex plastic connectorwith several unique features.andM;&quot;First, it is practically indestructible, just like the plastic fiber ituses.andP;  The connector is polarized and can only be inserted the `right' wayinto the wall outlet or into network adapter in the computer.andP;  Once inserted,the connector locks into place and cannot be accidentally dislodged.andM;&quot;Also included is a shroud and molded strain relief connector to protect thefiber.andP;  Best of all, these features are available at a price competitive withany twisted pair connector.&quot;andM;&quot;We expect the POF connector and cable components to become a standard,&quot; saidBrian Ramsey, Codenoll's director of marketing.andM;&quot;We are committed to making the connectors, ICs and opto-electronic partsavailable to other vendors to accelerate the adoption of the POF medium inthe LAN market.&quot;andP;  Codenoll will begin marketing the connector system to othermanufacturers and distributors immediately.andM;Jack Olin, director of Advanced Engineering for Packard Electronics,indicated that &quot;Plastic Optical Fiber has been available for several years.andO;It is now available in all of the forms needed for a strategic buildingwiring system, and it is made by a number of companies such as: MitsubishiRayon, Optectron, Toray, and Asahi Chemical.andM;&quot;For LAN applications we use a duplex, or two fiber package.andP;  The light istransmitted within the PMMA (the same material used in plexiglass) core ofthe fiber, which is 1000 microns, or 1 mm thick.andP;  The fiber is protected by aPVC or plenum-rated jacket just like twisted pair,&quot; he continued.andP;  &quot;Plasticfiber is virtually indestructible -- you just can't break it.andP;  Even if youtry to crush or pinch it, it just springs right back to its original form,its far more flexible and durable than most twisted pair copper wire.&quot;andM;Codenoll said that the cost of Plastic Optical Fiber will be between 10 centsand 25 cents per foot, depending upon the jacket type and the quantitypurchased.andP;  &quot;As this type of media becomes more widely used, we expect theprice to stabilize below 10 cents,&quot; said Coden.andP;  &quot;POF is easier and lessrisky to install than the confusing variety of twisted pair wire that isrequired by different types of networks.&quot;andM;Codenoll expects to ship POF network products in January 1991.andP;  The retailprice of the CodeNet Network Interface cards start at $495, and $395 is theretail price of the POF transceiver.andP;  The POF module for the CodenollMultiStar active hub is priced at $495.andP;  The price of the POF connector isbelow one dollar in large quantity lots.andM;Packard Electric Divsion, a member of GM's automotive component group, is theworld's leader in automobile power and signal distribution systems.andP;  Packardsupplies complete wiring systems for over 9.5 million vehicles annually, is asupplier of systems and components to 15 of the top automotive manufacturers,and has over 9,000 total customers.andM;Packard's worldwide capabilities include 55,000 employees, eight engineeringsupport centers and 124 manufacturing facilities in 20 countries on sixcontinents.andM;Codenoll Technology Corp. is the leading supplier of fiber optic Ethernetcomputer network systems with thousands of installations worldwide.andP;  In 1989,the company announced two lines of FDDI high speed computer network productsunder its CodeNet trade name.andM;Codenoll products are resold worldwide by companies such as: Bosch, Bull, Candamp;PTelephone, Contel, Digital Equipment Corp., Pioneer Standard Electronics,Eurolan, Southwestern Bell, 3Com and hundreds of other VARs, SystemIntegrators and OEMs.andM;GM AND CODENOLL DEVELOPING PLASTIC OPTIC LANSandM;Price and Availability of Announced ProductsandM;CodeNet 8631           POF ISA Ethernet NIC         $  495    Q1andM;CodeNet 8621           POF Micro Channel NIC        $  795    Q1andM;CodeNet 8601           POF EISA Ethernet NIC        $ 1295    Q1andM;CodeNet 8681           POF Ethernet Transceiver     $  395    Q1andM;CodeNet 8611           POF MultiStar ConcentratorandM;Module                      $  495    Q1andM;CN CWS-POF             Duplex POF ConnectorandM;w/shroud                   $ 1.95    Q1andM;CN CNS-POF             Duplex POF ConnectorandM;no shroud                  $ 1.95    Q1andM;CN WO-POF              Duplex POF Wall Outlet       $ 4.95    Q1andM;CN CSR-POF             Cable Strain Relief Sleeve   $ 1.75    Q1andM;CN 2M-1000-POF         2 Meter Preassembled DropandM;Cable                      $24.50    Q1andM;CN 5M-1000-POF         5 Meter Preassembled DropandM;Cable                      $37.50    Q1andM;CN 1M-1000-POF         1 Meter Preassembled PatchandM;Cable                      $19.50andM;CN PP-POF              24 Connector 19 inch PatchandM;Panel                     $  175    Q1</TEXT></DOC>
