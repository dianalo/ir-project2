A federal takeover of the cleanup operation is one option thatwill be considered, the president told reporters at an Oval Officemeeting with Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, EnvironmentalProtection Agency Administrator Bill Reilly and Coast GuardCommandant Paul Yost.   Bush said he would asked the three ``to go up to Alaska to takea hard look at where this disaster stands.'' They were leavingimmediately after the White House.   ``I think it's important these top officials, federal officials,go there and then they will report to me after they've had a chanceto assess the situation on the ground,'' the president said.   Bush said the spillage of 11 million gallons of oil from thetanker Exxon Valdez, the largest oil spill in U.S. history, was ``amatter of tremendous concern to Alaskans and to all of us.''   Asked whether Exxon, which is overseeing the cleanup effort, wasdoing enough and if he was satisfied with the pace of the effort,he said:   ``They're certainly making a good beginning here, but there aresome conflicting reports on that. I don't want to prejudge that. Ithink one of the things that we're interested in hearing is exactlyhow our top officials feel the cleanup is going.''   A federal takeover of the operation is ``an option,'' Bush said.``And then the question is: is that the most prudent way to go. Andthat's one of the recommendations I'll be awaiting.''   Both Bush and Skinner hinted that Exxon might face big civilpenalties.   ``There are a variety of legal options that are available. Butnow the primary consideration is to make sure everything possibleis being done,'' Skinner said.   ``And the president has directed us to assess that, that oil isbeing contained and that the oil that remains on the tanker isbeing offloaded as quick as possible. That is our primary objectiveas mandated by the president. We'll then later on worry about whois going to pay for the damage.''   Bush said, ``the thing is to get it cleaned up, to protect thevery precious environment out there, to make sure everything isbeing done to clean up this disaster. And then we'll have all thesepenalties and all that later on.''   Bush said he still supports a proposal to open a pristine arcticwildlife refuge to oil drilling faces more intense scrutiny afterthe spill of millions of gallons of oil into environmentallysensitive waters off the Alaska coast.   ``There's no connection'' between that and the oil spill, hesaid.   Bush has endorsed what he calls ``environmentally prudent'' oilexploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an expanse ofwilderness that is home to caribou, polar bears and a variety ofwaterfowl in the northeastern reaches of Alaska.   But some members of Congress, which must approve opening therefuge for drilling, said Monday the oil tanker spill in Alaska'sPrince William Sound _ the worst such spill in U.S. history _raises questions about whether environmental safeguards can beassured.   It's too early to tell whether the controversy over the spillwill dash the oil industry's hopes for quick passage this year oflegislation allowing drilling in the refuge. Such a bill earlierthis month cleared the Senate Energy and Natural ResourcesCommittee.   The American Petroleum Institute, the oil companies' Washingtonlobbying group, called the spill ``very regrettable'' and saidsimply: ``We cannot tell what impact it might have on pendingpetroleum industry issues here in Washington.''   At a news conference today, 11 major environmental groupsblasted the oil industry for breaking promises of assuring thatenvironmental accidents such as the spill in Alaska would notoccur, or if they happen would be quickly cleaned up.   ``The great accident they said wouldn't happen has nowhappened,'' said Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club.   Brock Evans of the National Audubon Society said, ``We've hadenough of oil industry promises. They can't be kept.''   Other speakers from the environmental movement ridiculedsuggestions that the Exxon Valdez tanker spill is an isolatedaccident. They cited other tanker spills in recent years, althoughof a much lesser magnitude, still harmful to the environment.   ``The term environmentally safe oil development is acontradiction,'' said Lisa Spear of the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil.   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate environmentalprotection subcommittee, said Monday the spill ``is the latest andmost tragic evidence of the gap that exists between past industryassurances and actual industry performance in preventingenvironmental damage.''   Another member of the environmental panel, Sen. JosephLieberman, D-Conn., suggested that the spill and the problemscontaining it ``graphically refute those who maintain that the oilindustry in Alaska does not harm the environment.''   Meanwhile, a House Interior subcommittee with jurisdiction overAlaska oil drilling plans hearings into the spill and itssignificance for opening the Alaska refuge to oil exploration.   ``Obviously the tanker spill and the inadequacy of the cleanupeffort could have serious implications for the expansion of NorthSlope oil development,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.,chairman of the Interior subcommittee on water, power and offshoreenergy resources.   Oil companies and the environmental movement have been facingoff over exploratory drilling in the Alaska wildlife refuge forseveral years since preliminary indications raised the prospect offinding more than 3 billion barrels of crude under the region'stundra.   Bills opening the refuge for drilling are under consideration inboth the House and Senate. Legislation also has been introduced todeclare the refuge a formal wilderness area, which would prohibitoil or gas development.   The oil industry wants exploratory drilling along a 1.5million-acre coastal stretch of the refuge which also is thebreeding ground for North America's largest remaining herd ofmigratory caribou and the habitat for polar bears, musk oxen,wolves, arctic foxes and an assortment of waterfowl.</TEXT></DOC>
