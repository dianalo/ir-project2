Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in a letter to bereavedfamilies, urged them to carry on the struggle to defend the nation.   ``I know that your nights are filled with nightmares and yourdays lack the pleasures of life,'' he wrote. ``Still, I'm askingyou to persist for the sake of yourselves, your sons and daughterswho are no longer with us and, most of all, for futuregenerations.''   The siren brought Israel to a standstill Monday night.Pedestrians and motorists stopped in silent tribute. Restaurantsand movie theaters were closed and radios broadcast solemn music.   Memorial Day officially began when President Chaim Herzog lit atorch at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, in the walledOld City.   ``On this day, we remember that we have paid the price of fallensoldiers, of blood and suffering for the state of Israel,'' hesaid. ``Let this memory be an order of unity for us, an order tohate war and love peace. Let God give courage to His people. LetGod bless His people with peace.''   A two-minute siren Tuesday marks the beginning of services in 40military cemeteries and at the 50 monuments to fallen soldiers.   The 24-hour mourning period will end with a ceremony at theMount Herzl cemetery in Jerusalem, burial place of many of Israel'ssoldiers and founding fathers. This also marks the start ofIsrael's 41st Independence Day celebrations.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, speaking at a ceremony inJerusalem, focused on the Palestinian uprising in the occupiedterritories, saying that ``Arab terrorism has reached new heightsof violence and murderousness against the Israeli people thisyear.''   He said that ``courage, self-sacrifice and devotion'' of fallensoldiers encouraged Israeli troops ``to repel the stone-throwers,the firebombers... the mad murderers led by their hate of theJews.''   To prevent possible Palestinian attacks over the holidays, thearmy sealed off the occupied West Bank for 53 hours, beginningMonday evening. The order barred all of the area's nearly 1 millionPalestinians from traveling to Israel.   About 700,000 Palestinians living in the occupied Gaza Stripwere placed under an indefinite army curfew.   Leaders of the Palestinian uprising called a general strike forTuesday to mark the beginning of the revolt's 18th month.   At least seven Israeli soldiers have died in the conflict, aswell as 14 Israeli civilians and 465 Palestinians.   The latest victim was Sgt. Avi Sassportaz, 21, whose body wasfound Sunday a mile from the road junction where he was last seennearly three months ago trying to hitchhike home. Israeli officialssaid Sassportaz was shot by Palestinian guerrillas.   In Sassportaz's hometown of Ashdod, thousands turned out for hisfuneral. Mourners later poured onto a main road and stonedArab-owned cars, and police arrested dozens of protesters,witnesses said.   ``The last year has not been good for us, and we paid a high, apainful price,'' Rabin said in his letter.   The army says 16,740 soldiers have died in Israel's five warsand in guerrilla attacks, including 785 in the 1967 Middle East warin which Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza. In Israel's lastwar, the 1982 invasion of Lebanon and three-year occupation, 1,183soldiers lost their lives.</TEXT></DOC>
