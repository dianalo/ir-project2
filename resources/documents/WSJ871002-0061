Further talks aren't planned between the government-owned agency and the union, which represents 23,000 postal clerks, mail sorters, and other inside workers.    Harold Dunstan, labor-relations manager for Canada Post, said yesterday that the agency's proposal last Saturday was a &quot;final offer.&quot; He said the union proposals showed &quot;no serious movement&quot; on the issue of job security.    In the second day of rotating strikes, more than 600 workers walked off the job in Halifax, Nova Scotia; St. John's, Newfoundland; and Hamilton, Ontario. More than 3,000 workers in Montreal continued an unauthorized, general walkout, defying the union leadership. Canada Post said it was staffing those facilities with temporary workers.    A senior government official continued to meet with both sides, to determine whether a negotiated settlement was possible. Federal Labor Minister Pierre Cadieux has said back-to-work legislation is a possibility if mail service is seriously disrupted.    The union opposes Canada Post's plans to franchise some stamp sales and similar operations to private enterprise, saying it would result in the loss of 4,200 positions.    A conciliator's report has supported the agency's right to sell franchises, as long as existing-employees jobs are protected. The report said labor costs using retail outlets would be about 13% to 20% of revenue, compared with 70% of revenue using Canada Post unionized employees, who are paid an average wage of 13.42 Canadian dollars ($10.25) an hour.    Canada Post is trying to reduce costs so that it will be financially self-sufficient by March 31, as mandated by law. Canada Post has said it will meet its $30 million deficit target in the current fiscal year, narrowing from an estimated $132 million last year. </TEXT></DOC>
