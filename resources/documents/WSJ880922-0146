Nun, poet, musician, painter, errant theologian, embodied metaphor, living conceit, beauty in a wimple, syllogism in a gown, a creature doubly to be feared: her voice enchants, her arguments kill.&quot; In such occasional bursts of hyperbole, Octavio Paz extols an extraordinary Mexican woman of the 17th century, Juana Ramirez de Abasje, remembered in literature as Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, well known in what was then called &quot;New Spain,&quot; and also in old Spain. Mr. Paz and others regard her as a major poet in the baroque style.    In a poem, Sor Juana says: &quot;I was born where solar rays/stared down at me from overhead,/not squint-eyed, as in other climes.&quot; Mr. Paz identifies her birthplace as San Miguel Nepantla, &quot;a village in the foothills of Popocatepetl.&quot; The year was 1648.    An extensive multilingual literature about her has existed since her day. Yet our century, notably this decade, brings Sor Juana into her own in several ways. She has been neglected in English. Two current books from Harvard University Press rectify that. One is a massive critical/historical biography, &quot;Sor Juana: Or, the Traps of Faith&quot; (560 pages, $29.95) by Octavio Paz, translated by Margaret Sayers Peden. Its companion is the slender book, &quot;A Sor Juana Anthology&quot; (272 pages, $29.50), translated by Alan S. Trueblood, with a foreword by Octavio Paz.    Mr. Paz, looked upon by many as dean of current Latin American writers, is Sor Juana's most recent and comprehensive biographer. An immense, loving labor of critical/scholarly skills is poured into the study of this remarkable woman, who will be a discovery to many readers, as she was to me. The book will stand as an important achievement of this prolific, versatile poet/critic/scholar.    The biography appeared in Spanish in 1982. It is finely written, as judged by Ms. Peden's translation, which must have had the author's scrutiny and approval. Yet it is formidably heavy in content, ironically burdened by the scope of Mr. Paz's abilities. Not simply the story of Sor Juana's life (which alone would be enthralling), it also is a concise historical analysis of the society and politics of &quot;New Spain&quot; -- Mexico from the conquest until 1821, when it ceased to be a viceregal satrapy of Old Spain.    There always has been controversy about Sor Juana's actual relations with the church. She wrote extensively on these problems, as did many churchmen of her time, and since. Some Catholic spokesmen have seen her as a figure of devout piety, in spite of strongly erotic imagery in much of her poetry. Mr. Paz disagrees, approaching the subject from the position of classical anti-clericalism, though with great knowledge of the ecclesiastical/theological niceties involved.    He is so determined to tell us all he knows about every aspect of the material that we are overwhelmed. As pure scholarship this is not only defensible but admirable. Yet it is an impediment to general readers whose interests may range from &quot;women's studies&quot; to Latin American history and literature in general, or to those who simply love to read about the lives of remarkable persons.    Juana Ramirez was illegitimate, yet her reputable, if eccentric, family connections were sufficient to place her in the viceregal court at 15. Attractive, self-educated through precocious poring over of her grandfather's library, she became a favorite at court and began her writing of poetry. Yet at 20, she took the veil in the convent of San Jeronimo (St. Jerome).    Had she a deep religious vocation? No, thinks Mr. Paz, although she was fully part of her Catholic culture. She did not have the legitimate lineage, or the dowry, to make a worldly marriage appropriate to her qualities. The convent was a haven. Mr. Paz considers that Sor Juana's truly compelling love was for learning. &quot;. . . in 1669 the convent seemed to be the solution; if her destiny was learning, she could not be learned in the lay world either married or single. She could, on the other hand, be learned as a nun.&quot; Also, she managed ably the intricate financial affairs of the convent. Her &quot;cell&quot; was an apartment of two stories, containing her own library and her collection of musical and scientific instruments. Her copious work -- poetry, plays, prose -- circulated widely.    Then, in the early 1690s, she was trapped, in Mr. Paz's view, in a clash between high ecclesiastical powers. She was pressed to desist from secular writing and even challenged on subtle theological issues. One of the documents of the case, her long &quot;Letter of Justification in Reply to an Admonishment,&quot; is included in the &quot;Sor Juana Anthology.&quot;    In 1694 she &quot;abjured&quot; her &quot;Humane Studies&quot; and works. In 1695, she died, at 46, in an epidemic through which she nursed her sisters. Some Catholic writers, mostly of an earlier period, called her abjuration a &quot;conversion.&quot; Mr. Paz calls it, especially because of its self-abasing rhetoric, &quot;an act of submission to proud prelates&quot; and compares it with Bukharin's political &quot;confession&quot; in the Stalinist trials.    Enigmas remain in this complex tragedy. Mr. Paz certainly is right that: &quot;She fascinates us because the most extreme opposites come together in her without ever completely blending . . . this is the secret of her compelling vitality: few beings are as alive as she -- after being buried for centuries.&quot;    ---   Mr. Fuller, now retired, was the Journal's senior book critic. </TEXT></DOC>
