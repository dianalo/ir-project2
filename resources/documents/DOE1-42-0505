SCE are establishedby including a macromolecular additive, which strongly interacts withthe field, in the carrier. A theoretical evaluation of SCE-FFF for smallsolutes is presented. The effects of field strength, additive concentration,solute-additive binding, and the interaction of the additive with theexternal field are evaluated.</TEXT></DOC>
