The sponsor of the field trial isthe Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Prior to the issuance of the environmental assessment and the preliminaryfinding of no significant impact (hereinafter ``the document'') the documentwas reviewed by APHIS' Veterinary Biologics Biotechnology Committee, aninteragency advisory group. This interagency group includes select expertsfrom the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service,the Food Safety and Inspection Service, the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService's National Veterinary Services Laboratories, the Food and DrugAdministration, and the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities at the NationalInstitutes of Health. Because of the special scientific issues raised bythis request for field testing, the document was also reviewed by the NationalVaccine Program Interagency Group of the Public Health Service, which includesmembers from the Centers for Disease Control.At the request of an animal rights/environmental interest organizationAPHIS is convening a public meeting of experts from the interagency committeethat reviewed the document. The purpose of the meeting is to provide aforum in which the public may participate, in an open discussion of theissues raised in the document. APHIS is considering convening a separatepublic meeting in the future for the purpose of discussing the broaderissue of use of vaccinia as a vector for veterinary biological products.<ITAG tagnum="84">Procedures for public meeting</ITAG>The meeting will begin at 10:00 a.m., and is scheduled to end at 4:30 p.m.,local time. However, the meeting may end earlier if the expert panel hasconcluded its discussion and all persons who are present and who have requestedan opportunity to speak have been heard. Persons who wish to deliver astatement that has been prepared in advance of the meeting, should registerat the meeting location with the presiding officer, before the meeting.Pre-meeting registration will be conducted at the meeting location from9:30 a.m., to 10:00 a.m., local time, on the meeting date. Registered personswill be heard in the order of their registration. However, other personswho wish to speak at the meeting will be afforded the opportunity afterthe registered persons have been heard. It is requested that two copiesof any written statements that are presented be provided to the presidingofficer at the meeting. If the number of preregistered persons and otherparticipants at the meeting warrants, the presiding officer may limit thetime for each presentation in order to allow everyone wishing to speakan opportunity to be heard. Interested persons may appear and be heardin person, or by attorney or by other representative.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment and Preliminary Finding of No SignificantImpact</ITAG>Before a veterinary biological product can be licensed under the Virus-Serum-ToxinAct (VSTA) (21 U.S.C. 151 <T3>et seq.</T3>), it must be shown to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious.Field testing is necessary in order to satisfy vaccine safety requirementsas a prerequisite to licensing vaccines under the VSTA. In the course ofreviewing the field testing protocol for the vaccinia vectored rabies vaccine,APHIS assessed the impact on the human environment of authorizing the sponsorto conduct a limited field test of the product on three offshore islands,one off the coast of Virginia and two off the coast of South Carolina.The environmental assessment and preliminary finding of no significantimpact provide the public with documentation of APHIS' review and analysisof environmental effects which would be associated with the gathering ofinformation in this limited field trial.The facts that support a preliminary finding of no significant impact aresummarized below and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. Genetic engineering procedures were employed to incorporate only therabies glycoprotein gene within the Thymidine Kinase (TK) locus of vacciniavirus. The recombinant vaccine virus cannot induce rabies.2. The vaccinia rabies glycoprotein (V-RG) recombinant vaccine has beenshown to cause no adverse clinical signs or gross or histopathologicallesions, yet is fully capable of eliciting an immune response that protectsa variety of species from virulent rabies virus challenge. Although viruswas isolated from tissues in two of ten immune deficient mice, this isnot considered significant under the conditions of this field trial. TheV-RG recombinant virus is unable to evoke antibodies to the remaining rabiesviral structural proteins. This allows differentiation between unvaccinatedrabies-exposed animals and vaccinated animals.3. Biological transmission of the V-RG recombinant virus cold not be demonstratedwith rodents, foxes, cats, swine, cattle, ferrets or badgers in that rabiesvirus neutralizing antibody was not elicited from sentinel animals whichwere held as nonvaccinated contact controls. All control animals remainedfully susceptible to challenge with wild-type rabies virus. Contact transmission(mechanical) of the V-RG recombinant virus was observed between two offive vaccinated male-female paired raccoons, a vaccinated lactating femaleraccoon and her kits, and between two foxes when an orally vaccinated foximmediately bit its cage mate.4. The TK gene inserting is a stable characteristic of the V-RG recombinantvirus vaccine with a probability of loss or reversion being low.5. The V-RG recombinant virus does not contain an oncogene or cancer causingsubstance. The recombinant-derived virus does not contain any new geneticinformation to enhance the likelihood of it being oncogenic.6. In the proposed field trial, deliberate human exposure would be limitedto individuals protected against vaccinia in accordance with Public HealthService guidelines.7. Laboratory containment experiments demonstrate that the vaccine is non-pathogenic,safe, and efficacious in a variety of laboratory animal model systems,e.g., mice, hamsters, rats, and a number of target and non-target species,including the major terrestrial wildlife reservoirs of rabies and domesticanimal species.Based on the foregoing, APHIS has made a preliminary determination thatthe field testing of the vaccinia vectored rabies vaccine that expressesthe rabies virus surface glycoprotein would have no significant impacton the human environment.The environmental assessment and preliminary finding of no significantimpact have been prepared in accordance with (1) The National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508); (3) USDA regulations implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS guidelines implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 1st day of March 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
