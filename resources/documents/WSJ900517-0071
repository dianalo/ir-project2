Today, at 32, she is single again,supporting herself and three children on a $250 monthlysalary, plus welfare payments and foodstamps. Her electricbill hasn't been paid in months, and her six-year-old son,Brandon, can wiggle his toes through his torn blue sneakers.To deal with the stress, she chain-smokes Winston 100s andgulps down instant coffee.   Yet for many of her fellow women here without a man in thehousehold, Ms. Sulfridge is a role model. She works part-timeas a social-service counselor.</LP><TEXT>   On the job one day recently, she is sitting beside a coalstove in a blue shack tucked deep among the pines off RedBird Road, visiting a 16-year-old girl who has threatened torun away. The girl, smoking cigarettes and combing knots fromher blond hair, talks of her school troubles and her fearsthat her stepfather, who once dragged her by the hair acrossthe living room floor, may return to the house and beat her.   Ms. Sulfridge comforts her and urges her to stay inschool. &quot;Read everything you can find,&quot; she says. And, shepleads: &quot;Be a child before you have a child.&quot; As the sunslips behind the Cumberland Mountains, Ms. Sulfridge climbsinto her rusty 1982 Pontiac Phoenix, frustrated that shecan't do more for the girl. &quot;If these kids give up,&quot; shesays, &quot;we've lost the battle.&quot;   Long the heart and soul of Appalachia, women like PatSulfridge are becoming its backbone too. Here in WhitleyCounty, which is mostly white, nearly one in three householdsis headed by a woman. That is double the national average,and fast approaching the proportion of the nation's blackfamilies that are headed by women -- 44%.   When Ms. Sulfridge checks in at the food-stamp office forher monthly rations, only women join her in line. At theWal-Mart, about the only men she sees are a few retireeswaiting for prescriptions. &quot;It's the mamas who are fightingfor their families,&quot; she says. &quot;Surely to goodness, there aresome good men in this county, but I don't know where theyare.&quot;   Carol M. Straus, a University of Kentucky researcher whohas studied Kentucky women in poverty, says, &quot;It's becomingless and less likely that an Appalachian woman can rely on aman for support of herself and children.&quot; The same holds truein poorer places elsewhere in the country. Says SylviaHewlett, a New York economist: &quot;The inner-city model hasmoved into white, blue-collar communities. If you're a25-year-old white woman, you have a 40% chance of being asingle mother.&quot;   Not that mountain women could ever depend on men for asteady income. Work in the region's coal mines, tobaccofields and logging camps was always erratic. But in theseremote hills and hollows, families hung together. The regionhas been physically and culturally isolated for generations.Even though highways now link mountain communities, thehollows remain off-limits to outsiders and their notions ofwomen's liberation. So generations of women have lived atraditional life, dropping out of school to marry and raise abrood of youngsters.   They depended on fathers, brothers and cousins, whousually lived close by, to help support them in hard times.They deferred to their husbands. At mealtimes, they fed themen first, and then the children. Wives often gulped theirown meals while clearing the dishes. &quot;Men had the right totell you when to go to bed and when to get up,&quot; says EdithParrett, a 59-year-old native of neighboring Clay County.&quot;Women have been second-class citizens.&quot;   The men have been leaving these parts for the big citiesof the Midwest or California, or simply to drift, at a fasterrate than their women. Virtually every local industry hasautomated or retrenched; employment in Kentucky coal mineshas dropped 40% to just 29,500 in the past decade. In WhitleyCounty, with a population of 35,600, there are only about1,200 manufacturing jobs, and even minimum-wage work infast-food restaurants or retail stores is scarce.   One of those who left was Ms. Sulfridge's husband.   The life she has led since is not what she expectedgrowing up as the sixth of nine children in a rural WhitleyCounty family. Her family lived on a tiny farm in a woodenshack without plumbing. But her parents stayed together. Theystill milk the cows together, and they celebrated their 46thwedding anniversary this year. &quot;They share the struggles,&quot;Ms. Sulfridge says.   Two of her siblings left Kentucky for work in Californiaand Michigan. The others remained to work in the mines. Ms.Sulfridge's childhood sweetheart was Reese Sulfridge, whoattended vocational school and talked of college and studyingarchitecture. She dropped out of the 10th grade to marry him.&quot;He seemed ambitious,&quot; she says.   Instead of going to college, Mr. Sulfridge tookconstruction jobs to support his bride and their first child,Patty. Several times they went to Michigan and Ohio to searchfor factory work but always were drawn back to Kentucky to beclose to family. By 1983, they had two more children, Shawndaand Brandon. In most years Mr. Sulfridge's seasonal workearned him less than $4,000. Ms. Sulfridge took part-timejobs cleaning houses and serving food at Pizza Hut.   In their best year, Mr. Sulfridge earned about $10,000 atthe Williamsburg water plant. &quot;We felt rich,&quot; Ms. Sulfridgesays. But the job didn't last. Mr. Sulfridge, unemployed,went &quot;bowling, fishing and hunting,&quot; she says. Then, shesays, the drinking and arguing began. Once they separatedwhen, she says, he told her she couldn't spend $25 to buyPatty a blue-jean jacket. &quot;Every $1.25 he laid up on a barcould've helped buy a pair of shoes for the kids,&quot; she says.&quot;To think I once dreamed of growing old and sitting inrocking chairs together.&quot;   About 18 months ago, the couple divorced. Since then Ms.Sulfridge has received just $80 in child-support payments. InKentucky, only $2.68 in support payments is collected forevery $1 spent to track missing fathers, according to theU.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. Sulfridge,one of those who is often missing, couldn't be reached forcomment. Ms. Sulfridge says he has dropped by to visit fromtime to time, but she doesn't know where he lives.   Ms. Sulfridge was forced to move to cheaper quartersseveral times in the past 18 months. She has lived in acramped trailer and a dilapidated house so leaky that snowfell on her face as she slept. She recently found a modern,three-bedroom house with a front yard where two puppies canrun with the kids. The rent is cheap because the house isabout a dozen miles away from the nearest town. Ms. Sulfridgeis redecorating one bedroom by covering a wall with a roll ofnavy and pink flowered wallpaper purchased for $1.   A tall, thin woman who looks older than she is, Ms.Sulfridge shops at yard sales and shares pairs of second-handblue jeans with Patty, now 17 years old. Walking through aWal-Mart one recent morning, Ms. Sulfridge finds that herbudget allows only one purchase: a $1.77 container of roll-ondeodorant. When she spots a penny in the parking lot, shepicks it up and pockets it. &quot;I need all the luck I can get.&quot;   Since her husband left, she has taken odd jobs. She hasscrubbed floors and stood in cold barns for 12-hour shifts,stripping tobacco. &quot;I'll beg, borrow or steal to take care ofmy kids,&quot; she says.   What's sustaining her now is a community of other singlemothers. With so few men left in the region, she doesn'texpect to remarry -- nor does she especially want to. But shehas found help and an extended family at the Whitley CountyCommunities for Children, a woman-run, grant-supported groupthat offers training in such diverse areas as raisinglivestock, counseling teen-agers and running computers.   Ms. Sulfridge first went there for tutoring for ahigh-school equivalency degree. Then she was hired as apart-time counselor. Several days a week, she and othersingle mothers travel the dirt roads of Whitley County,visiting girls like the teenager living in the blue shack.   &quot;I probably wouldn't have made it if not for these peoplehere,&quot; she says.   At lunch, one woman prepares a salad in a large bowl tofeed a score of volunteers and staff. Near the kitchen, adozen toddlers play as mothers take turns providing daycare.A loom in the corner of the room displays a half-finishedblue rug, which will soon be sold to raise funds for thecenter.   After lunch, several women pile into Ms. Sulfridge's usedPontiac to locate teenagers who might want after-schooltutoring. She and her friends depend on her car because thereis no public transportation in the region. The drive to adoctor's office or job is often 30 miles or more. The womenchip in for gasoline. Some have never learned to drivebecause their husbands never let them.   Driving through the rugged countryside, they pass woodenshacks with chickens darting through littered yards filledwith empty milk cartons and other garbage. &quot;That white houseover there is where a grandmother is raising her 25grandchildren,&quot; says a passenger in the car. &quot;And abootlegger lives over there,&quot; she whispers. Whitley County islegally dry.   Thin plastic rather than glass covers the windows of manyhomes. &quot;I'm poor and I've had a hard time,&quot; Ms. Sulfridgesays. &quot;But there are kids living here who've never even had a$3 Happy Meal at McDonald's.&quot;   The women can't find the teen-agers who had asked them tovisit, and turn back toward home. On the way, they stop forCokes and other small purchases, paying with food stamps.After dropping each of her passengers off, Ms. Sulfridgehurries to pick up her three children at school. They getnervous when she is late. Since her husband left, her sonBrandon often wakes up at night yelling, &quot;Where's Mom?&quot;   &quot;These kids hang on to me like a leech,&quot; Ms. Sulfridgesays. &quot;I can't start to the store without them asking, `Whereare you going and when will you be back?'&quot;   Sandwiches make tonight's dinner. Afterward the table isclear and dishes promptly washed. Seventeen-year-old Pattyworks quietly at the table, rewriting stories for herhigh-school yearbook. She will graduate with an A averagethis month and hopes to win a scholarship for college.   Patty has never worn a new dress to a prom, and shedoesn't expect one for graduation, either. But she would liketo send out graduation announcements, and asks her mother ifthere is any money. Ms. Sulfridge silently studies the orderform. Then Shawnda asks her mother how to dress for her roleas Mother Mouse in a school play, and Brandon brings out thecoloring books and crayons. He mischievously shows a visitorhow to pick the bathroom lock with a pocket knife. &quot;My Dadgave me this,&quot; he brags.   At 11 p.m., after the children have gone to bed, Ms.Sulfridge tackles a heap of laundry and talks of her hopesfor her children. &quot;I hope they get an education and dosomething with their lives,&quot; she says. Then, she says, shehopes to go to college herself and become a nurse. She alsoconfides that she has stashed away a few dollars to orderPatty's graduation announcements. &quot;Some things,&quot; she says,&quot;are too important to do without.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
