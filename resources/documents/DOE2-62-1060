Such modelsare interesting because they go to the roots of concurrency - the circuitlevel. A problem with the models is that it is unclear how to programlarge systems and expensive to implement many features that are takenfor granted in symbolic programming languages. This paper describes theConcurrent Inference System (CIS), and its implementation on a massivelyconcurrent network model of computation. It shows how much of the functionalityof current rule-based systems can be implemented in a straightforwardmanner within such models. Unlike conventional implementations of rule-basedsystems in which the inference engine and rule sets are clearly dividedat run time, CIS compiles the rules into a large static concurrent networkof very simple devices. In this network the rules and inference engineare no longer distinct. The thinking Machines Corporation, ConnectionMachine - a 65,536 processor SIMD computer - is then used to run thenetwork. On the current implementation, real time user system interactionis possible with up to 100,000 rules.</TEXT></DOC>
