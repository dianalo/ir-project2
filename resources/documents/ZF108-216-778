 That's what teachers and instructional materialsspecialists told us when we asked a selection of early adopters howvideodiscs were actually working out in their classrooms.andM;Thus far, the number of videodisc players configured for computer control(Level III configurations, in the usual industry taxonomy) in the schools isstill quite small, with most estimates centered in the low thousands.andO;According to the several distributors of courseware, stand-alone units arestill the most popular, followed by control with an Apple II, a PC and asmaller number of Macintoshes.andM;High FinanceandM;A large part of the problem is money.andP;  &quot;It's an expensive item,&quot; says JudyOnstad, a science teacher at Troy High School in Fullerton, Calif.andP;  She's inher fourth year of using videodiscs in the classroom.andM;As with all the other sites we spoke with, Onstad said her school probablywouldn't have purchased the player and computer out of the regular budget,but was able to do so with money from a technology grant.andP;  Along withregional and state grants, some sites reported donations from high-technologyfirms.andM;About half the sites started off with a single disc or set of videodiscs, butmost have subsequently purchased more.andP;  At up to $400 per disc, many schoolsalso have trouble fitting the videodisc &quot;software&quot; into the regular budget,so grant money was again the major source of funds.andP;  Only a few sites haveordered more than three different courses, and most only buy from one to fourcopies of each one.andM;However, as Gerry Montgomery, Project Director for the Monterey ModelTechnology Schools Project in California points out, a lot of the difficultymay be perceptual rather than strictly economic.andP;  Many other items in thecurriculum supplements budget are similar in cost, and the value receivedmakes many videodiscs a good buy.andM;Perhaps, she says, one answer might be to bundle videodiscs in with textbooksas complete packages.andP;  When considered in with the total cost of equipping aclassroom or grade level with textbooks, the added videodisc cost becomesmore bearable.andM;Supporting RoleandM;In contrast to industry, where complete course on videodisc are popular,videodiscs are still playing a secondary role in most schools.andP;  For themajority of sites we surveyed, videodiscs were being used primarily assupplements to more traditional courses, rather than as the focus.andP;  Ashistory teacher John Maunu of Grosse Ile High School in Grosse Ile, Mich.andO;explains, that means it's not enough to plunk down the videodisc system inthe classroom and let the students take turns.andP;  &quot;To make them an effectivelearning tool, you have to write good curriculum.&quot;andM;For example, reports Maunu, he recently assigned his classes a project makingextensive use of the ABC News Interactive Vote '88 interactive videodisc.andO;But instead of only studying the 1988 Bush election on disc, the studentscompared this recent election to the 1788 election of George Washington --which they researched using more traditional materials.andP;  That was more workfor Maunu than using either the traditional materials or the videodiscsalone, but he said felt it was worthwhile.andM;In fact, say some other teachers, the need to integrate the use of a discwith the rest of the curriculum means they can't always use the programs thatcome with the disc.andP;  Especially in classrooms with only one player, and wherevideo is used primarily as a presentation aid, a set program can get in theway.andP;  Several teachers have solved that problem by using the players inStandalone mode with a remote control even when they have a computeravailable.andM;Popular TechnologyandM;As a technology itself, the videodiscs and their players are popular withmost teachers.andP;  Most already had been using videotape, and had alreadydeveloped the basic infrastructure for supporting and using machines, screensand media.andP;  But with a disc, said Mary Ann Anderson, Principal, CenterElementary School in Elverta, Calif., &quot;it's easier to stop the video andintegrate the lesson into it.&quot;andM;In the younger grades, most teachers said they were mostly on their own whenlearning to use the equipment.andP;  In many high schools, though, students withcomputers and video equipment of their own often formed a supplementary poolof expertise.andM;Handle With CareandM;They're have been few problems with handling equipment, teachers reproted,but most pointed out the equipment is still very new.andP;  &quot;It's probably one ofthe most durable mediums on the market,&quot; says Monterey Unified's Montgomery.andO;&quot;We haven't had any problems with our laser players and we haven't had anyproblems with the Macintosh.&quot;andP;  She admits that at least one disc has beendropped at her school--&quot;but it just bounced.&quot;andM;Institutions that allow unsupervised use of the equipment were more cautious.andO;At the San Jose Public Library, there is an exhibit area with a completekiosk from IBM with the history of the U.S.andP;  Constitution and a Macintoshwith the ABC News Interactive Martin Luther King Jr.andP;  disc.andP;  According toSupervising Librarian Pat Curia, the closed kiosk works well for publicaccess, but they've deciced not to let patrons handle the disc on the Mac.andO;That means that users can only use one side of the two-sided disc in anysession--the staff periodically switches which of the two sides is madeavailable.andM;As far as institutional effectiveness of videodiscs, most teachers said itwas too early for any formal conclusions.andP;  Several of the grant programsinclude an educational effectiveness evaluation phase, but the studies haveyet to be completed.andP;  Most teachers said they have seen some benefits,primarily in terms of increased student interest.andM;Grosse Ile's John Maunu says he's noticed some unexpected side benefits aswell.andP;  The introduction of the new technology has meant that he has had tobecome a learner as well as his students.andM;&quot;You really get closer to the students,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;They understand that Idon't know everything, and we become learning partners.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
