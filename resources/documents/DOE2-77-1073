The effect was therefore studied of the technologicalsolution of converting the heat output of WWER-440 units to operatingparameters of turbines in nonrated regimes of operation. Some resultsof the study are graphically represented. An analysis was also made oflimitations preventing WWER-440 units from supplying heat with regardto their incorporation in the electric power transmission system. Theresults show that using nuclear power units for district heating willin the future strictly determine the seasonal shut-down of nuclear unitsfor fuel exchange and overhauls. This could interfere with the consideredconcept of the 1.5 year duty time of WWER-440 reactors. With regard tothe economy of operation of the nuclear power system and reduced demandson weekend unloading it will be necessary to incorporate in the powersystem pumped-storage power plants with one-week pumped-storage systems.(Z.M.). 5 figs., 2 tabs., 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
