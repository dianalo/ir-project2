Nearly complete results from Sunday's balloting gave the Greensa place in the 349-member Riksdag, or parliament, for the firsttime with 20 seats. However, the Greens were denied the key role asa legislative power broker.   Results today from all but a few mailed ballots, invalid returnsor votes for splinter parties showed the Social Democrats won 156parliament seats, or 43.6 percent _ a loss of three seats from the1985 elections.   The Communist party won 21 seats to finish fifth with 5.9percent of the vote, a gain of two. Although there is no formalagreement, the Communists tacitly support the Social Democrats andguarantee their ability to govern.   The conservative opposition Moderates, with 66 seats, or 17.9percent, finished a distant second.   The Liberals came in third with 44 seats, or 12.2 percent; nextcame the Center Party, with 42 seats, or 11.4 percent; theCommunists; and the Greens, with 5.5 percent. The ChristianDemocrats won no seats although they got 3 percent of the vote.   The Greens, the first new party to enter parliament in 70 years,drew most of their support from non-socialist opposition parties,which suffered their worst combined defeat since World War II.   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, who took office after the 1986assassination of Olof Palme, said, ``We have ridden out the stormand stood steady in the wind, and we have won.''   Carlsson admitted he had felt ``a bit nervous'' leading theSocial Democrats in an election for the first time.   Moderates leader Carl Bildt claimed the outcome showed hope forthe opposition and the beginning of a decline for the SocialDemocrats, which lost support in the big cities ``where politicalattitudes change faster.''   Pre-election polls incorrectly predicted the Communists wouldfail to win the 4 percent minimum for a seat in the unicameralchamber. Many people were believed to have voted for the SocialDemocrats to ensure the party's survival, resulting in what partyleader Lars Werner called its best election in 40 years.   The entry of the Greens will have little impact on the workingsof the Riksdag, but could prove disruptive in the future, somepolitical commentators said.   Voter turnout was 86.4 percent, the lowest in 28 years.   Swedish television, broadcasting the official results, saidabout 2 percent, slightly more than ususal, cast blank ballots orvoted for one of about 100 fringe parties as a protest vote.   According to pre-election surveys, about 10 percent of thevoters made up their minds in the last few days.   The Social Democrats, architects of Sweden's welfare state, hadbeen shaken by a series of mishaps earlier this year, including apolitically risky attempt to sponsor a private investigation intoPalme's unsolved murder. The popular justice minister, Anna-GretaLeijon, was forced to resign in June for overstepping her authorityin the affair.   Carlsson admitted the irregular probe and reports of illegalarms sales by Swedish companies had hurt the party. ``We would havedone better'' if not for the scandals, he said.   Carlsson targeted the final weeks of the campaign on managementof the economy at a time when business profits and wages were high,unemployment was reduced to 1.7 percent and public spending wasbrought into line.   He also played on disunity in the opposition, recalling theirchaotic six years in office, during which they had fourgovernments. The Social Democrats, who had governed for 44 yearsfrom 1932, returned to power in 1982.   The opposition parties attacked the government's failure to curbinflation, which has been running at 7 percent. They campaigned forreforms to reduce income taxes that slice 75 percent off the topbrackets. Taxes in Sweden equal more than 55 percent of the grossnational product, the highest in the world.   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson attributed his party's victoryto a healthy economy and a platform of careful tax reform.   ``We wanted to develop welfare, while the other parties wantedto dismantle parts of it ... That is very stupid of them,'' he said.   Pre-election predictions had said the Greens, officially calledthe Environment Party, would hold the balance of power between theleft and the center-right blocs, giving the novice party unusualleverage.</TEXT></DOC>
