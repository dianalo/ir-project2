Separately, Sun said Intergraph Corp. agreed to purchasecomputers from Sun valued at $150 million over three years.</LP><TEXT>   The moves are modest but important victories for Sun inits battle to persuade computer makers to use its Sparcchips, which employ reduced-instruction-set computing, orRISC, technology. Many computer makers favor RISC chips overconventional technologies because they provide higher speedsby simplifying the chips internal workings.   Sun is battling with other RISC-chip makers such as MipsComputer Systems Inc. and Motorola Inc., each of which wantsto woo a critical mass of computer companies to establish itsarchitecture as a standard, much as Intel Corp.'s chips are astandard for the personal computer.   While Sun's machines have grabbed the biggest share of themarket for computer workstations, Mips has won over a larger,more diverse range of computer makers to its chip.   A spokesman for Amdahl, a maker of mainframe computersthat are compatible with International Business MachinesCorp.'s machines, wouldn't say what kinds of machines thecompany intended to design around the Sparc chip.</TEXT></DOC>
