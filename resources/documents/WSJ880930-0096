Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh take a back seat to no one in their support for Republican presidential nominee George Bush.    Sen. Simpson, the assistant Republican leader of the Senate, was a finalist on Mr. Bush's list of vice-presidential candidates. And Mr. Thornburgh, who recently became attorney general for the final months of the Reagan administration, has let it be known that he would like to stay in the job next year if Mr. Bush wins the White House.    But the two men share something else in common: Both are former members of the American Civil Liberties Union.    The 68-year-old rights group has become a focal point in the presidential campaign between Vice President Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis; Mr. Bush frequently informs audiences that Mr. Dukakis is a &quot;card-carrying member of the ACLU.&quot;    In the current debate, Mr. Bush is using the ACLU to pin a &quot;liberal&quot; label on his Democratic challenger. But the ACLU has relied throughout much of its history on Republican support and has allied itself with Republicans on numerous issues. In the current controversy, some Republicans are trying to minimize their past involvement.    One such Republican is Mr. Thornburgh, the former governor of Pennsylvania, who was a director of the Pittsburgh chapter from 1967 to 1969. In a statement last week, Mr. Thornburgh said he resigned in 1969 from the ACLU because he thought it was pursuing a &quot;political agenda, many portions of which I strongly disagreed with . . .&quot;    Present and former officials of the Pittsburgh chapter say, however, that Mr. Thornburgh never told them of his disaffection with the group's goals and that he said he was resigning because he was soon to become U.S. attorney. Yesterday, Loye Miller, chief spokesman for Mr. Thornburgh, said Mr. Thornburgh &quot;was a politic man then, as he is now&quot; and didn't feel it necessary at the time to criticize the group.    Sen. Simpson's memory on when and how long he was an ACLU member is shaky. Last year, at a Senate hearing, he said he &quot;joined in the late 1950s&quot; and also said he was a member &quot;for several years&quot; until the ACLU decided to support the right of Nazis to march in Skokie, Ill., in 1977. Yesterday, however, a spokeswoman for Sen. Simpson said the senator may have misspoken last year, and now thinks he may have been a member for only a brief time.    At the hearing last year, Sen. Simpson said he joined because he &quot;thought they were doing great work in the area of . . . protection of personal privacy and rights, and I still think they do a lot of great and good things, but they also did some things which just said to me, 'I think I have had enough.'&quot;    The ACLU has had and still has other Republican support. Former Republican national Co-chairwoman Mary Crisp, former Michigan Gov. William Milliken and Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut are on the ACLU's national advisory board. And in years past, President Eisenhower, then New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and Gen. Douglas MacArthur expressed support for the ACLU.    The ACLU advisory board has also included some left-wing activists, such as William Kunstler, civil-liberties lawyer, currently on the board.    The ACLU has taken many positions over the years that have infuriated conservatives. It has championed the rights of criminal defendants, constitutional protection for obscenity and pornography and the need to strictly maintain separation of church and state.    But it has also championed former White House aide Oliver North's effort to have criminal charges against him dropped, arguing that he can't be prosecuted after he was forced to testify before a congressional committee.    And earlier this week, the ACLU filed a brief in support of Lyn Nofziger, former White House aide and longtime political adviser to President Reagan. Mr. Nofziger was convicted in February of illegally lobbying senior White House aides after leaving the government. His case is on appeal, and the ACLU argues that the government failed to prove that Mr. Nofziger knew the issues on which he lobbied were covered by federal ethics law. </TEXT></DOC>
