Increase of electron mobility at T=77 K in ELdoped with IVI and REI depending on the type, concentration of the dopingimpurity as well as on the degree of donor compensation by acceptorsis observed. The results are interpreted from the view point of ''close''donor-acceptor pair formation in IVI and REI elastic field scatteringelectrons, as a dipole with an arm L. For GaP:Yb=10-15 A, for GaP:InL=25-30A.</TEXT></DOC>
