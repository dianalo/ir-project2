Bacon   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/01/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A2</SO><IN>ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)BANKS (BNK)</IN><GV>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Bank regulators plan today to announce apackage of accounting changes designed to help ease thecredit crunch, but it will be months before the most eagerlyanticipated proposal, called loan-splitting, can take effect.   Many bankers see the decision to allow loan-splitting, aprocedure that would help bank profits by letting banks writeoff part of a troubled loan and continue to earn income onthe balance, as a sign that regulators are more sympatheticto the banking industry's problems.</LP><TEXT>   But the regulators, afraid of repeating the type ofregulatory blunder that helped lead to the savings-and-loancrisis, are moving cautiously. They have decided to put theloan-splitting proposal out for 45 days of public comment tomake sure it passes all accounting tests. &quot;The worst mistakemade in the thrift disaster was the move to weaken accountingrules&quot; and to hide the full dimensions of the evolvingproblem, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman RichardBreeden explained.   While announcing that they will seek public comment on theloan-splitting proposal they hope to issue in a week or two,the regulators will issue several other accountingclarifications designed to make life easier for bankers. Thepackage &quot;is intended to give comfort to bankers, who fearthat if they move a muscle, the regulators will jump all overthem,&quot; one regulator said.   The package will:   -- Stress that undercapitalized banks can continue to makeloans and to work with existing borrowers to work outtroubled loans, as long as they have a clear plan to improvetheir ratio of capital to assets.   -- Make it clear that rules and regulatory decisionsdesigned to reduce risk by forcing banks to lower theconcentration of loans in commercial real estate allow agradual reduction.   -- Highlight that current rules allow bank examiners tolook at the expected cash flow from a property thatcollateralizes a loan, rather than the lower liquidationvalue of the property. This will reduce the amount ofreserves that some banks will have to hold against troubledloans and will help bank profits.   -- Clarify that if a bank purchases a troubled loan fromanother bank or from the government agencies that liquidatefailed banks and thrifts, it can immediately start bookinginterest from that loan as income. This current provisionisn't well understood, regulators said.   By announcing these interpretations and quickly gettingthe word out to bankers and bank examiners, officials at theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Federal Reserve Board,the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Officeof Thrift Supervision hope to clear up some of the doubtsthat have made some bankers reluctant to lend.   ---   Kevin G.
