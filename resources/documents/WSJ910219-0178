Consider the issue of German defense for Turkey, a fellowNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization member that shares a longborder with Iraq and that Saddam Hussein has threatened toattack.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I've gotten questions from people asking me whether oneScud missile landing on Turkish soil is a case of war for theentire {NATO} alliance,&quot; says Mr. Stoltenberg. Or must theIraqis lob two over the border before the Germans getdirectly involved? &quot;Or must it be 20?&quot;   Mr. Stoltenberg doesn't even try to answer. No responsewould be likely to satisfy Germany's anti-war protesters orBonn's political opposition. Critics howled that Germany wasbeing dragged into war when it agreed to send aging Alphajets and anti-aircraft batteries to try to ensure the Iraqisdon't attack Turkey.   Only a few months ago, the main issue in Germany seemed tobe how quickly it could enjoy the peace and harmony of thepost-Cold War era. Mr. Stoltenberg, best known for his 6 1/2years as Bonn's no-nonsense finance minister, was one of thefew German politicians who consistently warned over the pastyear that dangers were lurking -- not only in the Mideast butalso in the Soviet Union.   The 62-year-old Mr. Stoltenberg says Germany is coming toterms with these rough realities and what they mean for thenewly unified nation. It is a difficult time, magnified bywhat Mr. Stoltenberg calls the &quot;illusions&quot; many peopledeveloped over the past year as barriers between East andWest collapsed and the Soviet military threat evaporated. TheGermans thus expected the future to be peaceful, he says, andwere unprepared for the jolt of war.   The crisis has set off a wave of emotion in Germany.Though anti-war protests have occurred from Karachi toChicago, the Germans have distinguished themselves with thesize and intensity of their protests, complete with ananti-American tinge. Americans have been upset at the sightof wealthy Germans, long defended by the U.S. military,suddenly lashing out at a close ally. Some Europeans whosupport the war effort, particularly the British, called thisGerman furor evidence that EC political unity remains a pipedream.   Yet Mr. Stoltenberg insists these protesters reflect onlya minority opinion. For most Germans, he says, the Gulf warand turbulent events in the Soviet Union's Baltic republicshave reminded them that they still need strong defenses --and strong friends in the West, above all the U.S.   Despite the protests, the latest surveys show most Germans-- in some cases more than 70% -- now support using forceagainst Iraq. But the real issue is whether Germans shouldtake part in this action. Most Germans remain overwhelminglypacifist, and this -- in the eyes of some allies -- makesthem unreliable.   But Mr. Stoltenberg says the problem is partly a publicrelations issue. He notes that governments, including theU.S., usually understand the political limitations imposed onGermany by its history, including what Bonn considers aconstitutional ban on using German forces outside NATOterritory. In addition, the war hit as Germany wasreconstituting its government after a national election,which slowed Bonn's reaction. Mr. Stoltenberg says newsorganizations and others tend to lose sight of these things.   He concedes, however, that Germany needs to do more toshow solidarity with the U.S.-led anti-Iraq coalition. Thuslate last month, Bonn announced an additional $5.5 billion offinancial support for the U.S., $533 million for Britain anda huge military package for Israel.   German officials said their total troop deployment, inconjunction with aircraft and air defenses committed toTurkey, will bring the German troop presence in that countryto more than 1,000. In addition, Germany has increased itsforces in the Mediterranean by sending four frigates andthree maritime patrol aircraft, boosting the German presencethere to 2,100 men.   Mr. Stoltenberg says he believes these actions will helpdispel the image of Germany as a hesitant observer of theGulf conflict, while driving home to the Germans the need toshake off insular attitudes.   &quot;In the long term,&quot; he says, &quot;we cannot expect thisdivision of labor, where the U.S. takes the paramountresponsibility in the military field while the Europeancontribution is comparatively weak.&quot;   But he's not overly optimistic about any suddenbreakthrough. Last autumn, Mr. Stoltenberg confidentlypredicted Bonn would grapple quickly with a proposedconstitutional change that would allow its troops to joinUnited Nations military operations outside Europe. ChancellorHelmut Kohl recently called such a change a goal of his newadministration.   But the defense minister now says the change almostcertainly won't be made before the Gulf war ends. And somemembers of Mr. Stoltenberg's Christian Democrat party aredropping the idea entirely. They worry that a constitutionaldebate -- in a climate of anti-war furor -- would only leadto greater restrictions on the use of German forces.   Without such a legal change, the tortured debate overTurkey is likely to continue as well. German anti-waractivists argue that the NATO alliance was meant to deal withonly a Soviet threat. They say an attack on a NATO country byIraq falls outside its scope. The German government, whilepledging alliance solidarity, tries to sidestep the issue.   Mr. Stoltenberg still refuses to answer the question ofwhat Germany would do if a single Iraqi missile landed inTurkey. He says his country would meet its obligations in thecase of a &quot;real aggression.&quot; But, he says, &quot;you can definewhen the time comes what that means.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
