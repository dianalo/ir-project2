<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-86-0087 </DOCNO><TEXT>51 swimming pools of the most varying types were constructed with fundingfrom the EC Commission in a number of Member States as part of the ECEnergy Demonstration Programme. In addition to the solar energy systemsproper, the pools were equipped with pool covers, heat recovery systemsand heat pumps. A review of the structure, performance and economic efficiencyof these solar heated swimming pools was given and an exchange of experienceswith solar collectors, hydraulics and control for solar systems, poolcovers, heat recovery systems and the running of these solar heated poolstook place at a conference. Summaries of the individual lectures (fromthree conference sessions) are given in this report. The overall viewof the conference was that solar technology for swimming pool heatingis fully developed and commercialised. The dissemination of informationand knowledge about this solar heating technology for swimming poolswill continue to advance. A separate summary of contents has been drawnup for each of the lectures.
