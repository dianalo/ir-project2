The description is at bestsuperficial and at worst deliberately deceptive. What ismainly going on in Central Asia is a variation on what ishappening elsewhere in the Soviet Union, including theTranscaucasus, the Baltic states, Ukraine and now Russiaitself: a rebellion against Soviet authority.   Central Asia, a wild area inhabited by some of thecountry's more primitive peoples, might at first glance seemto be among the least important territories Mikhail Gorbachevstands to lose as his vast empire crumbles. The sleeplessnights he complained of to Margaret Thatcher no doubt aremainly attributable to Boris Yeltsin and what he is doingwith the Russian Federation's legislature. Last Friday itboldly voted to give its own laws precedence over Sovietlaws, directly challenging Mr. Gorbachev's power.</LP><TEXT>   But don't underrate Central Asia. Moscow has a vitalinterest there. It's called gold.   The Soviets have been actively selling gold to earn theforeign exchange they desperately need to pay their debts andbuy food and other necessities. Central Asia's Kyzil-Kumdesert just happens to be a major center of Soviet goldmining. The region also is a source of other valuableminerals, uranium, lead, zinc, oil and gas.   Which helps explain why the Soviets have just dispatchedseveral thousand troops to Central Asia to stop &quot;inter-ethnicstrife.&quot; That expression is getting a bit shopworn.&quot;Inter-ethnic strife&quot; between Azeris and Armenians was theexcuse for troops shooting their way into the Azerbaijanicapital of Baku early this year. Chess wizard Gary Kasparov,an Armenian, wrote on this page in late March his belief thatthe KGB stirred up the Azeri-Armenian clashes to provide apretext for clamping down on nationalist movements. Indeed,Soviet defense chief Yazov let the cat out by blurting out inthe midst of the slaughter that the troops were sent in tosave the Azeri Communist Party, which had in effect beendeposed by a national front.   Uzbek-Kirghiz clashes in the Kirghiz capital of Frunze andalong the border of the two republics are of a similarpattern. Reading between the lines of Tass and officialreports -- the only sources of information as glasnostdoesn't apply to Soviet hot spots -- one finds that a lot ofthe popular anger has been directed at state buildings, 31 ofwhich have been torched. That's anti-government, notinter-ethnic. Deaths -- 102 at last count -- seem mainly theresult of shooting by the Soviet regular army, KGB borderguards and Interior Ministry forces. That's a lot like Baku.   Some anonymous KGB officer may deserve a medal fordreaming up &quot;inter-ethnic strife.&quot; It excuses troop actionand can be used to persuade the world that there will be morestrife, and suffering, if nationalism triumphs over authorityin the Soviet empire.   The idea isn't foolproof. Efforts to stir up &quot;inter-ethnicstrife&quot; between Russian nationals and ethnic Balts seem tohave fizzled. Baltic Russians seem not to have much more lovefor Moscow than do the ethnic Balts.   Central Asia, for its part, is not as backward as somethink. Popular movements, such as &quot;Ashar&quot; in Kirghizia and&quot;Birlik&quot; in Uzbekistan, have been gaining strength,exploiting such sources of discontent as the region'spoverty, conscription of local youths and the dumping ofnuclear wastes near Tashkent, the populous Uzbek capital.Central Asia also has been able to establish some trade andpolitical contacts with the outside world. According to aRadio Liberty analysis, the Uzbeks have had a flurry of tradedelegation exchanges with foreign governments, such asBelgium and South Korea, and with foreign businesses. SaudiArabia sent them one million Korans as a goodwill gesture.More to the point, the Uzbeks have been in the forefrontamong those Soviet republics threatening to seize control ofthe resources of their own region on grounds that Moscow isstealing their natural wealth.   Uzbekistan's prime minister, Shukrulla RahmatovichMirsaidov, recently issued a declaration of &quot;economicindependence&quot; in a speech to the republic's parliament. Heprotested what he called Moscow's exploitation of therepublic. He declared that &quot;all of the most valuable elementsof national possession&quot; must henceforth be recognized as theproperty of the republic.   To Moscow, that meant gold, uranium, oil and gas.&quot;Inter-ethnic strife&quot; and the intervention of Soviet troopssoon followed Mr. Mirsaidov's declaration.</TEXT></DOC>
