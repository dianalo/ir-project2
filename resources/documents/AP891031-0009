The ``Black Book,'' discovered in 1945 after the defeat ofGermany in World War II, listed 2,820 top people to be wiped out,including Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden, theforeign minister.   Some of the prominent Britons on the list gathered Tuesday atLondon's Imperial War Museum, where one of two known copies of thelist is kept. The other is in the United States.   The book gives the address of each target, as well as details oftrade unions and other organizations to be eradicated.   One target, 92-year-old author Naomi Mitchison, said she wentand talked over her predicament with a fisherman when shediscovered from government contacts in 1940 that she was on a listof people to be executed.   ``He said I shouldn't worry because they would take me away toAmerica on a fishing boat, provided they could get the fuel,'' Mrs.Mitchison said. ``I thought that a bit unlikely and dangerous atthe time but I was very upset.''   Poet Sir Stephen Spender, 80, said: ``I felt honored to be init. Leonard Woolf, Virginia Woolf's husband, and I had a suicidepact because it was obvious we would be on a hit list. We didn'tactually do anything more about it. It's a good job we won.''   When novelist Rebecca West learned after the book's discoverythat she was on the list with Noel Coward, she wrote the playwrightsaying: ``My dear, the people we should have been dead with!''   One blunder is the inclusion of Sigmund Freud, who died in 1938.Playwright Lord Willis, who is also on the death list, said: ``Amistake like that disproves the German image of efficiency.''</TEXT></DOC>
