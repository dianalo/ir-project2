Among the model's features are separationof pipelines bidding for new reserves, which is based on projected futuredemand, from natural gas production, which is based on current demand.GAMS also contains explicit representations of natural gas contract provisions,including take-or-pay clauses and definite and indefinite pricing escalatorprovisions. GAMS now has been successfully linked to EIA's IntermediateFuture Forecasting System (IFFS) which contains process models of demandas well as the capability to analyze supply, demand, and pricing forother fuels. The need to analyze the natural gas market, including alternativedecontrol and pricing options and their impacts on the U.S. natural gassystem, provided the main incentive for EIA to develop GAMS. The projectionsare also provided as a service to other branches of the Department ofEnergy, the Federal Government, and non-Federal public and private institutionsconcerned with the domestic natural gas economy.</TEXT></DOC>
