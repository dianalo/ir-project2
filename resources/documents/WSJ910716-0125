Corn and soybean prices plunged at the Chicago Board ofTrade just before the end of trading on June 26, as traderssold hundreds of grain-futures contracts after learning thecontents of the National Weather Service's six-to-10-dayforecast, people familiar with the incident said. The weatherservice publicly released the report after trading ended at2:15 p.m. EDT.</LP><TEXT>   At the time, hot and dry conditions were threatening thecorn and soybean crops throughout much of the Midwest anddriving grain futures prices higher at the Board of Trade.The six-to-10-day forecast predicted cooler temperatures andrain.   The Inspector General's Office of the federal CommerceDepartment, which has jurisdiction over the National WeatherService, began investigating after Board of Trade ChairmanWilliam F. O'Connor wrote to the office complaining about anapparent &quot;leak&quot; of the market-moving forecast.   &quot;We did get the letter, and we're looking into thesituation,&quot; said Wayne Weaver, counsel to Commerce DepartmentInspector General Frank DeGeorge. Mr. Weaver declined furthercomment.   The inspector general's office plans to interview NationalWeather Service forecasters responsible for the six-to-10-dayforecast, which is released on Mondays, Wednesdays andFridays. While the commodities markets haven't any directequivalent of the stock market's insider-trading law,Commerce Department regulations prohibit early release ofweather service information.   A weather service spokeswoman said the agency wouldcooperate with the investigation.   Some traders, analysts and private weather forecasterssaid the leak of market-moving National Weather Serviceforecasts is a longstanding problem. They said it occurredthroughout the weather-dominated market of summer 1988,during which drought conditions created a raging bull marketin grain futures at the Board of Trade.   &quot;It's been a thorn in our firm's side for about the pastthree years,&quot; said Daniel W. Basse, director of marketresearch for AgResource Co., Chicago. &quot;There should be alevel playing field, even in the wild, wild west ofcommodities trading. Why should one group of people get thereport early just because they're willing to pay for it?&quot;   The source of the most recent leak may be a formeremployee of the National Weather Service's main forecastingcenter in Suitland, Md., according to people in thecommodities industry and at the weather service. On June 26,this former employee may have entered the forecasting center,obtained an advance look at the weather report and sold theinformation to at least one firm that trades grains at theBoard of Trade.   The exchange chairman, Mr. O'Connor, fired off his letterto the Commerce Department's investigations unit after othergrain-trading firms, including Minneapolis-based CargillInc., complained.   In the letter, Mr. O'Connor complained that weatherservice forecasts aren't guarded as zealously as othermarket-moving government data, such as the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's crop estimates and reports on economicindicators.   &quot;We have received reports that these forecasts, so vitalto the nation's agricultural economy, are being selectivelyleaked for the benefit of a few,&quot; Mr. O'Connor said in theletter. &quot;While we have no direct evidence of such leaks, webelieve that the degree to which precise knowledge of thereports apparently is available prior to their public releasewarrants investigation.&quot;   On June 26, the advance knowledge of the six-to-10-dayforecast circulating among some Board of Trade grain traderswas precise indeed. It included a state-by-state breakdown ofthe prospects for rain and favorable temperatures inIllinois, Indiana and Missouri, said Peter Leavitt, executivevice president of WeatherServices Corp., Bedford, Mass., aprivate weather forecasting company. Mr. Leavitt serves on anadvisory committee to the National Weather Service.   &quot;The market broke, as the word got around the floor thatthe National Weather Service forecast was going to go forcooler temperatures and more rain than normal,&quot; Mr. Leavittsaid. The prices of soybean and corn contracts for Julydelivery plunged several cents a bushel within minutes.   WeatherService's Mr. Leavitt and a meteorologist forCargill, John Cawhorn, have conducted an informal inquiry oftheir own into the leak. They have concluded that it couldn'thave come from any of the National Weather Service's regionaloffices.   &quot;We checked, and they didn't get the forecast until aftertrading ended,&quot; Mr. Cawhorn said. The only other source ofthe six-to-10-day forecast, they said, is the mainforecasting center in Maryland.   The two forecasters also think the center has been thesource of previous leaks. &quot;It started during the drought of1988,&quot; Mr. Cawhorn said. &quot;At that time it was a regularoccurrence. About two minutes after {2 p.m. EDT}, the wordwould hit the floor: `Here's an early look at thesix-to-10day forecast.'&quot; After 1988, Messrs. Cawhorn andLeavitt said, the leaks stopped and didn't resurface untillast month.   The irony, Mr. Leavitt says, is that the six-to-10-dayforecast isn't very accurate. The rain predicted in the June26 forecast, for instance, never materialized. &quot;It's wellknown, however, that it has influence on the market,&quot; Mr.Leavitt said. &quot;The market moves on rumor, and advanceknowledge of rumor often is as good as advance knowledge ofreality.&quot;   In commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum product prices fell acrossthe board in a technical correction to some of last week'sgains. Although fundamentals haven't changed, marketparticipants chose to take profits, traders said. Crude forAugust delivery declined 25 cents a barrel, to $21.47, on theNew York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts for later deliveryalso fell. There had been a number of Middle East rumors lastweek that supported the market, but traders said yesterday'sspeculation was that tensions have eased. August gasolinesettled at 63.38 cents a gallon, down 1.18 cents, on the NewYork Merc. Heating oil, where much of last week's tradingfocused, also fell. The August contract settled at 59.60cents a gallon, down 0.95 cent.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices fell. Coffee for September deliveryfell 1.95 cents a pound to 83.25 cents. Some forecasters hadpredicted freezing temperatures in Brazil over the weekend,which caused prices to rally on Friday. But temperatures wereabove 50 degrees in the Brazilian coffee belt during theweekend, said Joel Burgio, senior meteorologist, WeatherServices Corp., Bedford, Mass. Disappointed traders who hadbet on a price rise liquidated their positions by sellingoffsetting contracts, said Arthur Stevenson, analyst atPrudential Securities. Sandra Kaul, analyst at ShearsonLehman Brothers, said another factor putting pressure onprices was news yesterday that less Brazilian government farmcredit will be issued to coffee farmers this year. Tradersbelieve farmers won't have enough financing to hold ontocoffee harvested early in the season, as they have in recentyears to take advantage of later price rises caused by frostor other problems, she said. Farmers won't have as muchflexibility this year, she added, and they will have to sellcoffee just to raise enough money to harvest. Mr. Stevensonsaid that, over the next few days, traders will be cautiousas they wait to see if anything comes out of the meetingbetween the presidents of Colombia and Brazil on Thursday. Awide range of economic issues will be discussed, includingcoffee policy, he said, and traders will be looking for anyclues about Brazil's position on a return to an internationalcoffee quota system.                                                                                                          COTTON: Rain in West Texas over the weekend caused futuresprices to fall. October cotton lost 1.75 cents a pound to endat 68.66 cents, while December cotton ended 1.15 cents apound lower at 68.29 cents. Rain is a precious commodity inWest Texas during July, and the area had soaking rains overthe weekend, a meteorologist said. Ernest Simon, cottonspecialist at Prudential Securities, said, &quot;That's what theparched area needed. It looks like a pretty nice crop coulddevelop there.&quot; Mr. Simon predicted the price could declinefurther over the next few weeks to the mid-60s or below,barring a very bad storm in cotton growing areas.</TEXT></DOC>
