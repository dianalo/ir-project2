Illegal fireworks were blamed for a blaze that swept over 2,200 rugged acres of Stanislaus National Forest in California, 10 miles west of Yosemite National Park. The fire, which began Saturday, was 90% contained Monday afternoon, said Mary Hale, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry. &quot;We have evidence confirming that it (the cause) was a bottle rocket,&quot; she said.    The fire was the largest in the forest this year. Stanislaus was the scene of huge wildfires last summer.    A four-day fire in 1,100 acres of Hiawatha National Park in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan also was said to be under control, though continued hot dry weather could mean weeks before the fire is extinguished.    &quot;It's been real quiet out there,&quot; Sgt. Terry Leisening of the Delta County Sheriff's Department said. &quot;I think they've got it just about out.&quot;    U.S. Forest Service spokesman Dale Bluedorn agreed, but said patrols will continue. &quot;It may not be declared out until there's a three-day rain.&quot;    A small contingent of firefighters, who hiked into the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness Monday in south-central Montana, contained portions of a 2,000-acre fire that has been burning there since June 19, forest officials said.    Forest Service policy allows wilderness fires to burn unless they threaten trails or structures, or threaten to burn outside the wilderness boundary.    The firefighters were called in to stop the flames as they neared the Stillwater River Trail inside the wilderness area. High winds Saturday tripled the fire's size.    Phil Jaquith, Beartooth District ranger for the Custer National Forest, said the bulk of the fire on the east banks of the Stillwater River wasn't being suppressed.    Cooler temperatures and calmer winds played a role in getting the blaze contained on the west riverbank, which is about two miles from the trail, Mr. Jaquith said. </TEXT></DOC>
