Peak temperatures were in the range of 454 to 538{sup 0}C.At the lower temperatures and in the absence of long hold times cyclinghardening occurred. At higher temperatures ratchetting rates in two-barexperiments were approximately constant. Recovery of the yield strengthduring the hold period at the peak temperature was thought to be themost significant factor controlling the ratchetting.</TEXT></DOC>
