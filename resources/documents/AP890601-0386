DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defense attorneys at the securities fraud trialof Singer Co. Chairman Paul Bilzerian accused the judge ofprejudicing the jury and asked him to declare a mistrial Thursday.   U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward, who has grown increasinglyirritated with the slow pace of Bilzerian's questioning by defenselawyer Arthur Mathews, denied the request.   Although he told lawyers that he had ``bent over backwards'' toaccommodate the defense at times, Ward later told the jury:``Ladies and gentlemen, I may have appeared to have been impatientwith Mr. Mathews. I would instruct you that this should not betaken as an indication of any view of mine on the merits of thecase.''   The trial, the first prosecution of a corporate raider usinginformation derived from the Ivan F. Boesky insider trading probe,is winding up its fifth week.   Bilzerian, 38, of Tampa, Fla., is accused of conspiracy,violating securities and tax laws and making false statements inconnection with four failed takeover attempts in 1985 and 1986.   None of the charges involve Bilzerian's $1.06 billion takeoverof Singer last year.   Bilzerian has been on the witness stand since Tuesday, mostly ondirect examination by Matthews. The defense was forced to alter itsstrategy after Ward issued an unfavorable ruling that would havehelped the government's cross-examination.   Since that ruling, Bilzerian's testimony has dealt in minutedetail with the four takeover bids charged in the indictment.   When Mathews said he wanted to complete his questioning afterthe lunch break, the judge told him in a loud voice: ``No, I wantyou to finish your examination. I have kept the jury now so that wecould conclude it. You know we have matters to take up between thedirect and cross-examination. You will finish this, please.''   Later, when Bilzerian's testimony drifted off into a long storyabout how he sought an intermediary in one of the takeoverattempts, Ward lifted a book above the bench and dropped it inapparent exasperation.   The judge stood up and told Mathews, ``If your client couldn'tknow by now that he is not supposed to testify in this way, I willhave to tell him.''   Ward added: ``I suggest further that you restructure yourquestions concerning conversations and that we not get into thisnarrative. I don't think it's helpful, under the circumstances.''   With the jury out of the room, Mathews later asked Ward todeclare a mistrial, saying his actions were prejudicial to thedefense.   The judge declined and the trial resumed.   Under cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney DavidBrodsky, Bilzerian called a prosecution witness, stock traderMichael Landy, a liar.   Landy, a trader at the California brokerage, Jefferies andamp; Co.,testified that Bilzerian promised to reverse a 1985 stock sale inorder to create illegal tax losses.   ``I watched Michael Landy on the stand a few weeks ago and Ihave no problem calling him a liar,'' said Bilzerian.   His cross-examination was to continue Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
