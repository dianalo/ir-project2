Japanese bankers say they have lost their 1980s appetitefor bankrolling 35% to 50% of the loans for many majorleveraged buy-outs.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Now we are extremely cautious,&quot; says Toru Kusukawa,Tokyo-based deputy president of Fuji Bank Ltd.   His view is shared by many Japanese bankers. It helpsexplain why buy-out financing nowadays is extremely hard toget -- and why shares of U.S. companies that might be buy-outtargets are languishing. In a buy-out, a company's publiclyheld stock is bought up by a small, debt-financed group,often including management.   The Japanese retreat was sparked when Japan's banks gotembroiled in their first major U.S. bankruptcy-law case, lastwinter's filings by two Campeau Corp. subsidiaries, AlliedStores and Federated Department Stores. Many Japanese banksare becoming more selective in pursuing the fat fees andprestige associated with funding leveraged buy-outs.   Oddly enough, the plunging Japanese stock market also isat the root of the banks' new-found reluctance. The stockswoon in Tokyo is eroding the capital base of the banks, bycutting the value of their stockholdings in other Japanesecompanies. And this is happening just as the banks arestriving to meet tightened international standards for bankcapital.   Banks in the major industrial countries doing cross-borderbusiness must have capital equal to at least 8% of theirassets by 1993. Under the new rules, some of which takeeffect next year, Japan's banks can count as part of theircapital 45% of the paper gains on their Japanesestockholdings. But with Japanese stock prices down more than35% this year and the banks' stock portfolios shriveling invalue, several banks are believed to be close to, if notbelow, the 8% ratio.   This is worrisome to the Japanese banks, several of whichgot stung in the financial hornet's nest of FederatedDepartment Stores.   Fuji Bank, for instance, initially intended to steer clearof the Federated buy-out, then learned that rival SumitomoBank Ltd. was participating. &quot;We said, `They are in it, sowhy not?,'&quot; Mr. Kusukawa of Fuji Bank says. &quot;That was thebiggest mistake we made.&quot;   He adds: &quot;We never expected this drastic change in the`junk' bond market. Two years ago, everybody was soenthusiastic.&quot; Prices have slumped in the past year forhigh-yield junk, and recession fears are preying on this $200billion public market.   Sanwa Bank, also caught with a big chunk of Federatedloans on its books, is weighing &quot;a number of ideas where wewould like to improve our {loan} approval system,&quot; JunichiGoto, a Tokyo-based senior managing director at the bank,says. &quot;We feel LBOs have had their day in the sun.&quot;   Moreover, Japan's banks have invested about $1 billion inleveraged buy-out funds, many of them assembled by U.S.investment banks. The Japanese banks are upset that a lot ofthis money hasn't even been invested and that returns on somedeals have been below expectations. As a U.S. bankerconcedes: &quot;They made capital commitments to these funds forfive to seven years, and they are being charged a heftyannual service charge -- about 1%. And the funds aren't doinganything.&quot;   U.S. takeover activity in general is slow because of tightcredit conditions, a shaky junk bond market and a weakeconomy. Japanese bankers also emphasize factors specific totheir own institutions that make them particularly cautious.   Japanese bankers say that regulators in both Japan and theU.S., as well as American credit-rating companies, areconcerned about lending related to buy-outs. Three weeks ago,Moody's Investors Service cited Fuji Bank's &quot;relatively highexposure to highly leveraged transactions,&quot; among otherreasons, in downgrading the bank's long-term debt todouble-A-1 from triple-A. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., theworld's biggest bank, was similarly downgraded at the sametime. Though buy-out lending wasn't cited as a reason inDai-Ichi's case, Japanese bankers say the message is clear.   &quot;You have to restrain yourself from going up to a higherpercentage {of such loans} relative to your capital base,&quot;says the head of U.S. operations for another big Japanesebank.   Indeed, IBCA Ltd., a London-based credit rating concern,yesterday placed under review for possible downgrades itsratings on debt of several big Japanese banks: Dai-IchiKangyo, Fuji, Sanwa, Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., Sumitomo Bank andIndustrial Bank of Japan Ltd. IBCA cited the fall in theTokyo stock market and &quot;capital pressures&quot; on the banks.   In July, 12 Japanese banks did supply $920 million of a$2.25 billion loan that was part of a refinancing of RJRNabisco Inc. But fees on that transaction were unusuallytempting. In addition, Japanese bankers have long believedthat if the tobacco and food company ever went under, a saleof its parts could easily cover their loans.   Still, the RJR deal is adding to their doubts aboutleveraged buy-outs. Several Japanese banks said they placedall of their new RJR loans in a $1.4 billion pool, seeking tosell the debt to smaller U.S. banks and other foreignfinancial institutions. The pool expired Aug. 24, leavingmuch of the RJR debt unsold -- mostly because the lead bankswere reluctant to share their fat fees with prospectivebuyers.   Beginning this week, each of the banks that originated the$2.25 billion credit can try to sell its own loansindividually. A U.S. banker involved in the RJR loans says heisn't overly worried; he argues that the debt will be soldeventually.   The Japanese aren't so sanguine. They fear they will bestuck with too much of the RJR debt. Some institutions towhich they sold U.S. buy-out loans in the past -- notablyJapanese regional banks -- aren't eager to buy now.   A senior Japanese executive at a bank that joined in theinitial RJR syndicate says: &quot;The real intention in this dealwas to earn the fees, not interest income. Then you don'thave to keep the loans on your balance sheet.&quot;   Evidence of the waning appetite for highly leverageddeals, Japanese bankers say, is the buy-out of Saks FifthAvenue by Investcorp. Only three or four Japanese bankscontributed $100 million to $150 million combined, out of atotal $775 million in bank financing for the acquisition.(Some U.S. bankers contend that with buy-out transactionsshrinking in size, support from any particular group of banksisn't as important as in the past.)   Moreover, retreating from buy-out deals is tough for theJapanese banks. At a time when their cost of funds isskyrocketing and profit margins from corporate lending arerazor thin, buy-out deals offer hefty fee income. For thisreason, some U.S. bankers believe the Japanese will be back.   &quot;They might be saying they aren't interested in LBOfinancing because rating agencies have criticized them, andthe {Japanese} Finance Ministry is on their case. It's thepolitically correct thing to do,&quot; an American banker says.&quot;But if a good deal came their way, I don't think they'dhesitate.&quot;   Noting that &quot;there is still a need for restructuring inthe U.S.,&quot; Hideo Ishihara, deputy president of IndustrialBank of Japan in Tokyo, says: &quot;We expect takeovers tocontinue in the small and medium{sized} company area. We lookto remain relatively conservative, but will make loans if thecredit meets our criteria.&quot;   Nonetheless, Mr. Ishihara warns: &quot;In order to induce banksto lend, you need to structure deals more conservatively. Thedays of the megadeals like RJR Nabisco and so on are gone.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
