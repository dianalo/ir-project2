The Delaware Court of Chancery, which must approve the settlement proposal, has scheduled a hearing on the agreement Oct. 26.    Separately, the retailing concern said the settlement of a dispute over the sale of its John Wanamaker department store unit will result in a $4 million after-tax charge against earnings for the fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 1. As previously reported, Carter said it expects to report for the quarter significant charges and a net loss from its restructuring plan. A shareholder vote on the restructuring proposal is scheduled for Wednesday.    Carter Hawley will reduce the $183 million sale price of the Philadelphia-based unit, which it sold last December to Woodward andamp; Lothrop, a unit of Taubman Investment Co. of Bloomfield Hills, Mich. Woodward andamp; Lothrop had challenged the book value of the Wanamaker unit. A spokesman for Carter Hawley wasn't able to provide an adjusted sale price.    The proposed agreement on the restructuring lawsuits calls for the dismissal of several complaints filed in Delaware and California. In those complaints, shareholders alleged that the company and its executives had breached their fiduciary duty, and also claimed that the restructuring served to entrench current management.    The restructuring blocked a $1.93 billion hostile takeover offer by a company formed by Columbus, Ohio-based Limited Inc. and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.    The proposed agreement states that those who held Carter Hawley stock between Dec. 8, 1986 and Aug. 20, 1987 would drop any suits related to the restructuring, the unsolicited tender offer or an earlier hostile bid by Limited in 1984. The plaintiffs may also seek as much as $1,250,000 in legal fees from Carter Hawley.    Carter Hawley's stock closed in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday at $71.75 a share, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
