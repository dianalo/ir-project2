The GAO didn't recommend any specific capital levels,but said the new levels could be phased in over five years ormore to make it easier for banks to raise the money.   Significantly, the GAO shied away from recommendations tofundamentally change the deposit-insurance system itself --such as lowering the $100,000 insurance limit per account orlimiting depositors to a few accounts -- for fear of&quot;destabilizing the system.&quot;   The GAO's emphasis on capital and supervision, and itsworries about the possible disruption from major changes tothe deposit insurance system, echoed the views expressed byFederal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan several weeksago.   On the other side of the growing debate are somecongressmen, who would like to explicitly limit thegovernment's liability by cutting back coverage, and parts ofthe banking industry, which fears Congress won't grant banksnew securities and insurance powers unless coverage isreduced. The GAO plan &quot;doesn't seem to addressdeposit-insurance reform,&quot; said a spokeswoman for theAmerican Bankers Association.   The GAO said, &quot;We question, on grounds of stability,whether reducing deposit insurance coverage . . . should bethe centerpiece of reform.&quot; Instead, the GAO exhortedCongress to make sure regulators are closing troubled banksquickly enough, before they pile up losses that the depositinsurance fund must later handle when the bank fails.   The GAO is so concerned about the regulators that itcalled for a presidentially appointed panel to conduct a &quot;topto bottom&quot; study of the regulators' procedures and skills.The GAO also said the regulators shouldn't be given as muchdiscretion as they have now to allow troubled banks to growor pay dividends, among other actions.   While the GAO didn't present a blanket criticism of thebank regulators, the agency did warn that they may, in somecases, be following the dangerous path of their thriftcounterparts in allowing troubled institutions to remain opentoo long. Most experts agree that much of the $150 billioncost of the Sandamp;L industry bailout could have been avoided hadhundreds of troubled thrifts in the 1980s not been allowed tooperate for years.   The agency, an investigative arm of Congress, singled outthe regulators' recent handling of the failure of theNational Bank of Washington as a sign of its concern. TheOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency used new powersgranted to it last year to close the bank while it still hadsome equity capital remaining. (Previously, regulatorsusually waited until complete insolvency.)   But the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has said itexpects to lose about $500 million, or about 30% of thebank's assets, bailing out the institution, which &quot;indicatesthat OCC did not act soon enough,&quot; the GAO said. A spokesmanfor the Comptroller didn't have any immediate comment.</TEXT></DOC>
