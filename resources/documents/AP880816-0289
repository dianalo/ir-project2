In a 3-to-2 decision, the state Appellate Division in Brooklynupheld a lower court ruling that the woman, Mary O'Connor, can beremoved from all artificial life support systems.   Mrs. O'Connor, of the Bronx, has been physically and mentallyincapacitated by a series of strokes. Officials at WestchesterCounty Medical Center say she is conscious but unable to speak orswallow.   She has been fed intravenously, and the hospital also wanted touse a nasal feeding tube to provide nutrition.   The judgment was stayed for five days, however.   ``It's a precedent-setting situation,'' said Barry Bowman, aspokesman for the medical center. ``What we have here is aconscious patient and a decision being made by surrogates asopposed to a patient who is brain dead or in a persistent vegetatedstate.''   He said a decision had not been made whether to appeal to thestate Court of Appeals in Albany, New York's highest court.   The woman's daughters, both licensed practical nurses, initiatedthe right-to-die battle last month to stop the medical center frominserting the nasal feeding tube and to halt the intravenousfeeding.   They said their mother had told them on numerous occasions thatshe would not want to be kept alive by artificial means.   ``We agree with the Supreme Court that Mrs. O'Connor's desires,expressed when she was competent, to decline any life sustainingtreatment, including a naso-gastric tube and intravenous feeding,in her current condition, was established by clear and convincingevidence,'' said the decision written by Justice Guy Magano andsigned by Justices Moses Weinstein and Isaac Rubin. JusticesVincent Balletta and Richard Brown dissented.   Balletta wrote: ``In the absence of a medical consensus that apatient in Mrs. O'Connor's condition would not suffer severe painand thirst in the process of dying without hydration and nutrition,it is in my view that it is cruel and inhuman to sentence her todeath which will be accompanied by such extreme discomfort.''   Julius Cohn, who represents Mrs. O'Connor's daughters, said he``obviously agreed'' with the appeals court decision but said heexpected the legal battle to continue.   On July 26, state Supreme Court Justice Nicholas Colabellaordered that the medical center stop efforts to feed Mrs. O'Connorand allow her to die. Colabella directed that the hospital providepainkillers and help get Mrs. O'Connor home.   His trial-level ruling was stayed while the medical centerappealed to the Appellate Division.</TEXT></DOC>
