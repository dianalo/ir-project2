The commanderof an FMC-made Bradley armored fighting vehicle is worriedthat the Army will not supply him with spare parts in timefor combat. He wants to order the parts himself, and offershis personal Visa card for payment.   Mr. Takacs scans his computerized list of parts stockpiledby the Army for the 2,000 Bradleys at the front and findsthose the captain wants are already in a supply depot nearthe captain's position. &quot;Don't worry, sir. You'll get themsoon,&quot; assures Mr. Takacs, manager of product support for theBradleys.</LP><TEXT>   But the captain's wife in Germany soon follows up with afrantic plea via fax machine. So Mr. Takacs phones an FMCmilitary liaison working in Saudi Arabia, who persuadesmilitary officials to immediately deliver the parts. &quot;Just alittle Army supply glitch,&quot; Mr. Takacs says.   Crisis management is on a war footing at FMC. Shortlyafter the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August, the Journalvisited FMC to see what happens when a far-flung companytries to cope with a global crisis. Now, with war underway,FMC has stepped up its activities even more, particularlysince it now has its combat vehicles and employees to servicethem in the Gulf.   Many of its initial post-invasion plans have been altered,expanded or scrapped in favor of new strategies. Since theallied air attack began Jan. 16, FMC executives have beenmoving nonstop to prevent damage -- evacuating nonessentialemployees in the Middle East who are within the 350-milerange of Iraq's Scud missiles -- and taking advantage ofopportunities, such as gathering intelligence on thepotential market in Kuwait to replace damaged oilproductionequipment.   FMC, with $3.7 billion in annual sales, is the 48thbiggest exporter in the U.S. and has one of the largestinvolvements in the Middle East. It has long wooed that partof the world as a market for its array of oil production andshipping machinery, agrichemicals and armored fightingvehicles. As a result, the chaos of war is sparkingwidespread action at the company.   While some companies are canceling foreign business trips,FMC executives are still flying, sometimes into the war zoneitself. They also are busily planning to expand internationaloperations -- including in the Middle East -- soon after thewar ends. &quot;If we don't go, our competitors will,&quot; says BobHoffman, vice president of international operations. Forexample, FMC is quietly planning a new petroleum-equipmentplant for Saudi Arabia. &quot;Of course, we wouldn't want to startconstruction right now,&quot; he says.   At FMC headquarters in Chicago, plans are underway for anew international &quot;matrix organization&quot; that will reassignhigher-level executives than ever before to such locations asthe Middle East, South America and Europe. &quot;We're going tohave to find a way to do business in less secure parts of theworld -- in `status red' and `status yellow' countries,&quot; saysMr. Hoffman.   In recent weeks, the company has sent nine of itsarmored-weapons experts to a three-day class on chemicalwarfare survival techniques. They're arriving now at Armyunits in Saudi Arabia -- equipped with camouflage uniforms,duffel bags, Toyota four-wheel-drive trucks and GenevaConvention identification cards that testify to theircivilian status in case of capture.   One FMC military liaison already in Saudi Arabia, ThomasHutson, recently answered the complaint call of Army troopswhose Bradley had been rear-ended by another, bending thebackdoor so badly it wouldn't close. The frustrated soldiersset the door on the ground and drove a tank over it in aflattening effort, to no avail. Mr. Hutson cut through thebureaucracy to get a new door delivered within 24 hours.   Such service to customers could be crucial to FMC; thecompany has orders to sell the Pentagon 1,600 more of the$1.2 million Bradleys -- 400 of them for eventual delivery toSaudi Arabia. But a strong performance against SaddamHussein's army is essential to keep Congressional criticsquiet and more orders coming in. &quot;The chips are down for usnow,&quot; says Howard Girbach, operations director at FMC'sarmored-weapons division.   Although Bradleys haven't ventured into combat yet, theyhave taken plenty of potshots from Congressional critics whoquestion their high-tech capabilities and armor strength. APentagon memo earlier this month warned that a transmissiondefect could reduce the Bradley's top speed from 40 miles perhour to 10. The memo said the malfunction takes only 45minutes to repair. But Robert Malott, FMC's chairman, stillgets grilled about the problem occasionally at businessluncheons. &quot;I always say, `Glad you asked. Thosetransmissions are made by General Electric,'&quot; he saysimpatiently.   Worried over the threat of terrorism to FMC's 24,000employees, Mr. Malott now takes time to study three-a-dayglobal security briefings published by ex-CentralIntelligence Agency officials. &quot;I never would have read thesebefore,&quot; he says.   Copies of the security memos go to dozens of other FMCexecutives. James McClung, an FMC vice president, grumblesthat the briefings note &quot;all kinds of murders in variouscountries whether they're related to the war or not. If weknew all this about Chicago, we wouldn't come to work in themorning.&quot;   But the war follows Mr. McClung all the way to Hawaii,where he arrived for a meeting with Japanese customers onJan. 16, at the very hour U.S. warplane sorties began. Heheard the bombing news from a rental-car agent and jumped ina taxi. &quot;I postponed the Japanese to get right up to thetelevision in my room and start phoning our people,&quot; he says.   His emergency orders included: tightening creditrestrictions on customers in the Middle East, North Africaand certain Asian nations near the theater of conflict;ordering employees' dependents out of Pakistan -- whereterrorism is feared because of its large Muslim population --and organizing security support groups for those who insiston staying; restricting internal copies of executives' travelitineraries.   Every FMC department is on alert. Executives have beenchecking with suppliers to lock in costs on raw materialsbefore agreeing to long-term manufacturing contracts andtactfully negotiating with Kuwait to supply everything fromluggageloaders for airliners to petroleum-productionequipment after the war ends.   FMC has rushed cellular phones to salesmen overseas withorders to call headquarters if they learn of a bombing orother terrorist activity. It also is signing up volunteers tovisit customers in foreign trouble spots.   FMC is also lowering its profit estimates on its goldinvestments. Although FMC may yet benefit because it hasrecently ventured into mining gold, which often rises in timeof turmoil, the metal's price is down 10% from itspost-invasion peak. &quot;The fact that gold prices aren't up is asource of concern,&quot; says Frank Riddick, FMC's treasurer.Nevertheless, the company is still buying and selling goldfutures contracts that mature in 1993. Gold productionaccounted for 24% of FMC's $339.5 million pretax income in1990.   FMC has other worries, as well. Uncertainty surroundingIran's possible involvement in the conflict recently promptedFMC to pull several employees out of there -- raising doubtabout the future of the company's $15 million job to rebuildoil-shipping facilities. Immediately after the invasion, FMCput aside fears that Iraq would target its Iran project. Butuncertainty about Iran's status has risen lately, especiallysince Iraqi war planes have sought refuge there in recentdays. Yet FMC has told Iran it will merely postponecontractual obligations, not abandon them.   That contract could be a long time getting back on trackif the fears of Mr. Malott, the CEO, are realized. &quot;It willbe a lot tougher war than many people think. Dislodging theIraqis will be hard,&quot; he says. He yearns to see the Bushadministration seek a solution to the Palestinian quest for ahomeland &quot;as part of winning the peace.&quot;   The director of FMC's international business, Nha Hoang,has been working 18-hour days since the crisis began, oftenholding late-night strategy sessions with FMC sales andservice workers as far away as Ankara, Turkey.   Mr. Hoang, a former pilot in the air force of SouthVietnam, encourages a salesman in Ankara to stay put despiteScud attacks in Saudi Arabia and Israel. &quot;We're monitoringthose attacks, and the Scuds can't reach the 465 miles toAnkara,&quot; he tells the employee. After hanging up, he shrugsto a visitor, &quot;Besides, our competitors in Europe still go toAnkara.&quot;   FMC's 39-member international-operations staff has devisedseveral possible evacuation routes for employees and theirfamilies in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Oman, where new oil wellsare currently being drilled and FMC equipment remains a hotseller. But few employees there -- mostly maintenanceconsultants -- or their families wanted out until the alliedbombing began to the north. Now, wives and children arebeginning to leave.   The employees' continued presence in the Persian Gulf areais valuable because they have private sources about thecondition of Kuwait's oil-production equipment -- some of italready damaged in the war. The U.S. military isn't providingmuch intelligence about Kuwait's oil fields, says JosephNetherland, vice president of FMC's petroleum machinerybusiness. He calculates the potential Kuwait market for FMC'soil-tanker loading machines at about 35 such devices,retailing for about $400,000 each.   Pricing of such equipment, often sold at discounts inrecent years, will likely get stronger world-wide if alliedbombs and an Iraqi scorched-earth retreat raise demand inKuwait. FMC officials are already looking forward to aseller's market for the first time in a decade.   That prospect has FMC planning to retool itsmining-equipment plant in Tupelo, Miss., to make oil-tankerloaders. &quot;A neat part of all this is the work it may bring tothe U.S.,&quot; says Mr. Netherland. Since the invasion, FMC hascanceled plans to close its Singapore oil-equipment plant andgear up to accelerate production there instead.   In addition to oil gear, FMC now possesses a long list ofnew equipment the Kuwaitis would need should they regaincontrol of their country.   For example, Kuwait City's fleet of a dozen or sostreet-sweepers has apparently been driven to Iraq. Kuwaitalready had 23 FMC-brand sweepers, priced at $80,000 each, onorder when the invasion occurred. Five sweepers were on afreighter just hours from their destination when Larry Brady,the executive vice president, discovered their location andordered the ship to turn around. Mr. Brady has sent theKuwait-bound sweepers to Mexico City as demonstration models.But the relatively-modest economy in Mexico makes it aless-likely customer than the spendthrift Kuwaitis -- if onlythey can be rid of Saddam Hussein.   The war is presenting a new market for sweepers in SaudiArabia -- which has ordered seven of them to clear runwaysfor allied aircraft. FMC is camouflaging them in desert-tancolor with its logo painted in flat black, rather than theusual white bodies with FMC's brand in bright red.   At FMC's defense plant in San Jose, meanwhile, apromotional videotape featuring snappy aerobics music showsthe Bradley blasting targets with a 25mm cannon that firesthree rounds per second. In the factory lobby, McRedmondMorelli, a finance major at nearby Santa Clara University, isturned down in his entrepreneurial quest to sellbright-colored Desert Shield T-shirts on the armored vehicleassembly line. Little does he know that FMC has alreadyprinted up sand-camouflage campaign shirts, caps and metalpins. The company store is selling out fast on thenewly-arrived plastic models of the Bradley vehicle, pricedat $6.50; one to a customer due to heavy demand.   Factory workers hurriedly repaint the green exterior partsof Bradleys -- previously destined for Europe -- to a desertcolor. Workers even repaint the shovels stored in the Bradleyto help troops dig it out of trouble. In the final inspectionarea, a poster shows Iraq's president through the cross hairsof the Bradley's cannon sights with the caption, &quot;Time toTake Your Medication, Saddam.&quot;   In the outplacement office to help laid-off weaponsworkers find jobs, only 10 of the 47 desks are in use. &quot;Neworders can keep this place quiet,&quot; says Mark Nechita,human-resources manager. FMC has indefinitely postponed about1,000 planned layoffs, due to the Army's recent request tokeep Bradleys coming off the line as fast as possible.   Morale is so high that Thomas Rabaut, a vice president inthe weapons operation, recently stood up to the sort ofoutside criticism he used to let slide. He was buyinggasoline for a company car when another customer at theservice station who spotted his car's FMC logo fussed aboutovercharging by defense contractors. &quot;I said, `How'd you liketo pay $10 a gallon for gas?' He didn't answer. A year ago Iwouldn't have done that,&quot; says Mr. Rabaut.   But the concern about defense-work quality runs deep withMr. Takacs, an FMC product manager who troubleshoots problemsin armored vehicles. He displays a photo of his son, William,an Army lieutenant in armor-tactics training at Fort Hood,Texas, who may soon command a Bradley unit in Saudi Arabia.&quot;William is our only child. So I have a vested interest inthis product,&quot; he says with a slight tremble.   ---                In the Eye of Desert Storm                                                                                                                           FMC Is Diversified... 1990 Revenue by business segment, in millions                                                                                                        Defense systems                          $1,062 Industrial chemicals                     $1,030 Machinery and equipment                  $  846 Performance chemicals                    $  594 Precious metals                          $  188</TEXT></DOC>
