Mel Levine said Thursday incalling for business-government consortia to re-establish Americanworld competitiveness.   ``As a result of foreign strategies successfully targeting thekey technologies and industries of the 1990s, America's industriallead is today threatened for the first time since Henry Fordinvented the modern assembly line,'' Levine told a House-Senatepanel.   The committee is exploring government-supported research andmanufacturing consortia that could help boost fledgling industriessuch as high-definition television.   ``American companies cannot compete individually against thisforeign targeting and will be increasingly forced to form consortiaas well as other cooperative ventures in order to regaintechnological and industrial parity,'' Levine said.   Once American companies have led in creating such consortia andpledged ``significant resources to these consortia, various forms ofgovernment assistance will often be necessary in order for theconsortia to succeed,'' he added.   The U.S. electronics industry, which was severely buffeted byforeign competition in the 1960s and 1970s, is seeking abillion-dollar program to help launch high-definition television,which promises snapshot-sharp images with a number of medical,educational, military and entertainment applications. HDTV couldrevitalize the ailing U.S. semiconductor industry as well.   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher is expected to propose toPresident Bush this summer a program of tax incentives and antitrustexemptions that would allow U.S. companies to join in HDTVmanufacturing consortia.   But Mosbacher has said these companies should not expect handoutsfrom ``Uncle Sugar.''   Levine, who chairs the Congressional HDTV Caucus and House ExportTask Force, took exception to the ``Uncle Sugar'' characterization.   He said ``high-tech consortia are being proposed by the mostsuccessful of our companies and industries. ... If the electronicsand other high tech industries seek government support today, it isnot because they need a handout, but because foreign targeting hasleft them with no choice.''   Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Joint Economic Committee,said the focus of the panel was to go beyond HDTV and semiconductorsto ``broader, longterm policy issues'' that would help foster astronger economy and improved competitive position.   Those concerns including whether foreign companies should beallowed into consortia receiving federal support and the proper rolefor the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in promotingcommercial revitalization.   DARPA Director Craig Fields told the panel that his agencyalready has a 30-year track record of successful government-industryresearch and development programs and that DARPA now was supporting300 companies.   He said Randamp;D is getting so expensive that few companies have theresources to go it alone. He said consortia can combine diverseskills and talents and save money by eliminating duplication ofeffort.   The question of how much foreign involvement should be allowedwas a tough problem to solve, Fields said, given the complex natureof today's multinational corporations.   He said the Defense Department does support foreign firms inprograms with U.S. allies, ``but we have not as yet significantlysupported foreign firms in the development of so-called dual usetechnology _ technology critical for defense and also central to thecivilian industrial base _ because we did not see a net gain for theU.S.''   Ralph E. Gomory, a former vice president at InternationalBusiness Machines Corp., said the problem is not conductingeffective research, which he said is a U.S. strong point, butapplying that research to production, as the Japanese have done sosuccessfully.</TEXT></DOC>
