L. 99-457, and to make programmatic changes in the regulations.These changes do not alter principal objectives or activities authorizedunder this authority, but rather clarify and support the central thrustof the program.On November 22, 1988, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemakingfor the Services for Deaf-Blind Children and Youth program in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (Volume No. 53, pages 47406-47410). The NPRMincluded a discussion of the following proposed major changes: (1) Provisionwas added for the support of extended school-year programs; (2) new, weightedcriteria were added for the evaluation of applications submitted underthis program; (3) provision was made for the national technical assistanceproviders, upon request from a andSection; 307.11 grantee or a State educationalagency, to extend technical assistance to other public and private agenciesand organizations that provide services to deaf-blind children and youth;(4) factors were established that the Secretary considers for determiningthe amount of awards for State and multi-State deaf-blind projects; (5)provision was made for the preparation of a coordinated plan for each deaf-blindchild and youth served; (6) provision was made for State and multi-Stateprojects to provide technical assistance to other public and private agenciesand organizations providing educational and related services to deaf-blindchildren and youth in addition to previous authority to provide technicalassistance to State educational agencies; (7) specific provision for supportof data analysis and dissemination activities was deleted; and (8) a requirementwas added that State and multi-State projects for deaf-blind children andyouth and technical assistance providers coordinate the provision of theirservices with other relevant service providers of deaf-blind children andyouth.A technical change has been made to andSection; 307.33(f)(2) to correct thereference in the NPRM to the State Operated or Supported Programs for HandicappedChildren Program under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary EducationAct of 1965.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes</ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, four parties submittedcomments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and ofthe changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows.Issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which theypertain.Section 307.4<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed concern that the addition tothe regulations at andSection; 307.4 of a definition of ``severely handicappedchildren and youth,'' might be interpreted as placing deaf-blind individualsinto that classification without adequate consideration of the widely varyinglevels of cognitive abilities of deaf-blind individuals.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The addition to the regulations of the definitionof severely handicapped children and youth is necessary to define the termused in andSection; 307.10(d), which makes provision for support of extendedschool year demonstration programs for this population. As defined, theterm includes not only those individuals with severe mental retardation,but also those persons, like the entire deaf-blind population, who havetwo or more serious handicapping conditions.<T3>Change: </T3>None.Section 307.10<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed concern that removal of provisionfor dissemination activities, formerly addressed under andSection;andSection;307.10(e) and 307.15 from the regulations signaled a perceived Departmentintent to no longer support those activities.<T3>Discussion: </T3>It was not the intent of the Secretary to discontinuesupport for dissemination activities under this program. Section 622(d)of the EHA requires the Secretary to disseminate materials and informationconcerning effective practices in working with deaf-blind children andyouth. The removal of dissemination activities from the regulations doesnot mean that the Secretary will no longer support these activities.<T3>Change: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed concern that adding extendedschool year demonstration programs to the list of authorized activitiesin andSection; 307.10 would decrease the funds available to pre-existingprogram initiatives.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Authorization to support extended school year demonstrationprojects was added to the program legislation at section 622(e) of theEHA by the EHA Amendments of 1986. The Secretary believes this change isneeded to implement congressional direction.<T3>Change: </T3>None.Section 307.11<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested changing the language of andSection;307.11(a)(1)(i), which discussed ``children and youth at risk of beingidentified as deaf-blind,'' to read: ``children and youth who, due to theirpresenting handicaps, need thorough diagnosis and evaluation in order todetermine the presence or absence of deaf-blindness'' because the existinglanguage carried deprecating implications to being identified as deaf-blind.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The language, ``children and youth at risk of beingcertified deaf-blind,'' is used in the statute. While sensitive to thecommenter's concern for any negative implications that might be seen inthis language, the Secretary has decided that the language in the regulationis necessary to include those children and youth whose age or severityof handicap might prohibit conclusive diagnosis and evaluation. No negativeconnotations are intended.<T3>Change: </T3>None.Section 307.12<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that technical assistance providedunder proposed andSection; 307.12 be made available only upon request ofthe State educational agency or a grantee funded under andSection; 307.11to other agencies, institutions, and organizations. A second commenterexpressed concern that States should have more control on decisions aboutthe amount and type of technical assistance given to them by the andSection;307.12 grantee.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The proposed regulations at andSection; 307.12(b) wereintended to require that technical assistance be provided at the requestof the State educational agency or grantee. The Secretary agrees that theregulations should have adequate controls to assure that the organizationrequesting technical assistance and the provider of the technical assistancereach concurrence on what is provided.<T3>Change: </T3>A change has been made to the program regulations at andSection;307.12(a) to clarify that the andSection; 307.12 grantee can provide technicalassistance in support of the activities authorized under andSection; 307.11.The proposed regulations at andSection; 307.12(b) have been modified, anda new paragraph andSection; 307.12(c) has been added to reflect the changessuggested.Section 307.15<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the deletion of andSection; 307.15,because he favored continued support for dissemination activities.<T3>Discussion: </T3>As discussed above in the material under andSection;307.10, section 622(d) of the EHA requires the Secretary to disseminatematerials and information concerning effective practices in working withdeaf-blind children and youth. The Secretary will continue to support disseminationactivities.<T3>Change: </T3>None.Section 307.31<T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters expressed general approval of the proposalin the notice of proposed rulemaking to create equity in allocation offunds among State and multi-State projects by identifying the factors tobe considered in funding decisions. Two of those commenters, however, raisedconcern that in the Secretary's consideration of the factors describedat proposed andSection; 307.31 (a)-(d) for determining the amount of an awardunder proposed andSection; 307.11, sufficient attention may not be givento certain States having small populations, limited resources, or lowerrelative costs for education. The third commenter suggested that therebe a three-year phasing in period for the adoption of this ``formula''so that shifts in funding levels occur gradually.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The factors identified at proposed andSection; 307.31will permit the Secretary sufficient flexibility to consider the uniqueneeds, resources, and costs of each applicant. The criteria used for determiningthe amount of awards are not part of a funding formula. Instead they providea flexible basis for determining funding levels based on multiple factors.Thus, no phase-in period is appropriate as this procedure is not a fixedformula for the award of funds.<T3>Change: </T3>None.Section 307.33<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended deleting andSection; 307.33(b)(2)which required consideration of the extent to which the applicant's planfor services and technical assistance implements current research and exemplarypractices including, among other things, provision of the maximum integrationof deaf-blind children and youth in the least restrictive environment.The commenter believed that deaf-blind children and youth should be servedin the environment appropriate to their needs.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The proposed regulations are intended to assure thatall deaf-blind children and youth be appropriately served by grantees underthis program, with all due consideration of their individual skills anddifferences. The proposed regulations do not preclude a grantee from servingthese children in any environment in which they are placed, but do preferapplications that implement current research and exemplary practices, includingthe education of handicapped children, including children in public orprivate institutions or other care facilities, to the maximum extent appropriatewith children who are not handicapped. It is the intention of the Secretarythat grants awarded under this program promote the upgrading and improvementof services to all deaf-blind children and youth, while encouraging theirplacement in the least restrictive environment appropriate to their needs.<T3>Change: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that experience in providingquality educational services to deaf-blind children and youth in leastrestrictive environments be deleted from proposed andSection; 307.33(c) asa criterion in the selection of key project personnel, as he did not believethis experience to be pertinent to serving all deaf-blind children andyouth.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The intent of the selection criteria in the proposedregulations was that experience in providing quality educational servicesto deaf-blind children and youth in least restrictive environments be representedwithin the key personnel of each project, rather than that all projectpersonnel be expected to have this experience.<T3>Change: </T3>The regulations of andSection; 307.33(c)(3) have been modifiedto clarify that experience in providing quality educational services todeaf-blind children and youth in the least restrictive environments appropriateto their needs be represented in the key project personnel.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed the need to specify and givea heavy weighting factor to evidence of the support of the State educationalagency of the State where services are proposed to be provided, in theprocedure identified in proposed andSection; 307.34 for selecting among twoor more applications for State or multi-State projects proposing to servethe same State.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that the support of the appropriateState educational agency, along with other agencies serving deaf-blindchildren and youth, is very important for the successful implementationof any State or multi-State deaf-blind project. The weight given the proposedcoordination factor (andSection; 307.33(f)) is sufficient to encourage effectivecoordination by grantees with relevant agencies.<T3>Change: </T3>The selection criteria at 34 CFR 307.33(f) have been modifiedto include consideration of evidence that an applicant will be able tocoordinate its activities with State educational agencies, in additionto other appropriate agencies within the State serving deaf-blind childrenand youth.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review</ITAG>This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 andthe regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective of the Executive Orderis to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalismby relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordinationand review of proposed Federal financial assistance.In accordance with the Order, this document is intended to provide earlynotification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Assessment of Educational Impact</ITAG>In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested commentson whether the proposed regulations would require transmission of informationthat is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authorityof the United States.Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, theDepartment has determined that the regulations in this document do notrequire transmission of information that is being gathered by or is availablefrom any other agency or authority of the United States.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 307</ITAG>Education, Education of handicapped, Education_research, Grants program_education,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Teachers.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lauro F.
