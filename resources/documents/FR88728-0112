Public review andcomment on the proposal were previously solicited through a notice in the<T4> Federal Register</T4>, Vol. 52, No. 199, Thursday, October 15, 1987.As a result of widespread interest and comment on the proposal, it hasbeen modified and revised, particularly in the areas of: (1) Annual indexingto adjust for changes in the economy; (2) phasing in the larger fee increasesto recognize the substantial impact of implementing the new system; (3)identifying and recognizing the role of amateur radio repeater systems;(4) further refining the fee schedule for TV and FM radio translators servingvery small rural communities; and, (5) identifying that FCC licensees,not licenses or ``boxes'', will be the basis for TV translator fees. The proposal is now being resubmitted for comment. Comments on the originalpublication will be further considered prior to any decision and need notbe resubmitted. This proposal is based on a market study conducted by the Region duringthe spring and summer of 1987. The market study is available for reviewand comment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE:</T2> Comments must be received, in writing, by September 26,1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS:</T2> Send comments on the current proposal to J.

The existing policy for determining annualland use rental fees is a mixture of schedule and formula. Fees are basedon 0.2 percent of the authorization holder's total investment value forcommunication facilities and equipment plus 5 percent of the rental incomefrom building tenants and/or equipment user served by the holder. Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) states that ``TheSecretary of Agriculture, with respect to lands within the National ForestSystem, is authorized to grant, issue, or renew rights-of-way over, upon,under, or through such lands for systems for the transmission or receptionof radio, television, telephone, telegraph, and other electronic signalsand other means of communications'' provided that ``the holder of suchright-of-way shall pay annually in advance the fair market value of suchright-of-way as determined by the Secretary.'' Secretary of Agriculture Regulations 36 CFR 251.57 promulgated to implementFLPMA state that ``The fee will be based upon the fair market value ofthe rights and privileges authorized as determined by appraisal or othersound business management principles.'' It has been determined that thefee system which has been in use does not satisfy this requirement. A newpolicy was developed on October 4, 1985 (50 FR 40574) which broadened themethods of determining annual land use rental fees for communication usesand allowed the Chief or Regional Foresters to determine which of threemethods (site specific appraisal, competitive bidding, or Regional feeschedule) is appropriate for particular geographic areas. In keeping with this direction the Regional Forester for the IntermountainRegion has determined that: 1. A fee schedule would be an appropriate cost effective method to useto assess fees for most communication uses. This schedule is intended tocover the majority of uses on existing and proposed sites in the IntermountainRegion. 2. Fees for atypical or unique sites/ uses or sites/uses serving high populationare not covered by this schedule. The authorized officer may use site specificappraisals, sound business management principles, and/or rental analysisto determine fees for individual sites/uses when market evidence, suchas leases for similar uses, demonstrates the inapplicability of the schedule.Examples of sites which may fit these situations are Shafer Butte and DeerPoint in Idaho and Slid Mountain in Nevada. Appraisals provided by the holder or other users may be used to determinefees if the Regional Review Appraiser establishes that the appraisal meetsForest Service standards and the fee represents fair market value. 3. Competitive bidding may be used to establish fees for new sites or undevelopedportions of existing sites. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments on October 15, 1987, Proposal </ITAG>In addition to publication in the October 15, 1987,<T4> Federal Register,</T4> copies of the proposal were mailed to all holders,and other interested parties such as key state and Federal officials, andthe news media. News releases were provided throughout the IntermountainRegion. These contacts were for the purpose of inviting comments on theproposal.There were 326 written responses received. The majority came from addressesin Utah (41 percent) and Idaho (39 percent). Respondents fit into threecategories of use: amateur radio users comprised 37 percent of the responses;commercial communicators, their clients, and other 2-way radio repeaterusers comprised 33 percent of the responses; and TV translators comprised26 percent of the responses.While virtually all responses were opposed to the fee schedule proposal,many agreed that a change in the fee system was needed and that increaseswere inevitable. The primary reason for opposing the fee schedule was thatrespondents felt the market survey was biased which resulted in proposedfee levels which appeared higher than fair market value. As a result ofthe public comment, we reviewed the initial study data, and compared itwith additional data provided by neighboring Forest Service Regions. Wealso investigated data provided by several users. Unfortunately, transactioninformation provided by users was often difficult to compare with an annualfee because it involved donations, purchases, and barter, rather than leases/rentals.Numerous respondents, predominantly commercial communicators and thosein the broadcast industry, questioned whether the data and resultant feeschedule proposal reflected investments by the lessees in site development,such as road access and electrical power. Our market survey analyzed factorssuch as investments by the lessee and concluded that they were not fee-determiningin the private market. Reasons for this are not absolute, but perhaps otherfactors (elevation, topography, population served) influence the valueof the site, and development costs are absorbed with other operations costs(buildings, equipment) as an initial capital expense.We believe that the proposed fee schedule is proper, fair, and equitable.It is based on a comprehensive market survey utilizing the best data available.The fee schedule represents the market value for various uses today. However,we recognize that it would not be a sound business decision to immediatelyrequire full payment when a change in fee structure results in large increases.Therefore, we propose a phase-in under the following conditions: (1) Wherethe new fee schedule results in a fee increase of more than 100 percent,but less than $2,000, the increase in excess of 100 percent will be phasedin over a 3-year period; or (2) Where the increase exceeds 100 percentand $2,000, the increase in excess of 100 percent will be phased in overa 5-year period.There were some objections to the proposal to make annual adjustments byuse of an index, and some objected to the Implicit Price Deflator (IPD)as the index of choice. Annual indexing is common in the private marketas a means of staying current with the economy. We disagree with thosewho commented that indexing itself causes inflation and we continue topropose the annual indexing provision. However, we have changed the indexto the Consumer Price Index-Urban (CPI-U) because our review indicatesit is the most commonly used index for communication site leases in theprivate market.Many respondents urged that the fees, if otherwise properly establishedand calculated, should not be imposed on certain types of use. The majorityof respondents claimed that their type of use is in the public interest,provides a valuable public benefit, and therefore should be exempt fromfees. These included amateur (``ham'') radio operators and organizations;public radio and television broadcasters (PBS); Federal, state, county,and municipal government agencies; and a variety of non-profit organizations.The relationship of this fee schedule to the provisions for waiver of feesis discussed in the ``Fee Waivers'' section of this announcement.Amateur radio operators also claimed it was unfair to include them in abroad category covering all 2-way radio use. We have reviewed our marketsurvey, discussed license procedures with the Federal Communications Commission(FCC), and determined that amateur radio use is an independent category.The market survey indicates that this category of use is not refined anda fee cannot be determined using this procedure. Therefore, other soundbusiness management principles indicate that an annual rental fee of $75is appropriate when no other specific market data is available. This takesinto consideration that there is some minimum benefit or value for theuse of public land, and that such minimum value represents the cost tothe Forest Service for authorizing and administering the use.Input from viewers and broadcasters alike (26 percent of responses) opposedthe proposed rate structure for TV translators. Most objected that TV serviceto isolated rural communities would be threatened. Broadcasters assertedthat the limited viewing audiences served by most of these translatorsdo not affect advertising rates and resultant revenues; therefore, it wouldnot be economical to continue service if the proposed fee schedule wereapplied. Nonprofit community TV translator associations argued that somesparsely populated areas claimed they operate on such limited budgets thatthe proposed schedule would effectively double their costs and thus curtailthe operation. County-operated translator groups and systems in Utah arguedthe need to continue providing TV reception as a necessary public service,and that the proposed fees, especially if applied to each translator inuse, would severely threaten the continuation of this traditionally ``free''use of the National Forest communication sites.We have reviewed our data for TV translators and determined that thereis no basis to charge a separate fee for each translator at a given siteowned and operated by a single FCC licensee. Translators owned and operatedby a single FCC licensee is an authorized facility will be assessed a singlefee for the operations. Additionally, expanding on the principle that thevalue of this type of use is related to the population served by it, wehave extended and interpolated the analysis of available data to the populationcategory of 0-6000. This results in fee increments of $75 per 1000 peoplein the under-6000 population category.In addition to the publication, mailing, and news releases concerning theproposal, and the 326 written responses that resulted, numerous meetingshave been held with communication industry representatives and interests.Their input and recommendations have been considered.In summary, based on the information and responses received during thepublic comment period, we have made significant changes and adjustmentsfrom our October 1987 proposal. These include: (1) Use of the ConsumerPrice Index-Urban (CPI-U) rather than the Implicit Price Deflator (IPD)as the index upon which to base annual adjustments; (2) use of a 3- or5-year fee phase-in period, based on the amount of fee increase; (3) establishmentof the fee for amateur radio repeaters at $75.00; (4) considering all TVtranslators at a given site operated by the same FCC licensee a singleuse; and (5) refining the fee for the low population bracket of TV translatoroperations into smaller increments, at $75 per 1,000 people.Additionally, in response to questions and comments indicating confusionas to how the proposed fee schedule would be applied to certain situations,we have expanded the definitions and discussions of types of uses, andotherwise attempted to clarify and explain the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rental Fee Schedule</ITAG>The proposed rental fee schedule has been prepared based on: (1) Analysisof market data of similar uses in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho,Montana, North Dakota, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, andWyoming, and (2) sound business management principles. The proposed rentalfee schedule for the Intermountain Region appears at the end of this notice.The proposed schedule establishes annual rental fees by type of communicationuse (as listed in the ``Discussion of Communication Use Types'' sectionof this notice) and by population categories for the Intermountain Region.<ITAG tagnum="84">Shared space</ITAG>To improve administration of communication sites, Forest Service policy(50 FR 40574, October 4, 1985) provides for authorizing shared facilitiesunder a single authorization. Under the conditions of these authorizations,holders, rather than the Forest Service, authorize the use of their facilitiesby others. Payment of Forest Service fees and performance of certain administrativeduties required under this type of authorization are responsibilities ofthe holder.The Authorized Officer may, when determined beneficial to do so, negotiatea fee discount based on an objective estimate of the benefits receivedby the Forest Service. Benefits may consider costs incurred by the holderto administer the uses plus a reasonable profit. Negotiated fees will bebased on 100 percent of the scheduled fee for the highest value use allowedunder the holder's authorization, plus at least 50 percent of the scheduledfee for each additional use allowed under the holder's authorization. Consolidationof facilities on a site may meet the objectives of the Forest Service.In these cases, the Authorized Officer may negotiate a temporary discountin fees to encourage consolidation. Fee discounts cannot exceed the holder'scost to consolidate the facilities. In no case will fees be discountedfor costs incurred by the holder to meet the conditions of the authorization(maintenance, safety requirements, etc.).<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous Communication Uses</ITAG>A review of Forest Service records discloses a number of authorized communicationuses for which the market analysis provided insufficient information onmarket rent. Many of these are for personal/private uses and involve ``receiveonly'' equipment, such as TV and radio receiving antennas, satellite dishes,and other equipment or structures designed solely for the reception ofelectromagnetic signals. Some uses may be ``transmit only'', such as naturalresource or environmental monitoring telemetry. Some miscellaneous usesmay invlove both transmitting and receiving equipment and structures.There are comparatively few of these installations in the IntermountainRegion. Fair market value can be established through sound business managementprinciples as provided in Secretary of Agriculture's Regulation 36 CFR251.57a. The Intermountain Region has reviewed available information andthe market analysis for other communication uses as listed in the proposedrental fee schedule and concluded that an appropriate annual fee for thevarious miscellaneous communication uses not otherwise identified in theproposed fee schedule is $75 per year per unit. A unit is defined as onereceiving antenna, one transmit/receive antenna combination serving oneradio, one satellite dish, etc.The field of communications is expanding rapidly. Many communication usesare in developmental stages. The Intermountain Region's proposed rentalfee schedule is not intended to include these new and developing uses.Fees will be established on the basis of appraisal, sound business managementprinciples, and/or negotiation when these new and developing uses becomeoperational in the Intermountain Region.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fee Waivers</ITAG>Under certain qualifying circumstances, as provided by Secretary of Agriculture'sRegulations 36 CFR 251.57b and current Forest Service policy, fees maybe fully or partially waived. These procedures are not affected by theproposed fee schedule.Numerous comments on the earlier proposal urged the Chief or the RegionalForester to establish a ``blanket'' waiver throughout the Service or Regionfor certain categories of uses. The decision to authorize fee waivers isdelegated to the Forest Officer who issues the special use authorization.We believe the determination of whether a fee waiver in a given situationis equitable and in the public interest can best be made at the local level.In no case, except for a use by another Federal agency, or cases involvinga reciprocal agreement with a State or local government agency, shoulda fee waiver result in less than $75 for a communication use. <ITAG tagnum="84">Annual Fee Schedule Adjustment </ITAG>All categories of use are subject to an annual fee adjustment. The U.S.Department of Labor Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)for July of the current year will be divided by the CPI-U for July of theprevious year to yield a CPI-U multiplier which will be used to annuallyupdate the Communication Fee Schedule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Periodic Review of Fee Schedule </ITAG>The Forest Service recognizes the need for granting reasonable securityto its holders and for protecting the public's interest by providing forthe adjustment of fees when the value of the use authorized or the operationsof the holders clearly indicate that a fee change is justified. To ensurethis mutual protection, the Region shall, by September 1, 1994, reviewthe existing schedule to determine whether market conditions and businesspractices have changed sufficiently to warrant a schedule revision. Holderswill be given an opportunity to provide data which will be considered duringthe review. Fee adjustments, if appropriate, will be announced to holdersat least 90 days before becoming effective on January 1, 1995. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Implementation, With Phase-In </ITAG>Fees proposed according to this schedule will apply to each communicationuse on National Forest System lands in the Intermountain Region upon adoptionof the final schedule and publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The new fees would be effective beginning January1, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Provisions for phase-in of fee increases follow: 1. If the increase in the annual rental is less than 100 percent, therewill be no phase-in. 2. If the increase in the annual rental exceeds 100 percent, but the <T3>fee increase is less than $2,000, </T3>the amount of the new rentalin excess of the 100 percent increase would be phased-in by equal increments,plus the annual adjustment, over a 3-year period. 3. If the increase in annual rental exceeds 100 percent and the <T3>fee increase is more than $2,000, </T3>the amount of the new rentalin excess of the 100 percent increase would be phased-in by equal increments,plus the annual adjustment, over a 5-year period. Copies of this notice and the proposed fee schedule are being mailed toholders of existing communication site authorizations and to anyone requestingcopies from the contacts listed in this notice. The market study and proposedrental fee schedule are also available for review at Forest Supervisor'sOffices. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Communication Use Types </ITAG><T3>Appurtenant Uses. </T3>Except for Commercial Communicators, appurtenantuses will not be assessed additional fees. Subsidiary firms are consideredautonomous and do not qualify for an appurtenant use fee exemption. <T3>Passive Reflector. </T3>This use includes various types of nonpoweredreflector devices used to bend or ricochet electronic signals between activerelay stations or between an active station and terminal. Passive reflectorsrequire point-to-point, line-of-sight linking with connecting relay stations,but do not require electric power. Maintenance is minimal and reflectorsites seldom require visitation. An annual rental fee rate of $600 is proposed.<T3>Broadcast Translator. </T3>This use consists of receiving a televisionor FM radio broadcast signal and rebroadcasting it on a different channelor frequency for local reception. In some cases the translator relays thesignal to another booster or translator. This category of use includestranslators associated with public telecommunications service. Market datafor small community and individual translators was inconclusive for populationsbelow 6,000; therefore, we extended and interpolated the analysis of availabledata to small populations, resulting in fee increments of $75 per 1,000people served. Multiple translators operated by a single FCC licensee ata site are considered as one use. Nine population-dependent annual rentalfee rates are proposed. <T3>Internal 2-Way Radio Repeater. </T3>This use includes two-way radiorepeaters for the purpose of internal communications in support of business,community activities, or other organizational objectives. The communicationservice is not sold and is limited to the user. Fees for this categorywill be based on the nubmer of frequencies licensed by the Federal CommunicationsCommission (FCC) or the number of installed transceivers, whichever isleast. Three population-dependent annual rental rates are proposed. <T3>Industrial Microwave. </T3>This use includes entities who are not inthe communications business, but have their own internal microwave communicationssystems or networks. Users in this group may include pipeline and powercompanies, railroads, and land resource management agencies or firms. Thecommunication service is not sold and is limited to the user. Fees forthis category will be based on the number of frequencies licensed by theFederal Communications Commission (FCC) or the number of installed transceivers,whichever is least. Two population-dependent annual rental rates are proposed.<T3>Cable and Subscription Television.</T3> This use includes cable TVhead-end antenna or satellite dish receivers used for community televisionpickups which retransmit by cable or any other means whereby subscriberspay periodic fees to receive the signal. These systems normally operateas a commercial entity within an authorized franchise area. Three population-dependentannual rental fee rates are proposed.<T3>Common Carrier Microwave Relay.</T3> This use typically includes longlinecarriers who relay intra- and interstate telephone, television, information,and data transmissions using point-to-point microwave networks or systems.The users are regulated by State Public Utility Commissions and must provideservice to any consumer with the ability to pay according to a publishedrate schedule. Fees for this category will be based on the number of frequencieslicensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or the number ofinstalled transceivers, whichever is least. Two population-dependent annualrental rates are proposed.<T3>Commercial Communicator.</T3> This category includes users whose primarybusiness ir providing communications services to others. The user holdsan FCC license and may own a building or vault and lease space to othersor may lease building and vault space from others. Typically the user isalso a facility manager. Examples of such use include 800-trunking andSpecial Mobile Radios (SMR's). Fees for this category will be based ontransmit frequencies. A rate proposal of $700 for the first transmit frequencyis proposed, plus $200 for each additional transmit frequency. Tenantsof commercial communicators will be considered separately under other feeschedule categories.<T3>Radio Broadcast.</T3> This use includes FCC authorized facilities thatbroadcast AM and FM audio signals for general public reception. Users includeradio stations which generate revenues from commercial advertising, andpublic radio stations whose revenues are supported by subscriptions, grants,donations, and appropriations. It relates only to primary transmittersand not any rebroadcast systems such as translators. Appurtenant uses authorizedunder this use relate to microwave and/or 2-way radio links from a permittedsite to studio or other fixed or mobile units directly related to the broadcastactivity. Four population-dependent rates are proposed.<T3>Television Broadcast.</T3> This category includes FCC authorized facilitiesthat broadcast VHF and UHF audio and video signals for general public reception.Users include television stations (major and independent networks) thatgenerate revenues from commercial advertising, and public television stationswhose revenues are supported by subscriptions, grants, donations, or appropriations.It relates only to primary transmitters and not any rebroadcast systemssuch as translators. Appurtenant uses authorized under this use relateto microwave and/or 2-way radio links from a permitted site to studio orother fixed or mobile units directly related to the broadcast activity.Four population-dependent rates are proposed.<T3>Personal/Private ``Receive Only.''</T3> This use includes radio andTV receiving antennas, satellite dishes, and other equipment/facilitiesdesigned for the reception of electromagnetic signals serving private homesand recreation residences. The equipment is personally owned; not operatedfor profit. As one of the miscellaneous electronic uses discussed earlier,a flat rate of $75 is established based on sound business management principlesand is not subject to waiver.<T3>Amateur Radio Service.</T3> This use includes repeaters used by individualsor groups who are licensed by the FCC as amateur radio operators. Privatemarket leases are inconclusive. Therefore, a flat rate of $75 is establishedbased on sound business management principles and is not subject to waiver.<T3>Natural Resource and Environmental Monitoring.</T3> This use includesthe trnasmission of telemetry data from a remote site to a central receivingstation. As one of the miscellaneous electronic uses discussed earlier,a flat rate of $75 is established based on sound business management principlesand is not subject to waiver.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 6, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">T.A.
