PRESIDENT ROH IS OPTIMISTIC                                                                                                          South Korean President Roh Tae Woo said in a New Year'smessage that he expects relations between the hostile Koreasto improve during 1991 and that he looks forward to a unifiedpeninsula by the end of the century. He said the breakdown ofcommunism in the Soviet Union and East Europe and thosenations' new relations with pro-Western South Korea wouldforce the communist North to alter its rigid, totalitarianviews. &quot;It would be untenable for North Korea to remainunchanged for long,&quot; Mr. Roh said.                                                                                                          SPAIN'S ELECTRICITY RATES GO UP                                                                                                          Spain's electricity rates were increased 6.8%, effectiveyesterday. It was the first increase in electricity pricesover the rate of inflation since 1986, when rates were lifted7.2%. The increase was calculated to cover rising energycosts; those costs are expected to hit hard in Spain, whichis dependent on oil imports. Between 1986 and 1991, increasesin electricity prices remained below inflation; electricitycharges increased 5.5% in 1990. Spain's annualized inflationcurrently stands at 6.7%.                                                                                                          WORLD AIR TRAFFIC UP LAST YEAR                                                                                                          The International Civil Aviation Organization said worldairline passenger traffic rose an estimated 5.8% in 1990 to1.171 trillion revenue passenger miles from 1.107 trillionrevenue passenger miles in 1989. The organization saidairlines carried 1.16 billion passengers in 1990 comparedwith 1.12 billion in 1989. Airlines carried 281 millionpassengers on international flights in 1990 compared with 262million the year before.                                                                                                          GERMAN PLAN FOR JUNK CARS                                                                                                          German Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer plans to requireautomobile makers to take back junk cars and dispose of themas of the start of 1994, according to a report in a regionalpaper. Mr. Toepfer will introduce the proposal to the Germancabinet at the start of the new year, the WestdeutscheAllgemeine Zeitung reported. If car makers are unwilling tomeet the proposed goal voluntarily, Mr. Toepfer is preparedto adopt the necessary regulations, the paper said.                                                                                                          CHINA'S GOAL                                                                                                          China's President Yang Shangkun reaffirmed hisgovernment's goal of doubling the country's gross nationalproduct in the new decade. &quot;I am fully confident in therealization of this goal,&quot; Mr. Yang said in New Year'sgreetings over Radio Beijing. Senior leader Deng Xiaopingfirst set China the challenge back in 1978 of quadrupling itsGNP by the year 2000. It surpassed the halfway mark in thebooming 1980s; and economists say that even with moderategrowth, China's GNP should reach the goal of 2.8 trillionyuan ($538 billion) by the century's end.                                                                                                          HONG KONG HOTEL GLUT                                                                                                          In the freshest evidence of Hong Kong's hotel glut, theHong Kong Tourist Association reported that occupancy levelsfor topline hotels slumped to 74% in last year's first 11months from 78% a year earlier.   The level is far below the 90% recorded inJanuary-November 1988. That was before the British colony'shotel industry was walloped by the sharp fall in tourismafter China's suppression of the pro-democracy movement inJune 1989 and a major building boom in new four- andfive-star properties.   The average occupancy rate for all Hong Kong hotelsslipped to 79% in the first 11 months from 80% a year earlierand 92% in the same period of 1988.   The top-line hotels category covers 16 leading hotels inthe colony; 72 properties are included in the overall survey.
