Mr. Walshjust &quot;won&quot; a plea bargain with one CIA official, and in theprocess helped to delay the hearings for director-nomineeRobert Gates.   We use quotes around won because last week's plea bargainwith Alan Fiers, Jr., raises more questions than it answers.It's somehow fitting that Mr. Walsh got Mr. Fiers to pleadguilty to the crime of refusing to testify. That was one ofJoe McCarthy's favorite rubber hoses, which he and hisfollowers used against people such as Pete Seeger andHollywood's Dalton Trumbo. Different times, differentpolitical targets.</LP><TEXT>   Various news reports credit Mr. Walsh with getting Mr.Fiers to admit perjury or withholding information ormisleading Congress, but this is inaccurate. Instead, Mr.Fiers agreed to say he violated 2 U.S. Code Section 192,which penalizes failing to appear before Congress. Witnessesmust appear and answer &quot;pertinent&quot; questions; other crimes,to which Mr. Fiers did not admit, deal with perjury andcontempt of Congress.   This plea bargain is bizarre because everyone agrees thatMr. Fiers did appear before Congress when he was called totestify. Nor has anyone cited any pertinent question he has&quot;refused&quot; to answer. Rather, Mr. Walsh says he gaveincomplete information about what he knew (and when) aboutU.S. aid for the Contras. Even Joe McCarthy never tried toconvict anyone of not telling Congress what it wanted to knowbut was too dense to ask.   What apparently happened was that when Mr. Fiers refusedto admit to perjury or any other felony, Mr. Walsh was onlytoo happy to accept a misdemeanor plea to an act Mr. Fiersdid not commit. Mr. Fiers can hardly be faulted for copping afalse plea. Most career government officials (indeed, mostAmerican citizens) don't have millions of dollars set asideto defend themselves in a federal trial.   This episode is independent counsel deja vu. Mr. Walsh'sfirst prosecution ended in 1987 when he got Contrafundraisers Spitz Channell and Richard Miller to plead guiltyto violating the tax rules for charities. The JusticeDepartment and IRS later denied that their actions werecrimes. In 1988, Mr. Walsh got Robert McFarlane to plead to acharge similar to Mr. Fiers's. &quot;He just pleaded guilty to nottelling Congress everything it wanted to know,&quot; PresidentReagan said at the time. &quot;I've done that myself.&quot; It's hardlya crime.   Mr. Walsh's real purpose in the plea, we deduce, is tokeep his prosecutorial office going. &quot;It is not a matter ofmy judgment anymore as to how long things will go on,&quot; Mr.Walsh told the New York Times. Despite the reversals, he cankeep himself occupied and in headlines and, we will be crassenough to add, keep the open-ended fees rolling in.   At some point, though, Mr. Walsh is likely to bite offmore than his congressional masters can chew. If he pressesahead with charges of &quot;misleading&quot; Congress he may run intomore defendants, such as Ollie North and John Poindexter, whoinsist on winning in the courts. If so, their lawyers arelikely to notice that misleading requires that someone wasmisled. The defense will ask what particular congressmen knewand when did they know it.   We look foward to this testimony. The on-again, off-againBoland amendments were a political bargain that assumed thatWhite House officials would do what they could to keep theContras alive. Mr. Walsh has failed to demonstrate that theseefforts were illegal. Presumably he himself doubts that anylaw prohibited the aid White House officials managed to getto the Contras, or he wouldn't bother with the crime of&quot;misleading&quot; Congress. Yet in fact, there were newspaperaccounts throughout the mid-1980s about the role of OliverNorth and others. Some congressmen may have pretended not toknow anything, but getting discovery about what they knew andwhen would be highly educational.   As a constitutional matter, executive-branch officialssuch as Mr. Fiers are under no obligation to answer everyquestion asked by Congress, even laying aside public sessionsabout confidential intelligence operations. The FoundingFathers stressed that the executive branch of governmentrequires secrecy to carry out foreign policy. Just as thepresident is not entitled to know everything that goes onbetween a congressman and his staff, Congress has no right toall information about internal presidential operations.   This plea to a crime Mr. Fiers did not commit is anotherattack on the rule of law by an uncontrolled prosecutor. Longafter the details of Iran-Contra are relegated to footnotes,Mr. Walsh could still be out there, coercing pleas and makingup law as he goes along. Maybe what the country needs is anAttorney General with the courage of Arnold Schwarzenegger tostop the mindless Walsh terminator once and for all.</TEXT></DOC>
