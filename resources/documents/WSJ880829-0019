<DOC><DOCNO> WSJ880829-0019 </DOCNO><HL> Business Brief: Entertainment Publications Inc. </HL><SO> </SO><CO> EPUB </CO><TEXT>   Entertainment Publications Inc., Birmingham, Mich., said it will propose to shareholders a recapitalization plan that would offer holders $16 a share in cash plus one share in a new, publicly traded holding company for each common share.    The offer has a cash value of $77 million, not including the value of stock in the new holding company, a spokesman for the publisher of discount coupon books said. Financing is being provided by &quot;a financial institution&quot; that the company didn't identify.    As part of the recapitalization, company management would benefit from a three-part incentive program.    Entertainment Publications management has tried twice in the past year to take the company private. The first try was abandoned after the Oct. 19 stock market crash. The latest attempt, a $23-a-share cash and stock buy-out proposed in May, was scrapped in July for undisclosed reasons.    The company's shares closed Friday at $22.75, up 75 cents, in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
