Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FGRP BTI </CO><IN> TNM INS </IN><TEXT>   The plans B.A.T Industries PLC has for expanding its presence in the U.S. financial services industry focus on internal growth at Farmers Group Inc.    Los Angeles-based Farmers, the nation's third-largest issuer of automobile and homeowners insurance, gave up its eight-month battle to remain independent late Wednesday when it agreed to be acquired by B.A.T for $75 a share, or a total of $5.2 billion.    &quot;Farmers has significant opportunities for organic growth,&quot; B.A.T Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in an interview. He didn't identify any specific plans that the British tobacco, retailing, paper and financial services concern has for Farmers, saying that &quot;those plans would be their plans.&quot;    But before B.A.T considers expanding Farmers it must first digest its acquisition, which Mr. Sheehy said will bring &quot;an insignificant dilution, or possibly none at all&quot; to B.A.T earnings next year. The executive's current thoughts about using the Farmers acquisition as a springboard for gobbling up other U.S. financial services businesses? &quot;Not for a while, for heaven sakes,&quot; Mr. Sheehy said.    Farmers shares closed yesterday at $70, up 75 cents, in national over-the-counter trading of nearly five million shares. The discount below B.A.T's price indicates that traders believe it still may take several months to obtain all regulatory approvals for the acquisition.    Mr. Sheehy described Farmers' early concerns over a B.A.T acquisition -- about the insurance company's ability to market nonsmoker insurance discounts aggressively and about B.A.T's presence in South Africa -- as not playing a part in what he called the &quot;cordial&quot; negotiations. Farmers had raised the smoking and South Africa issues in a campaign to thwart B.A.T's bid for approval among the insurance regulators in the nine states that must approve its bid. Three states rejected the bid, although now that the deal has turned friendly they are expected to approve it.    Industry analysts said Farmers' defensive strategy, building a bulwark based on the regulatory hurdles, worked well despite the company's eventual decision to forgo independence.    &quot;One thing we learned from this is that insurance companies are tougher to buy because of the regulatory obstacles,&quot; said Gerald Lewinsohn, an insurance industry analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;I think B.A.T is sufficiently mercenary that they wouldn't have paid Farmers $1 billion more if they thought they could get past the regulators.&quot; B.A.T initially approached Farmers with a $60-a-share takeover offer in January, with a total value of $4.2 billion.    Farmers' chances of success would have been &quot;fairly decent&quot; had its suitor refused to bid higher, he said. &quot;What it ultimately took was cold, hard cash.&quot;    In Mr. Lewinsohn's view, &quot;The management of Farmers emotionally and philosophically was opposed to being taken over. But when push came to shove, the stockholders were breathing down their necks.&quot; Directors, he said, &quot;didn't want to spend the next year in court&quot; fighting shareholder lawsuits based on a company rejection of the higher offer.    Mr. Sheehy maintained in the interview that if the acquisition is completed by year-end, B.A.T's debt-to-equity ratio -- currently at 34% -- won't exceed 70%. Financing for the acquisition will come from internal funds and a $3.2 billion credit facility that B.A.T arranged after its overture in January.    And in a change from its earlier stand, B.A.T, which had previously said it might assign $1.6 billion of the acquisition debt to Farmers, said no acquisition debt will be assigned to the company.    Leo E. Denlea Jr., Farmers' chairman, said he believes Farmers &quot;will operate fairly much as it has in the past,&quot; noting that the insurance company is &quot;nothing like B.A.T already has.&quot; He said talks with Mr. Sheehy about the future were only &quot;cursory, preliminary&quot; discussions, and didn't delve much into the area of expansion. The two agreed to meet later to discuss growth, Mr. Denlea said.    But the Farmers executive, who said he has &quot;no plans to leave&quot; the company, added that he is &quot;optimistic for our growth opportunities for the future.&quot; He noted that Farmers already is looking to add Southeastern states, starting with Tennessee, to a current 26-state area concentrated in the West and Midwest.    Mr. Denlea said B.A.T's major concern in the past week's negotiations was that employees and agents &quot;would be in a positive frame of mind about the acquisition&quot; by the British conglomerate. Mr. Denlea said he would try to calm any fears, among his other duties. &quot;So long as I can be effective, I will help Farmers in any way, shape or form,&quot; he said.    Mr. Sheehy, too, was quick to begin patching up wounds from the often-acrimonious takeover struggle. &quot;Now that the heat of battle is over, we have established a trusting relationship,&quot; he said. &quot;I respect them for fighting for their independence. They got a good value for their shareholders for doing so.&quot;    After Farmers directors quickly rejected B.A.T's $60-a-share offer, B.A.T launched a hostile $63-a-share tender offer in March. B.A.T had said all along it was willing to increase its price if Farmers would negotiate a takeover. But Farmers officials refused to meet with B.A.T until earlier this month, when the British concern offered to pay $72 a share in a negotiated takeover.    Mr. Sheehy said the &quot;turning point&quot; for B.A.T in its decision to raise the bid to $72 a share was a critical Aug. 5 ruling in California state court that ordered California's insurance commissioner to reverse her earlier ruling against the offer.    The success of B.A.T isn't likely to set off a spate of insurance-industry acquistions by other non-insurance concerns. Industry analysts say that Farmers is &quot;unique&quot; in the insurance industry because of its uninterrupted earnings growth and its relationship with the three insurance exchanges it manages. Farmers sells property-casualty policies issued by the exchanges, which are owned by their policyholders who bear the risk of loss. This limit on Farmers' exposure makes the company especially attractive to an acquirer.    Farmers' relationship with its exchanges was a major bargaining point in its closed-door negotiations with B.A.T this past week, Mr. Sheehy said.    &quot;They weren't sure if we were fully aware and recognized the role of the exchanges,&quot; Mr. Sheehy said. The acquisition agreement preserves the independence of the exchanges. </TEXT></DOC>
