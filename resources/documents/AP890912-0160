The Democratic-sponsored bill was passed 380 to 38 and sent tothe Senate, which plans action next month.   The lopsided tally came after Speaker Thomas S. Foley promised avote later on a constitutional amendment, the remedy demanded byPresident Bush and many congressional Republicans to undo thecourt's ruling that flag burning could be a protected form of freespeech.   ``I remain opposed ... and I think the leadership is opposed to aconstitutional amendment,'' said Foley, D-Wash., calling such actionunnecessary tampering with the Bill of Rights.   However, he said he had assured those seeking an amendment theywould get their vote, and he denied that that marked a politicalsetback. He suggested he would work to keep the amendment fromgetting the two-thirds vote needed for passage.   Some seeking an amendment softened their opposition to thestatute, once assured that the Democratic leadership would not useit to block their alternative.   Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House VeteransCommittee and co-sponsor of Bush's amendment, stood up in the Houseand announced he would vote for the statute.   ``I still have doubts that we can do the job by statute, but thisis a step in the right direction,'' he said.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We believethat this bill is insufficient to provide the protections that weseek, and therefore continue to press for a constitutionalamendment.''   But he stopped short of any veto threat, thus heling the HouseDemocrats garner support for the statute.   Conservative Republicans, however, continued to accuse theDemocrats of trying to sidetrack the constitutional amendment whilepushing a statute the GOP lawmakers contend may still beunconstitutional.   ``The game is obvious,'' said Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H. ``Thisis the flag burner protection act of 1989.''   The statute, a version of which is expected to come before theSenate in early October, includes criminal penalties of up to a yearin jail plus an unspecified fine for flag burning or othermutilation.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell has promised a vote on theconstitutional amendment later next month, and Foley said Tuesdaythat House action would follow the Senate's.   Both the statute and the constitutional amendment are attempts toaddress a Supreme Court ruling in June that threw out the convictionof a man who burned a flag at the 1984 Republican NationalConvention in Dallas.   The court held that the law was unconstitutional because it wasaimed at suppressing the man's right to political expression asguaranteed by the Constitution.   Bush, who visited a flag factory as part of his campaign lastyear, joined Republican leaders on Capitol Hill in a drive for aconstitutional amendment to give the federal government and thestates specific power to protect the flag from desecration.   Foley and other key Democrats, however, argue that such anamendment would dangerously create a loophole in the Bill of Rights,and a regular statute could meet the high court's concerns.   ``We offer a carefully drawn, constitutionally sound statute, alaw that will protect the flag with no threat to our precious rightof free speech,'' said Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of theHouse Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on constitutional law.   Edwards said the statute could pass muster with the court becauseit does not make expression illegal, just the actual physical abuseof the flag.   But Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., senior Republican onEdwards' subcommittee, said that approach gutted the purpose of thestatute.   ``Why are we so reluctant to amend the Constitution to demandthat flag desecration be prohibited?'' he said. ``Is it too much toask those who consider themselves Americans to be required to haverespect for our flag?''   The House bill includes a provision for expedited review of thelaw by the Supreme Court if its constitutionality is challenged, andan exception so that veterans groups could continue their practiceof disposal of old, worn-out flags by burning them.   Opponents of the statute said the disposal exception was aloophole that could protect unsavory flag burners _ that they coulddirty their flags before burning them. The bill's drafters, however,said the dirtying itself would be illegal.</TEXT></DOC>
