In it A. Mouchot, pioneer of solarengineering, presented many findings, experiences and ideas. The chaptersof the book deal with: thermal solar energy (heat source, earth surface,solar receiver); light and heat radiation (glass pane, solar spectrum);strength of irradiation (intensity, influences, measurements); theoryof burning mirrors (experiments, suggestions); solar receivers (fountain,solar cooking-pan, solar oven); solar machines (solar pumps, devicesto heat steam engines); solar steam engine (solar pump, machine drivenwith hot air or ammonia); large apparatuses (world exhibition, breakingup of water by thermal column). Finally the solar energy pioneer pointsout possibilities and chances of a technology utilizing solar energy.(HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
