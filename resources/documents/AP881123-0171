IBP Inc. is committed to the three-year program as part of anaccord with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration andthe United Food and Commercial Workers union, settling $5.7 millionin proposed fines by the government.   The terms call for IBP, formerly known as Iowa Beef Processors,to pay a reduced fine of $975,000 while establishing a model jobredesign program at its 2,800-worker flagship plant in Dakota City,Neb., to address repetitive trauma disorders such as tendinitis andcarpal tunnel syndrome.   The ailments involve an inflamation of muscle and nerve tissuesaround joints, eventually rendering them incapable of movement. Themost common cause is repeated hand, wrist and arm motions _sometimes as many as 1,000 of them an hour _ associated with cuttingmeat.   Cumulative trauma work-related disorders are the leading healthproblem among packinghouse workers, who have an injury rate fourtimes the national average and nearly double the rate amongconstruction workers.   ``This settlement is an important victory for job safety and canserve as a model approach for reducing injuries and illnesses in oneof America's most hazardous industries,'' said Labor Secretary AnnMcLaughlin.   ``We expect these steps to serve as an industry-wide blueprintand to provide other industries with valuable information forhandling their own cumulative trauma disorders,'' she said.   OSHA officials and labor leaders called IBP's recognition of therepetitive motion disorders as an occupational illness a majormilestone in a nearly three-year-long effort to address the problem.   Following a series of congressional hearings and OSHAinvestigations largely initiated by the UFCW and the AFL-CIO's Foodand Allied Service Trades (FAST) Department, the government assessedIBP fines of $2.6 million and $3.1 million over the last two yearsfor violations at the Dakota City plant.   ``The most important thing here is not the U.S. governmentcollecting a fine,'' said William Wynn, the president of the union,which includes 100,000 packinghouse workers nationwide in itsmembership.   ``Despite past differences, what's important is that we'resitting down and trying to develop something that will make it (IBP)a safer place to work,'' he said.   Just last month OSHA fined another meatpacker, John Morrell andamp;Co., $4.33 million for ignoring what the agency said were hazards atits plant in Sioux Falls, S.D., similar to those found at IBP'sDakota City plant.   But the agency said the conditions at Morrell were much worse,with more than 800 of its 2,000 workers at Sioux Falls sustainingwhat the agency called serious and disabling repetitive motioninjuries between May of 1987 and the same month this year.   Among other charges, OSHA accused Morrell of making dozens ofworkers return to jobs immediately after undergoing surgery tocorrect the injuries, even though safety experts recommended theytake at least 30 to 60 days off for the wounds to heal.   Morrell has sought to stop OSHA's enforcement activities infederal court, saying the agency was practicing ``guilt byheadlines'' to single it out.   Like Morrell, IBP also had bitterly contested the OSHA fines,accusing the agency of using them ``to intimidate companies ...unless they accept Alice in Wonderland theories'' of workplacesafety.   Maurice McGill, IBP's executive vice president, said Wednesdayhis company still disagrees with OSHA's regulatory philosophy thepast three years of targeting large companies for inspections andassessing them stiff fines to set an example.   But McGill acknowledged that IBP until recently had focused moreof its job safety efforts on curbing more typical injuries such asknife cuts.   ``Very little is understood about cumulative trauma disorders,''he said. ``There are a number of people in this world who stylethemselves as ergonomists and know all the answers. But the answersare not quite as easy as this.''   Under the accord, the Dakota City plant will hire a pair ofergonomists _ people who specialize in designing jobs to fit workersand begin implementing the changes _ such as the use of betterknives _ within three months.   Results from several experiments at the plant are to beimplemented at IBP's 14 other meatpacking facilities over the nextthree years ``where feasible,'' McGill said.   A separate agreement between the company and the union also callsfor the establishment of a 15-member team of Dakota City workers toevaluate all ergonomic conditions at the plant.   Similar arrangements now exist between the United Auto Workersand car and truck manufacturers, but this is the first time thatthey have been extended to include meatpacking, union officials said.   IBP is the nation's largest beef and pork processor, servinglargely institutional markets such as hotels, military bases andhospital and grocery chains who sell its products under differentnames. ConAgra Inc. of Omaha, Neb., outranks IBP in total sales, butonly if its recently acquired poultry operations are counted.</TEXT></DOC>
