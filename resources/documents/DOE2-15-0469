<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-15-0469 </DOCNO><TEXT>The primary objective of this program is to develop a more fundamentalunderstanding of the mechanical forces exerted on a cross flow filterwhen in operation so that means can be devised to avoid mechanical failuresof the filter and reliability can be improved. The ceramic cross flowfilter has been demonstrated to be a superior high temperature and pressurebarrier filter suitable for application in both oxidizing and reducingatmospheres, however, a recurrent operating problem has been experiencedin virtually all developmental programs to date. This difficulty manifestsitself in a tendency of the layered filter to delaminate along the surfaceformed by two adjacent layers. Results are discussed from the pressurestress tests, thermal analysis, and combined pressure and thermal loading.</TEXT></DOC>
