Although the ruling came in the case of Gene Arline, a tubercular third-grade teacher from Florida, it was widely seen as setting a precedent for workers with AIDS.    &quot;It's a tremendous, wonderful ruling, and we're very excited about it,&quot; said Benjamin Schatz, San Francisco-based attorney for National Gay Rights Advocates. &quot;It's going to send a clear and unmistakable message to employers across the country that AIDS-based discrimination is illegal.&quot;    &quot;I think it's going to be tremendously influential in AIDS cases across the country,&quot; said Urvashi Vaid, attorney and spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-based National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. &quot;In some ways, the TB case was tougher to win because TB is airborne, while AIDS transmission requires intimate contact,&quot; Ms. Vaid added. &quot;But we won by such a clear margin -- 7-2.&quot;    The decision requires employers receiving federal funds to evaluate workers with AIDS or other disease-based handicaps on a case-by-case basis, weighing job qualifications, physical impairment and the precise risk of disease transmission on the job. AIDS, which is transmitted by sexual contact, contaminated blood and needles, isn't believed to be casually contagious.    Still, New York labor attorney Stuart Bompey predicted the ruling &quot;will be disturbing to companies in the food service industry. They took comfort in the Justice Department opinion that fear of contagion could be a reason to exclude someone from the work force. The Arline case basically destroys that.&quot;    Food companies, he added, &quot;are presented with a very difficult problem. Fear in many cases can destroy their operations.&quot; Many of his clients have quietly placed employees on extended paid leaves of absence, or reached &quot;reasonable accommodation,&quot; moving or modifying their positions, he said. The future of such unpublicized settlements is unclear under the new rule.    Enserch Corp. of Dallas created a flap when it instituted AIDS blood tests for its cafeteria workers. The Supreme Court decision, however, doesn't address the question of people who test positive for the infection, but aren't yet sick with AIDS. Federal health officials estimate so-called healthy carriers number about 1.5 million.    To Raytheon Co., the Lexington, Mass.-based electronics concern, the decision &quot;comes as no surprise,&quot; a spokesman said. Raytheon was recently ordered to pay $4,300 in back pay, plus interest, to the estate of John Chadbourne, a former quality control analyst in its Goleta, Calif., electromagnetics division. Mr. Chadbourne was diagnosed as having AIDS in January 1984 and placed on leave with medical disability pay. He brought actions against the company, but died 11 months later. &quot;We felt we treated him fairly,&quot; a spokesman said. But the California Fair Employment and Housing Commission ordered the company to pay the difference between Mr. Chadbourne's disability pay and his salary. The company said it may appeal.    The Arline ruling will have a clear impact on local governments and hospitals that have sought to dismiss or reassign workers with AIDS. In one highly publicized case, Todd Shuttleworth, an employee of Broward County, Fla., was dismissed from his job because of fears of contagion. The case, which had urged a similar interpretation of the statute behind the Supreme Court's ruling, was recently settled when Mr. Shuttleworth was offered another position with the county.    More recently, two Chicago doctors were reassigned by a Cook County hospital after their illness was dislosed. One accepted reassignment; the other resisted the move. The American Civil Liberties Union has said it will represent the physician.    Similarly, National Gay Rights Advocates' Mr. Schatz said his group is representing the case of a government nurse who has tested positive for AIDS antibodies, but doesn't have the disease.    &quot;I think the ruling will eventually be extended to cover carriers,&quot; Mr. Schatz predicted. &quot;The issue wasn't before the court. But when you look at the court's reasoning, it's encouraging. The court rejected the Justice Department concept that fear of contagion is grounds for dismissal.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
