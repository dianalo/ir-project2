(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Milken, who was charged bya federal lawsuit with insider trading, almost single-handedlybuilt ``junk-bond'' financing into the tool of choice for corporateraiders during the past dozen years.   Milken was seen for years as a Wall Street whiz kid, who hadhelped transform Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. from a minor playerinto a powerhouse.   Even when it became known several months ago that he was underinvestigation for insider trading, Milken and Drexel took theoffensive.   Drexel waged a public-relations blitz, stressing the role ofjunk bonds _ notes that are highly risky but offer high yields _ inhelping small companies get off the ground and downplaying theirrole megabuck takeover battles.   The normally secretive Milken, 42, began accepting speakingengagements and granting some interviews _ with the condition thatquestions about the Securities and Exchange Commission and theinvestigation of him were off limits.   His comments focused almost solely on his latest pet plan _ toalleviate the Latin American debt crisis by swapping debt forequity or selling securities backed by those countries' oil andsilver resources.   Milken reportedly makes $40 million a year as the head ofDrexel's junk-bond operation. That is several times more than thefirm's chairman. Milken's personal fortune has been estimated atmore than $500 million.   He lives with his children and wife, Lori _ his high schoolsweetheart whom he married at age 22 _ in a house on the formerestate of the late actor Clark Gable in suburban Encino, anupper-middle-class section of the San Fernando Valley two milesfrom his childhood home.   Milken's fascination with finance dates to his boyhood. At age10, a favorite pastime was poring over tax returns prepared by hisfather, an accountant.   After studying business at the University of California,Berkeley, and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School,Milken went to work for Drexel Firestone andamp; Co. in Philadelphia as ajunior bond trader.   Drexel merged with Burnham andamp; Co. in 1973 and Lambert BrusselsWitter in 1976, and Milken's job was moved to New York. Milkenworked hard to make a name for himself but never became acclimatedto the East.   In 1977, he persuaded Drexel to let him move the company'sjunk-bond operations from Wall Street to Beverly Hills, just offswank Rodeo Drive.   Milken became enormously successful in California, building aclose-knit network of junk-bond investors. He is in charge of the150 people who work at Drexel's junk-bond operation.   He still works 12 to 13 hours a day, seven days a week and won'ttolerate lack of drive among those who work for him.   Associates say they need to make appointments to meet with himeven on weekends.   He once said he had no hobbies ``because what I do is fun.''</TEXT></DOC>
