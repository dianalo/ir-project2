<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-19-0951 </DOCNO><TEXT>In an attempt to determine whether radiation therapy leads to an increaseddensity of salivary glands on subsequent contrast-enhanced CT, 109 CTscans from 78 patients with head and neck tumors were reviewed. The densityof parotid and submandibular glands was subjectively evaluated (comparedwith adjacent muscle) and correlated with treatment including surgery,chemotherapy, and radiation. Density of the parotid and/or submandibularglands was found to be significantly associated with previous irradiationon contrast-enhanced scans (p less than .05). One or both glands weredenser than normal in seven (44%) of 16 patients who received only radiationtherapy and in eight (38%) of 21 who received chemotherapy and radiationtherapy, compared with only two (10%) of 20 patients who received chemotherapyalone and two (4%) of 52 patients who received neither. The type or amountof irradiation, type of chemotherapy, or timing of the CT scan afterthe initiation of treatment was not found to be significant. We concludethat the density of the parotid and/or submandibular glands on contrast-enhancedCT is frequently increased after radiation therapy for tumors of thehead and neck.</TEXT></DOC>
