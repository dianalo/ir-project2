(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Authorities are investigatingallegations that a newspaper editor decked Mendocino County's topschool official with a single punch during a meeting of the schoolboard.   Bruce Anderson, editor and publisher of the Anderson ValleyAdvertiser, left Monday night's meeting 20 minutes before sheriff'sdeputies arrived to take a complaint from School Superintendent JimSpence.   Anderson, reached later by the Santa Rosa Press Democrat,conceded he punched Spence and said he ``felt very stupid and veryembarrassed.''   Witnesses told the newspaper the blow came after Spence calledAnderson ``a third-rate McCarthyite.''   Spence, 46, signed an assault and battery complaint and the casewill be submitted to the district attorney, said Sheriff's Lt.Larry Gander.   Anderson, 48, was recently in the news over a hoax interview heprinted in his 2,500-circulation weekly, published in Boonville.   The fake interview published earlier this year quoted Rep.Douglas Bosco as calling his constituents ``a bunch of easilystirred-up know-nothing malcontents who couldn't care less aboutanything other than their beautiful ocean and where their nextjoint is coming from.''</TEXT></DOC>
