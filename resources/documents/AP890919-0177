State Department officials said last week that while they thoughtsuch a ban would eventually be discussed in an international forum,the United States needed more data on the effects of drift netfishing before pushing for one.   ``There are those who say it is premature, but it would beirresponsible to sit on our hands,'' said Rep. Jolene Unsoeld,D-Wash., who sponsored the drift net amendment. ``We already knowour salmon are being stolen.''   The data will be gathered under provisions of recently negotiatedagreements with Japan, Korea and Taiwan, the three nations withdrift net fleets operating in the Nouth Pacific.   The amendment was attached to bill reauthorizing the so-calledMagnuson Fishery Conservation and Managment Act of 1976, whichcreated the 200-mile U.S. fishing zone and eight regional fisheriescouncils to manage the ocean resources.   The reauthorization bill adopted by the committee's fisheries andwildlife conservation subcommittee requires the secretary of stateto seek ``as soon as possible'' an international drift net ban andto report back to Congress in 18 months on the progress ofnegotiations including a list of nations that have refused to talk.   U.S. fishermen claim the drift net fleets, under the guise offishing for squid, are actually harvesting salmon in quantities thathave already caused a drop in Alaska, Washington state and Oregonfish runs.   Environmental groups have also claimed the nets are responsiblefor the deaths of thousands of marine mammals, sea birds and othermarine animals annually.   Subcommittee chairman Gerry Studds, D-Mass., said ``no otherfishing method is as destructive or indiscriminate'' as drift netsand the legislation would ``set a national goal'' of banning driftnet fishing on the high seas.</TEXT></DOC>
