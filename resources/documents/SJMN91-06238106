JEWS, ARABS WONDER  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  THE COUP'S AFTERMATH  </MEMO><TEXT>     Until the Soviet coup unceremoniously collapsed, Jews here feared, and manyArabs hoped, that a new Soviet government would stem the exodus of Soviet Jewsimmigrating to Israel. About 185,000 came last year, and an additional 200,000are expected this year. Many of them settle either in Jewish neighborhoods oftraditionally-Arab East Jerusalem or in the contested West Bank, where housingis cheap and government mortgage benefits are generous.;   Even moresignificant is the potential effect of the Soviet turmoil on the proposedMiddle East peace conference tentatively scheduled for October with the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union as co-sponsors. President Bush said Friday thatthe return of Mikhail Gorbachev to power improved the chances for a peaceconference in October, while Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir suggestedit might have to be delayed.;   In some ways, nothing has changed.;   The mainobstacle remains the question of who will represent the Palestinians. TheIsraelis will not negotiate with anyone from the Palestine LiberationOrganization, which they consider a terrorist group, or residents of EastJerusalem, which Israel annexed after the 1967 war.;   But all the majorplayers continue to be signed on. And so, the leaders of Israel, Jordan,Syria, Lebanon and Egypt, who all have agreed to attend, maintained a discreetsilence about the Soviet coup until it became clear that it had failedWednesday night. No public sympathy for the coup leaders means there is noreason to strike those countries off the list of serious negotiators withIsrael.;   Libya and Iraq were the only Arab states to praise Gorbachev'souster as president. So did Farouk Kaddoumi, a hard-line senior PLO official.;  But Palestinian leaders who live in East Jerusalem and in the West Bank weremore circumspect, even while they acknowledged that many of their people hadsaid &quot;good riddance&quot; to a man they believe has betrayed them while welcoming anew Soviet government to counterbalance the United States.;   &quot;You may go outin the streets and find Palestinians are jubilant,&quot; said Saeb Iraikat, apolitical science professor and self-professed &quot;messenger to the PLO&quot; who hadbeen invited to the Soviet Union next month to explain the Palestinianperspective.;   &quot;But that will just screw us more, like what happened with(Palestinian support for) Saddam (Hussein). That doesn't mean the voices ofsanity and statesmanship are absent among Palestinians,&quot; Iraikat said.;   Bothprivately and publicly, Israeli government officials say their onlyrequirement of the Soviets is a re-establishment of full diplomatic ties withIsrael before a peace conference convenes.;   But Shamir, in a Thursdayinterview with the daily newspaper Yediot, suggested that the Soviet crisismay end up postponing a peace conference.;   &quot;It is difficult for me todetermine if the original timetable for the convening of the conference inOctober will materialize,&quot; he said, noting &quot;problems&quot; facing both Arabs andSoviets. &quot;As I've said in the past, there's no great importance to theparticular date of October. The importance is in the willingness of the sidesto march toward mutual reconciliation.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CAROL MORELLO, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Jerusalem  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910825  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  19A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  552  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, August 25, 199100238106,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
