(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An investor group led by New Yorkfinancier Asher B. Edelman has reduced its stake in PaylessCashways Inc., leading analysts to speculate that the group mayabandon efforts to acquire the building materials retailer.   The group sold about 500,000 Payless shares Friday, reducing itsholding from 8.1 percent to 6.3 percent, according to documentsfiled Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thegroup, which now owns about 2.1 million shares, remains thecompany's largest shareholder.   The group, directed by Edelman and Sutherland Lumber-SouthwestInc. of Kansas City, did not disclose why more shares had beensold. Perry Sutherland, a member of the group, declined to commenton what the investors planned to do with their remaining shares.   Analysts said the stock sale seemed to clear the way for a groupof Payless senior managers to buy the company for $27 a share, or$909 million. Their bid, announced June 30, requires shareholderapproval.   Payless became the subject of takeover rumors more than threemonths ago when its stock soared in heavy trading. In May, theEdelman-Sutherland group disclosed it had a large stake in Paylessand said that it might try to acquire the company. The group laterincreased its position to 9.9 percent.   Since then, the group periodically has sold Payless shares.Moreover, the group has not made an offer for Payless, and recentlythe investors stopped commenting publicly on what they planned todo.   Sutherland Lumber is a competitor of Payless and is also basedin Kansas City.   Payless stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, fellTuesday to $26.75, down 37{ cents a share.   Analysts said that because the Edelman-Sutherland group had beenselling Payless shares since late May, it appeared unlikely thatthat group or anyone else would make a competing offer.   ``I'd say the chances of another offer is about the same as the(management) deal not going through,'' said Richard Pyle, ananalyst who follows Payless at Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood Inc. inMinneapolis.   Payless has 200 stores in 26 states and has about 15,000employees. It has 10 stores in the Kansas City area, where itemploys 1,400 people.</TEXT></DOC>
