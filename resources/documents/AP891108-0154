(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat L. Douglas Wilder claimed ahairbreadth victory that would make him the nation's first electedblack governor, but Republican J. Marshall Coleman refused toconcede said he would demand a recount.   Fewer than 8,000 votes out of 1.7 million cast separated the twocandidates in the unofficial returns from Tuesday's election, whichsaw the largest voter turnout for a statewide election in Virginiahistory.   Reports from the state's 1,967 precincts gave Wilder 889,869votes to 882,137 for Coleman.   Coleman called a news conference today to announce that he wouldask for a recount if the official tally shows the candidatesseparated by less than one half of one percent of the votes _ acertainty based on the unofficial figures.   ``Let me first say that I congratulate Doug Wilder on ahard-fought campaign and if he is certified the winner he will havemy full support,'' Coleman told reporters at his Northern Virginiacampaign headquarters.   However, he said that ``for the good of the new governor,'' it isnecessary that the public have complete confidence in the results.   Wilder, who also held a news conference today, dismissed asuggestion that the racial factor threw his election into doubtwhile his white running mates for lieutenant governor and attorneygeneral won substantial victories.   ``I'm saying it is not and was not a factor in the resultsbecause I was elected,'' Wilder said.   Earlier, he said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that his votetotals were a sign of the gains made by blacks in America.   ``It's an excellent testament to the people of Virginia, to thepeople of this nation, as to how far we've come in a very short spanof time,'' the 58-year-old lieutenant governor said.   ``The people of Virginia have spoken,'' Wilder told supportersTuesday night at a jubilant rally. ``Whatever it takes, that's whatI want to win by.''   But Coleman, a 47-year-old former attorney general, did notaccept defeat.   ``This race is not yet over,'' he told supporters. ``We don't yetknow what the outcome is.''   ``This governor's race is too close to call,'' said DonaldHuffman, chairman of the state Republican Party. ``This is a racethat's going to be recounted. All we ask for is a fair and honestcounting of the ballots.''   The difference between the candidates' totals was well within the1 percent separation required for a recount, and possibly within thehalf a percent margin that allows the apparent loser to seek arecount without risk of having to pay for it if results areunchanged.   The State Board of Elections will meet Nov. 27 to certify theresults. Coleman then would have 10 days _ until Dec. 7 _ to requesta recount. There is no timetable in state law for completing arecount.   Observers could not recall a closer gubernatorial race, and the65 percent of the 2.5 million registered voters who turned out alsoappeared to set a record.   Wilder campaigned as the heir to two successive Democraticadministrations headed by Charles S. Robb, now a U.S. senator, andGov. Gerald L. Baliles, who could not succeed himself under Virginialaw.   He noted that 80 percent of the Virginia electorate is white andcited this as evidence that race had not been a factor in theelection.   ``Instead of letting race be a factor they decided the reverse,''he said. ``They believed in me notwithstanding accident of birth,class or any other demarcation.''   Coleman, who lost the 1981 race for governor to Robb, saidVirginians wanted a change and pointed to five tax increases in fouryears under Baliles.   But the leading issues in the campaign were abortion andquestions about the moral character of the candidates.   Wilder took a strong pro-choice stand and charged that Coleman,who opposed abortion except to save the life of the woman, wanted toset back the clock on women's rights.   Wilder blasted Coleman for accepting huge contributions fromnorthern Virginia real estate developers _ although Wilder himselfhad wealthy backers, among them John W. Kluge, whom Forbes Magazineidentified as the richest man in America.   Campaign reports filed by the candidates showed that Wilder hadraised $6.46 million and Coleman $8.05 million in the third mostexpensive gubernatorial election in the nation's history, includingthe sums spent during primaries.   Jack W. Gravely, president of the state chapter of the NationalAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, said that ifWilder's victory stands it would inspire hope among the nation'sblacks.   ``But I do not think that one night in this state can erase yearsof degradation and segregation,'' Gravely said.   Wilder, a millionaire lawyer, grew up in Richmond in what hedescribed as ``gentle poverty.'' He earned money for college bywaiting on tables at whites-only political dinners in downtownRichmond, and became the first black to sit in the Virginia Senatesince Reconstruction.   Coleman, a Shenandoah Valley native who has practiced law in theWashington, D.C. suburbs for eight years, has been out of officesince the loss to Robb. A moderate in the state GOP, he wasdiscouraged from running in the 1985 lieutenant governor's race byparty conservatives.   The Republican Party registered a net gain of four seats in thestate House of Delegates, a result that left Democrats with a 59-39majority.</TEXT></DOC>
