In the battle for the eastern city of Jalalabad, the guerrillaslaunched another assault, attacking it from four directions, saidForeign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani.   Foreign journalists saw about 200 trucks from the convoy reach agovernment checkpoint on the Salang Highway just north of thecapital Tuesday. Amani said more would arrive throughout the nightand Wednesday.   He said the convoy, which was blocked for more than a week,began moving again after the government soldiers dislodged theU.S.-backed guerrillas from two posts on the highway.   Helicopter gunships provided air cover for the convoy, whichincluded a few crowded buses and taxis. Gunfire was heard as thevehicles moved south, but truck drivers said it was not serious.   Government troops in armored personnel carriers waved their capsand cheered as they saw the convoy's vehicles approach the capital.   After the departure of Soviet troops in February, Sovietsupplies continued to move down the 260-mile Salang Highway untilthe guerrillas blocked it on April 6.   The government on Tuesday sent a separate convoy of about 105trucks from Kabul to Jalalabad, about 75 miles to the east, Amanisaid. He said he believed the vehicles had reached the city.   However, some guards at a checkpoint about 10 miles east ofKabul said the road was closed. Others said it was open most of theway.   That road has been blocked for more than two weeks byPakistani-based guerrillas who have been attacking Jalalabad sinceMarch 6.   Amani said 18 civilians were killed and 21 wounded in theJalalabad fighting. Two government soldiers were killed and fiveinjured, while 47 guerrillas died and 19 were injured, he said.   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have made Jalalabad the target oftheir first major offensive since the departure of the Soviettroops, who had been helping the Marxist government.   Amani also reported 32 guerrillas killed in battles to the south.   There was no way to confirm those reports independently.   In other fighting, guerrillas attacked a district near thesouthern city of Khost, Amani said. He said no civilians orgovernment troops were killed but 18 guerrillas died.   Government forces also battled guerrillas in the southernprovince of Kandahar, killing 14 and wounding 40, Amani said.</TEXT></DOC>
