The full House is expected to pass the measure, with a voteexpected sometime later this summer, but its unclear whether it canattract enough support to override an almost certain presidentialveto.   The 22-17 committee vote on Wednesday came after Democratsdefeated a Republican attempt to ease the proposed restrictions.   The bill would spell out more specifically how a president mustnotify the House and Senate intelligence oversight committees whenhe authorizes a covert action.   Under the proposal, a version of which already has been passedby the Senate, the president would be required to report any covertaction to the intelligence committees within 48 hours of itsauthorization.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>South Africa Sanctions Bill To Go Ahead Despite Dim Prospects</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Senate supporters of a bill imposing harsh newsanctions against white-dominated South Africa concede they do nothave the votes to override a threatened veto by President Reagan.   But they said they would battle for Senate passage of the billto highlight congressional opposition to South Africa's racialpolicies.   The bill would end most trade with South Africa and call forwithdrawal of U.S. corporate investment.   Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee onWednesday, Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead stronglyopposed the harsh sanctions measure as counterproductive.   And Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the leading opponent of usingsanctions to increase pressures on South Africa to adopt majorityrule reforms, said he will introduce legislation repealing the lesssevere sanctions bill passed over President Reagan's veto two yearsago.   Whitehead said that while the Reagan administration believesapartheid is repugnant, ``Resorting to drastic remedies, such asthe misuse of American power to destabilize the South Africaneconomy, only increases the chances of a catastrophic outcome forall South Africans.'</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>House Keeps Space Station Funds in $10.7 Billion NASA Bill</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The House approved $10.7 billion to run theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration after defeating amove to divert $400 million from space station funds into socialprograms.   The measure still must pass the Senate, whose appropriationscommittee on Wednesday also voted $10.7 billion for NASA. TheSenate bill, however, assumes that $600 million will be transferredto the space station from unspent defense funds.   That proposed fund transfer was called unacceptable in a letterthat President Reagan sent to Sen. John C. Stennis, D-Miss., andMark Hatfield, R-Ore., the chairman and ranking minority member ofthe appropriations committee.   At the same time, however, the president said that letting thespace station wither for lack of funds would be ``totallyunacceptable.''   NASA had asked for $967 million in the fiscal year that beginsOct. 1 to start the design phase of the $16 billion space station.Under the bill passed by the House, the agency would get $902million.   The NASA funds are part of a $59.7 billion appropriation billfor the Department of Housing and Urban Development and 15independent agencies that passed the House 377-40.</TEXT></DOC>
