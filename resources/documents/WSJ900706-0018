And Houston wants to take advantage ofthe situation.   The thousands of red begonias and the 126 spanking newpolice cars that will be much in evidence are but small partsof a big scheme to put the best face on the city for theannual economic summit of industrialized nations that beginsMonday.</LP><TEXT>   Some 4,000 journalists will be here doing stories, andHouston wants at least some of that to result in business forHouston -- global financing for new development, forinstance, in a city that has been depressed since the bottomdropped out of oil and that is just now coming back.   Houston could use a little respect; it feels the need tobe noticed.   &quot;This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for this city,&quot;exclaims advertising executive Larry Taylor, who, along withmany Houstonians, is hyperbolic about what next week's summitmeans for his town.   Never mind that reporters keep telling the city's phalanxof PR people that they are coming to write about the summititself. &quot;Reporters are less interested in Houston than in theseven leaders&quot; who are holding talks here, says PeterRiddell, Washington bureau chief for the Financial Times ofLondon.   Never mind that the ranks of summit journalists have beenthinned by a London meeting of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization and by the Soviet Party Congress in Moscow,competing news events of recent days. Many press people willbe too pooped from those trips to pursue what they see ascivic-boosterism fluff in the Houston metro area. &quot;We don'thave much time to go around,&quot; says Pascal Taillandier ofAgence France Presse.   The city was taken aback to learn a few weeks ago thatalthough Thatcher, Kohl and Mitterrand will be here,Jennings, Brokaw and Rather sent regrets.   &quot;It was a real blow,&quot; says Alex Kopatic, another of thosehyping Houston to reporters. &quot;Disappointment was severe.&quot;That the networks weren't dropping anchor in Houston wasfront-page news in the Houston Post and a major preoccupationof the nation's fourth-largest city for several days.   The networks will, of course, have people here next week,but not their biggest people. And that grates. Dan Rather ofCBS, is after all, a native son. George Bush calls Houstonhome, too. Which is why the summit is to be here in the firstplace. (Local television reporters noted this week that anewspaper in Japan did write about Houston and used aphotograph of Mayor Kathy Whitmire.)   Heads of state are important people, but so far as Houstonis concerned, the summit's most important people are thejournalists. &quot;The international press was the major benefitwe saw&quot; in playing host to the summit, says Mayor Whitmire.   Houston's breathlessness about media coverage is, to agreat extent, a byproduct of its recent wrenching financialhard times. The thin-skinned energy capital got bruisedconsiderably as reporters wrote graphic stories in themid-1980s detailing what the crash in oil prices did to thisonce high-flying region, says Lyn Johnson, the summit'sdeputy communications director. Now that it has them here forthe summit, Houston wants to convince reporters that it is nolonger on the mat.   About 50 summit workers have been cranking out pressreleases at the rate of two a week since April. They havedelivered more than 5,000, 200-page Houston reference guidesand set up plans to serve food to the press round the clockduring the three-day summit. (Japanese reporters, writing forTokyo deadlines, will be able to take their dinners at 3 a.m.if they wish to.) Reporters too busy to go out on the town insearch of stories about Houston can visit booths and speakersat press headquarters more than glad to provide informationabout the city's huge medical center, its space and oilindustries and whatnot.   Summit handlers have even figured out how to finesseHouston's miserable summer weather. &quot;Houston's Hot,&quot; is thecity's upbeat summit slogan. Mr. Taylor, the adman, says hecame up with the very apt line during the first 10 minutes ofa brainstorming session. Still, he says, it took a committeethree weeks of wrangling to approve it. People were worriedthat it would just encourage unwanted stories about the localclimate. Otherwise, who would notice the 95-degree days andthe 90% humidity?   Reporters who do venture out into the blistering heat ofthis sprawling town will see how Houston has gussied itselfup. City horticulturist Dee Howell, for instance, exhortedHoustonians to plant red and white flowers around theirhouses. &quot;They have a lot of image impact,&quot; she says,&quot;especially a lot of television impact.&quot;   Texas Commerce Bank employees volunteered to spend aweekend planting 8,500 red begonias around Rice Universitywhere the summitteers will hold their meetings.Unfortunately, says Brandy Wolf, who organized the planting,&quot;there's no sprinkler system.&quot; Fortunately, a landscapingconcern donated its services in trucking in water to keep theblossoms on the begonias until Chancellor Kohl and networktelevision have left town.   That's typical. A lot of Houston's image burnishing forthe summit is cosmetic and temporary. The city's skyscrapers,for instance, are going to leave lights on at night to lookgood for the cameras. Also, Houston isn't fining sidewalkvendors for the time being. &quot;We're trying to foster a streetlife,&quot; says Ross Allyn, a city-council aide. &quot;This isdirected at the 4,000 reporters coming to town,&quot; he adds.   The police were equally matter-of-fact about holding back126 new squad cars for more than two months so as to keepthem in factory-fresh condition for summit motorcades.   Having the cars but not being able to use them has causedsome annoyance on the force in recent weeks. Mark Clark, aHouston policeman and head of an officers' association, says,&quot;We're just barely getting by&quot; with the vehicles in thedepartment's aging 1,000-car fleet. &quot;The cars break down.&quot;Veteran Houston radio journalist Garvin Berry chimed in: Thesummit has &quot;warped {the} judgment&quot; of civic leaders.   James Harrington, legal director for the Texas CivilLiberties Union in Austin, attacked another decision. The 14judges who hear criminal misdemeanor cases here met lastmonth and decided to double the bail bonds, to $1,000, forout-of-state protesters who get arrested during the summit.The step is necessary, they said, to ensure that itinerantwrongdoers return to Houston for trial later on.   &quot;That's just a pretext for punishing speech,&quot; says Mr.Harrington. &quot;They just want to have a nice, clean, antisepticsummit.&quot;   A number of demonstrators, ranging from the Ku Klux Klanto anti-abortion activists, nevertheless are expected inHouston next week. The higher bonds will hardly affectprotester turnout, says Jimi Clark, march organizer for thePoor People's Campaign for Economic Justice.   Summit planners considered asking judges to keepsensational cases off their dockets during summit week, but,under fire, abandoned the idea. Mr. Harrington says, &quot;Thesepeople need a lesson in democracy.&quot;   So the city is uptight, as perhaps any city might be. Andit wants to take advantage of the photo opportunity, as anycity would. Indeed, organizers of the 1988 summit in Torontotold Houston planners that they wish they had done more tocapitalize on the affair when they had the chance. &quot;It's anopportunity wherever the summit is held,&quot; says Albert Louer,who helped set up the 1983 summit in Williamsburg, Va. &quot;Itwould be somewhat ridiculous not to&quot; take advantage of it.   Still, Bill Simon, a University of Houston sociologyprofessor, maintains that &quot;Houston has always beenself-conscious&quot; because it grew so big so fast. As cities go,it is an adolescent. Its population has grown rapidly inrecent years, and most of the skyscrapers that give the cityits impressive modernistic skyline (especially when they arelit up at night) are new in the past decade.   A classic, adolescent identity crisis manifested itselfwhen the Special Events Committee for the summit was tryingto decide between rodeo and ballet as entertainment for thevisiting dignitaries and media people. City planners askedthe city's opera, symphony and ballet to work on a program.&quot;We want to do away with the redneck image,&quot; says TonyLentini, a public-relations volunteer. But the decision wascountermanded by President Bush, wearing his Texas hat nothis Connecticut hat. Wanting a down-home event, he insistedon an evening of barbecue, rodeo and country music. en</TEXT></DOC>
