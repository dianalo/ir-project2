Baker, vice president and chief financial officer, said.    In the year-ago quarter, the company had pro forma earnings of $251,000, or five cents a unit. Mr. Baker estimated that revenue for the quarter fell about 65% to $11 million, compared with $18.2 million last year. Emerald, which designs and sells single-family homes, went public in February and changed to a calendar year from a fiscal year ended March 31.    The official also said in an interview that he expects second-quarter earnings to decline to a break-even level. In the year-earlier quarter, the company had pro forma earnings of $962,000, or 18 cents a unit, on revenue of $18.4 million.    Mr. Baker cited rising home-loan interest rates as the main reason for the expected profit decline in the second-quarter. Emerald has a short-term exposure on mortgages that it finances and then packages for assignment to a mortgage-collateralized bond program. The company also has begun incurring expenses related to its expansion into Southern California.    In addition, second-quarter revenue will be &quot;down slightly&quot; from last year Mr. Baker projected. In last year's first-half, the company had a surge in revenue from a low-margin housing project here. Mr. Baker noted that &quot;very significant sales at one project&quot; distorts the revenue comparisons in the 1987 first-half.    For the full year, Mr. Baker said the company expects earnings to be &quot;equal to, or slightly better&quot; than last year. In 1986, the company had pro forma net income of $5.2 million, or 99 cents a unit, on revenue of $93.8 million.    Mr. Baker said Emerald expects a strong second half because &quot;the first quarter was the best in the company's history for new orders.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
