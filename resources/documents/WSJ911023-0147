Formation of the South African-American Business Councilwas announced as a group of 31 Americans, organized by theWashington lobby group TransAfrica, prepared to leave thecountry after a threeday visit. Bertram Lee, chairman of BMLAssociates in Boston, said at a news conference the councilwould help transfer skills and technology to South Africa.</LP><TEXT>   Max Sisulu, an economist with the ANC, the primarypro-democracy organization here, said the council would be a&quot;resource for black businesses in South Africa&quot; and give thema chance to &quot;connect with their counterparts in the States.&quot;   Though formed by African-Americans, the council will workwith business people of all races in the U.S. who want toencourage black business in South Africa, Mr. Lee said. Butthe work of the council would &quot;most assuredly&quot; not violateany sanctions policy, he added.   Nelson Mandela, ANC president, said the BritishCommonwealth's decision to lift people-to-people sanctions,such as bans on air links, tourism, and cultural andscientific contacts, was &quot;a direct result of our initiative .. . . We felt the time has come to lift these sanctions.&quot;   President Bush has lifted many, but not all, U.S.sanctions against South Africa. &quot;Our nation, since thelifting of sanctions, has been a casual bystander&quot; towardSouth African problems, complained Randall Robinson,TransAfrica's executive director. He called on theadministration to pressure South African President F.W. deKlerk to end the violence that has been afflicting blacktownships. &quot;Our job at home is to put America on the rightside of this issue,&quot; he said.   The U.S. business people, labor leaders and activiststoured some of the violence-torn, poverty-stricken areas inthe townships of Alexandra and Soweto, Mr. Robinson said atthe news conference. For those who hadn't been in SouthAfrica before, he said, &quot;we find ourselves in a state ofshock.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
