The jet-setting arms merchant, allegedly the man who brokeredthe Iran-Contra arms deal, was seized by police at an elegant Bernhotel and jailed, said Pierre Schmid, assistant director of theSwiss Federal Police Office.   Schmid said the arrest came shortly after the U.S. Embassytipped off Swiss authorities that Khashoggi was in the capital anddemanded his arrest.   The United States plans to submit a detailed extradition requestwithin 60 days as required by treaty, said U.S. Embassy spokesmanMichael Korff.   Khashoggi, the Marcoses, five other people and a California bankwere indicted in October by a U.S. District Court in New York.   The indictment accuses the ousted Philippines dictator and hiswife of stealing more than $100 million from the Philippinetreasury to buy real estate and expensive art objects in New York.   Overall, the Philippines says the couple took $3.5 billion incash and property.   The U.S. government alleges that Khashoggi, 54, posed as ownerof some of the assets to help hide that they actually belonged toMarcos, prosecutors have said.   Khashoggi is charged with racketeering, conspiracy, obstructionof justice and mail fraud. Racketeering alone carries a penalty ofup to 20 years in prison.   Swiss authorities said a U.S. diplomatic note demandingKhashoggi's arrest cited four buildings in Manhattan and acollection of paintings that disappeared from a Manila museum.Khashoggi allegedly bought them for Marcos as part of ``obfuscationmaneuvers'' during the ex-president's reign, Schmid said.   Marcos fled into exile in Hawaii after the February 1986civilian-military uprising that put Corazon Aquino in power.   Under the U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty, Swiss authorities mustdecide whether Khashoggi's alleged offenses are considered criminalacts under both U.S. and Swiss law.   Police arrested Khashoggi in a ``gentlemanly'' way without usinghandcuffs at the downtown, five-star Hotel Schweizerhof where hewas staying, manager Jean-Jacques Gauer told The Associated Press.   He was taken to the nearby district jail, the Swiss justiceministry said. Schmid indicated bail was likely to be setexceptionally high.   Khashoggi, 54, arrived in Switzerland on Monday for unidentifiedmedical treatment, said a well-placed Swiss official speaking oncondition of anonymity. Khashoggi, who has lived in Paris, hasvisited a Bern hospital in the past for rejuvenating fresh celltherapy.   His office in Saudi Arabia declined immediate comment on thearrest.   The Philippines claims that after the Marcoses went into exile,their agents and Khashoggi carted away 25 paintings from New Yorkproperties owned by the Marcoses. The action allegedly came after aCalifornia federal judge ordered that none of the Marcoses'property could be moved.   Khashoggi allegedly sold 12 paintings for $3.2 million.   Khashoggi was quoted by a Saudi newspaper in October as denyingthe allegations contained in the indictment and classifying thecase as a civil rather than criminal action.   Khashoggi has 10 days to file an appeal and request his release.The Federal Tribunal, Switzerland's supreme court, would have thefinal say if he fights an extradition order.   Born in Mecca as one of 14 children of the late King Ibn Saud'spersonal physician, Khashoggi became known for his flamboyantlifestyle and business talent.   He figured in several kickback scandals, with U.S. aircraftmanufacturers allegedly paying him large amounts for arrangingbillion-dollar defense contracts.   He reputedly was the main financier and broker in theIran-Contra affair, where proceeds from sales of U.S. arms to Iranallegedly were funneled to rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftistgovernment.   Khashoggi said in 1986 he lost $10 million on the deal.   Published reports once estimated Khashoggi's personal wealth atup to $4 billion and he was reported to be the richest man in theworld. But falling oil prices, stricter control of arms dealing andloss-making deals recently have reportedly left him in financialstraits.   Mrs. Marcos has pleaded innocent to the charges contained in theU.S. indictment. Marcos has said he is too ill to appear in NewYork for legal proceedings.</TEXT></DOC>
