Col. Oliver North personally cashed more than $2,000 in traveler's checks that he received from Contra leader Adolfo Calero, according to sources familiar with the congressional investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.    Investigators for the House-Senate committees, which resume public hearings today, are trying to determine if Col. North used any of the money to pay personal expenses, the sources said.    Associates of Col. North, a central figure in the Reagan administration's covert Iran and Contra operations, said they were certain that while he may have cashed some checks, he didn't use the money himself.    Col. North, who was fired as a White House aide after his role in the Iran-Contra affair was disclosed last year, repeatedly has refused comment. Col. North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, was said by his office to be unavailable.    According to the account provided by the sources, two of the traveler's checks were cashed as payment for airline tickets, and those funds may have been used by Col. North in his covert activities. But the sources said Col. North also cashed more than a dozen checks at grocery stores and other retail establishments in the Washington area.    In addition, one lawmaker sympathetic to Col. North said the panels also have learned that he used the traveler's checks to give a &quot;bonus&quot; of about $1,000 to an associate, Robert Owen, when Mr. Owen was married more than a year ago. Mr. Owen, who served as a courier between Col. North and leaders of Mr. Calero's Nicaraguan Democratic Force, resumes his testimony before the committees today. He declined to comment last night.    Mr. Owen testified last week that during early 1985 he and a White House aide cashed thousands of dollars in traveler's checks that Col. North had given him, and delivered the funds to Contra leaders. According to one source, Col. North received at least $75,000 in checks from Mr. Calero, who had access to $32 million in donations from Saudi Arabia in 1984 and 1985. Col. North distributed the funds to other Contra leaders.    Over the weekend, the Associated Press reported that Col. North's secretary, Fawn Hall, cashed a small traveler's check from the Contras at a fast-food restaurant. The AP said Col. North also used the checks to reimburse a lobbyist for $3,000 for bringing a French counter-insurgency specialist to Washington in 1985 when Congress was reviewing an aid package for the Contras. </TEXT></DOC>
