This city of ancient mosques and modern factories has become asymbol of Turkey's problems in dealing with a flood of ethnic Turksmigrating from Bulgaria to escape a campaign to erase their culture.   Since mid-May, 310,000 ethnic Turks have arrived from Bulgaria inone of the largest mass movements of people since World War II.   The difficulties prompted Turkey to impose a visa requirementlast week to curtail the immigration.   The ethnic Turks say they are escaping a forced assimilationcampaign aimed at changing their Moslem names to Slavic ones, wipingout use of the Turkish language and halting the practice of Islamicrites.   Like immigrants the world over, the Bulgarian Turks flooded intoareas where earlier arrivals had established communities. Bursa, 150miles southwest of Istanbul, received the largest group, anestimated 75,000.   ``Enough,'' said Mayor Teoman Ozalp in an interview. ``In threemonths the city population rose by 10 percent. We cannot cope withit, no city in the world can cope with it.''   Immigrants, residents and city officials say the major problem ishousing.   Many immigrants have gone to stay with relatives, who are puttingup as many as 15 or 20 newcomers in their three-room houses.   About 20,000 immigrants have been given shelter in schools. Butthey will have to be evacuated shortly in preparation for the startof classes Sept. 18.   In the shade at a schoolyard, Ismail Sukruoglu Oren spoke of hisproblems since arriving from Bulgaria four days earlier. The welderhad just gotten a job but was unable to find a home for his family.   ``It was hell there, but it is trouble here, too,'' he said.   Immigrants say that when they do find work, they get less thanthe minimum wage.   For residents, the problems have mounted too. Bursa nativescomplain that some employers are firing workers to hire cheaperimmigrant labor. They say rents have doubled and tripled since thearrival of the ethnic Turks.   According to Mumin Gencoglu, head of the Balkan ImmigrantsAssociation, lack of organization by the government has exacerbatedthe problem.   ``What are farmers doing in this industrial city?'' he asked.``The government should have divided people according to theirprofessions and sent them to areas where there are jobs or landavailable for farming.''   Prefabricated houses should have been constructed immediately, hesaid.   The government has promised to give $150 a month to each familyfor rent beginning next month.   ``But there are no houses for rent. We already had a housingshortage when they started coming,'' says Mayor Ozalp.   The government tried to send the ethnic Turks to different partsof the country, but the orders were not mandatory.   ``We have lost track of 100,000 arrivals,'' said the minister incharge of the immigrants, Ercument Konukman. ``They did not go wherethey were sent. We believe most went to Bursa or Istanbul.''   Even critics of the government admit that no one expected so manyBulgarian Turks streaming in from the Balkans, which was part of theOttoman Empire. Bursa was the capital of that empire in the 14thcentury.   The mass migration began when Bulgaria expelled leaders of aprotest against the 5-year-old assimilation campaign. Bulgaria thenbegan issuing passports that allowed ethnic Turks to leave with afew suitcases and bundles of household goods _ unleashing a flood ofemigration to Turkey.   Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal initially said he was prepared toadmit all of Bulgaria's estimated 1.5 million ethnic Turks. Offersof jobs and housing poured in from around the country, and the first100,000 arrivals were handled relatively smoothly.   But Turkey miscalculated, believing Bulgaria would not want torisk labor shortages by allowing a mass emigration of ethnic Turks,who make up more than 15 percent of Bulgaria's population.   As of Tuesday, ethnic Turks were allowed in only with visas fromTurkish consulates.   Ozal has defended the new requirement as necessary to forceBulgaria into negotiations on an immigration agreement. Turkey isseeking to control the pace of the exodus and ensure immigrants arecompensated for property left behind and accumulated pensionbenefits.   Turkish officials have pledged to give priority in issuing visasto divided families, but immigrants are not satisfied.   ``Now they have no hope, now they will be wiped out as an ethnicgroup,'' lamented one, Sabahattin Hatipoglu.</TEXT></DOC>
