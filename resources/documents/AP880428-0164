(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pat Robertson's presidential campaign wasgiven additional time Thursday to submit financial records in afederal investigation of the tax-exempt status of Robertson'sreligious broadcasting network.   U.S. Magistrate Rebecca B. Smith extended a show-cause order fortwo weeks, until May 12, for documents originally requested by theInternal Revenue Service last December.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Raymond Jackson said Americans ForRobertson and James F. Patterson, the group's former treasurer,have turned over most of the information requested. Jackson hasasked for additional materials, including bank records forRobertson groups in Texas, Michigan and Virginia.   Robert L. O'Donnell, attorney for Americans for Robertson, saidthe records would be available within five days.   ``We have not opposed any of the requests and have made recordsavailable as quickly as possible,'' he said in asking for acontinuance of the order filed late last month.   In addition to financial data, the IRS asked for copies offund-raising letters and ``records of any transactions with theFreedom Council or Christian Broadcasting Network.''   Robertson, a former television evangelist from Virginia Beach,founded the non-profit, tax-exempt CBN and was its president untillast October, when he announced his candidacy for the Republicanpresidential nomination. The cable network's operations were turnedover to one of Robertson's sons.   The Freedom Council, established in 1981 with seed money fromCBN, received nearly $3 million from the network in 1985, accordingto former council officials. That was the year Robertson begansetting up his political organization.   In papers filed with the IRS seeking tax-exempt status, theFreedom Council said it was created to educate Christians on how toget involved in politics.   Critics contend the council acted as a front for the Robertsoncampaign by organizing political neophytes from fundamentalist orcharismatic churches as Robertson volunteers.   The Freedom Council disbanded in 1986 shortly after Americansfor Robertson was formed. Bob Slosser, president of CBN University,headed the council at the time, and Marc Nuttle, Americans forRobertson's initial acting director and Robertson's campaignmanager through most of the primaries, served as a paid councilconsultant.   Under federal law, tax-exempt entities cannot raise money for orsupport political candidates. The loss of tax-exempt status wouldmean contributors could not deduct their donations from incometaxes.</TEXT></DOC>
