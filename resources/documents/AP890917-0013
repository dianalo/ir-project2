Forecasters described Hugo as ``extremely dangerous'' as itchurned toward Puerto Rico and said it could be the most powerfulhurricane to hit the region since Hurricane David in 1979. Thatstorm killed an estimated 1,200 people in the Caribbean and Florida.   At 9 a.m. EDT, Hugo's center was located near latitude 16.6 northand longitude 62.7 west, about 250 miles east-southeast of San Juan,said the National Weather Service in Miami.   Hugo was moving west-northwest at 12 mph and was expected to hitthe Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Sunday night or early Monday,the weather service said. Hurricane warnings were in effect forislands throughout the region.   ``All preparedness actions should be rushed to completion in thewarned areas,'' the weather service said in its 9 a.m. weatherbulletin.   The storm slammed into the French island of Guadeloupe, about 350miles east-southeast of Puerto Rico, just after midnight Sunday.   Phone circuits to affected islands were either busy or jammedearly Sunday and it could not be immediately determined if the stormcaused any casualties on the island of 340,000 people.   Jean-Claude Roure, a government official on Martinique, toldFrench radio there were no reports of deaths of serious injuries onGuadeloupe but that it appeared about 3,000 people were lefthomeless. Martinique is about 100 miles south of Guadeloupe.   Roure reported heavy damage to buildings and said the airportcontrol tower in the city of Pointe-a-Pitre was ``partiallydestroyed.''   ``Since people can't move around and almost all communicationsare cut, it is possible there's more information that has not beenpassed along,'' he said.   He said it appeared that La Desirade, an island of about 1,600people 22 miles east of Guadeloupe, may have been the hardest hit sofar but that all communications with it were cut.   The director of civil security at the French Interior Ministry inParis, Hubert Fournier, said emergency supplies and personnel werebeing prepared to be sent to Guadeloupe as soon as it was known whatwas needed.   Rainfall of up to 10 inches was expected in the path of thehurricane, producing flash floods and possible mud slides in hillyregions, the National Weather Service said. It warned residents inmountainous areas to move to safer locations.   Storm surges up to eight feet above normal were expected incoastal areas, forecasters said.   In Dominica to the south of Guadeloupe, there were power outageson the island's north side where strong winds uprooted trees,France's RFO radio said.   In Antigua, just north of Guadeloupe, heavy rain and very strongwinds also uprooting trees were reported. Authorities there turnedoff power to the entire island of 100,000 people as a precautionarymeasure shortly before midnight.   The radio reported flooding in low-lying areas but provided nodetails. It said dozens of people were moved to shelters. At theplush St. James Club hotel, on the island's southeastern side,guests were evacuated.   In the British dependency of Montserrat, northwest of Guadeloupeand directly in Hugo's path, Joe Dominique, editor at RadioAntilles, said the storm blew down trees and ripped away galvanizedrooftops of several homes in the capital, Plymouth, early Sunday.   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the current Atlantic hurricaneseason, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.</TEXT></DOC>
