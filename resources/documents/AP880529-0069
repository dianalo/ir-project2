The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions survey saidBritain led the field with 374 companies still operating in SouthAfrica. It said the United States led the countries that pulled outwith 134 companies.   The Brussels-based confederation is the largest trade unionorganization in the non-communist world, with a membership of 87million workers in 97 countries.   Activists have urged Western companies to withdraw from SouthAfrica to pressure the government to end apartheid.   Under apartheid, South Africa's system of traditional andlegalized racial segregation, the 26 million blacks have no vote innational affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.   Confederation Secretary General John Vanderveken said in a pressrelease that the report was ``clear evidence of the triumph ofcorporate greed over morality.''   He derided the claim often made by investors in South Africathat their presence could be an instrument for reform. ``Cheaplabor is what brings them to South Africa, not a desire to restoresocial justice,'' Vanderveken said.   The report was particularly critical of companies such as theBritish Tyre and Rubber Co., which it said are failing to respectinternationally agreed minimum standards on wages and workingconditions.   It also blamed some British companies for claiming to havepulled out of South Africa but having retained substantialinterests there.   ``The independent black trade union movement of South Africa isadamant that economic sanctions remain the best way of bringingpeaceful change to their country,'' Vanderveken said. ``The ICFTUremains committed to that policy.''   Following Britain, countries with the biggest number ofcompanies still in South Africa were West Germany with 333; theUnited States, 164; Japan, 103; France, 90; Switzerland, 54; theNetherlands, 29; Austria, 28; Belgium, 20; Australia, 19; Canada,18; Sweden and Denmark, 10 each; Italy, seven; Finland and Ireland,two each; and Spain, Norway, Portugal and Greece with one each.   Among the countries pulling out, Britain was No. 2 with 26companies, Canada, 20; the Netherlands, four; France, two; andItaly and Australia with one each.   The labor organization said several of the 333 German companiesin South Africa were involved in the armaments industry. Amongthose listed were BMW and Volkswagen, whose South Aricansubsidiaries were making armored cars, and a subsidiary of AEGTelefunken, the electronics company, which makes switch gears forarmored cars.   Among U.S. companies in South Africa were MGM, Twentieth CenturyFox and Pan American. French firms included the tourist companyClub Mediterranee and the pharmaceutical and chemical companyRhone-Poulenc. The Dutch airline KLM and the electronics giantPhilips have subsidiaries in South Africa.   The state-controlled Italian petroleum company ENI and Belgium'sleading holding company Societe Generale de Belgique were alsooperating there, it said.</TEXT></DOC>
