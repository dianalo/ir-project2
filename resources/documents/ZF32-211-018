Extended for DOS 2.andP;  1 0 (LAN Magazine's 1991Product of the Year for mainframe gateways), Extra! for Windows 3.10, and3270 Gateway Option for Extra! 1.3 1.andP;  When operating in LAN environments,each of these applications is typically used in conjunction with thecompany's 3270 Gateway Option software, and users may select from manydifferent hardware options.andM;Attachmate maintains Extra! 1.42 as a courtesy to its longtime customers whoare accustomed to both its features and user interface.andP;  When it is used inconjunction with the 3270 Gateway Option, Extra! 1.42 allows a DOSworkstation to connect to an SNA host.andM;Extra! for Windows 3.10 is Attachmate's newest offering.andP;  As its nameimplies, it provides a Windows 3.10-compliant 3270 emulator.andM;Extra! Extended for DOS 2.10, Attachmate's current DOS product, provides aDOS workstation with a complete set of emulation capabilities.andP;  Extra!andO;Extended for DOS supports connection via coaxial cable, Synchronous Data-Link  Control (SDLC), LAN, or Token Ring.andP;  Each option offers the samerobust set of emulation features.andM;This review takes a look at installation, customization, and operation ofseveral of Attachmate's SNA gateway products, in particular, Extra! Extendedfor DOS.andM;First, a bit of background is needed.andP;  For most, the term SNA gatewaytypically refers to the combination of products that permit workstations on anetwork to communicate with an SNA host.andP;  This combination requires bothhardware and software (with Token Ring connections, the interface hardwareused can also be the LAN adapter itself rather than a special gateway board).andM;Separate portions of the software reside in separate  machines.andP;  Some resideon the enduser portion at a workstation on the LAN, and another portion on aso-called gateway machine that provides connection service to all theworkstations within the local workgroup.andP;  INSTALLATIONandM;Installation of most of the Attachmate software follows one of twooptions-full  diskette copying or selective copying via a configurationprogramandM;The first option is the most likely choice for experienced PC users.andP;  Merelycopy the contents of all of the diskettes shipped by Attachmate to a specificsubdirectory, then run the configuration program.andP;  The downside to this isthe amount of disk space this requires, but it is not more than 1MB to 2MBtotal.andM;The second option directs the user to execute the configuration programfirst.andP;  The software then copies only the files required onto the hard diskor a floppy.andP;  Clearly, if disk space or just the confusion of having lots ofunnecessary files is of concern to you, option two should be your choice.andM;Of special interest here is Extra! for Windows because this product controlsthe installation process.andP;  The software handles all of the copying of filesafter first requesting information from users about their emulationrequirements.andP;  The installation program also starts Windows and then createsan application window for the Extra! programs.andP;  PROGRAM CONFIGURATIONandM;Before a 3 270 gateway can operate correctly, both the gateway machine andthe workstations that will be accessing the gateway must be configuredproperly.andP;  This step ensures that the gateway is customized according to theparameters set up on the host computer and that the workstations areconfigured effectively to use the host resources provided by the gateway.andM;In the past, LAN administrators often found themselves hesitantly dialinghost systems personnel to determine what needed to occur at the host topermit connecting a LAN gateway to it.andP;  The answers were often cryptic andnot too helpful.andP;  Today, most LAN gateway vendors, Attach mate included,provide a configuration worksheet written specifically for host programmers.andO;LAN administrators can now simply hand over the worksheet and in return get acomplete description of the parameters needed for connecting their gateway tothe host.andP;  To take advantage of this information, LAN administrators must runthe gateway product's configuration program and enter appropriate parametersinto the gateway software's configuration panels.andP;  GATEWAY CONFIGURATIONandM;With Extra!, users can start the configuration program for the gateway optionin either of two ways: By running a CONFIG program, which provides atop-level view of all of the Attachmate applications in the currentdirectory, or by running a GATECFG program directly from the DOS commandline.andM;Following the execution of the gateway configuration program, Extra! presentsthe administrator with four menu options that allow customizing the gatewayparameters, host resources, network stations, and connection type.andP;  Extra!andO;lets users select among these options by typing a function key orhighlighting the choice and then pressing andless;ENTERandgt;.andM;In general, the configuration program for an SNA gateway must allowcustomizing the parameters related to the  gateway-to-host  connectionmethod, the number of host sessions supported, and LAN connectioninformation.andP;  In addition, a configuration program typically provides a meansto describe all of the Logical Units (LUs) that will be accessible and howthey will be accessible.andM;This often-critical configuration of a gateway's LUs is always important tothe SNA gateway's successful operation.andP;  Attachmate has done a good job hereby providing flexibility in the configuration of LUs.andM;Another positive aspect of Extra! that becomes clear during thegateway-configuration process appears while selecting the hardware interfacemethod for the host connection.andP;  The Extra! 3270 Gateway supports six coaxadapters, 10 SDLC adapters, and any IBM-compatible Token Ring adapter.andP;  Thisextensive support for various hardware options lets users select the hardwareproducts that most closely meet their needs.andM;One of the hallmarks of Attachmate's strategy is the support for othervendors' (and most often IBM's) 3270 emulation products.andP;  By designing itsgateway to support the IBM emulation programs and giving users a gatewaycapability without also scrapping all their IBM software Attachmate gets itsfoot in the door of IBM accounts.andP;  This strategy support IBM technology andthus allows Attachmate to prove its product features in a much less hostileenvironment.andP;  Attachmate designed this capability into its gateway in such away that it is configured using the same program that customizes Extra!andO;workstations.andP;  On the workstation side, Extra! workstations can connect toIBM gateways as well.andP;  After they have completed the gateway-configurationprocess, users select the type of workstation they will use to connect to thegateway.andP;  They must also customize the programs that permit 3270 emulation atthe workstation.andP;  WORKSTATION CONFIGURATION Extra! 1.42, Extra! Extended forDOS, and Extra! for Windows all can be connected to an Attachmate gateway.andO;Although the basic concepts for connection to the gateway are the same forall three products, Attachmate provides different configuration programs foreach.andP;  The 1.42 version uses an old customization program; Extra! Extendeduses a new program that incorporates pull-down menus and allows defining theinstallation more concisely; and Extra! for Windows is customized as part ofthe program operation under Windows.andP;  Because it represents Attachmate'slatest software for standard DOS machines, we'll focus on the configurationof Extra! Extended for DOS.andP;  As was the case when configuring the gateway, Iwas presented with two choices for configuring my Extra!-connectedworkstation: By running the CONFIG program, which provides a top-level viewof all of the Attachmate applications in the current directory, or by runningthe EXTRA!CFG program directly from the command line.andP;  The workstationconfiguration program provides all the customization for the 3270 emulator,from setting up the number of host sessions-there can be up to four- todefining the hot-key combination that will move users back and forth betweenhost sessions and PC operation.andP;  Most of the configuration process occursdirectly at the first panel, which offers three main sections: Environment,Sessions, and Options.andM;The Environment section gives configuration choices for emulator options,standard or low-memory use, the connection type, keyboard type, language, andvideo selection.andP;  Of these, the emulator and connection type options deservemore attention.andP;  We'll look at the connection-type choice now and leave theemulator options until a little later, when we discuss RAM cram and itseffect on 3270 emulators.andM;After selecting the connection type entry from the onscreen menu, a newscreen that provides choices for the type of connection being made appears.andO;When I selected LAN DFT (Distributed Function Terminal), Extra! presented mewith additional options for selecting the gateway type, station name,resource name, and a keyboard-override option for each host sessionrequested.andP;  This program also presents two other setup options: The first oneis for configuration when running under Windows; the second indicates whetherthe user will use non-IBM-compatible NetBIOS LANS.andM;As with just about everything with this product, when there's a choiceavailable, it's a wide choice.andP;  The connection type option is no different.andO;Extra! permits customization of coaxial CUT  Control-Unit Terminals), coaxDFT, LAN DFT, SDLC DFT, and DLC DFT.andP;  While only one can be selected at atime, this flexibility lets a user change from a coax connection to a LANconnection without having to purchase new software.andP;  Also, most of theoptions support more than one hardware type.andP;  For example, Extra! supportsfive coax adapters for both CUT and DFT emulation.andM;The Sessions section presents a table of the available sessions for thisconfiguration.andP;  This table includes an entry for one PC session, four hostsessions, and two notepad sessions.andP;  Users can customize the PC session for&quot;concurrent&quot; &quot;nonconcurrent,&quot; or &quot;not installed&quot; operation.andP;  Here, concurrentmeans users can keep PC applications &quot;active&quot; while they interact with a hostscreen.andP;  The not installed option allows administrators to restrict machinesto host-only interaction.andM;Extra! gives users four host session options: for session -installed/notinstalled, session name, session type (display or printer), screen size (24lines by 80 characters, 32 x 80, 43 x 80 or 27 x 132), EAB, APL, and graphics(this requires the purchase of a graphics option package).andM;One area that Attachmate has yet to address is support for AdvancedProgram-to-Program Communications (APPC), or LU6.2.andP;  For many, this supportis mandatory which most likely costs Attachmate sales in those accounts.andM;Finally, the sessions section lets you configure two notepads.andP;  This notepadconcept, a carryover from the IBM 3270 PC, is used primarily for moving databetween host and PC screens.andP;  The configuration options for these sessionsare limited to installed/ not installed and session name.andP;  The last section,Options, provides three additional types of configuration variables, startup,color mapping, and advanced features, all of which are user-definable.andP;  Otherthan the Expanded-Memory Specification (EMS) memory option, other importantparameters are API auto-loading functions, mouse support functions, andfile-transfer setup functions.andP;  After completing the gateway and theworkstation(s) configuration process, the LAN administrator can then run thegateway program to connect to the host and execute the workstation programsto begin providing 3270 sessions to LAN users.andP;  GATEWAY OPERATIONandM;The operation of an SNA gateway is a two-step process: First, running agateway control program on a machine connected to an SNA host, and second,running emulation software on workstations that use the LAN to logicallyconnect to the host via the gateway machine.andM;Once the software is loaded on the gateway, the LAN administrator typicallyhas nothing left to do with that machine, because LAN-to-host communicationis often such an integral part of a company's activities that the loss of ahost connection is viewed as a bothersome disruption and the gateway machineruns continually.andP;  For this reason, most vendors, Attachmate included,recommend dedicating  the  gateway machine to its function.andP;  Many companiesoften run a monitoring function on top of their SNA gateway.andP;  With the Extra!andO;3270 Gateway, this built-in function is accessible by pressing the andless;Ctrlandgt;andless;Altandgt; andless;Zandgt; andless;Pandgt; combination.andP;  This key sequence displays a menu that providesoptions for monitoring and managing the gateway machine.andM;Extra!'s nine options here provide monitoring functions, the ability todisplay and alter resource assignments, loading/unloading of the gateway, andan auto-dialing option for SDLC connections.andP;  As a whole, they provide a goodbase of functions.andP;  One suggestion is that Attachmate could enhance theoptions to provide more detailed tracing functions and additional NetViewsupport and management features.andP;  WORKSTATION OPERATIONandM;Most PC users interacting with the Extra! programs will do so with thesoftware running at their own workstation.andP;  Because Extra!, like most 3270emulators, is a Terminate-andStay-Resident (TSR) program, it's often loadedby an AUTOEXEC.BAT file on the user's system.andP;  Once loaded, the 3270 sessionsare no more than a hot-key sequence away.andM;As far as 3270 emulation goes, most products provide the basics very well.andO;To set itself apart from the crowd, Attachmate has done an admirable job intaking advantage of new technologies before many of its competitors.andP;  Forexample, Attachmate was one of the first 3270 vendors to take advantage ofEMS.andP;  Attachmate was the first major vendor to ship a Windows 3270 emulatorand has been a longtime provider of multiple APIs for support of third partyapplications.andP;  Extra! Extended also provides online help that reduces users'dependence on manuals and their LAN administrator.andP;  SOLVING RAM CRAMandM;The plight of RAM cram brought about by DOS's 64OKB limit has plagued PCusers for years, and 3270 emulators are at the top of many corporate users'lists of RAM-consuming culprits.andP;  In response, most vendors-Attachmate beingone of the first-have developed ways to reduce the amount of memory theiremulators require.andM;With Extra! Extended, Attachmate gives users two memory-saving options.andP;  Alow-memory version of Extra! provides basic emulation capabilities, with somerestrictions, while reducing RAM use by about 4OKB.andP;  These restrictionsinclude limiting access to only one display and no printer sessions, nographics support, no windows, no online help, and no APL support.andP;  For manyusers, the restrictions are not critical or the functions surrendured areunnecessary, so this option provides a way to use Extra! in some otherwiseunavailable environments.andM;Another way Attachmate decreases memory requirements of the Extra! emulatoris by all take advantage of any EMS memory available by placing certainExtra! services into high RAM.andP;  This feature provides memory relief only forspecific Extra! modules, including Low Level API, High Level Language API,Server Requestor Program Interface, and Background File Transfer.andP;  RAMsavings will vary according to which of these functions you're using.andM;In combination, these two memory enhancement  schemes can extend your PC'savailable RAM, thus allowing you to run more applications.andM;One way to reduce RAM use temporarily is to run the UNLOAD utility.andP;  Thisutility permits removing some parts of Extra! Extended without breaking themainframe connection.andP;  Be sure to review the Extra! documentation beforeusing this option, however.andP;  FILE TRANSFERandM;One of the most common needs of 3270 users is transferring data between theirPC and the mainframe.andP;  Attachmate engineered Extra! Extended to support thisneed through various methods.andP;  First, Attachmate provides a version of theindustry standard Send/Receive programs for basic file transfer to TSO, CMS,and CICS hosts.andM;Various options give Extra! improved file-transfer capabilities.andP;  One option,a background file-transfer function, allows a PC-host file transfer to occurwhile another PC application continues to operate.andP;  In addition, Extra!andO;Extended provides support for file transfer to IBM's DISOSS through PS/CICSand the &quot;Transfer&quot; command.andP;  GOOD AND RELIABLE Attachmate's gateway andworkstation programs provide very good, very reliable emulation capabilitiesand support user's needs in most all IBM host environments.andP;  By being thefirst major vendor to offer a Windows emulator, Attachmate set the pace forwhat has become the hottest topic in the 3270 emulation business this pastyear.andP;  By quickly implementing its product to take advantage of new PCtechnologies, Attachmate responded to the needs of a broad class of users.andM;On the downside, lack of LU6.2 and more robust NetView support could belimiting factors in the future.andP;  For now, however, Attachmate and its Extra!andO;3270 products more than satisfy the needs of the majority of 3270 users andthey should continue to do so for the foreseeable future.andP;  9</TEXT></DOC>
