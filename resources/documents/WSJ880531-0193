Michael Dukakis views &quot;foreign policy as primarily a legal exercise&quot; and claim that he was rebuked by a federal court in Dukakis v. Department of Defense for &quot;trying to enlist the aid of the judicial branch&quot; in that enterprise. Both your legal analysis and your historical perspective are wide of the mark.    Gov. Dukakis argued that the Constitution's express reservation to the states of &quot;the authority of training the militia&quot; (Art. I, Sec. 8) prevented the federal government from using members of a state's National Guard -- under the guise of &quot;training&quot; them overseas and without the state's consent -- to pursue administration policies in Central America. Far from treating that issue as a &quot;political question&quot; unfit for judicial resolution, the district court wrestled to resolve the conflict between the constitutional clause giving states power over training the militia and the clauses empowering the federal government to raise and control regular armies.    And, far from &quot;laughing&quot; the Dukakis position &quot;out of court,&quot; as you assert, the court in fact accepted the governor's basic position that the militia clause limits congressional power in this area. It conceded that a &quot;plain reading of the Constitution supports plaintiff's contention that Congress cannot 'abolish' the militia by transforming it into part of the Army,&quot; although the court ultimately concluded that the &quot;narrow&quot; issue of federal control over peacetime training of the National Guard should be decided in the federal government's favor.    Your intimation that Gov. Dukakis was trying to use the courts to foist a liberal, legalistic foreign policy on the nation is wholly belied by the facts: The first governor to resist the Reagan administration's supposed &quot;training&quot; of state National Guard units in Honduras was California Republican George Deukmejian, who joined at least 20 state legislatures and a dozen governors of all political persuasions over the past three years in challenging militia deployments abroad without state consent.    In an era when Latin American policy is conducted out of the White House basement by officials who profess their dedication to preserving &quot;plausible deniability&quot; for the president, Mr. Dukakis's interest in accountability within our constitutional order can hardly be dismissed as naive. The governor argued that the administration's goal in deploying the National Guard next door to Nicaragua was &quot;to avoid accountability: by claiming to be training troops, they may refuse to state the foreign-policy purposes they are attempting to achieve.&quot;    Such evasion, even when authorized by Congress, undermines the democratic principles that animated the Framers' creation of a citizen army subject to the joint authority specified in the Constitution. Indeed, the administration finally admitted in court what it had previously sought to obscure: that the Constitution's reservation of state power over National Guard training did not matter, because the administration was exercising the separate presidential power to &quot;determin{e} our national policy with respect to Central America&quot; and to &quot;us{e} the National Guard . . . as an instrument of that foreign policy.&quot;    But the value of the Dukakis lawsuit does not depend upon whether the court should have granted the precise relief the governor sought. For much of the Constitution's interpretation has flowed from suits in which public officials, seeking to test matters of power and responsibility, have taken positions vindicated by history even if not by the lawsuits themselves. Thus, in a federal suit brought in 1793, John Hancock, the first governor of Massachusetts, urged that a state may not be sued in such a tribunal without its consent. That principle -- in the form of the 11th Amendment -- was ultimately recognized as a cornerstone of our federal system. And when Barry Goldwater in 1979 challenged President Carter's power to rescind a treaty without Senate concurrence, the nation's foreign-policy jurisprudence was enriched, not trivialized, by the Supreme Court's explanation in that case of why treaty revocation should be left to the political branches to resolve.    Perhaps the most important Supreme Court decision ever rendered was one in which the plaintiff, an office seeker, was ultimately denied the relief he sought. In William Marbury's suit against Secretary of State James Madison, the Supreme Court held that the Executive Branch must obey the law and that the judiciary, in saying &quot;what the law is,&quot; must keep Congress as well as the Executive from crossing constitutional boundaries. If the Journal had been around when Marbury v. Madison was decided in 1803, it might have opined that Marbury's lawsuit, like that of Michael Dukakis, was &quot;an odd test case.&quot; But it is precisely through such cases that we come to govern overselves as a nation under law.
