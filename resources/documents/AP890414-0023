The Air Force previously has sought to ease public concernsabout nuclear weapons on the rails bysaying such missiles wouldleave their armed garrisons only in times of crisis.   But the influential Defense Science Board said that plan wouldbe more likely to provoke the Soviets or any other adversary.   ``The problem with keeping them in the garrison at all times isthat a president could raise tensions higher simply by sending thetrains out _ and wouldn't be prepared to take that risk,'' onesource said Thursday.   ``That doesn't help your nuclear deterrent any. But if you haveat least a few out there all the time, the Soviets know you'reserious and that you've got a mobile missile that they can't strikefirst.''   The review by the science board was first reported Thursday bythe Los Angeles Times. The Defense Department declined publiccomment on the matter.   The Bush administration _ like Reagan administration before it _is struggling to develop a plan for adding a mobile nuclear missileto America's arsenal. The idea is to make it more difficult for theSoviet Union to target U.S. forces and thus deter Russia from everconsidering a first-strike attack.   The Air Force and Pentagon have told Congress they would like tobuy 50 more huge MX missiles and place them on rail-car launchers.Congressional Democrats, however, would prefer to see thedevelopment of a small, one-warhead Midgetman missile that could bedeployed on a truck launcher.   Proponents and critics alike agree that placing 50 new MXmissiles on rail cars would be vastly less expensive, about $12billion, compared with almost $25 billion for 500 Midgetmanmissiles. But there is also agreement that a Midgetman force wouldprobably be more survivable against attack.   That is because the Air Force, in pushing for mobile MXmissiles, has always stressed it would mollify public safetyconcerns by keeping the missiles inside armed garrisons _ ready fordispersal on the regular rail network only at times of high tension.   It is that assumption that the science board is preparing tochallenge, said one source.   The board, comprised of respected civilian scientists andengineers along with former defense officials, ``has not submitteda final report yet and probably won't for awhile,'' said one source.   ``But it does look like they're raising an issue that getspeople excited up on Capitol Hill.''   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the Armed ServicesCommittee, said Thursday he already had heard ``rumblings'' aboutthe proposal.   ``It's a way of justifying rail mobile,'' McCain said. ``Thecomplaint has been that they don't have enough warning time. Bykeeping some of them in motion, there's much greater flexibility.''   McCain, who opposes the idea of trying to fund both the MXmissile and the Midgetman, said the proposal will likely surface inthe first debate ``to lend support to rail garrison.''</TEXT></DOC>
