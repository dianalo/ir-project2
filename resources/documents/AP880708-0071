Col. William R. Higginswas planning a mission to rescue American hostages in Beirut beforehe was abducted by pro-Iranian forces, a PLO official was quoted assaying today.   The rescue plan was disclosed in a transcript of Higgins'interrogation by his captors, Bassam Abu Sharif, a PalestineLiberation Organization spokesman, was quoted as saying in theBeirut daily Ad-Diyar.   ``We have seen a transcript of the interrogation of Higgins,''he was quoted as saying.   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was chief of a 76-member observergroup attached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon when he waskidnapped near the southern port city of Tyre on Feb. 17.   A pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group calling itself theOrganization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed responsibility forHiggins' abduction, charging he was a CIA spy.   The United States and the U.N organization have denied thecharge.   ``We know from seeing the transcript of the interrogation ofHiggins ... that he was preparing a large-scale operation under theslogan of rescuing all the American hostages (in Lebanon),'' AbuSharif was quoted as saying in the newspaper, which is based inChristian east Beirut.   Abu Sharif did not say how the PLO obtained the purportedtranscript.   He also was quoted as saying that Higgins ``had headed theoperations department of the U.S. Delta Force and had arrived inLebanon wearing (the U.N.'s) Blue Beret.''   The Delta Force is better known as the Rapid Deployment Force, aU.S. group set up to act against terrorism and other threats toAmerican interests.   He also said the ousting from Beirut of guerrillas loyal to PLOChairman Yasser Arafat's was part of a ``Syrian-American plan.''   Arafat's loyalists Friday left the refugee camp of Bourjel-Barajneh, their last stronghold in Beirut, after it fell toSyrian-backed PLO dissidents of Col. Saeed Mousa's Fatah-Uprisingfaction.   Eighteen foreign hostages are believed held in Lebanon,including nine Americans. The longest held is 40-year-old Terry A.Anderson of Lorain, Ohio.   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Most of the hostages are believed held by factions loyal toHezbollah, or Party of God, a pro-Iranian Shiite group.</TEXT></DOC>
