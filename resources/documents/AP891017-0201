They will face off in the Candidates' final, set for March inLondon, with the winner challenging world champion Garri Kasparovof the Soviet Union for his title in a 24-game match startingOctober 1990.   Karpov and Timman each won by 4.5 points to 3.5. A win scoresone point and a draw half a point.   Karpov, 38, who held the world title for 10 years until losingto Kasparov in 1985, scored a crushing semifinal last-round victoryover fellow Soviet Artur Yusupov in 53 moves.   Timman, 37, defeated Jon Speelman of England in 54 moves after azigzag battle.   After leaving the stage at the Sadler's Wells ballet theater,Karpov told a news conference the quality of play in his matchagainst Yusupov and in Timman's match against Speelman was poor.   Asked to comment on Kasparov's claim that the world championwouldn't face a difficult challenge in 1990, Karpov replied: ``Ifwe play on the same level as here, he has no rival. But I don'tthink we shall play this level of chess all the time.''   Timman told a later news conference he felt psychologicallystronger after the match.   Asked about his chances of beating Karpov, Timman said: ``Inever say before the match what I think my chances are.''   Karpov and Timman will each receive $77,000 for their play inthe semifinal. Yusupov and Speelman will each receive $46,200.   A German computer company has offered a prize of 1 million Swissfrancs ($616,000) to the first Westerner to win the Candidates'final and challenge Kasparov.   Playing with the advantage of white, Karpov returned to formafter a lackluster showing in the first seven games.   Kasparov said by telephone from Los Angeles that Karpov deservedto lose his match against Yusupov.   He cited a winning continuation missed by Yusupov in the sixthgame, which could have catapulted Yusupov into the lead.   On Tuesday, an inferior continuation from Yusupov on the 17thmove let in Karpov's pieces to swarm around Yusupov's king.   On the 24th move, Karpov sacrificed a knight to rip open thepawn cover around Yusupov's king.   Yusupov eventually emerged two pawns behind in a hopelessendgame.   Playing white in an English opening, Speelman gained aninitiative after an early exchange of queens and could have won apawn on the 19th move, experts said.   But playing for bigger stakes, Speelman steered the game intocomplications.   With Timman having only 10 minutes for his last 13 moves,Speelman made a weak 28th move that let Timman gain a pawn on the31st move.   Timman won a second pawn following a weak 45th move fromSpeelman.   Nine moves later, Speelman resigned.</TEXT></DOC>
