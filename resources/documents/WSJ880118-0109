The Labor Department's producer price index for finished goods fell 0.3% last month -- the biggest drop since the 0.8% decline in July 1986 -- after being unchanged in November and falling 0.2% in October. For all of 1987, producer prices rose a modest 2.2% after falling 2.3% in 1986. A major factor was energy prices, which rose 10.2% last year after plunging 38% in 1986.    Separately, the Federal Reserve Board said output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2% in December after a 0.4% increase in November and a 1.1% jump in October. For the year, average annual output rose 3.8% after increasing 1.1% in 1986 and 1.9% in 1985.    In a third report, the Commerce Department said business inventories increased a sharp 0.8% in November after a 1.1% jump in October. The ratio of inventories to sales rose to 1.51 from 1.49.    Referring to the price decline, Robert Wescott, vice president at Alphametrics Corp. in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said, &quot;The clear message here is that there is no cause for undue alarm on prices in the short run. This is a good inflation report.&quot;    President Reagan told reporters that &quot;industrial production is up, inflation is down and this country continues on a long trend of sustained growth with low inflation.&quot;    Inflation looks less dormant, however, if sharp declines in food and energy prices in December are excluded. Without those volatile categories, the index was up 0.4% last month after being unchanged in November. Many economists consider this gauge a better measure of the underlying inflation rate.    Energy prices fell 1.9% in December after a 0.8% drop in November. Food prices declined 1.3% after rising 0.3%.    Prices of intermediate goods rose 0.2% in December after a 0.4% November increase, while prices of crude goods dropped 0.3% after a 1.7% decline.    The monthly figures in all three reports are adjusted for seasonal variation. Before adjustment the index of producer prices for finished goods stood at 296.8% of its 1967 average, down 0.4% from November but up 2.2% from a year earlier.    The rise in industrial production was restrained by a drop in auto assemblies to an annual rate of 6.5 million units in December from a November rate of 7.1 million units. The output of business equipment fell 0.3%; it was unchanged in November. The Fed said output in the past two months has been boosted by continued gains in supplies for construction and business, while production of automotive products and business equipment has weakened.    Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. in New York, said the report &quot;looks pretty good,&quot; although he said the weakness in business equipment bears watching. He said the statistics -- along with a separate Commerce Department report showing big increases in exports in October and November -- suggest that the strong production in the fourth quarter went to overseas markets and domestic inventories, as domestic demand slowed.    While a buildup in inventories would contribute to growth in the economy in the fourth quarter, it also raises the possibility of a slowdown in production in the current quarter. The Commerce Department will release its initial estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth Jan. 27.    Speaking on ABC-TV's &quot;This Week With David Brinkley&quot; program yesterday, Commerce Secretary C. William Verity predicted that 1988 would be a year of &quot;less consumption and more export, and this will be very helpful&quot; for the economy.    The Fed said output of consumer goods edged up 0.1% in December after a 0.2% rise in November.    Manufacturing output rose 0.2% after a 0.5% gain. Mining output increased 0.2% after slipping 0.1%. Utility production fell 0.4% after a 0.7% rise. The industrial production index stood at 133.3% of its 1977 average in December, up 5.2% from a year earlier.    The November rise in inventories was accompanied by a 0.2% drop in sales, which were unchanged in October. Inventories rose substantially in the latest month for retailers, manufacturers and wholesalers.
