Tuesday announced the firstworld-wide licensing agreement of the HP-UX operating system for use withtelecommunications equipment.andM;The contract is projected to generate several hundred million dollars inadditional revenues for the two companies during the next few years.andM;HP-UX will be used with Northern Telecom's current DMS SuperNode switchingsystems, and with the company's emerging S/DMS fiber-optic transmission andS/DMS broadband switching products.andM;Northern Telecom's decision to use HP-UX, an open architecture computingplatform, will become increasingly important as the Advanced IntelligentNetwork (AIN) market evolves and users choose to access new services fromtelephone companies.andM;HP-UX will provide a tighter integration of general purpose computers andtelecommunications systems, allowing telephone companies to connect HP andother manufacturer's workstations and minicomputers.andP;  HP-UX will alsofacilitate the use of industry standard, third party software on NorthernTelecom's products, thus reducing development intervals, ensuringapplications portbility, and resulting in more cost-effective enhancedservice introduction.andM;The implementation of the HP-UX operating system across the operations,administration, maintenance and provisioning (OAMandamp;P) aspects of NorthernTelecom's DMS SuperNode and S/DMS products will allow telephone companies tofurther streamline their network operations, reduce operating costs andincrease revenues.andM;For example, offering a common &quot;look and feel&quot; across various products willreduce training requirements and allow faster, more efficient serviceintroduction.andM;&quot;By providing a standard, open operating environment, Northern Telecom willbe able to introduce new products and services more quickly,&quot; said John Roth,executive vp, product line management, Northern Telecom Limited.andM;&quot;Our customers will also benefit from the flexibility being designed into theoperational aspects of our DMS SuperNode and S/DMS products.andP;  We chose theHP-UX operating system in light of Hewlett-Packard's commitment to quality,industry standards, strength in UNIX computing and high reliability products,all of which are mandatory in our business.&quot;andM;&quot;The integration of computers and switching systems is an excellent exampleof the convergence of the telecommunication and computing industries,&quot; saidWillem P. Roelandts, HP vp and general manager of Computer Systems Group.andO;&quot;By providing a better, more open way to integrate computers and switchingsystems, we are helping to shape the technologies of tomorrow.&quot;andM;Key benefits of an open systems environment, such as those provided by HP-UX,include compatibility with a wide range of computer systems already beingused by telecommunications companies; an easier, faster and less costly wayfor software developers to build their products, and; easier customization ofOAMandamp;P functions by telecommunications companies to provide a better fit withtheir own unique operations network.andM;HP-UX will be used within Northern Telecom's transmission products in thefourth quarter of 1990, and on its access and switching products in 1991.andO;HP-UX is based on, and fully complies with ATandamp;T's UNIX system.andM;Northern Telecom is the leading global supplier of fully digital switchingsystems.andP;  Its revenues in 1989 were approximately $6.1 billion.andM;HP has 93,000 employees and had revenues of $11.9 billion in its 1989 fiscalyear.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
