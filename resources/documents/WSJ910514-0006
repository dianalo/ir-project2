Tokyo stocks closed lowerin thin trading. London shares finished just above the day'slows.   In Tokyo, share prices failed to sustain midday gainshelped by arbitrage buying, as an overall bearish mood wasprompted by Friday's plunge in New York and by anunexpectedly poor business performance prediction for PioneerElectronic. The Nikkei 225-share index, which lost 164.21points Friday, fell 181.09 to 26093.20, just above theintraday low. The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of allfirst-section issues, which gained 1.30 points Friday, fell13.37 to 1977.78.

Pioneer shares plunged 12.6%, Monday's biggest percentageloss, to 4,370 yen ($31.43), off 630 yen, on a weekend reportthat the company's unconsolidated pretax profit for thefiscal year ending next March will decline 21% from a yearearlier. Pioneer's wounding led to selling of otherhigh-technology shares. Sony lost 180 to 6,080 and TDK fell140 to 5,520.   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-shareindex fell 37.7 points to 2486.6. The FT 30-share index lost31.9 points to 1942.6. Volume was thin at 353.8 millionshares, compared with 423 million shares in the previoussession.   The Sydney exchange registered a 1.6% loss, taking its cuefrom New York stocks' poor showing Friday. Singapore sharesfell almost 1%, and Taipei's market declined for the thirdsession in a row. Following suit, European bourses generallyeased. But in Milan, share prices were lifted by the market'spositive reaction to Sunday's one percentage-point cut in theBank of Italy official discount rate to 11.5%.   Among corporate developments, Brent Walker Group plunged16 pence to 40 pence (69 cents) in London. The financiallytroubled leisure concern said it expects to report asubstantial after-tax loss for 1990. Analysts expect thecompany to disclose a write-down in the value of its propertyand assets to about #100 million ($1.7 million) from #1.1billion. Brent Walker also said talks with its bank lenderson restructuring its borrowing are continuing.   BET eased 2 to 178. The industrial services concern agreedto sell its Biffa wastemanagement unit to the British waterutility Severn Trent for #212 million. The deal reduces BET'sdebt to less than #300 million from #617 million as of Sept.29 and its ratio of debt to shareholder funds to about 50%from 122%. Severn Trent closed at 277, down 3.   In Frankfurt, where share prices ended modestly lower inlistless trading, Lufthansa fell 90 pfennigs to 130.60 marks($75.75). The airline, 51.6%-owned by the German state, willpost a steep drop in profit for 1990, a Lufthansa seniorexecutive said, citing effects of the Persian Gulf crisis.The company had 1989 earnings of 110 million marks ($63.8million). But he said that the carrier's operating loss willbe small relative to the airline industry's results, and thatLufthansa expects a substantial improvement in commercialtraffic in the second half.   Volkswagen declined 2 to 364. The auto giant plans toinvest 100 billion Spanish pesetas ($939.8 million) in itsSpanish subsidiary to boost production of its Polo model. VWhopes to shift the Polo's production from Germany to thePamplona factory of the Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles deTurismo unit and to increase by 1993 daily output to 1,200Polos, nearly double SEAT's current production.   In Paris, Thomson-CSF shares closed at 156.40 Frenchfrancs ($26.82), off 0.70. The electronics and defenseequipment concern said first-quarter consolidated revenuefell 7.4% to 7.56 billion francs ($1.29 billion). The parentcompany, Thomson, posted a 7.7% decline in consolidatedrevenue for the first three months to 15.4 billion francs,though it cited differences from the yearearlier resultsowing to exchange-rate fluctuations and changes in thegroup's structure. On a comparable basis, the decline wouldhave been 7.8%.   Cie. de Suez fell 2.20 to 349. The diversified companysaid it could sell part of its Banque Indosuez unit tooutside investors. The group has a restructuring programunder way, including asset sales at its Societe Generale deBelgique unit.   L'Air Liquide declined 8 to 677. The gases company said itwants to sell its 52% interest in Societe Lyonnaise etIndustrielle Pharmaceutique S.A., or Lipha, a Frenchpharmaceutical concern. Lipha, which had 1990 consolidatedsales of 2.2 billion francs, specializes in cardiovascular,diabetes and gastrointestinal drugs. L'Air Liquide said theLipha sale would allow it to concentrate on its coreindustrial gases business, and would inject cash to allowpursuit of internal and external growth.   Peugeot dropped 2 to 570. The auto maker's first-quarterrevenue fell 12% to 38.7 billion francs, partly because ofweaker demand in most European markets and an inventoryreduction program.   In Milan, the central bank's discount-rate cut came inresponse to a government spending measure passed Saturday,designed to keep this year's budget deficit to 132 trillionlire ($101.81 billion). It also adjusted Italy's key officialinterest rate to market rates, which have come down steadilyin recent months. In the Italian banking sector, stocks had agood performance, led by Mediobanca, which rose 220 lire to15,710 lire ($12.12), and Banca Commerciale Italiana, or BCI,which added 85 to 4,755.
