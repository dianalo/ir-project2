King Jr.'s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, musical excerpts from Bach'sBrandenburg Concertos, and samplings of bird calls.andM;Britannica Software of Chicago sells the Encyclopedia CD for $895, and theonly special hardware you need on the VGA-equipped 2500 XL is an optionalCD-ROM drive.andP;  It requires the DeskMate interface built into the PC's ROM, soyou can't run it on any other PC.andM;It's becoming easier to see how multimedia presentations will revolutionizebusiness meetings in the next few years.andP;  And it's only a matter of timebefore the right mix of hardware and software for the home makes the Nintendosystem look like a Hula-Hoop.andM;ISDN Gets TestedandM;in the HomeandM;ISDN's slow, inexorable march across America has made its first foray intohome-office computing.andM;IBM and U.S.andP;  West have set up a pilot project that connects a handful ofprivate homes with host computers at the residents' offices using IBM's 7820ISDN Terminal Adapter at both ends.andP;  The test will provide a19,200-bit-per-second link at first, with plans to push the line up to a64,000-bps connection.andM;Businesses are more likely candidates than homes for a digital phoneconnection that will provide faster data transfer rates and the ability torun several connections simultaneously (voice or data).andP;  A large office'scentralized access to the phone system also makes the ISDN conversion morepractical than largescale residential rewiring.andM;To convert the bulk of the United States phone service to ISDN will meanequipment changes in the field, since repeaters and loading coils thatenhance today's analog signals will need to be removed.andM;E-Mail BridgesandM;Under StudyandM;The leading e-mail services are getting together on a plan to bridge theseparate networks.andP;  This month a task force, which has been dubbed theDirectory Services Consortium, is meeting to try and devise an interconnecteddirectory that will be available from all of the participating networks.andP;  Thegroup is comprised of representatives from ATandamp;T, IBM, MCI, BritishTelecom/Tymnet, CNCP Canada, General Electric, Pacific Bell, Teleglobe, USSprint, and Western Union.andM;The goal is to let a subscriber of any of the member networks communicatedirectly with members on other services.andP;  There are a few bridges already inplace between some of these services, but they're cumbersome; most of thenetworks have no bridges at all.andM;New Tack for WangandM;Wang's search for new markets is bringing it to the same channel that haslaunched a hundred entrepreneurs: mail order.andP;  The company that made wordprocessing famous has started a new division in Taiwan to build a line of286, 386SX, and 386 PCs with the name WLT Express PCs.andP;  Wang's innovativegraphics tablet cum desktop environment Freestyle has been going nowheresince its introduction last year, and the company is undergoing arestructuring that is intended to make it a significant force in the personalcomputer market.andM;TrueType Claims Speed,andM;PostScript Claims IBMandM;Heavy maneuvers took place in the battle to control PC font standardsrecently (see Pipeline, November 28, 1989).andM;Microsoft stepped up the timetable for delivery of its font technology inOS/2 to later this year and gave it a formal name, TrueType (it has gone bythe code name &quot;Royal&quot; until now).andP;  Microsoft also promised to includeTrueType in future versions of Microsoft Windows and said that it expectedmajor software publishers to include the font manager in DOS character-basedprograms, too.andM;Microsoft is seeking to win over developers by providing results of its owntesting that show TrueType to be far faster than PostScript.andP;  And Microsoftis trying to convince software developers that writing interfaces to theTrueType page description language will be easier and more efficient sinceTrueType's commands will be accessed from inside the operating system.andP;  Italso maintains that despite Adobe's recent publication of &quot;The PostScriptspecifications,&quot; programmers still cannot access PostScript's proprietaryalgorithm for font hinting.andM;Adobe, meanwhile, convinced IBM to build Display PostScript into the emergingfamily of graphical SAA interfaces, including AIX and OS/2 software.andP;  IBMalso promised to support TrueType, but only on PS/2s.andM;If you find this sorry state of affairs confusing, there's some consolation.andO;Microsoft says that TrueType will have no problem printing out to PostScriptprinters.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
