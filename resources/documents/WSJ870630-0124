Rates have dropped slightly in recent weeks, and economists generally expect sales to have improved somewhat in June. But several economists said they are lowering their sales forecast for the year in response to the mortgage-rate rise and the sales weakness that already has occurred.    The drop, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 616,000, followed a revised 1% rise in April to a rate of 724,000. The department previously put the April gain at 7.6%. The drop left sales 20.7% below May 1986. In January 1982, sales fell 19.5%.    &quot;Home sales were pretty bleak, and it's almost certainly due to the very sharp runup in rates,&quot; said Martin Regalia, chief economist at the National Council of Savings Institutions. &quot;It's putting a pretty healthy crimp in the housing market.&quot;    He said he plans to cut his home-sales projection for 1987, noting that the sales weakness came at a time when home building and housing sales are generally strong.    Lyle Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, said: &quot;With rates having come down somewhat since the third week in May, we will see a slight improvement in sales. But we won't get back to the first-quarter level.&quot; He said that currently he expects sales of about 675,000 for 1987, down from his previous forecast of around 700,000.    The report also showed that the average price of a new home jumped 10.3% to a record $129,600 last month from $117,500 in April. The median price increased 9.1% to $106,800 from $97,900. May marked the first time the median price topped $100,000. Several economists suggested that these increases indicate that home buyers who remained in the market after the rate surge tended to be wealthier people who purchased more expensive homes.    James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, was more bullish, saying he wasn't ready to lower his sales forecast of 700,000 for the year. Among other factors, he said that housing remains affordable for people who use adjustable-rate mortgages.    Also, he said the rise in sales of existing homes last month suggests that &quot;housing demand is still there.&quot; The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales rose 5.1% in May.    By region, the biggest drop in new-home sales came in the Midwest, where they fell 35% in May after a 14% drop in April. In the South, sales were down 13% after a 0.7% rise. In the Northeast, sales fell 10.3% after a 7.1% drop. Sales declined 9.5% in the West after rising 0.5%.    The department said there was a 7.1-month supply of unsold houses at the end of May, up from a 5.9-month supply in April.    Before seasonal adjustment, sales in May totaled 58,000, down from 71,000 in May. </TEXT></DOC>
