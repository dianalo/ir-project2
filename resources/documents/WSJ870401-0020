A federal bankruptcy court judge yesterday denied Coastal Corp.'s request for a court order barring TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp. from conducting what Coastal termed a &quot;smear campaign&quot; to thwart Coastal's plan to reorganize TransAmerican and acquire it.    Coastal claimed that information being circulated by TransAmerican might prejudice creditors and state politicians against Coastal's plan to take over TransAmerican through a reorganization proposal it will submit as a part of TransAmerican's Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings. Under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a company is shielded from creditors while it attempts to reorganize.    In denying Coastal's request at a hearing yesterday, Judge Manuel D. Leal cited TransAmerican's First Amendment rights to free speech. He said that both TransAmerican and Coastal were free to make public statements about the case, as long as the companies didn't solicit commitments from individual creditors to approve their competing reorganization plans for TransAmerican.    Both companies said that the ruling would likely intensify their rhetorical war. &quot;That means the barriers are off of us, too,&quot; said a spokesman for Coastal, an oil and gas concern.    &quot;It's obviously going to heat up,&quot; said John Nabors, an attorney representing TransAmerican. TransAmerican, the successor to GHR Energy Corp., has already sued Coastal for $2 billion in a state court, accusing it of interfering with TransAmerican's own reorganization plan. GHR filed for bankruptcy-law protection in 1983, owing creditors about $1 billion.    In its request, Coastal claimed that through news releases and other statements, TransAmerican was &quot;creating an atmosphere of hostility among the creditors against Coastal.&quot;    Coastal also accused TransAmerican of trying to bring state political officials into the fray. Coastal cited a letter from TransAmerican to the natural gas concern's royalty interest owners suggesting that they contact Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox to express their concerns about Coastal's intervention.    Coastal also accused TransAmerican of influencing the San Antonio, Texas, city council to pass a resolution last week asking Mr. Mattox to &quot;take any available action&quot; to block Coastal's reorganization plan.    TransAmerican denied having a direct role in influencing the city council. &quot;We just let the people of San Antonio know that Coastal and (Coastal Chairman Oscar) Wyatt were trying to gain control over a major Texas gas supplier,&quot; Mr. Nabors said.    Based on its history of strained relations with Texas politicians and consumers, Coastal has reason to be concerned about the intervention of state officials. Many Texans still resent Coastal for its refusal to honor low-price gas supply contracts as prices rose in the 1970s; that saddled consumers with billions of dollars in higher utility bills. The ill will came back to haunt Coastal in 1984, when the intervention of Mr. Mattox helped Houston Natural Gas Corp. avert a hostile takeover attempt by Coastal.    A Coastal spokesman said the company had &quot;patched up&quot; any differences it may have had with Mr. Mattox. But he added: &quot;We don't want to see any political pressures that might prompt him to do something for political reasons.&quot;    Mr. Nabors said TransAmerican had discussed the case with Mr. Mattox. But he added that it is barred by the bankruptcy court from making a specific request that Mr. Mattox issue an injunction restraining Coastal from pursuing its reorganization plan for TransAmerican.    Coastal said its board will be asked to approve its plan for the reorganization of TransAmerican on April 14, and the company expects to file it with Judge Leal the following day. </TEXT></DOC>
