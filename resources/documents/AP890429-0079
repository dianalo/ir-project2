The Most Rev. Robert Runcie, head of the Church of England andspiritual leader of the Anglican church, said the chances offreeing his emissary are ``very difficult in the short term.''   ``But in the long term I remain optimistic,'' said Runcie, whowas in Larnaca for a meeting of the 27 Anglican archbishops.   Waite disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while he was on amission to try to secure the release of foreign hostages believedheld in Lebanon.   ``It is poignant to be so close to Lebanon. I haven't been soclose to Lebanon since Terry disappeared,'' Runcie said during anews conference in a Larnaca hotel, less than 125 miles fromLebanon.   Asked if he had any message for Waite's captors, Runcie said:``Terry Waite always spoke up for the suffering people of Lebanon.If Terry were free, he would be your best ambassador for securing abetter and more hopeful future for all the people of Lebanon.''   Runcie reiterated that ``we will not enter into any deal overthe hostages, we will not pay any ransom, yet we remain alert ifany opportunity offers itself.''   Fifteen hostages are believed held in Lebanon by Shiite Moslemgroups loyal to Iran. They include nine Americans. Longest held isTerry Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
