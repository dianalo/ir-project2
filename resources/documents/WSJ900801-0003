The supply of mature hogs is usually thinnest in thesummer because of the timing of their reproductive cycles.That forces meatpackers to bid up prices to find enough hogsto keep their plants operating.</LP><TEXT>   Reports that cash prices for live hogs were jumping in theMidwest sent prices of futures contracts higher at theChicago Mercantile Exchange. In trading yesterday, the hogcontract for August delivery rose 0.72 cents to settle at61.22 cents a pound.   According to some analysts, U.S. slaughterhouses areoperating at about two-thirds of capacity. Federallyinspected slaughterhouses, which have the capacity to killroughly 365,000 hogs a day, killed only 241,000 Monday.   The seasonal downturn is being exacerbated this summer byan unusually tight supply of hogs. The number of hogsslaughtered last week fell 10% below the comparable 1989week, according to Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G.Edwards andamp; Sons, St. Louis.   After the close of trading, signs emerged that theslaughter increased yesterday. However, the supply offattened hogs probably won't begin to increase significantlyuntil September. The supply usually peaks in April andOctober.   Hog prices have been swinging wildly this year. Aftersoaring to record levels this spring, hog prices gyrated thissummer amid signs that consumers were cutting back purchasesof the high-priced meat.   The price of pork bellies, which are used to make bacon,has been particularly volatile this summer. After weakeningin July, contracts for delivery through mid-1991 jumpedyesterday by their daily limit of two cents a pound.   Despite concerns about weakening demand for bacon, pricesincreased amid signs that the supply of pork bellies isdwindling. According to a weekly survey, 7.1 million poundsof pork bellies were withdrawn from refrigerated warehousesoutside Chicago last week.   The supply of frozen pork bellies, which are refrigeratedfor use primarily during the summer, fell to 48.7 millionpounds in warehouses outside Chicago, compared with 78.2million pounds a year earlier. Another survey tracks frozenpork-belly supplies in Chicago.   So far, hog traders have shrugged off reports that randomtesting by Japan detected sulfamethazine residues in a Juneshipment of U.S. pork. A similar discovery in 1988 depressedprices by sparking speculation that Japan would restrict U.S.pork imports.   Japan, which is the largest buyer of U.S. pork, has toughrules about the presence of sulfamethazine residue in meat.Sulfamethazine, which is widely used to medicate hogs, cancause an allergic reaction in some people and has been linkedto thyroid tumors in some laboratory rats.   So far, the Japanese government has ordered that porkshipments from a handful of U.S. plants be checked andcleared for the residue before being sold in Japan.   Before the discovery, exports of U.S. pork loins to Japanwere running about 25% above 1989 levels, according to theNational Pork Producers Council, which represents hogfarmers. So far, there isn't any sign that U.S. exports areslipping. Among other things, the weakening of the dollar hashelped fuel U.S. pork shipments.   After the 1988 scare, the hog-farmer group launched acampaign to teach its members how to use the drug withouttainting livestock.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum prices were strong, while thoseof gold rose moderately and silver edged lower.October-delivery platinum ended with a gain of $10.80 anounce at $490.90 after trading as high as $492.50. Augustgold was up $2.20 an ounce at $370.00. September silver wasoff 1.8 cents an ounce at $4.8220. The lower dollar, tensionsin the Middle East and, most importantly, buying of platinumby Japanese investors caused the platinum price to surge,according to Nina Lipton, research manager of the PlatinumGuild International, an industry group. &quot;Platinum has becomean excellent hedge in view of prospects of higher oil pricesthat can fuel inflation,&quot; she said. &quot;Also, the weakness ofthe dollar made platinum cheaper in yen terms. This attractedJapanese buying of platinum, which triggered heavyshort-covering&quot; by traders who had sold contracts inanticipation that prices would fall, Ms. Lipton said. Theplatinum surge, as well as the lower dollar, also helpedgold, an analyst said. Silver lagged because, in contrast tothe platinum or gold situation, there's no demand forbullion, she said.                                                                                                          ENERGY: Oil prices mostly rose in light to moderateactivity, with many traders remaining on the sidelines in thewake of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesmeeting. The market moved on a variety of news during theday, most of it bullish. Delegations from Kuwait and Iraqheld their first round of face-to-face talks in Saudi Arabiaover their bitter disputes that threatened to undo lastweek's meeting. Iraq has accused Kuwait of producing beyondits OPEC quota in a deliberate attempt to undermine the Iraqieconomy. Iraq also accused Kuwait of border violations and ofstealing oil from a field that straddles their border.Estimates circulated that Iraqi troops along the Kuwaitiborder now number around 100,000, up from earlier estimatesof 30,000. Also, the U.S. Coast Guard estimated that 500,000gallons of oil have leaked into Galveston Bay in Texas, 10times its original estimate of last weekend's spill. On thebearish side, statistics released by the American PetroleumInstitute after trading ended yesterday showed an unexpectedincrease in crude oil inventories of 2.9 million barrels lastweek.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices were strong, partly because ofreports that frost damaged the Brazilian coffee crop butmostly on technically oriented demand. The September contractsettled with a gain of 3.35 cents a pound at 93.80 cents. Thecurrent 1990-91 Brazilian coffee crop, whose harvest began inMay, isn't in any danger from cold weather or frost. Thecoffee beans are too mature and have been mostly collected.The first buds that will eventually bear the 1991-92 crop,however, are now on the trees, and it is this crop that isvulnerable to cold weather. Last weekend, temperatures in thesouthernmost growing areas of Brazil dropped as low as 34degrees Fahrenheit. It is believed that the cold caused someleaf burn and possibly damaged some of the first buds of thenext crop. However, according to Peter Leavitt, vicepresident of Weather Services Corp., Bedford, Mass., &quot;Coffeetrees lose blossoms all the time. Subsequent blooms can makeup for any early losses.&quot; Milder weather is expected tocontinue, Mr. Leavitt said.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices rose. The September contract gained1.05 cents a pound to $1.2460. Japanese buying of copperfirmed prices in London and subsequently in New York,analysts said. The London Metal Exchange yesterday reported a9,300-ton increase in its copper warehouse stocks to 94,275tons, well above the 7,000-ton increase that had beenexpected. But any price-weakening impact appeared to beoffset by a decline in New York's Commodity Exchangeinventories of 751 tons to 11,522 tons. It was the secondconsecutive daily drop in the New York exchange's warehousestocks. Continuing low global stocks of copper, strongEuropean demand in addition to that from Japan and a drop of2% in primary world mine production in the first five monthsof this year are all contributing to the current strong pricetrend for the metal, according to Fred Demler, first vicepresident of commercial futures at PaineWebber.</TEXT></DOC>
