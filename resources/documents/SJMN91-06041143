It's rightin town, easy to get to, seldom snarled with traffic jams. Silicon Valleybusinesses value its convenience.;    But the things that make it convenientalso limit its growth. It's hemmed in by major highways, and its flight pathscross neighborhoods in San Jose and Santa Clara, where noise is an emotionalissue.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  EXPAND SAN JOSE'S AIRPORTMASTER PLAN MUST BALANCE TRAVEL NEEDS WITHNEIGHBORHOOD CONCERNS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     The city is working on a master plan to guide the airport's growth to 2010,attempting to balance travel needs, neighborhood concerns, and geographicallimitations. Debate on the draft will be lively until a plan is adopted nextfall.;    The draft would triple the current number of air travelers by 2010,to 21.2 million per year. That's a lot more traffic -- not just in planes, butin cars as well.;    But the proposal would cut the activity of small privateplanes at the airport, which is smart. It's crazy to try to squeeze both kindsof aviation into San Jose's limited space. Other airports such asReid-Hillview, unpopular as it is, can serve small planes, but only theinternational airport can serve the jets.;    Noise also is a legitimateconcern, especially since the city is promoting high-density housing downtown.San Jose must continue some curfews and insist the airlines use the quietestkind of aircraft.;    But keeping the airport small is no answer. Planning forgrowth is the answer. If you have a stake in that plan, this is the time tospeak up.;    FOLLOW-UP . . . The next public hearing is at 7 p.m. Tuesday inthe council chambers at San Jose City Hall, 801 N. First St.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910210  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  279  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday February 10, 199100041143,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
