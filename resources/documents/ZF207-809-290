 Yet that is exactly what happened at this year's ComputerPublishing Conference.andM;Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, kicked off the fray with the announcementthat Microsoft and Apple are joining forces on a common outline fonttechnology and a common implementation of PostScript.andP;  John Warnock, chairmanof Adobe Systems, responded with an emotional plea  for users to rise up tosave the dream of a single PostScript standard from the Apple/Microsoftbarbarians.andP;  He supported his plea by announcing that in response to theMicrosoft/Apple challenge, Adobe will give the industry what it has beenbegging for: an open standard for PostScript fonts and aggressive leadershipin advancing the (Adobe) PostScript standard.andM;Steve Jobs, chairman of Next (and a long-time Adobe PostScript supporter),attacked Apple and Microsoft for introducing a new standard that, he claims,promises no significant advantages over the existing (Adobe) standard.andO;Conference attendees voiced strong support for the Adobe position.andP;  Majorfont vendors said that they will support both the Apple and Adobe formats.andM;Hewlett-Packard said that it is too far along with its commitment to theCompugraphic outline font technology to change horse.andP;  Everyone is waiting tosee what IBM will do.andM;What is at stake?andP;  As we discussed in our previous article on the subject(see vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  9), all of this change snuck up on most people in thecomputer industry--and on many people in the publishing industry as well.andP;  Itwas not until they rounded a bend and suddenly came face to face with theimplications of a world built on diverse imaging models and diverse fonttechnologies that they began to realize how crucial these technologies are tothe future of both industries.andM;As should be clear from the &quot;Seybold Manifesto&quot; published in our last issue(Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  1, pp.andP;  3-7), we believe that we are all moving rapidly towarda world in which users will want to communicate rich graphic informationwithin and between organizations.andP;  Since not everyone will have the same kindof computer, this means that we must be able to exchange this informationacross heterogeneous computer systems and to drive the same output devicesfrom different types of computers.andM;The best way to accomplish these goals would be to use the same graphicimaging model and the same font technology on all computers and all outputdevices.andP;  Both are important.andP;  As the PostScript clone vendors discovered totheir horror at last year's Seybold Conference, even if they have a perfectimplementation of the PostScript language, they are not truly compatible withAdobe PostScript devices unless they can use the same type fonts.andP;  This meansthat they have to support the same font technology--something that Adobe wasclearly trying to prevent them from doing.andM;In fact, for most kinds of documents, it turns out that type fontcompatibility is even more important than using the same techniques fordrawing curves, filling patterns and performing other graphic functions.andM;The bulbs light up.andP;  Over this past year, one could almost see the lightbulbs lighting up in the heads of vendor after vendor as they came torealize:andM;* Outline font technology is an essential part of any robust graphicenvironment.andP;  When Larry Tessler of Apple tried to convince attenders at lastyear's Seybold Desktop Publishing Conference otherwise, he was nearly lynchedon the spot.andM;* Users really care about being able to move formatted information fromcomputer to computer and being able to send the same formatted output to anyoutput device from any computer.andM;* If two devices use different outline font technologies (and thereforedifferent font libraries), it will be very difficult to move formattedinformation from one to the other.andP;  To do so, one would have to build twoidentical versions of every typeface, one for each font format.andP;  Thisapproach is plausible if you assume that users need only a small number oftype fonts, but experience has shown that even though any one user mayactually use only a few faces, the total number of faces that will bedemanded by all users is enormous.andM;Behind-the-scenes maneuveringandM;The Computer Publishing Conference announcements and counter-announcementswere the culmination of a spring and summer of intense behind-the-scenesactivity.andP;  After Tessler had been nearly assaulted at the Conference lastSeptember, Apple decided that it would place a higher priority on buildingoutline font technology into its QuickDraw screen imaging model.andM;Apple was already firmly committed to weaning itself from Adobe.andP;  It wasplacing increasing emphasis on evolving QuickDraw into a more robustlanguage.andP;  Adding support for scalable outline fonts was an essential part ofthis plan.andM;Apple had looked at all of the available outline font technologies anddecided that it could do better.andP;  It ended up developing an approach thatrelies on encoding with each character instructions that contain a lot of&quot;intelligence&quot; so that the routine that actually generates the characterbitmap on a screen or on a printer can be simple.andM;Six months after claiming that users do not really need outline fonts, Applestated at the Seybold Seminars in March that it was indeed working on outlinefont technology.andP;  In May, Apple announced to developers that the newtechnology (code-named &quot;Royal&quot;) will be part of the next major systemsoftware release (System 7), which is due out next year.andM;Adobe's response.andP;  As readers may recall, Adobe Systems launched a preemptivecounterattack the week before the Apple announcement by disclosing that ithad developed entirely new rasterizing software that can be added to theApple system software.andP;  Called ATM (Adobe Type Manager), it will use existingType One Adobe outline fonts to generate screen bitmaps on the fly.andP;  It alsoproduces substantially better output than the previous Adobe technology on a300-dpi printer.andM;Unlike Apple Royal font technology, ATM will work with the current ApplySystem 6 software.andP;  Adobe had to &quot;reverse engineer&quot; some of the Apple systemsoftware to make this possible.andP;  Apple (which thus far has regarded ATM asheresy) says that Adobe will have a more difficult time doing the same thingwith System 7.andM;Microsoft makes its move.andP;  Shortly after the Seybold Seminars, Microsoftdecided that it, too, desperately needed to include outline font technologyin its graphic environments and had set the objective for itself of beingable to announce its decision at the Computer Publishing Conference inSeptember.andP;  (See &quot;Font Technology Takes Center Stage&quot; in Vol.andP;  3, No.9.)andP;  Italso decided that, unlike Apple, it would not attempt to invent its own fonttechnology, but would choose from the alternatives already available.andM;Everyone in the business knew that the decision would be momentous.andP;  As notedin the &quot;Pocket History of Font Technology&quot; elsewhere in this issue, Adobe andApple each had their own font formats, Sun had chosen the Folio F3 format,and Hewlett-Packard had allied itself with compugraphic.andP;  This left Bitstreamand The Company (Nimbus-Q) as the principal unaligned candidates.andM;Because of the PC's dominance in the desktop market, whatever Microsoft chosewould become a standard.andP;  Any choice it made would restructure the industry.andO;In the end, out of all the possible alternatives, Microsoft chose the onethat will have the most impact.andM;Why not Adobe?andP;  As we stated in our article in May, users would prefer asingle, open font technology standard.andP;  In fact (as noted above), to behonest, users would prefer a single, open imaging model as well.andM;There was, therefore, considerable unhappiness among Conference attendeesthat Microsoft did not pick the Adobe ATM format.andP;  With so much momentumbehind PostScript and so much investment in PostScript fonts, why introduce asecond (or third) standard?andM;We think it is possible that had Adobe taken the actions it took at thisyear's Conference a year earlier--or even six months earlier, at the MarchSeminars--there might have been so much momentum behind the Adobe format thatit would have been the natural choice.andM;But even this conclusion is not certain.andP;  What is certain is that in thecrucial period this spring and summer, the conflicting business and technicalinterests, commercial realities and personalities could not be reconciled.andO;What Microsoft wanted, Adobe could not give.andP;  What Adobe wanted, Microsoftcould not accept.andM;Three (or more) standards.andP;  It looked for some time, therefore, as though wewould end up with multiple font formats.andP;  Adobe had its format.andP;  Apple hadits format.andP;  Microsoft would select a third font format.andP;  HP and Sun hadtheir font formats, which might or might not turn out to be different fromwhat Microsoft chose.andM;The Microsoft font technology clearly would have become a standard.andP;  Itwould, after all, have been the default standard for every Windows andPresentation Manager PC.andP;  And Microsoft, which by this time had decided thatit wanted to be in the output imaging technology business, would have held itup to all the PostScript clone vendors as the logical alternative to theclosed Adobe font format.andM;However, the market would have been fragmented, with no single font formatstrong enough to drive the others out.andP;  The native Macintosh format and thenative PC format would have been incompatible.andP;  Adobe would still have beenin a strong position because it might have ended up with the only format thatall computers (Macs, PCs and Unix workstations) could accommodate.andM;The Apple/Adobe divorce.andP;  Although Microsoft was already far down anotherpath, Apple's announcement this summer that it was selling its Adobe stockand that it was developing its own PostScript clone opened up a newpossibility.andP;  Microsoft approached Apple, and both companies quickly decidedthat a common course in fonts and imaging technology would be a big win forthe two companies and for their users.andP;  A world that was on the verge offragmenting suddenly coalesced.andM;The allianceandM;This recounting brings us to the drama that played itself out in public atthe Conference.andP;  Rather than leading you blow-by-blow through the first dayof the Conference and its aftermath, we will summarize what emerged from theannouncements, questions, clarifications and debates.andM;Microsoft and AppleandM;* Microsoft has signed an agreement with Apple under which Microsoft willincorporate Apple's Royal outline font technology as the default outline fonttechnology for screen display in OS/2 Presentation Manager.andP;  PresentationManager will generate screen bitmap characters on the fly from the sameRoyal-format character outlines that Apple will use in its Macintosh System 7(see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  9).andM;The Royal technology will also be included in Microsoft Windows for MS-DOS.andO;However, because of memory limitations in MS-DOS machines, it is possiblethat users will have the system precompute screen bitmaps for the font/sizecombinations they intend to use, rather than have them computed on the fly asthey type or edit text.andM;This means that PCs running Windows or Presentation Manager, Macintoshesrunning version 7 or later of the Macintosh system software, all slaveprinters (including both dot-matrix printers and &quot;dumb&quot; ink-jet and laserprinters) driven directly from the host PC or Mac, and all intelligent outputdevices that include Apple or Microsoft technology will use the same fonttechnology and the same font library.andM;This font technology will be a standard part of all of these machines.andP;  Allusers will have to do will be to buy the fonts they want and load them intotheir computers and printers.andM;* Microsoft and Apple will create an &quot;open&quot; font standard.andP;  The font formatwill be published so that anyone can make and market fonts that will run inall of these machines.andP;  The rendering technology will be licensed to anyonewho wants to use it, including printer manufacturers, typesettermanufacturers and other computer system companies.andM;* Although royal will be the standard font technology shipped with very copyof OS/2, Microsoft will provide a mechanism to support other fonttechnologies as well.andP;  The vendor of an output device that uses some otherfont technology can included that technology in the Presentation Manager orWindows printer device driver for his device.andP;  Windows or PM will ask thedevice driver to prepare the required character bitmaps, which will then bepassed to the application program for display on the screen.andM;Microsoft announced the first such arrangement at the Conference: it hasagreed to include support for the Compugraphic Intellifont format (which willbe used by Hewlett-Packard in its upcoming PCL Level 5 LaserJet printers) inthe PCL device drivers.andP;  The same sort of mechanism could be used to supportAdobe-format fonts as well.andM;As noted earlier, Apple has made to such accomodation.andP;  Adobe was able tomake its ATM font technology work with the current Apply System 6 withouthelp from Apple.andP;  Apple warns that it is going to be much more difficult (andmuch more dangerous) for Adobe to pull off the same feat with System 7.andO;Apple says that it has no intention of giving Adobe any help in this effort.andO;It does not want some other company messing around with attaching things toApple system software.andM;* In exchange for the font technology, microsoft will license to Apple thePostScript clone technology that it obtained when it acquired BauerEnterprises earlier this spring (see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  12, p. 33).andM;* In fact, Microsoft now intends to move aggressively into the output imagingtechnology business.andP;  Apple and Microsoft will work to make the microsoftPostScript with Apple Royal font technology the dominant form of PostScript.andO;With input and suggestions form Apple, microsoft intends to extend andenhance its PostScript implementation.andM;By implication, this could well lead to two principal PostScript developmentcenters--Adobe and Microsoft--each promoting a somewhat different form ofPostScript.andP;  Microsoft is not worried about the two versions diverging toogreatly.andP;  It says that this is exactly what has happened in the computerprogramming language business, with the result that each of the two majorcompetitors feels compelled to match features introduced by the other.andM;* The relationship between Apple and Microsoft has changed dramatically.andO;Apple and Microsoft will work closely together on fonts and on the outputlanguages.andP;  But this is just the beginning.andP;  We believe that the agreementpresages a closer working relationship between the two competitors in otherareas as well--which should result in greater compatibility between Macs andPCs and in reduced barriers to mixed Mac/PC environments.andM;* Now that they have their own PostScript, both Microsoft and Apple will beplacing more emphasis on PostScript.andP;  Previously, both companies had beenmoving toward extending their screen imaging languages (GPI for MicrosoftPresentation Manager, QuickDraw for Apple) as output printer languages aswell.andP;  This would have insured tighter compatibility between the screendisplay and hard-copy output, but it would have created a situation in whichMacintoshes could not access GPI printers and PCs could not drive QuickDrawprinters.andM;Both companies still talk about QuickDraw and GPI printers, but now they aretalking primarily about dumb devices that are driven directly by the samesoftware that drives the screen display.andP;  When they talk about intelligentprinters with built-in controllers, both companies now place more emphasis onMicrosoft PostScript (which will use the same font technology used on PCs andMacs and which can be driven by both PCs and Macs).andM;* This still leaves the unpleasant fact that even though they may share thesame font technology and the same font library, we are talking about fourdifferent imaging languages: GDI (Microsoft Windows), GPI (Microsoft OS/2Presentation Manager), Apple QuickDraw and PostScript.andM;These differences must impose some barrier to transparent exchange of graphicinformation.andM;Both Microsoft and Apple say that common font technology is the crucial part.andO;Graphics, they claim, are easier to translate.andP;  Even so, Microsoft didannounce that it intends to make GPI and Microsoft PostScript more similarover time.andP;  because Microsoft and Apple dominate the desktop market, theybelieve that it is almost a foregone conclusion that their common font formatwill become the dominant industry standard.andP;  Other vendors, they believe,will ultimately have to support the Royal font format because they cannotafford to be incompatible with all those millions of PCs and Macs or with allthe Microsoft PostScript printers that the two companies expept to see.andM;In fact, they except that the open Royal font format will rapidly attract allof the clone vendors who have had a hard time cracking the PostScript marketbecause they could not legally use Adobe Type One fonts in their printers.andM;Adobe's responseandM;The Microsoft/Apple alliance is clearly a serious threat to Adobe Systems.andO;Adobe simply had to respond.andP;  Adobe's John Warnock did indeed respond with anemotional and heartfelt speech.andP;  The industry, he said, had come too far onthe basis of a single PostScript standard.andP;  Adobe, he declared, is not goingto see that destroyed.andP;  In particular, Warnock (and, later in the day, ChuckGeschke) announced:andM;* Adobe will publish the entire PostScript language specification, includingthe format for Type One fonts.andP;  This means that the Adobe font format, too,will be &quot;open.&quot;andP;  As with the Apple/Microsoft Royal font format, anyone willbe able to make and sell Adobe Type One fonts.andM;Even more important, any PostScript clone will now be able to build in itsown software that can accept and output Adobe fonts.andP;  Many of the clonevendors have now &quot;reverse engineered&quot; the ability to use Adobe fonts, but fewhave dared to offer this ability to customers for fear of legal retributionfrom Adobe.andP;  Now they need not worry.andM;Although it will take a while for Adobe to prepare all of the documentationfor dissemination, the big club wielded by Microsoft and Apple has convincedAdobe to give the PostScript clone vendors what they have wanted for so long.andO;Bill Gates said that now that Adobe has agreed to make its font formatpublic, even Microsoft may build support for both Royal and Adobe formatfonts into the Microsoft PostScript.andP;  Adobe will continue to collectroyalties on font that are converted to Adobe format using tools licensedfrom Adobe.andP;  It will not try to collect royalties on fonts converted usingother software.andM;* Adobe is proceeding with its new Adobe Type Manager font technology forboth Macintoshes and PCs.andP;  ATM software compatible with the current AppleSystem 6 software will be shipped to end users in October.andP;  The software willrun in a standard 1-MB Mac.andP;  (System 7 will require a 2-MB machine.)andO;Advanced demand from users and dealers has been very high.andM;Warnock committed Adobe to provide ATM for Presentation Manager and Windows.andO;He has also promised that Adobe will do whatever is necessary to make ATMwork with Apple System 7, even if Apple does its best to prevent Adobe fromaccomplishing this.andM;Adobe thus hopes to hold its market position by providing software that willlet both Mac and PC users employ all of their current Adobe-format outlinefonts for screen display as well as output.andM;* Adobe will move aggressively to extend PostScript.andP;  It will document andgeneralize what have previously been specialized extensions, and it will addcompletely new capabilities.andM;Extensions mentioned include standard support for Japanese (two-byte)character coding, Display PostScript enhancements, support for internationalstandard color models, image data compression, and standard provisions forhandling device options.andP;  Adobe intends to move rapidly to keep theinitiative and to force Microsoft into a &quot;catch-up&quot; position.andM;* Adobe will hold a developers' conference this coming spring.andP;  This eventwill give software developers information on what to expect and will presenta forum through which they can provide feedback to Adobe.andM;Thrust and counterthrustandM;Not surprisingly, Steve Jobs, who followed Warnock on the program, threw hiswholehearted support behind the Adobe position.andP;  Royal, he contends, is not aworking product.andP;  In two years or so, it may have been refined to be as goodas ATM is now.andP;  In a few more years, it may be 10% better.andP;  In essence, heargues, the industry should not discard a vital standard for such marginalbenefits.andP;  The principal effect of the Microsoft decision, he said, was torescue Apple from what would otherwise have been a disastrous decision to goits own way on font technology.andM;Jobs was the first (but far from the last) person of the day to throw theball into IBM's lap.andP;  Whatever Bill Gates may think, he argued, it is notMicrosoft but IBM that sets the standards.andP;  IBM is already committed tosupport of Adobe PostScript.andP;  IBM is allied with Microsoft on Windows andPresentation Manager.andP;  What is IBM going to do?andM;Although many people contend vehemently that it is now Microsoft rather thanIBM that sets system software standards for PCs, there was widespreadagreement that Jobs is right, that IBM is now the pivotal player.andP;  Everyoneelse will be watching to see which way IBM throws its weight.andM;IBM.andP;  Not by coincidence, Nick Donofrio, head of IBM's workstation division,was next up to the podium.andP;  We had asked Donofrio to be prepared to state theofficial IBM position on the ruckus.andM;As we expected, he said that the implications across the entire IBM productline were too great and that IBM had not yet had time to formulate aconcerted corporate position.andP;  He did say that the Apple Royal format wouldbe &quot;one of&quot; the font formats supported in the IBM versions of PresentationManager.andP;  He did not say whether or not it will be the IBM-preferred format.andM;User reaction.andP;  Seizing the opportunity, one of the Conference attendersasked for a show of hands on what the 1,700 people present want IBM to do.andP;  Alarge majority indicated that they want IBM to adopt the Adobe font format asstandard.andP;  A considerably smaller number voted for the Microsoft/Appleformat.andP;  A still smaller proportion indicated that they were either undecidedor confused.andM;Hewlett-Packard.andP;  HP is another key player in this game.andP;  The HP LaserJet andits clones dominate the PC laser printer business.andP;  There are at least fivetimes as many LaserJet and LaserJet-compatible printers in use as there arePostScript machines.andM;As we will discuss later in this issue, HP told the Conference attenders thatit is now preparing for the launch next year of LaserJet printers thatincorporate Level 5 of the LaserJet PCL command language.andP;  PCL Level 5 willinclude Compugraphic's Intellifont scalable font technology.andM;HP is too far committed to Intellifont to change course--especially becausethe Royal technology is still unproven.andP;  For the immediate future, at least,it will therefore continue down the Intellifont road.andM;As noted earlier, Microsoft has agreed to include Intellifont technology inthe PCL driver programs for Windows and Presentation Manager so that LaserJetusers can use Intellifont outline fonts on their screens.andM;Microsoft and Apple counterattack.andP;  Later in the day, Nathan Myhrvold ofMicrosoft and Jim Gable of Apple went on the offensive, stressing theimportance of font compatibility between the Mac and the PC, the importanceof an &quot;intelligent&quot; font format (see accompanying box on Royal vs.andP;  Adobe),and the extensibility of the Royal format to include such refinements asnonlinear font scaling, automatic ligature generation and support fornon-Roman alphabets.andM;Most of all, Myhrvold pointed out the magnitude of what Microsoft and Applehad accomplished.andP;  The day before, the industry standard had been jealouslyguarded Adobe &quot;intellectual property.&quot;andP;  Now, suddenly, there were two openstandards, the Microsoft/Apple standard and the Adobe standard.andM;The font vendors.andP;  Linotype, Monotype, Compugraphic and Bitstream allindicated that they will support both the Royal and the Adobe formats.andO;Compugraphic, of course, also supports the Intellifont format.andP;  In keepingwith the new rules of the market, CG announced that it will publish thisformat so that its competitors can make Intellifont format fonts as well.andO;None of the others appeared interested.andM;Of the four, only Bitstream claims to have experience producing Royal formatfonts.andP;  The others said that they are still working on their first Royalformat font and they do not yet know exactly what will be involved.andM;Hint insertion.andP;  On a related note, Compugraphic asserted that there is nosuch thing as automatic insertion of hints that will yield quality results.andO;Bitstream and Mike Parker of The Company disagreed.andP;  Bitstream said that bynext summer it expects to be able to offer to other font foundries a programthat will generate Apple Royal format fonts automatically.andP;  The Company wasdemonstrating on the exposition floor a package for the automatic conversionof unhinted font outlines into hinted Adobe Type One format.andM;It is still possible that other font formats will survive, but there will beincreasing market pressure for all major vendors to line up behind one of thetwo principal ones.andM;What does it mean?andM;We believe the Microsoft/Apple alliance changes almost everything.andP;  What willthe final outcome be?andP;  There are still many ways things could develop, buthere are our current guesses:andM;1.andP;  It looks as though we are going to have two principal competing forcesdriving PostScript and two competing font standards.andP;  It is still possiblethat other font formats (Intellifont, Sun/Folio F3, Bitstream and/orNimbus-Q) will survive, but we think there will be increasing market pressurefor all major vendors to line up behind one of the two main standards.andP;  Wehave always said we believe that users want a single imaging model and asingle font format, a philosophy expressed succinctly by John Warnock at theConference: &quot;The goal is to be able to ship documents around the world incompletely electronic form.andP;  It simply won't do to have different imagingmodels and different font formats.&quot;andP;  But although that doesn't appear likelynow, in light of the way things have played out, we are optimistic that thecompetition will be healthy.andP;  The threat of direct competition has forcedAdobe to do what no amount of pleading had induced it to do.andP;  The ongoingcompetition is likely to produce a more rapid pace of development and morecompetitive licensing and pricing arrangements than we would otherwise havegotten.andP;  Although it does complicate our lives somewhat, two competingalternatives may turn out to be the optimum number.andP;  It provides healthycompetition without unmanageable chaos.andM;2.andP;  As we indicated earlier, it appears that the Microsoft/Apple allianceactually strengthens the position of PostScript as an output imaginglanguage.andP;  Now that they have their own version of PostScript, it appearsthat both Microsoft and Apple will put more effort into driving PostScript asa common output imaging standard and less effort into pushing their ownscreen display languages (GDI, GPI and Quick-Draw) as output imaginglanguages.andM;3.andP;  We doubt that Microsoft and Apple will drive Adobe out of business.andO;There is clearly a lot of support for Adobe among users, and a lot ofmomentum behind Adobe PostScript and Adobe fonts.andP;  Even people who complainedloudly about Adobe's arrogance, its pricing and its focus on being aprofit-making company bent on serving the interests of its stockholders arerallying behind Adobe.andP;  In the end, the vision of a single output imagingmodel and a single industry-wide font technology has great appeal.andM;4.andP;  If both font formats become well entrenched, we expect to see anincreasing number of devices that will include support for both.andP;  Giveneverything that has happened thus far, it is even conceivable that somedayApple, Adobe and Microsoft will all support both font formats.andM;5.andP;  One of Microsoft's objectives in this whole exercise was to turn the fontbusiness into something like the shrink-wrapped application softwarebusiness.andP;  This transformation requires an open, published standard and alarge enough customer base to make the end-user market attractive todevelopers and marketing organizations.andP;  Apple had similar objectives.andP;  Itappears that these objectives have been met.andP;  If so, we would expect to seethe shrink-wrapped font business grow rapidly.andP;  In the end, we think thatstrong distribution and brand-name recognition will be at least as importantin the font market as they are in the software business.andP;  Some people suggestthat we will even have published reviews of the latest digitized outlineRoyal or Adobe fonts.andM;Where does this leave the competitors?andM;Adobe Systems.andP;  Adobe is getting a surprising amount of sympathy and goodwill now that it is suddenly cast into the unaccustomed role of underdog.andO;There is tremendous respect for everything Adobe has accomplished in creatinga single industry-wide imaging model.andP;  There is also, we think, a strongsense that Adobe has an aesthetic sense and a lasting commitment to providingsolutions that work across the full spectrum of the market, all the way up tohigh-quality output.andM;But we think that Adobe is going to have to remake itself.andP;  It must commititself to a level and open playing field for Adobe-format fonts.andP;  It mustcommit itself to competing on the quality and price of its PostScriptimplementations.andM;It must also move rapidly to seize the initiative to extend PostScript andforce Microsoft into a catch-up position.andP;  It indicated at the Conferencethat it intends to do this.andP;  The logical approach would be to freeze theoriginal definition of PostScript at its current level and to define a newsecond-generation superset that includes all of the extensions (color, datacompression, two-byte character coding, etc.)--&quot;PostScript Level 2&quot; or&quot;PostScript '90&quot; or some such thing.andM;Most of all, to balance Apple and Microsoft, Adobe must get ATM working onthe PC and it must work hard to line up support from the remainingplayers--IBM, Sun, HP, DEC, et al.--who can help bring ATM to Unixworkstations and to a variety of printers.andP;  The winning strategy for Adobe isto position Adobe PostScript and ATM as the technologies that bridge not justthe PC and Mac, but all classes of computer.andM;Besides the user good will, Adobe brings other interesting assets to thefray.andP;  One of the most important is an installed customer base ofAdobe-format typefaces.andP;  John Warnock said at the Conference that there are22 million Adobe-format typefaces in user hands.andP;  Users are going to bereluctant to rebuy their font library in a new format.andM;Microsoft.andP;  Microsoft has come a long way in the past year.andP;  A company with arelentless focus on the office market (and a strong conviction that nicetiessuch as type fonts are not really important to that market) has come torealize that publishers and office workers are really part of the same marketcontinuum and that aesthetics are important.andM;Microsoft has moved quickly, aggressively and decisively to put its new-foundbeliefs into action.andP;  In the process it has crystalized the situation as noother company could have.andM;The Apple deal is a big win for Microsoft.andP;  Together with Apple, it will beable to establish Royal as a de facto font standard and to enhancesignificantly the compatibility between PCs and Macs.andM;Most important of all, from Microsoft's point of view, it is now positionedto be a direct competitor to Adobe as a major force in the output imagingmarket.andM;Many people are unhappy that Microsoft did not choose the Adobe technology.andO;This simply was not going to happen.andP;  It was much more likely that Microsoftwould have moved off on a different course from either Adobe or Apple.andO;Instead, Microsoft and Apple are now on the same course in fonts and outputtechnology.andP;  While they are not on the same course as Adobe, they are atleast on a parallel course.andM;We think that the industry should thank Nathan Myhrvold, Bill Gates, JeanLouis Gassee and John Sculley for acknowledging that users are going to haveheterogeneous computing environments and for moving to bring the PC and theMac closer together rather than driving them further apart.andM;We also think that the industry should thank Microsoft for finding whatappears to be a reasonable solution for supporting alternative fonttechnologies.andP;  We do not know what the limitations will turn out to be, butit appears that users who prefer to use HP/CG Intellifont or Adobe PostScriptfonts on their PC screens will be able to do so.andM;Microsoft indicated at the Conference that it does intend to push its ownversion of PostScript.andP;  It also indicated that it intends to try to convergethe Presentation Manager GPI imaging model and PostScript to reduce thedifferences between PM screen display and dumb printer output on one hand andMicrosoft PostScript printer output on the other.andM;We expect to see Microsoft use its muscle to market its PostScriptinterpreter.andP;  We also expect that it will try to encourage other PostScriptinterpreter vendors to support the Apple/Microsoft font format as thealternative to the Adobe standard.andM;Beyond this, Microsoft, like Adobe, must reach out to bring IBM, HP, Sun andthe other remaining strategic partners into its fold.andP;  It promises to be aninteresting battle.andM;Apple.andP;  The Microsoft selection was at least as big a win for Apple as it wasfor Microsoft.andP;  Apple's font format has now become mainstream.andP;  A majorbarrier to coexistence of Macs and PCs has been removed.andP;  By sharing bothPostScript interpreter code and font technology with Microsoft, Apple is nowin a far stronger position to make its font technology and its PostScriptclone printers successful in the market.andM;We do, however, have one request for Apple: give Adobe the information itneeds to attach ATM to System 7.andP;  Now that Apple has the Microsoft deal, ithas nothing to lose by doing this and it has everything to gain.andP;  If Royaldoes not become an industry standard with both Microsoft and Apple behind it,there is very little else Apple could have done.andP;  If Apple's objective is tosell Macintoshes, giving the user a choice of Royal or ATM (or both) on hisMac will only make the machine more valuable.andM;If Adobe succeeds in making ATM work with System 7 (as we believe that itwill sooner or later), Apple has accomplished nothing except reinforcing theimage of Apple as a &quot;closed&quot; or &quot;proprietary&quot; vendor.andP;  If, on the other hand,Apple really does succeed in holding up ATM for System 7 for someconsiderable period of time, the effect may only be to give users who reallywant to use Adobe fonts a reason to move to the PC (which will support Adobefonts) rather than to a Mac.andM;Right now, what Apple may need most of all is automatic tools for convertingunhinted digitized character outlines into properly hinted Royal formatfonts.andP;  It is actively looking for ways to fill this need.andM;Who to watchandM;As we noted above, many situations still must play out.andP;  Here are the keyplayers to watch for in the coming months.andM;IBM.andP;  Everyone is waiting to see what IBM will do.andP;  Microsoft conducted mostof its investigation without substantial input from its partner in OS/2Presentation Manager.andP;  Even so, most people have assumed that IBM willvalidate what Microsoft has decided.andM;We do not think that this is a foregone conclusion.andP;  If IBM is serious aboutits commitment to provide transparent data exchange across its entire rangeof products, it is obligated to have a common font strategy across them: notjust PCs, but Unix workstations, minis, mainframes, and the full range ofprinters, from desktop dot-matrix and laser printers to high-volume mainframeoutput devices.andM;Do not forget, moreover, that IBM already has a fair corporate commitment toAdobe PostScript.andP;  It sells PostScript printers and it has licensed NextStepand Display PostScript.andP;  It has important customers who have made majorcommitments to PostScript and to Adobe fonts based partially on IBM'sendorsement.andP;  We doubt that anyone really knows what IBM will decide to do inthe current circumstance.andM;It must do something.andP;  At the Conference, Nick Donofrio waffled artfully.andP;  Hesaid that IBM will include support for Royal technology in its version ofOS/2, but he stopped short of any stronger endorsement.andP;  Given the short timeit had since Microsoft had told it what it intended to do and thefar-reaching implications of the decision, we did not expect anything more.andM;But it must do more in fairly short order.andP;  Bill Gates has clarified theissues for IBM marvelously.andP;  It probably must support both Microsoft andAdobe in some fashion, but it is hard to see how it can avoid committing toone or the other as the preferred IBM solution.andM;Sun, HP and OSF.andP;  Much of the time pressure on IBM is generated by the factthat other important companies have yet to make up their minds.andP;  With theworld narrowing its focus to two principal font technologies, SunMicrosystems will be under increasing pressure to support one of them.andP;  Sunis being courted by both sides because both covet its Folio TypeMakertechnology.andM;TypeMaker is especially important to Apple, which has no automatic means ofgenerating the hints upon which Royal depends.andM;Hewlett-Packard, for its part, is forging ahead with Compugraphic'sIntellifont technology.andP;  In an effort to stay competitive, CG announced atthe Conference that it, too, will make its front format public so that othercompanies can offer Intellifont-format fonts and so that other printercompanies can build printers that can use these fonts.andM;The Open Software Foundation (OSF), the Unix consortium formed by HP, DEC,IBM and others, will also be drawn into the fray.andP;  The OSF Motif graphicenvironment does not currently support scalable outline fonts--a deficiencythat OSF must remedy sooner or later.andM;What choices will these companies make?andP;  If IBM puts its support behindRoyal, HP will come under increasing pressure to migrate to Royal, as willSun.andP;  And if IBM and HP are supporting Royal, we would presume that OSF (andtherefore DEC) will also.andM;However, if IBM tilts in favor of Adobe, there is a good chance that Sun willdo the same--and quite possibly HP and OSF as well.andM;Clones.andP;  All of this is, of course, good news for the PostScript clonevendors.andP;  Richard Patterson of Hyphen commented after the first day of theConference that &quot;You are going to have to remove the grin from my facesurgically.&quot;andM;Clone vendors gain the legal right to use Adobe Type One format fonts.andP;  Theymust still write their own rasterizer software (not a trivial problem, but weare certain that sooner or later companies will offer software that producesbitmap screen and/or printer fonts).andP;  But they now also have the choice ofusing the Apple/Microsoft format, secure in the knowledge that it, too, islikely to become an industry standard.andM;User inputandM;This is also the time when user input will have the most impact.andP;  Microsoftwill want guidance on how it should extend PostScript.andP;  IBM, HP, Sun and DECwill rely on customer feedback to help shape their decisions on whichdirection they should go.andM;One of the first organizations to recognize this opportunity was theNewspaper Systems Group (NSG), a prestigious group of large newspapers andnewspaper chains.andP;  At the NSG meeting held the week following the Conference,the members passed a resolution asking all vendors who serve them to embracethe Adobe position and to reject the Microsoft/Apple font technology and pagedescription language.andM;If you have strong opinions one way or the other, or if you want to help pushMicrosoft's implementation in a particular direction, we suggest that youcontact the company in question as soon as possible and air your opinions.andO;Most of these companies will listen.andM;Other font issues from the TutorialandM;In the afternoon session on the first day, topics related to the morningsession were addressed in a few Tutorials, from which the following noteswere prepared.andM;Revolution's benefits.andP;  Monotype's Renee Kerfante brought an historicalperspective to several font-related issues.andP;  He compared today's situation(with all its unresolved problems) with the reality that faced typographersand publishers ten or fifteen years ago.andP;  In the bad old days, eachtypesetting manufacturer had its own command language and its own fontlibrary.andP;  Only trained experts could operate this equipment.andP;  Fontcompatibility was unheard-of, and even document interchange was difficult anderror-prone.andP;  Essentially, once you had picked your system supplier, you werelocked in for a long time.andP;  In contrast, today PostScript is a standardcommand language for typesetting machines, and we take it for granted thatany computer can be attached to any PostScript printer through a serial portor over a network.andP;  Font foundries compete to provide their fonts incompatible formats, each touting some unique design or technical advantage.andM;As one barometer of the revolution's benefits to users, consider the price ofa single font:andM;* 1960  $4,500 * 1980  $450 * 1989  $45andM;When the present confusion seems overwhelming, it can be useful to stand backand see how much worse it once was.andM;Hints, pro and con.andP;  Following a review of the positioning of the principalfont formats--those championed by Adobe, Apple, HP and Sun--Kerfante turnedto the issue of hints.andP;  There is little question that below 300 dpi, hintsgreatly improve the readability of type.andP;  But at high resolution (or at largesizes on 300-dpi printers), hints may actually reduce type quality bycompromising various aspects of the design.andP;  Subtle curves become straightlines; deliberately unequal elements get equalized; slightly slanted linesbecome perfect verticals.andM;The argument boils down to this: if the target printer is a high-resolutionimagesetter, hints will be unnecessary and possibly detrimental.andP;  (The degreeof detriment is very dependent on the font design.)andP;  Any ugliness thatappears on low-resolution printers is of no consequence, since those printersare only for checking layout and content.andP;  On the other hand, if alow-resolution printer is to be used for final copy, hints are highlydesirable.andP;  Adobe, attempting to satisfy both high- and low-resolutionmarkets, has actually issued two fonts, Optima and Eras, containing bothhinted and unhinted versions of the characters.andP;  But this is a very expensivesolution to the problem.andM;PCL: the real giantandM;Although PostScript has captured the hearts and minds of the graphic artscommunity, the real giant in the market is the PCL language used in millionsof HP LaserJets and compatible printers.andP;  HP's Cathy Lyons talked about whereHP intends to take PCL.andP;  To begin with, HP wants to deliver cost-effectivefunctionality.andP;  To keep costs down, HP has willingly left features out.andO;(Contrast this with Adobe's stated goal in designing PostScript: to be ableto image any page the mind could imagine.)andP;  It has also been concerned topreserve the investments its current customers have made, so any enhancementsto PCL must include all of the current PCL 4 functions.andM;As Lyons described it, PCL 5 will essentially look like a superset of PCL 4with the HP plotter command language, HPGL, grafted on.andP;  In addition, PCL 5controllers will use the Agfa Compugraphic Intellifont technology to renderbitmaps from scalable outline fonts.andP;  More detailed language specificationswill be released at a developers' conference to be held October 15-18.andM;Upscale option.andP;  Agfa has become more than just a font supplier to HP.andP;  Ithas also developed a high-resolution PCL typesetter that was demonstratedfirst at the Conference.andP;  The PCL RIP, which Agfa calls DirectSet, runs as asoftware option in the Compugraphic Genics controller with any 9000-seriesmarking engine, much the way Tegra offers PCL support in its Image Controllerthat drives low- and high-resolution recorders.andP;  (For details on theDirectSet software, see The Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, Vol.andP;  19,No.andP;  1.)andM;The deal confers benefits on both HP and Agfa.andP;  HP can offer itsquality-conscious users a way to produce top-quality pages.andP;  Many an artdirector or production manager has insisted on PostScript over the past yearsbecause one could prepare documents on a LaserWriter, going through all therevision cycles in-house at low cost, then sending the file out for finaltypesetting.andP;  (It's a lot cheaper than marking up typeset galleys any numberof times.)andP;  Now, the same option exists for the LaserJet.andP;  Agfa, for itspart, recalls very well the dominant position Linotype built up in thePostScript market before a flurry of competitors entered the battle.andP;  Ithopes to benefit by getting an early start in the PCL fray, taking advantageof the phenomenal installed base of LaserJets in the broad office market,which it hopes can be stimulated to demand top-quality repro masters now andthen.andP;  Agfa can thereby hope to sell lots of 9400s and 9600s to PCL servicebureaus.andM;Obsolescence-proof.andP;  Another key part of HP's strategy was disclosed in BillGates's speech earlier in the day: Microsoft's OS/2 will support installablescreen font software, which will be part of the printer drive.andP;  Thus an HPLaserJet device driver could be written that would guarantee that screenfonts (derived, in this case, from CG Intellifont outlines) would match thefonts the printer was using.andP;  HP's printers will be protected fromobsolescence, even though OS/2's default screen fonts will be based onApple's Royal scaling technology.andM;Maintaining the gap.andP;  What isn't clear in all this is whether PCL Level 5will be able to preserve its price advantage over PostScript.andP;  Clearly, someadditional silicon (and hence additional cost) will be required to supportthe increased functionality of Level 5.andP;  At the same time, theMicrosoft/Apple/Adobe imbroglio promises to make PostScript--even Adobe'spremium version--more cost-effective in the future.andP;  These two factors willreduce, and possibly eliminate, the price gap between PCL and PostScriptprinters.andM;In spite of its large share of laser printer sales today (HP sells almost 80%of all laser printers), HP probably won't be able to remain a bystander inthe font wars between Apple/Microsoft and Adobe, since the outcome of thatstruggle will largely determine the PDL and font standards for the industryin the future.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
