(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Crews worked under a tight scheduleto ready the shuttle Discovery for an after-dark launch Wednesdaywith a NASA spokesman predicting the crew would have Thanksgivingturkey in space.   Workers made up for time lost on a parts replacement earlier andKennedy Space Center spokesman Dick Young said ``from a technicalstandpoint we look good and from a weather standpoint we lookgood.''   The launch time is a secret and so is the nature of the militarypayload the crew of five is to put into orbit. NASA has said onlythat liftoff is set between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. EST.   There is only a 20 percent chance weather will interfere,forecasters said. If the launch has to be Thursday, the weatheroutlook worsens to 60 percent unfavorable.   The menu released for the mission includes ``thermostabilized''turkey and gravy, which means the food has enough preservatives tobe carried without refrigeration.   ``We are hopeful the crew will have Thanksgiving dinner inspace,'' Young said.   Checking systems and putting the two solid fuel booster rocketsback together had put the schedule in jeopardy. The rockets wereopened last week to inspect computer boxes for faulty wiring andone box was replaced.   The flight, commanded by Air Force Col. Frederick C. Gregory, isthe fifth shuttle flight dedicated solely to the DefenseDepartment. Officials said keeping advance knowledge of theexpected liftoff time secret makes tracking the shuttle moredifficult for Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy shipsitting off Cape Canaveral.   Announcement of an imminent launch will be made nine minutesbefore the event, but there will be no public air-to-ground linkduring the mission.   The cargo is believed to be a satellite capable of monitoringdiplomatic and military communications in the Soviet Union andother countries.   The launch will be only the third after nightfall in 32 shuttlemissions and is, like the others, expected to provide a spectacularsight in this central Florida area. The last night launch, inNovember 1985, was visible along the 700 miles from Key West, Fla.,to Charleston, S.C.   Gregory, and the pilot Air Force Col. John Blaha, practicednight landings on the shuttle runway here in a jet equipped tohandle like a shuttle.   Disovery is scheduled to land at night at Edwards Air ForceBase, Calif., after a flight expected to last four days. Gregoryand Blaha also would have to land the shuttle in the dark here orat emergency runways in Spain or North Africa in case of an abortafter liftoff.   Gregory, who flew on a 1985 shuttle mission, is the first blackshuttle commander. The other crew members are Navy Capt. Manley L.Carter Jr., F. Story Musgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.  </TEXT></DOC>
