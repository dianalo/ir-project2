(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group that defends the legend of Billythe Kid says a computer photo analysis indicates a Texan nicknamed``Brushy Bill'' who died in 1950 probably wasn't the famed outlaw,as he had claimed.   The computer tests compared a photograph of Ollie L. ``BrushyBill'' Roberts, who died in Hico, Texas, a week short of his 90thbirthday in December 1950, and a tintype of William Bonney, whodied at age 21 on July 14, 1881.   Most people, including a coroner's inquest jury at the time, sayBonney was Billy the Kid and he was shot to death in Fort Sumter,N.M., by Lincoln Sheriff Pat Garrett.   But Hico has its share of Brushy Bill believers who maintain theKid escaped, perhaps with official help, to survive to a ripe oldage in Texas.   Billy the Kid was one of the primary players in the bloodyLincoln County War of the late 19th century. Now, the LincolnCounty Heritage Trust is watching out for the Kid's legend, and itinitiated the photo project.   Trust director Robert L. Hart said Friday the computer testswere based on a similarity index of 25 landmarks on the faces.   The computer also matched Billy to a database of 150 people fromboth sexes and many racial groups, Hart said, to show how manypeople in the sample, if any, were closer in appearance to Billythan was Brushy Bill.   From the 25 landmarks of the face the computer mathematicallyderives a single number _ the index of similarity.   If Brushy Bill and Billy the Kid were the same man, Hart said,``then in the comparison, Billy is No. 1 and Brushy should come outNo. 2.''   ``When the comparison was run, Brushy Bill was No. 42.   ``That means there were 40 other individuals who look more likeBilly the Kid than Brushy does. In short, Brushy doesn't look verymuch like Billy the Kid at all,'' Hart said.   Hico Justice of the Peace Bobby Hefner, a Brushy Bill buff, saidFriday the computer study means nothing.   ``I don't accept the tintype as being Billy the Kid at all,''Hefner said in a telephone interview from his Hico home. ``On theother hand, I don't accept the study. You let me program mycomputer, and I guarantee Brushy Bill'd be number one.''   But Clyde Snow, an Oklahoma forensic anthropologist known forhis work on the remains of Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele, saidthe computer looks at photographs in a less subjective way thanpeople do.   ``As far as Brushy Bill Roberts is concerned, the weight of theevidence is to the point that if there were a court case, we'd bewilling to go in and say beyond a reasonable doubt the twophotographs are not photographs of the same individual,'' Snow said.   Hart said the Brushy Bill comparison is the only one that hasbeen done. But the project plans to look at a dozen or so otherphotographs, including pictures of two other claimants, John Millerof Ramah, N.M., and Walking Henry Smith, and photographs believedto be those of Billy taken at other times.   That could take a couple of years.   Hart called the project a ``marriage of history and technology.''   ``Historians don't seem to be able to solve the problem ofwhether Brushy Bill and Billy the Kid are the same person,'' andbringing in science was another way to answer the question, he said.   The photographs, one from a Las Vegas, N.M., collection and theother owned by a San Francisco family, came to light after theproject began last year.   Hefner, 54, agreed research would continue into the legend ofBilly the Kid.   ``The old Texas Rangers had a saying that no one can stand up toa man that's in the right and keeps on a-comin'. And that's myapproach to this,'' Hefner said. ``I'm in the right. I've enoughevidence in hand to convince anyone that doesn't have a prejudice.   ``I never met old Brushy,'' he said. ``Maybe it's my sense offair play, of being justice of the peace: I want justice done for alocal man. I'd like to see it on through to a just conclusion.''</TEXT></DOC>
