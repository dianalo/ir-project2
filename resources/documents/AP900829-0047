There was only ``a remote chance'' the hurricane would veertowards the U.S. East Coast during its trek northward, Fagen said.   At 6 a.m. EDT, Gustav's center was located near 23.6 degreesnorth latitude and 57.6 west longitude, or about 750 milessoutheast of Bermuda. It was moving northward at about 10 mph andwas expected to hold that course and speed for the next 24 hours.   Earlier in the week, Gustav skirted the Leeward Islands in thenortheastern Caribbean, where hurricane warnings posted during theweekend were dropped Monday.   Tropical storm Hortense, about 1,000 miles apart in themid-Atlantic, also posed no threat to land.   At 6 a.m., Hortense was moving northwest near 10 mph and hadwinds of 60 mph. The storm was centered near 24.5 degrees northlatitude and 46.8 degrees west longitude, or about 1,450 mileswest-northwest of the Cape Verde islands.   The storm was expected to lose strength over the next two days,according to the hurricane center.   Hortense, the eighth named storm of the Atlantic season, andGustav were born as tropical depressions near the Cape Verdearchipelago off West Africa.   Tropical depressions become named storms when their sustainedtop winds reach 39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes at 74mph. The Atlantic hurricane season runs through November.</TEXT></DOC>
