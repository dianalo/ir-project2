Feb. 11   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, Ariz., on drug tests:   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is headed in the rightdirection with its move toward a rule requiring random drug andalcohol testing of employees at all U.S. nuclear power plants.   Given the risks and the magnitude of mishaps, it is frighteningto think that workers at such critical jobs would not be closelymonitored, and certainly the monitoring should include regularchecks for evidence of substance abuse.   Implementation of the proposed regulation, which would apply toall utilities operating or building atomic power stations, hinges onfinal approval by the NRC, which is expected to rule in about amonth, and official publication of the rule, which could take anadditional month.   The possibility _ more likely a probability _ also exists of atime-consuming legal challenge. ...   The mere thought of an alcohol-impaired or a drug-high technicianloose in the operational section of a nuclear power plant ischilling. Let the testing begin.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 21   The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on the costs of Congress:   Taxpayers are supporting a congressional bureaucracy inWashington that will cost more than $2.2 billion this year.   Where does all this money go? Much of it supports a bureaucracythat has grown to 37,500 workers, including staff of individualmembers' offices and committees.   As if this year's budget wasn't big enough, the lawmakers wanteven more for fiscal 1990. Congress has proposed an extra $53million for postal expenses, to cover heavy election-year``official'' mailings.   The budget also includes hefty increases for House and Senateemployee salaries and office expenses.   How many taxpayers believe they're getting their money's worth? Arecent poll gave Congress a favorable rating of only 53 percent.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 20   The Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on President Bush and thebudget:   For all of George Bush's conciliatory talk to Congress about thebudget, the problem is still there: We're spending far too muchmoney, or we're taxing too little.   Instead of this ``no new taxes, read my lips'' approach, we wouldprefer for the president to talk straight to the American people,call for sacrifice if that's what's necessary _ more taxes and lessspending to get the red ink under control.   We've had eight years of Ronald Reagan's wishful thinking andCongress' irresponsibility which has gotten the nation into badfinancial trouble.   We hope Bush will be different.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 17   Walla Walla (Wash.) Union-Bulletin on gun lobbyists:   The National Rifle Association had Sen. Howard Metzenbaum in itscrosshairs, and missed. Politicians around the country should takenotice.   The NRA, considered by many to wield the power of an 800-poundgorilla, may be nothing more than a monkey on the back ofpoliticians.   The NRA and other gun lobbyists base their political clout on thesupport from millions of hunters and other gun owners across thenation who fear they will lose their weapons.   Thankfully, the American people would not stand for politicianstaking away hunters' guns or restricting their use.   However, the truth is most Americans, whether gun owners or not,do not object to an appropriate and reasonable form of gun control,specifically legislation aimed at banning semiautomatic assaultweapons. ...   Metzenbaum, now pushing legislation to halt sales of AK47s,Israeli-made Uzis and a host of other military-style weapons, haschallenged the NRA and not been hurt. Despite being an NRA target inlast fall's election, Metzenbaum easily won re-election to hisSenate seat from Ohio.   It's time for other lawmakers to follow Metzenbaum's lead andtoss the NRA monkey off their backs.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 21   Arkansas Democrat, Little Rock, Ark., on Winnie Mandela:   Sometimes, it takes an event of incomprehensible horror to shakepeople to their senses.   By now, most everyone knows that Winnie Mandela _ the prominentSouth African anti-apartheid activist and wife of jailed AfricanNational Congress leader Nelson Mandela _ has been disowned by hercountry's civil rights leaders for her complicity in the murder of achild, 14-year-old James ``Stompie'' Seipei.   The United Democratic Front, South Africa's largestanti-apartheid organization, issued a statement saying itsmembership is ``outraged by her obvious complicity'' in theabduction and slaying of the boy, who was involved in black activistcauses. The child was allegely abducted by members of the MandelaUnited Football Club, the gang of rogues and thugs who act as``bodyguards'' for Mrs. Mandela.   In all, three young activists were allegedly killed by theseoutlaws, and two more have disappeared and may be dead.   While we abhor the horrors of apartheid _ the bulldozing of blacktownships, the racist oppression, and the murders of men like StevenBiko, who was much more moderate than Mandela _ we also abhor thetype of Marxist dictatorship the Mandelas seek to replace with it.   The Winnie Mandelas of South Africa cannot be allowed to prevail.The people of her country, black and white, deserve better.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
