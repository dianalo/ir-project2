Prosecutor Willy Heim said the ``horror of the crime'' barred anyleniency toward the 22-year-old defendant he described as a ``killerblinded by conviction.''   In a brief statement, Hariri, identified in court as a member ofthe pro-Iranian Shiite Hezbollah group, said he regretted the deathof passenger Xavier Beaulieu but that the hijacking was ``not an actof terrorism but was combat.''   Hariri faces charges of murder and hostage-taking in the trial inFederal Criminal Court that began Monday. The five-judge panelhearing the case is scheduled to announce a verdict and sentence onFriday.   Heim's final arguments came after testimony by passengers andcrew members, including by a chief steward the Congolese chiefsteward, Andre Memba, who he said he was an eyewitness of theexecution-style slaying of Beaulieu.   An American on the plane said Tuesday that he began writing hiswill after the Frenchman was killed.   Beaulieu was shot from behind and at close distance after athree-minute deadline set by Hariri for the refueling of the DC-10at Geneva airport.   Hariri told the court earlier he did not intend to kill Beaulieubut that he fired without aiming when the 28-year-old Frenchman,whose head was covered with a blanket made a threatening move. Membasaid Beaulieu was seated when he was shot and that Hariri wasstanding behind him.   ``The witness was bought, the way I bought the customsofficial,'' Hariri protested in French. It was a reference to the $6bribe he paid to slip by controls at Bangui, the capital of CentralAfrica, where he boarded the plane with a 7.65 millimeter pistol,140 rounds of ammunition and 562 grams of TNT.   The French pilot, Edouard Artizzu, testified that a PLOrepresentative, Nabil Ramlawi, who negotiated with Hariri at therequest of Swiss authorities, was to be credited for talking thehijacker out of killing a second passenger.   Hariri earlier said Ramlawai, who heads the Palestine LiberationOrganization's Geneva mission, was a ``traitor'' and blamed him forthe failure of his mission.   The plane, bound for Paris, was diverted over northern Italy July24, 1987 with Hariri demanding the release of Lebanon andPalestinian prisoners held by French, West German and Israeliauthorities. The ordeal ended when crewmembers overpowered Haririwhile Swiss police stormed the plane.   In earlier testimony, the lone American hostage in the drama saidhe wrote his will on a page of a travel journal after he sawBeaulieu's body taken off the plane by two stewards.   ``This was the first point at which I really expected to die(too),'' said Peter W. Schroth, 42. ``I prepared a will which I gaveto the steward.''   Schroth, a lawyer and Hartford, Conn., businessman, was the firstpassenger directly threatened by Hariri while he was collectingpassports to sort out French nationals.   He said Hariri picked him after he was unable to turn over hispassport because it was in his suitcase.   ``He placed his pistol against the back of my head and shouted tothe other passengers, `Look at this man, if anyone moves he willdie.'
