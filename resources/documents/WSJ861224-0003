Federal prosecutors likened the defendant to the character played by the late Zero Mostel in the movie &quot;The Producers,&quot; saying that the man sold to each of 165 investors 1% of the gross income of his company, International Trading andamp; Commodities Ltd., and promised each investor 1% of the company's stock. The government said scores of &quot;unsophisticated&quot; investors in the venture lost between $15,000 and $50,000 each.    The defendant, Leonard Edwin Sturtz, 62 years old, had pleaded guilty Oct. 31 to five counts of securities fraud. According to David Spears, the assistant U.S. attorney who handled the case, Mr. Sturtz received more than $3 million from the 165 investors from 1978 to 1982. The company, which Mr. Sturtz founded in the late 1970s, attracted investors through numerous ads in New York area newspapers, including the New York Times, the government said.    But after the Securities and Exchange Commission began a probe of the firm in late 1981, Mr. Sturtz moved to Morocco, allegedly with all the investors' funds. He was deported after being indicted in May by a federal grand jury in New York, based on a federal regulation that allows the government to revoke the passport of someone indicted for a felony.    Mr. Spears, the prosecutor, said the maneuver to deport Mr. Sturtz was &quot;somewhat novel&quot; and may be used in the future against alleged criminals hiding in countries that don't have extradition agreements with the U.S.    Mr. Sturtz's attorney, William M. Brodsky, said his client was &quot;running a legitimate business&quot; and was seeking extra financing for his enterprise before he was indicted. He said his client's guilty plea referred only to the fact that he neglected to tell investors that he was permanently barred in 1955 from selling securities in New York state. In answer to the &quot;Producers&quot; comparison, Mr. Brodsky asserted that his client never had more than 100 people at one time &quot;actually associated with the enterprise.&quot;    The SEC has a pending default judgment against Mr. Sturtz requiring him to pay back $2 million to the firm's investors. Mr. Sturtz has been held without bail since July and has begun serving his sentence. </TEXT></DOC>
