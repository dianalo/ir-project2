The oil-centered industries that played the leading rolein achieving the rapid economic growth have come to a turning point aftersuffering from two oil crises in the 1970s. Oil accounted for 45 percentof the total primary energy consumed in the free economic world in 1985.The world's total reserve production ratio of coal is still nearly 200years, and other resources such as oil sand and shale also remain inhuge amounts. On the other hand, the reserve production ratio of oiland natural gas is 35 and 57 years, respectively, and some restrictionsare expected to be imposed on their supplies in the 21st century. Thus,it is important to encourage the utilization of natural gas and coalas substitutes for oil and to promote the 'noble use' of oil in the areasof transportation and petrochemical industries, for which effective substituteenergy sources have not been found. To achieve this, efforts should bemade to provide new technologies for cracking of heavy oil, direct conversionfrom natural gas to oil, clean utilization of coal and development offuel cells.
