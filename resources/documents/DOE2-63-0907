These impacts areestimated using a variety of assumptions about market penetration andindustry location, within the larger context of an economy in difficulty.Seven representative heating systems and applications are described indetail, with estimates of the heat supplied as well as the direct laborand material requirements for each system. These estimates are used asinput data to an employment impact simulation model that allows examinationof the employment and energy implications of various assumptions aboutthe future of solar heating in Canada. It distinguishes among rates ofimplementation for each system system in 5 major Canadian regions; outputincludes estmates for each region to the year 2000 of the energy suppliedby solar heating, the cumulative installed collector area, and the amountof direct and indirect labor employed in the solar heating industry.Employment implications of exporting solar collectors, and assumptionsregarding implementation rates, location of the solar industry in Canada,and the reliance on imports, are also examined. Results show that directemployment from now to 2000 could amount to 170,000 man-years, and indirectemployment could be 3 times this figure. The resultant employment wouldbe distributed according to the rate of solar heating implementationin each region. The rate of increase in employment exceeds the rate ofincrease in energy savings. Variations in the rate of implementationmean more for employment than variations in the extent to which Canadarelies on imported collectors. 35 refs, 1 fig., 75 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
