Will RogersIII, but said he isn't responsible for act, the Los Angeles Timesreported today.   ``I didn't do it and I don't know who did it,'' said H. GeorgeMarxmiller a commercial pilot for Eastern Airlines who now lives inLake Oconee, Ga. ``But they suspect I know who did it. (Yet) tothink I would do something like this is utter nonsense. It's so outof character. It doesn't compute.''   The interview was conducted earlier this week in Georgia, thenewspaper said.   As skipper of the USS Vincennes, Rogers gave the July 1988 orderto shoot down what turned out to be an Iranian jetliner. All 290people aboard the plane were killed.   Rogers later was exonerated on grounds he had reason to believehis ship was under attack as it patrolled the Persian Gulf duringthe Iran-Iraq War.   Investigators originally believed the March 10 bombing ofRogers' van in San Diego was done by terrorists in retaliation forthe attack.   Roger's wife, Sharon, narrowly escaped injury when the pipeplanted in the van exploded at a busy intersection.   Federal investigators changed their thinking on the case whenMarxmiller's name emerged, the Times said.   It reported that multiple sources had confirmed that Marxmilleris now the leading individual under investigation in the case.   The special agent in charge of the FBI in San Diego has refusedto comment on the investigation.   Marxmiller and Rogers said they had met only once, several yearsago, and that they had not seen each other since.   ``I dimly remember the guy,'' Rogers said. ``I have no idea whyhe would be involved in this thing. And I have no other comment.''   Marxmiller adamantly denied having a personal vendetta againstRogers or a desire to hurt him or his family. ``I don't haveanything against the guy,'' he said.   Marxmiller said he had taken two polygraph tests since thesummer and was asked whether he was involved in the bombing.   Marxmiller said he believed he failed a question in the secondtest about whether he had planned the bombing or knew who placedthe bomb under the van.   He said the FBI also has asked for his fingerprints and aphotograph and has interviewed his brother extensively about theirwhereabouts around the time of the bombing.   FBI officials also seemed interested in the fact that Rogers'name is among three dozen people listed as witnesses on behalf ofMarxmiller's wife, Rebecca, who is suing for divorce in Georgia,according to the newspaper.   Neither H. George Marxmiller nor Rogers could explain whyRogers' name was listed as a witness.</TEXT></DOC>
