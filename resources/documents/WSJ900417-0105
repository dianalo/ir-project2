In a strongly worded official statement, Hisham Nazer, theSaudi oil minister, called OPEC's need to discipline outputthrough &quot;adherence to production ceiling and quotas. . . anextremely crucial matter.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Nazer said the current situation, in which oil priceshave fallen by $2 to $3 a barrel from the start of the month,not only hurts producers but also weakens chances of a pricerecovery in the year's second half. He said Saudi Arabia'sgovernment &quot;is making necessary contacts with other membersof OPEC to bring production back to the determined ceiling&quot;of 22 million barrels a day.   The kingdom announced separately that Mr. Nazer will meettoday in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with the oil ministers ofKuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Kuwait and the UAE areblamed for much of the two million barrels a day inoverproduction that has pushed OPEC output to an eight-yearhigh of 24 million barrels a day.   It was known that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oilexporter, has been worried by the April price slide. But, incontrast to other times when over-quota output eroded prices,the kingdom had remained uncharacteristically quiet untilyesterday.   Whether the Saudi moves will curb OPEC's overproduction ornot, they already have had an impact on world oil markets.Many markets were closed yesterday in an extended Easterweekend. But prices rose, if only temporarily, in U.S.futures and spot markets after the Saudi announcements.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West TexasIntermediate crude for May delivery briefly broke above thepsychologically-important level of $18 a barrel. It then fellback to settle at $17.85 a barrel, still up seven cents forthe day. June WTI rose 16 cents to $18.67 a barrel on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange, and other petroleum futures werehigher for the day.   Not everyone gave the Saudis credit for the rally. &quot;Thiswas purely a technical bounce; the market clearly wasoversold,&quot; said Shahrokh Nikkhah, senior vice president,futures investments, at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Still, the Saudi announcements contributed further to atheory held by a number of industry officials that$15-a-barrel oil is the trigger for OPEC action when oilprices are falling. Once certain prices threaten to dropthrough that level, leading producers begin taking steps tostop the slide, the theory holds.   A premium crude such as West Texas Intermediate still iswell above $15. But the average of the OPEC basket of sevencrudes fell to around $15.30 late last week. This is thebasket that OPEC uses to measure against its targeted minimumreference price of $18 a barrel. Significantly, too, spotprices of Dubai, an important Middle East crude produced inthe United Arab Emirates, have neared $14 a barrel in recentdays.   More people than the Saudi oil minister are alarmed by thedeclines, of course. Several other ministers -- includingSadek Boussena of Algeria, acting president of OPEC -- havesuggested that an emergency ministerial meeting might benecessary if prices continued to fall.   But such a special meeting is doubtful because theministers already are scheduled to hold their regular midyearconference May 25. It's understood Middle East producersdon't want to see a special meeting of all the ministers heldbefore then.   Meantime, most of the oil ministers are stepping up theircontacts with each other, in informal face-to-face meetingssuch as the one that will take place in Saudi Arabia today,and over the telephone. The &quot;telephone dialogues&quot; are neededto reverse &quot;the present downward trend of prices in the worldmarket,&quot; said Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oilminister.</TEXT></DOC>
