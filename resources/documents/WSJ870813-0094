Simon andamp; Schuster, a Gulf andamp; Western Inc. unit, filed suit in federal district court here last week against members of New York's Crime Victims Board, challenging the constitutionality of the New York law. The law was enacted in 1977 after convicted murderer David Berkowitz -- known as the Son of Sam -- contracted for a book about his life.    The Crime Victims Board, a state agency that administers the law, said the state attorney general is preparing its answer to the complaint.    Under the New York law, publishers that contract with any person accused or convicted of a crime must pay any money owed to that person over to the Crime Victims Board. The funds are held in an escrow account; victims seeking restitution must establish civil liability on the part of the convict and obtain a judgment in a separate judicial process. If no victims step up or are successful in their civil cases, the funds may go back to the perpetrator after five years.    The Simon andamp; Schuster suit was filed in response to the board's recent determination that the statute applies to &quot;Wiseguy,&quot; a Simon andamp; Schuster book written by journalist Nicholas Pileggi.    &quot;Wiseguy&quot; details the life of Henry Hill, described by the publisher as &quot;a career criminal involved in organized crime since he was a youth.&quot; Mr. Hill had been given a new identity under the Federal Witness Protection program and agreed to cooperate only if he was paid for his story.    In June, the Crime Victims Board said Simon andamp; Schuster had violated the statute by paying $96,250 to literary agent Sterling Lord for Mr. Hill. It ordered the publisher to turn over that amount and told Mr. Lord's agency to pay the board all the money it received or will receive on Mr. Hill's account, as well as its fee for being Mr. Hill's representative. Simon andamp; Schuster asked the court for an injunction preventing the board from enforcing the statute and an order declaring the statute unconstitutional.    A number of other publishers said they support the suit, as did several groups involved in freedom of speech issues. &quot;This is an issue of great importance to all publishers, and the thought that a book as insightful as 'Wiseguy' might not have been published is appalling,&quot; said Erwin Gilkes, chairman of the Freedom to Read committee of the Association of American Publishers.    The &quot;Son of Sam&quot; law has been the subject of constant controversy since its enactment. Publishers have argued that the law, which spawned a federal statute and similar laws in about 30 other states, violates First Amendment rights. Moreover, they say, the laws discourage insightful books about crime by those closest to it -- the perpetrators. A number of publishers have raised court challenges to the law on individual books, but none previously have attempted to overturn it.    Members of the Crime Victims Board defend the statute and argue that it is constitutional. &quot;No one is preventing any author from writing a book or taking away freedom of speech,&quot; said New York Crime Victims Board Commissioner Angelis Petromelis. &quot;But there is nothing in the Constitution that says you have the right to profit from your crimes. How would everyone feel if David Berkowitz became a millionaire sitting in Attica (prison)?&quot;    Some publishers said the issue is a difficult one. &quot;The public would be against revoking (the statute),&quot; said a spokesman for Bantam Books, a unit of Bertelsmann AG. &quot;They don't want anyone profiting off of criminal activities.&quot;    Simon andamp; Schuster maintains enforcement of the law interferes with the publication of biographies, autobiographies and other nonfiction works on some of the most pressing issues of the day. Moreover, said a Simon andamp; Schuster attorney, &quot;it isn't as if they had a statute that applied to all of a criminal's assets -- this is narrowly tailored to apply only to expression.&quot;    One publisher that successfully challenged the statute recently is Hearst Corp.'s Arbor House unit, which published Sidney Biddle Barrows's &quot;Mayflower Madam.&quot; The book recalled her exploits running a high-class call-girl service. Hearst and Ms. Barrows successfully argued that prostitution is a victimless crime and thus not covered by the statute. Mr. Petromelis, the Crime Victims Board commissioner, still maintains that judgment was flawed. &quot;How does anybody know there are no victims?&quot; he said. &quot;What if some (customer) contracts some disease and sues?&quot;    Publishers in a number of other cases also are fighting Crime Victims Board actions. St. Martins Press, which published a book by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans -- &quot;Trading Secrets: Seduction and Scandal at The Wall Street Journal&quot; -- has asked a federal court to determine whether the Crime Victims Board or Mr. Winans, who is appealing his conviction for securities fraud, should get the proceeds from that book. And the board is holding hearings on whether Jean Harris, the convicted killer of Herman Tarnower, should turn over her payments for &quot;Stranger in Two Worlds,&quot; which was published by Macmillan Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
