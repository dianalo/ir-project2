(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Kansas Sen. Bob Dole scored a solidvictory in South Dakota's Republican presidential primary Tuesday,far outpacing Vice President George Bush, who had written off thestate. And Rep. Richard Gephardt came out on top on the Democraticside after a campaign blitz.   ``I took South Dakota very seriously,'' Dole said. ``Let themessage go out, that it pays to come to South Dakota.''   Bush had sidestepped the Midwest contests and headed directlySouth after his New Hampshire primary victory.   Gephardt's win over Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis deliveredno nominating delegates, but gave Gephardt a victory to point to asthe candidates campaign in the Super Tuesday states. Dukakis,however, scored a win of his own Tuesday night, in Minnesota'scaucuses.   Dukakis was the resounding victor in the New Hampshire primary aweek ago; Gephardt won the Iowa caucuses eight days before that.   The South Dakota primary was moved from its traditional Junedate to the front of the nominating calendar this year.   Gephardt, Dukakis and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon campaignedheavily here. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, Gary Hart andJesse Jackson also vied for support.   Republican voters were choosing all 18 delegates the state willsend to their national convention next summer, while 15 of the 19Democratic delegates were to be allocated on the basis of theprimary.   The Democratic primary is legally non-binding because it fallsprior to the date allowed by Democratic National Party rules. Butstate party officials have said they expect the March 12 statewidecaucus to apportion those 15 delegates according to the results ofTuesday's primary.   The South Dakota Legislature moved the presidential primary fromJune to February in an attempt to draw candidates to a state thatwas largely ignored by presidential contenders in past elections.Backers of the move said it would force the candidates to payattention to South Dakota and the problems of rural America.   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Gephardt had 44percent; Dukakis, 31 percent; Gore, 8 percent; Simon, 6 percent;Hart and Jackson, 5 percent.   For the Republicans, with 99 percent of precincts reporting,Dole had 55 percent; Robertson 20 percent; Bush 19 percent and Kemp5 percent. Former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, who dropped out lastweek, drew 1 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
