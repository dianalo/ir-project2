A self-described country lawyer, 50 years ago, Peckham, orJ.B., as he was known, owned more property than just about anybody in SantaClara County.;   At least on paper.;   He held title to dozens of homes in SanJose, as well as vegetable farms, fruit orchards, flower nurseries and ranchessouth of the city and in the Almaden Valley and along the flanks of MountUmunhum and the east foothills.;   &quot;He owned it for others,&quot; said Rep. NormanMineta, a former mayor of San Jose. &quot;This was a way around the U.S. Alien Actthat prohibited Japanese from owning property. He would put the land in hisname. When the oldest turned 21 and became a U.S. citizen, he would go aheadand transfer title.&quot;;    IT WASN'T that J.B. Peckham had a monopoly on thispractice. But what set him apart was honesty.;   That was put to the testafter the Pearl Harbor attack, when around 5,000 Santa Clara County residentsof Japanese ancestry suddenly had to give up what they had -- storing theirpersonal property -- and turn their land over to renters, many of whom refusedto pay rents, or to title holders who sold the property entrusted to them asif it were their own.;   &quot;J.B. was willing to stick his neck out when doinganything but taking advantage of the Japanese made you unpopular,&quot; remembersMineta, who had turned 10 just before the Pearl Harbor attack.;   His father,Kunisaku, a local insurance agent, had come to San Jose from Japan in 1904. Hebuilt a house on North Fifth Street about a block south of what is nowJapantown. But federal law prohibited him from owning property.;   In May1942, the Mineta family was sent first to an assembly center at the SantaAnita racetrack near Los Angeles, where each family was allocated a stall.Four months later, they were transferred by train to the Heart Mountainrelocation camp in Wyoming.;   J.B. Peckham rented their house to LucieLawson, then a professor of speech at San Jose State University. He collectedthe rent and held it in trust, just as he did for hundreds of other localinternees, and charged only a modest legal fee.;    'WHAT'S FUNNY is that wewere never aware of this,&quot; said Peckham's son, Donald, who is now 81 and grewup in a modest wood-frame house on North 15th Street, exactly 10 blocks eastof Mineta's former house as the crow flies. &quot;He would never discuss business.But he always said he loved the law. He wasn't in it to make money.&quot;;   &quot;Whenwe got word in 1945 that we would be allowed to return home, my dad wrote Mr.Peckham and told him,&quot; Mineta recalls. &quot;When we returned, everything was thesame.&quot;;   It may seem like a small deed because J.B. Peckham did it with suchlittle fanfare. But he did it for hundreds of other Japanese-Americans whospeak his name still with reverence.;   They endured one of the most horriblemistakes in U.S. history, and then got on with their lives because one manstuck his neck out and stayed honest. And their legacy is as far-reaching andprofound in this community as the Peckham name is still prominent.;   Aroundhere, at least, that makes for a flicker of light in an otherwise dark memory.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Pat Dillon column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911124  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  656  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, November 24, 199100329194,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
