(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic presidential contender JesseJackson told Indian leaders today that Indians have been ignored bythe government and ``it's not too much to ask for a summit with theAmerican Indian leadership.''   Jackson spoke to the Indian group at the All Indian PuebloCouncil today, one day after telling a separate audience that theAmerican public deserves a full-scale congressional investigationof U.S. dealings with Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega.   The U.S. government should ``not negotiate with drug dealers,''Jackson said Thursday.   Vice President George Bush and President Reagan have been pleabargaining with Noriega, Jackson said.   ``We need and deserve a full-scale congressionalinvestigation,'' he said. ``So far, we've heard one side of thestory ... they've been trying to smoke him out, buy him out, thedeal being (Noriega's) silence.''   He told the Indians today that they should not surrender theirvalues.   Jackson hearkened back to the beginning of his Rainbow Coalitionand called for people to work together.   ``Hispanics in the barrios, blacks in the ghettos, ranchers onranches, Indians on reservations. ... There's a tendency of thesepeople to be abandoned by law,'' he said. ``The real challenge isto begin to pull together our various backgrounds and find commonground ... to turn to each other and not on each other.''   On Thursday, Jackson spoke to the National Federation ofDemocratic Women as the group opened its annual convention here,and he lamented what he said were inequities women face in society.   ``Half our nation is female. Half of our poor children live in ahouse run by poor women where there is no man,'' he said. ``Womenmake 65 cents on a dollar to what a man makes. ...   ``Your self-respect is not negotiable,'' he said. ``You'veearned the right to expect ERA (the Equal Rights Amendment) to bein the (Democratic Party) platform.''   Dukakis was to speak to the women's group later today.   Jackson also talked of the government's need to stop the flow ofdrugs into the United States.   ``Drugs affect our family. Drugs affect our children in schools.Drugs affect the safety of our streets,'' he said. ``Drugs are theNo. 1 threat to our national security.''   Jackson, in the final weeks of campaigning for his party'snomination, made several campaign appearances in California earlierin the day.   The obviously tired and hoarse candidate also criticized a smallmovement in the United States that wants to make English theofficial language of the country in a reference to the upcomingsummit between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``Reagan is going to meet with Gorbachev this week in Moscow,''he said. ``It's the right thing to do. It's a step in the rightdirection. ... I hope our translator does not speak English only.''   Jackson's visit to New Mexico was the second this month.   Polls indicate Jackson is running far behind Massachusetts Gov.Michael Dukakis for the June 7 primary.   Dukakis has 1,700 delegates for the nomination, while Jacksonhas 983 according to the Associated Press. Another 443 delegatesstill are uncommitted, and a candidate needs at least 2,081 to winthe nomination.   New Mexico will have 28 delegates to the Democratic NationalConvention in Atlanta this summer.</TEXT></DOC>
