As scientific and media examination of this issue hasevolved, there has been little discussion of the broaderclimatic perspective provided by geologic history.Significant natural climatic changes have occurred during theearth's very long existence and to restrict the discussion ofearth-warming to the past 100 or so years ignores a vast bodyof information.</LP><TEXT>   There is overwhelming evidence that we live in aclimatologically unique period, the tail-end of an ice agethat saw continental glaciers a mile or more thick coverlarge portions of the northern hemisphere. In fact, there wasso much oceanic water accumulated in these ice masses thatsea level dropped approximately 350 feet from its currentlevel.   Since a &quot;natural&quot; warming trend began some 15,000-plusyears ago these ice sheets have retreated and the sea levelhas been rising. If this trend continues, as geologic historysuggests it will, the earth will be warmer and more tropicalas it has been for much of its past 600-million-year history,with a brief ice age every now and then to break up themonotony.   The debate about whether or not the combustion of fossilfuels will speed this process by a few tens of years seemsfoolish. The current warming trend commenced long beforehumans had initiated any significant surface or atmosphericactivities. Even a complete ban of CO2 from fossil fuelswould not reverse this trend.
