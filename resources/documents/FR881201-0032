The revised schedule replaces the current schedule for assessmentsdue by January 31, 1989, and beyond. Assessments are increased by 14 percent.This revision is necessary due to a predicted revenue shortfall which resultsfrom decreased revenue growth and increased supervisory responsibilitiesbrought on by the increasing complexity of the financial services industryand the deteriorated condition of many national banks. This action willpermit the OCC to continue to fulfill its statutory responsibilities. Forlong-term planning purposes, the OCC has established a task force to studythe agency's revenue policy and structure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE</T2>: January 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</T2>: Roy C. Madsen, Associate Director,Financial Management Division, (202) 447-0956 or Ferne Fisherman Rubin,Attorney, Legal Advisory Services Division, (202) 447-1880, Office of theComptroller of the Currency, 490 L'Enfant Plaza East SW., Washington, DC20219.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2>:<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The OCC was created by Federal legislation for the purpose of regulatingand supervising the national banking system. Under the National Bank Act,12 U.S.C. 1 <T3>et seq</T3>., the OCC has a responsibility to supervise national banksand to ensure that they comply with applicable law. Pursuant to 12 U.S.C.482, the OCC recovers its expenses by assessing national banks ``in proportionto their assets or resources.'' The statute also requires that the rateof assessment be the same for all banks of the same asset size. The currentassessment schedule, found at 12 CFR Part 8, fulfills this statutory requirement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposal</ITAG>On August 19, 1988, the OCC published a notice of proposed rulemaking (DocketNo. 88-13) in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 31705), concerning the assessment schedule.In that notice, the OCC proposed to increase the assessments due by January31, 1989 and beyond by 14 percent. The OCC estimates this will increaseits assessment revenue in 1989 by approximately $28 million. In futureyears, the amount of increased revenue will vary, based on the growth inbanking assets, ths size distribution of banks, and the rate of inflation.A copy of the proposal was sent as Banking Bulletin 88-25 dated August24, 1988, to the chief executive officer of each national bank. The purposeof the Banking Bulletin was to ensure that each national bank receiveddirect and timely notice of the proposed assessment increase and to explainthe reasons in detail.On September 6, 1988 (53 FR 34307), the OCC published a technical correctionto the notice of proposed rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The correction restored a line to a table showingthe proposed assessment schedule. The line was inadvertently deleted dueto a printing error. None of the proposed rates were changed by the technicalcorrection.On September 20, 1988 (53 FR 36556), the OCC extended the comment periodto October 3, 1988 to address a request by an association representingapproximately 2,000 national banks. The purpose of the extended commentperiod was to allow additional time for all interested parties to assessthe proposal further and to file comments. With this action, we are finalizingthe proposal to increase the assessment rates by 14 percent.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reason for the Action</ITAG>As a result of stringent cost reduction efforts, the OCC expects expensesto match its revenues in 1988. However, unless the present assessment scheduleis revised, a deficit will occur in 1989, and deficits will increase infuture years. The increasing resource demands of the OCC's bank supervisoryresponsibilities have outpaced the OCC's ability to fund those demands.The 14 percent assessment increase is the amount necessary to fund theprojected deficit and provide funds for the resource demands of the supervisoryenvironment. This final rule only addresses anticipated shortfalls broughton by increased OCC supervisory responsibilities, changes in the industryand increased costs since 1984, the year of the last assessment increase.<ITAG tagnum="84">Supervisory Environment Demands Additional Resources</ITAG>The OCC serves the national interest by maintaining and promoting a systemof bank supervision and regulation that promotes safety and soundness byrequiring that national banks adhere to sound management principles andcomply with the law. The financial services environment demands adequateresources for the OCC to maintain prudent levels of supervision. Examiner-relatedexpenses account for approximately 80 percent of the OCC's increased costssince 1983. The OCC has hired additional examiners, provided needed trainingfor experienced examiners, and enhanced its technological capabilities.This enhanced examiner force is needed to address the OCC's responsibilities,as particularly affected by the following external factors:(a) The condition of many national banks has deteriorated. In 1987, bankprofitability stabilized after falling in each of the preceding six years.Bank failures and the number of problem banks continue at high levels.Currently, 17 percent of the national banking system's assets and 22 percentof national banks are receiving special supervisory attention. Weaknessesin the energy and certain real estate sectors of the economy, as well ascontinued difficulties with foreign debt exposure, indicate continued difficultiesfor national banks.(b) Since 1984, new OCC supervisory responsibilities have been mandatedby the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-86, 101 Stat.552), the Government Securities Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-571, 100 Stat.3208), the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (Subtitle H of the Anti-DrugAbuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-570, 100 Stat. 3207), and the Bank BriberyAmendments Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-370, 100 Stat. 779).(c) The deregulation of depository institutions and the entry of banksinto new financial activities have created a more complex banking environmentrequiring new skills on the part of the OCC's staff and increased OCC technologicalcapabilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Decreased Asset Growth</ITAG>The OCC's assessment income is a function of three factors: (1) The levelof nominal national bank assets, (2) the distribution of these assets overdifferent size categories of national banks, and (3) the measured rateof inflation that is used to index the assessment schedule. Primary amongthese factors is the rate of growth of bank assets. If there is no growthin assets, then assessment income will not increase beyond the small amountattributable to the indexation for inflation.As a result of economic trends and conditions in the financial servicesindustry, the current and projected growth rates in national bank assetshave fallen dramatically. In the early 1980s, national bank assets grewat an annual rate of 7.0 percent or higher. In 1986, the growth rate fellto 6.6 percent and to less than 2.0 percent in 1987, the lowest rate since1948. The OCC's assessment income in 1988 grew by only 1.8 percent.<ITAG tagnum="84">Legal Criteria</ITAG>Under 12 U.S.C. 482, assessments must be in proportion to the assets orresources of the bank. The annual rate must be the same for all banks ofthe same size; however, banks examined more than twice in a single calendaryear must pay for any additional examinations.The basic characteristics (<T3>i.e.</T3>, use of asset brackets with declining marginal rates) ofthe OCC assessment schedule were instituted in 1976, continued in 1984,and are used again today. This final rule does not alter those characteristics,which were approved by the United States Court of Appeals for the EighthCircuit in <T3>First National Bank of Milaca v. Heimann</T3>, 572 F.2d 1244 (8th Cir.1978) (``<T3>Milaca</T3>''). The court held that the OCC's 1976 revision compliedwith the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 482.Various legal criteria imposed by 12 U.S.C. 482 and the <T3>Milaca</T3> decision limit the OCC's options with regard to the rangeof available assessment procedures. For example, 12 U.S.C. 482 providesfor the assessment of an additional fee only if a bank is examined morethan twice in a calendar year. The statute therefore prohibits the assessmentof an additional fee for the second examination in a year, as one commentersuggested.Another example of the statutory constraints imposed upon the OCC is thatthe current statute does not appear to allow the OCC to exempt rural banks,banks that suffer from increased competition, or banks in any other specializedcategory from the assessment increase, unless the exemption is relatedto assets or resources. No information that would permit the OCC to exemptbanks in special categories has been received or identified. However, thisand other suggestions from commenters will be referred to the OCC ComprehensiveRevenue Study Task Force for further consideration. That Task Force isdescribed later in this preamble.Some commenters suggested that assessments be based upon the actual numberof hours or resources expended in supervising an institution The currentstatute does not appear to allow the OCC to implement that suggestion unlessit can be directly related to bank assets or resources. Nevertheless, thissuggestion, as with other suggestions, will be referred to the OCC ComprehensiveRevenue Study Task Force for further consideration.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Received</ITAG>The OCC received 225 comments in response to the proposal. The commenterswere national banks, their directors, officers, and employees, trade organizationsand a United States Senator. Most commenters opposed the proposed assessmentincrease. The commenters' concerns fell into four categories of issues,and, in some instances, the commenters suggested alternative methods toresolve those issues. Commenters asserted: That healthy banks should notsubsidize problem banks; that their banks were not examined during theyear but their assessments had increased; that the assessment scheduleis discriminatory or burdensome to small banks; and that the OCC shouldreduce its expenses.<ITAG tagnum="84">Issues Raised</ITAG>Healthy Banks Should Not Subsidize Problem BanksApproximately 10 percent of the commenters suggested that the current assessmentmethodology requires well-run banks to pay some of the costs of specialsupervisory attention given to problem banks. The commenters strongly urgedthat troubled banks be assessed higher fees, due to the greater level ofOCC resources devoted to supervising these banks.Well-run banks subsidize problem banks. However, it is not clear that 12U.S.C. 482 allows the OCC to charge higher assessments to those banks thatreceive disproportionate attention from the OCC, unless a relationshipbetween those banks and bank assets or resources can be shown. The OCChas received no strong evidence thus far that would clearly establish thisrelationship. However, this suggestion, as with other commenter suggestions,will be referred to the OCC Comprehensive Revenue Study Task Force forfurther consideration.Banks Not Examined But Assessments IncreasedSeveral commenters expressed concern that their banks receive fewer on-siteexaminations than in the past, but their assessments have increased.The OCC is aware of this perceived inequity. The OCC's mission is to promotesafety and soundness by requiring that national banks adhere to sound managementprinciples and comply with the law. Fulfillment of this mission requiresthe proper allocation of the OCC's limited supervisory resources. One OCCinitiative in this regard has been the increased use of off-site monitoringand concentration of resources on those institutions that present the greatestrisk to the system.The OCC believes it has developed a better approach to bank supervisionthan the previous practice of examining all banks on a fixed schedule.Under the OCC's present procedures, the frequency and depth of on-sitebank supervision is a direct function of the risk that any given institutionpresents to the safety and soundness of the entire system. Examiners nowperform increased off-site monitoring, and both routine and special on-sitesupervision are scheduled to utilize the OCC's resources more efficiently.As a result, well-run community banks receive less on-site supervision.However, in a departure from past practice, all banks receive continuousoff-site monitoring through an off-site ``portfolio approach'' to banksupervision. Under this supervisory method, each bank is assigned to atleast one national bank examiner who monitors the bank and its environmenton a continuous off-site basis. Therefore, the amount of on-site supervisionby itself is not an accurate indicator of the amount of supervision thebank receives.Assessment Schedule Is Discriminatory to Small BanksMost commenters felt that small banks pay a disproportionate share of OCCassessments relative to their actual cost of supervision.The OCC employs a system of cost accounting that attributes direct supervisioncosts to banks based on the hours spent on each bank by OCC staff. Indirectcosts are allocated to the banks in the same proportions as the directcosts. The OCC, by using that system, has analyzed the relative cost coverageof national banks by asset size. The analysis indicates that banks in thefour asset brackets under $185 million, on average, pay 51 percent of theircost of supervision. Banks in the six asset brackets over $185 million,on average, pay 164 percent of their cost of supervision.While there is variation within each category, the averages clearly indicatethat small banks, as a group, are not discriminated against; rather, thecost of their supervision is subsidized by larger banks. This subsidy wasrecognized by the Eighth Circuit in <T3>Milaca. </T3>572 F.2d at 1248. The final rule maintains the current distribution of assessment burden,which is favorable to small banks, since the 14 percent increase in marginalrates results in the same proportional increase for all banks. Some commenters suggested that a progressive fee or flat fee schedule beadopted in lieu of the regressive schedule now in use and approved by the<T3>Milaca </T3>court. Other commenters suggested that assessment feesshould more accurately reflect the actual cost of supervising large andmerged banks. Both of these suggestions seem to be based upon the commenters'belief that small banks subsidize larger institutions. Relative cost coveragedata does not support that belief.A flat fee schedule and a progressive schedule would increase the largebanks' current subsidy of small banks. Alternatively, if the assessmentschedule more accurately reflected the supervision costs attributable tolarge and merged banks, the subsidy would be reduced and the assessmentslevied upon small banks would rise dramatically.Finally, some commenters suggested including off-balance-sheet activitiesin the assessment calculation. The OCC does incur expenses attendant tothe supervision of off-balance-sheet activities. However, these activitiesare usually conducted by large banks, which already subsidize small banks.Effective assessment of off-balance-sheet activities requires further study.This suggestion, as well as various other suggestions, will be referredto the OCC Comprehensive Revenue Study Task Force for further consideration.OCC Should Reduce Expenses Most commenters questioned whether the OCC has been sufficiently diligentin controlling or cutting costs. As explained earlier in this preamble,throughout the 1980s the OCC has faced continued, increased resource demandsin most areas, including operating expenses, additional staff and training.The OCC has cut costs, but increased resource demands have exceeded theOCC's cost cutting efforts. In the early 1980s, the OCC adopted a new supervisory strategy that improvedits ability to achieve its mission, and that utilized its resources moreeffectively. This strategy involves off-site monitoring of bank performanceon a continuous basis, and focuses supervision on the components of thesystem that present the greatest risk. Indicators of the OCC's cost reductions that result from the implementationof the supervisory approach are: (a) Increased efficiency: Under the prior supervisory scheme, the OCC wouldhave needed a staff of more than 4,000. With the new supervisory approach,the OCC's staff level has been held to 3,250. (b) Lower travel costs: The off-site procedures have resulted in a reductionin average examiner travel cost. More importantly, reduced examiner traveltime substitute productive off-site supervisory hours for unproductivetravel time. Another example of cost control is demonstrated by the way the OCC providescomputer capability to its work force. Prior to 1986, computer serviceswere provided through a service bureau. Under the supervisory approach,examiners use automated services to facilitate analysis. Continued useof the service bureau would have been very costly. To contain costs, theOCC developed its own data center in 1986. The OCC will save $5.6 millionover the first five years of the center's operation. More importantly,the OCC can meet additional data processing demands without significantincreases in costs.The cost containment efforts have been obscured by the increased demandsof the OCC's workload and the complexity of that workload. Without theOCC's efforts to contain costs, an even higher assessment increase wouldbe required. In 1982, the OCC's real (inflation adjusted) cost to supervise$1 billion of bank assets was $105,000. In 1987, that cost was $97,000.This cost decrease was achieved despite the increase in the OCC's workloadover the same period. If the cost decrease had not been achieved, an assessmentincrease of 22 percent or $16 million would be needed as opposed to the14 percent being implemented.The increased resource demands preclude limiting the assessment increaseto the increase in inflation as suggested by several commenters. The increasedresource demands greatly exceed inflation. The OCC has cut its expenses,but cannot cut costs to the point where necessary and prudent operationsare affected. That action would be inconsistent with the OCC's missionto promote safety and soundness by requiring that national banks adhereto sound management principles and comply with the law.<ITAG tagnum="84"> OCC Comprehensive Revenue Study</ITAG>Innovation and change in the financial services industry require that theOCC maintain flexible managerial, technological and supervisory postures.As a result, the current assessment practices may need to be revised. Therefore,the OCC believes that a study of its revenue generation methodolgoy isrequired. The underlying statutory and regulatory basis of the methodologywill be reviewed to determine its adequacy to cover long-term needs andto allocate appropriately the costs of supervision.Consequently, the OCC has convened a Comprehensive Revenue Study Task Forcecharged with reviewing its revenue policy and structure. The OCC must ensurethat any new revenue policy and structure enable it, over time, to accomplishits mission. A comprehensive review of all current and potential revenuesources will be conducted. The Task Force will make recommendations regardinga revenue-generation methodology that accommodates needed supervisory changesin response to legislative, regulatory and economic trends. These recommendationsmay require statutory and regulatory changes. The OCC will inform nationalbanks of the developments of that study.<ITAG tagnum="84"> OCC Action</ITAG>Prompt action is needed to prevent a revenue shortfall in 1989 and beyond.To meet its revenue requirements, the OCC is issuing this final rule torevise the Part 8 assessment schedule to reflect a 14 percent increasecommencing with the assessment due on January 31, 1989. In keeping withthe present schedule, the revised assessment schedule maintains marginalassessment rates that decline as bank assets increase and asset bracketsthat are indexed annually to changes in the Gross National Product ImplicitPrice Deflator.The assessment increase is necessary to avoid deficits, which may impedethe OCC's ability to fulfill its statutory, regulatory and supervisoryresponsibilities. The assessment increase is the minimum amount necessaryto support the OCC's increasing and evolving supervisory responsibilities.The effect of the 14 percent assessment increase on the earnings of nationalbanks will be extremely small. For all national banks, the median returnon assets (``ROA'') currently is .7834 percent. Because of this increase,this median return would fall by 2.4 tenths of a basis point to .7810 percent.The impact on small national banks is also low. For banks in the $15-$85million category, the median ROA will change from .7476 percent to .7449percent. The revision is consistent with the requirements of 12 U.S.C.482, because the new assessment schedule treats banks of similar assetsize in the same manner, and is necessary for the OCC to recover its costs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>It is certified that this final rule does not meet any of the conditionsset forth in Executive Order 12291 for designation as a major rule. Consequently,a regulatory impact statement was not prepared.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.605(b), it is certified that this final rule will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 8</ITAG>National banks, Banking, Assessments, Fees.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority and Issuance</ITAG>For the reasons set forth above, Chapter I of Part 8 of Title 12 of theCode of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 8_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
