When the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meets inLondon this week, talk of extensive change in the alliancewill be in the air, and President Bush will be cheerleadingfor change. But behind the scenes, Mr. Bush is determined tokeep the process from turning into a reckless rush.</LP><TEXT>   West Germany has floated a host of ideas to alter thebasic tenets of the alliance that has existed for more thanfour decades. When NATO leaders meet in London, everythingwill be open to change: defense strategy on the ground, thepositioning of nuclear weapons and the makeup of Westernmilitary forces.   In addition, the U.S. is prepared to discuss with itsallies eventually withdrawing U.S. nuclear-tipped artilleryshells from West Germany unilaterally, the Washington Postreported Sunday. Such a withdrawal would be designed tocounter Soviet calls for complete denuclearization ofGermany. The White House wouldn't confirm the report.   But U.S. officials fear the West may be hurrying intoother commitments that would cut troop levels in a unitedGermany too deeply. They also are concerned that too muchloose talk of nuclear withdrawals will incite public clamorto remove all short-range nuclear weapons from Germany beforeagreements on such weapons can be negotiated with Moscow.   So the president and his men are saying the NATO meetingmerely should start the process of changing the alliance,rather than complete the job. This is a tricky position forthe U.S. to take because it raises the risk of a clash withWest German leaders, who are eager to accommodate Sovietleader Mikhail Gorbachev so he will let the united Germanybelong to NATO. The Bush administration, which has beenworking assiduously to develop a special relationship withthe emerging new Germany, doesn't want to alienate Germansnow.   The U.S. shares the general German goal; indeed, Mr. Bushhimself called the NATO summit to pave the way for a newGermany's membership in the alliance. U.S. and Germanofficials already have agreed on broad outlines for how tochange NATO. Specifically, they have agreed in principle onthe idea of thinning NATO's front-line troops and puttingthem under multinational commands rather than underindividual member countries.   The NATO meeting is likely to bless such a change, whichwould fundamentally overhaul Western defense strategies andset up a defense structure that could be shrunk as East-Westtensions ease. In addition, the NATO meeting will lay plansto begin negotiations to shrink NATO's nuclear arsenal andperhaps adopt language for a historic non-aggressionagreement between NATO and Warsaw Pact nation.   Yet the U.S. also wants to be sure that it doesn'temasculate NATO, the one European organization in which theU.S plays a dominant role. The U.S. sees a NATO with muscleas essential to its hopes to retain political, economic andmilitary influence in the emerging Europe.   U.S. officials are worried about West Germany's newwillingness to promise the Soviets specific reductions in theunited German army as part of the conventional-arms agreementnow being negotiated in Vienna. While the U.S. and WestGermany, until recently, agreed that they should offer theSoviets some general pledge to shrink the German army afterunification, they resisted negotiating the extent of thereduction until the conventional-arms treaty is finished andfollow-up talks with the Soviets begin.   Now, U.S. officials say, Bonn is suggesting that aspecific pledge be made by inserting in the conventional-armspact a formula defining how many troops any Central Europeancountry can maintain. U.S. officials don't want to commit theWest to a specific troop level before military planners havecalculated the size and configuration of the new NATO.   In addition, while the U.S. has promised to stopmodernizing NATO's arsenal of short-range nuclear missilesand shells and to start negotiating cuts in the stockpile,Mr. Bush and his aides want to squelch any talk that NATOmight scrap its policy of reserving the right to be the firstside to use nuclear weapons.   The U.S. considers the first-use option necessary to guardagainst a conventional attack. More importantly, it worriesthat a no-first-use pledge would help generate publicpressure to pull all nuclear weapons out of Germany withoutwaiting for an orderly negotiating process.   Britain and France, which don't want the public pressingthem to get rid of their own nuclear arsenals, share the U.S.sentiment. So this week's meeting, Secretary of State JamesBaker suggests, &quot;will simply kick off a review&quot; of how theWest will negotiate cuts in short-range nuclear arms.</TEXT></DOC>
