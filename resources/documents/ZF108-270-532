 A few months later, Microsoftsends out OEM Adaptation Kits to other hardware manufacturers -- so they candeliver OS/2 to their customers after they've tested it on their hardware andtweaked its device drivers where necessary.andM;But so far this has only applied to Standard Edition and other PCmanufacturers haven't been able to supply a version of Extended Edition, withits Database and Communications Managers, for their equipment.andM;There are two ways of correcting this imbalance.andP;  When it comes to highlyIBM-compatible PCs, some manufacturers have demonstrated Extended Editionrunning on their PCs -- so that customers had the choice of popping in to anIBM dealer and buying it.andM;But there's still a view that therehs something wrong with this.andP;  OS/2 is acomplex operating system and many people must have felt that althoughExtended Edition seems to run well on a particular PC, compatibility may notbe 100 per cent and something nasty could happen one day.andP;  You wouldn't wantExtended Edition unless you had important data to control with it, and thenof course you want that data to be secure.andM;The other route, for those who want the functionality of Extended Edition butuse a version of OS/2 that has been certified by a hardware manufacturerother than IBM, is the Microsoft SQL Server and Comms Server.andP;  However, thesearen't compatible with their IBM equivalents, which has created something ofa split in the OS/2 world.andP;  Nothing wrong in competition, but you should beable to run the same operating system on different manufacturers' hardware.andM;Another answer is on the horizon -- it hasn't yet been decided when this willhappen, but IBM has taken the decision to 'unbundle' Extended Edition andmake it available on other manufacturers' versions of OS/2.andM;So, in the not too distant future, you'll be able to buy the latest versionof OS/2 from your PC manufacturer, then get the separate box containing theExtended Edition components and install these on top of the operating system.andO;That'll give OS/2 users free choice to use the database system they prefer,regardless of the hardware they are using.andM;The sooner IBM does this, the beter, as it removes the feeling of beingconstrained to IBM equipment, and considerably raises the importance ofExtended Edition for the whole PC community.andP;  Many hardware manufacturers andcustomers agree with IBM on its basic strategy for communications and shareddata, but simply don't want to be tied down.andM;Unbundling Extended Edition shouldn't prove difficult as it already exists asseparate components in IBM OS/2.andP;  When it's installed, you first install thebase operating system (equivalent to Standard Edition) and then install theDatabase Manager and Communications Manager.andM;OS/2 started life without the graphics user interface of PresentationManager.andP;  The original v1.0 had just a text-mode screen for applicationcontrol, and the Extended Edition components ran only in text mode.andP;  Althoughquite a few applications became available to run in OS/2 text-mode screens,the text-only approach didn't catch on as expected, and a number of softwaredevelopers waited for the Presentation Manager to become available.andM;This happened with v1.1, when the Presentation Manager replaced the text-modeprogram selector and provided a graphics interface for suitable applications.andO;The Database and Communications Managers remained as text-mode programs.andM;With v1.2 the user interface has been enhanced considerably and the maincomponents of Extended Edition have also become Presentation Manager windowedprograms.andP;  We reviewed Standard edition v1.2 in issue 117, and of course thechanges described there apply to Extended Edition.andM;I'll run through them briefly here.andP;  The interface itself has been improved,with 3D-style buttons and better use of icons.andP;  You can now move applicationsfrom one group to another by picking up the icon with the mouse, and dothings like execute an application by dropping the icon for a data file on tothe one for the application.andM;The performance of the Presentation Manager has also been improved -- thiscombined with the enhancements to the user interface make it much more usableand more friendly than V1.1.andM;The most important improvement to the base operating system is the facilityfor installable file systems together with the new High Performance FileSystem (HPFS).andP;  Having a standard method for installing a new file systemwill make it easier for developers to integrate devices such as WORMs andCDROMs into an OS/2 system.andM;The HPFS itself offers many advantages over the existing FAT system used withDOS and earlier versions of OS/2.andP;  It should provide much better performancewhen used in disk intensive situations such as a fileserver.andP;  It also allowsfile names to be up to 254 characters in length and preserves ExtendedAttributes for files.andP;  These can be up to 64Kb in size, and can containinformation such as the author of a file, the application that it belongs to,or any other information an application cares to put into it.andM;Extended Edition also contains many new features, and our review of theevaluation copy that we received from IBM will follow in the next issue.andP;  Inthe meantime, here are its main enhancements.andM;IBM has included a proper procedure for both installing and removing DatabaseManager and Communications Manager.andP;  You get to the main menu for thisautomatically when you install the base operating system, and can return toit any time with a single command.andM;Along the same lines of user-friendliness is Basic Configuration Services forCommunications Manager, also available both at any time and within theinstallation process.andP;  This makes the setting up of configuration files muchless complicated as it supplies many settings as defaults -- it's a muchneeded 'get up and go quickly' routine for communications.andM;Once it's all up and running, the obvious difference between versions 1.1 and1.2 is that most of the text-mode screens have been replaced by PresentationManager windows.andP;  There's also an important new facility in the installedapplications -- User Profile Management.andM;This simplifies one area of confusion which existed with earlier versions ofExtended Edition and LAN Server -- security.andP;  It used to be the case thatsecurity was handled separated for both the LAN and Database Manager.andP;  Nowthese are unified and User Profile Management handles the authority levelsfor administrators, users and groups of users for both of those components,plus some aspects of the Communications Manager.andP;  This gives a single pointof administration on a network and should make the whole system tighter.andM;This feature had to be built in to Extended Edition v1.2 as the DatabaseManager is now capable of operating across a network.andP;  It'll still work instand-alone mode as with previous versions, but a new component has beenadded called Remote Data Services.andP;  It's this that allows users to log-on toa database existing on another Extended Edition machine.andM;For communication with other Database Managers across a network the methodused is Advanced Program-to-Program Communication (APPC).andP;  This replacesNamed Pipes which are limited to use within a local area network.andP;  But withAPPC, a future version of Extended Edition will be able to access databaseson host systems, such as DB2 running on MVS nor SQL/DS on VM.andM;One exception to the use of APPC is from a DOS workstation.andM;Database Manager still includes the Query Manager (now a Presentation Managerprogram) for defining databases and entering data into them, and for creatingforms and panels for application purposes.andP;  It now has a couple of otherfeatures.andP;  Operational Status lets you grab information on database activity-- this would be mainly for administration purposes and should beparticularly useful during fault analysis.andP;  The Query Manager now also hasits own callable interface which allows application programs to access thecommands controlling features such as the panels and the menus.andM;Also for developers is the new Dialog Manager.andP;  This is a programming toolwhich uses its own Dialog Tag Language to simplify the creation of anyPresentation Manager applications that access databases.andP;  It helps with thework of creating panels and other aspects of the user interface so thatdevelopers needn't be concerned with the details of programming thePresentation Manager, but can concentrate more on the main needs of theapplication.andM;An important new feature built into the engine of Database Manager is supportfor preserving referential integrity.andP;  This becomes relevant when rows ofdata in one table are related to rows in one or more others and an operationon one table without some other action being taken on others might createlogical inconsistencies.andP;  For example, you wouldn't want to delete the mainrow for a customer in one table when another table contains a row indicatingan active account.andM;Communications Manager now supports an SNA gateways so that users on a LANcan directly access a host System/370.andP;  Up to 64 workstations can be activeon a network in this way at any one time.andM;Support is now included for 5250 emulation -- connection to an AS/400 -- andthere's now also support for X.25 and Ethernet connections (even IBM actuallyadmits that this is surprising).andM;Some of the other enhancements in Extended Edition v1.2 are quite minor, butoverall they add up to a significant new release.andP;  And many of them will becovered in our review in the next issue, issue 128.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
