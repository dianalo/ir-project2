Executive Summary </ITAG>The Commission is proposing major revisions to the procedures for registeringemployee benefit plan securities on Form S-8. These proposals are intendedto reduce costs to registrants by eliminating the need to prepare and fileseparate documents for federal securities law purposes that duplicate informationotherwise provided to plan participants, while assuring timely deliveryof information necessary for participants to make informed investment decisions.Under the proposed approach, the plan information (excluding plan financialstatements) and a statement of documents available upon request to planparticipants,\14\<NOTE/> currently required to be set forth in the Form S-8 registrationstatement, would be required to be delivered to participants, but wouldnot be included in the Form S-8 registration statement and would not berequired to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424. The informationdelivered to participants would not be required to be in the form of acustomary prospectus. Instead, the information could be provided in oneor several documents prepared in the ordinary course of employee communications,giving registrants the flexibility to use material written by company compensationor personnel specialists to advise employees  about their benefits. Registrantsalso could use material required to be prepared for plan participants bythe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (``ERISA''),\15\<NOTE/> provided that the information is current for federal securitieslaw purposes. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ For purposes of this release, the terms ``plan participants,''``participants,'' and ``employees'' refer to employees eligible to participatein a benefit plan, and with respect to the proposals, include consultantsand advisors. <T3>See </T3>Section III.D.3., <T3>infra,</T3> regarding the proposed availability of Form S-8 for theissuance of securities to consultants and advisors. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Pub. L. No. 93-406, 88 Stat. 832 (codified at 29 U.S.C.1001, <T3>et seq.</T3>). The plan information required to be delivered to participants, a writtenstatement advising participants of the availability upon request of documentsincorporated by reference in the registration statement and prospectus,and the documents incorporated by reference would constitute the prospectussatisfying the requirements of Securities Act Section 10(a) \16\<NOTE/> pursuant to proposed new Rule 428. The documents containingregistrant and plan financial information would be included in both theprospectus and registration statement through incorporation by referenceof Exchange Act filings. The registrant would continue to be required todeliver the documents incorporated by reference upon a participant's request.\17\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ 15 U.S.C. 77j(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ Both new and existing requirements to deliver informationto employees would be set forth in proposed Rule 428(b), rather than asundertakings. Accordingly, the undertakings currently required by Item512(f) of Regulation S-K would be rescinded. Many employee benefit plans involve the registration not only of employersecurities, but also of interests in the plan constituting separate securities.\18\<NOTE/> To simplify the process of  registering and reporting onplan interests, the Commission proposes to: (1) Amend Form 11-K, the annualreport for employee benefit plans, to require only plan financial statements;(2) permit Securities Act registration of an indeterminate amount of planinterests; \19\<NOTE/> and (3) simplify the calculation of filing fees by specificallyproviding that there are no additional fees for registered plan interests.\20\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ <T3>See</T3> n. 42, <T3>infra.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ Proposed new Rule 416A. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ Proposed Rule 457(h)(2). In addition, the Commission proposes to relax the eligibility requirementsfor use of Form S-8. As proposed, the form could be used by any registrantreporting under the Exchange Act, rather than only those that have beenreporting for 90 days. In lieu of a Rule 14a-3 annual report to securityholders, registrants would be permitted to deliver to plan participantsother documents containing substantially the same information.\21\<NOTE/> Form S-8 also would be made available for securities issuedpursuant to compensatory written contracts and for securities issued tocompensate consultants and advisors employed by the registrant. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ 17 CFR 240.14a-3. Other proposals to expedite employee benefit plan offerings and reducecosts and interpretive questions include: automatic effectiveness of FormS-8 registration statements upon filing; \22\<NOTE/> clarification of filing fees for employee benefit  plans;\23\<NOTE/> simplification of procedures for the registration of additionalplan securities; \24\<NOTE/> modification of the Form S-8 disclosure requirements; andreorganization and amendment of the Form S-8's provisions for resale.\25\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Proposed new Rule 462.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ Proposed revisions to Rule 457(h). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ Proposed General Instruction E. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ Proposed revisions to General Instruction C. Part IV of the release contains two charts, the first showing proposedchanges to Form S-8 and the second comparing the current undertakings todeliver information required pursuant to Item 512(f) of Regulation S-K,which would be rescinded, to the proposed requirements of Rule 428(b).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background </ITAG>Form S-8, for registration of securities offered pursuant to employee benefitplans,\26\<NOTE/> has an abbreviated disclosure format reflecting the Commission'shistoric distinction between offerings made to employees primarily forcompensatory and incentive purposes and offerings made to raise capitalto finance a registrant's business. Securities offerings under employeebenefit plans are undertaken to attract, compensate, and retain qualifiedemployees. Recognizing the benefits to employees of participating in suchplans, the Commission traditionally has   exercised its rulemaking authorityto reduce the costs and burdens incident to registration, where consistentwith investor protection.\27\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ Securities Act Rule 405 [17 CFR 230.405] defines ``employeebenefit plan'' as any purchase, savings, option, bonus, appreciation, profitsharing, thrift, incentive, pension or similar plan solely for employees,directors, trustees or officers. <T3>See</T3> Release Nos. 33-3480 (June 16, 1953) [18 FR 3688], 33-4533(Aug. 30, 1962) [27 FR 9213] and 33-5767 (Nov. 22, 1976) [41 FR 52662].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ This form first was made available for registering certainsecurities offerings to employees in 1953. (Release No. 33-3480). Significantreleases issued to amend and interpret Form S-8 are as follows: For rulemakingactions adopting Form S-8 and extending its availability to different typesof securities and plans, <T3>see</T3>: Release No. 33-4533; and 33-5767.

The release furtherstates that such registrant information need not be furnished to the Commissionif otherwise furnished pursuant to different requirements. Of particularsignificance are the steps taken in Release No. 33-6190 (Feb. 22, 1980)[45 FR 13438] permitting automatic effectiveness of initial filings onthe twentieth day after filing and automatic effectiveness of post-effectiveamendments on filing, and Release No. 33-6202 (April 2, 1980) [45 FR 23653]extending the principles of incorporation by reference to Form S-8. <T3>See also</T3> Release No. 33-6188 (Feb. 1, 1980) [45 FR 8960] analyzingthe application of the Securities Act to employee benefit plans; ReleaseNo. 33-6281, pt. IV(C) (Jan. 15, 1981) [46 FR 8446] outlining staff interpretivepositions regarding the incorporation by reference in a Form S-8 prospectusof plan information contained in an ERISA Summary Plan Description andupdating techniques; and Release No. 33-6371 (Dec. 23, 1981) [46 FR 63437]reminding Form S-8 registrants of the requirements regarding signaturesand experts' consents. A. Common Provisions of Plans Using Form S-8 Form S-8 is available to a wide range of employee benefit plans that offeremployer securities to employees upon specified terms.\28\<NOTE/> The following discusses the provisions commonly includedin plans pursuant to which securities are registered on Form S-8.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ Depending on the nature of the plan, an employee mayhave the opportunity to invest money in employer securities either directlyor through an intermediary, <T3>e.g.,</T3> a trust fund. As a general rule, registration under theSecurities Act is required for offerings of interests or participationsin pooled investment vehicles, as in the case of thrift or  savings plans,where the plan is both voluntary and contributory on the part of the employeeand permits the investment of employee money in the issuer's securities.(<T3>See</T3> Release No. 33-6188, pt. II(A)). <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Stock Acquisition Plans </ITAG>Form S-8 is used most frequently to register common stock that is to beissued in connection with stock option plans. Stock options typically aregranted to select groups of management or highly compensated employees,giving the holder the right to acquire employer stock at a fixed pricefor a stated period of time. Such executive compensation plans generallyprovide for either incentive stock options (``ISO''), which receive specialtax treatment, or nonqualified stock options,\29\<NOTE/> or allow the company the flexibility to grant either or both.Qualifying ISO plans meet the requirements of Section 422A of the InternalRevenue Code (``Code''), which among other things, sets limitations onthe exercise price of the option at the time of the grant and on the holdingperiod of the underlying stock following exercise of the ISO.\30\<NOTE/> Neither the grant nor the exercise of ISOs is a taxable eventfor the employee.\31\<NOTE/> In contrast, non-qualified plans are not subject to the limitationsapplicable to ISO plans and exercise of the option generally is a taxableevent for the employee, but the granting corporation receives a correspondingdeduction.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ Nonqualified stock options are also known as nonstatutorystock options. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ 26 U.S.C. 422A. Code Section 422A(b) [26 U.S.C. 422A(b)]mandates the features of an ISO plan. That section provides, in part, thatthe exercise price of an ISO must not be less than the fair market valueof the underlying stock at the time of grant under a plan approved by thegranting corporation's shareholders. Pursuant to Code Section 422A(a) [26U.S.C. 422A(a)], an employee may not dispose of stock acquired under theplan within two years from the grant of the option or within one year afterits exercise. An ISO plan is not subject to ERISA [Dept. of Labor Advis.Op. 79-50A (1979-1981 Transfer Binder) Pension Plan Guide (CCH) andpara;25,413].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ Code Section 422A(a). The sale of the underlying stockis a taxable event for the employee; the granting corporation does notreceive a deduction. Stock acquisition plans using Form S-8 also may provide for the grant ofoptions to all employees in compliance with Code Section 423.\32\<NOTE/> Code Section 423 stock purchase plans must satisfy requirementssimilar to certain of those applicable to ISOs in order to receive specialtax treatment with respect to the options issued.\33\<NOTE/> However, unlike ISO plans designed to compensate key personnel,Section 423 plans must grant options to all employees of the registranton a nondiscriminatory basis.\34\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ 26 U.S.C. 423. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ Code Section 423(b) [26 U.S.C. 423(b)] stipulates, inpart: The option price may not be less than the lesser of 85% of the fairmarket value of the underlying stock determined either (i) at the timeof grant of the option or (ii) at the time of exercise of the option; whileoptions must grant the same rights and privileges to each employee, thenumber of shares covered by the options may vary according to a uniformrelationship to total compensation; and an employee cannot receive optionswith respect to stock with a fair market value in excess of $25,000 duringany calendar year. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ Id. Finally, plans using Form S-8 commonly contain provisions for the grantor sale of ``restricted'' stock.\35\<NOTE/> Under such arrangements, the corporation may give stock outrightfor no consideration, receive partial or full consideration from the employeeor reserve the flexibility to set the consideration within a broad range.Similarly, the corporation may reserve the right to establish the conditionsthat must be satisfied before the employee may exercise all ownership rightswith respect to the securities.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ In this context, ``restricted'' refers to the fact thatemployee rights in the stock are contingent upon a future event and thereforehave not vested.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. ERISA Deferred Compensation Plans </ITAG>A considerable number of plans that use Form S-8 are deferred compensationplans subject to ERISA. All of these ERISA plans are defined contributionplans \36\<NOTE/> that provide for an employee's systematic deferral of income.Plan contributions are made to a trust, managed by a trustee, bank, investmentadvisor or employer. The trust may contain a single pool of securitiesor several investment funds with plan assets invested in a variety of investmentmedia in addition to employer securities (such as fixed income governmentsecurities or a diversified portfolio of equity or debt securities).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ A defined contribution plan requires specified or determinablecontributions. The amount of benefits paid depends, in addition to thelevel of contributions, on the degree of investment success and the amountof non-vested benefits allocated from employees whose interests terminate.Each employee in this type of plan has a separate account reflecting hisor her interest in the plan investments.ERISA plans are subject to reporting and disclosure requirements \37\<NOTE/> and must adhere to fiduciary standards governing transactionsbetween plans and interested persons.\38\<NOTE/> The ERISA plans registered on Form S-8 generally qualifyfor preferential tax status \39\<NOTE/> under Code Section 401(a) (``qualified plans'').\40\<NOTE/>   Qualified plans must satisfy coverage, participation, vestingand benefit accrual standards that are intended to assure that plans areestablished for the exclusive benefit of employees and prevent discriminationin favor of highly compensated individuals. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ ERISA requires that financial and other plan informationbe reported to the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Laborand disclosed to plan participants and their beneficiaries. Among otherthings, such requirements are intended to give plan participants informationabout their benefit rights and access to plan financial information. ERISASection 101(b) [29 U.S.C. 1021(b)] requires the administrator of an ERISAplan to file with the Secretary of Labor an annual report, a summary plandescription (``SPD''), a report of modifications and changes in the plan,and additional reports upon the termination of the plan. Under ERISA Section104 [29 U.S.C. 1024], the administrator must furnish the SPD to each participantand each beneficiary who is receiving benefits under the plan. The SPDis, essentially, a written report describing the most significant featuresof a plan. The administrator also is required under that section to furnishparticipants a summary of the financial statements and schedules includedin the annual report and such other information as is necessary to summarizethat data fairly (``summary annual report''). The actual statements andschedules must be provided upon request. <T3>See</T3> n.73, <T3>infra</T3>, for ERISA timing requirements for the delivery of SPDsto participants. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ Part 4 of Title I of ERISA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ An employer sponsoring a qualified retirement plan maydeduct contributions to the plan in the year such contributions are made,subject to the limits of Section 404 of the Code [26 U.S.C. 404]. The employeeon whose behalf such contributions are made will not realize gross incomeuntil such amounts are distributed. Finally, the trust itself is not taxed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ 26 U.S.C. 401(a). Securities Act Section 3(a)(2) [15U.S.C. 77c(a)(2)] exempts from registration under Section 5 of that Act[15 U.S.C. 77e] interests or participations in plans qualified under InternalRevenue Code Section 401 [26 U.S.C. 401], except such plans under whichan amount in excess of the employer's contribution is allocated to thepurchase of employer securities. Securities Act Release No. 33-6188, atpt. IV(B)(2); <T3>Amicus curiae</T3> brief filed by Commission in October, 1980 in <T3>Newkirk</T3> v. <T3>Electric Co.,</T3> No. 80-4202 (9th Cir.) (on appeal from 1979-1980Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) andpara; 97,216 (N.D. Cal. 1979) (settled beforedecided on appeal)). Plans qualified under Section 401(a) are exempt fromthe provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 pursuant to Section(3)(c)(11) of that Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(11)]. The ERISA plans that register on Form S-8 generally are ``thrift'' or ``savings''plans including a Code Section 401(k) \41\<NOTE/>  salary reduction arrangement, which allows employees tocontribute part of their pretax earnings through payroll deductions. Employercontributions to thrift/savings plans usually are allocated in proportionto the amounts that are contributed by employees. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ 26 U.S.C. 401(k). A 401(k) plan in which employee monies,including voluntary salary reductions or deferrals, may be used to purchaseemployer securities is contributory on the part of employees and the employer'soffer and sale of its securities must be registered or exempt from registration.Further, the plan interests are themselves securities and the Section 3(a)(2)exemption for interests in the plan is unavailable. <T3>See</T3> letter re <T3>Diasonics, Inc.,</T3> available Dec. 29, 1982. In that event, the offerand sale of plan interests must be registered or otherwise exempt fromregistration. <ITAG tagnum="28">In the event that the 401(k) plan is a profit sharing or stock bonusplan that only provides for employer contributions and employees may electannually either (1) to receive currently the employer's contribution or(2) to defer receipt and have the funds invested in the trust for distributionupon retirement, interests in the plan are not subject to the SecuritiesAct even if the trust invests the deferred employer contribution in employersecurities. This type of plan is not considered to be contributory on thepart of employees because it does not involve out-of-pocket investmentsby employees of their own funds. For that reason, Securities Act registrationis not required with respect to these plans. </ITAG><T3>See</T3> Release No. 33-6281, pt. I(B). B. Current Form S-8 Requirements<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Eligibility </ITAG>Form S-8 may be used to register offers and sales of: (1) securities ofan eligible issuer to its employees, or to employees of its subsidiariesor parents, pursuant to any employee benefit plan; and (2) interests insuch plans that constitute separate securities and are required to be registeredunder the Securities Act.\42\<NOTE/> Issuers \43\<NOTE/> are eligible to use Form S-8 if, at the time of filing aregistration statement on that form, they (a) have been subject to ExchangeAct Section 13 or 15(d) \44\<NOTE/> reporting requirements for at least 90 days; (b) have filedall required reports during the previous 12 months (or   such shorter periodas they have been required to file); and (c) have furnished or will furnishto security holders an annual report containing substantially the informationrequired by Exchange Act Rule 14a-3.\45\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ Whether a separate security in the form of a plan interestexists depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular plan.Securities Act Release Nos. 33-6l88, pt. II(A) and 33-6281, pts. I andII discuss some of the criteria to be considered in making such a determination.An employee's interest in an involuntary, non-contributory defined benefitplan is not a security. <T3>International Brotherhood of Teamsters</T3> v.<T3> Daniel,</T3> 439 U.S. 551 (1979). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ As used in Form S-8, the term ``issuer'' means the personwhose securities are to be offered pursuant to the plan, <T3>i.e.,</T3> the employer or its parent or subsidiary. Form S-8 as revisedwould use the term ``registrant'' to be consistent with other forms andrules. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ 15 U.S.C. 78m and 78o(d).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ This information consists of audited financial statements,other specified financial information, management's discussion and analysisof financial condition and results of operations (Item 303 of RegulationS-K [17 CFR 229.303]), and other information about the company's business,management and securities. Where plan interests are being registered, Form S-8 requires the plan,at the time of filing, either to (a) have been subject to Exchange ActSection 15(d)\46\<NOTE/> for at least 90 days and be current in its filings thereunder;or (b) file, concurrently with the filing of the Form S-8 registrationstatement, an annual report on Form 11-K for its latest fiscal year (or,if the plan has not yet completed its first fiscal year, for a period endingnot more than 90 days prior to the filing date).

The proposed amendmentsto Form S-8 would eliminate the requirement that registrants prepare aseparate document for federal securities law purposes in order to conveyplan information to employees in connection with offers and sales of securitiesbeing made under an employee benefit plan. Instead, based on a recognitionthat materials containing plan information generally are prepared by personneland employee relations offices, the proposals would require that completeand current plan information be delivered to employees in a timely fashion,but would not specify a legal format for that information, which   couldbe contained in one or more documents provided to plan participants.\60\<NOTE/> Furthermore, it would no longer be necessary to fi1e thisplan information with the Commission, either as part of the registrationstatement or pursuant to Rule 424.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ As proposed, Form S-8 would be available for compensatorywritten contracts, see Section III.D.3. <T3>infra</T3>.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ <T3>See </T3>Release No. 33-4844 (August 5, 1966) [31 FR 10667] requestingregistrants to use clear and understandable language in disclosing planinformation in the prospectus.

As more fully discussed below, under the proposed amendments, a registrantwould continue to be required to take three steps to disseminate materialinformation to plan participants in connection with the offer and saleof employee, benefit plan securities: (1) deliver to participants, andupdate as necessary, specified non-financial plan information; (2) accompanyor precede the plan information with an annual report to security holdersor other document containing audited financial statements and other specifiedinformation for the registrant's latest fiscal year;\61\<NOTE/> and (3) notify participants of the availability, upon request,of documents containing registrant information and, if applicable, planfinancial statements that are incorporated by reference in the Form S-8registration statement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ <T3>See</T3> Section III.D.2., <T3>infra</T3>.

Prospectus Requirements <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Section 10(a) Prospectus Content, Delivery and Updating; Exemptionfrom Rule 424 </ITAG>Proposed Form S-8 would dispense with the use of a customary prospectusfiled with the registration statement as the means of providing disclosureto plan participants. In its place, registrants would meet their SecuritiesAct Section 5 \65\<NOTE/> prospectus delivery obligations by providing plan participants:(1) document(s) containing the plan information required by Form S-8, updatedas necessary; \66\<NOTE/> and (2) a written statement advising participants of theavailability, upon request, of the documents incorporated by referencein the registration statement and stating that those documents are incorporatedby reference in the prospectus.\67\<NOTE/> These delivered documents, together with the documents incorporatedby reference,\68\<NOTE/> would    constitute, pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of proposednew Rule 428, a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10(a) ofthe Securities Act (``Section 10(a) prospectus'').\69\<NOTE/> The Section    10(a) prospectus would not be required tobe filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424, as proposed to be amended.Paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 428 would specify the mechanics of disseminatingand updating the required plan information.\70\<NOTE/> Finally, paragraph (c) of proposed Rule 428 would definethe terms ``employee'' and ``employee benefit plan'' in the same manneras Form S-8, as proposed to be revised.    <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ Securities Act Section 5(b)(2) [15 U.S.C. 77e(b)(2)]requires that a Section 10(a) prospectus accompany or precede the deliveryfor sale or after sale of any security with respect to which a registrationstatement has been filed. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ Part I, Item 1 of proposed Form S-8. <T3>See </T3>Section III.D.7, <T3>infra, </T3>for a discussion of the modification of the disclosurerequirements of current Form S-8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\67\ Part I, Item 2 of proposed Form S-8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\ Part II, Item 3 of proposed Form S-8 would retain currentrequirements (<T3>see </T3>n.49, <T3>supra, </T3>for the current requirements); documents would be incorporatedby reference in the registration statement as well as in the prospectus.In addition, proposed Item 3 would permit incorporation by reference ofan effective Exchange Act registration statement on Form 10 [17 CFR 249.210]or 20-F [17 CFR 249.220f] as an alternative to an annual report or Rule424(b) prospectus. The following documents would be incorporated by referenceinto the registration statement and Section 10(a) prospectus: <ITAG tagnum="28">(1) The registrant's latest annual report and, where plan interestsare being registered, the plan's latest annual financial report filed pursuantto Exchange Act Section 13(a) or 15(d), or specified other documents containingaudited financial statements for the registrant's latest fiscal year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(2) All other reports filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) ofthe Exchange Act since the end of the fiscal year covered by the documentreferred to in (1) above; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(3) If the class of securities to be offered is registered under ExchangeAct Section 12, the description of that class contained in a registrationstatement filed thereunder, including any amendment or report filed forthe purpose of updating that description; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(4) All documents filed subsequently by the registrant pursuant toExchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 and 15(d). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">An accountant's consent would continue to be required with respectto audited financial statements incorporated by reference.

Paragraph (c) of Section 10 [15 U.S.C. 77j(c)] allows the Commissionto include in a prospectus additional information, as necessary or appropriatein the public interest or for the protection of investors. Accordingly,although plan information would not be contained in a Form S-8 registrationstatement, the Commission is requiring plan information to be a part ofthe Section 10(a) prospectus, pursuant to proposed new Rule 428(a)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ Proposed Rule 428(b) would address the registrant's requirementsconcerning the delivery of non-financial plan information required by PartI of Form S-8 and the delivery, upon request, of registrant (and plan,if applicable) information incorporated by reference in Part II of theregistration statement. Other information delivery requirements relatingto Form S-8 now required as undertakings pursuant to Item 512(f) of RegulationS-K would be revised as appropriate and moved to Rule 428(b). Item 512(f)would be rescinded.    Comment is requested on whether only required plan information containedin each of the delivered documents, rather than the entire document, shouldbe deemed part of the Section 10(a) prospectus. If the Section 10(a) prospectuswere to contain only required portions of the documents, an adequate meansof identification of such portions, for liability purposes, would be necessary.Therefore, commentators favoring a Section 10(a) prospectus covering onlyrequired information, rather than the entire document, should recommenda practical means for identification of this information.Under the proposals, a registrant could deliver to plan participants informationconcerning the plan, its operation and participants' rights and obligationsunder the plan in one or more documents that the registrant prepares inthe ordinary course of business. A registrant could, of course, elect toprepare and deliver a single document resembling a customary prospectus,but the new Form S-8 would permit a variety of other approaches. For example,one document might set forth the terms and salient features of the plan,while a separate written statement would discuss current tax information.\71\<NOTE/> Registrants could use SPDs as the basic disclosure document,as permitted currently.\72\<NOTE/> However, although ERISA allows several months after commencementof a plan for preparation of an SPD,\73\<NOTE/> it might have to be completed prior to the ERISA deadlinein order to be available for use in connection with offers and sales ofsecurities under the plans. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ Tax information is currently required by Item 4 of FormS-8 and the proposals would retain that disclosure requirement. <T3>See</T3> proposed new Item 1(a)(3). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ <T3>See</T3> n.48, <T3>supra.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\ ERISA requires the plan administrator to furnish an SPDto each plan participant either within 90 days after an employee becomesparticipant or within 120 days after the plan becomes subject to ERISA[29 U.S.C. 1024(b)(1)]. Because the plan document(s) and required written statement concerningavailability of information would not be filed with the Commission, registrantswould be required to date each such document and include a printed or stampedlegend stating: ``This  material constitutes part of the prospectus coveringthese securities, which have been registered under the Securities Act of1933.''\74\<NOTE/> Registrants also would be required to maintain a file ofthe legended documents for three years after the securities had been offeredor sold and to furnish a copy of those materials to the Commission or itsstaff upon request.\75\<NOTE/> Comment is requested on whether the three year file maintenancerequirement is adequate or the period should be longer, such as five orseven years. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\ Proposed Rule 428(b)(1). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\75\ Proposed Rule 428(a)(2). The three-year period comportswith the statute of limitations in Section 13 of the Securities Act [77U.S.C. 77m]. If questions should arise as to the adequacy of the plan information constitutingpart of the Section 10(a) prospectus, the legending and file maintenancerequirements should facilitate identification of those communications thatconstitute the Section 10(a) prospectus and minimize disputes about theregistrant's intention to rely on a particular document to meet its Section5 prospectus delivery obligation. Of course, any delivered plan informationwhich is not made a part of the Section 10(a) prospectus would continueto be subject to the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.\76\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\76\ Securities Act Section 17(a), (15 U.S.C. 77q(a); ExchangeAct Section 10(b) (15 U.S.C. 78j(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 CFR 240.1Ob-5]. Pursuant to Securities Act Section 12(2),\77\<NOTE/> a registrant would be required to deliver current and completeplan information. Accordingly, documents containing plan information wouldhave to be updated to reflect material changes.\78\<NOTE/> The plan information could be updated simply by providingplan participants with a letter or memorandum. Of course, care would haveto be taken that the information is presented in an organized and understandablefashion. As with information initially furnished, the updated informationwould have to be stamped with the same statement indicating that such informationconstituted part of the Section 10(a) prospectus. Existing participantswould be furnished the updating material; the registrant would be requiredto re-deliver previously furnished document(s) only upon a participant'srequest. If updates become so numerous that they obscure plan disclosures,for new plan participants, a registrant would be required to revise theoriginal plan document(s).\79\<NOTE/> Comment is requested on whether the proposed approach fordelivery of plan information is a practical method and provides employeeswith adequate safeguards under the federal securities laws. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\77\ 15 U.S.C. 77<T3>l</T3>(2). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ The updating procedures for plan and other informationare briefly described in proposed General Instruction G to Form S-8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ Proposed Rule 428(b)(1).

Section 11 of the Securities Act imposesliability for material misstatements or omissions contained in a registrationstatement when it becomes effective.

Section 11 also imposes liability on a wide variety of otherdefendants, such as persons who signed the registration statement, directorsof the issuer at the time the statement is filed, persons who consentedto be named in the statement, experts who consented to be named in thestatement, and underwriters. The compensatory nature of security offerings under employee benefit plansand the relationship between registrants and plan participants provideincentives for the preparation and distribution of accurate and completeplan information even though the registrant would no longer be subjectto strict liability with respect to that information.\81\<NOTE/> Further, Section 12(2) and the antifraud provisions wouldcontinue to apply to the  information. Accordingly, the proposed approachshould not increase the risk of inadequate disclosure to plan participants.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ A review of the reported cases asserting liability underthe federal securities laws in connection with employee benefit plans indicatesthat they have been based upon Sections 17(a) and 12(2) of the SecuritiesAct and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ratherthan Section 11.

Asa result, the business and financial information regarding the registrantwould be available to employees. Comment is requested  on whether thereis any need to retain the 90-day eligibility requirement for using FormS-8.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Requirements for the Delivery of Registrant Information </ITAG>Currently, to be eligible to use Form S-8, a registrant must either havefurnished, at the time of filing a Form S-8 registration statement, anannual report to security holders for its latest fiscal year containingsubstantially the information required by Exchange Act Rule 14a-3, or furnishsuch a report after the filing of the registration statement.\90\<NOTE/> Whenever the prospectus is delivered to participants, theannual report to security holders must accompany it, unless previouslyfurnished.\91\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\90\ General Instruction A(1) to current Form S-8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\91\ Current Item 512(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. <T3>See </T3>n.45, <T3>supra, </T3>for the information required by Rule 14a-3. The Commission proposes to rescind the mandated use of the annual reportto security holders and provide flexibility by permitting a registrantto use any one of several documents to provide this information to participantsin lieu of an annual report to security holders \9\\2\<NOTE/>: a Securities Act Rule 424(b) prospectus, an annual reporton Form 10-K or 20-F,\93\<NOTE/> or an effective registration statement filed on Form 10 or20-F under the Exchange Act.\94\<NOTE/> A registrant would be required to deliver any one of thesedocuments, containing audited financial statements for its latest fiscalyear, to participants along with the non-financial plan information. Thus,a registrant not subject to the annual report to security holders requirementof Rule 14a-3 or Rule 14c-3,\95\<NOTE/> and not choosing to prepare such a report, would nonethelessbe eligible to use Form S-8.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\92\ Proposed Rule 428(b)(2). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\93\ The Commission proposes to rescind current Item 512(f)(4)of Regulation S-K, relating to the use of Form 20-F by foreign privateissuers in lieu of the annual report to security holders, because proposedRule 428(b)(2) would specifically permit such issuers to use Form 20-For Form F-1. In addition, current Instruction E to Form S-8, relating toforeign private issuers, is proposed to be rescinded as unnecessary becausethe use of Form 20-F would be provided for in proposed Rule 428(b)(2) andthe second part of the Instruction, concerning reoffers, would be dealtwith in General Instruction C (<T3>see</T3> Section III.D.8, <T3>infra</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\94\ The documents used would have to contain substantiallythe same information as required by Rule 14a-3, particularly the management'sdiscussion and analysis, except for certain documents delivered by foreignprivate issuers using Form 20-F (Forms F-1 [17 CFR 239.31] and 20-F) andregistrants complying with the requirements of Form S-18 [17 CFR 239.28](Forms S-18 and 10-K), which would contain the textual and financial informationappropriate to those forms. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\95\ 17 CFR 240.14c-3. Finally, the proposals would continue to obligate a Form S-8 registrantto furnish on a continuing basis shareholder communications and other reportsto plan participants who do not otherwise receive such information.\96\<NOTE/> However, participants in a plan who elect not to invest inemployer securities do not have the same need for these shareholder communications;therefore, the Commission is proposing to codify staff interpretation byrequiring delivery of such information only to those who are participatingin plan funds that invest in  employer securities or those who requestthat information.\97\<NOTE/> In addition, registrants would no longer be required underthe proposals to deliver shareholder communications and other reports ``inthe same manner'' as those materials are sent to shareholders. This changewould permit registrants to deliver such information by any means reasonablycalculated to reach plan participants, provided that delivery is no lessprompt than for shareholders. For example, ``desk-top'' delivery wouldbe permissible.\98\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\96\ Proposed Rule 428(b)(5): current Item 512(f)(2) of RegulationS-K. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\97\ Letter re <T3>Union Carbide</T3>, available Dec. 14, 1981. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\98\ Letter re <T3>Revlon, Inc.</T3>, available July 6, 1984. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Use of Form S-8 for Securities Issued Pursuant to CompensatoryContracts; to Consultants and Advisors; and to Former Employees </ITAG>Several changes to Form S-8 are proposed in order to permit its use fora wider universe of plan participants and employee compensatory arrangements.First, the proposed amendment to General Instruction A.1(a) would specifythat the form is available not only for securities offered pursuant toan employee benefit plan, but also for securities offered pursuant to compensatoryarrangements that take the form of individually negotiated written contracts.Further, proposed Form S-8 could be used by registrants for offerings toconsultants or advisors pursuant to compensatory benefit plans or writtencontracts. General Instruction A.1(a) of Form S-8 would define the term``employee'' to include consultants or advisors, provided that bona fideservices are rendered by such persons to a registrant in connection withits   business and such services are not in connection with the offeringor sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction. This proposed amendmentis based on the conditions set forth in Securities Act Rule 701\99\<NOTE/> for exempting from registration offers and sales of securitiesby non-reporting companies pursuant to certain compensatory benefit plansor written contracts.\100\<NOTE/> Securities issuances to consultants and advisors were includedwithin the scope of that exemption in response to public comments.\101\<NOTE/> Commentators argued that if securities issuances to suchparties are primarily compensatory rather than for capital-raising purposes,there is no meaningful basis for distinguishing between issuances to regularemployees and those to consultants or advisors employed by the registrant.Comment is requested on the advisability of making Form S-8 available forofferings to consultants and advisors and on the appropriateness of theproposed standard that would apply to such issuances.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\99\ 17 CFR 230.701. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\100\ Release No. 33-6768 (April 14, 1988) [53 FR 12918].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\101\ Rule 701 was initially proposed in Release No. 33-6683(January 16, 1987) [52 FR 3015].

Immediate Effectiveness of Form S-8 Registration Statements </ITAG>Proposed new Rule 462 would provide for the automatic effectiveness ofa Form S-8 registration statement upon filing.\104\<NOTE/> Based on its experience with the 20-day waiting period currentlyrequired, as well as the automatic effectiveness of post-effective amendmentson Form S-8, the Commission believes that eliminating the waiting periodwould have little impact on the quality of disclosure in such filings andwould not be detrimental to plan participants, and that the public interestwould be served by prompt effectiveness of such filings.\105\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\104\ Rule 475a would be amended to remove the reference topre-effective amendments to Form S-8, since there would be none. Post-effectiveamendments would continue to be effective upon filing as provided by Rule464. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\105\ General Instruction D to Form S-8 would be revised tostate that registration statements become effective on filing and eliminatethe references to pre-effective amendments. In addition, this Instructionwould be modified to: (1) clarify that requests for confidential treatmentof portions of Exchange Act documents incorporated by reference into theForm S-8 be treated in the same manner as such requests made with respectto the Form S-8 under the Securities Act; and (2) remove as unnecessarythe requirements to furnish the Commission copies of amendments markedto show changes and copies of documents incorporated by reference. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Automatic Registration of Plan Interests; Method of CalculatingFees </ITAG>The Commission is proposing to add new Rule 416A to provide that a registrationstatement covering both registrant securities offered pursuant to an employeebenefit plan and plan interests that constitute separate securities wouldbe deemed to cover such plan interests in an indeterminate amount.\106\<NOTE/> The facing page of Form S-8 would be modified to requireregistrants to include a statement, where appropriate, indicating thatthe registration statement covers an indeterminate amount of plan interests.In effect, plan interests would be automatically registered together withthe other securities being offered. Proposed Rule 416A, along with therevision of the filing fee rule to clarify that no separate fee is payablewith respect to plan interests, as discussed below, should reduce interpretivequestions and practical difficulties associated with the mechanics of registeringplan interests. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\106\ Proposed new General Instruction F would direct registrants'attention to the Rule. A proposed revision of Rule 457(h) \107\<NOTE/> would clarify and simplify the method for calculating theaggregate offering price and the amount of the registration fee for FormS-8 registration statements. Currently, the aggregate offering price andthe amount of the registration fee for such offerings is computed withrespect to the aggregate contributions of employees, except that employercontributions are included if employees may choose the medium in whichthe employer's contributions are to be invested. The proposal would basethe registration fee on the aggregate offering price for the maximum amountof the registrant's securities (other than plan interests) covered by theregistration statement.\108\<NOTE/> If the offering price per share (or the option price) wereunknown, the fee would be calculated on the basis of the market price ofregistrant securities of the same class as those to be offered, as determinedin accordance with paragraph (c) of Rule 457.\109\<NOTE/> There would be no separate fee calculation for plan interests.\110\<NOTE/> A paragraph would be added to clarify that the inclusionof a reoffer prospectus on Form S-8 for employer securities issued andsold to employees under that registration statement does not result inan additional filing fee. As currently, a fee would have to be paid foradditional securities registered for resale that had been  sold to an employeein reliance on an exemption from registration.\111\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\107\ 17 CFR 230.457(h). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\108\ Proposed Rule 457(h)(1). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\109\ 17 CFR 230.457(c).

Registration of Additional Securities </ITAG>When a registrant increases the number of securities that may be issuedpursuant to an existing plan, it is required to file a new registrationstatement to cover the additional securities.\112\<NOTE/> Currently, when such a new registration statement is filed,Rule 429 \113\<NOTE/> allows the previously registered securities to be offeredand sold through the delivery of the current prospectus filed as part ofthe new registration statement. The prospectus must include all informationrequired by Form S-8 for the securities covered by both the earlier registrationstatement and the later one. Thus, a registrant can disseminate to employeesa single prospectus in connection with offerings of employee benefit plansecurities registered under several registration statements. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\112\ The Securities Act does not provide for registrationof additional securities by post-effective amendment, as provided in theInvestment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a-1, <T3>et seq.</T3>]. <T3>See</T3> current Rule 413. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\113\ 17 CFR 230.429. The procedure specified by Rule 429, which contemplates the filing of aprospectus, would not be available for registration statements on proposedForm S-8. Use of a combined prospectus would be possible, however, withoutthe Rule 429 procedure, because registrants would have the flexibilityto modify prospectuses without filing them. Proposed General InstructionE to Form S-8 would provide a procedure for the filing of a simplifiedregistration statement covering additional securities to be used in connectionwith the same employee benefit plan. The registration statement would notneed to repeat previously filed information, and could consist only ofthe facing page; a statement indicating that the contents of the earlierregistration statement, identified by file number, are incorporated byreference; the signature page; the legality opinion; \114\<NOTE/> the consents of the accountant and counsel \115\<NOTE/> and any additional required information not filed earlier.\116\<NOTE/> No prospectus would be filed, except for a reoffer prospectus,if it differed substantively from the one used in connection with the earlierregistration statement. Registrants would continue to update the Section10(a) prospectus by delivery of plan information to employees. A filingfee would be paid only with respect to the additional securities beingregistered. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\114\ Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(5)].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\115\ Item 601(b)(24) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(24)].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\116\ For example, if an exhibit not required in the earlierregistration statement was required in the later one, the latter wouldhave to include the new exhibit in Part II. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Modification of Disclosure Requirements </ITAG>The wording and arrangement of the disclosure requirements of Form S-8would be revised to reflect the basic approach underlying the proposedamendments, clarify and simplify disclosure requirements, and facilitatethe use of SPDs or plan documents to the maximum extent in furnishing planinformation to participants. Apart from editorial changes, the proposedamendments also would effect the substantive revisions discussed below.Form S-8, as proposed, would not contain the requirements called for bycurrent Items 1-3. These items require the information specified by Items501, 502 and 503 of Regulation S-K.\117\<NOTE/> This information generally is either inapplicable to employeebenefit plans or does not need to be included in a Section 10(a) prospectusstructured as an informal group of documents. The only requirement in Items1-3 proposed to be retained is that calling for the information in Item502(c), which requires the registrant to include an undertaking to provideupon request copies of documents incorporated by reference. Rather thanimplementing this requirement through an undertaking, the Commission proposesto include it among the delivery requirements mandated by proposed Rule428(b),\118\<NOTE/> and require that employees be given a written statement thatthe documents incorporated by reference are available upon request.\119\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\117\ 17 CFR 229.501, 502, 503; ``Forepart of RegistrationStatement and Outside Front Cover Page of Prospectus,'' ``Inside Frontand Outside Back Cover Pages of Prospectus,'' and ``Summary Information,Risk Factors and Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\118\ Proposed Rule 428(b)(3). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\119\ Proposed Item 2 of Form S-8.Current Items 4-13 call for plan information and would be regrouped asnew Item 1. This Item would continue to require that the essential planinformation be given to participants.\120\<NOTE/> While many of the items remain intact, the proposals deleteunnecessary requirements,\121\<NOTE/> eliminate the requirement to present information about outstandingoptions with different prices and expiration dates,\122\<NOTE/> and eliminate the need for certain disclosure regarding aspectsof ERISA plans that are substantively regulated pursuant to ERISA requirements.\123\<NOTE/> Comment is requested on whether the proposed plan informationrequirements provide sufficient information for participants to make investmentdecisions, and on whether Item 1 could be further streamlined to deleteany requirements as generally unnecessary, or as not useful for ERISA plansbecause the substantive requirements of ERISA duplicate the disclosure.Commentators also are requested to address whether it would be practicalto include the specified information in documents not specifically  tailoredto comply with these requirements, as is contemplated by the proposed scheme.Finally, the Commission requests comment on whether plan disclosure requirementsshould be much more general, with each registrant having the flexibilityto provide plan information which in its opinion is material to participantsunder the circumstances. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\120\ <T3>See</T3> Section IV.A, <T3>infra, </T3>for a chart describing the changes with particularity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\121\ <T3>E.g.,</T3> the requirements to provide the number of employee participantsand the number eligible to participate (current Item 4(d)). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\122\ Current Item 6. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\123\ Part 4 of Title I of ERISA; <T3>see</T3> n.37, <T3>supra.</T3> <T3>See</T3> current Items 11 and 12 relating to administration of theplan and investment of funds, and their analogues in proposed Items 1(h)(1),1(h)(2), 1(i)(2), and 1(i)(3), which require disclosure only for a plannot subject to ERISA. ERISA sections 103 (b) and (c) [29 U.S.C. 1023 (b)and (c)] require information in a plan annual report that is comparableto those required by these items. Currently, Item 12 of Form S-8 requires registrants to provide five-yearfinancial data in tabular form about each investment medium, if participantscan direct all or any part of the assets under a plan to two or more investmentmedia. The proposals would eliminate the specific time period of the informationbut would continue to require that registrants set forth financial datawhich, in the opinion of the registrant, would enable participants to makeinformed investment decisions concerning the investment media. The financialdata could be in tabular form or other meaningful presentation. Registrantswould be required to provide performance information in sufficient detailto apprise participants of material trends and significant changes in theperformance of alternative investment vehicles and to enable them to makemeaningful comparisons. Comment is solicited on whether it would be preferableto specify a definite time period for disclosing performance data and whatthe appropriate length of time should be, for example 5 years, 3 yearsor 2 years. Item 14 of current Form S-8 requires either a description of the securitiesbeing offered as called for by Item 202 of Regulation S-K,\124\<NOTE/> or, if such securities constitute capital stock registeredunder section 12 of the Exchange Act, that the description be incorporatedby reference from Exchange Act documents. This requirement would be movedto Part II of the proposed Form S-8, and the incorporation by referenceof the description of section 12 securities would no longer be limitedto capital stock.\125\<NOTE/> However, unless capital stock were being offered, deliveredplan documents also would be required to contain a description of the materialcharacteristics of the securities.\126\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\124\ 17 CFR 229.202. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\125\ Proposed Items 3(c) and 4 of Form S-8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\126\ Proposed Item 1(b)(2) of Form S-8.

Form S-8 would no longer require that registrants disclose to employeesthe Commission's position on indemnification for Securities Act liabilities(current Item 18), but instead would require registrants to include intheir registration statements the undertaking contained in Item 512(i)of Regulation S-K, to be redesignated as Item 512(h).\131\<NOTE/> By the terms of that undertaking, a registrant agrees tosubmit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction, in connection with any claimfor indemnification against liability under the Securities Act, the questionof whether such indemnification is against public policy under the Act.This revision would comport with the staff's current interpretive positionthat Form S-8 registrants may include the undertaking in Part II ratherthan provide the Item 18 information on indemnification in the prospectus.In addition, Form S-8 would continue to require disclosure in Part II ofthe registration statement of a registrant's policies and arrangementswith respect to the indemnification of its directors and officers (currentItem 19, proposed Item 6).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\131\ 17 CFR 229.512(i). The undertaking is proposed to berevised to indicate its applicability to Form S-8.The proposals would not modify any of the exhibit requirements for registrationstatements on Form S-8,\132\<NOTE/> but comment is solicited on whether any are unnecessary andshould be rescinded. Since Form 10-K also requires the exhibits calledfor by Item 601(b)(4) of Regulation S-K, instruments defining the rightsof security holders, and Item 601(b)(29), information furnished to stateinsurance regulatory authorities,\133\<NOTE/> comment is particularly requested on whether these exhibitsshould be retained.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\132\ <T3>See</T3> Item 601 of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601].

Reoffers and Resales </ITAG>General Instruction C to Form S-8 would be revised to clarify, and in somecases modify, the procedures for registering on that form reoffers andresales of employee benefit plan securities. Such offerings would continueto be made through a separate reoffer prospectus in customary format filedunder cover    of Form S-8 but containing the disclosure specified in PartI of Form S-3.\135\<NOTE/> Certain volume limitations would continue to apply if theregistrant did not meet the registrant requirements of Form S-3.\136\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\135\ In addition to revising General Instruction C, an amendmentis proposed to the last sentence of General lnstruction B.3 on both FormsS-3 and F-3 in order to clarify that the sentence is merely a cross-referenceto the reoffer procedure provided in Form S-8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\136\ Current General Instruction C(1)(b) and proposed GeneralInstruction C.2(b) restrict each seller, and any other person with whomhe or she is acting in concert, to the amount specified in Rule 144(e)[17 CFR 230.144(e)] during any three-month period.  Generally, current requirements for resales registered on Form S-8 wouldbe retained but clarified and restructured to make more understandablethe distinction between treatment of control securities (securities issuedunder an employee benefit plan registered on the Form S-8 to be reofferedby affiliates) \137\<NOTE/> and restricted securities \138\<NOTE/> (previously unregistered    securities issued under an employeebenefit plan pursuant to a Securities Act exemption to affiliates or non-affiliates).\139\<NOTE/> Three notable changes are proposed.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\137\ Rule 405 of Regulation C [17 CFR 230.405] defines ``affiliate''as a person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the personspecified. Generally, officers and directors of the registrant are deemedaffiliates of the registrant. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\138\ ``Restricted securities'' are defined in Rule 144(a)(3)[17 CFR 230.144(a)(3)] as securities that are acquired directly or indirectlyfrom the issuer, or from an affiliate of the issuer, in a transaction orchain of transactions not involving any public offering, or securitiesacquired from the issuer that are subject to the resale limitations ofRegulation D [17 CFR 230.501-230.506] or Rule 701(c) [17 CFR 230.701(c)]under the Securities Act, or securities that are subject to the resalelimitations of Regulation D and are acquired in a transaction or chainof transactions not involving any public offering. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\139\ In a number of no-action letters issued over the lastseveral years, the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance has takenthe position that securities issued to senior level executives participatingin ``top hat'' stock option plans would not be deemed to be restrictedsecurities. <T3>See</T3> letters re <T3>Hal Roach Studios, Inc., </T3>available Jan. 14, 1988; <T3>Lotus Development Corp., </T3>available April 6, 1987; <T3>Chi-Chi's, Inc., </T3>available Jan. 22, 1987; <T3>Electromagnetic Sciences, Inc., </T3>available May 16, 1986; <T3>Synbiotics Corporation, </T3>available Aug. 22, 1985. That positionwas incorrect because the securities issued in connection with those plansare sold to executives pursuant to section 4(2) [15 U.S.C. 77d(2)] underthe Securities Act or Regulation D thereunder. Securities issued pursuantto those provisions are defined as ``restricted securities'' in Rule 144[17 CFR 230.144]. Notwithstanding any previous position expressed by theDivision in its no-action or interpretive letters, the position set forthin this release will become effective as of the date of publication inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>with respect to all future issuances of securitiesunder such plans. First, restricted securities could be registered for reoffer in any amount,provided they have been acquired by the employee prior to the filing ofthe registration statement. Currently, General Instruction C limits theamount of restricted securities registered for resale to ten percent ofthe total number of shares issuable under the plan to which the Form S-8registration statement relates.\140\<NOTE/> The Commission believes this limitation is unnecessary, particularlyas each seller of either restricted securities or control stock would continueto be subject to Rule 144(e) volume limitations, unless the    registrantwas eligible to use Form S-3 or F-3. However, comment is solicited on whetherthe volume limitation for restricted securities should be retained, butraised above the current ten percent level to for example, 20% or 50%. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\140\ The staff currently does not object to registrationof restricted securities in an amount up to ten percent of shares issuableunder all plans whose securities are registered.Second, the proposed instruction would specifically permit registrantsto refer generically to selling security holders of control securitiesin the reoffer prospectus, provided that the names of those intending toresell were not known at the time of filing the Form S-8 registration statement.Later, as the names become known, registrants would be required to supplementthe prospectus with that information and file the supplement as requiredby Rule 424(b).\141\<NOTE/> This procedure would not be available for sellers of restrictedsecurities, since their identity should be known at the time the reoffertransaction is registered. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\141\ Currently, the Instruction states that registrants mustspecify the names of selling persons and file either a post-effective amendmentor a Rule 424(b) prospectus to add names to the reoffer prospectus. Third, General Instruction C would be revised to specify less burdensomeprocedures for reoffers by employees of foreign private issuers filingon Form 20-F. Current General Instruction E specifies that resales by employeesof such issuers may be made as described in General Instruction C exceptthat a prospectus on either Form F-2 or F-3 may be used by an issuer eligibleto use the respective form. General Instruction E would be rescinded \142\<NOTE/> and General Instruction C would be revised to  substituteForm F-3 for S-3 wherever applicable. Thus, the reoffer prospectus forsuch an offering would comply with the requirements of Form F-3, whetheror not the registrant were eligible to use that form, just as the FormS-3 prospectus is available for domestic registrants. Similarly, if theforeign private issuer were eligible to use Form F-3, reoffers could bemade without the volume limits, just as for a domestic registrant meetingthe registrant requirements of Form S-3. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\142\ <T3>See</T3> n.93 <T3>supra.</T3> E. Changes to Form 11-K The Commission is proposing to revise Form 11-K, the annual report requiredto be filed by employee benefit plans subject to Exchange Act Section 15(d)where plan interests are separate securities registered under the SecuritiesAct.\143\<NOTE/> The proposed change would revise Form 11-K to eliminate thenon-financial disclosure requirements, leaving only the requirement tofile annual plan financial statements 90 days after the close of the plan'sfiscal year. The Commission believes there is no need to require the filingof annual non-financial plan information, since updated plan informationwould be delivered to employees, as discussed above. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\143\ <T3>See </T3>n.42, <T3>supra.</T3> Currently, Form 11-K specifies the plan information, financial statementsand exhibits that must be included in annual reports for plans that aresubject to section 15(d) reporting requirements. Form S-8 requires thatreports filed on Form 11-K be incorporated by reference into the registration statement.\144\<NOTE/> Under the proposed amendments, plan annual reports, containingaudited plan financial statements, would continue to be incorporated byreference into a Form S-8 filing where plan interests are being registered.\145\<NOTE/> This requirement is being retained in order to preserve section11 liability for this ``expertized'' portion of the registration statement.In adddition, under the current and proposed rules, the plan annual reportmust be delivered to participants upon request.\146\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\144\ <T3>See</T3> n.49, <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\145\ <T3>See</T3> n.68, <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\146\ Current Item 512(f)(3) of Form S-K and proposed Rule428(b)(4). As proposed, the language of the requirement would be simplified.Current Form 11-K requirements with respect to the contents and preparationof financial statements, as well as the fiscal years to be covered, wouldbe retained.\147\<NOTE/> Form 11-K, as revised, would continue to permit the incorporationby reference into a report on that form of financial statements containedin any annual report to employees covering the latest fiscal year of theplan, provided that the statements substantially meet the requirementsof Form 11-K and the report to employees is filed as  an exhibit. Rule15d-21 would continue to allow the annual financial statements to be filedas part of a registrant's annual report on Form 10-K, or as an amendmentthereto, instead of Form 11-K.\148\<NOTE/> Such statements would have to be filed as part of the Form10-K within 120 days after the end of the plan's fiscal year. Comment isrequested on whether such period should be reduced to 90 days to conformto the filing requirements of Form 11-K.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\147\ A registrant would continue to be required to preparean audited statement of financial condition for each of the latest twofiscal years of a plan (or such lesser period as the plan has been in existence)and an audited statement of income and changes in plan equity for eachof the latest three fiscal years of the plan (or such lesser period asthe plan has been in existence). These statements would have to be preparedin accordance with the applicable provisions of Article 6A of RegulationS-X [17 CFR 210.6A-03_210.6A-05]. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\148\ Rule 15d-21 would be modified as necessary to reflectthe change to Form 11-K. A $250 fee is required with the filing of a Form11-K, but if the required disclosure is instead included as part of a reporton Form 10-K, there is no separate filing fee in addition to the $250 Form10-K filing fee. This would continue to be the case. In addition, comment is solicited on the need for retaining current requirementsfor the filing, contents and preparation of financial statements for ERISAplans. Currently, the plans filing on Form 11-K are predominantly ERISAplans, and ERISA requirements for filing plan annual reports differ fromcurrent Form 11-K requirements in two noteworthy respects. First, the filingdeadlines differ in that an ERISA plan administrator must file a plan annualreport with the Secretary of Labor within 210 days after the close of theplan year.\149\<NOTE/> Second, the time periods covered differ in that the ERISAreport regarding plans with 100 or more participants must contain an auditedbalance  sheet and an audited income statement for the last plan year.\150\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\149\ ERISA Section 104(a)(1); 29 U.S.C. 1024(a)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\150\ ERISA Section 103(b)(3) (A) and (B); 29 U.S.C. 1023(b)(3)(A) and (B). The balance sheet would need to reflect beginning and endof plan year balances. The balance sheet and income statement containedin ERISA annual reports regarding plans with less than 100 participantsneed not be audited. F. Transition to New System If the amendments to Form S-8 and related changes are adopted as proposed,any registration statement on Form S-8 would be subject to the new ruleand form requirements after the effective date of the amendments. A registrantwith an ongoing offering of securities on Form S-8 wishing to follow thenew system could revise its section 10(a) prospectus format as permitted,and would be subject to new Rule 428 and the other changes.\151\<NOTE/> No additional filing would be required unless needed to addnewly required Part II information that had not previously been filed.\152\<NOTE/> This additional information would be included in either Form8-K, which is incorporated by reference in the registration statement,or a post-effective amendment (which would not need to repeat previouslyfiled information).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\151\ <T3>See</T3> Rule 401(f)(2) [17 CFR 230.401(f)(2)].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\152\ The proposals would add one undertaking not currentlyrequired by Item 512 of Regulation S-K: The undertaking concerning indemnificationset forth in Item 512(i), to be redesignated 512(h). Many registrants nowinclude this undertaking voluntarily rather than make the correspondingdisclosure in the prospectus (current Item 18), and thus would not haveto make an addditional filing to add the undertaking.A registrant not choosing to take advantage of the new system for an ongoingoffering would nevertheless become subject to the new forms and rules whenit filed its next annual report on Form 10-K after the effective date.This filing would constitute an amendment updating the registration statementas required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and thus triggerthe requirements of Rule 401(b) \153\<NOTE/> regarding compliance with new requirements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\153\ 17 CFR 230.401(b). <ITAG tagnum="84">IV.

Cost-Benefit Analysis </ITAG>To evaluate the costs and benefits associated with the proposed rule andform changes contained in this release, the Commission requests commentatorsto provide views and data as to the costs and benefits associated withthese proposals. For the reasons set forth below, it is expected that theproposed changes to registration and reporting requirements would decreasesignificantly the time and expense incurred by reporting companies in registeringemployer securities pursuant to employee benefit plans. Furthermore, theseproposals would achieve cost savings while preserving the availabilityof information to investors and investor protection under the federal securitieslaws. The proposed amendments to Form S-8 would reduce substantially prospectuspreparation, printing and distribution costs by relying on employer communicationsto convey material information about employee benefit plans. Eliminationof requirements for filing non-financial plan information with the Commissionalso would reduce costs associated with the issuance of securities. Therelief would extend to offerings of securities issued by both ERISA andnon-ERISA plans. The proposed simplified registration form would be availableto more issuers because it would no longer require that a registrant besubject to the reporting requirements of Exchange Act Section 13 or 15(d)for 90 days prior to filing a Form S-8 registration statement. Its usealso would be expanded because offerings pursuant to compensatory contracts,and to consultants and advisors, could be included under specified conditions.The proposals to make Form S-8 registration statements effective upon filing,to simplify the method of calculating filing fees, and simplify the proceduresfor the registration of additional securities and plan interests shouldfurther alleviate costs and burdens associated with the registration process.Finally, the proposed amendment of Form 11-K to eliminate the requirementfor non-financial plan information would reduce substantially the costsof complying with reporting obligations of plans that are subject to ExchangeAct Section 15(d). <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in accordance with 5 U.S.C.603 has been prepared concerning the proposed amendments to Forms S-8,S-3, F-3 and 11-K, and the related new rules and rule amendments. The analysisnotes that the proposed rule and form changes relating to employee benefitplans are intended to expedite the filing, effectiveness and updating ofForm S-8 registration statements and to reduce Exchange Act reporting obligations.As discussed more fully in the analysis, the proposed changes would affectpersons that are small entities, as defined by the Commission's rules.It is expected that the overall effect of the proposed amendments wouldbe to decrease significantly the impact of reporting, recordkeeping, andcompliance requirements upon registrants and plans registering securitieson Form S-8. As the analysis indicates, several possible significant alternativesto the proposals were considered, including, among others, establishingdifferent compliance or reporting requirements for small entities or exemptingthem from all or part of the proposed requirements. As more fully discussedin the analysis, implementing any of the alternatives would be either duplicativeof the proposed changes or not consistent with the purposes of the SecuritiesAct. Comments are encouraged on any aspect of the analysis. A copy of the analysismay be obtained by contacting Larisa Dobriansky or Elizabeth Murphy, Officeof Disclosure Policy, Division of Corporation Finance, at (202) 272-2589,Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington,DC 20549. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII.

Commentatorsare requested to address the proposed changes both from the perspectiveof the registrant and that of the plan participants. The Commission alsorequests comment on whether the proposals, if adopted, would have an adverseeffect on competition that is neither necessary nor appropriate in furtheringthe purposes of the Exchange Act.
