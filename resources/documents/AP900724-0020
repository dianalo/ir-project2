The report, released by NASA on Monday after a request by TheAssociated Press, said officials selected Perkin-Elmer Corp. ofDanbury, Conn., to make the Hubble optical assembly, even thoughthe company planned to use an unproven computer-driven system inthe critical mirror polishing.   Engineers for the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationnow believe that a flaw manufactured into one of the mirrors byPerkin-Elmer blurred the vision of the Hubble telescope, reducingits effectiveness by at least 50 percent. The error is now underinvestigation.   The report, signed on Aug. 26, 1977 by then-NASA AdministratorRobert A. Frosch, said the bid by Perkin-Elmer, now Hughes DanburyOptical Systems Inc., was preferred over a bid by Eastman Kodak Co.for several reasons, including cost.   Officials evaluating the two contract bids rated Perkin-Elmer as``very good'' and Kodak as ``good.''   ``Our only concern about the Perkin-Elmer approach centersaround their plan to utilize an as-yet unverifiedcomputer-controlled mirror polishing technique,'' the report said.   It noted, however, that the concern was ``alleviated'' becausethe selection board knew that Perkin-Elmer had ``other proven andreliable techniques'' that could be used ``in the event that theircomputer technique is not perfected and verified in time for use onthe OTA (optical telescope assembly) program.   ``Based upon this information, we believe Perkin-Elmer has theability to successfully polish the primary mirror,'' the reportadded.   The report was cosigned by A.M. Lovelace, deputy NASAadministrator, and John E. Naugle, NASA associate administrator.   One weakness in the Perkin-Elmer proposal, the report said, wasthe firm's ``unsubstantiated accuracy of focus sensor testequipment.''   This equipment is among the items impounded by a NASA committeethat is investigating the manufacture of the Hubble mirrors. Thatpanel, led by Lew Allen, director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,is to meet at the manufacturer's offices in Danbury on Wednesday.   Perkin-Elmer sold its optical division to Hughes Aircraft Co.and the company is now known as Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc.Officials at Hughes Danbury either declined to be interviewed aboutthe NASA report or could not be reached by telephone.   In their 1977 report, the NASA officials said ``the single mostsignificant technical discriminator'' that tilted the selection toPerkin-Elmer was the approach used by the Connecticut company inmaking a fine guidance sensor, the device that is used to aim thetelescope. It said the Perkin-Elmer approach was a ``costeffective'' design.   The officials also noted that they were ``quite surprised at thelarge difference in cost favoring Perkin-Elmer'' in the bids. Theysaid the Kodak proposal on the fine guidance system was three timesmore costly than that of Perkin-Elmer.   Perkin-Elmer was given the Hubble contract at about $62 million,but overruns drove the actual cost up to $451 million by the timethe telescope was launched from a space shuttle on April 25.   NASA officials concluded in the report that Perkin-Elmer``clearly won the competition'' based on ``mission suitability''and because the Connecticut firm would be ``the lowest costproducer.''</TEXT></DOC>
