His attorney hinted strongly that Pierce would againrefuse to testify.   Pierce, who has been subpoenaed to appear on Friday, invoked hisright to ban television and radio coverage of the testimony duringa meeting between his attorneys and the subcommittee staff.   Meanwhile, U.S. District Court Judge Joyce Green denied arequest by the four major television networks for a permanentinjunction that would keep the clerk of the House from enforcingthe rule permitting a witness to ban broadcast coverage.   The subcommittee on employment and housing of the GovernmentOperations Committee is investigating alleged fraud,influence-peddling and mismanagement during Pierce's eight-yeartenure. Last month he invoked his Fifth Amendment right againstself-incrimination and refused to testify, contending thesubcommittee members had prejudged him.   In an interview Wednesday night, Pierce's attorney, Paul L.Perito, said a decision on whether Pierce would testify Fridaywould not be made until Thursday morning. But he said he had seenlittle evidence that the subcommittee's attitude toward the formersecretary had changed.   ``I am still convinced that these people have prejudged myclient without merit and we have certainly not foreclosed acontinuation of the option we invoked at the previous hearing,''Perito said.   Stuart Weisberg, counsel for the subcommittee, declined commenton the substance of the meeting except to confirm that Pierce'sattorneys had renewed their request that television and stillcameras and radio coverage be prohibited.   ``It was a cordial and frank discussion,'' Weisberg said.   Another congressional source, however, said that Pierce'sattorneys asked whether the subcommittee would require his presencein the event he would again refuse to testify and were told thatsubcommittee chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., would insist thatPierce personally appear.   Another subcommittee member, however, said he thought it wouldbe a waste of time to hold a hearing if Pierce, the only scheduledwitness, was not going to testify. ``I'm not sure it's worth uswasting our time to hear him tell us'' he won't testify, said Rep.Christopher Shays, R-Conn.   ``I don't think Sam Pierce could tell us very much anyway.''   Pierce appeared voluntarily before the panel in May and said hetook no direct role in decisions about what projects to finance,asking only that projects supported by prominent Republicansreceive ``careful consideration.'' That appearance was covered live.   Since then, however, a former Pierce deputy and documentsreleased by the agency have indicated that Pierce played a greaterrole in some such decisions involving friends and politicalassociates.   In addition to Pierce, three other former top HUD officials,including two who served as his top aides, have refused to testifyon grounds that their testimony might tend to incriminate them.   The judge dismissed the suit filed by Cable News Network Inc.,Capital Cities-ABC Inc., CBS Inc., and National Broadcasting Co.Inc.   The networks, in alleging a violation of the First Amendment,contended that the House may not arbitrarily delegate to a privateparty the right to determine whether TV coverage of Pierce'sappearances will be allowed.   Green ruled, however, that judicial review of the question isbarred by the Constitution. She said the House rule is within thelegitimate legislative sphere and is essential to legislating.   The judge said the TV networks ``have chosen the wrong forum inwhich to present their objection. Their recourse lies not with thecourts, but rather with the co-equal branch of government'' thatenacted the rule.</TEXT></DOC>
