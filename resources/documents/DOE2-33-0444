<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-33-0444 </DOCNO><TEXT>We describe a new high-rate detector suitable for X-ray imaging, ringimaging of Cherenkov light, and charged-particle tracking. The deviceis a parallel-plate avalanche chamber coupled to a gated drift-chamberreadout. This design incorporates the advantages of parallel-plate avalanchechambers and drift-chamber readout methods, and avoids some of the disadvantagesof both. The two-dimensional readout of the detection plate is obtainedby time slicing in one dimension and cathode pads in the other.</TEXT></DOC>
