The No. 1 rental company said it expects to raise rates across the board between 6% and 7% on Sept. 1. The increases would mean an average $3 to $4 more a day for commercial customers and $10 to $15 more a week for leisure renters. A Ford Tempo that now rents for $170 a week, for example, would cost $180 to $190 after the changes.    &quot;We haven't had this kind of an increase in at least five years,&quot; said Craig R. Koch, president of Hertz's North America Rent A Car Division. &quot;Our industry is just badly behind in passing through inflation&quot; represented by higher costs for cars, licenses and titles, insurance, wages, facilities and advertising.    Other rental-car companies said they are studying the Hertz move closely. &quot;We applaud their bravado,&quot; said Terry Redmond, executive vice president of National Car Rental System Inc. of Minneapolis. &quot;We hope they stick with it. If anything can help and we can get our prices to better reflect our costs, we're happy.&quot;    That sentiment was echoed at Budget Rent a Car Corp. &quot;We believe this may signal an industry trend,&quot; said Robert A. Wilson, vice president of marketing planning. &quot;There is obviously a need for more revenue for the industry and unfortunately we're going to have to get it from our customers.&quot;    Closely held Hertz said the expectation of sharply higher new-car prices this fall was a major factor in its decision. Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have told their dealers that prices on most 1990 models could go up as much as 7% to 9% from 1989 levels, largely because of new safety equipment required by federal law. &quot;Car-cost increases of that magnitude simply cannot go unaccounted for,&quot; Mr. Koch said, adding that Hertz didn't raise its overall rates last fall when car prices increased.    But competitors pointed to other reasons why Hertz might need to jack up rates. Industry sources said the firm has lost some 10 points in market share over the past five years. In addition, fewer people flew domestic airlines during the first half of 1989 than a year earlier, and Hertz depends heavily on airport customers.    Still, Hertz isn't the only company feeling the pinch. In recent weeks, a number of rental concerns have raised prices to vacationers by about 5% to 10%. In some cities, increases were higher.    Business travelers were unaffected by these changes, but they aren't being left out in what is developing into a new round of increases. National's Mr. Redmond said it raised the guidelines by which its sales staff sells commercial rates by $4 a day effective Aug. 1.    Commercial rates go up as corporate contracts are renewed.    Moves such as this could be &quot;extremely significant&quot; for everyone concerned, said Charles H. Finnie, an analyst with Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc., an investment banking firm in Baltimore. There is tremendous pressure to keep down commercial rates, he says, adding that &quot;companies have been willing to squeeze margins to almost nothing to get that business.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
