Signe Landgren of the Stockholm International Peace ResearchInstitute said the embargo hindered, but could not stop, the growthof South Africa's power.   The United Nations imposed a voluntary arms embargo Aug. 7,1963, which was made mandatory in 1977. Restrictions were furthertightened in a 1984 resolution urging countries to boycott SouthAfrican arms exports.   The embargo was defeated for many years through cheating orexploiting legal loopholes, said Ms. Landgren, whose book ``EmbargoDisimplemented'' was published Wednesday.   ``All South Africa's military technology was imported from thevery same nations which took part in the embargo,'' she said at aseminar on her book.   ``The general conclusion can be one of a long history offailure. That's correct if you look at each individual sale,'' shesaid. ``But I see very visible effects of this embargo.''   She cited South Africa's refusal to deploy Mirage aircraft inAngola last year for fear of losing any to anti-aircraft missiles.Equipment problems could have been ``a contributing factor to thedecision to withdraw from Angola and Namibia,'' she said.   The study argues that no matter how inefficient, the embargoremains one of the few military sanctions that can be imposed onSouth Africa and is valuable as a political statement condemningthe country's apartheid system of racial segregation.   Ms. Landgren also said that a growing interdependence indeveloping new technologies and greater adherence to the embargoare factors making Pretoria increasingly vulnerable to thesanctions.   ``South Africa is more and more isolated,'' she said, notingthat Israel, one of its stronger allies in recent years, haddistanced itself from Pretoria.   ``It is left completely in the hands of private smugglers, withall that that implies in terms of insecurity,'' said Ms. Landgren.   In the latest example, French police last weekend broke up analleged plot by Protestant extremists from Northern Ireland to handover to a South African diplomat parts of a stolen British-madeBlowpipe shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile.   Last year, West German authorities uncovered an attempt tosmuggle submarine blueprints to South Africa, which has announcedplans to build its own submarine by 1992.   Ms. Landgren estimated that buying smuggled weaponry on theblack market and pirating their design cost the South Africansthree or four times the normal price.   As a member of the British Commonwealth, South Africa in the1950s had state-of-the-art equipment. Britain and the United Statesstopped their open sales of equipment after the first embargo.   ``The West Europeans fell all over each other to conquer a partof this lucrative market,'' said Ms. Landgren.   ``After the Europeans came Japan and Israel. It is pointless tolook for one scapegoat. We are all part of the South Africanmarket,'' she said.   South Africa launched an arms manufacturing program by 1961, andthe embargo ``was a belated attempt to stop a development whichalready had begun,'' she said.   In the book, Ms. Landgren said the ban had the countereffect ofspurring the South Africans to further develop their arms industry.But it also deprived Pretoria of modernized weapons systems,restricted its access to technology and curtailed the supply ofspare parts.   Smuggling operations are hidden by creating dummy companies,using phony labeling, diverting shipments to new destinations atsea or in midflight, and forging end-user certificates, the booksays.   But legal avenues were more important for building up theindustry, it says.   By the time the embargo took effect, South African had 120foreign licenses to produce weapons. Before the arms ban becameobligatory 14 yeas later, the Armaments Corp. of South Africa(Armscor) was legally producing weapons systems like the FrenchMirage jetfighter and the Israeli Reshef gunboat armed with theScorpion sea missile.   The embargo also is circumvented legally by importing civilianproducts which have military applications, such as electronics andtelecommunications gear, the study says.</TEXT></DOC>
