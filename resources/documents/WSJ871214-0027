Yet later in the evening, Hisham M. Nazer, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, asserted &quot;there are no locked talks.&quot;    This much was clear: all of the 13 member countries except for the warring nations of Iran and Iraq had approved an agreement that essentially maintains current production quotas and that preserves OPEC's benchmark price of $18 a barrel. By tonight, most of the ministers believe, they will conclude an agreement -- but one that excludes Iraq or Iran, or both.    &quot;I am outside the agreement,&quot; said Iraq's Oil Minister Issam Abdul Raheemm Al-Chalabi, who, despite the strong backing of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, failed in an effort to obtain a production quota equal to Iran's. &quot;But,&quot; the Iraqi minister added, &quot;a twelve-member agreement is better than an eleven-member agreement.&quot;    But Iran's participation in the agreement has also been questionable ever since its delegation failed to secure the price increase of a least $2 a barrel that it was sent here to obtain. After a day of renewed bickering over an agreement that was all but completed Saturday night, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, last night threatened to fly back to Tehran for consultations with his government.    &quot;There are some problems to be solved,&quot; said an official close to the Iranian minister. &quot;Our departure tomorrow morning depends on the outcome of these things.&quot; Added an oil minister from another country, by late today, &quot;we will have an agreement of either eleven or twelve.&quot;    The compromise agreement that was left hanging last night would essentially do nothing to curb excessive OPEC production in the face of brimming oil inventories and uncertain world-wide petroleum demand for the first half of next year. OPEC's production ceiling would total 15.1 million barrels a day for the half. That is identical to OPEC's current ceiling of 16.6 million barrels a day, after subtracting Iraq's quota of 1.5 million barrels a day -- a limit that the war-torn nation has openly flouted.    Confusion has been unusually high at this meeting, with delegates issuing misleading statements and alliances shifting from day to day and even hour to hour.    At the start of the meeting last Wednesday it appeared that the Arab powerhouses of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait had the meeting well in hand, with Iran the odd man out. The Arab gulf faction was intent on preserving OPEC's $18-a-barrel benchmark for another year. It also was proposing to increase OPEC's ceiling to 17.5 million barrels a day from the current 16.6 million. By their arithmetic this would actually trim OPEC production mainly because Iraq, which is producing nearly twice its quota, had promised to cut back if it were given an official allotment equal to Iran's 2.4 million barrels a day. OPEC's total output, despite the ceiling, is currently about 18.5 million barrels a day.    But by Friday, a remarkable turn of events had put Iran back into the picture. The change came about because some non-Arab countries weren't pleased by what they considered the major Arab producers' heavy-handed tactics. Several countries, including influential Venezuela, began questioning the huge 800,000 barrel-a-day quota increase proposed for Iraq. As they saw it, Saudi Arabia was merely trying to punish Iran, and to make good on public assurances by King Fahd that oil prices would remain at $18 a barrel for another year.    At the same time, these non-gulf nations grew more sympathetic to Iran, which doesn't even produce what its quota allows and was leading the charge for a price increase -- something that would help poor nations increase their revenue.    As a result, Iraq, in effect, bowed out. &quot;It's a pity,&quot; said Mr. Al-Chalabi. &quot;I've got my pen ready, but they don't like my signature.&quot; Arab officials were shocked by the changing tide. &quot;Politics sabotaged this meeting,&quot; said one Arab delegate.    The momentum of the new turn of events accelerated Saturday. By that evening a new agreement excluding Iraq was all but completed. Under that plan, the $18 a barrel benchmark would be maintained and the remaining dozen nations would abide by quotas totaling 15.1 million barrels a day -- simply a &quot;rollover&quot; of the current total minus Iraq's quota.    But early yesterday morning the proposed benchmark resurfaced as an issue. The hitch involved Iran's demand for a clause in the agreement compelling a review of the price at mid-year, by which time today's huge oil inventories would be diminished. But Saudi Arabia opposed locking in the price for anything short of a year.    Throughout the meeting, the Arab faction and the Iranians weren't talking to each other. So for most of yesterday the oil ministers of Venezuela, Indonesia and Nigeria -- dubbed &quot;the three wise men&quot; -- continued functioning as intermediaries shuttling between the Marriott Hotel, where the Saudi and Kuwaiti delegations were quartered, and the Intercontinental Hotel, the base for the Iranians. At one point the shuttle mission derailed when the &quot;wise men&quot; arrived at the Intercontinental only to find that the Iranians had just departed for their embassy here.    Yesterday afternoon, Fernando Santos-Alvite, the oil minister of Equador, finally announced:&quot;There is a draft agreement.&quot; Yet talks seemed to collapse again last night with the Iranians balking anew. Reports swept the hotel lobbies that Iran, Gabon and perhaps others were suddenly seeking to reduce the ceiling to defend the benchmark price.    &quot;We realized that the ceiling wasn't credible for the market,&quot; Gabon said. &quot;Therefore, we need to start from zero and try to find the level&quot; below estimates of demand for OPEC oil.    Before long, the Iranians made it clear they were preparing for a possible early morning departure by their minister for Tehran. But late last night, according to a delegate from a neutral government, &quot;in principle he agreed&quot; to the latest price and production pact and indicated that he would assent by telephone. Added Subroto, the oil minister of Indonesia, in an interview: &quot;There are still some little things to be straightened out.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
