It appeared in this newspaper on Jan. 21, 1976, and made a bold prediction. It claimed that by the time the baby is out of the 8th grade, America will be out of oil and gas.    The text reads: &quot;It's fact. The latest U.S. Government figures indicate our proven reserves will only last {12 years.} . . . . These frightening numbers reveal our energy problem. And the solution.&quot; The ad goes on to tout the advantages of coal, but the part that amazed me was the claim that we could ever run out of oil or gas.    I saved this ad and have been badgering my students with it ever since. More than 4,000 students have been asked to remember the infamous date, 12 years from Jan. 21, 1976.    Well class, that day has come and gone. Go on and look out a window. Do you see cars moving along highways? Are your lights working? Do you have heat? Is there gasoline in your car? I bet so.    We are, of course, not out of oil or gas, nor was there ever any danger that we would be. In fact, many now claim there is an oil glut and that we desperately need restrictive tariffs and quotas to protect domestic producers.    This ad was only one of many claiming imminent crisis. How could these predictions have been so wrong? Did our leaders save us? Was there a new government program reflecting their wisdom and foresightedness? No, my recollection is that government just continued in the general chaotic state that it has always followed.    In fact, the predictions weren't really out of the ordinary. There has been a long history of government studies predicting imminent depletion of oil and gas. Way back in 1917, the Interior Department reported that only 27 years of oil remained. Three years later the U.S. Geological Survey reported only four years were left. By 1924, somehow additional oil was available for six more years. In 1975, 51 years later, the prediction stood at 12 years for oil and gas. Current predictions are less bold, restricted to proven reserves, but generally say only 12 years of natural gas and eight years of oil remain.    Hardly anyone pays attention to these predictions nowdays. Why not? Because world oil and gas supply is not like a giant pool, with world demand a big straw sucking up the energy until suddenly the pool is dry. Instead, some oil lies deep in the ground while some practically bubbles up. Other oil lies under the north slopes of Alaska or the frozen tundra of Siberia. Some is deep beneath the ocean. Some is even chemically bonded into shale rock. There's no telling where else we may be able to drill and find oil in the future, or whether we'll develop substitutes that will drive petroleum to a fate similar to that of whale oil.    We can never run out of oil or gas in the sense that one day it is available and the next day it is gone. Should we ever approach the limits of this type of energy, its price will simply rise and less-valued uses for it will be lost to the competition.    Only a few years ago people were genuinely in a panic. Can you remember the National Guard entering homes and businesses to make sure thermostats were not set too high? Or the public-service commercial in which a young mother and her baby are traveling down an interstate highway when suddenly she runs out of gas? After pulling over onto the grass she discovers there are no other cars on the road. A somber voice explains that the last gallon of gas has just been used. Then the scene changes to a bustling factory when suddenly the lights flicker and finally go dark. Again, the voice informs us that now all energy sources have been depleted.    What was the &quot;public service&quot; in these messages? That we are all doomed? That soon we will wake up and find all our energy gone? Well, I'm awake. The day is here. Where is the crisis?    Predictions are frustrating because you need a time machine to test them, but with patience we have a time machine of sorts. We can wait. The only problem with waiting is that most of us need someone to remind us when we arrive. Well, class, welcome to the future. Are you surprised at what you find? I hope not.    ---   Mr. Hite teaches economics at The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina. </TEXT></DOC>
