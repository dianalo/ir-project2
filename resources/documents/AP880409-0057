Although the price depression is costing OPEC at least $35million a day, most of the ministers feel that further cuts in OPECproduction will not help, said cartel sources, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   They said the ministers instead would likely renew a call forproduction restraint by independent oil producing nations suchMexico and China.   The ministers were not empowered to make OPEC policy decisions,but they hoped to recommend to their cartel partners on what, ifany, action should be taken at the next full OPEC conference, setfor June.   Those attending the closed-door meeting represented SaudiArabia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Indonesia and Algeria and reflected across-section of views within the organization.   Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, the oil minister of Venezuela, toldreporters no decisions had been made.   Some analysts believe that if OPEC decides not to reduce itsproduction further, oil prices will fall in coming weeks because ofa global glut.   Pierre Terzian, editor of Petrostrategies, an oil tradepublication, said today in Vienna that he thought OPEC inactionwould drive the price down by as much as $1.50 a barrel, to about$14 a barrel for top-grade crudes.   On Friday, world oil markets were calm. The price of Brent crudefrom the North Sea traded in London for May delivery at $15.60 abarrel, down 10 cents from Thursday.   ``There's a high degree of skepticism (among traders) regardingthe outcome of this meeting,'' said Peter Gignoux, an analyst inLondon for the investment firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers.   The talks by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesopened amid renewed signs that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's mostinfluential member, was growing impatient with the failure of somemembers to strictly abide by the cartel's rules.   King Fahd was quoted Friday by the official Saudi press agencyas saying he regretted that some OPEC members, whom he did notidentify, were unsettling the oil market by offering pricediscounts in violation of OPEC statutes.   Fahd was said to have denied recent reports that his kingdom wasoffering price discounts to some customers.   The Venezuelan oil minister, Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, said itshould be viewed as a routine session of the cartel'sprice-monitoring committee, which is authorized to meet wheneveroil prices fall substantially below OPEC's target of $18.   It was the first meeting of the committee since last December'sfull OPEC conference in which the cartel decided to maintain _ atleast through June _ its existing oil production quotas for allmembers except Iraq.   The Iraqis have refused to cooperate in limiting output.   Analysts say OPEC has been producing near its 12-nationproduction ceiling of 15.06 million barrels a day. Pricesnonetheless have dropped to between $15 and $16 a barrel.   With OPEC's production, including that of Iraq, apparentlyrunning at between 17.5 million and 18 million barrels daily, theprice decline is costing OPEC as a group at least $35 million a day.</TEXT></DOC>
