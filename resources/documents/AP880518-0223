Representatives of about 500 model communes across the countryattended the opening of the congress in the capital, Phnom Penh, onMonday, the official Communist Party newspaper Pracheachon said.   The paper said while the Cambodian government has made advances,guerrillas were conducting psychological warfare along the Thaiborder area ``with impunity.''   The paper said the party's ruling Politburo ``considers thelocalities as a matter of life or death to the revolution ... asthe core battlefield, and the work of building and consolidatinglocalities, villages, communes, units and army bases as the keytask in 1988.''   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978, ousting the Khmer Rougerulers. The communist Khmer Rouge now forms the largest of threeguerrilla groups.   Pracheachon said the guerrillas were moving into the interior ofthe country to spread propaganda against the government andencourage criticism of Vietnam. It said the rebels were plantingagents and preparing for 1990, when Vietnam has said it willwithdraw the last of its troops from Cambodia.   The Cambodian government is trying to lure guerrillas and theirsupporters back to the fold with promises of amnesty, jobs andrewards.   However, the paper said, ``the enemy is still able to conducthis activities at a number of remote villages and communes alongthe Cambodian-Thai border, frequently making unchecked entriesinto, exits from, and passages through these localities andintimidating the local people with impunity.''   A text of the paper's editorial was obtained from a Westernembassy in Bangkok on Wednesday.   Cambodians are torn between deep-seated enmity for Vietnam andfor the Khmer Rouge, which massacred hundreds of thousands ofpeople during its nearly four-year rule.   On May 10, Khmer Rouge radio claimed that guerrillas smashed theVietnamese administrative network in more than 4,000 villages and200 communes during the seven-month dry season that ended in April.   Vietnam was forced to transfer important units from theThai-Cambodian border to the interior to defend against attacks, itclaimed.   However, Khmer Rouge claims are widely regarded as exaggerated.</TEXT></DOC>
