The Brazilian government also denied allegations of unfair tradepractices and a top presidential aide in Brasilia said the nationwould present ``solid arguments in its defense.''   The Bush administration on Thursday listed countries with tradebarriers most harmful to American producers, as required by the1988 Omnibus Trade Act. The government has 18 months to negotiateaway the barriers and failure of the talks could lead to tariffs ofup to 100 percent on selected exports from the offenders.   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno summoned U.S. Ambassador MichaelArmacost to deliver a protest in Tokyo and the government saidthere were errors in U.S. complaints about alleged barriers tosales of supercomputers, satellites and forest products in Japan.   Uno and other Cabinet ministers said the U.S. action was``extremely regrettable'' and officials indicated Japan wouldrefuse to participate in talks sought by the United States to endthe alleged practices.   ``This designation in no way possesses legal binding force inthe international trade system,'' said Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, ministerof international trade and industry.   India was cited for barriers against foreign investment and theclosing of its insurance market to foreign companies. Theadministration cited Brazil for quotas on imports and licensingrestrictions.   ``We regard this law and action under it as totally unjustified,irrational and unfair,'' India's Commerce Minister Dinesh Singhsaid in New Delhi.   ``The United States' action is particularly surprising becausethe U.S. Itself has built and retained a variety of barriersagainst access to its markets,'' Singh said. ``It is hardly in aposition to ask others to lift barriers without doing so itself.''   In Brasilia, Ronaldo Costa Couto, the chief of staff ofPresident Jose Sarney, said in a radio interview that Sarney was``concerned'' about the U.S. decision but said, ``Brazil has solidarguments in its defense.''   All three nations have trade surpluses with the United States,led by Japan's $52 billion surplus. India had a $700 millionsurplus with the United States in 1988, while the most recentfigures available from Brazil indicate that nation's U.S. exportstotaled $8.54 billion last year and U.S. imports in the first 11months of 1988 totaled $2.74 billion.   Last year, U.S. exports to Japan rose 33.7 percent to $37.7billion and the bilateral trade deficit shrank by $4.4 billion,according to U.S. statistics. But Japanese exports surged thisyear, increasing political pressure for Washington to take actionunder the trade law.   Mitsuzuka described U.S. trade policy as ``to threaten othercountries into negotiating by brandishing the threat of unilateralsanctions.''   He said the policy was contrary to the principles of themultinational General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, andcould undermine the existing multilateral free trade system andongoing Uruguay Round of GATT.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said Japan would agreeto ``quiet talks'' that might coincide with U.S. demands under the1988 trade law. He also said Japan might complain to GATT if theUnited States imposed sanctions.   Japan has taken steps to open its markets, Uno said, denyingthat the specific U.S. complaints ``can be considered to constitutetrade barriers.''   ``I strongly regret the lack of fairness because the UnitedStates has unilaterally made such a decision...despite the factthat the U.S. itself maintains import-restrictive measures andpractices to a considerable degree,'' Uno said.   Takuma Yamamoto, president of supercomputer maker Fujitsu Ltd.,said the computer market in Japan ``has been totally freed'' andthe government policy on buying supercomputers _ contrary to theU.S. complaint _ is not to discriminate between foreign anddomestic producers.   He said U.S. supercomputers have 15 percent of the Japanesemarket while Japanese supercomputers have only 2 percent of theU.S. market. No Japanese supercomputer ever has been bought by aU.S. public organization, Yamamoto said.   The government also said sales of U.S. forestry products inJapan had doubled from 1986 to 1988, and the minister of posts andtelecommunications, Seiichi Kataoka, noted Japan was buying fiveAmerican satellites this year.   India last year exported about $3.2 billion worth of goods tothe United States, it's biggest trading partner, primarilyclothing, diamonds, crude oil and cashews.   Anwarul Hoda, joint secretary in the Commerce Ministry, saidIndia's trade surplus with the United States only started in 1983and had dropped sharply from $1 billion in 1987 to $700 million in1988.</TEXT></DOC>
