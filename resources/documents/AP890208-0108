And if (President) Bush defends Tower strongly now, that will bea tip that it's time to watch more closely what the president does,and not to just read his lips.   This simply isn't the time for a John Tower-type in that job.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 1   Times-Union, Albany N.Y., on the John Tower nomination:   The president of the United States has traditionally, andrightly, been permitted to appoint his cabinet pretty much as he hasseen fit. The president, after all, has to appoint men and womenwhom he knows and with whom he can work closely.   In that sense, John Tower, the defense secretary-designate,should be approved by the Senate. ...   President Bush ... has chosen for defense secretary a man whosejob resume raises numerous questions about potential conflicts ofinterest.   Since retiring from the Senate, where he served on a majordefense committee, ... Tower has managed to become perhaps thepremier defense lobbyist in the country. Last year he earned nearlythree-quarters of a million dollars from half a dozen of thenation's largest defense contractors. Now he is about to become themost important Defense Department buyer. ...   There is nothing to suggest that ... Tower is anything butupright and honest. The issue is neither his character nor hiscompetence, but the high criteria ... Bush has vowed to establishfor public servants.   Just what are those criteria, and is there a tension between whatthe president says and what he does? If so, it should be ironed out.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 3   The Indianapolis Star on Black History Month:   The world of entertainment and the world of sports would be bleakindeed without their black American stars and superstars.   But below the spectacular highlands of fame and glory, blackfamilies and individuals working in everyday jobs made theircontributions to the building of America.   Much that goes into the making of a nation is far from glamorous,but even though it is obscure, it is necessary, it is part of thebig picture, it is elemental in the weave of life.   This is Black History Month, which is dedicated to wideningknowledge and deepening understanding of the role of blacks inAmerican life.   If you do not know anything about Countee Cullen, Edward Bouchet,Jupiter Hammon, James Weldon Johnson, Gen. Daniel James Jr.,Langston Hughes, Lorraine Hansberry, Gwendolyn Brooks, HarrietTubman, Sojourner Truth, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, August Wilson,Peter Salem, Pedro Alonzo Nino, Dr. Carter G. Woodson and RosaParks, it is high time you did.   And that is only the beginning.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 4   The New Mexican, Santa Fe, N.M., on border ditch and fenceproposals:   Proposals to spend millions of dollars to build ditches andfences along the U.S-Mexico border are neither new nor wise.   Last month, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Serviceproposed a four-mile ditch near San Diego to stop vehicles fromcrossing illegally along that section of the international border.The price tag of the 14-foot-wide, 5-foot-deep ditch would be about$2 million.   Associate Attorney General Francs A. Keating II compared it to a``buried Berlin Wall.'' Mexico City newspapers called it the ``ChileCurtain.''   Next, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a privateimmigration reform group, proposed that the government build 10miles of 12-foot concrete bunkers topped with 8-foot wire fences onthe border at El Paso, Texas. That would cost millions more,although no estimate was given.   It would be a waste of taxpayers' money to turn these plans intoconcrete and posts and wire _ obstacles that are unlikely to reducethe flow of illegal immigrants or drug trafficking in anysignificant fashion.   They serve only to cause more hard feelings along the border andbetween the governments of the two countries.</TEXT><NOTE>End Editorial Rdp</NOTE></DOC>
