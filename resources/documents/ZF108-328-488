(products).andO;Product:   Back and Forth (Utility program).andO;Topic:     Utility ProgramsMultitaskingEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Progressive Solutions Inc.andM;BACK andamp; FORTH 1.00andM;Back andamp; Forth is proof that shareware doesn't have to be amateurish.andP;  Theprogram is professional, but still carries a modest price of $50.andP;  Buyers canorder the program disk and documentation through a toll-free number, or candownload both from on-line services or bulletin boards.andM;Back andamp; Forth consumes the least amount of memory of the products in thisgroup: 17K bytes, 3.4K bytes of which goes for a second copy of COMMAND.COM.andM;In the task-switching test, the program took a moderate 8 seconds to changefrom 1-2-3 to WordPerfect.andP;  It supports only nine partitions but that shouldbe enough for most users.andP;  In version 1.10, released too late for full reviewhere, the number of partitions was increased to 20.andP;  The new version debutedlate in March.andM;Back andamp; Forth can swap applications to LIM EMS 4.0 or 3.2 expanded memory orto disk, but not directly to extended memory.andP;  Users can, however, define avirtual disk in extended memory and swap to that disk.andP;  Users can control thetype and size of swap area for each partition.andM;Back andamp; Forth automatically changes its swap area from expanded memory to diskwhen the expanded memory is full.andM;Its configuration program is the smoothest and easiest to use of the group.andO;It displays an on-screen picture of the keyboard, for example, to help usersdefine partition hot keys.andP;  Press a key, and the program highlights itson-screen counterpart.andM;The product even includes a built-in tree facility that lets users scan adisk's directories when the program asks for a file name.andP;  A bug preventedthis facility from correctly handling files on a Novell NetWare server, but aquick check of version 1.10 showed the bug has been fixed.andM;Back andamp; Forth's 68-page, laser-printed documentation is well-written, and agood on-line help facility assists users further.andM;Progressive Solutions Inc., of San Antonio, Texas, can be contacted at (800)833-4400 or (512) 670-1061.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;User-configurable options, a small kernel and intelligent management ofmemory resources are the reasons Ted de Castro, a health physicist at theUniversity of California's Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, chose Back andamp; Forth.andM;The main requirement, he said, was to be able to drop out to a DOS partitionfrom his communications software, which was running on a PC linked to amainframe.andP;  He also wanted to retain the use of as much RAM as possible oncehe dropped out to DOS.andP;  &quot;With any task switcher, how it works withcommunications software is very iffy,&quot; de Castro said.andP;  &quot;Back andamp; Forth handlesthis fine and makes it easy by not hanging up [on the mainframe] and notreinitializing the serial port.&quot;andM;As a systems operator on the PC Link bulletin board run by Quantum Corp. andTandy Corp., de Castro has to jump out of his mainframe applications to takecare of PC on-line business.andP;  Back andamp; Forth lets him drop out of an EGAgraphics screen without garbling or freezing the screen.andM;&quot;I like the way it deals with the partitions,&quot; said de Castro.andP;  &quot;It reservesspace in EMS, [extended] RAM and the hard disk, and it will take them in thatorder so you have the fastest swapping possible.&quot;andM;Back andamp; Forth took 10 minutes to install, he said, adding that the programallowed him to choose the subdirectory where the kernel would reside, specifywhere to set up swap space and indicate how much swap space to use.andM;Andrew Chalk, president of Magna Carta Software Inc., a C tools softwaredeveloper in Garland, Texas, needed a task switcher for a variety of8088-based PCs with 640K bytes of RAM, 20M-byte hard disks and no EMS.andM;&quot;The two things that are critical are using a small amount of RAM for itskernel and being able to swap quickly,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Back andamp; Forth uses solittle memory that you can get reasonable partitions -- at least 555K.&quot;andM;</TEXT></DOC>
