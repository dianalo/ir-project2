The new military ruler, Gen. Andres Rodriguez, announced thatelections for president and Congress will be held in 90 days.   Stroessner led about 20 family members and aides up the steps tothe jet while onlookers at President Stroessner InternationalAirport jeered, clapped and chanted, ``Dictator Get Out!'' and``Adios! Adios!''   Stroessner landed at 5:55 p.m. (3:55 p.m. EST) in Campinas, 290miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro, on a Paraguay Airlines Boeing707, then left on another aircraft for the small town of Itumbiarain the central Brazilian state of Goias, Brazilian sources said.   A foreign ministry source, speaking on condition of anonymity,said Stroessner, who has property in the area, was to stay inItumbiara ``only temporarily.''   Temporary asylum was granted to Stroessner and his son, Gustavo,who was considered Stroessner's heir apparent. Also granted asylumwere Gustavo's wife, Maria; six security guards and ex-ForeignMinister Rodney Elpidio Acevedo, said Jose Roberto Pinto, chief ofthe Brazilian Embassy's political section in Asuncion.   While Stroessner eventually will have to find a permanent home inanother country, no limit was put on how long he might remain inBrazil, Pinto said.   Stroessner came to power as a general in a coup in 1954 andremained commander-in-chief of Paraguay's armed forces untilThursday night, when Rodriguez led the coup against him. Rodriguezwas sworn in as president on Friday.   The two are linked by the marriage of Stroessner's son Alfredoand Rodriguez' daughter Marta, and share grandchildren.   As he left his country for perhaps the last time, the 76-year-oldStroessner wore a blue suit and red tie. He did not acknowledge thecrowd and made no final gesture.   The two black limousines that carried Stroessner's entourage tothe airport were accompanied by truckloads of soldiers in combatgear.   Stroessner had been under house arrest near the capital since hewas captured early Friday after a night of fighting. The death tollfrom the coup has been estimated at up to 300, but no officialfigures have been given.   A funeral Mass for the victims was celebrated Sunday evening.   ``I have been in the hospitals. I have seen the young boys,'' theArchbishop Ismael Rolon of Asuncion, said at packed San RoqueChurch. ``Let us hope that the blood that was shed will help build anew Paraguay.''   Mass celbrants, which included Rodriguez, erupted in applause.   Rodriguez arrived at the airport shortly before Stroessner tookoff and spoke briefly with reporters.   ``I'm going to guarantee all freedoms and total democracy,'' hesaid. Asked how, he replied, ``I will call general elections in 90days.''   Earlier, Foreign Minister Luis Maria Argana discussed theelection plans with reporters at Campo Grande army base. He wasaccompanied by Rodriguez, who did not say if he would run forpresident.   ``Within a few days, we will decree a new election law and a newelectoral system which will dissolve both houses of Congress, andcall for elections within three months dating from last Friday,''said Argana.   Stroessner was elected president eight times, the last time inFebruary 1988. Opposition groups said all the elections werefraudulent.   Under current law, the ruling Colorado Party is guaranteedtwo-thirds control of Congress, with the remaining third splitbetween the two other political parties recognized by the formergovernment.   Argana said the government will recognize opposition parties,including the Authentic Radical Liberal Party and the ChristianDemocrat Party, and allow them to participate in the elections.   Washington so far has withheld official comment on Rodriguez. AWestern diplomat said Saturday that there were reports in Paraguaythat Rodriguez allowed drug traffickers to use his air strip.   Meanwhile, Paraguay's most popular radio station, Radio Nanduti;its biggest daily newspaper, ABC Color; and a weekly known forirreverent commentary, El Pueblo; all announced plans to reopen nowthat Stroessner has been ousted from power.   All were ordered closed by Stroessner for various reasons duringthe past five years, or harassed out of existence.   ``Today we are free. We don't have equipment, we don't have newsteletypes, we don't have our own phones, but it feels great,'' saidHumberto Rubin, director of Radio Nanduti at the station's rundownoffice.</TEXT></DOC>
