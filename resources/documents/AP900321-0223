This night, about 50,000 students await him outside thepresidential palace.   In the minutes before Castro steps to the podium, he can hardlykeep still. He glances around and shifts his feet. He seems hardlyto notice when the throng beneath him chants ``Fidel! Fidel!''   It is an extraordinarily difficult period for him and hiscountry. Not since the 1960s, when the Cold War raged and U.S.hostility seemed irrepressible, has Cuba faced such uncertainty.   How different things are from that day in 1974 when Castropredicted confidently, while host to President Leonid I. Brezhnevof the Soviet Union, that communism eventually would triumph in theworld.   ``Can anyone doubt it?'' he asked.   Those were heady days for the revolution. The United Statesseemed shaken to its roots by the Watergate scandal andskyrocketing oil prices. American troops had been forced fromVietnam a year earlier; the Communist conquest of Indochina wasimminent.   But the world has turned upside down.   Communism appears to have failed in Indochina and has collapsedin Eastern Europe. There are predictions of cataclysmic internalupheaval in the Soviet Union, and Moscow's future economic supportfor Cuba is uncertain.   Against this unpromising background, the students convenedoutside Castro's headquarters one night this month to hear theleader speak.   The mood was upbeat. The students chanted slogans, with arecurring anti-American theme: ``Fidel, for sure, hit the Yankeeshard.''   Someone shouted: ``Anyone who doesn't jump is a Yankee!''Everyone jumped. Castro smiled and jumped, too.   His message was simple: There is no reason to fear because ``theideals of our country are immortal.''   ``Not only will the revolution not fall, it will rise,'' he said.   Castro spoke for 90 minutes and was interrupted dozens of timesby chants and applause.   His commitment to Communist fundamentalism is enshrined in theslogan he now uses at the end of every speech _ ``Socialism orDeath'' _ and huge numbers of Cubans seem prepared to stick withhim.   In that sense, Cuba is not comparable to the countries ofEastern Europe, where the leaders who fell last year were oftenhated by their people.   Arrayed against the pro-Castro militants are what appear to begrowing ranks of disaffected Cubans.   Five years ago, the average number of Cubans fleeing by boat toFlorida, 90 miles away, was one a month. According to U.S. figures,the monthly average has reached 40, despite the threat of prisonterms ranging from one to three years. A resourceful teen-agerrecently made the trip on a surfboard.   Jorge Luis Pichardo, a 26-year-old safety inspector who fled toMiami on a raft last August, said pay in Cuba allows people ``tosubsist but not to live.''   A friend who accompanied him, Gustavo Brugues, son of Cuba'sambassador to Bolivia, said he once spent two days in a food lineto buy pork for a family celebration. ``Sometimes, you have to waitin line and there's nothing at the end of it,'' he said.   On the other side are people like Juan Aizpura Rodriguez. He wasa 15-year-old dropout at the time of the revolution in 1959, apoor, black youngster from one of Havana's many tough neighborhoods.   Aizpura now has a college degree in social science and is on thenational board that governs neighborhood watchdog groups calledCommittees for the Defense of the Revolution. The groups providesocial services and keep an eye out for anti-government activity.   ``If it weren't for the revolution, the broadest majorities ofour population ... would still be suffering,'' Aizpura said.   Perhaps the most pampered Cubans are the children. The amountspent on their health care and education is unusually high for aThird World country.   At a school for slow learners, one of 14 in the capital, theemphasis is on individual attention. It has 47 staff members, onefor each 4{ students. Buses take the students from home to schooland back.   All education has a high priority in Cuba. The number of schools30 years ago was a small fraction of those functioning today.   Nationwide vaccination has sharply reduced childhood diseaseslike measles and whooping cough. Polio was wiped out in 1963.   The official infant mortality rate is 11.1 per thousand, puttingCuba almost on a par with industrialized countries. Before therevolution, the rate was 60.   ``We think we can still reduce it more,'' said Dr. EvilioCabezas of the Public Health Ministry. He credited extensiveprenatal and postnatal care, and added: ``It's all absolutelyfree.''   What kind of lives do these literate, healthy Cubans have? Theyare certainly better off than an estimated 175 million LatinAmericans living in poverty, which Castro says is a byproduct ofcapitalism.   Cuba has hardly any beggars. Begging is illegal.   Unemployment is much lower than elsewhere in Latin America anddrugs are far less of a problem than in the United States.Prostitution has been outlawed, but not eradicated.   A U.S. official who is an expert on Cuba said the revolution hadimproved life for one-third to one-half of Cuba's people.   Lack of freedom is a prime reason why Cubans leave home. Thecurrent political uncertainty has brought harsh repression of humanrights activists and the number of detentions has increased sharply.   Twice in recent weeks, pro-government mobs have formed outsidethe homes of dissidents.   One of those homes belonged to Gustavo Arcos, who has spent atotal of 12 years in prison since breaking with Castro in 1965.``The rules of the game have changed,'' he said. ``They are notgoing to permit any more dissidents.''   Daily life can be demoralizing.   Food markets are dingy and poorly stocked. Apathy at work iscommon. Opportunities for recreation are limited.   Television often is dull. Comparatively few Cubans have theirown cars and a trip across town on the erratic bus system can takehours.   Some medicines are unobtainable and decent housing is in acutelyshort supply. Some residential areas of Havana are in suchdisrepair they resemble war zones.   Can Castro survive? His political thinking is out of line withthe democratic trend among Moscow's allies, but Castro points outadversaries have underestimated him before.   Much will depend on the attitude of the Soviet Union, whichcontributes $5 billion a year to subsidize Cuba's economy. Castrois preparing for the day when Cuba can no longer count on theSoviets.   He has acknowledged that a sharp reduction in Soviet oilshipments could force Cuba to replace tractors with mules, stopmanufacturing adult clothing for five years and reduce bus servicein Havana by two-thirds.   He expresses confidence the revolution will survive without theSoviets, but many experts claim severe hardship would cause anuprising.   Castro told the students: ``From each test, we come out morerevolutionary. From each combat we come out better.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 25</NOTE></DOC>
