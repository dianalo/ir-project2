The Policy document publishedwith this notice is the first draft for review and comment by the generalpublic. Comments will be accepted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceuntil February 15, 1988. The draft was written by representatives of the following organizations:the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service,the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the AmericanFisheries Society, the Sport Fishing Institute, the National Wildlife Federation,the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, and the Gulf States MarineFisheries Commission. This is not an inclusive list of organizations involvedin the Policy drafting effort. Over 65 Federal, State, and tribal governments,and sport fishing constituency and industry groups participated in developingan outline of the Policy statement of purpose, guiding principles, goals,and objectives. This outline guided the previously mentioned groups indrafting the Policy. The purpose of the Policy is to provide a unified set of national guidingprinciples, goals, and objectives for the conservation, management, andwise use of recreational fisheries and the resources on which they depend.The principles, goals, and objectives of the Policy are intended to provideuniform guidance for governmental (Federal, State, tribal, and local) andprivate sector entities in fulfilling their recreational fisheries responsibilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION AND SUBMISSION OF POLICY COMMENTS CONTACT:</T2>GaryEdwards, Assistant Director_Fisheries, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,18th and C Streets, NW., Washington, DC, 20240, (202) 343-6394. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The policy applies to recreationalfisheries on a national scale and is being developed within a broad forumof national participation, hence the term ``<T3>National Policy</T3>''. The Policy represents the collective effortsof Federal, State, and tribal governments, and representatives from privatesector fishery resource constituency groups and industry. <T3>It is not a Federal policy</T3>.The Policy development effort was initiated April 29, 1987, in a discussionheld by the Service with representatives from the aforementioned participatinggroups. The Service offered to coordinate and lead the development effortemphasizing it was to be a national policy as defined above. Since then,an outline of the Policy was drafted by the Service and distributed toover 65 agencies, groups, and individuals for review (including the InternationalAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies who distributed it to the 50States). Comments on the outline were received, a revised outline developed,and a final outline produced by participants at an October 13, 1987, meeting.The final outline was used to write a preliminary draft policy. This draftwas used by a working group of Policy participants to develop the firstpublic review draft presented here. As a policy level document, the Policy is not a strategic plan or actionplan. Actions to implement the goals and objectives of the Policy are theindividual responsibility of the diverse interests involved in recreationalfisheries management. Its guiding principles, goals, and objectives providea conceptual foundation for each interest to build upon either individuallyor cooperatively an within the context of their objective roles and responsibilities.The Policy is an umbrella document that provides long-term common goalsfor conserving and enhancing the Nation's recreational fisheries. The Policysuggests that this is most effectively accomplished through a cooperativeprocess of government-to-public sector cooperation and coordination. A final Policy will be written from comments received on this draft. ThePolicy will then be adopted by participating groups at a National RecreationalFisheries Conference to be held during the first week of June (NationalFishing Week) of 1988. It will then be advanced for national recognitionas the statement of common national goals and objectives for the conservationand enhancement of the Nation's recreational fisheries. <ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 5, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Frank Dunkle,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">National Recreational Fisheries Policy</ITAG>Along its coastlines, bays, and estuaries, throughout its great lakes,reservoirs, and inland rivers, in small ponds, and in upland brooks, theUnited States enjoys the blessings of abundant and diverse fisheries. Thousandsof species of finfish and shellfish can be found in the many habitats ourwaters afford. From the earliest days of our Nation, fish have providedus food and wholesome recreation. With each passing decade, the valuesof our recreational fisheries have become more important. Today, nearly60 million Americans_one in four of our citizens_fish recreationally. Inthe past 30 years, the number of anglers has more than doubled. And thetotal expenditures anglers contribute to the economy now approach $30 billionannually.``Recreational fishing'' is a phrase as expansive and complex as the bountyof our waters and the impacts of fishing on our society. It includes theNation's bass and trout anglers who have given voice to conservation concernsand have recognized the need for protection and replenishment of our waters.The phrase also embraces the big game anglers, who, in specially designedcraft replete with sophisticated gear, roam the blue waters for marlin,tuna, sailfish, and other potential trophies of the deep. So too, the phraseenfolds the aging angler quietly watching baited line along the bank ofa slow moving river or the eager child swiftly hoisting the first bluegillor yellow perch from an urban pond. But, as the number of meanings grows,so likewise does a need to acknowledge the deepening value of this Nation'srecreational fisheries.Why, each year, do more and more of our citizens heed the call of the waters?Anglers have many reasons to fish. Historically, and at present, many fishto catch quality food. Moreover they fish for relaxation and for excitement,for the thrill of capture and for the joy of release, for the fellowhipand for the solitude, for the enjoyment of nature's tranquillity and forthe challenge of encountering the raw elements, for escape from the dailyroutine, and for involvement in the complexity of the natural world. Most,perhaps, respond to an ancient human trait_anticipation_the expectationof catching fish.But will high quality fish and fishing opportunities remain available?Fish have been among our most valuable natural resources. We have learned_asthe fish themselves have demonstrated_their renewable nature. But theirresiliency is limited. Overharvest, pollution, and loss of habitat allcontribute to their depletion.The potential for fishery loss has grown apace with our population. Fortunately,this depletion has been recognized as a national problem and protectionof our fishery resources has been assured_significantly_through local,State, and Federal laws. Important as these statutes and regulations maybe, however, it is also appropriate for the citizens of the United States,by themselves and through the various government entities that serve them,to make a national statement proclaiming the worth attached to recreationalfisheries and to the abiding need for conserving fishery resources. Sucha need can be fulfilled through a National Recreational Fisheries Policy.This National Recreational Fisheries Policy (Policy) signals a nationwidecommitment by governments, the private sector, and all interested citizensto overcome adversities to recreational fisheries, serves as a statementof common national goals for the conservation and improvement of the Nation'srecreational fishery resources, and calls for a strengthened partnershipbetween government and the private sector to attain these goals. This Policy constitutes a foundation and forward step in ensuring abundant,healthy recreational fishery resources. In turn, these resources will providean enduring source of pleasure for all Americans and ensure a continuingflow of social and economic benefits to the Nation.Policy StatementThe National Recreational Fisheries Policy declares that the Nation's recreationalfisheries provide significant benefits to our families, individuals, society,and the national economy. These benefits depend upon achieving and maintaininghealthy fish populations and their habitats. This Policy further declaresthat governments recognize they are vested by the citizens with stewardshipresponsibility and that an active government effort, in partnership withthe private sector, is needed to maintain and promote the conservationand enhancement of recreational fisheries for the continuing benefit ofthe Nation.Statement of PurposeThe National Recreational Fisheries Policy establishes guiding principles,goals, and objectives for the conservation and enhancement of the Nation'sfish populations, the habitats they depend on, and the recreational fisheriesthey support. The objectives will be achieved within the framework of respectivegovernment and private sector responsibilities.Guiding Principles The guiding principles of the National Recreational Fisheries Policy are:<ITAG tagnum="81">Recreational Fisheries Contribute Significant Social and EconomicBenefits to the Nation </ITAG>Recreational fishing is a cherished American tradition and an importantactivity contributing to the economic well-being of the Nation. The recreationalfishing industry annually makes a multi-billion dollar contribution tothe Nation's economy. <ITAG tagnum="81">Recreational Fisheries Depend on Abundant Fishery Resources </ITAG>Healthy fisheries are maintained through sound scientific management offish populations and their habitats. Fisheries can be restored and improvedby taking advantage of opportunities to improve the quality and quantityof the habitats upon which they depend. <ITAG tagnum="81">Governments and the Private Sector Must Work in Partnership to AdvanceStewardship of Recreational Fisheries </ITAG>Governments are vested with respective stewardship responsibilities toprotect, conserve, and enhance fishery resources for the public benefit.Partnerships between governments and the private sector provide greateropportunities for maintaining and improving fisheries. The Federal Governmentshould encourage such partnerships and be an active participant where consistentwith its responsibilities. <ITAG tagnum="81">Existing Authorities and Responsibilities of Governments Will Be Recognized</ITAG>This Policy recognizes that States and tribes have proprietary rights andresponsibilities for management, policy making, and licensing of the fisheryresources and anglers under their purview. Additionally, tribes have aunique status and are dealt with on a government-to-government basis, underself-determination policies. The Policy further confirms the Federal Government'sstrong support for the continued rights of states and tribes in fisheryresource matters and for its own commitment to carry out its responsibilitiesand role for fishery resource management and conservation.Goals<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Increase the Productivity of Fishery Resources</ITAG>Fish populations and their habitats continue to decline while numbers ofanglers and total days of fishing increase. The U.S. Fish and WildlifeService's 1985 National Survery of Hunting, Fishing, and Wildlife AssociatedRecreation reports that the increase in the number of anglers exceeds therate of national population growth. Providing abundant fishery resourcesfor future anglers will require more than just stemming habitat and fishpopulation declines. It will require concerted and diligent efforts byall parties to maintain, restore, and increase the productivity of existingpopulations and their habitats, including creation of new fishing opportunities,and efforts to increase the utility of the information base from whichmanagement decisions are made.<T3>Objectives_</T3>A. <T3>Promote the conservation and enhancement of fish stocks and their habitats.</T3>Healthy and productive habitat is the foundation for maintaining vigorousfish populations. Accordingly, there must be concerted efforts to conserveremaining habitats, restore degraded habitats, and improve habitat productivity.Critical habitat issues include maintenance of water quality and suitableflows for fish, control of toxic contaminants, and the protection and restorationof riparian areas, watersheds, wetlands, estuaries, and offshore waters.With a productive habitat base, effective conservation depends on developmentof biologically sound management plans that strive to provide fishing opportunitieswhile maintaining productive capabilities, prevention of overharvest throughappropriate education, regulatory and law enforcement measures, incorporationof conservation and enhancement considerations for fishery resources intoFederal land and water development activities, and, most importantly, responsiveaction from the public to uphold and support wise management activities.Fish stocks and habitat can be enhanced and created through activitiessuch as carefully considered fish stocking programs, instream and riparianhabitat improvement efforts, and artificial reefs.B. <T3>Promote, support, and conduct research and development in support offisheries management. </T3>Sustained high quality fishing depends on healthyfishery resources maintained through sound scientific management supportedby research. Research must continue to provide the tools for protecting,restoring, and enhancing fishery resources as well as for a greater understandingof the resources themselves. Research by the private sector is encouraged.Techniques must be improved and refined to monitor accurately the statusof fish populations and improve population trend forecasting. Improvedfish culture and health care techniques must be developed. Quantitativepopulation genetics must be improved for predicting the effects of wildstock/hatchery stock interbreeding, hatchery breeding practices, and reductionsin gene pools. Habitat evaluation procedures must be standardized, habitatrestoration and enhancement techniques refined, and habitat producitivitybetter understood.C. <T3>Develop and maintain biological, social, and economic data bases onrecreational fisheries. </T3>Existing data bases and surveys, such as theNational Marine Fisheries Service's Recreational Fisheries Statistics Surveyand the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Survey of Hunting, Fishing,and Wildlife-Associated Recreation should be evaluated on a continuingbasis to improve their utility for decision making in recreational fisheriesmanagement. In addition to providing data on catch and effort, surveysshould include social and economic data such as angler preferences, demographics,and trip expenditures. Management agencies should strive for comprehensiveness,timeliness, accuracy, and comparability of recreational fisheries surveys.<ITAG tagnum="81">II. Increase the Quality and Diversity of Recreational Fishing Opportunities</ITAG>A primary purpose of maintaining healthy fishery resources is to providepublic fishing opportunities. These should include different kinds of fishingexperiences in a variety of aquatic habitats. Public preferences are importantin determining the opportunities fisheries managers should seek to provide.Decision makers should provide leadership and creativity in defining therange of potential opportunities and be responsible for ensuring wise useof the fishery resources.<T3>Objectives_</T3>A. <T3>Enhance and diversify recreational experiences. </T3>Recreational fisheriescan be enhanced by creating new fisheries in underused areas such as citiesand suburbs, privately owned waters, and government lands. Redirectionof fishing to new areas and underused species can help alleviate pressureon other crowded fisheries. Fishing opportunities can also be enhancedthrough habitat management such as constructing artificial reefs, constructionof new lakes, and management of instream flows.Recreational fishing preferences and methods change. Recognizing this factunderscores the need to protect and conserve all potential recreationalfisheries, lest a valuable future resource be lost or depleted needlessly.Management entities should work to promote the concept that quality fishingcan be maintained under circumstances where quantity of fishing is notfeasible. Providing diversity in fishing opportunities is one means topromote quality fishing and is key to providing satisfaction for the tremendousvariations in angler preferences. Diversity can be maintained and enhancedthrough options such as put-and-take fishing, catch-and-release fishing,equipment limitations, trophy fishing areas, and various length and creellimits.   More people are beginning to enjoy fish without fishing. Increasing numbersof non-consumptive users enjoy watching, studying, and photographing fish,sightseeing at fish ladders, and visiting hatcheries. Additional opportunitiesfor such activities should be encouraged and created.     B. <T3>Increase access to recreational fisheries. </T3>Governments and theprivate sector should seek opportunities to increase public fishing accesswith appropriate recognition of private property rights. Boat ramps, fishingsites, and shore access should be considered in mitigation and enhancementactivities. The unique needs of children, senior citizens, and the handicappedshould be addressed so that they may participate more fully in fishing.<ITAG tagnum="81">III. Enhance Partnerships Between Governments and the Private Sectorfor Conserving and Managing Recreational Fisheries</ITAG>In addition to biological factors, effective fishery management must dealwith social, economic, and political issues. There is an expanding arrayof government agencies, councils, committees, and commissions that addressthese issues. However, in order to develop coherent national programs forrecreational fisheries, these entities should strive to define and coordinatetheir roles and responsibilities better. Efforts to improve should alsoextend to the thousands of local and national private-sector constituencygroups, clubs, and industry organizations. Governments and private sectorcooperation is crucial to develop and manage recreational fisheries effectively.<T3>Objectives</T3>_A. <T3>Develop structured forms for exchange of information and program coordinationbetween government agencies and private groups. </T3>Governments, constituencygroups, and industries should improve the quality and increase the quantityof their informational materials, and should strive for better distribution.Recreational fisheries would be well served by conferences co-sponsoredby government agencies, constituency groups, and the recreational fishingindustry. There should be more government representation at meetings of constituencygroups. Likewise, public policymaking groups should encourage early involvementof anglers and the private sector in making decisions that affect them.Issues and programs of common concern should be identified and cooperativestrategies between involved entities developed to reduce overlaps in effort,increase efficiencies, and reduce the potential for fragmentation. B. <T3>Develop and promote mechanisms for the private sector to participatein fisheries programs and projects. </T3>Cooperation between citizens andthe government provides a sense of shared pride and ownership in the Nation'sfishery resources. Participation by the private sector in recreationalfisheries programs should be encouraged by such mechanisms as governmentchallenge grants, technical assistance, and cost sharing. Governments shouldincrease opportunities for private involvement on public lands for surveys,habitat improvement, access development, and other fisheries conservationand enhancement projects. C. <T3>Increase public concern for and participation in fisheries conservation,and improve angler ethics. </T3>An informed, concerned, and involved publicis essential to maintaining and enhancing recreational fisheries. Governments,industry, and constituency groups should continue their informational andeducational programs designed to build concern and support for fisheryresources conservation efforts. For more than a century, anglers have demonstratedtheir willingness to conserve and replenish recreational fisheries throughlicenses, excise taxes, and user fees. This tradition of public supportmust continue.  Anglers can further share responsibility for fishery resources conservationby adopting and promoting an angling code of ethics that respects the rightsand interests of other anglers and property owners and demonstrates concernfor wise use of the resource. <ITAG tagnum="81">IV. Promote a Healthy Recreational Fisheries Industry </ITAG>The well-being of the recreational fishing industry depends on maintainingand enhancing fishery resources. If the Nation's fisheries are sound, thenthe industry can prosper and, in the process, provide jobs to millionsof our citizens. This industry also stands to prosper not just by providingappropriate goods and services to anglers, but by supporting public educationin aquatic resource issues. <T3>Objectives_</T3>A. <T3>Maintain and enhance fishery resources. </T3>Just as government hasa responsibility for maintaining health recreational fisheries, so too,industry and its constituency groups need to support effective fisheriesconservation policies and projects to ensure stability and benefits theyseek for industry. B. <T3>Provide goods and services, and information on fishing opportunities.</T3>Anglers require a wide variety of high quality goods and services.The recreational fishing industry should provide these for the broad rangeof economic and physical abilities and angler preferences. With healthyfisheries and appropriate data, the industry should stimulate recreationalfishing through marketing research promotion. Governments, industry, and constituency groups can further fisheries conservationby increasing outreach efforts to beginning anglers, providing fishinginstruction, and distributing information on fishing opportunities andfishery resources conservation. Conclusion This Policy is a first step toward developing a comprehensive nationaleffort to improve the health and abundance of the Nation's fishery resources.Achieving Policy goals will provide improved fishing, more responsive andcapable management, and a more informed and participatory private sector.Local, State, tribal, and Federal governments have individual and commonresponsibilities for recreational fisheries. Constituency groups and industryhave their own organizational mandates to guide them. This Policy providesa framework of common goals and objectives that each entity can advanceindividually or cooperatively. All of these groups must commit to translating the goals of the NationalRecreational Fisheries Policy into productive actions so that all Americanscan continue to enjoy this Nation's recreational fisheries.
