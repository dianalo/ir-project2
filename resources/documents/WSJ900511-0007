Expects to Report   Narrowed Loss for Fiscal Fourth Quarter   ----   By Richard Turner   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/11/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B5A</SO><CO>   AURA GD MCA PCI SNE AEN</CO><IN>DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)</IN><LP>   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Aura Systems Inc. expects to reportthat its loss for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 28 narrowedto between $250,000 and $300,000 from a loss of $552,000 ayear earlier, President Harry Kurtzman said.   He said fourth-quarter revenue went to about $2 millionfrom $1 million a year ago.</LP><TEXT>   For the full year, Mr. Kurtzman said, the loss widened toabout $2 million, or 10 cents a share, from last year's lossof $1.5 million, or seven cents a share, on a surge inrevenue to more than $9 million from $2.8 million a year ago.   Mr. Kurtzman stressed that the revenue nearly all camefrom research-and-development contracts, &quot;almost equivalentto investments,&quot; he said. &quot;When most people talk aboutrevenue, they talk about selling something,&quot; he added. Hesaid the company would be manufacturing and deliveringproducts before the end of fiscal 1991, and said he expectsAura to be profitable for the year.   Chief Financial Officer Frank Phalen said the company hadreceived a contract from General Dynamics Corp. to developmagnetic devices for an advanced reconnaissance system thatcontains a commitment of about $1 million but could generaterevenue of more than $50 million over the next 10 years ifthe devices later go into production.   Mr. Kurtzman, in an interview, said he expects revenue todouble in the coming fiscal year, though he said two-thirdsof it would still be the research-and-development area. Thecompany was founded in 1987.   Mr. Kurtzman also outlined progress in the electro-opticaland electromagnetic segments of Aura's business. The companyholds two patents on a technology it developed to &quot;isolate&quot;equipment in an electromagnetic field, which eliminatesvibration. The process can be used to prevent &quot;jitters&quot; incameras on aircraft, and Mr. Kurtzman said the process alsohas applications for vehicle shock absorbers, and stereospeakers.   Meanwhile, government research interest continues, Mr.Kurtzman said. He said Aura is waiting for final governmentalapproval of a $1.2 million contract with the U.S. Air Forceto use the high-resolution display system to test infraredmilitary sensors used in intelligence-gathering.   Mr. Kurtzman said there are potential applications in theentertainment business as well. The company's electro-opticalunit has five patents pending on a high definition televisionsystem, and he said the company would announce a partnershipwith an entertainment company soon.   Aura has built a prototype for a projection system thatpotentially could show films transmitted to movie theaters bysatellite or cable through a television signal, removing theneed for shipping numerous (and costly) film prints toindividual theaters. Aura's system purports to display thistelevision image on huge movie screens with film-likeresolution and brightness. Mr. Kurtzman said MCA Inc.,Paramount Communications Inc., Sony Corp.'s ColumbiaPictures, AMC Entertainment Inc. and other companies haveexpressed interest in the process.   In the electromagnetic area, Mr. Kurtzman said thecompany's technology could have applications for elevators intall buildings, to cut down lateral shaking. It could also beused to prevent vibration and blurriness in film cameras thatride on dollies. Aura is also studying the use of the processin stereo speakers, where electromagnetism can conveylow-frequency, or bass, notes much lower than conventionalspeakers can.   The company also has an advanced computing and amicroelectronics division that together generated about $1million in revenue in the past fiscal year, Mr. Kurtzmansaid.</TEXT></DOC>
