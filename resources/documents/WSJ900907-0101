Until the Berlin Wall collapsed, the biannual event was byfar the most important meeting place for business betweenEast and West -- and a convenient stage for East Germany toflex its economic muscle before the eyes of the world. Butnow, with East Germany a month away from a full merger withcapitalist West Germany and its own economy in shambles, thefair is losing its special status.</LP><TEXT>   Under the Communists, foreign trade was jealouslycontrolled by central planners, so having a booth in Leipzigwas considered one of the few chances a Western company mighthave to make contact with potential partners. &quot;You had to bein Leipzig if you wanted to get your foot in the door,&quot; saysJohannes von Thadden, an economist with the West GermanChambers of Commerce and Industry. Now, he says, &quot;Leipzigwill be just another big fair in a united Germany, and itwill have to compete to survive.&quot;   East German companies will have to follow the same advice.This fall's trade fair is taking place against a backgroundof deepening economic turmoil in this once staunchlycommunist country, and some wonder whether the East Germany'sflabby firms will survive. Many East bloc companies whichonce proudly displayed their products here as evidence of&quot;socialist efficiency&quot; are now using the fair like a giantfire sale -- perhaps their last chance to find Westernpartners who can help them make the difficult transition tothe market economy. &quot;We talked about our own success for solong, we started to believe in it,&quot; says a spokesman for oneEast German chemical company, who asked not to be named.   Still, Leipzig is still Leipzig, and the Germans no doubtwill get some good news out of it. The trade fair istraditionally a time when firms announce new ventures.   Right on schedule, Daimler-Benz AG let the news leak outthat it intends to pour one billion German marks ($634million) into a truck plant in the East German town ofLudwigsfelde. The plant is expected to start producing 6,000medium-weight trucks by next year, with an annual productiontarget of 40,000 trucks by the middle of the decade.   And the fair is fully booked, as usual, with 6,000 firmsrepresented from 54 countries -- including North Korea andCuba. But the number of East German companies present hasplunged from 1,800 to 1,000 this year, while Western firmsbooked twice as much space as in 1989. Ironically, lastyear's fall fair didn't allow the usual number of Westernfirms because Communist authorities worried that badpublicity might arise from the protest movement that wascentered in Leipzig.   Many German politicians are hoping this fall's trade fairwill mark the economic turning point they've long awaited.Last week, the two Germanys signed a treaty clearing the lasthurdles to unification on Oct. 3. The document covers manyissues crucial to business, including how East Germany willhandle land claims from former owners.   The treaty was the favorite topic for politicians fromboth Germanys who descended on Leipzig earlier this week toopen the week-long fair. West German Economics MinisterHelmut Haussmann dubbed the treaty a &quot;major breakthrough&quot; forinvestors, adding that he was hoping to see indications ofthis in Leipzig. East German Prime Minister Lothar deMaiziere went so far as to say Leipzig was now ripe to becomean &quot;investment fair.&quot;   But despite such high hopes, Mr. de Maiziere got preciouslittle encouragement during a morning stroll through thefair's sprawling grounds. Representatives from Japan's JukiCorp., a leading producer of sewing machines, greeted theEast German warmly. But when asked by Mr. de Maiziere whetherthe Japanese firm planned any investments in East Germany,company officials gave a polite but clear, &quot;No.&quot;   While the likes of Daimler-Benz may be forging ahead withinvestments in East Germany, the question in Leipzig iswhether smaller West German firms are ready to follow suit.&quot;In the long run,&quot; says Mr. von Thadden, the West Germaneconomist, &quot;getting the smaller firms is more important,because it shows that there are good business opportunitieseven for those without special muscle.&quot;   Against this background, many German officials say Leipzigwill continue to play an important -- though not amonopolisticrole in East-West trade. Mr. Haussmann, speakingafter a quick visit to the fair, said it would be wrong tosuddenly detach East Germany from its traditional tradingpartners in the East. He admitted, however, that Leipzigneeds to work on its &quot;concept&quot; as a trade fair center insidea new Germany.   Indeed, East German organizers have already launched afrenzied effort to strengthen the Leipzig tradition. They aresetting up a series of specialized fairs, focusing onindustries such as construction and tourism, to run parallelto the more famous spring and fall events.   Even if the effort fails, it will be a long time beforethe legacy of Leipzig is forgotten. With a history as a tradecenter dating back eight centuries, many Leipzigers considerbig trade fairs part of their identity. Elmar Pieroth, aleading member of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl'sChristian Democrats, remembers coming to Leipzig in 1988,when he was an honored guest of East German party boss ErichHonecker at a reception in the town's government guest house.This year, Mr. Pieroth hosted an informal lunch in the samesetting. &quot;It looks like Leipzig, but it feels totallydifferent,&quot; he said.   Of course, many would like to forget some of the detailsof Leipzig's past. Under the Communists, Leipzig's springfair sported such oddities as hundreds of Erich Honeckerposters and a booth devoted to the Palestine LiberationOrganization. A spokeswoman for the fair says she's not surewhether the PLO will come next spring, since the deadline forapplications has not yet passed. &quot;Of course,&quot; she says,&quot;everyone is welcome in Leipzig who wants to come.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
