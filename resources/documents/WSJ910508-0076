The $445 million sale was closed last Friday after theTransportation Department rejected a petition for a stay. Thedepartment cleared the controversial sale late last month.</LP><TEXT>   A group including the city of St. Louis and TWA unions aretrying to block the transfer of the London routes toAmerican. They have been backing an effort by investor KirkKerkorian to buy Trans World Airlines. Mr. Kerkorian has saidhe would buy TWA only with the London routes intact.   Yesterday's decision by an appeals court in Missouri isconsidered a victory for the group because the courtscheduled oral arguments on the case for May 31. The datecould give the court time to remand the TransportationDepartment's approval of the route sale before the scheduledtransfer takes place July 1.   American agreed last Thursday to pay $445 million for thethree routes from New York, Los Angeles and Boston, althoughthe package originally included six routes. TheTransportation Department rejected the sale of the otherthree routes.   Separately, a federal judge in White Plains, N.Y., issueda final order allowing a group of TWA noteholders torepossess 10 of the carrier's jets and 62 of its engineswithin 10 business days. TWA defaulted on notes backed by theaircraft and engines.   But it is unlikely that TWA will be forced to turn overthe assets any time soon. The carrier is expected to appealthe ruling by federal judge Gerard Goettel, and seek a staypending a decision by an appeals court.   TWA officials also are negotiating with ConnecticutNational Bank, trustee for the noteholders, to reach apossible settlement that would enable the airline to keep theproperty. Yesterday's decision affirmed an opinion by thejudge last week.</TEXT></DOC>
