<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-24-0539 </DOCNO><TEXT>Characteristics of polycarbosilane (PCS) type SiC/Al preform wires andtheir hot-pressed sheets were investigated to clarify their responsesto thermal and neutron exposure. Mechanical properties were measuredby tensile and three-point bending tests. Microstructures were inspectedby SEM and TEM. The effects of neutron irradiation were studied usingfission neutrons from JOYO and JMTR and with 14-MeV neutrons from RTNS-II.The SiC/Al composite and SiC fiber showed excellent stability under neutronirradiation. Increments of tensile strength and Young's modulus wereclearly observed after irradiation in JOYO. 12 references.</TEXT></DOC>
