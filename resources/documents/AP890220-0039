Tsugio Uesaka and Yoshimichi Udagawa of Daikin Industries Ltd.were arrested for forging export documents and selling nearly purehalogenated hydrocarbon to the Soviet Union, police officials inOsaka said   Exports of the solution in concentrated form to communistcountries are prohibited under Japanese law and under aninternational agreement regulating the sale of high-technologyproducts to Soviet bloc nations.   Halogenated hydrocarbon, a compound commonly used in fireextinguishers, can also be used as a coolant for guided missiles,analysts say.   Daikin, a major air conditioner maker based in Osaka, apologizedfor the illegal exports but denied any responsibility for the sale,saying the two executives had acted independently.   ``It is regrettable that two employees of our company werearrested,'' Daikin General Manager Tadashi Shibai told a newsconference. ``But I don't believe they were aware that they wereviolating the law.''   Police said the two executives approved exports of the chemicalsolution with a purity of more than 99.8 percent to the Soviet Unionbetween February 1986 and May 1988.   Uesaka, head of the company's inspection section, submittedfraudulent export declarations which understated the product'spurity, police said. Government permission is not needed for exportsof the chemical with purity levels of less than 99.8 percent.   Udagawa, head of the administration and planning section, andUesaka have not been formally charged. They were arrested forviolating the Foreign Exchange and Export Control Law.   The company began exporting the high-grade chemical to the SovietUnion in 1979 after receiving special permission from theCoordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Control, aninternational organization regulating the flow of high-technologygoods to communist bloc countries.   However, it soon halted the exports when the international bodyreinstated an export ban following the Soviet military interventionin Afghanistan.   In 1987, Toshiba Machine Co., a subsidairy of Toshiba Corp., wascharged with illegally exporting sophisticated computerized millingequipment to the Soviet Union.   The case created widespread public outrage in the United States.The U.S. government subsequently imposed sanctions on the company,including a three-year prohibition on exports to the United States.   In April, two small Japanese trading firms were charged withillegally exporting sophisticated digital testing equipment toChina, leading to the arrest of three company officials. The case isstill pending.</TEXT></DOC>
