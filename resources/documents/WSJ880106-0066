Even though the 1988 election marks the first time a woman has run a major presidential campaign -- Susan Estrich, the Harvard-trained lawyer and Harvard Law School professor who manages Michael Dukakis's drive -- a Wall Street Journal analysis shows that women and minorities have made relatively few inroads among the upper echelons of presidential candidates' staffs.    White men make up 41% of the U.S. population, but they still hold 78% of the top campaign jobs, despite the gains that women and minorities have made over the past decade or so. Women, who constitute slightly over half of the population, account for just 15% of the top campaign spots. And minorities, who are 15% of the population, hold just 8% of those senior campaign jobs, the analysis indicates.    &quot;There's much more lip service to women's rights and women's issues, but clearly the numbers are unacceptable,&quot; says historian Elisabeth Griffith, a Republican board member of the bipartisan Women's Campaign Fund. &quot;A fundamental problem is lack of confidence and fear of backlash,&quot; says Eddie Williams, head of the Joint Center for Political Studies, which monitors black political participation.    Among the highlights of the Journal's analysis, which didn't include the recently revived, but almost unstaffed Gary Hart campaign:   --Surprisingly, the campaign of Republican Pat Robertson, the conservative former television evangelist, has the largest number of women in top campaign jobs. Three of his top 10 senior campaign aides are women.    --Not one of the Republican candidates has a minority staffer in his top 10 campaign jobs. &quot;It's inexcusable,&quot; acknowledges John Buckley, the spokesman for GOP Rep. Jack Kemp. Mr. Kemp has frequently spoken out about the need for his party to broaden its base among minorities, suggesting that first the GOP has to learn how to win black votes. Every one of the Democratic campaigns has at least one minority in the senior staff.    --The campaign of former GOP Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware has a 100% record: All of the top staffers are white males. &quot;It's just the uniqueness of who's attracted to the political process,&quot; suggests du Pont press secretary Frederick Stern. &quot;The people who have approached us to join the campaign have been generally male and generally white.&quot;    --Even black presidential candidate Jesse Jackson has a white campaign manager. Mr. Jackson, who had a largely black campaign staff in 1984, deliberately selected a white man, Gerald Austin, to be run his 1988 effort because he wanted to show that he &quot;really is serious about winning, and not make it a black campaign,&quot; says Mr. Austin. Five of Mr. Jackson's top aides are minorities; two are women.    The Journal drew up its lists of the top 10 advisers -- necessarily a subjective ranking -- from information supplied by high-level campaign aides about which staffers were most involved in the areas of fund-raising, strategy, field organizing, media and message. In most cases, the lists include the staffers running the two earliest-contest states, Iowa and New Hampshire. The lists didn't include candidates' family members and some elected politicians who are important advisers, such as House Majority Whip Tony Coelho for Rep. Richard Gephardt, Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter for Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Sen. Warren Rudman for Sen. Robert Dole.    After the Journal later asked for comment about the percentages of minorities and women, several campaigns argued that more women or minority staffers should be substituted for white males in their lists of the top 10, but most of these arguments weren't accepted.    Some news accounts, noting Ms. Estrich's appointment, have suggested that 1988 is a breakthrough year for women in presidential politics; in many campaigns, women have important roles just under the top 10 jobs. &quot;While the numbers don't look great they still look better than previous election years,&quot; says Irene Natividad, who heads the National Women's Political Caucus. A study by the caucus found that women hold almost half of the overall staff jobs in most campaigns.    Yet the evidence suggests that women still have a long way to go. &quot;Progress is coming,&quot; says Ms. Estrich, &quot;but it's probably coming a whole lot more slowly than many expected.&quot;    On the subject of pay, for instance, a study of the 12 staffs conducted by the Women's Political Caucus found men's average salaries were higher than women's in every campaign except that of Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis.    There are similar concerns about the paucity of minority-group members at the top levels of the presidential campaigns. Christopher Edley Jr., a black Harvard Law School professor who is Mr. Dukakis's issues adviser, worries that young blacks aren't rising in the campaign ranks because they can't afford to start out as volunteers, the way so many political experts do. &quot;It's not an attitude problem, it's an economic problem,&quot; he says.    Peter Teeley, Vice President George Bush's spokesman, says, &quot;It's very difficult, sadly, to bring blacks into the Republican process.&quot;    What's more, the lack of minorities and women in the top campaign ranks is far more important than the overall numbers of such staffers in a campaign. For one thing, that is the level where the key campaign decisions are made. For another, top political aides often become high-ranking presidential advisers or cabinet officers, as did John Mitchell for Richard Nixon, Hamilton Jordan for Jimmy Carter, and William Casey, James Baker and Edwin Meese for Ronald Reagan.    Most of the campaigns insist they are trying to reach out to get more minorities and women involved. When Mr. Kemp is asked about the roles of minorities and women in his campaign, he says: &quot;We have a lot of Jews in the campaign. Women are spokesmen in a lot of states.&quot; The Gephardt campaign notes that it has just hired a woman, Ali Webb, to be press secretary. Aides to Mr. Dole, Mr. du Pont, Mr. Kemp and some others cited strong records of appointing women to top jobs on their congressional or gubernatorial staffs.    Yet many minority and female aides say significant obstacles remain in the presidential arena. &quot;I feel very good about the progress we've made, but it's been very lonely, very difficult at times,&quot; says Donna Brazile, a 28-year-old black janitor's daughter who is Mr. Gephardt's national field director. &quot;The barriers still exist,&quot; she says. &quot;They're walls, even.&quot;    Here is a list of the candidates' staffers:   BABBITT: Duane Garrett, national chairman; Lauren Post, finance director; Greg Schneiders, pollster; Frederick DuVal, campaign manager; Barton Gellman, issues director; Elaine Kamarck, deputy campaign manager; Michael McCurry, press secretary; Sergio Bendixen, consultant; Christopher Hamel, Iowa coordinator; Michael Muir, New Hampshire coordinator.
