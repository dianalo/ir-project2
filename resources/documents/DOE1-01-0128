Thisanode structure should permit protection against photocorrosion effects,which are considerable for unprotected cadmium sulfide. It is also generallytrue for all the semiconductors with small band gaps. This coating willhelp to provide better long term stability of CdS electrodes. In thisstudy the rate at which the photocurrent decreases in time as a functionof the polymer thickness has been investigated. The choice of Formvar(a polyvinyl acetal resin in dioxane) as the polymer, was from our experiencewith this material in tunnel effect junction devices.</TEXT></DOC>
