All measurements were made with a cylindricalionization chamber in water, for a field size of 10 x 10 cm{sup 2} witha source--skin distance of 80 or 100 cm. We conclude that, for the acceleratorsstudied, the WTF factor at depth is less than 2% different from thatdetermined at d/sub max/ (for the nominal wedge angles and photon energiesstudied) unless the depth of interest is greater than 10 cm. Up to themaximum depth studied (25 cm) the relative wedge factor: that is, wedgefactor at depth compared to that determined at d/sub max/ : was aboutequal to or less than 1.02 for the 15{sup 0} and 30{sup 0} wedges andany of the photon beam energies studied. For the seldom utilized combinationof a nominal wedge angle in excess of 45{sup 0} with a depth greaterthan 10 cm, the WTF at depth can differ from the WTF determined at d/submax/, by up to 5%. Since the wedge transmission factor is reflectiveof relative percent dose data, our results also indicate that it is inerror to use open field percent depth doses for certain combinationsof wedge angle, photon energy, and depth.</TEXT></DOC>
