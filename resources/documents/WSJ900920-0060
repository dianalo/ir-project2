The FCC's modified price-cap system was designed to keep alid on rates for broad categories of services while givingthe phone companies flexibility to quickly raise or lowerprices and incentives to operate more efficiently. If thephone companies can boost efficiency, their reward is higherprofits.</LP><TEXT>   The price-cap plan, which goes into effect Jan. 1, ismandatory for the seven regional Bell companies and GTECorp.'s local telephone operations. It is optional forsmaller phone companies. The commission's nearly unanimousvote -- Commissioner Ervin Duggan dissented to part of theplan -- comes a year and a half after the agency adoptedprice caps for American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.   The commission's action applies to fees charged tolong-distance carriers and big companies for access to localtelephone networks. The agency figures it could reducelong-distance rates by slightly more than $2.8 billion overthe next four years compared with rates under the currentregulatory system, which allows companies to earn a specifiedreturn on specified investments.   At yesterday's meeting, the commission also voted to lowerthe allowed rate of return to 11.25% from 12% for local phonecompanies -- including the hundreds that won't be coveredunder price caps. The agency said the lower rate strikes abalance between phone companies' continued access to capitalmarkets and fair rates for customers. The commission figuresthe new rate, which goes into effect Jan. 1, will cut feesfor access to local phone networks by $337 million, of which$317 million is attributed to the Baby Bells and GTE.   The FCC believes the price-cap plan gives phone companiesan incentive to lower their costs and operate moreefficiently, translating into lower rates and better servicefor customers. Most phone customers, the agency claims, willsee indirect benefits as long-distance companies, which buyservices that allow access to the local phone networks, passalong savings.   The plan drew swift criticism from user and consumergroups. &quot;This isn't price caps. It's profit-inflating, laggedrate-of-return regulation,&quot; complained Gene Kimmelman,legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America.The outcome for most consumers, he said, will probably behigher prices for long-distance service.   &quot;Instead of spurring investment in the telephone networks,this could choke it,&quot; said Brian Moir, a Washington lawyerwho represents the International Communications Association,a group of big corporate telecommunications users.   Commissioner Duggan raised similar concerns in his partialdissent, saying he feared higher rates would result from acomplicated price-capping formula for subscriber line accessto local phone networks.   Analysts, however, were enthusiastic about thecommission's decision. &quot;In real terms, the Bells will earnmore money in 1991,&quot; said Jack Grubman of PaineWebber. Theirproductivity gains, he said, far exceed the gains implied bythe FCC's price-cap mechanism.   Eventually, the new regulatory plan &quot;will begin todifferentiate the companies, separating the wheat from thechaff,&quot; said Robert B. Morris III of Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., whonevertheless raised some concerns about the long-termimplications. &quot;Clearly in the short term, it is constructivefor the Bells,&quot; he said. &quot;But it remains to be seen how theindustry will manage this.&quot;   Under the commission's plan, the caps will be applied tofour large &quot;baskets&quot; of service. The commission set limits onprice fluctuations for service categories within thosebaskets. Much of the debate in recent months has focused onan algebraic equation used to calculate the price cap forsubscriber line access to local networks, and the localcompanies were busy yesterday testing how that formula willwork in real life.   &quot;We're running the numbers right now,&quot; said Linda Burr,director of federal regulatory matters at Pacific TelesisGroup's Pacific Bell unit. &quot;In general, though, we're happywith the FCC's decision.&quot;   The price-cap formula doesn't abandon traditional rate ofreturn regulation, which allows phone companies to earn aspecified return on their investment base. The commissionalso said it will continue collecting phone company cost dataas well as information on service standards as a way ofmonitoring consumer benefits under price caps. The commissionis using July 1, 1990, rates as a starting point forprice-cap indexes, adjusted down to reflect the new 11.25%rate of return.   To determine the price cap, the agency is using a formulathat measures inflation, costs beyond a company's controlsuch as changes in tax laws, and expected productivity gains.To solve bitter disputes over the productivity measure, thecommission offered a compromise: It adopted a plan thatassumes a 3.3% annual productivity increase, but lets phonecompanies opt for 4.3%. Phone companies can switch annually.   Those that sign up for the more rigorous 4.3% adjustmentcan retain a larger share of their earnings. They can earn areturn of 13.25% on their investment before splitting furtherprofits 50-50 with customers. After reaching 17.25%, allprofits will be returned to customers. With the 3.3% factor,phone companies start sharing profits with customers whentheir return reaches 12.25%, and earnings above 16.25% willbe returned to customers.</TEXT></DOC>
