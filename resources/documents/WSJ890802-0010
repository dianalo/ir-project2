The appeal to the Arizona Corporation Commission, announced late yesterday, apparently reverses an earlier statement by a Pinnacle West spokesman that the company wouldn't challenge the temporary order. The spokesman declined at the time to say whether Pinnacle West would challenge a proposed permanent order, for which hearings are scheduled Aug. 28.    The regulatory order limits to $52.7 million -- the amount paid on June 1 -- the quarterly dividend that Arizona Public Service may pay Pinnacle West. The next scheduled dividend date is Sept. 1.    The unusual regulatory action arose because federal regulators ordered Pinnacle West's troubled MeraBank thrift unit to boost its capital by $192 million, effective this past Monday, to shore up a weakening balance sheet. While that deadline apparently hasn't been met, a spokesman for Pinnacle West declined to confirm or comment on the failure.    As in the past, Pinnacle West said it has no plans to use money from Arizona Public Service to subsidize any of its troubled non-utility units. However, the company's chairman, Keith L. Turley, said &quot;we firmly believe the Arizona Corporation Commission has no legal authority to issue such an order.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
