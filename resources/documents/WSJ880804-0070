Summations will begin next week, and the jury may begin deliberating as early as next Thursday.    The trial began on Feb. 24, seven years after Minpeco S.A. filed its suit claiming it was damaged by the Hunts' alleged scheme of hoarding silver bullion in 1979 and 1980 to drive up the price.    Minpeco, represented by the Washington law firm of Cole, Corette andamp; Abrutyn, contends the Hunts committed fraud and violated commodity and antitrust laws as well as federal racketeering laws.    The Hunts maintain that their silver investments were a hedge against inflation, that world events triggered wild fluctuations in prices, and that Minpeco is looking for a scapegoat on which to blame losses it incurred. The Hunts are represented by the New York law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays andamp; Handler. </TEXT></DOC>
