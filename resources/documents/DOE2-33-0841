After constant infusionof the nuclide from a generator in the cubital vein the activity's progressover the right ventricle during the registered heart cycles is presentedwith the help of a gamma camera and a connecting data processor in theform of a time-activity curve, which sums up the pictures correspondingto the maxima and minima of the curve and so calculates an end diastolic,respectively end systolic, summation picture. As a result of the shorthalf-life of Kr-81m (13'') and several data acquisitions a high impulsedensity is attained. The mathematical algorithm determines the contourof the right ventricle objectively and presents its morphology in bothphases of the heart cycle. The ejection fraction can be calculated outof 'regions of interest'. The right ventricular ejection fraction wascalculated on 35 patients and 16 control persons. The procedure withthe Kr-81m proved itself in comparison to the one with Tc-99m bonds asobjective, and included spatial and timely information with considerationof the cyclical information of the object size in the evaluation. Thepathophysiological importance of the right ventricular objection fractionand its changes can be studied and the diagnostic possibilities withcardiopulmonary diseases can be expanded.
