Just consider thelast time Syracuse met a No. 1 team: The Orangemen beat Nebraska 17-9 in1984.;   If Florida State prevails, it will be the first time in five triesthat the Seminoles have won after going 4-0. Over the past two seasons, theSeminoles have won 10 straight games.;   Florida State quarterback CaseyWeldon is expected to be at full strength for the game, after being hinderedin practice by a hip bruise. Weldon has completed 69.6 percent of his passesfor 896 yards and 10 touchdowns.;   Syracuse quarterback Marvin Graves hascompleted 67 percent of his passes for 873 yards and five touchdowns.;   No. 2Miami (3-0) is marching toward its Nov. 16 showdown with Florida State.;  When Miami Coach Dennis Erickson says Oklahoma State is &quot;a lot better than its0-3 record,&quot; he might be right without even meaning it.;   Two of the Cowboys'three losses -- to Tulsa and Texas Christian -- came by a total of ninepoints, and they had five turnovers in a lopsided loss to Arizona State.;  Oklahoma State Coach Pat Jones knows sloppiness will not make it against theHurricanes.;   &quot;If you turn the ball over to them or get into an up-tempo typegame, you're going to get hammered,&quot; he said. &quot;Hopefully the thing will bounceour way a couple of times. We've had more of our ration of unusual thingsoccur.&quot;;   The Cowboys have used three freshman at tailback and are averagingonly 95 yards per game rushing, compared with 215 last season.;   Miamiquarterback Gino Torretta is averaging 18.7 yards per completion, but he andErickson would also like to see more yards on the ground.;   &quot;We have to startestablishing a better running game,&quot; Torretta said.;   No. 9 Iowa (3-0) islooking at its first real test of the season against No. 7 Michigan (2-1). TheWolverines are looking at their third or fourth.;   Michigan built its 2-1mark with victories over Boston College (35-13) and No. 8 Notre Dame (24-14)before losing last week to Florida State (51-31).;   &quot;We've had big games, andwe've had more experience in preparing for big games,&quot; Michigan Coach GaryMoeller said. &quot;But I don't know if that will do us any good against Iowa. I'msure Iowa has been aiming for us.&quot;;   No. 5 Oklahoma (3-0) is showing a morebalanced offensive look this season, and that worries Iowa State Coach JimWalden. The Sooners finally have a throwing quarterback in Cale Gundy, who seta school record last week with 18 completions.;   &quot;It used to be theycomplemented the run with more runs,&quot; Walden said. &quot;Now they complement therun with the pass. That makes it tougher for your defense.&quot;;   The Cyclones(2-2) beat Oklahoma 33-31 in Norman, Okla., last season.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911005  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  558  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, October 5, 199100279191,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
