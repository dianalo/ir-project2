DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Alfred A. Checchi, who headed a group thatacquired the parent of Northwest Airlines Inc., says the fear thatdebt-financed airline takeovers sacrifice safety is ``misleading.''   Testifying before a House panel Tuesday, the Los Angelesinvestor said ``a well-maintained fleet is in fact a far morecost-effective fleet to operate.''   His testimony came before a subcommittee of the House Ways andMeans Committee that is looking into the tax policy aspects ofmergers, acquisitions and leveraged buyouts in the airline industry.   Earlier in the day, senior Transportation and Treasurydepartment officials told a House panel that proposed legislationto restrict airline takeovers wouldn't be good for the industry orthe country.   Checchi added that every deal is different and oneacross-the-board rule would be ``naive and short-sighted.''   He said that ``the kind of person who would _ if he could _ cutback on maintenance procedures to save money would do thisirrespective of what his company's capital structure might be.''   Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of the oversightsubcomittee, said the panel was looking into whether ``taxprovisions have made the airlines more desirable and moresusceptible to takeover activity.''   To combat that, another subcommittee member, Rep. Byron L.Dorgan, D-N.D., introduced legislation that would prohibit airlinespurchased in leveraged buyouts from deducting interest paymentsfrom their taxes.   Last week, a House committee voted to give the TransportationDepartment the authority to block a major airline takeover if itwould jeopardize safety, hinder the company's ability to compete orput it in the hands of a foreign carrier.   But a top Transportation Department official said the agency``neither needs nor wants such authority.''   Patrick V. Murphy Jr., deputy assistant secretary oftransportation for policy and international affairs, said thedepartment ``would object strongly to any legislation that mightinappropriately interfere with the free flow of capital in theairline industry or with allowing the dynamics of the marketplaceto determine the capital structure of airlines.''   Murphy said his boss, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner,has told Congress that senior advisers ``will recommend to thepresident that he veto any such legislation.''   Another government official, John G. Wilkins, said the TreasuryDepartment opposes ``any legislative attempt to single out andaddress concerns regarding leveraged buyouts in a specificindustry.''   ``The tax code is generally too blunt an instrument to drawdistinctions between good and bad debt or between good and badLBOs,'' said Wilkins, a senior economic adviser in the Treasury'sOffice of Tax Policy.   He added that his department does not favor ``special income-taxrules for airlines or for any other specific industry.''   In his testimony, Checchi said the $4 billion takeover of NWAInc., the parent of Northwest, was not motivated by tax factors.   ``If the tax treatment of debt had been changed to make theafter-tax cost of interest greater, I do not necessarily feel thatthis would have discouraged the acquisition of Northwest,'' hesaid. ``The fundamental attractiveness of Northwest as a businesswould remain unchanged.''   Checchi also said that while KLM Royal Dutch Airlines was partof the group that bought NWA, ``We ceded no control of Northwest toKLM.''   He noted that KLM got only 5 percent of the voting stock and oneout of 12 seats on the board of directors.   ``Each acquisition and acquirer should be evaluatedindividually,'' he told the panel.</TEXT></DOC>
