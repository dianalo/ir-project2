In August 1982, Mexico triggered the crisis by becoming the first Latin American country to run out of available reserves. Now it is the first major debtor to get U.S. government backing for a plan designed to reduce its government bank debt, which totals $53 billion.    Mexico has been able to win new concessions from its creditors because, unlike most other major debtor countries, it has generally followed an orthodox economic path. It has negotiated economic programs with the International Monetary Fund and generally made payments to creditors on time. Over the past two years, it has made considerable attempts to restructure its economy by removing tariffs and taxes on imports and allowing its currency to find its own value.    Geography also is a factor. Mexico's special status as a debtor is &quot;hardly surprising, considering its strategic importance to the U.S.,&quot; says Norman Bailey, a Washington-based consultant and former member of the National Security Council.    Bankers also say that Mexico's debt negotiators are more professional than many of their counterparts in other debtor nations. Certainly, Angel Gurria, Mexico's director of public credit and the nation's chief foreign-debt negotiator, has been at his job longer than most -- he started in his post before the debt crisis broke.    Those factors help account for the fact that Mexico was the first major debtor after the crisis broke to negotiate a substantial new loan from its bankers, when in 1983 it got them to agree to a $5 billion loan. The following year, it was the first heavily indebted country to win lower interest-rate margins on its foreign bank debt.    Earlier this year, Mexico was the first big Latin American debtor to negotiate maturities of 20 years on its rescheduled debt. And it became the first to negotiate new bank loans that could be drawn upon if the country's growth rate and investment didn't reach agreed levels. Those loans haven't been activated because of the country's modest economic comeback.    Under the new plan devised by Mexico and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., a major lender, creditor banks could exchange their Mexican government debt at a discount for as much as $10 billion of new 20-year Mexican bonds backed by a U.S. Treasury guarantee.    Mexico would pay up to $2 billion to the U.S. Treasury to buy a maximum of $10 billion of 20-year zero-coupon U.S. government bonds, which would be the backing behind the Mexican bonds. At a three-day auction slated for March, creditor banks could swap their debt for the Mexican bonds. Mexico would take all bids up to a certain price.    In other innovations in the international debt crisis, where Mexico went first, other big debtors followed. Thus, if the new plan works, everyone expects Brazil and Argentina will try to copy it. &quot;They're going to have to do it for absolutely everybody,&quot; says Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski, a managing director of First Boston Corp., who recently took part in efforts, so far unsuccessful, to devise a similar program for Brazil.    But if any such plan is to work for Brazil, that country would need to restore order to its public finances and agree on an economic program with the IMF.    Brazil also has yet to fully restore good relations with its foreign bankers. It took a step along that road yesterday when it paid about $1.1 billion in interest arrears to its creditor banks, the first interest payment in more than 10 months on its medium-term and long-term foreign bank debt. Brazil also drew $715 million in bank loans yesterday, the first drawing on $3 billion designed to help the country clear an estimated $4.5 billion in interest arrears on its bank debt.    Moreover, the new Mexican plan relies on the country using up to $2 billion of its foreign-exchange reserves to buy the U.S. Treasury bonds. Brazil has much weaker reserves, and Argentina's government is close to running out of money altogether. &quot;Brazil doesn't have the money and Argentina doesn't have a dime,&quot; says First Boston's Mr. Kuczynski, who argues that new ways should be devised to lend these countries money to pursue a plan similar to Mexico's.    Indeed, the very seriousness of Brazil's and Argentina's economic problems -- particularly high and rising inflation and massive government deficits -- probably prompted the U.S. government to back the new plan for Mexico. It shows that a big debtor can get U.S. government help, and even some debt relief, if it follows the U.S.(approved route of sticking with an IMF program and trying to open up and reform its economy.    &quot;It's a carrot to the other debtors. I suggest it wouldn't have happened if the Brazilian and Argentine situation hadn't been so bad,&quot; says Alan Stoga, senior associate at Kissinger Associates Inc., a New York-based consulting firm. </TEXT></DOC>
