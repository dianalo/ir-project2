(program)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Dear SuperGroup,andM;Boys, boys, boys ...andP;  boys will be boys! Enough already.andP;  I read with mildinterest the article &quot;SuperTip: Creating 4-Up Labels with QUERY&quot; written byVladimir Volokh (SuperGroup Magazine, May/ June 1990) and the subsequentletter to SuperGroup written by Jerry Gailey (SuperGroup Magazine,January/February 199 1).andP;  Obviously Mr. Gailey is correct that the originalarticle documents a process which requires MPEX, which is not free.andP;  Mr.andO;Gailey missed the fact that the user does NOT want the 4-up labels to havethe same vendors listed.andP;  If they did, the user would simply repeat thedetail lines across the page as in:andM;REPORT;NOPAGEandM;D1,CONTACT,22;D1,CONTACT,52;D1, CONTACT,82;D1,CONTACT, 112andM;D2,TITLE,22;D2,TITLE,52;D2,TITLE,82;D2,TIT LE,112andM;etc., etc.andM;Obviously, this does not require a program other than QUERY.andP;  And Vladimir,are you aware that this can be done easily without MPEX? Yes, MPEX andSTREAMX allow for a prompt of the find, and actually do dataset and filelength calculations and file compressions, etc.; however, most of these areunnecessary.andP;  You left the ad hoc database and schema behind you and createda long $STDLIST, wasting many sectors and physical I/Os on the $STDLIST.andO;Also, the method documented has too many file opens and program reruns.andP;  Alltold, you used MPEX, QUERY three times, FCOPY twice, EDITOR and EDIT, besidesthe database utilities.andP;  Besides, your documenting how &quot;this load might failif one of the fields ends with andamp;.&quot; fails to mention that all data isleft-shifted if it contains beginning blanks.andP;  I really don't know why thefield might end with a  andamp;&quot; or why it might have leading blanks, other thanfor indentation.andP;  The following job will produce 4-up labels as originallyintended, one label per record, based upon Vladimir's original schema,without either of the aforementioned problems and without the use of MPEX,STREAMX or any other third-party software.andP;  Viadimir's use of QUERY and &quot;adhoc&quot; databasing, along with FCOPY and EDITOR, is not unique but hopefully iseye-opening to some of the SuperGroup readers.andP;  MPEX serves many usefulpurposes as does SuperGroup.andP;  In this instance, MPEX usage is not absolutelynecessary.andM;By the way, Jerry, since we're keeping count, I also used 49 lines of actualcode including logging on and off, and the labels are six lines per originaldocumentation, not your four.andP;  Lastly, is PROTOS free?
