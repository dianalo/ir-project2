These purchases will be in addition to orders fromconstruction and engineering firms that will use specialtysteels and various metals to rebuild the shattered Gulf.</LP><TEXT>   The key military metal will be cobalt, which is a vitalpart of jet engines and missiles, dealers say. Other metalsused for military equipment include nickel, titanium,tungsten and molybdenum.   While only 36 allied aircraft were lost in action duringthe Gulf war, according to military sources, the allied airforces are likely to repair or replace many more engines,says Oscar Prager, a director of Ayrton andamp; Partners Ltd.,London metals merchants. Allied pilots flew about 100,000 airsorties in the war to liberate Kuwait from Iraq's invasion.   &quot;As much as 900 pounds of cobalt is required for the`superalloys' on blades, vanes, disks, seals and cases ofeach jet engine,&quot; says Jack Johnston, general manager of theCobalt Development Institute, an industry body.   The superalloys, which contain as much as 65% of cobalt,resist excessive heat and corrosion from atmosphere, sea andsand, he says. A smaller proportion of cobalt is combinedwith nickel in other jet engine alloys, Mr. Johnston says,and titanium is an important material for fan and compressorsections. Cobalt is also an essential metal for the magnetsin Patriot missile-guidance systems, he adds.   After shielding Israel, Saudi Arabia and the allied forcesfrom the worst of the Scud missile attacks, Patriot missileswill become a popular item in the world's arsenals, analystssay.   While supplies and inventories of most strategic metalsare more than sufficient to satisfy military requirements,the cobalt market could be affected by the added demand,dealers say.   After encountering tight supplies last summer, the priceof the metal doubled to $16.50 a pound by January this yearand is currently about $13.50. In contrast, prices oftitanium, molybdenum, tungsten and most other strategicmetals are languishing.   Military suppliers could encounter a shortage of cobaltwhen they begin buying metal, dealers say.   &quot;Market sentiment this year will be dominated by Zaire'sproduction flows,&quot; says Nicholas French, a director of WogenResources Ltd, metals dealers. He is concerned that politicaland economic upheaval will pare Zaire's exports of cobalt,which at 26 million pounds normally account for about half ofannual world supplies.   Zaire's cobalt production is well below this year's targetbecause of flooding, maintenance, labor and financialproblems, Mr. French says. Moreover, production in Zambia,the second largest producer, also may fall short ofexpectations, says Mr. Prager of Ayrton andamp; Partners.   &quot;The problems of these politically unstable nations won'tdisappear in a hurry,&quot; Mr. Prager says.   But if any actual cobalt shortages develop, they won'tlast long, industry analysts predict. For one thing, bothZaire and Zambia have in the past tended to overcome problemsand fill orders from customers, analysts say.   For another, the destruction of Kuwait will raise worldsupplies of scrap metal, including cobalt, analysts say.Depending on prices, metals will be recycled on to themarket, says Jim Lennon, an analyst at Commodities ResearchUnit in London.   Moreover, the increased demand for cobalt to replenishmilitary hardware and rebuild Kuwait's oil industry comesjust as industrial demand has slackened because of theworld-wide economic slowdown. That is why cobalt's price hasdeclined from recent peaks, dealers say.   The commercial aircraft industry is depressed, sostepped-up metals orders from military aircraft and missilemakers won't compete with civilian needs, an analyst says.   The U.S. government also holds a 53 million-pound cobaltinventory, equal to about 14 months of world consumption,analysts say. It is there for defense purposes and isincluded with 91 other commodities in a $10 billion stockpileas an insurance against political or other disruptions.   Reflecting the metal's importance, the administration isupgrading the quality of cobalt in its stockpile, aimingeventually to raise inventories to around 83 million pounds,dealers say.   &quot;If there's a shortage of cobalt, it is likely thatmilitary users will buy cobalt from the U.S. government,&quot; onedealer said.   Regardless of whether its price rises in coming months,the allies undoubtedly consider cobalt a peculiarly&quot;precious&quot; metal of the Mideast conflict. Because he failedin his attempts to obtain cobalt parts to enrich uranium,Saddam Hussein couldn't build a nuclear bomb, Mr. Johnston ofthe Cobalt Development Council says.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:   Energy                                                                                                          Crude oil futures trading will likely continue to reflectthe new-found buoyancy of petroleum prices.   Oil prices were widely expected to plummet with the end ofthe war in the Persian Gulf. Last week, however, prices onthe New York Mercantile Exchange rose.   Many market players attribute the unexpected firmness tothe discovery that damage to the oil industry infrastructurein Iraq and Kuwait won't allow significant oil production orproduct refining for several months. Over the weekend, a waveof firsthand assessments of the destruction seemed to confirmthat timetable.   Oil traders will take special note of this week'sinventory report, due late Tuesday, from the AmericanPetroleum Institute to see whether domestic stocks of crudeoil and products continue to decrease. The Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries will meet March 11 in Geneva,and traders this week will begin to anticipate theorganization's production plans.                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          Analysts said they would be watching to see if last week'srally triggered by the U.S. and allied victory in the PersianGulf war would continue unabated today. Wheat and soybeanfutures prices soared Friday as trend-following commodityfunds sent streams of buy orders into the trading pits forthose contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade, analysts said.The markets are being propelled by traders' hopes that theU.S. will grant a raft of export credits for allies and othercountries perceived as friendly toward U.S. policy in theMideast. &quot;We haven't seen this kind of widespread buyingsince the falling of the Berlin Wall in late '89,&quot; whichprompted hopes for a neo-Marshall Plan to rebuild and feednewly liberated Eastern Europe, an analyst said. Thecomparison is telling; the surge in export business expectedafter the Berlin Wall fell existed mainly in traders'imaginations. Commodity prices retreated once it becameapparent that budgetary restraints in this country, amongother things, blocked a new wave of export guarantees. Whatis more, soybean exports so far this year are running wellbehind last year's level, noted Joel Karlin, a futuresanalyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago. Whenit comes to exports, &quot;conjecture is getting ahead ofreality,&quot; he said. Continued dry conditions in Braziliansoybean-growing regions and the wheat-producing areas of theGreat Plains in this country also are supporting futuresprices. Rain over the weekend in either or both regions couldquickly send prices lower, analysts said. &quot;People forget thatwe had a dry January and February last year, too, then we hadplenty of rain in March, April and May,&quot; Mr. Karlin added. OnFriday, soybean futures for March delivery gained 11 cents abushel to close at $5.8675, while wheat futures added 9.25cents a bushel to close at $2.69 a bushel. Corn futuresrallied in step with the other contracts, gaining 2.75 centsa bushel to close at $2.44 a bushel.                                                                                                          Precious Metals                                                                                                          Although last week's rally stalled on Friday, analystswere encouraged that prices held up well under profit-taking.Gold for April delivery ended at $368.60, down 40 cents.After trading lower earlier in the day, April platinumfinished 70 cents an ounce higher at $406.40, a nearly $30rise since Tuesday. And May silver gained 4.5 cents an ounceto end at $3.818.   &quot;The fact that prices held is impressive, and indicatesthat we have a much better market psychology than we've hadin a long time,&quot; said William O'Neill, futures strategist atMerrill Lynch.   &quot;There's very good support coming into the {gold} marketnow,&quot; particularly from the investors in the Middle East,said Ian MacDonald, vice president of precious metals atCredit Suisse. The Middle East will be unsettled for sometime to come, he said, and individuals, hearing reports ofdesperate Kuwaitis under Iraqi occupation selling televisionsets and other property to buy food, are stocking up on smallgold bars.   Silver is beginning to show some life, although it is tooearly to say its troubles are over, said Mr. O'Neill, whothinks the rally will be short-term.   Mr. MacDonald said some industrial demand, particularlyout of Italy's jewelry and flatware industries, is startingto pick up. But, he cautioned, it will take many months ofindustrial demand &quot;to get the market out of the woods.&quot;   Mr. O'Neill expects the three metals to continue to riseearly this week. Mr. MacDonald sees gold trading above $360and perhaps as high as $375. But, he added, he doesn't see abull market developing for gold. The $400 level seems to be aformidable psychological barrier, he said.                                                                                                          Sugar                                                                                                          Futures prices, which strengthened most of last week, roseagain on Friday. Sugar for May delivery ended 0.4 cent higherat 9.18 cents.   The market was encouraged by large deliveries that weretaken against the March contract on Thursday, said JudithGanes, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Speculation circulated inthe market that a large U.S. trade house took delivery of255,000 metric tons on Thursday to make up for commitmentsthat weren't met by a troubled London trade house, she said.   Sugar prices were also swept along with the rallies ingrains and other commodities, Ms. Ganes added, and whathappens this week will depend in large measure on how wellthe other markets perform. The sugar market's underlyingsupply and demand situation remains weak, she said.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          JOEL KARLIN is a futures analyst at Research DepartmentInc. in Chicago.
