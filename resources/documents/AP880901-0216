Although such a shift in employment patterns has been occurringsince the end of World War II, its acceleration this decade hascreated an ``unprecedented drag on pay growth,'' said the reportprepared by University of Massachusetts economist Robert Costrell.   In the 1950s, pay and benefits for workers in expandingindustries averaged $6,133 a year below those in contractingbusinesses, as measured in 1987 dollars. The gap narrowed to $647 ayear in the 1960s, widening slightly to $811 in the 1970s, thereport said.   But this decade it has increased more than tenfold.   In the 1981-87 period, during the Reagan administration, jobs inexpanding sectors of the economy paid an average of $21,983 a year_ $19,154 in wages plus $2,829 in health, pension and otherbenefits, including employer contributions to Social Security, thereport said.   However, that is $10,404 a year below the average compensationof workers in retreating industries, where the average wage was$26,193 plus $6,194 in benefits, or a total of $32,387.   Only part of the gap is due to difference in hourly wage rates,about $3.08, according to the report.   Another factor is that the jobs in manufacturing and otherretreating industries usually offered overtime opportunities withan average workweek of 40.4 hours. Jobs in the expanding areas ofthe economy had an average workweek of only 32.7 hours, the reportsaid.   The committee's chairman, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes, D-Md., said thestudy reflects ``serious setbacks experienced by exporting andimport-competing industries in a prolonged period of policyindifference.''   Republicans were quick to criticize the report, with Sen.William Roth, R-Del., calling it ``Creative Economic Analysis 101.''   ``It should come as no surprise that, in this election season,the author of this study is from Massachusetts, the home state ofthe liberals' favorite presidential candidate,'' Democratic Gov.Michael Dukakis, Roth said.   ``By concentrating on 1981-87, Mr. Costrell includes therecession year of 1982 during which unemployment rose dramaticallybut excludes the gains in employment made thus far in 1988.''   Costrell acknowledged that the report does not include data fromthis year, with its strong rebound in manufacturing employment.   But he said he found two turning points in labor market shiftsin the past: 1973 when energy prices jumped and 1981 when U.S.trade deficits began emerging and energy prices started falling,reversing the pattern of the 1970s.   ``It's possible that analysis of this sort a few years hencewill discern another turning point around 1987 if recent tradegains continue and energy prices start rising again,'' Costrellsaid.   He said the effect of jobs shifting more rapidly fromhigher-paying to lower-paying industries this decade has ``retardedthe recovery of real wage growth from the slowdown of the '70s.''   After adjustments for inflation, the average real compensationof workers this decade has grown about one-half percent or anaverage $126 annually, still ahead of increases averaging less than$100 a year in the 1970s. But it would have grown a full percentagepoint or about $239 per year had there been no shift in employment,the report said.   ``Much of this shift effect may represent the losses of theyounger generation who are unable to enter or move up to the jobsof their retiring parents,'' Costrell said.   Not all of the shifts have been negative. For example, thereport noted that the low-paying apparel and textile industry andprivate household services contracted sharply this decade whilefinancial brokerage firms with high-paying jobs expanded rapidly,at least up until the stock market crash last October.</TEXT></DOC>
