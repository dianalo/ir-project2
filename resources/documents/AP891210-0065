O'Connor to interrupt his sermon while policecarried protesters out on stretchers.   More than 4,500 demonstrators marched outside, along a stretchof Fifth Avenue normally crowded with shoppers and sightseers,chanting ``Teach safe sex'' and ``Just say no is not enough.''   Police said 111 people were arrested.   Gay activists have staged a variety of actions at St. Patrick'ssince 1987, when O'Connor barred a gay Roman Catholic group,Dignity, from using church facilities for meetings.   Church officials, anticipating the well-publicizeddemonstration, took the unusual step of clearing the church afterthe 9 a.m. Mass, then searching the bags of everyone entering forthe 10:15 a.m. Mass.   The cathedral doors were locked a few minutes after Massstarted, said archdiocese spokesman Joe Zwilling. Police werestationed all around the massive cathedral, including at the railin front of the altar.   Police said 43 people were arrested inside the packed cathedralwhen they jumped from their seats near the start of O'Connor'shomily and stretched out in the center aisle, some chainingthemselves to pews.   O'Connor was forced to distribute copies of his sermon ratherthan read it, and he asked the congregation to stand and join himin reciting prayers to drown out protesters' chants.   He continued the Mass while dozens of uniformed and plainclothespolice walked up and down the aisle, ferrying the protesters out onbright orange stretchers.   Police Sgt. Peter Sweeney said 68 were arrested outside, whereprotesters marched with signs such as ``Curb Your Dogma'' and``Pope John Paul for Ayatollah.''   In 1988, two months after 11 silent protesters were arrestedinside the cathedral, a state judge issued an injunction barringdemonstrations inside.   Those arrested Sunday were charged with disorderly conduct andtrespassing, Sweeney said. Some also were charged with resistingarrest.   The protest was organized by the AIDS Coalition to UnleashPower, or ACT UP, and Women's Health Action and Mobilization orWHAM!   ``ACT UP and WHAM! both have a history of forceful, louddemonstrations,'' organizer Victor Mendolia said. ``We demand tobring our issues to the cardinal directly and that's what we did.''   They criticized O'Connor for his opposition to abortion and hisvocal support of Operation Rescue, a group that stages blockadesand sit-ins at abortion clinics nationwide; for lobbying againsteducation about safer sex and condoms, especially in schools; andfor his opposition to gay rights legislation.   At the end of the Mass, O'Connor praised the congregants forshowing restraint and said the protest left him anguished.   ``The archbishop of New York must of course always preach whatthe church preaches, teach what the church teaches,'' O'Connorsaid. ``I cannot believe that anyone, even those who hate what thechurch teaches, would respect me for a moment if I taught anythingelse.''</TEXT></DOC>
