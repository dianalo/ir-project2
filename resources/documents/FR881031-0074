The MOU is designed to ensure that there will be no gapsin the protection of workers at NRC-licensed facilities where the OSHAalso has health and safety jurisdiction. At the same time, the MOU is designedto avoid duplication of effort on the part of the two agencies in thosecases where it is not always practical to sharply identify boundaries betweenthe NRC's responsibilities for nuclear safety and the OSHA's responsibilitiesfor industrial safety. The MOU, which replaces an existing procedure for interagency activities,defines the general areas of responsibilities of both agencies, describesgenerally the efforts of each to achieve worker protection at NRC-licensedfacilities, and provides general procedures for the coordination of interfaceactivities and exchange of information between the NRC and OSHA. The textof the MOU is set out below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose and Background</ITAG>1. The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. NuclearRegulatory Commission (NRC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) is to delineate the general areas of responsibility of each agency;to describe generally the efforts of the agencies to achieve worker protectionat facilities licensed by the NRC; and to provide guidelines for coordinationof interface activities between the two agencies. If NRC licenses observeOSHA's standards and regulations, this will help minimize workplace hazards.2. Both NRC and OSHA have jurisdiction over occupational safety and healthat NRC-licensed facilities. Because it is not always practical to sharplyidentify boundaries between the nuclear and radiological safety NRC regulatesand the industrial safety OSHA regulates, a coordinated interagency effortcan ensure against gaps in the protection of workers and at the same time,avoid duplication of effort. This memorandum replaces an existing procedurefor interagency activities, ``General Guidelines for Interface Activitiesbetween the NRC Regional Offices and the OSHA.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Hazards Associated With Nuclear Facilities</ITAG>3. There are four kinds of hazards that may be associated with NRC-licensednuclear facilities:a. Radiation risk produced by radioactive materials;b. Chemical risk produced by radioactive materials;c. Plant conditions which affect the safety of radioactive materials andthus present an increased radiation risk to workers. For example, thesemight produce a fire or an explosion, and thereby cause a release of radioactivematerials or an unsafe reactor condition; and, d. Plant conditions which result in an occupational risk, but do not affectthe safety of licensed radioactive materials. For example, there mightbe exposure to toxic nonradioactive materials and other industrial hazardsin the workplace. Generally, NRC covers the first three hazards listed in paragraph 3 (a,b, and c), and OSHA covers the fourth hazard described in paragraph 3 (d).NRC and OSHA responsibilities and actions are described more fully in paragraphs4 and 5 below. <ITAG tagnum="84">NRC Responsibilities </ITAG>4. NRC is responsible for licensing and regulating nuclear facilities andmaterials and for conducting research in support of the licensing and regulatoryprocess, as mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; theEnergy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and the Nuclear NonproliferationAct of 1978; and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, as amended, and other applicable statutes. These NRC responsibilitiescover the first three nuclear facility hazards identified in paragraph3 (a, b, c). NRC does not have statutory authority for the fourth hazarddescribed in paragraph 3 (d). NRC responsibilities include protecting public health and safety; protectingthe environment; protecting and safeguarding materials and plants in theinterest of national security; and assuring conformity with antitrust lawsfor certain types of facilities, e.g., nuclear power reactors. Agency functionsare performed through: Standards-setting and rulemaking; technical reviewsand studies; conduct of public hearings; issuance of authorizations, permitsand licenses; inspection, investigation and enforcement; evaluation ofoperating experience, and confirmatory research. <ITAG tagnum="84">OSHA Responsibilities</ITAG>5. OSHA is responsible for administering the requirements established underthe Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA Act) (29 U.S.C. 651 <T3>et seq.</T3>), which was enacted in 1970. OSHA's authority to engagein the kinds of activities described below does not apply to those workplacesafety and health conditions for which other Federal agencies exercisestatutory authority to prescribe and enforce standards, rules or regulations.Under the OSH Act, every employer has a general duty to furnish each employeewith a place of employment that is free from recognized hazards that cancause death or serious physical harm and to comply with all OSHA standards,rules, and regulations.OSHA standards contain requirements designed to protect employees againstworkplace hazards. In general, safety standards are intended to protectagainst traumatic injury, while health standards are designed to addresspotential overexposure to toxic substances and harmful physical agents,and protect against illnesses which do not manifest themselves for manyyears after initial exposure.OSHA standards cover employee exposures from all radiation sources notregulated by NRC. Examples include x-ray equipment, accelerators, accelerator-producedmaterials, electron microscopes and betatrons, and naturally occurringradioactive materials such as radium.It is estimated that the Act covers nearly 6 million workplaces employingmore than 80 million workers. Federal OSHA covers approximately three-fifths,or four million, of these workplaces. States which operate OSHA-approvedjob safety and health programs, or ``Plans,'' cover the remainder.OSHA State Plan States are encouraged, but not required, to delineate theirauthority for occupational safety and health at NRC-licensed facilitiesin the same manner as Federal OSHA.The OSHA areas of responsibility described in this memorandum are subjectto all applicable requirements and authorities of the OSH Act. However,the industrial safety record at NRC-licensed nuclear power plants is suchthat OSHA inspections at these facilities are conducted normally as a resultof accidents, fatalities, referrals, or worker complaints.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interface Procedures</ITAG>6. In recognition of the agencies' authorities and responsibilities enumeratedabove, the following procedures will be followed:Although NRC does not conduct inspections of industrial safety, in thecourse of inspections of radiological and nuclear safety, NRC personnelmay identify safety concerns within the area of OSHA responsibility ormay receive complaints from an employee about OSHA-covered working conditions.In such instances, NRC will bring the matter to the attention of licenseemanagement. NRC inspectors are not to perform the role of OSHA inspectors;however, they are to elevate OSHA safety issues to the attention of NRCRegional management when appropriate. If significant safety concerns areidentified or if the licensee demonstrates a pattern of unresponsivenessto identified concerns, the NRC Regional Office will inform the appropriateOSHA Regional Office. In the case of complaints, NRC will withhold, fromthe licensee, the identity of the employee. In addition, when known toNRC, NRC will encourage licensees to report to OSHA accidents resultingin a fatality or multiple hospitalizations.When such instances occur within OSHA State Plan States' jurisdiction,the OSHA Regional Office will refer the matter to the State for appropriateaction.7. OSHA Regional Offices will inform the appropriate NRC Regional Officeof matters which are in the purview of NRC, when these come to their attentionduring Federal or State safety and health inspections or through complaints.The following are examples of matters that would be reported to the NRC:a. Lax security control or work practices that would affect nuclear orradiological health and safety.b. Improper posting of radiation areas.c. Licensee employee allegations of NRC license or regulation violations.8. The NRC and OSHA need not normally conduct joint inspections at NRC-licensedfacilities. However, under certain conditions, such as investigations orinspections following accidents or resulting from reported activities asdiscussed in items 6 and 7 above, it may be mutually agreed on a case-by-casebasis that joint investigations are in the public interest.9. The chemical processing of nuclear materials at some NRC-licensed fueland materials facilities presents chemical and nuclear operational safetyhazards which can best be evaluated by joint NRC-OSHA team assessments.Each agency will make its best efforts to support such assessments at about20 facilities once every five years. Of these facilities, about one-thirdare in the OSHA Plan States. OSHA will also assist in promoting such participationby State personnel in OSHA Plan States.10. Based upon reports of injury or complaints at nuclear power plant sites,OSHA will provide NRC with information on those sites where increased managementattention to worker safety is needed. The NRC will bring such informationindicating significant breakdown in worker safety to the attention of licenseemanagement and monitor corrective actions. This will not interfere withOSHA authority and responsibility to investigate industrial accidents andworker complaints.11. Power reactor sites are inspected by NRC Region-based and ResidentInspectors. Personnel from NRC Regional Offices routinely conduct inspectionsat most fuel and materials licensed facilities. In order to enhance theability of NRC personnel to identify safety matters under OSHA purviewduring nuclear and radiological safety inspections, OSHA will provide NRCRegional personnel with basic chemical and industrial safety training andindoctrination in OSHA safety standards, consistent with ongoing OSHA trainingprograms. To enhance the ability of OSHA and State Plan personnel to effectivelyparticipate in the Operational Safety Team Assessments, NRC will providetraining in basic radiation safety requirements, consistent with ongoingNRC training programs. Details of such training will be as mutually agreedby the NRC Technical Training Center and the OSHA National Training Institute.12. Resolution of policy issues concerning agency jurisdiction and operationalrelations will be coordinated by the NRC Deputy Executive Director forOperations, and by the OSHA Director of Policy. Appropriate Headquarterspoints of contact will be established.13. Resolution of issues concerning inspection and enforcement activitiesinvolving both NRC and OSHA jurisdiction at NRC-licensed facilities willbe handled between NRC's Office of Enforcement and OSHA's Directorate ofCompliance Programs. Each NRC and OSHA Regional Office will designate pointsof contact for carrying out interface activities.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Victor Stello, Jr., </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Executive Director for Operations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">October 21, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John A.
