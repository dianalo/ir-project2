Union Carbide said the remaining sale of certain international portions of the pesticides business is still subject to some governmental approvals.

Litigation over damages stemming from a December 1984 chemical leak at the Bhopal, India, plant is still pending.    Carbide's agricultural chemical business employs about 3,600 people; its 1985 agricultural chemical sales totaled about $450 million. Carbide had total sales of $9 billion last year. </TEXT></DOC>
