(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Pennsylvania couple is asking a Floridajudge to order a genetic blood test to determine if a 9-year-oldSarasota girl is theirs.   The girl who Ernest and Regina Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., suspectis their daughter is living in a broken home without ``an ongoing,stable home environment,'' the couple said in a motion filed Mondayin Sarasota Circuit Court.   The Twiggs charged in court papers that the girl's father``wrongfully retains custody'' and has failed to provide a caringhome.   In response, a lawyer representing the girl's father contendsthe Twiggs intend to ``disrupt the happiness and well-being'' ofthe child.   The search for the child the Twiggs maintain was kidnapped atbirth and switched in a tiny Central Florida hospital nursery tooka bitter turn with the latest motion, said Arthur Ginsburg, whorepresents the girl's father.   ``We went to them with an olive branch, and they came to us witha sword. They really don't know anything about this father anddaughter; he has a deep love for his child,'' Ginsburg said.   Sarasota Circuit Judge Andy Owens has agreed to schedule anemergency hearing Friday to consider a request for court-orderedgenetic testing designed to determine the girl's biological parents.   The father insists the child does not belong to the other couple.   Neither side has identified the Sarasota girl or her relativesto protect her privacy.   The Twiggs say they left Hardee Memorial Hospital in 1978 with asickly child who they subsequently learned was not their own. Theyhave filed a $100 million lawsuit in federal court in Tampaclaiming that the hospital swapped their healthy girl for one withheart problems in order to facilitate an adoption.   The Twiggs discovered this summer through genetic blood teststhat the baby they named Arlena was not their daughter, but nevertold her before her death on Aug. 23.   The couple suspect their daughter is the Sarasota girl, ablue-eyed blonde who was the only other white child reported tohave shared the hospital nursery with baby Arlena.   The father consented to genetic testing to put the matter torest, but both sides never agreed on conditions _ the legal fatherwanted to choose the facility and keep the results confidential _so voluntary testing is off, attorneys said.</TEXT></DOC>
