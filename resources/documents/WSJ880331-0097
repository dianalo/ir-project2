But the official, Kang Won Il, said Chun Kyung Hwan, 46 years old, had denied during questioning that he peddled influence or hid funds abroad as head of the semi-official Saemaul rural-development agency during his brother's presidency.    Prosecutors allege that the younger Chun used his position to divert government and private donations, sell influence and pressure businesses to make gifts to him of money, land and stocks. They allege Mr. Chun embezzled $9.3 million.    In what has become a politically sensitive scandal, about 200 Saemaul and government officials have been questioned about corruption or a cover-up to protect former President Chun and his family. Five other suspects have been charged with embezzlement and fraudulent land sales, including two top Saemaul officials and brothers-in-law of the younger Chun.    Former President Chun, who hasn't been implicated in the Saemaul scandal, appointed his brother to head the agency after he came to power in a 1980 coup. Opposition politicians in Seoul are demanding that the former president return to Seoul from a private visit to the U.S., during which he has met with President Reagan and received other U.S. officials, including Secretary of State George Shultz, at a Korean Embassy function.    Korean officials said last week that Mr. Chun was returning to Korea. But a State Department spokesman said in Washington it understood Mr. Chun was only cutting one week off his planned one-month visit, which would make his departure date around April 12. </TEXT></DOC>
