American businesses outside the farm sector added 169,000 new workers to their payrolls last month, with gains in construction, manufacturing and service industries, the Labor Department reported. The department also made a huge revision to its calculation of job growth for June. Employers added 250,000 new employees during the month, it said, many more than the 180,000 originally estimated.    The nation's civilian unemployment rate declined 0.1 percentage point in July, to 5.2%, holding the jobless rate in a range that hasn't been seen since the mid-1970s.    &quot;It clearly allays fears of a recession,&quot; said Robert Giordano, co-director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. in New York.    &quot;There was very little that was bearish in this report,&quot; added Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.    Nevertheless, the latest employment numbers are another conclusive piece of evidence that the economy is slowing. The growth in employment, while impressive in a time of slowing production and demand, is still considerably below the monthly average employment gain of last year.    &quot;The slowdown is still intact, but the character of it has changed,&quot; Mr. Giordano said. &quot;It is now less alarming and a more gradual slowdown.&quot;    Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co., added, &quot;The economy looks stronger coming into the third quarter than when it ended the second quarter.&quot; But he emphasized: &quot;The economy is not strong, but stronger.&quot;    The economy has been weakening as the result of Federal Reserve efforts between March 1988 and March 1989 to head off inflation by pushing up interest rates. Recently the Fed allowed a key interest rate to decline, but some analysts have worried that it acted too late to keep the economy from tipping into a recession.    Even after the employment numbers were released Friday, Roger Brinner, director of economic forecasting at DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass., said: &quot;I think this is consistent with the notion that we're in a growth recession. It will seem like a growth economy for people finding a job and a recession for people who can't.&quot;    But Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser, told reporters at a White House briefing: &quot;We believe the economy is growing on a modest, sustainable path that will lead to continued job creation. We believe that it's consistent with controlling and eventually reducing inflation; and therefore we believe the Federal Reserve's tough task of making sure the economy continues to grow, while making sure inflation doesn't accelerate, will be achievable.&quot;    Inflation remains an issue. After two months of restrained growth, hourly earnings jumped 0.8% in July, suggesting that tight labor markets are driving up business costs, which could translate into higher prices for goods and services. On the other hand the result is increased income for American workers, which could add some more spark to the sluggish economy.    This is the third month in a row that the Labor Department has substantially revised upward its estimate of the increase in business payrolls, a figure that is followed intensely by financial markets because it influences Federal Reserve policy.    The initial Labor Department figures are based on reports from about half of the 335,000 employers surveyed by the government; the figures are revised later when more reports are received. June figures often change substantially because so much summer hiring occurs during that month. &quot;You get your largest revisions when there's a lot of hiring and firing,&quot; said Lois Plunkert, a Labor Department analyst.    The May revision, however, baffles the department's experts. &quot;It was just a fluke,&quot; said Ms. Plunkert. She attributed the April revision to a change in the seasonal adjustment factors used between the initial and subsequent report.    Here are excerpts from the Labor Department's employment report. The figures are seasonally adjusted. @ JULY JUNE @ 1989 1989 @ (millions of persons) @ Total labor force ........... 125.6 125.8 @ Total employment .......... 119.1 119.2 @ Civilian labor force ........ 124.0 124.1 @ Civilian employment ....... 117.5 117.5 @ Unemployment .............. 6.5 6.6 @ Payroll employment .......... 108.7 108.6 @ Unemployment: (percent of labor force) @ All workers ................. 5.2 5.2 @ All civilian workers ........ 5.2 5.3 @ Adult men ................. 4.3 4.3 @ Adult women ............... 5.0 4.9 @ Teen-agers ................ 14.7 15.6 @ White ..................... 4.6 4.5 @ Black ..................... 10.9 11.9 @ Black teen-agers .......... 27.4 36.5 @ Hispanic .................. 9.0 8.1 @ Average weekly hours: (hours of work) @ Total private nonfarm ....... 34.9 34.6 @ Manufacturing ............. 41.0 41.0 @ Factory overtime .......... 3.9 3.8 </TEXT></DOC>
