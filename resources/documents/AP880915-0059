Speaking to reporters Wednesday after a five-hour inspectionflight over the island, he estimated damage at $8 billion and saidone out of every five homes was destroyed.   State-run Jamaican Broadcasting Corp., operating by generator,said at least 19 people were killed when the storm whipped acrossthe island on Monday.   The hurricane, the most intense on record, also killed fivepeople in the Dominican Republic on its sweep westward through theCaribbean before slamming into Mexico's Yucatan peninsula Wednesdaywith 160 mph winds.   The Jamaican Embassy in Washington said 500,000 of Jamaica's 2.3million people were rendered homeless, and the government estimatedthat about 150,000 people were in distress shelters set up aroundthe island in sports stadiums, churches, government buildings andmovie theaters.   In the Dominican Republic, officials reported widespread cropdamage. The country's main electricity relay station remained outof service Wednesday, leaving half the capital of Santo Domingowithout power.   Heavy crop damage also was reported in the islands of St. Lucia,Guadeloupe and St. Vincent.   Seaga told reporters the storm wiped out 100,000 of Jamaica's500,000 homes, with another 300,000 damaged: ``We saw wholevillages where not a single building was left standing. It lookedlike Hiroshima after the atom bomb.''   The storm, which dumped up to 10 inches of rain on the island,wiped out the island's banana crop and poultry industry and heavilydamaged the coconut industry and garden crops, Seaga said.   Two days after the hurricane's passing, Jamaica remained withoutelectricity. Most regions still had no water.   Seaga said damage was widespread along the southern coast westof Kingston, although not as devastating as on the eastern end.   The northern coast, where Jamaica's vital tourist industry isbased, escaped the worst of the storm, and only two of the region'sluxury hotels appeared to have suffered noticeable damage.   In Kingston, Jamaica's capital city of 750,000, trees, zincroofs, telephone poles and billboards littered the streets.Military and civilian volunteers worked in virtually every street,pulling down collapsed roofs, sweeping up debris, and bringing foodto the homeless.   At the National Chest Hospital, officials had to contend notonly with storm damage but with looters who stole mattresses andother supplies.   Seaga said he had no doubt ``that this is going to be the worstdisaster that we have experienced in our modern history.''   He said he would hold an emergency Cabinet meeting today tore-evaluate government reconstruction priorities and projectedcosts, as well as Jamaica's requirements in international aid.   ``Now, our first priority is to provide shelter andsustenance,'' the prime minister said. ``It's obvious we'll have tospend much more money than we thought initially we'd have to.''   The United States has sent in Navy cargo planes with plasticroof covering and collapsible water storage tanks. Offers of aidhave come from Canada, Britain, France, West Germany and Israel,Seaga said.   Government officials said Kingston's Norman Manley Airport,severely damaged by Gilbert, would reopen to Air Jamaica flightstoday or Friday.   Part of the tarmac for smaller aircraft was littered withtwisted and bent planes Wednesday. A 10-seater sat against a row ofpalms, its bruised nose to the ground.   The embassy in Washington said airports were open for emergencytraffic only, and communications were extremely limited. It said ithad no reports of American victims.   Power outages forced doctors to conduct surgery by flashlight atmany hospitals, where the winds had caused floods and torn offroofs.   The tiny Cayman Islands began returning to normal Wednesday withno reported deaths, few injuries and much less damage than feared.The islands' 23,000 people ``got on their knees and said `Thankyou,''' said local journalist Carol Winker.</TEXT></DOC>
