But after the megadeals reached in 1988 _ capped by the proposedrecord $24.5 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. _ managers realized``there is no such thing as being too big to be taken over,'' saidMichael Bradley, professor of finance and law at the University ofMichigan.   Take the case of Edward P. Evans, who began the year as chairmanof Macmillan Inc. but left the publishing and information servicesgiant now owned by a British concern after one of the year's mostbruising takeover struggles.   Evans had been given good marks by financial analysts forimproving the profitability of Macmillan since taking over in 1980.   The stock market showed its appreciation by pushing the company'sstock price up more than 12-fold during his tenure. But it wasn'tnearly enough.   The day before Macmillan's annual shareholders meeting last May,a group led by Texan Robert Bass proposed a buyout at $64 a share, a26 percent premium over the company's closing price that day.   Six months later, Evans was gone and the company was no longerindependent despite deploying an arsenal of takeover defenses _ arestructuring, hefty severance agreements for top executives, apoison pill to deter hostile bidders and the assistance of afriendly suitor.   Company management recruited the acknowledged leader in theleveraged buyout business in an effort to acquire the company itselfand was twice declared the winner in the bidding.   But Evans ultimately lost to a persistent rival from Britain whotripped him up in the courts and won the company by simply offeringmore cash.   William F. Reilly, Macmillan's president who was allied withEvans but has stayed on after the acquisition by publisher RobertMaxwell, says the defense strategy was like putting ``just a littlemore glass on the bathroom floor.''   It failed, he said, because ``nothing stops an all-cash offer.''   Martin Sikora, editor of Mergers andamp; Acquisitions magazine inPhiladelphia, said the value of takeover deals in 1988 may shatterthe record of nearly $205 billion set two years ago even though thenumber of deals was down 16 percent through October from a year ago.   He credits the growing presence of buyout funds _ set upspecifically to reap huge returns by buying an undervalued companyand either running it better or selling it in parts _ for drivingthe stakes in the takeover wars higher. ``It has created competitionfor deals,'' he said.   Sikora estimates there is $25 billion to $30 billion invested insuch funds that could be used to borrow up to $300 billion fortakeovers.   Fidelity's Wiggins said the huge amount of money expresslyearmarked for takeovers has enabled dealmakers to start consideringthe larger companies as targets rather than simply the medium-sizedcompanies previously scrutinized.   ``That's a lot better for me because the deepest discounts interms of market price versus private value is often in the bigcapitalized stocks,'' Wiggins said.   Peter Linneman, professor of finance in public policy at theUniversity of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, said recentdealmaking shows how management's focus has shifted from running thecompany well to getting returns for the shareholder.   ``In the old days, management said it was its objective togenerate cash flow, and if the market doesn't see it, so be it ...But what management has realized is, right or wrong, if the marketdoesn't accurately reflect value, someone will come in who will,''he said.   Wiggins said he thinks the trend toward bigger deals shouldcontinue, especially as foreign companies enter the fray moreheavily.   Michigan's Bradley said the trend may depend on how the courtsultimately view the growing efforts by various states to enact lawsgiving corporate managements a veto over hostile takeovers.   Linneman from Wharton said he doubts that Congress will amend thetax laws to limit the deductibility of interest on money borrowedfor takeovers. ``You have corporate America on both sides of eachissue,'' he said.   Charles Minter, a partner in the investment advisory firmComstock Partners, said the debt-financed buyout craze may turn outto be a costly fad, like lending to the oil industry was in the1970s.   ``We see where the banks are lending their money, and stay awayfrom those areas,'' he said. ``There will be some deal that comesalong to break their backs.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
