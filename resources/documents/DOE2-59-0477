Operationparameters of bimetallic and standard fuel cans are compared. The resultsof numerical studies into the water corrosion effect on fuel can integrityas well as experiments on investigation into the WWER-1000 fuel elementbehaviour at burnup above 50 GWxday/t in a research reactor are presented.The results of postreactor studies have shown that irradiation up tomaximum fuel burn up of more than 75 MWxday/kg does not result in suchchanges of the state of fuel cans, fuel pellets and fuel elements asa whole, which could exclude the possibility of further fuel elementoperation up to higher level of burnup. Fuel element length increasedon the average by 1.2 mm (the initial length of the fuel rod made up1 m), the fuel element diameter- by 0.01-0.03 mm. Fuel cans of Zr+1%Nballoy did not undergo oxidation and hydration under irradiation. Thicknessof the oxide film on the external surface of the cans did not exceed3 {mu}m. Hdrogen amount in irradiated fuel cans constituted about 0.005%by mass.</TEXT></DOC>
