Clovis Maksoud, who represents the Arab League in the UnitedStates, said the satellite gave Israel ``a serious strategicleverage'' since the country already had the capability to firelong-range missiles.   Maksoud, in an interview, stressed steps taken jointly by Israeland the United States to strengthen their strategic ties.   He cited Israel's inclusion in the U.S. program to develop aspace-based defense against ballistic missiles and ``Israel'srecord which is replete with disclaiming nuclear capability.''   As a result, Maksoud said, the launching of a test satellite``warrants enhancing Arab defensive capabilities'' so that anyMideast negotiations produce a peaceful outcome ``rather thanratifying Israeli hegemony.''   The satellite is designed for communications purposes, but theArab League official said it could be used to monitor Israel's foes.   ``We are deeply concerned that such a communications satellitecan be modified into a spy system and, therefore, further enhancethe strategic imbalance which the American-Israeli strategicagreement has introduced,'' Maksoud said.   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman, meanwhile, saidthe United States was not involved in any way with the Israeliprogram.   ``We don't have any details of the launch beyond what wasreported by the Israelis,'' he said.   A spokesman for the U.S. Space Command in Colorado, Cmdr. DugaldGillies, said Monday that American radars and sensors picked up theIsraeli satellite shortly after launch. Its orbit has beencalculated to have a high point of 716 miles and a low point of 155miles, he said.   ``It is circling the earth every 98.836 minutes and thesatellite has an inclination (to earth) of 142.86 degrees,''Gillies added. ``It was launched early Monday Eastern Daylight Timeand is in a near polar orbit.''   Defense officials at the Pentagon said they were unsure exactlywhat the satellite's payload included.   ``But we're leaning toward more of an experimentalcommunications package as opposed to a true spy satellite,'' saidone source who asked not to be identified.   ``This launch is impressive because it's a first, but I don'tthink this particular satellite is going to offer much more abilityto keep tabs on their neighbors,'' the source said.   Redman stressed that Israeli leaders had given public assurancesthat their goal was ``peaceful purposes of space research andtechnological advancement.''   Israel is the eighth nation to place a satellite into space. Thecountry is one of the most advanced technologically in the worldand is generally believed to have nuclear capability.   Israeli leaders, preferring to keep potential foes off guard,have responded ambiguously to such assertions but also have givenassurances the country would not initiate a nuclear conflict.   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign MinisterShimon Peres said the launch should not touch off an arms race withArab countries.</TEXT></DOC>
