Fernandez, adefendant in the Iran-Contra case, lost a bid to have criminalcharges dismissed on the grounds that his congressional testimonywas used against him improperly by prosecutors.   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. on Friday denied amotion to dismiss the charges against Fernandez that accuse him ofconspiring to ship arms illegally to the Nicaraguan Contra rebelsand concealing the covert operation.   However, Robinson ordered independent counsel Lawrence E. Walshto submit by Sept. 23 detailed documentation to show his evidenceagainst Fernandez was obtained independently of testimony theformer CIA agent gave to the House-Senate committees thatinvestigated the Iran-Contra affair.   Fernandez, 51, who operated under the pseudonym Tomas Castillowhen he was the CIA station chief in Costa Rica, testified beforethe committees under a grant of ``use immunity.'' That meant thatprosecutors cannot use his congressional testimony against him inthe criminal case and cannot obtain evidence based on leadsprovided by the immunized testimony.   Robinson directed prosecutors to turn over to the court a listof all CIA witnesses who were interviewed after Fernandez gave hiscongressional testimony and the basis for the discussion.   Walsh has denied defense contentions that he relied oncongressional testimony as a source of evidence in the case.   Fernandez is accused of conspiring to ship arms to the Contras,who oppose Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, in defianceof a congressional ban on such aid. Fernandez also is charged withlying to the CIA and the presidential commission headed by formerSen. John Tower, R-Texas, that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.   The judge, meanwhile, also ordered Fernandez to comply with theprovisions of the Classified Information Procedures Act, refusingto declare unconstitutional the statute that requires defendants tonotify the court of any plans to reveal government secrets at trial.   All defendants in the Iran-Contra case _ Fernandez, formerNational Security Council aide Oliver L. North, former nationalsecurity adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakimand retired Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord _ are to be triedseparately, but no date has been set for any of the trials.   North and Secord are named as unindicted co-conspirators in thecase against Fernandez.</TEXT></DOC>
