The grand jury indictments in New York of Mr. Meese's former personal attorney and former financial adviser will likely prove to be the climax of one of the most publicized, politically charged public corruption investigations in recent years.    The announcements, on balance, provide more good than bad news for the embattled attorney general. They appear to close the primary phase of the criminal inquiry delving into Mr. Meese's controversial dealings with the scandal-plagued former defense contractor.    However, court documents filed yesterday disclosed new details about plans by Wedtech officials over the years to try improperly to influence Mr. Meese and other Reagan administration appointees. And the independent prosecutor vowed to continue his investigation of other activities of Mr. Meese that weren't directly related to the now defunct New York City-based contractor.    In a carefully worded, &quot;interim&quot; report, James McKay, the court-appointed prosecutor, said he didn't have evidence &quot;as of this date&quot; to conclude that Mr. Meese &quot;knowingly participated in criminal activity&quot; involving Wedtech or its officials. But Mr. McKay emphasized that he is &quot;actively investigating&quot; other &quot;issues and questions&quot; involving Mr. Meese, &quot;which do not lend themselves to immediate resolution.&quot;    Meanwhile, a federal grand jury in New York returned an 18-count indictment charging, among other things, that San Francisco attorney E. Robert Wallach, Mr. Meese's confidant and former personal legal adviser, used phony documents to &quot;conceal and misrepresent the true nature and purpose&quot; of some $575,000 he received from Wedtech between 1983 and 1985.    According to the indictment Mr. Wallach, and other alleged conspirators, knew that the payments, in part, actually were intended to cover Mr. Wallach's &quot;efforts to influence Mr. Meese and other federal officials&quot; on behalf of Wedtech. In one instance, the grand jury charged, Mr. Wallach, expecting to get a job at the Justice Department, conspired to receive $300,000 from the company in 1984 as an &quot;advance for services he would render in 1985 and 1986 on behalf of Wedtech.&quot;    The indictment doesn't charge Mr. Meese with any wrongdoing, and it doesn't indicate who may have offered Mr. Wallach a job at the department or why it eventually fell through. Although Mr. Wallach accepted the money, according to the indictment, &quot;it was decided&quot; that he &quot;should not take the anticipated position.&quot;    Although the documents only raise these questions without answering them, the felony charges against such close associates are likely to be interpreted as a personal and political blow to Mr. Meese.    The indictment accuses W. Franklyn Chinn, Mr. Meese's former personal financial adviser whom he entrusted with his family's savings in 1985, of conspiring with others to defraud Wedtech and to violate Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements involving a 1986 stock offering by the company.    Mr. Chinn, who served as a Wedtech consultant and later as a director, was accused of helping conceal the purposes of some payments from the company to Mr. Wallach. In addition, the grand jury charged Mr. Chinn -- and still another alleged conspirator -- with sharing more than $1.1 million in fraudulent payments in exchange for promoting and marketing a January 1986 Wedtech stock offering.    Mr. Chinn also was charged with receiving kickbacks and bribes from two senior Wedtech officials in exchange for voting to issue them lucrative stock options.    The other defendant charged in connection with the payments is R. Kent London, a San Francisco doctor and former landlord of Mr. Wallach's.    During a news conference in New York, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, a Reagan administration appointee who reports to Mr. Meese, said: &quot;I have not at any time discussed the case with&quot; the attorney general.    Overall, Mr. Giuliani told reporters, Mr. Wallach received more than $2 million in payments and stock from Wedtech's management between 1983 and 1986 &quot;primarily to influence&quot; federal officials who could help the company, including Mr. Meese.    Cris Arguedas, Mr. Chinn's attorney, said her client intends to fight the charges, which are based exclusively on evidence provided by former Wedtech officials &quot;who have been convicted of cheating, lying and stealing.&quot; Mr. London's attorney couldn't be reached for comment.    Mr. McKay, the independent prosecutor, told reporters he hopes to wind up the investigation &quot;within the reasonably near future,&quot; but he declined to elaborate.    A major part of Mr. McKay's strategy, however, appears to hinge on obtaining testimony from individuals indicted in the New York case, in order to build a potential criminal case against Mr. Meese. Law enforcement officials said that Mr. McKay intends to delve more deeply into an investment partnership Mr. Chinn set up for the attorney general, the legality of which later was questioned by federal ethics officials.    In a court filing released yesterday, Mr. McKay said that none of the three New York defendants have agreed to be interviewed under oath or testify before the Washington, D.C., grand jury. But after their cases have been disposed of, the filing indicates, the independent counsel &quot;once again may seek the testimony of these individuals.&quot;    ---   Andrea Rothman in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
