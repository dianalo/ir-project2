Commercial lots of this compound are analyzed for polymorphiccomposition in order to achieve predictable firing characteristics. Thisanalysis may be done qualitatively with powder diffraction, while quantitativeresults are typically obtained through infrared spectroscopy performedof a nujol mull. The grinding action inherent in the preparation of anujol mull causes changes in two of the polymorphs. These changes arecaused by the pressure generated during the grinding process. Largererrors result when significant amounts of the gamma or delta form arepresent due to the composition-altering effects of sample grinding. Delta-HMXis normally absent from samples that have been solution processed becausethis form is thermodynamically favored only at high temperatures ( andgt;{approx_gt}140{degree}C). In addition, small amounts of delta-HMX that might be present canreadily transform morphology under the mechanical action of normal handling.It is for both these reasons that it is impractical to pursue the quantitativeanalysis of this form, and we will not do so here. The Raman spectraof beta-HMX have previously been measured and shown to have many intensepeaks. The Raman spectra have been used to measure the transformationsbetween polymorphs as a function of pressure and temperature. The resultsreported here show that Raman spectroscopy can be used to detect thealpha and gamma phases in beta-HMX at concentrations well under 1%. 13refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
