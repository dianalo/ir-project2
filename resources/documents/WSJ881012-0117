But investors still wonder if the company can achieve the consistent profit growth that has eluded it for most of the 1980s.    Long viewed by U.S. and European investors as a proxy for the Canadian economy, the venerable railway and industrial holding company is completing a two-year restructuring that has radically changed its face.    No longer is Canadian Pacific in every corner of Canadian industry. Since 1986 the company has shed nine businesses, including its airline, bulk-shipping operations, and controlling stakes in Maple Leaf Mills Ltd., a flour miller; Cominco Ltd., a mining concern; and, most recently, Algoma Steel Corp., a steelmaker.    What remains is a more sharply focussed company concentrated on rail transportation, forest products, energy, real estate and hotels.    &quot;We were too diversified to be competitive in today's environment,&quot; says William Stinson, who took over as chief executive in 1985 and is credited with the company's makeover. &quot;We were spread too thin and we had to reduce the cyclicality of the business over the long term.&quot;    The restructuring has slashed the company's debt and raised its profits, winning praise from the investment community. &quot;If you look at the company's earnings performance they're doing the right thing,&quot; says Andras Petery, an analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Second-quarter profits rose 51% to $230.4 million Canadian (US$190.5 million) or 76 Canadian cents (62.8 U.S. cents) a share from C$152.5 million or 51 cents. Last month Canadian Pacific announced a 27% quarterly dividend increase. Long-term consolidated debt has been cut by C$2.91 billion since the end of 1985 to C$3.98 billion at June 30.    But efforts by the 54-year-old Mr. Stinson to move the company into new territory are being met with investor skepticism and concerns that profits will dip again if commodity prices fall. Critics question the company's C$499.3 million purchase this spring of a 47.2% voting interest in Laidlaw Transporation Ltd., North America's largest school-bus operator and owner of a large waste-management business.    &quot;I was a little puzzled by the price paid for Laidlaw,&quot; says Robert Tang, an analyst for James Capel Inc., New York, who has followed Canadian Pacific for 16 years and supports the restructuring. &quot;I thought it was just too high,&quot; he said, noting that good will accounted for 75% of the purchase price.    &quot;I think their decision to get into Laidlaw was a very poor one,&quot; says Michael Messner, vice president of Pioneering Management Corp., a Boston fund manager that holds Canadian Pacific shares. &quot;It reversed their strategy. There's very little synergy with their transportation business,&quot; he says. &quot;When you deal with school children, it isn't quite the same as unit trains of coal and grain.&quot;    Fueling the doubts is Canadian Pacific's spotty record in acquisitions. The company's last large purchase was in 1981 when it acquired CIP Inc., the Canadian unit of International Paper Co., for C$1.1 billion. The purchase came just before the recession and the high-cost debt taken on hurt the company's profits and reputation for years.    Mr. Stinson responds that forest products are a major factor in Canadian Pacific's recent profit surge and says he didn't pay too much for Laidlaw. &quot;For a control position, the price wasn't high,&quot; he says, adding that the Laidlaw purchase was meant to offset slower growth in the basic transportation business.    &quot;Looking out 10 years, we want to be in businesses that have growth potential. Laidlaw is a fast-growth business and you can expand it on a world-scale basis.&quot; He says Canadian Pacific plans eventually to increase its Laidlaw holdings, which now account for 12.8% of Laidlaw's voting and non-voting shares.    Peter von Ond, an analyst with McNeil Mantha Inc., Montreal, says the jury is still out on the Laidlaw puchase and until the stake is raised, &quot;it isn't going to do anything for Canadian Pacific's standard of living.&quot; He expects Canadian Pacific to earn C$840 million or C$2.75 a share this year, compared with C$636.7 million or C2.12 a share on fewer shares last year. The projection and last year's figures exclude gains or losses from asset sales.    Although Mr. Stinson says the restructuring is largely complete, Canadian Pacific still would like to sell its controlling interest in Soo Line Corp., a railway based in Minneapolis that has been hurt by competitive pressures. The company would like to buy the remaining 50% stake in CNCP Telecommunications from its partner in the venture, government-owned Canadian National Railways. Earlier this year, Canadian Pacific bought Canadian National's hotel chain for C$260 million. Major expansion plans also are under way at Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd. and PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd., the company's oil and gas unit.    Another major change is more aggressive management of Canadian Pacific's huge land holdings, including prime sites in big Canadian cities. &quot;The land should be either developed or converted to cash and the cash be redeployed,&quot; says Mr. Stinson. The company's Marathon Realty Co. unit has announced large real-estate developments on parcels it owns in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal.    Real estate is one of the elements that attracts analysts such as Gary Yablon of Oppenheimer andamp; Co., New York. &quot;We love assets,&quot; he says, noting that &quot;the land is on the books for nothing.&quot;    Michael Lloyd, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc., New York, also likes PanCanadian's extensive oil and gas holdings and says Canadian Pacific's stock is &quot;terribly undervalued.&quot; &quot;I term the company as the Santa Fe and Union Pacific of the north. It has the vast real estate assets that typifies Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. and the natural gas assets that typify Union Pacific Corp. but at a much lower multiple.&quot;    But the company's fortunes are still partially tied to prices for oil and forest products, and profits are expected to be hurt next year by lower rail freight volume resulting from this year's drought-reduced grain crop.    Walter Schroeder, president of Dominion Bond Rating Service Ltd., Toronto, says his company hasn't upgraded Canadian Pacific's single-A debt rating despite the restructuring. He says the company's profits have increased largely because the commodity cycle is near its peak.    &quot;It's going to take time to prove,&quot; says Mr. Schroeder. &quot;The key is how well he {Mr. Stinson} does at the bottom of the cycle, not at the top.&quot;    ---                      Canadian Pacific                   Where the assets are: Transportation ..................................... 36% Manufacturing andamp; Other .............................. 12% Real Estate andamp; Hotels ............................... 18% Forest Products .................................... 16% Energy ....................................... ...... 18%</TEXT></DOC>
