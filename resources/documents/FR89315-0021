When other Governmentproperty is to be provided, identify the items and dollar amounts involved.The dollar amounts provided in Item 10 shall not be included in those specifiedunder Items 6 and 7 unless the property or facilities are part of the procurement.If dollar amounts in Item 10 are included under Items 6 and 7, they shouldbe so annotated under this item on the following pages. (ii) If the proposed contract, exclusive of options, will be for a shorterperiod than the program useful life of any required facilities (as definedin FAR 45.301) and the facilities cannot be used for any purpose otherthan the program effort being contracted for, then the procurement planshall discuss the feasibility of acquiring the right to use the facilitiesfor longer than the proposed contract period as well as the proposed procurementstrategy for accomplishing this use. The following shall be considered: (A) If program uncertainties for continuing beyond the contract periodof performance are sufficient, it may be in the Government's best intereststo acquire use of the facilities during only that time. This strategy maymake the facilities more costly to the Government for the contract periodthan if a contractual arrangement for longer use were made. However, itshould reduce the program risks associated with longer Government facilitiesobligations; and (B) If it is in the Government's best interests to acquire the right touse the facilities for longer than the proposed contract period in orderto take advantage of economies in long-term facilities investment, thenthe proposed contractor's obligations, the Government's obligations thatwill encourage long-term investment, and the contract cost strategy forfacilities shall be addressed. There are many alternative long-term investmentapproaches available for the contracting officer to consider. Some examplesof representative strategies include requiring the contractor to_ (1) Enter into a long-term lease of the facilities from a lessor, subjectto the lease being canceled if the prime contractor does not continue toperform the requirement throughout the useful life of the facilities (e.g.,the contractor is not selected in a subsequent recompetition of the requirement); (2) Purchase the facilities, with depreciation and cost-of-money acceleratedfor the contract period of performance, at the conclusion of which theGovernment has a unilateral option to purchase the facilities at the depreciatedvalue (at or near $-0-) based on the contractor's depreciation schedule.The facilities could then be provided to the successor contractor as Governmentproperty; and (3) Purchase the facilities, with depreciation and cost-of-money overthe useful life of the facilities. At the completion of the contract periodof performance, either the Government would purchase the facilities attheir depreciated value, or the successor contractor would be requiredto purchase the facilities, also at their depreciated value, and continuethe prior contractor's depreciation approach.

(c) If an unsuccessful offeror in a negotiated procurement submits, priorto the award of the contract, a written request for a debriefing, sucha debriefing will be provided at the earliest feasible time. This normallyshall be after announcement of the selection decision and prior to awardof the contract. (``Selection decision'' means the final selection of theone successful contractor, or the contractors where more than one contractis to be awarded). If the selection decision involves more than one contractorpursuant to the major System Acquisition process, the debriefing will belimited in such a manner that it does not prematurely disclose innovativeconcepts, designs, and approaches of the successful contractor(s) thatwould result in a transfusion of ideas which also could inhibit contractorsduring the early phase from offering their best and most promising ideasfor meeting the mission need. However, when the exigency of the situationwill not permit delaying the award in order to debrief unsuccessful offerors,such debriefings may be conducted after award.

Phase B usually covers the explorationof design concepts while Phase C/D deals with developing and fabricatingequipment in accordance with designs that have proven acceptable. In suchprocurements, where Phase B is subject to full and open competition andall offerors are made aware that a continuous process of ``down-selection''will be used, then the subsequent C/D solicitation and award are consideredto be a continuum of the initial competition (Phase B) and the entire processis considered full and open competition. To this end, Phase B should besynopsized in accordance with FAR 5.20I and solicit all known potentialsources to explore design concepts. In addition to the other informationrequired by FAR 5.207, the synopsis should state that the subsequent solicitationfor Phase C/D will build on the design concepts selected in Phase B andthat NASA intends to solicit offers on that procurement only from thosefirms which were successful in Phase B. The Phase B RFP should also includethis statement.(b) Solicitations must be issued for Phase C/D and a source selection accomplished,unless an appropriate Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competitionhas been approved; ``technical'' down-selection from Phase B to Phase C/Dwithout the issuance of a Phase C/D solicitation is not appropriate. Solicitationsfor Phase C/D should be limited to those firms which successfully completedPhase B or to those which can otherwise demonstrate that they meet thedesign requirements of Phase B. Procurements for Phase C/D must be properlysynopsized, and state that it is the second phase of a phased procurementand that the Phase C/D solicitation is being issued to the offerors whosuccessfully completed the Phase B design requirements, and identify thefirms which are being solicited for Phase C/D. The synopsis must also statethat any other potential offeror for Phase C/D must meet the Phase B requirement.If a prospective offeror, other than a successful contractor in Phase B,responds to the synopsis, the contracting officer shall allow the offerorto compete, but caution the interested firm that any product offered mustsatisfy the requirement for an equivalent mature design concept acceptableto NASA delineated in Phase B.(c) Phased procurements which meet the conditions in (a) and (b) aboveare considered to be full and open competition. If only one contractorsuccessfully completed Phase B and, after soliciting offers from more thanone source, no other potential offeror responded to the solicitation forPhase C/D, the award shall be reported as a ``noncompetitive procurementusing competitive procedures'' (see NFS 1804.671-4(m)).(d) When the conditions in (a) and (b) above can not be met or where NASAchooses to develop an independent design after Phase B products have beenevaluated, the procurement should proceed on the basis of full and opencompetition unless circumstances justify using one of the exceptions setforth in FAR 6.302 or one of the exclusions under FAR Subpart 6.2. In anyevent, the synopsis requirements of FAR 5.201 apply. (For this purpose,an ``independent design'' can be: (1) A synthesis of the Phase B products;(2) a totally new design developed by NASA; or (3) a combination thereof.)<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1835_RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTING</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">1835.070</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Amended]</ITAG>13.

The approach used may vary fromwage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances.Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various jobclassifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factorsmay, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from theway different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage BoardPay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinationsissued in the same locality.
