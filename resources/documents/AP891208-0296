Mosbacher said the review of current controls on high-technologyproducts, which should result in proposals for change by April, isa reflection of the sweeping changes occuring in the Communist bloc.   ``Everybody is discussing what we should be doing about EasternEurope, whether it is politically, economically ortechnologically,'' he said.   Mosbacher indicated that Hungary and Poland could be two of themain beneficiaries of such a change. He said those two countrieswere discussing with U.S. officials how to prevent the transfer ofmilitarily strategic items to neighboring Communist bloc countries.   ``Hungary and Poland have talked about giving us additionalassurances about what they are doing with higher technology,''Mosbacher said.   A change in U.S. restrictions, still under discussion in severalgovernment agencies, would be designed to encourage the politicalliberalization in Eastern Europe and to deal with heavy pressurefrom U.S. allies seeking an easing of export controls to the Sovietbloc.   U.S. insistence until now on preserving the controls _ imposedfor nearly 40 years by the 17-nation Coordinating Committee onMultilateral Exports, COCOM _ has been a sticking point inrelations between the Bush administration and its allies.   ``We will re-look at the (COCOM) levels and probably change thelevel of some things approved for trans-shipment to the Easternbloc,'' Mosbacher said earlier in an interview taped for publictelevision's American Interests program.   The United States is considering ``a shortening of the list (ofrestricted items) to those things which are truly important andessential,'' he said. ``The shortening will be substantial ... thatwould be our recommendation,'' said Mosbacher.   Mosbacher said a final administration decision would be made intime to present proposals at the next meeting of COCOM, scheduledfor April in Paris. COCOM consists of the 15 NATO nations, Japanand Australia.   The administration has been split during the debate over theliberalization between hardliners, such as Defense Secretary DickCheney who opposes the easing for national security reasons, andothers, such as Mosbacher who deals not only with U.S. allies butalso American businesses.   Mosbacher said countries such as Poland and Hungary havepromised to allow monitoring to make sure Western technologyexports are not being diverted to other countries.   ``Those countries who have talked to us about on-siteinspections, they're not doing trans-shipment from their country toanother country ... I think we're going to get a lot bettertreatment,'' he said.   ``Hungary has spoken to us about it; (with) Poland we're in theearly stages of discussions about it and there may be others downthe line,'' Mosbacher said.   Mosbacher said the liberalization would not apply to the SovietUnion.   ``We have a lot of steps with the Soviets before we get to thatpoint,'' he said.   The United States also will eliminate the case-by-case approvalrequired until now to export ``dual-use'' high technology items toother COCOM members, said Deputy Secretary of State LawrenceEagleburger.   ``Dual use'' refers to technology that can be used for a statedcivilian purpose or refashioned to produce weapons. The UnitedStates has repeatedly clashed with its allies, especially WestGermany, Italy and Japan, over what it argues are violations ofCOCOM rules regarding dual-use technology.   In the latest such case, the administration has accused theItalian computer manufacturer Olivetti of selling the Soviet Unioncomputerized machine tools that the Soviets used to make jetfighter engines.   Eagleburger said the requirement for individual licenses will belifted within six months. He spoke last week in a Washington speech.   Referring to the question of easing restrictions on exports toEastern Europe, Eagleburger said the ``nature of the militarythreat faced by the West is changing.   ``We and our COCOM partners will want to signal our clearwillingness to respond constructively to the democratization underway in Eastern Europe,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
