The chemicals and energy concern didn't specify when it would end production. But it indicated the phase-out and substitution of environmentally safer products would take several years and require world-wide cooperation.    Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont adopted the new policy after analyzing data compiled by an international scientific panel that linked chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, to the ozone depletion problem.    Du Pont, which estimates that it makes 25% of the world's CFCs, markets the compound under the trademark Freon. The company said its goal is an orderly phase-out of fully halogenated CFC production, coupled with the introduction of alternative chemicals and technologies. Fully halogenated CFCs contain chlorine, which has been found to destroy the ozone layer.    CFCs are used as cooling agents in refrigerators and air conditioners, as cleaning agents, and in making plastic foam. Substitutes for most major applications haven't been adopted. CFCs had been widely used as propellants in aerosol containers, but the U.S. banned that practice in the 1970s after CFCs were found to destroy ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere.    Ozone depletion is a major environmental problem. The ozone layer screens out harmful ultraviolet rays that can cause skin cancer, eye ailments and other health problems, as well as environmental damage.    Analysts said Du Pont's withdrawal from the industry could boost prices of products that use CFCs, but would have little effect on the chemical giant. The company said CFCs accounted for less than 2% of earnings and sales last year. That means its CFC sales totaled about $600 million, contributing as much as $35 million to Du Pont's 1987 profit of $1.79 billion.    Allied-Signal Inc., the second-largest U.S. producer of CFCs, said it is waiting for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to release the complete international study on which Du Pont based its decision. A Du Pont scientist was on the study panel, but the company said it based its analysis on an executive summary of the data released earlier this month. In the meantime, Morristown, N.J.-based Allied-Signal isn't taking any steps to curtail its CFC production, though it is working on development of substitutes.    Though analysts saw little effect from Du Pont's gradual withdrawal from CFC production, the news apparently sparked a sell-off. Du Pont shares fell $3.125, to close at $82.50, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. The issue was the biggest loser among the Dow Jones industrials and one of the 10 biggest decliners overall. Allied-Signal shares also slid, closing at $32, down $1.125, in Big Board trading.    Referring to the ozone-depletion problem, &quot;We take this very seriously,&quot; an Allied-Signal spokesman said, &quot;and we are in agreement with Du Pont that any solution is going to take an international approach.&quot;    Pennwalt Corp., the nation's third-largest producer of CFCs, also called the ozone-depletion issue &quot;a global problem&quot; and called for a world-wide end to CFC production &quot;as soon as practical.&quot; But the Philadelphia-based company didn't indicate it is taking any unilateral steps to curb production.    Joseph P. Glas, director of Du Pont's Freon products division, said the company hopes to drum up support for an international treaty, known as the Montreal protocol, which calls for reductions in CFC use. The treaty was reached last September and signed by 31 nations, but it can't take effect until at least 11 countries, representing two-thirds of the world's CFC production, ratify it. So far, only Mexico and the U.S. have done so.    Mr. Glas said his vision is to stick to the timetable set in the protocol, which would reduce CFC production 20% by 1993 &quot;and then very quickly start stepping it down&quot; to a 95% reduction by 2003. The treaty uses 1986 as a base year and would reduce production by only 50%. The protocol has come under criticism from environmentalists as too lenient.    In a rare show of support, environmental groups generally applauded Du Pont's action. &quot;This is an excellent example of corporate environmental leadership that ought to be emulated world-wide,&quot; said Daniel J. Dudek, senior economist with the Environmental Defense Fund. &quot;This really is a breakthrough. Obviously, Du Pont has been a large part of the problem, but Du Pont surprised everyone, and the policy shake-up is going to be a large part of the solution.&quot;    Geoffrey Webb, international director of Friends of the Earth, said: &quot;I think there could be a domino effect world-wide. The industry has tried to band together to put up a common front, and Du Pont's action could break the log-jam.&quot; Nevertheless, he criticized the company for not establishing a firm timetable.    Du Pont's action reverses its previously reported stand, made earlier this month, when three environmentalist U.S. senators dredged up newspaper ads that Du Pont ran in the mid-1970s. In the ads and separately in testimony on Capitol Hill, Du Pont had promised to stop producing CFCs if they were found to harm the environment. The three senators, citing the treaty declaring the chemicals a menace, called on Du Pont to fulfill its pledge. Du Pont Chairman Richard Heckert wrote to the lawmakers, saying their suggestion to stop CFC production within a year would be &quot;unwarranted and counterproductive&quot; and &quot;more drastic than scientific evidence justifies.&quot;    Du Pont's phase-out plan, some analysts said, will mean that prices of some consumer and industrial products that use CFCs are likely to rise, because substitutes will be more expensive and new designs may be needed for products such as compressors for air conditioners.    John Henry, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., predicted Du Pont's decision ultimately could boost its earnings. &quot;They will be introducing new products . . . and are entitled to a higher profit margin,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
