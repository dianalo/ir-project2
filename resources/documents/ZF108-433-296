The price and the performance of LANs, minis, andUnix-based systems now overlap so broadly that these alternatives are indirect competition for use in many multiuser business applications.andP;  LANs inparticular have matured to the point where they are competing head-on withminis in applications involving not just dozens but hundreds ofworkstations--to the point where hybrid forms combining local area networkswith minis and Unix systems are rapidly appearing.andM;Such assertions have been made before.andP;  They just haven't been backed up.andO;You can find price/performance comparisons, but only between Novell and 3ComLANs, or between DEC MicroVAX and IBM AS/400 minis, or between Altos and ALRUnix-based systems.andP;  While cross-environment anecdotes and rhetoric abound,hard data has been hard to find.andP;  Too bad, because when you're going to batfor the environment of your choice, you want solid figures to prove yourpoint.andM;That's why we decided to produce a Rosetta-stone performance test, one thatwould provide a data bridge connecting LANs, minis, and Unix systems.andP;  Wethought if we could give you direct comparisons between leading examples ofeach genre, you could then extrapolate to other systems not tested here,making better use of the anecdotal information and qualitative evaluationsyou read.andM;Our evaluation process revolves around a suite of accounting-based tests thatchurn drives and I/O and work the processors.andP;  Unlike CPU-intensive benchmarktests, which are more appropriate for testing the suitability of individualworkstations for CAD, DTP, and the like, these tests duplicate the mix ofsystem activities involved in the average multiuser business application.andM;10 NODES OR 100?andM;By using macros rather than humans to act as our data entry clerks, we wereable to load the networks heavily to give you an idea of how they perform inlarge installations.andP;  We timed a data entry expert and found that it took himbetween 30 and 90 seconds to enter each order.andP;  The macro took a consistent 3seconds.andM;With that in mind, we can suggest a conservative rule of thumb forcomparison: look at the one-workstation performance on the Data EntryDegradation test as simulting only two or three human-operated workstations,because of the lack of contention among users to access the server and getdata.andP;  The three-workstation part of the test simulates 20 to 30 live users;again the contention is relatively low considering the number of orders goingthrough the system.andP;  Five, seven, and ten workstations simulate 50, 70, and100 workstation users, respectively.andM;These estimates are conservative in the light of our human/robot order entrycomparison, but one incident during our testing helped validate such highmultiplication factors.andP;  When we were running Platinum Series with aclient/server option under NetWare 386 on a $30,000-plus Compaq Systemproserver, NetWare's system load monitor was consistently reporting 90 percentCPU utilization during the Data Entry test when we ran it on the maximum often workstations.andP;  This isn't even a CPU-intensive test--relatively speaking.andM;Our Sequential and Concurrent Reporting test scores represent the totals ofseparate timings for ten reports, which work the system in different ways.andO;The customer and vendor aging reports are rather CPU-intensive because thesystem is generating columns and doing sorts to fill in those columns.andP;  Thecustomer and vendor statements are just dumping lists off the disks, sothey're fairly pure I/O tests.andP;  The others fall in between.andP;  This explainssome of the discrepancies we noticed among the times needed for differentreports.andM;Our last test, Mixed Processing, runs five reports and five workstations atonce to emulate typical real-life system utilization.andP;  Taken altogether, thisvaried test suite will let you focus on the tests that come closest to theapplications you have in mind for your system.andM;PICKING SYSTEMSandM;Test instruments in hand, we began the search for packages that would fit ourcriteria.andP;  The central problem was to find an I/O-intensive multiuser packagethat ran on LANs, minis, and Unix systems without favoring any one of these.andM;First we consulted with Digital Review, our sister publication specializingin DEC-related news.andP;  Its research led us to consider MCBA accountingsoftware, which has a 17 percent DEC VAX market share and products in the LANand Unix arenas as well.andP;  After weeks of dialogue, MCBA chose not toparticipate.andP;  Fortunately, we had a great alternative: the mature and highlystable RealWorld Accounting System from RealWorld Corp.andM;The RealWorld software turned out to suit our needs well.andP;  It hasconsiderable visibility in both the LAN and Unix environments and, whilerelatively new to the DEC world, has already gained a 5 percent market sharethere.andP;  It's also an MCBA licensee, and it costs less than other namebrandaccounting packages running on DECs: $1,000 per module on small MicroVAXes.andO;This enables you to use it in smaller-scale sites than more &quot;normally&quot; pricedDEC accounting software would permit.andP;  Lastly, while RealWorld isn't fast onany platform, it seems to be equally unhurried on all of them.andM;We knew we wanted to use NetWare 386 as our LAN operating system.andP;  We nextpicked two platforms for it: the hot new Compaq Systempro and a sturdy oldIBM PS/2 Model 80 with a superfast Core 310MB ESDI hard disk.andP;  Both CPUs wererun with 32-bit network adapters--EISA for teh Systempro and MCA for theModel 80.andP;  The Model 80 provided the reality check of a relatively economical20-MHz 386 server; thus, it was certainly more characteristic of what you'relikely to find today than the exotic Systempro.andM;On the Unix side, the choice of operating system was easy: The Santa CruzOperation's SCO Unix.andP;  SCO has done more work than any other Unix vendor onproducing a product suitable for multiuser business applications.andP;  In orderto make direct comparisons, we used the same Compaq Systempro.andP;  On it weinstalled an Arnet Smartport 16-port, 16-bit serial board and adapter card.andO;Arnet Corp. is one of the most popular multiport manufacturers; it also makescomplete PC-based host machines.andM;A 32-bit multiport adapter card would have helped the Unix times.andP;  While thatwasn't available in time for our tests, we were able to activate themultiprocessor extension of unix that lets it use the Systempro's two 386processors; NetWare 386 still lacked the two-386 extensions at testing time.andO;It just goes to show that no matter how hard you try, the playing field isnever level .andP;  .  .  but at least it's there for the game.andM;For the minicomputer we settled on a Digital Equipment Corp. MicroVAX usingVMS, DEC's proprietary operating system, which runs on everything up to themini-mainframe 9000.andP;  MicroVAXes are used in most comparisons between smallerminis, and choosing it enabled us to do our testing at the offices of DigitalReview in Boston, with considerable help from DR Labs staffers.andM;When we approached DEC about the testing, we asked to use its fastest, mostpowerful MicroVAX, the 3900.andP;  DEC, however, chose to supply the mostinexpensive MicroVAX in the line: the 3100, albeit with two 104MB drives and16MB RAM instead of the base model's single drive and 4MB RAM.andP;  This machineis touted as being good for up to ten live users, not necessarily thehundreds of simulated ones who pounded it in our tests.andP;  As it turned out, wewere right in making our original request, but at least the system'sperformance can easily be compared with that of the other VAX machines.andM;Ironically enough, the 3100 cost much less than the LAN and the Unix systemswe tested.andP;  Another irony: our little MicroVAX was smaller and lighter than atypical AT.andP;  Anyone short of Hulk Hogan who tried to pick up a CompqSystempro, on the other hand, might get a hermia.andM;GETTING TO WORKandM;We tested the DEC with 19.2-kilobit-per-second DEC terminals.andP;  For our LANand Unix workstations we used five 286s and five 386s from various vendors--asetup similar to the kind of hodgepodge that most of our readers say theyhave in their offices.andM;Those CPU's considerable aggregate horsepower didn't enter into the Unixtesting, of course.andP;  We just used terminal emulation software to punchkeystrokes out of the serial ports at 9,600 bps.andP;  We wondered whether using9,600 bps instead of higher speeds might affect the results, but if there hadbeen a bottleneck, performance would have degraded in a linear fashion as weadded more workstations, and that did not happen.andM;With everything selected, we marshalled vendors, products, staff, andresources and went to work.andP;  Overall, the test results were deceptivelysimple.andP;  The little Micro VAX 3100 was flattered by our high-powered LAN andUnix systems in nearly every dimension of our performance testing.andP;  The Unixsetup won the Sequential Reporting test but it got bogged down under heavyloads.andP;  The costlier, more complex Systempro LAN won every test that tookplace under any kind of multiuser load.andM;THE MICROVAXandM;Not only was the MicroVAX 3100 with its disks and peripherals DEC's ownchoice for this evaluation, but to make sure things ran as smoothly aspossible, company representatives came in to install and tweak the system.andM;The MicroVAX 3100's slowness was surprising.andP;  DR Labs used a PSS host-basedmacro program, and we first thought that perhaps the overhead it consumedmight have affected the speed, but then considered that macro programsgenerally do not take up a lot of overhead.andM;More important, the pattern established by the slow Data Entry results wasechoed on the CPU-intensive Sequential and Concurrent Reporting tests,neither of which used macros.andP;  Note that the latter test also fairlyrepresents the ten-user load for which the MicroVAX 3100 is targeted, yeteven here it took four and a half times as long as the Model 80-based LAN,and nearly three times as long as the Compaq Systempro/Unix scheme.andP;  Forexample, on the Year-to-Date General Ledger report, which balances CPU andI/O loading, the 3100 took over 3.5 hours, compared with 35 minutes on theIBM PS/2 Model 80 LAN and 108 minutes on the system-pro/Unix setup.andM;These results seemed to indicate that you'd need a VAX with three to fivetimes the overall power of the 3100 (like a VAX 6000 System Model 410 or 420)to match our other systems.andP;  However, a DEC representative said he thought abottleneck might exist with the 30-millisecond, non-intelligently coupled105MB drives (the RealWorld code ran on one drive and the data files on theother).andP;  He suggested the solution might be a MicroVAX 3800 with DEC's smartQ-bus (which the 3100 lacks), a pair of fast 400MB hard disks, and 32MB ofRAM.andP;  Even the 3100 with some fast hard disks--possibly third-partyunits--might do the trick.andP;  Since RealWorld comes as a flock of executablefiles and data files, all with pathnames, they could esily be distributedacross as many as six drives even without the Q-bus.andM;We also speculated that the slowdown in the model we tested could be theresult of the VMS operating system, which originated on much larger-scalehardware platforms.andP;  DEC does offer one other operating system, itsproprietary Unix-type Ultrix, but it wasn't made for business applications(SCO hasn't ported its Unix to the DEC computers).andM;Digital Review reported that the VMS SCSI drivers and SCSI terminator mightbe the problem.andP;  The technicians in the DR Labs did their own tests on a setof third-party drives, drivers, and terminators from an established vendornamed Trimarchi, and these did speed things up considerably on a differentmodel of MicroVAX (which, however, originally came with the same SCSI setupas our test unit).andM;All this doesn't mean that there is no place for the tested system, which ranreliably throughout.andP;  It represents an economical way to run daughterapplications to those on larger VAXes out at remote sites or in workgroups.andO;As long as applications are scaled to its capabilities, it won't produceunconscionable waits for users.andP;  The tested system also beat the LANs inrunning customer and vendor reports sorted by ID (with both sorts on primarykeys).andP;  Most of the other sequential report times weren't too shabby, either;the only exception was for the most CPU-intensive test, the customer agingreport.andP;  There, the 3100's tongue hung out shamelessly as it lagged behindthe rest.andM;In general, MicroVAXes with VMS are among the most popular minis, andnumerous applications are available for this mature environment.andP;  Now it canalso support LANs and terminal operation simultaneously.andP;  That's welcome newsfor anyone with a prior VAX commitment who needs more power out at theworkstations.andP;  You can even stay with a single vendor, since DEC markets itsown versions of Tandy personal computers.andM;HOW ABOUT UNIX?andM;The SCO Unix operating system's aplomb was visible in the ease of getting itup and running; in this respect, it compared quite favorably with NetWare,especially the notorious NetWare 286.andP;  The Arnet multiport board alsoinstalled without a hitch.andM;You can do only so much with one processor--or even, in this case, with two.andO;On the Reporting tests, Unix's percentage of performance degradation underprogressively greater loads exceeded even that of the MicroVAX 3100, thoughit would take far more load than we imposed for the actual processing speedsto cross.andM;The Unix setup did fine on up to five test workstations.andP;  But at sevenworkstations, it started sucking wind.andP;  At the ten-workstation loadrepresented by the Concurrent Reporting test, its aggregate time was a full35 percent longer than the score on the same Systempro under NetWare 386 wihthalf as many processors in use.andM;In general, the Unix system suffered in comparison with the LAN setup whenCPU-intensive reports were run, while it did it best at the same key-indexedsorting reports the 3100 excelled at.andM;Both host processing systems--MicroVAX and Unix--did worst on reportingduring the Mixed Processing test.andP;  This indicates that disk I/O penalizedthese systems more than order processing, which didn't rely on disk I/O asmuch; rather, it tested processing and the transfer rate through the bus.andM;This makes sense, as it shows the underlying limits of host processor-basedcomputing versus the powerful complexity of multiple processors wiredtogether over a network.andP;  For example, the standalone and concurrent reportswere each run by a different workstation on the LAN; the difference in speedbetween the LAN and Unix setup generally correlated with the speed of theprocessor on the workstation running the particular report.andP;  This was trueexcept for the Dell 20-MHz 286, which ran the standalone reports even fasterthan several of the 386s (which varied from 20 to 25 to 33 MHz).andP;  The resultsmay also reflect the fact that we're still running modifiedsegmented-memory-based 8088 code on 386s most of the time.andM;SURPRISE IN THE LAN ARENAandM;Our biggest surprise in the LAN test was that the 20-MHz 386 IBM PS/2 Model80 beat the Compaq Systempro (running on one 25-MHz 386 processor) in nearlyevery one of our tests.andP;  For corroboration, we ran the Mixed Processing andConcurrent Reporting tests on a brace of nearly identical 486 towers fromAdvanced Logic Research (ALR), one with an MCA bus, the other with EISA.andP;  Thewinner was the MCA bus, which was faster in every instance, with the EISA bustaking about 20 percent longer overall.andM;Too many users are still acting as if they're buying a host-based system whenthey buy a network.andP;  They get a fancy new 486 tower and then force it to dragaround all those clunky old ATs they couldn't stand to chuck, when they wouldget better throughput from a more distributed investment.andP;  That said, weshould point out that when we put the MCA version of ALR's PowerCache 486 onthe network as the server, we recorded impressive Mixed Processing times; bycontrast, the PS/2 Model 80 took 12 percent longer and the Systempro 21percent longer.andP;  The ALR 486 EISA machine ran the same test at almost exactlythe same throughput speed as the Systempro EISA machine.andP;  We concluded thatperhaps the MCA bus allows greater throughput--at least under the stiffsystem loads we were imposing.andP;  Or perhaps MCA card technology, being someyears older, has been refined more.andM;If the Model 80 was a faster LAN server than the Systempro, the tables wouldprobably have been turned if we'd compared them under Unix.andP;  In ahost-intensive environment, the Systempro's disk array and faster processor(faster by 13 MHz) would confer far more advantages than on a LAN fileserver.andP;  We did some limited testing on a Unix-based Mitac Series 500 withthree 386s (a machine that lacks Compaq's refined disk array architecture),and the Systempro hammered it.andM;Our results shouldn't lead you to believe that the systempro is a dog on aLAN.andP;  LANs with client/server architectures will be using the server's CPUfar more intensely.andP;  Glance back at our experience with the Btrieve NLMpushing the Systempro up to 90 percent utilization of one processor (see&quot;Adding Up Accounting Performance&quot;).andP;  If we'd added another application tothe server--such as a point or communications server--or more workstations,the CPU would have become the bottleneck instead of the bus and I/O, andperformance would have plummeted.andM;Even in such cases, the bus and drives still count.andP;  We think that's why wesaw only 10 percent performance improvement when using two processors insteadof one on the Systempro under Unix when we ran the Concurrent Data Entrytests.andP;  The extra CPU couldn't speed up the 16-bit multiport adapter on theEISA bus.andM;Such a new box as the Systempro will need much software fine-tuning before wereally know what it's capable of doing.andP;  All we can say now is that softwaremainly built for older designs seems to do about as well on those oldermodels.andM;WHAT IT ALL COSTSandM;When you're living with a budget, you have to consider not just theperformance of these systems but the ultimate cost as well.andP;  A glance at theprices will help you see why Unix is doing so well, and why LANs can be hardto sell unless you can show people really making use of all the horsepower ontheir desktops.andM;Microcomputers.andP;  The ten-user DEC MicroVAX 3100 we tested lists at $31,196,installed on site with all operating system software and hardware, plusperhaps $10 perterminal for RJ11C serial cables.andP;  The price includes aone-year carry-in service warranty; an on-site warranty adds $1,739 for thefirst year and $185 a month thereafter.andM;If you swapped in Trimarchi hard disk systems, Clearpoint Research Corp.andO;memory, and TRW on-site service, you could save quite a bit: $2,700 on thememory and $2,100 on the drives (assuming you could get DEC to sell you a3100 sans drives).andP;  TRW generally charges 80 percent of what DEC does forservice--and supports the third-party products listed here.andP;  So you might beable to get your basic stepup for as little as $26,396.andP;  Using good non-DECterminals could bring the price down even farther, to about $25,000.andM;If you need to increase the capacity beyond ten users, you'd have to pay$5,000 more for the extension to your MVS software license and lat outroughly another $2,800 for a multiport board.andM;As DEC argued, our test load was more like that of a 50-user system than aten-user one.andP;  It's only fair to note the price of its 50-user MicroVAX 3800with two 400MB drives and 32MB RAM: $160,486.andP;  Again, you could effectsavings via third-party drives, memory, terminals, multiport terminalconcentrators, on-site service, and the like.andP;  But if, as we suspect, ittakes a VAX 6000 to match our test LAN's performance, you'd be starting witha $1,200,000-plus base price for the CPU and operating system softwarelicenses alone.andM;A 50-user LAN using DEC 16-MHz 386 PCs with no hard disks and the CompaqSystempro server would cost about $184,000, which is $24,000 more than DEC'scomparable 3800 series Micro-VAX.andP;  On the other hand, a LAN with 50name-brand IBM-compatible 386SXs with 1Mb RAM and 40MB hard disks (such asthe Zeos 386SX-16, a PC Magazine Editor's Choice) and a Compaq Systemprowould cost somewhat less than the DEC Micro VAX 3800.andM;The Micro VAX 3100 tested here seems bested by the other host-based systemson a pure price/performance basis.andP;  It has its place, to be sure, but perhapsnot in open competition with the Unix boxes.andP;  Of course, you could also runPCs on desktops and do what we did in the Unix test-link them to a host viaterminal emulation.andP;  You can even get DEC-and-PC-compatible keyboards foryour PC, along with terminal software from KEA Systems (Vancouver, BritishColumbia) to make the terminal emulation especially painless.andP;  That might bea good way to combine PC processing power with larger-system applications.andM;Unix systems.andP;  Our Unix system running on the Model 80 with the Core harddisk would cost $21,000 complete with the Arnet multiport adaptor, SCO Unix,and ten good Wyse terminals; this price configuration includes everything butthe serial lines.andP;  As with the DEC, you could save with third-party memory,cheaper terminals, and the like.andP;  Overall system cost would increase in alinear fasion, except that you would have to spend $2,100 for anothermultiport adaptor when you exceeded the 16-terminal limit.andM;Running Unix on the Compaq Systempro would add $17,000, for a total of$38,000.andP;  A Systempro-based 50-terminal system would end up costing about$60,000--around a third of the total cost of  50-node LAN or DEC MicroVAX3800 system.andM;LANs.andP;  The price of the LAN is the most difficult one to figure out, since ithas the most variables.andP;  With the Model 80 as the server and ten name-brandIBM compatibles as workstations, figure about $47,000, a price that includesa $7,995 NetWare 386 license and $1,300 for the 32-bit Ethernet adapter.andO;These prices don't include the additional cost of hard disks on theworkstations; they weren't used in our tests, and they aren't required by thenetwork.andP;  You can add $5,000 to the system cost if you want them.andP;  Onceagain, swapping in the Compaq Systempro would add $17,000 to all this, for agrand total of $64,000.andM;Cost for on-site service would almost certainly be higher for the LAN thanfor the Micro VAX system because of all the CPUs involveD, but it might beeasier and cheaper for users to maintain their own equipment thanks to therealtive simplicity of individual PCs and the possibility of troubleshootinga malfunctioning one by simply swapping parts out until the thing worksagain.andM;The bottom line: compared with typical host-based systems--or certainly withUnix--a LAN costs more to buy and install and possibly to maintain as well,but it also does more, is inherently more resistant to performancedegradation from adding users or tasks, and permits cooperative processingmodels that would make full use of the network's distributed horsepower.andO;LANs can also now be combined with host-based systems to create mixed systemsthat might provide the best of both worlds.andM;Overall price scale.andP;  For comparison, in round figures, here's how thenetwork prices stack up for ten-user systems (with NetWare 386 on the LANsand SCO Unix on the Unix systems):andM;* $21,000: IBM PS/2 Model 80-based Unix system.andM;* $24,000: All-Zeos LAN with 25-MHz 386 server with 5M B RAM and a 400MB harddisk, eight 386SXs, one 20-MHz 386 with a 40MB hard disk drive, one 25-MHz386 with an 80MB hard disk drive.andM;* 25,000: DEC MicroVAX 3100 with as many third-party peripherals as possible.andM;* $31,000: MicroVAX 3100 with all-DEC equipment.andM;* $38,000: Compaq Systempro-based Unix system.andM;* $47,000: Model 80--based LAN with workstations comparable to our test LAN.andM;* $64,000: Systempro-based LAN with workstations comparable to our test LAN.andM;* $96,000: Systempro-based LAN with all-Compaq workstations of same speed andprocessor as our test LAN.andM;And for 50-user systems:andM;* $60,000: Systempro-based SCO Unix setup.andM;* $100,000: All-Zeos LAN with 25-MHz 386 server with 8MB RAM and 800MB harddisk drive, plus 50 386SX nodes.andM;* $128,000: MicroVAX 3800 with as many third-party peripherals as possible.andM;* $160,000: Microvax 3800 with all-DEC equipment.andM;* $226,000: Systempro with 50 Compaq Deskpro 286 workstations (monochromedisplay, no hard disk drives).andM;* $282,000: Systempro with 25 Deskpro 286 and 25 Deskpro 386/20 workstations.andM;These price gradients involve differing capabilities, of course, but ourbenchmark tests can help you start to unravel the shifting rations betweenprice and performance across the platforms we tested.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
