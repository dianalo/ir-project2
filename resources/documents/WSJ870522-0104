But the 46-year-old Republican knows what he is looking for: &quot;somebody that is going to be strong and straightforward,&quot; comfortable with who he is, someone who won't sugarcoat things.    Beer-truck driver Brent Burton agrees. The 36-year-old Democrat wants &quot;leadership, honesty . . . a person that is going to let the American average people know what he's about.&quot;    Even though they don't know much about the candidates yet and are in different political camps, these two men and their neighbors share a similar wish list for a 1988 presidential candidate. They want new leadership that is most of all honest with them and that addresses their worries about where the nation is headed.    After all the recent scandals and disillusionments -- not just the Iran-Contra affair but also the Jim and Tammy Bakker sex scandal, Gary Hart's exit from the presidential contest and the Wall Street indictments -- they want officials who are &quot;going to play by the rules and not make up their own set of rules,&quot; concludes pollster Peter Hart.    At The Wall Street Journal's request, Mr. Hart, a Democrat who isn't involved in the 1988 presidential race, last week convened two voter discussion groups -- one of Republicans, the other of Democrats -- in this middle-American community, the home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.    Eighteen months before these voters go to the polls, says Mr. Hart, &quot;what they're looking for are basic values and real people. This is a group of voters ready to move on, ready to change. Part of it is changing a generation, but it's also a sense that there's a job not being done.&quot;    The dozen people in each discussion group, which met separately, aren't enough to represent a scientific sampling of public opinion. But their views echoed and further illuminated the results of a new nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 1,568 adults.    The poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday of this week, shows that Americans are looking for candidates who will articulate new directions and inspire confidence in their ability to lead the country in those directions.    By a margin of 60% to 33%, more Americans in the poll are worried that the country is headed for difficult times than are confident that good times lie ahead; 56% agree with the statement that &quot;most of our leaders in government and business don't really understand or care about people like me,&quot; while 39% disagree with that. And by a margin of 57% to 38%, they want a change of direction in national policies rather than continuing along the path of Ronald Reagan's policies.    Asked which factor is the single most important in deciding who to vote for, 48% of likely voters say that it is having a vision and plan for the country, while 24% choose the candidate's record of competence. Seventeen percent emphasize a strong moral character, while only 9% say that agreement with them on the major issues is uppermost.    The middle Americans in the discussion groups here make clear that Ronald Reagan will shape the landscape of the 1988 race, in terms both of what they are looking for and what they aren't looking for. They seek to recapture the upbeat mood he projects but are also disenchanted with the promise of easy solutions.    &quot;When President Reagan was elected, although I don't really agree with him on everything, everyone seemed to be in a very good mood,&quot; says Denise Derr, 25, a legal secretary and a Democrat. Reagan Republican Denise Moxie, a 35-year-old housewife, acknowledges: &quot;I think possibly this administration that brought us way up may have helped to take us way back down.&quot; Adds Mary Pat Blubaugh, a 58-year-old conservative Republican housewife: &quot;I am trying not to get cynical, but it is difficult.&quot;    At this point, with many of the candidates little known, voters are still trying to fathom what type of people they are. To help elicit their reactions at this early stage, members of each group were shown brief video clips of the current presidential contenders in their party. Their reactions are important not so much for what they say about the specific candidates, but for what they say about the qualities they seek.    What emerges is a desire for a president with a high degree of comfort with himself and a strong sense of conviction, and someone who impresses them with his honesty in attacking the nation's problems. Anyone who is hoping to capture their votes for the White House will do better by being candid than by seeming to have all the answers.    The ability to communicate and establish rapport is clearly one sought-after quality. &quot;I really didn't care what he was talking about, but I enjoyed listening to him,&quot; says Natalie Parr, 32, a Democratic housewife, after watching a brief video clip of Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware. The relative youth and aggressiveness of such candidates as GOP Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and Democratic Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee also attract these voters, but not without stirring some qualms as well: Some Republicans interpret Mr. Kemp's forcefulness as bordering on cockiness, while Mr. Gore's &quot;all-American boy&quot; manner raises some worries about his genuineness.    Donald Singer, 39, who runs a job-training program, complains about Sen. Gore: &quot;For a Democrat from Tennessee, he had no accent. I get the same suspicion about him as I did about Hart changing his signature.&quot;    The voters are clearly looking for candidates who seem personally at ease. Former GOP Sen. Paul Laxalt's easygoing manner and sense of humor was a plus with these GOP voters, although the Nevadan struck Robert Rath, a 53-year-old steel-tubing salesman, as being &quot;too old.&quot; Senate Republican leader Robert Dole's &quot;quick and witty delivery &quot; also wins plaudits from some who say it shows the Kansan's self-confidence.    An image of competence is also a high priority. Several Democrats in the group find that Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis projects a can-do impression. Some Republicans praise Vice President George Bush's experience, but they also worry that he seems to be &quot;a follower&quot; or &quot;a wimp,&quot; and Mrs. Moxie asks: &quot;Is he Reagan's yes-man or does he have a stand on his own issues?&quot; Former Delaware Gov. Pierre du Pont, like his fellow Republican Mr. Bush, stirs some suspicions by appearing &quot;too Ivy League&quot; or &quot;too aristocratic,&quot; but voters like his upbeat, optimistic style.    Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt reminds several of the Democrats of Jimmy Carter, which they didn't like, but Mr. Singer, the job-training director, praises Mr. Babbitt for not having perfect hair and speech: &quot;He seemed to be a little more down to earth.&quot; Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri is praised for his &quot;honesty,&quot; but other Democratic voters say he seems too well-rehearsed and looks too much like all the other candidates.    A perception of strength and confidence is clearly valued -- but too much can be off-putting. Thus, these voters are wary of candidates like the Democratic civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson, the Republican evangelist Pat Robertson -- &quot;too much of a preacher&quot; -- and Republican Alexander Haig, the former secretary of state. Raymond Rubin, 66, a retired accountant, says Mr. Haig &quot;appears strong . . . but I'm afraid it would be too much strength to be president.&quot;    Both groups say there are traits of President Reagan's that they want to see in their next president as well. &quot;I hope he has a sense of humor and ability to handle the press as well as Reagan has,&quot; says Mr. Rath, the Republican salesman of steel tubing. Albert Manzella, 60, a Democrat who is the credit manager of a gas company, likes the fact that Mr. Reagan is &quot;dynamic.&quot;    Even some of the Republicans, however, say they will be looking next time out for someone more engaged in running the government. &quot;I would like to see the next president be more in control over the people underneath him at the White House,&quot; says Dennis Fulmer, 33, an investment-portfolio manager.    Some say they regard the manner in which a candidate addresses issues as more important than the stands he takes. &quot;I like to see how they attack the issues. They may not be what I want to hear, but I like to see how they go about telling me,&quot; says Victoria Cannell, a 29-year-old schoolteacher and a Democrat.    But some issues clearly are important to these voters. Here in the rust belt, issues of jobs and foreign trade seem important with both Democrats and Republicans. In the nationwide Journal/NBC News poll, 28% of those surveyed chose the federal budget deficit as the most important issue; 17% chose unemployment, despite recent declines in joblessness; 17% named AIDS; 13%, drug abuse; 10%, relations with the Soviets; and 8%, foreign trade.    Particularly in the Democratic group, there is a strong yearning for a national rebirth of idealism and government action. &quot;We need someone who is going to reverse a lot of the mind-set . . . acquired through those people who have been running the country: that it's all right to be prejudiced, that it's all right not to care if people are hungry, that it's all right if everyone can't go to school,&quot; says Jean DeGarmo, 56, a part-time clerk-typist.    Republicans seem more intent on strong leadership. They talk about cutting domestic programs to attack the budget deficit and about being tough on the Russians. &quot;Ronald Reagan has started the ball rolling as far as showing some firmness with the Russians,&quot; says Mrs. Moxie, the housewife, &quot;and we need somebody that is going to grasp that hold and pull even tighter.&quot; Mr. Rubin, the retired accountant, says of the next president: &quot;I hope that he wants to cut spending.&quot;    In the nationwide poll, a strong majority of Republican likely voters say they would be more worried by a president who increases domestic programs too much than by one who cuts them back too much; Democrats were almost evenly split. On arms control, Republicans are more worried about having a president too eager for a deal; Democrats are divided on whether it would be worse to have someone too eager or someone who might not do enough.    When asked whether it would be worse to have a president who was too stubborn in clinging to his views or too willing to change his mind, a strong majority of Democrats say that a too-stubborn leader would be worse; a narrower majority of Republicans fear a too-compromising leader more.    Here in the Canton discussion groups, voters say they are frustrated at leaders who have turned out differently from the way they sold themselves to the voters: &quot;The people we've voted in, we felt they had great character, and they all turned out to be bozos,&quot; says Mr. Manzella, the Democrat who is a gas-company credit manager. That feeling adds to these voters' suspicion of candidates who seem overly self-contained, too made-over by professionals -- and too good to be true.    &quot;It's just like they've got a school down there where they send them to all come out the same,&quot; complains Democrat James Frutschy, 37, the audio-visual director at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Christina Gumpp, 31, a jewelry sales clerk, was just as skeptical in the GOP group. &quot;I don't think we get the true picture of how they really feel about things and their issues,&quot; she says. &quot;I think sometimes they're puppets.&quot;    In part because of such concerns, voters in both parties stress that their minds are far from made up. &quot;I really don't think that we have a person that we are looking up to right now,&quot; says Ms. Cannell, the Democratic schoolteacher -- nobody to &quot;sink our hearts into, or our teeth into.&quot;    ---   Which of the following criteria is &quot;most important      to you when deciding who to vote for as president?&quot;*   Vision and plan for the country: 48%    Record of competence: 24%   Strong moral character: 17%   Agrees with you on major issues: 9%    Not sure: 2%   *Asked of 926 likely voters   ---   &quot;When you look ahead to the next few years, do      you tend to feel more confident that the country   is headed for good times or more worried that      the country is headed for difficult times?&quot;   Confident good times: 33%   Worried bad times: 60%   Not sure: 7%   ---   &quot;Which of the following comes closer to your      feelings about the 1988 presidential election?&quot;   In general, the next president should continue along the path of Ronald Reagan's policies: 38%    In general, the next president should change direction in dealing with our nation's policies: 57%    Not sure: 5%</TEXT></DOC>
