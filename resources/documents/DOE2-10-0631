SequentialGB images were obtained after administration of 5 mCi /sup 99m/Tc-Disofeninand the ejection fraction was determined following a 15 min infusionof CCK. Sixteen of 101 (16%) GB failed to visualize up to 4 h; of theremaining patients, 3/85 (4%) showed delayed visualization beyond 1 h,and 82/85 visualized within 1 h. The mean ejection fraction (EF) in 67patients was 56.9%+-27.5% compared to 74.8%+-19.8% in a normal controlgroup of 27 subjects (P andless; 0.005). However, there was a large overlapas 76% of chronic cholecystitis patients had EF values falling withinthe full normal range. GB disease could be identified with confidencewhen the EF was less than 35%, i.e. below the 2 standard deviation rangeof normal. On the basis of radionuclide kinetic studies alone, the majorityof patients with chronic cholecystitis cannot be distinguished from normal.</TEXT></DOC>
