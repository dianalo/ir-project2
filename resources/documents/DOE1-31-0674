<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-31-0674 </DOCNO><TEXT>A formal model for fire initiation is presented. The model accounts forextemely room-specific factors, such as the frequency of maintenancewithin the room. It also accounts for parameters that can be quantifiedmore generically, such as the frequencies of breaker fires and pump fires.It is intended to treat the severe, transient-fueled fires that oftendominate the fire risk. Because of the specificity of the model, an applicationto a generic room is very useful.</TEXT></DOC>
