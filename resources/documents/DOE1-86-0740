It was establishedthat 25-aqueous praseodymium decavanadate Pr/sub 2/V/sub 10/O/sub 28/X 25H/sub 2/O formed as the intermediate solid phase. Then it transformedto the stable solid phase - hexahydrate of acid praseodymium pyrovanadatePrHV/sub 2/O/sub 7/ X 6H/sub 2/O. The prepared vanadates decomposed at{similar_to} 130-160 deg C with formation of praseodymium orthovanadateand vanadium (5) oxide.</TEXT></DOC>
