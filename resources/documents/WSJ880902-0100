Labor's holiday isn't what it used to be.    Only some 16% of the American work force is unionized today, less than half the percentage at the end of World War II. The numbers drop much lower if you leave out government workers, who account for about one-third of what remains of the labor movement. Schoolteachers, one of the largest unionized groups, no doubt take a bittersweet view of the holiday as they again face the trials of another school year.    Industrial unions, by and large, have been weakened by global competition and the rigors of a noninflationary economy. So they have focused more on cooperation and less on confrontation. To show any muscle, they usually have to find a friendly federal judge {see: &quot;REVIEW andamp; OUTLOOK (Editorial): Judicial Ad Hockery&quot; -- WSJ September 2, 1988}, but it is not clear that this serves their long-run interests.    The AFL-CIO once again is backing the Democratic candidate for President. But it has chosen to do so in a very low-key way, hoping not to repeat the mistake of 1984, when its support enabled the Reagan forces to charge Walter Mondale with being in AFL-CIO leader Lane Kirkland's pocket. Mr. Mondale got only some 55% of the union-member vote, exit polls indicated. Even the political backing of organized labor has become a mixed blessing.    Yet the AFL-CIO apparently sees itself with little choice but to be a camp follower of the Democratic Party. The Democrats remain the party of big government. Union leaders, with so many government workers as members, see little choice but to support Democrats.    Labor took some pride in the fact that roughly one-fourth of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta had union affiliations. Of 1,000 labor delegates, 290 represented a single union, the National Education Association. The NEA has become the nation's largest independent union, with significant power. It has been a major obstacle to efforts by conservatives to improve public-school quality through vouchers that would enable parents to send children to schools of their own choice.    But aside from promoting government expansion -- at the expense of all taxpayers, of course -- government unions seem to be losing effectiveness as well. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal-government union, has 180,000 members. But it represents some 700,000 workers, which suggests a lot of freeloading. Even after a $1.5 million loan from the AFL-CIO, it faces a $600,000 cash shortage by the end of the year. At its annual convention in Miami Beach last month it ousted its longtime leader, Kenneth Blaylock, and replaced him with a man it hopes will display more managerial talent, John N. Sturdivant.    Organized labor will celebrate, most certainly. But we wonder how many marchers will be asking themselves whether they are marching forward or into the past. </TEXT></DOC>
