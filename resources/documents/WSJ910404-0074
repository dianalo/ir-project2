That, in part, is why after 30 yearsof trying, the government has been unable to break Pitney'ssolid lock on the postage-meter business.   Pitney Bowes has just emerged from a difficult decade inwhich a trio of foreign competitors nibbled away at its gripon the U.S. meter market. The erosion has now been halted. Inthe process, Pitney has transformed itself from a stodgyvendor of mechanical meters to an aggressive,technology-driven giant with a host of new products in thepipeline and a command of 88% of the U.S. meter market.</LP><TEXT>   That dominance is having predictable results: Estimates ofPitney's future earnings are soaring, right along with thestock price. The company's stock lately has regularly hit new52-week highs, jumping 7% on Tuesday alone.   But Pitney's overwhelming position in the meter market hasalso drawn cries of foul from competitors. The PostalService, too, has been mindful of monopoly. PostmasterGeneral Anthony Frank vows to press meter manufacturers toshare certain technology in the future. The Postal Service,he says, doesn't want &quot;to foster a private-sector monopoly.&quot;   In practical terms, however, that's what Pitney Bowes is.How the company remained so in the face of federal scrutinysuggests the difficulties of unseating an entrenched Goliath.It also shows that whatever qualms the Postal Service has --or had -- about the level of competition in the meterbusiness, its need to ensure the smooth and secure flow ofmail has usually worked to Pitney Bowes' advantage -- and tothe detriment of its rivals.   Pitney's campaign to protect its market position has beenwaged on familiar turf: the drab halls of the Postal Serviceand the Patent Office in Washington. It is here that arcanefederal rules governing mailing equipment are handed down,and where corporate lawyers and engineers scramble to protecttheir companies' technology.   Pitney is an old hand in Washington and has worked withpostal officials throughout its 71-year history. The companyand the agency share the same customer base, plus a mutualinterest in a prosaic but important piece of equipment.   The utility of postage meters to American business, andtheir impact on both the Postal Service and Pitney, canhardly be exaggerated. The 1.2 million meters in corporatemailrooms in the U.S. -- which constitutes 65% of the worldmarket -- have brought big efficiencies to that backroomoperation.   Through those meters and 30,000 to 40,000 more at PostOffice windows, the Postal Service sold $17.4 billion ofpostage in fiscal 1990, amounting to 44% of its totalrevenue. Use of meters saves the Postal Service an estimated$500 million a year in operating costs, largely labor.   As for Pitney, mailing systems, including meters,accounted for 53% of its 1990 revenue of $3.2 billion. Thebusiness equipment group, which includes mailing systems,contributed about 54% of the company's $425.6 million inoperating profit.   The symbiosis between the company and the Washingtonregulators was cemented in the early part of this century,when Chicago inventor Arthur H. Pitney took a prototype meterto the U.S. Post Office for approval. The deft salesmanshipof his British-born partner, Walter H. Bowes, overcame thehesitation of postal authorities. By 1920, both the companyand a new industry were born.   Pitney Bowes has led that industry ever since, though itsdominance has at times been challenged. In 1959 a JusticeDepartment antitrust suit accused the company of illegallymonopolizing the postage meter market. Part of the settlementof that suit obliged Pitney to license its patentsroyalty-free to qualified manufacturers. (The company didn'tadmit any guilt.) But this and most other constraints onPitney were lifted by the late 1960s, and periodic followupinvestigations by the Justice Department have turned up noevidence of improper conduct.   Pitney Bowes insists it competes fairly. &quot;Our customerschoose to come to us,&quot; says its chairman, George B. Harvey.&quot;Should we say, `No, we don't want you to come to us -- gosee someone else?'&quot;   Pitney's rivals have long complained of a Catch-22situation in the U.S. meter market. Out of its need tosafeguard postal revenue, the Postal Service has tightlydefined what a meter is and how it must perform. The neteffect, Pitney's rivals complain, has been to narrow thepossible design approaches for new products. Meanwhile, theyargue, Pitney's ample resources and position in themarketplace have enabled it to amass a sweeping patentportfolio. To design their own products, Pitney's competitorssay they must either risk patent infringement suits or embarkon costly attempts to &quot;engineer&quot; around Pitney patents.   &quot;Pitney has control of the patents,&quot; declares ClausRummer, president of meter maker Postalia Inc., the U.S. unitof Francotyp-Postalia GmbH of Germany.   Nonetheless, Postalia and two other European concerns havebeen able to gain a toehold in the U.S. market. Seizing anopportunity opened by the antitrust consent decree, FridenAlcatel, now a unit of France's Alcatel N.V., usedroyalty-free Pitney patents to help develop its meters in1962. Then Postalia jumped in, followed by IMS/Hasler, now aunit of the Swiss concern, Ascom Holdings Co.   For two decades, the Europeans barely ruffled Pitney. Butby the mid-1980s, Pitney was slipping: Its market share haddropped from almost 99% to 88%.   Shaking off the inertia at Pitney involved a wrenchingabout-face, symbolized in part by the hiring of dozens ofelectrical and software engineers and computer scientists --the new talent that would lead the company's move fromnuts-and-bolts to high-tech. Pitney also took a $110 millioncharge against 1989 earnings to pay for the elimination of1,500 jobs and the rollout of an array of new products.   The blunt instrument of this change has been GeorgeHarvey, the intense, 58-year-old financial man who becamechairman and chief executive in 1983 after working his way upthe ranks. Mr. Harvey got off to a bumpy start as CEO.Initially, &quot;he promoted poor managers to responsiblepositions,&quot; says Fred Allen, his predecessor as CEO, who addsthat Mr. Harvey has since assembled a better team. Otherscharacterize Mr. Harvey as a poor delegator who, as CEO,meddled so much in the mailing-equipment business thatseveral heads of that division departed.   As a numbers man, however, Mr. Harvey was quick to demandthat Pitney get more for its research and development dollar.He hired Guy L. Fougere, formerly with General Electric Co.,as the new engineering and technology chief. Now retired, theBritish-born Mr. Fougere, who is said to have deridedunproductive research as &quot;playing in sandboxes,&quot; broughtPitney engineers out of their ivory tower.   From 1986 through 1990 Pitney raised Randamp;D outlays anaverage of 15% annually, spending $395 million in thatperiod. The company acquired 103 patents last year, comparedwith 69 in 1986. B. Alex Henderson, an analyst withPrudential Securities Inc., says Pitney is &quot;on the cusp ofwhat is probably the most significant new-product cycle inits history.&quot; Prudential again strongly recommended the stockthis week, one possible reason why it has jumped so sharply.In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Pitney closedat $58.25, up $2.125.   One manifestation of this is the company's new technicalcenter in Shelton, Conn. Here, engineers tinker with new&quot;smart&quot; mailing systems that do everything but compose theletter: They print, fold and stuff mail into envelopes, weigheach piece and, of course, print postage. Some automatically&quot;read&quot; addresses against data bases for accuracy; others willhelp a company centralize accounting of mailing costs.   &quot;The company was built on the postage system,&quot; says PaulReese, vice president of technical systems and advancedproducts. &quot;Now it's the mailing business.&quot;   It's no coincidence that the new mail-handling systemsneatly dovetail with the Postal Service's current push forefficiency: Pitney makes it a point to stay plugged in. Ithas a full-time &quot;director of postal relations,&quot; whoseWashington office is a block from postal headquarters.   &quot;He has a very definite agenda -- to get all theinformation possible,&quot; says Thomas F. McGarry, a formerPitney vice president who oversaw Washington operations. &quot;Wewanted no surprises.&quot; Indeed, one Postal Service officialmarvels at sometimes learning about internal post officematters first from the Pitney Bowes representative.   This meticulous field work bore fruit in recent years whenthe Postal Service devised a new method of paying postage onvolume mailings. Known as &quot;manifesting,&quot; the procedurerequires computerized equipment for preparing, tracking anddocumenting large-volume mailings. Learning of thegovernment's plans, Pitney got to work. It introduced a pilotmanifest system before the Postal Service disclosed thespecifications, says a Pitney engineer. The timing, heinsists, was an &quot;absolute fluke.&quot; Other manufacturers havesince introduced manifest systems based on informationprovided by the Postal Service.   Pitney's longstanding relations with the Postal Serviceproved useful at another critical juncture: the marketing ofthe company's &quot;Postage-by-Phone&quot; system. Known technically as&quot;remote meter reset,&quot; this involves meters that are refilledwith postage over the phone lines. Ordinary meters have to belugged to a post office to be refilled.   From the beginning, the Postal Service worried that thenew technology would bolster Pitney's dominance. It agreed tolet the company introduce remote reset only if it offeredpatent licenses to other manufacturers on &quot;fair andreasonable&quot; terms that didn't reduce competition. Theagreement was formalized in 1978 by Mr. Allen, Pitney'schairman at the time, and then-Postmaster General William F.Bolger.   The next year, Pitney introduced Postage-by-Phone on itsmechanical meters. After three years of bickering over fees,it granted Friden a remote-reset license for mechanicalmeters in 1981.   As that deal neared completion, Pitney began to rethinkits three-year-old agreement with the Postal Service. Thewording of the agreement &quot;needs to be clarified,&quot; Mr. Allenwrote to Mr. Bolger. He asked that Pitney be allowed to limitits licensing obligations to the remote system as it existedon Dec. 19, 1980. A more advanced, electronic system had beendeveloped after that date, Mr. Allen explained, arguing thatPitney shouldn't be forced to perpetually license updatedtechnology to its competitors.   The proposal outraged some postal officials. One top aideto Mr. Bolger called it an apparent &quot;attempt to advance thePitney Bowes monopoly.&quot; Nonetheless, a few months later thePostal Service agreed to the company's clarification.   Rivals contend that this decision helped Pitney keep theremote-reset market to itself for nearly a decade. Users werehappy to pay a premium for the convenience ofPostage-by-Phone, and sales soared. One Postal Service surveyfound that roughly 45% of customers with access to theservice took it.   By 1987 Pitney's rivals -- Friden in particular -- wereclamoring to license the newer electronic remote-resettechnology, and the postal service again began pressuringPitney.   Pitney eventually relented, but began demanding licensingfees that Friden and some postal officials saw asintentionally unacceptable to rivals. Friden continued tobargain; IMS/Hasler, meanwhile, had developed its ownremote-reset system.   In practice, the Postal Service had little leverage overPitney and its grip on the remote-reset market. The company'smeters were already widely in use, with some 165,000installed in mailrooms by 1987. Further, postal officials hadcalculated that remote reset was saving the Postal Service$3.3 million annually.   &quot;If we really tried to play hardball with Pitney Bowes,the real loser would be the mailers. We were sort of caughtthere,&quot; says one postal official.   Explains another postal official: &quot;There is no stomachhere to fight Pitney Bowes. Ours is an extensive andwide-ranging cooperative relationship. We don't want tojeopardize it.&quot;   Throughout, Pitney Bowes has maintained that it is willingto license its technology for a fair price, but says itdoesn't want to give it away to global conglomerates that canwell afford to finance their own work. (Friden's parent is ajoint venture of Compagnie Generale d'Electricite of Franceand ITT Corp., while Postalia's parent is partly owned bygiant Siemens AG of Germany.)   Today, both IMS/Hasler and Friden are selling remote-resetmeters in the U.S. Friden, whose attempt to license thePitney patents were unsuccessful, embarked on a costlydevelopment effort that it says delayed its entry until lastyear.   These companies express little hope of making inroadsagainst Pitney anytime soon. Given the sluggish U.S. economyand Pitney's solid market share, they concede they will becontent to keep the business they have. &quot;When the elephantstirs, the mice can get hurt,&quot; says Dan Chasin, Friden'sdirector of corporate development.</TEXT></DOC>
