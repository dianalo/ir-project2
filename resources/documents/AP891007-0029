ROSENFELD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An aging America will pose newchallenges for business, health care and entertainment, just asbaby boomers transformed society as they grew to adulthood, aCensus Bureau official says.   Baby boomers _ the 75 million people born in the 20 years afterWorld War II _ swamped schools and later colleges as they grew up,forcing big investments in classrooms; flooded the job market,adding to pressures that increased the unemployment rate; anddramatically transformed a nation's tastes in music andentertainment, said James Wetzel, chief of the Census Bureau'sCenter for Demographic Studies.   As they grow older, their motivation is changing, he said Fridayduring a symposium on the future at the Associated Press ManagingEditors convention.   ``They're not as concerned about rock stars or collegeadmissions as they were just 10 years ago,'' Wetzel said. ``Thebaby boom generation is into careers. They're moving from sportylittle Japanese cars to minivans. They're concerned with homeownership and child care.''   He said the new buzz word is ``cocooning.''   ``Loosely translated, the baby boom generation is not so fond ofhanging around discos any more. They're staying home with a $2video and a $9 pizza.''   Some of those changes represent the kind of forces that shapenations.   ``The aging of the population has a powerful down side,'' hesaid. ``The young adult population, the population which providesimportant impetus for social change and economic change, isdeclining.''   The number of Americans ages 15-25 peaked at about 43 million in1980 and already has dropped by about 7 million, he said. Between1990 and 2000, he said, about 7 million to 8 million fewer peoplewill be in the 25-35 age group.   Another rapidly growing segment of the population comprisesthose older than 85.   Wetzel said the Health Care Financing Administration projects aneed for 400,000 nursing home beds nationwide between 1990 and2000, or 100 beds a day for the remainder of the century.   He said that barring catastrophes such as war or plague, themedian American will be 36 by the year 2000, compared with under 28in 1970 and 33 today. Median means half are younger and half areolder.   The wave of older Americans will challenge the hierarchy ofindustry, he said.   Among those challenges is a large increase in the number ofpeople looking for promotions to management that far outstrips thepositions available.   Another challenge is recruiting entry level workers from ashrinking pool of available workers.   By the late 1990s, the supply of college graduates may be 10percent smaller than the average pool available in the 1980s,Wetzel said.   He also discussed the massive shift of married women, especiallythose with children, into the job market. More than six of 10 wivesare in the work force, double the proportion of 1950. More thanhalf of the nation's mothers are in the work force and slightlymore than half of all the mothers of children below the age of 1are working, he said.   The population trends also provide evidence of an America inwhich young people remain single longer and where more families areheaded by a single adult.   About 56 percent of the nation's households have marriedcouples, down from 75 percent in the 1960s, he said.   Since 1970, the number of households with married couples andchildren has dropped 3.5 percent.   And in the last 20 years, the number of people living alone hasincreased from 9 million to 21 million and the number of householdsheaded by a single person has more than doubled to 13 million.</TEXT></DOC>
