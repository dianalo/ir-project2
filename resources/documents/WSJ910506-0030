As part of its package, a revival of last year's tax&quot;fairness&quot; theme, the group seeks to raise the top income-taxrate to 35% from 31%, and use the additional revenues toallow taxpayers a more generous $800 credit for each child inplace of the current personal exemption, and to expand theearned-income tax credit for the poor.</LP><TEXT>   The Democratic co-sponsors, who plan to unveil theirproposals at the Capitol today, are Sen. Albert Gore ofTennessee and three influential House members, Reps. ThomasDowney of New York, George Miller of California and DavidObey of Wisconsin. Their initiative comes as the House andSenate majority leaders, Sen. George Mitchell of Maine andRep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, are working on a separatepackage, and in part reflects rank-and-file lawmakers'impatience with the leadership.
