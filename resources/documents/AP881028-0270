What brings up this question is the recent outbreak of reluctanceamong the investing public to endorse and join in the buyout wavesweeping through many areas of corporate America.   The merits and demerits of takeovers and leveraged buyouts, orLBOs, can be debated endlessly. As new deals of unprecedented sizehave surfaced in the past few weeks, however, more and more analystswarned that a long-standing trend was turning into a dangerous mania.   At some point, even some early proponents of LBOs declared, theload of debt created to replace the stock taken out of public handsin these deals threatens to turn into an onerous burden.   The situation seemed to come to a head on Thursday, when ``buyoutfever'' gave way to what looked more like ``buyout phobia'' in thestock market.   Investors, including money managers at some large institutions,began selling instead of buying stocks that were known or rumored tobe candidates for takeovers, buyouts, or restructurings.   The fear did not originate in the stock market. Owners ofcorporate bonds had been selling for several days, restive about theprospect of large new increases in business debt.   Nevertheless, the change of attitude was striking. ``For thefirst time people are seeing how the whole process works,'' saidHugh Johnson at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.   The typical takeover deal, Johnson observed, ``requires afinancing, it requires a SUCCESSFUL financing, and sometimes asuccessful financing is hard to do.''   Should they continue to vote with their pocketbooks againsttakeovers, investors could cause a good deal of trouble for thesecurities business.   Less takeover activity might well mean decreased trading volume,reduced revenues for already depressed investment firms, and lowerstock prices for all concerned, at least in the short run.   But at the same time, some observers argue, anti-takeoversentiment in the market might help defuse a potentially explosiveproblem.   As Anthony Tabell at Delafield, Harvey, Tabell Inc., put it:``The current market, driven as it is by takeovers, raises at leasta few echoes of the banking practices of the 1920s.''   Looking at one proposed deal predicated on about $10 billion ofborrowed money, Tabell said, ``it is hard to see this practice asanything other than the extension of stock market credit, a processwhich, when indulged in excessively in the past, has been known tolead to grief.''   The concept of securities markets acting as a kind of``vigilante'' force to police the economy has been gaining increasedcurrency in recent years.   First it was the bond market. Burned by inflation in the 1970sand early 1980s, bond traders became militant anti-inflationists,pushing interest rates higher each time they saw the slighteststirring of an increase in inflationary pressures.   In some people's eyes, the stock market crash of 1987 was avigilante action, too _ a move to forestall international trade andcredit policies that investors collectively saw as frightening.   In fact, those who subscribe to this view say, the crash probablyprevented a recession, by forcing changes in policies and attitudes,rather than foreshadowing or causing an economic slump.   Economic growth continues, with relatively low inflation. Whetheryou like the idea of financial vigilantes operating in the marketsor not, they appear to be pretty good at getting things their way.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon, Oct. 31</NOTE></DOC>
