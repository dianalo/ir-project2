PIERRE, St. Pierre and Miquelon (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Local fishermenthreatened to confront a large French trawler on the high seasTuesday in a bitter dispute over fishing rights around this Frenchterritory off Canada's Atlantic coast.   Yvon Dodeman, president of the fishermen's union, told reportersa trawler from St. Pierre and Miquelon was called into port toprepare for action against the factory freezer trawler Grand Hermine.   The 6,000 people living on this rocky archipelago 10 miles southof Newfoundland rely almost entirely on fishing for theirlivelihood, with cod the main catch. A compromise last fall allowedone factory ship from France to fish in the zone, but the arrival oftwo touched off tensions once again.   The fishermen charge the factory ships take in too many fish anddon't provide any employment at the territory's fish processingplants.   Michel Auzou, captain of the Grand Hermine, said his ship as wellas the other trawler, the Coma Peche, will not move out of thefishing zone around the islands known as 3PS unless they are forcedto.   ``For a week now we've been insulted and attacked, we never onceanswered back,'' the captain said in an interview with French radio.   ``It's over now. We've been humble for too long,'' he said.``We're not leaving the zone now. The decision has been taken onboth trawlers.''   He pointed out that French fishermen have been operating in thearea for centuries.   Earlier in the day, St. Pierre Mayor Albert Penn said Parisofficials agreed to move the Grand Hermine out of the zone so talkscould begin between French Premier Michel Rocard and a delegationfrom the islands.   There was no immediate comment from the Paris government.   ``The union will take action if the trawler doesn't follow thegovernment's instructions,'' said Dodeman. ``They will prepare theboat to go against the Grand Hermine on the 3PS.''   Dodeman said it will take about six hours for the local trawler,Croix de Lorraine, to reach St. Pierre's harbor.   He would not say what action the fishermen had in mind. In recentweeks some fishermen have threatened to ram the large factoryfreezer trawler or shoot the radar equipment on its bridge.   On Sunday, fishermen blocked planes carrying 60 French policereinforcements from landing.   More than 1,000 people turned out Monday night for a publicmeeting and voted to accept the French government's offer for talksin Paris about fishing rights in the region.   Penn, who is also the territory's senator to France's Senate,said a delegation would go to Paris on condition the Frenchgovernment agrees to tie up one of the two trawlers at St. Pierreharbor.   Penn said the Paris government agreed Tuesday that a French navaltug anchored off St. Pierre will carry a local observer and staywith the trawler Grand Hermine to monitor it.   In St. John's, Newfoundland, the two French military planes thathad tried to bring in police reinforcements to St. Pierre andMiquelon on Sunday flew out Tuesday morning. Their flight plans werefiled to Paris.   St. Pierre residents, some armed with rifles, surrounded oneplane that landed Sunday but allowed it to take off after fourhours. The second plane circled overhead before also flying to St.John's.   Canada and France have a longstanding dispute over fishing quotasand the islands' international boundary. Canada long has complainedof French over-fishing.   Canada and France disagree over the international boundary of theislands and quotas for fish in nearby waters. France claims a200-mile economic zone, but Canada recognizes only a 12-mile limitaround the islands.</TEXT></DOC>
