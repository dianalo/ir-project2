Money managers are paying an average 7.2 cents a share for their stock market trades, according to a recent survey by SEI Corp., a Wayne, Pa., pension consultant. That's nearly level with the 7.3 cents a share a year earlier, SEI says. By contrast, institutional commissions averaged 10.4 cents a share in 1979 and 25 cents a share in 1975.    &quot;I think institutions realize that if they keep squeezing prices down, the service they get from brokers will be squeezed too,&quot; says Gil Beebower, an SEI senior vice president. In particular, he says, lower commissions would hurt brokers' ability to provide stock market research or to handle difficult trades.    Meanwhile, securities firms welcome the break in commission price-cutting. &quot;We aren't at all unhappy,&quot; says Brian Barefoot, director of global broker-dealer operations at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. He says that the profitability of Merrill's institutional equity operations is &quot;up fairly significantly from last year&quot; and that steady commission rates seem to be benefiting other securities firms as well.    Cheaper commissions, of course, have been a major factor in surging stock market volume. In 1986, New York Stock Exchange daily trading averaged 140 million shares, compared with less than 40 million shares a day in 1979 and less than 20 million shares in the early 1970s. With average commissions at slightly more than seven cents a share, institutions and other major investors are able to trade more frequently, at lower cost.    Institutional investors worry, though, that commissions may be only a small part of their overall trading costs. Big buy or sell orders, by their very size, can have a &quot;market impact&quot; that causes them to be executed at unfavorable prices, says Dave Williams, head of Alliance Capital Management Corp. If firms end up paying overly high prices on their purchases, while getting unduly low prices on their sales, any savings on cheap commissions may be negated, he says.    Thus, Alliance is willing to pay higher commissions -- an average of eight cents a share -- to win better execution of its orders. &quot;We've spent a lot of time explaining the difference between commissions and trading costs,&quot; says Mr. Williams, who oversees more than $25 billion of clients' investments.    Several years ago, when commissions appeared headed toward five cents a share or lower, brokers had little luck trying to convince clients to be wary of cut-rate commissions. But &quot;accounts are responding now,&quot; Mr. Barefoot says.    A few big state pension funds continue to push for lower commissions, though, arguing that most of their trades won't have much market impact, regardless of how they are handled. A top investment official at the State of Connecticut Trust Funds says he pays a flat six cents a share on most trades, though he will pay more for &quot;difficult&quot; ones.    Discount brokers, as well, are trying to undercut the big securities firms' commission rates -- but with only limited success. Charles Schwab andamp; Co. offers rates of about four cents a share to institutional clients, while Abel/Noser Corp. says it does trades at two cents to four cents a share.    Institutions seem hesitant about steering many trades to the discounters, however, says SEI's Mr. Beebower. And Hugo Quackenbush, a senior vice president at Schwab, says that while his firm is building up a modest institutional business, &quot;we aren't out to compete with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
