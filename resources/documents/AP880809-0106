Yu Fusheng, vice general manager of China Great Wall IndustryCorp., said Monday the U.S. State Department unofficially had madeit known to Chinese officials that Washington would not oppose theshipment of satellites to China for launch, the newspaper Wen WeiPo reported.   Gen. William Burns, director of the U.S. Arms Control andDisarmament Agency, said at a news conference in this Britishcolony after returning from Beijing that he could not comment onthe report.   The United States and the Coordinating Committee for ExportControl of 16 Western nations have held up requests to use Chineserockets to launch satellites for foreign companies.   Security concerns and accusations of China's alleged unfairprice advantage because of government subsidization have been citedas reasons for refusing to allow the launches.   The newspaper quoted Yu, whose state-run company is in charge oflaunching satellites on Communist China's Long March rockets, asplaying down security concerns. He stressed that the launch servicewas a business endeavor and not an attempt to obtain foreigntechnology.   Foreign companies would be allowed to watch over theirsatellites in China, the newspaper quoted him as saying. Thesatellites would be considered in transit from the time they enterChina through customs until launch, Yu said.   He also denied that China would allow its launch service to beused for satellites with military applications, the newspaperreported from Beijing.   Yu also claimed that China was able to offer low-pricedsatellite launchings partly because labor costs are lower than inother countries offering such services and not because ofgovernment subsidies.   Hughes Aircraft Co., a subsidiary of Hughes CommunicationsInternational, has asked the State Department to approve Chineselaunching of a U.S.-built satellite for an Australian company.   Asia Satellite Communications, a Hong Kong-based consortium,also has asked Washington for permission to send up a U.S.-madesatellite on a Long March rocket next year.   Pressure from Western governments has prevented China'sinternational satellite launching industry from getting of theground. Although Beijing has signed accords with several countries,including Britain and Sweden, on space cooperation, the only firmdeal has been a joint venture reached with Brazil.   That satellite, to be used to study flora, minerals andunderground water supplies, is scheduled for launch in 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
