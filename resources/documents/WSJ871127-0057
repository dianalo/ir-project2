Napco Inc., of Terryville, Conn., admitted that two years ago some &quot;lower-echelon employees&quot; failed to secure the necessary licenses to export to Israel a process developed by the U.S. Army for chrome-plating the linings of 120mm cannon barrels. Napco also issued a statement apologizing for these &quot;unfortunate mistakes.&quot;    Under the U.S. arms export control law, companies must obtain federal licenses to export weapons and munitions or related technology to any country. The fines against Napco follow a two-year investigation by the Justice Department and the U.S. Customs Service.    Federal authorities said the U.S. has no immediate plans to press a complaint against Israel Military Industries, or IMI, a state-owned arms-maker that allegedly obtained the technology from Napco. An Israeli Embassy spokesman said IMI wasn't involved in any violations of U.S. export laws.    According to documents filed in the Albany, N.Y., federal court that heard the case, Napco obtained the chrome-plating process without authorization from the Army's Watervliet Arsenal, with which it had a construction contract. The documents further allege that Napco incorporated this knowledge in products that were shipped to Israel.    Thermo Electron is based in Waltham, Mass. </TEXT></DOC>
