It was the monarch's first address to the nation since lastweek's unrest, which killed nine people.   Speaking on state-run Jordan Television, Hussein did not name anew Cabinet to replace that of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai. Rifairesigned Monday because of the rioting.   The king vowed to ``take all appropriate measures'' and promisedto ``move in quick steps toward holding parliamentary elections.''   Jordan has not had general elections since 1967, when Israelcaptured the West Bank, which supplied half the deputies inJordan's now-suspended 60-member Parliament.   Hussein last year severed links with the West Bank, and a newelection law calls for a 72-member legislature elected wholly fromJordan.   Many observers said the lack of a public voice in government fedfrustrations and contributed to the riots, during which protesterscalled for Rifai's ouster and blamed him for falling livingstandards.   ``Yes, there may have been a mistake here or a mistake there asa result of the endeavors of this official or that regarding thepriorities assigned to internal development,'' he said. ``Butsomeone who looks closely and fairly at these mistakes cannotpossibly see in them anything but minor forces compared with theextent of the straits we are facing.''   Four days of disturbances were triggered April 18 by increasesof 10 percent to 50 percent in the price of gasoline, cigarettes,heating oil and other goods. The increases came on top of asteadily devalued dinar, which has severely reduced livingstandards.   The rioting was the worst domestic violence in Jordan since thearmy crushed Palestinian guerrillas in 1971.   Hussein said his economic austerity program ``was painful.''   ``But to turn to violence, destruction, burning and killing isnot a modern method of expressing discontent, and it is not amethod which we know in our country, where all channels betweencitizen and official are open,'' he said.   He noted that violence was aimed at government property ``suchas health centers, water pumps and transportation services.''   ``Aren't we ashamed and sorry because we damaged ourselves, wethe people of a stable nation, the nation of dialogue anddevelopment?'' he asked.   The king noted that much of the nation's $6 billion debt wasincurred to build up Jordan's armed forces ``on the longestconfrontation strip with Israel.''   He also alluded to the fact that other Arab states failed toprovide much of the $12.5 billion over 10 years promised at a 1978Arab summit.   ``Was it a mistake to support our armed forces? Or is is amistake to trust a brother who promised help, which is the promisewhich encouraged us to borrow?'' Hussein said.</TEXT></DOC>
