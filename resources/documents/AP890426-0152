The guerrillas were taken by U.N. and Red Cross officials fromthe northern garrison town of Oshakati to Ruacana, on the borderwith Angola. Later, they were to be transported to bases of theSouth-West Africa People's Organization inside Angola.   Territorial officials said four other captured guerrillasaccepted an amnesty offered by South Africa and asked to remain inNamibia.   The turnover of prisoners occurred a few hours before the SouthAfrican army and police units were to be confined to their bases soguerrillas still at large could have unhindered passage across theborder into Angola.   Radio stations, aircraft and police vehicles have beenbroadcasting recorded messages from SWAPO commanders tellingguerrillas that by Wednesday evening, only U.N. forces would watchthe border.   More than half of the 1,600 guerrillas who crossed into Namibiaearlier this month have gone back, the state-run South AfricanBroadcasting Corp. said Tuesday. Only a dozen have appeared atU.N.-monitored assembly points because security forces are nearby.   About 290 guerrillas and 27 security force members were killedin fighting after the incursion, according to police. The conflictjeopardized the U.N. independence plan, which calls for electionsin November that SWAPO is favored to win.   South African officials says the 60-hour safe passage periodwill be SWAPO's last chance to get its fighters out of theterritory and into U.N.-monitored bases in Angola.   The fighters may return, unarmed, in a few weeks to participatein the U.N.-supervised election campaign. SWAPO is favored to winthe election.   Albert Nekewaya, one of the guerrillas released Wednesday, saidhe and his comrades had been ordered to enter Namibia and report toU.N. peacekeepers.   ``We didn't know there would be trouble ... but they (thesecurity forces) shot and so we shot back,'' he said. ``Our aim wasnot to fight against anybody but only to give ourselves up to UNTAG(the U.N. force).''   SWAPO guerrillas, mostly operating from bases in Angola, havefought since 1966 to end South Africa's 74-year rule over Namibia,also called South-West Africa.   Under the U.N. plan, SWAPO and South African forces were to beconfined to bases starting April 1, but there was no arrangementfor SWAPO fighters inside Namibia. The incursion prompted SouthAfrica to seek and receive U.N. permission to let its militaryunits leave their own bases to pursue the guerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
