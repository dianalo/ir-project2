The London-based auction house said Yasuda Fire andamp; Marine Insurance Co. paid the highest-ever auction price for a work of art. The second-highest bidder for the famous painting is believed to have been Australian, but Christie's declined to give any details.    The nearly $40 million price, more than triple the previous auction record, shocked the art world, but Yasuda had its reasons. While impressionist art is adored by Japanese art collectors, the Van Gogh sunflower painting had special significance. The artist painted seven sunflower paintings in all, but one is gone forever: It was destroyed in the bombing of Nagasaki during World War II.    A spokesman for Christie's said Yasuda acquired the Van Gogh &quot;to play a prominent part in Yasuda's forthcoming centenary celebration in October 1988.&quot; He added, &quot;It is fitting that the sunflowers will be going to Japan as one version was destroyed during the bombing of Nagasaki, and also because the first sunflower painting was made in 1888, the same year Yasuda was founded.&quot;    In the past decade, Yasuda has been an active arts patron, Christie's said, building the Yasuda Kasai museum within the company's new Tokyo headquarters. That museum is said to house more than 450 works of art, mostly by Japanese and French 19th-century and 20th-century artists, including two Renoir paintings acquired last December in auctions at Christie's.    &quot;The Japanese were always presumably going to be a major bidder (on the Van Gogh),&quot; said Christopher Burge, head of Christie's in New York. &quot;We know they are interested in impressionist pictures and they've got a lot of money. They had a slowdown in the mid-70s, but the Japanese have been strong buyers since the '60s.&quot;    Indeed, Japanese art collectors have been buying Western art since the late 19th century, art experts say, but a veritable Japanese invasion of auction rooms in New York and London began in the early 1980s, fueled by the soaring yen. Last spring, Japanese buyers bought 30% of the impressionist art at Christie's alone. The Japanese have continued to be active buyers this year, and some observers say they are expanding into areas such as old masters and Latin American art, in which they haven't been active before.    Sotheby's, the auction unit of Sotheby's Holdings Inc., said the top lot in the sale of the Duchess of Windsor's jewels last week in Geneva went to Tsuneo Takagi of Heiwado Trading Co.: The diamond merchant bought a 31.26 carat diamond ring for $3.2 million. </TEXT></DOC>
