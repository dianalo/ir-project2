Police reported three people were wounded in the Christianenclave north of Beirut when mortar rounds exploded in residentialneighborhoods.   Officials said the clashes appeared to be limited. But residentswho have seen several cease-fires collapse were anxious.   A newly formed committee made up of officials from the variousfactions met at a horse track on Beirut's dividing Green Line andannounced that shipping blockades imposed by both sides would belifted immediately.   The Arab League envoy, Lakhdar Ibrahimi, told reporters that thegroup agreed ``to work immediately on consolidating a cease-fire''and to reopen Beirut airport, the country's only public airportwhich has been closed since March 12.   But three hours later, the fighting flared. Ibrahimi told theChristian Voice of Lebanon radio: ``These are unnecessary setbacks.I'm getting in touch with the members of the committee to curb thisdeterioration.''   The committee's next meeting was scheduled for Sunday.   The clashes were the first reported since 10 p.m. Friday.Sporadic bursts of automatic weapons fire and occasionalrocket-propelled grenade explosions had been heard throughout theday along the Green Line.   After rejecting numerous other truce attempts by the Arab League,both Christians and Moslems agreed last week to adhere to the latestpeace proposal.   The committee comprises representatives from Christian leaderGen. Michel Aoun's command, the rival Moslem army command of Maj.Gen. Sami Khatib and Syria's two militia allies, the Shiite MoslemAmal and the Druse Moslem Progressive Socialist Party.   But the Syrians were not represented. Although their army hasbeen the main force fighting Aoun's troops, they claim they were notinvolved and that the committee is a matter for the Lebanese only.   All but 150,000 of Beirut's 1.5 million population had fled theshelling for safer areas.   Buoyed by the glimmer of hope that peace may be at hand, tens ofthousands of people jammed the highways Saturday leading into thecity from south Lebanon, where many Moslems stayed.   Khalil Hatab said that he, his wife and six children had lived inone room they rented in the south Lebanonese village of Barja forthe last six months.   ``Can you imagine the eight of us living in one room for half ayear?'' he said as he was caught in a traffic jam at Ouzai onBeirut's southern outskirts.   ``Some of the time we even had relatives, neighbors and friendswho escaped with nowhere to go.''   At the Christian port of Jounieh, cars were bumper-to-bumper onhighways leading into the Christian heartland from the north.   By police count, 929 people have been killed and 2,738 wounded,nearly all of them civilians, since the bombardments began March 8,two days after Aoun imposed a blockade on ports south of Beirutoperated by Druse and Shiite militias.   The Syrians and their allies retaliated by shelling theChristians' 310-square-mile homeland enclave north of Beirut andblockading it.   Aoun initially rejected the Arab League plan because the securitycommittee would not include the Syrians. But he changed his mindFriday after pressure from Christian leaders and Arab governments.   The Arab League plan seeks a political settlement of the civilwar in which more than 150,000 have been killed.   It calls for the 73 surviving members of Lebanon's 99-seatparliament to meet outside Lebanon to formulate political reformsthat would distribute power equally between Christians and Moslems.   The predominantly Maronite Catholic Christians have dominated thegovernment, parliament, the judiciary and army since Lebanon'sindependence from France in 1943.   At that time they were considered the majority. Although therehas been no census since 1932, Moslems now form an estimated 55percent of the 4 million population.   Hardline Maronites, who are mostly pro-European, have resistedsurrendering their traditional privileges, which include thepresidency, for fear of being swamped by the Moslems.   Aoun had gambled that Western powers, including France and theUnited States, would come to his rescue when he launched his ``warof liberation'' to drive out the Syrians.   But that did not happen and it was a major blow when Washingtonclosed the U.S. Embassy in Christian east Beirut Sept. 6 after heaccused Washington of supporting the Syrians.</TEXT></DOC>
