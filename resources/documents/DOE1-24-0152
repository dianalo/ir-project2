I will illustratethe structure and methods in the context of gauge anomalies and willeventually make contact with results obtained from index theory. I willgo into two sorts of generalizations: on the one hand, generalizing thealgebraic set up yields e.g. gravitational and mixed gauge anomalies,supersymmetric gauge anomalies, anomalies in supergravity theories; onthe other hand most constructions applied to the cohomologies which characterizeanomalies easily extend to higher cohomologies. Section II is devotedto a description of the general set up as it applies to gauge anomalies.Section III deals with a number of algebraic set ups which characterizemore general types of anomalies: gravitational and mixed gauge anomalies,supersymmetric gauge anomalies, anomalies in supergravity theories. Italso includes brief remarks on {sigma} models and a reminder on the fullBRST algebra of quantized gauge theories.</TEXT></DOC>
