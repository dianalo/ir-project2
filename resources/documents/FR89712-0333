The trade agreement at issue is the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT). The practices complained of are, <T3>inter alia</T3>, subsidies provided to the EC producers of oilseedsand animal feed proteins that nullify or impair benefits accruing to theUnited States under the GATT as a result of zero-binding tariff concessionsgranted by the EC in 1962, and subsidies provided to EC processors of oilseedsthat encourage purchase of EC oilseeds to the detriment of imports of oilseeds,particularly soybeans from the United States.On January 5, 1988, the Trade Representative initiated an investigationof these practices and requested consultations with the EC, as requiredby section 303(a) of the Trade Act, 19 U.S.C. 2413. Consultations wereheld between representatives of the United States and the EC on January26, 1988, February 19, 1988, and April 19, 1988. These consultations failedto result in a mutually satisfactory resolution of the issues. Thus, onMay 4, 1988, the United States requested the GATT Council of Representativesto establish a dispute settlement panel to consider the matter. The panelwas established and began its work on May 19, 1989. Briefs were submittedto the panel on June 16, 1989, and the panel held its first meeting withthe parties on June 27, 1989. The work schedule established by the panelprovides that further briefing and argument be completed by October, 1989.Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 2414, as amended by section 1301 of the Omnibus Tradeand Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Trade Representative is required todetermine by July 5, 1989, whether the EC's practices deny ``rights towhich the United States is entitled'' under the GATT and whether such practicesare unjustifiable or unreasonable and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.Accordingly, absent any finding by the GATT panel or Contracting Partiesto the GATT, the Trade Representative has determined that there is reasonto believe that United States' rights under a trade agreement are beingdenied by, <T3>inter alia</T3>, the EC's production and processing subsidies on oilseedsand animal feed proteins and the practices resulting therefrom within themeaning of section 301(a)(1)(B), 19 U.S.C. section 2411(a)(1)(B), and thatthe EC practices at issue are unjustifiable and unreasonable, and burdenor restrict U.S. commerce, within the meaning of section 301(a)(1)(B) and301(b)(1), 19 U.S.C. 2411(a)(1)(B) and 19 U.S.C. 2411(b)(1) respectively.Pursuant to section 304(a)(1)(B), the Trade Representative also finds thataction under section 301 would be appropriate in light of the GATT panelfindings.Section 305(a)(1) provides that any action to be taken under section 301shall be implemented within 30 days_in this case, by August 4, 1989. Section305(a)(2) further provides that such implementation may be delayed by notmore than 180 days under certain circumstances. The Trade Representativehas determined that substantial progress is being made with respect tothis dispute as evidenced by the fact that the EC has agreed to the establishmentof a panel to consider issues raised by the United States and is participatingin good faith in the panel's consideration of this matter. Therefore, theTrade Representative has decided to delay by not more than 180 days (nolater than January 31, 1990) implementation of any action to be taken undersection 301. Petitioner has indicated it concurs with this decision.The Trade Representative may reconsider the decision to delay implementationat any point if it appears that substantial progress is no longer beingmade in relation to the dispute, and may reconsider the determination undersection 304(a)(1)(A) in light of the findings of the GATT panel and ContractingParties.<ITAG tagnum="6">A.
