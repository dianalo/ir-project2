The bitter divisions have kept the Pakistani-based guerrillagroups from picking a temporary president, prime minister, andCabinet that they hope will soon replace their homeland's Marxistgovernment and usher in elections.   Today's meetings at a religious compound on the outskirts ofIslamabad were held behind closed doors and there were conflictingreports of their progress. Journalists were kept outside.   Sources associated with the consultative council, or shura, saidparticipants still were divided along fundamentalist and moderatelines.   The Moslem guerrillas have been fighting Afghanistan'sSoviet-backed regime for a decade. The last Soviet troops left thecountry Wednesday under a U.N.-brokered accord.   The guerrillas and some Western diplomats believe the Afghangovernment will soon fall without Soviet troops.   The insurgents are fighting to establish an Islamic republic.However, the fundamentalists want to establish a theocratic regimealong Iranian lines, while the moderates are more nationalist.   The estimated 400 council delegates have failed during gatheringsover the past 10 days to agree on steps toward forming their ownpost-war government or who would lead it.   Iran-based Shiite Moslem guerrillas have boycotted the meeting ina dispute over their proportional representation with the majoritySunni Moslem fighters based in Pakistan.   Delegates on Saturday nominated moderate leader Mohammad NabiMohammadi as president and hardliner Ahmad Shah as prime minister.   However, moderates said they walked out of Sunday's session forconfirming nominees because many hardliners insisted Ahmad Shah beallowed to pick his own 35-member Cabinet.   The divisions have prompted fears of further bloodshed inwar-ravaged Afghanistan. President Najib, who leads the governmentin Kabul, says his forces can successfully battle the guerrillas.   During the weekend, Najib declared a state of emergency, puthimself in charge of a new supreme military command, andconsolidated his power with a Cabinet reshuffle.   Communist forces hold all Afghanistan's key cities, but theguerrillas say they control nearly 90 percent of the countryside.</TEXT></DOC>
