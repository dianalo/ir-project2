But in the two weeks since the Ivan F. Boesky insider-trading scandal came to light, investor worries and a few soured deals have taken some of the gleam off Drexel's renowned takeover-financing machinery.    A survey of the status of several recent Drexel-backed transactions shows some setbacks since the disclosure that Drexel is one of the subjects of investigations by both the Securities and Exchange Commission and a federal grand jury.    Drexel hasn't been charged with anything illegal. And throughout the recent turmoil, Drexel repeatedly has said that its high-yield, low-quality &quot;junk bond&quot; operation, whose growth spurred the takeover boom of recent years, continues to be as strong as ever. It defends every instance of purported difficulty with a transaction as being routine, or because of forces outside Drexel, or blown out of proportion by competitors and other naysayers.    &quot;We've never fallen down on a 'highly confident' letter when asked to perform -- I mean never,&quot; said Leon D. Black, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Drexel, referring to the letter Drexel gives clients assuring them that it can raise funds. &quot;You have to separate the rhetoric from the fact.&quot;    Mr. Black also said that Drexel has done more financing in the past week and a half than any other Wall Street investment bank, including raising $1 billion for Safeway Stores Inc.'s leveraged buyout.    Nevertheless, some on Wall Street are concerned, chiefly because Michael Milken, the head of the firm's powerful junkbond operation, has been subpoenaed in connection with the SEC investigation. While the subpoena doesn't mean that Mr. Milken is guilty of any wrongdoing, it has spurred worries that his legendary ability to tap a network of wealthy bond buyers may become damaged. &quot;It's promoted a whole bunch of fear among us,&quot; said one Wall Street trader. &quot;The trouble is, we're all uninformed about Drexel.&quot; Mr. Milken couldn't be reached for comment.    Besides the Safeway transaction, Mr. Black named several other pacts Drexel has worked on over the past two weeks. They include raising $350 million for Warnaco Inc.; raising $120 million for Revere Copper andamp; Brass Inc.; pricing deals for W.R. Grace andamp; Co. and others; and closing a $500 million equipment-trust-certificate financing for Eastern Airlines, a unit of Texas Air Corp.    The deals that have come under question include offers by Revlon Group Inc. and Wickes Cos.; investments by Carl Icahn, Irwin Jacobs and Samuel Heyman; and transactions by several other large corporate clients.    --Revlon and its chairman, Ronald O. Perelman, last week abruptly withdrew their Drexel-backed, $4.12 billion bid for Gillette Co. Drexel took the unusual step of twice publicly reaffirming its ability to finance Revlon's bid. The first statement came two weeks ago amid a dramatic slide in Gillette's stock price, after the Boesky news broke, to as much as $6 below Revlon's $65-a-share bid. The second came after Mr. Perelman and Revlon sold back their Gillette stake last week, explaining that they weren't able to come to terms with the Boston toiletries company.    --Wickes, a longtime Drexel client, said it was having trouble finding suitable bank financing for its $1.7 billion offer to buy Lear Siegler Inc. Drexel wasn't backing Wickes's bid for Lear Siegler but is backing another billion-dollar Wickes offer, and had said it might possibly raise money for the Lear deal. Lear's stock, like Gillette's, also fell dramatically below Wickes's $93-a-share offering price after the Boesky news. Last week, Mr. Black said Wickes never asked Drexel to finance the Lear purchase. Wickes declined comment.    --Three companies involved in pending deals backed by Drexel have been consistently trading below their deals' prices over the past two weeks, a sign that investors have doubts about the deals. Before the news of the investigations of Drexel, stocks of companies they were financing regularly traded at or above the transactions' prices.    The three are Holiday Corp., Viacom International Inc., and Safeguard Business Systems Inc. Mr. Black said it would be wrong to fault Drexel for the market activity.    --Three well-known corporate raiders, all longtime Drexel financing clients, saw stock prices fall for their most recent major investments amid apparent investor concern about Drexel's ability to provide backing. The three are Mr. Icahn, who has been seeking control of USX Corp., and Mr. Jacobs and GAF Corp.'s Mr. Heyman, who both have large stakes in Borg-Warner Corp.    Referring to Mr. Icahn, who hasn't made clear the next step in his bid for USX, Mr. Black said, &quot;We haven't pulled our 'highly confident' letter, and we still stand behind it.&quot; And regarding Borg-Warner, he said: &quot;We are very good friends with both Mr. Jacobs and GAF, but we haven't been retained by either of them to date on that.&quot; He added, &quot;Any analyst who looks at Borg-Warner ought to be able to see that it's a highly financeable deal.&quot;    Mr. Black said of the recent worries about Drexel, &quot;There have been a lot of rumors, slurs and rhetoric.&quot;    &quot;I think you have to separate out the jitters in an arbitrage community that's been slaughtered in the last few weeks from what the facts of a real transaction are,&quot; he said. He referred to the deep losses that arbitrage traders who speculate in takeover stocks have sustained in the past two weeks. Today, he said, arbitragers &quot;have jitters about everything -- that has to do with emotional responses. That has nothing to do with the facts and the deal flow.&quot;    On the other hand, traders have consistently attributed their stock-market jitters to a new lack of confidence in Drexel's financing power. &quot;You've got a tremendous amount of nervousness about any Drexel deals, particularly unfriendly ones,&quot; one arbitrager said last week. Like most Wall Street professionals discussing the insider-trading probes, he spoke on the condition he wouldn't be identified.    Mr. Black said the Holiday recapitalization, the Viacom management-led buyout and the Safeguard purchase by Mason Best Co. were all proceeding smoothly.    Holiday, a Memphis, Tenn.-based hotel and casino company, recently released more details about its recapitalization, apparently to quell concern about its financing relationship with Drexel. It issued a statement declaring that while it was confident Drexel could raise the entire $2.7 billion needed for the recapitalization, it expects to receive $1.6 billion in financing from banks.    Another major transaction that has figured in speculation about Drexel is the plan by Peoples Jewellers Ltd. and its Swiss partner to take over Zale Corp. Last week, Peoples and its partner said that they had dropped plans to finance the $550 million takeover with Drexel junk bonds, turning instead to bank debt. The companies said that decision preceded the Boesky news. Mr. Black said the decision was unfairly interpreted as another sign of waning confidence in Drexel, and he added that Drexel had recommended to Peoples three months ago that the company use bank debt for the Zale purchase.    And, while Drexel won't be financing the takeover, Peoples and its partner were reported last week to be planning to depend on Drexel after the takeover to raise more than $140 million through junk bonds to refinance current debt at Zale. </TEXT></DOC>
