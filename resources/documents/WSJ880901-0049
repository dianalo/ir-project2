Two Endotronics Inc. insiders, E.I. Schuster and M.J. Parkhill, were incorrectly included because share distributions were mistakenly counted as sales. For the same reason, a 17% decrease in the number of Microcom Inc. shares held by insiders who had traded during the past 24 weeks was misstated. Recent sales by T.A. McConomy, president of Calgon Carbon Corp., amount to 3% of his total holdings of two classes of the company's stock; he has sold 56% of one class of stock. </TEXT></DOC>
