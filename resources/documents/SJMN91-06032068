IS THE PLEA  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Coalition members said the annual competition for building allotmentsshould be simplified, making it easier for small builders to compete in themarket. They also said regulations on &quot;in-fill&quot; development should be eased,and projects approved under the former growth-control ordinance should beallowed to go forward.;    The coalition also said that growth generated fromprojects exempt from Measure P should not be used in calculating population orissuing building permits.;    Many small developers, construction industryworkers and businesses count on construction for their livelihood, they said.;   In giving overwhelming approval to Measure P, voters laid out their broadobjective -- keeping a tight grip on growth. But many aspects of implementingthe measure were left to elected officials.;    While Measure P coversvirtually all residential construction, a recent court settlement could allowowners of certain property on the north side of town to build houses free ofMeasure P restrictions. Coalition members say that would result in the issuingof the same number of building permits given out during eight years of MeasureP competition, depriving many builders of work.;    Council members made oneconcession to builders on Wednesday. In a split vote, the council saiddevelopers may replace an older single-family house with a duplex withoutcompeting for building permits.;    The annual building allotment competitionwas established under a 1977 ordinance and was supposed to ensure measuredgrowth as the city population approached the ordinance-mandated goal of 30,000by the year 2000.;    A broad-based community group called Citizens forOrderly and Responsible Development said the ordinance wasn't working.Declaring the ordinance had become a sieve that was allowing runaway growth,the group gathered signatures to get Measure P on the ballot.;    The measure,approved by a 2-1 ratio, envisions a population of 38,800 by the year 2010. Itputs virtually all building under Measure P guidelines and restricts theamount of land the city can earmark for early development.;    The councilturned over to planning commissioners the task of incorporating a couple ofdozen sticky issues into the new ordinance.;    It also created an advisorytask force to help commissioners as they wrestle with the new ordinance.;   During its hearings, the planning commission will consider a process to handlesmall projects, redefine the core area to promote more orderly growth andencourage development of larger lots. The commission also will take up ways tobring new land into the city -- a tightly controlled issue under Measure P --and whether a portion of each year's building allotments should be reservedfor subsidized housing and units for the elderly.;    The planning commissionwork is advisory. All decisions will be made by the city council.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DALE RODEBAUGH, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910201  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  512  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday February 1, 199100032068,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
