The ruling sets a narrow standard for &quot;fair use&quot; ofcopyrighted software, and is likely to set a precedent in anarea of law that hasn't been extensively litigated,intellectual property, attorneys said.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There are still many questions about how you canlegitimately copy software,&quot; said Ron Laurie, an attorney atIrell andamp; Manella, Century City, Calif. &quot;For example, can youcopy it only for use as intended by the manufacturer? I cansee this decision being applied in that context. What thisdoes is set some limits on copying.&quot;   Current copyright law allows users to copy software whenloading it into a computer; for archival purposes; and forlegitimate &quot;adaptations,&quot; copies that have been modified somuch that they qualify as unique.   While a working definition of &quot;adaptation&quot; hasn't beenhammered out in the courts, last week's decision appears torule out any modification that has been made for thecommercial gain of a user or third party, attorneys said.   The ruling, by Judge Thomas N. O'Neill Jr., came in a casethat started in 1985 as an antitrust complaint filed byAllen-Myland Inc., a Philadelphia firm that modifiesmainframe computers, against International Business MachinesCorp., the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant. In 1988, JudgeO'Neill found in favor of IBM on most of the antitrustcharges; he dismissed the remaining claim last week.   IBM raised the copyright issue in counterclaims when italleged that Allen-Myland had illegally copied its microcode-- software wired into a computer's chips -- to modify modelsof IBM's 3090 mainframe computers owned by Allen-Mylandcustomers. IBM said Allen-Myland should have bought extracopies of the microcode instead of copying it. &quot;We feel thissets a very important precedent in intellectual propertylaw,&quot; said a spokesman for IBM, which has been increasinglyaggressive in the area.   Larry Allen, president of Allen-Myland, said his companyplans to appeal at least part of the verdict, which exposesAllen-Myland to potential losses of as much as $10 million.&quot;The question is: Do I have to pay IBM for copying somethingthat {an Allen-Myland customer} owns, even if I'm copying itso I can modify it for that person's exclusive use?&quot; Mr.Allen said. &quot;I don't think that's fair.&quot;   ---   FAMILY-LEAVE LAW in New Jersey challenged by businesscoalition.   A coalition of business groups, which include the statechamber of commerce and a retail merchants association,launched a constitutional challenge to New Jersey's newfamily-leave law, one of the most liberal in the nation.   The business groups filed suit yesterday against the stateand several officials, alleging that the statute conflictswith the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act(ERISA).   The New Jersey law, which went into effect in May,requires companies with more than 100 employees to provide 12weeks of unpaid leave with benefits every two years toemployees because of the birth or adoption of a child or aserious illness in their immediate family. In later years,businesses with fewer employees would also be affected.   But the plaintiffs maintain that the costliest mandate,health insurance benefits for employees on leave, conflictswith ERISA rules regarding all employee welfare benefitplans.   According to the suit, filed in New Jersey Superior Courtin Trenton, ERISA explicitly &quot;does not mandate that employersprovide any particular benefits.&quot; But because ERISA doesn'texplicitly state that such benefits can't be mandated, thedefendants are likely to argue that it doesn't prevent thestate from requiring them.   The ERISA challenge is particularly strong because ofCongress's explicit desire to craft a single nationalstandard to govern employees and employers, says Steven W.Suflas, a labor lawyer with Archer andamp; Greiner in Haddonfield,N.J. &quot;You have an express statement within the statute thatERISA supersedes state law,&quot; Mr. Suflas said.   A spokesman for the New Jersey division of civil rights, adefendant in the suit, said he hadn't seen a copy of thecomplaint and couldn't comment on it.   Recent efforts to change federal law failed when PresidentBush vetoed family-leave legislation.   ---   ALLIED STORES bondholders threaten suit over sales ofretail chains.   Bondholders of Allied Stores Corp., embroiled inbankruptcy-court proceedings, have informed Allied that theyintend to sue to recover between $700 million and $1 billionthe bondholders committee claims belongs to Allied and itscreditors.   The proposed targets for the so-called fraudulentconveyance actions include Federated Stores Inc. and CampeauCorp., Allied's parent companies; Bank of Montreal; BanqueParibas; Citibank; and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. Thelitigation plans were revealed in a letter from thebondholders committee's lawyer, Jonathan M. Jacobson, tolawyers for Allied.   Allied and Federated filed for bankruptcy court protectionon Jan. 15.   Allied bondholders hope to recover some $500 million fromAllied's sale of Ann Taylor in 1989 and $193 million from itssale of Brooks Brothers in 1988. They claim the money wasimproperly funneled through a network of holding companies tocreditors of Campeau Corp. U.S. Inc., now known as FederatedStores Inc. The bondholders say the money should have goneinto Allied's own coffers.   The bondholders were required to give Allied 30 daysnotice before filing suit. &quot;Our investigation is at the pointwhere we believe it's clear to us that the claims aremeritorious,&quot; said Mr. Jacobson. &quot;It makes no sense to waitfurther before beginning this process because waiting furtherwill in our view delay the reorganization of Allied andFederated.&quot;   In his letter to Allied, Mr. Jacobson said the filing ofthe suit would be postponed if it looked as if the claimswould be resolved without litigation.   David Heiman, counsel to Allied and Federated, said thathe would file a motion with U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge J.Vincent Aug Jr. in Cincinnati asking him to defer thelawsuit. Mr. Heiman said it was &quot;premature to file thelitigation now without giving the debtors a chance to see ifwe can't negotiate resolution of these claims rather thanproceed to formal litigation.&quot;   In documents filed with the bankruptcy court, Alliedmaintained that &quot;a negotiated compromise holds promise forbringing value to the estate expeditiously, economically andfairly&quot; and that &quot;immediate litigation would result only inobduracy, hardened positions and resulting delay.&quot;   Bruce Bennett, lead counsel to Federated Stores Inc. andspecial counsel to Campeau, said: &quot;We disagree with the legalcontentions set forth in the letter. . . . We will continueour efforts to propose and negotiate plans of reorganizationfor the debtors which are acceptable to all affectedconstituencies. If acceptable plans cannot be confirmed, itmay be that a court will have to decide the merits of thiscontroversy.&quot;   Henry Weisburg, an attorney for Citibank, said, &quot;The vastmajority of the allegations in the letter are unrelated toCitibank. Those that relate to Citibank are totally withoutmerit.&quot;   Lawyers for Bank of Montreal said they couldn't comment.Counsel for Banque Paribas and DeBartolo couldn't be reached.   Judge Aug is expected to hold a hearing on the issue Sept.27.   ---   EX-GOVERNORS to track state tax and regulatory matters forlaw-firm clients.
