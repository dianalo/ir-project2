Several OPEC delegates left here yesterday resigned to another drop in oil prices of $1 to $3 a barrel over the next few days. Many oil traders, disillusioned by the apparent inconclusiveness of the meeting, agreed.    OPEC's statement on the outcome of the meetings, which ended Saturday night, was loaded with ambiguity, except to say that the committees will meet again Nov. 17 in Vienna, just prior to the next conference of all 13 member nations.    But despite the vagueness of the public statements arising from the meetings, several positive developments arose. Notably, there were signs that the defusing tensions between Iran and Iraq might facilitate efforts to bring Iraq back into the OPEC production-control system, in which it has refused to participate since 1986.    In addition, the ministers agreed to freeze OPEC production -- now estimated by some at the year's peak of 21.5 million barrels a day -- at its current level. &quot;There will be no {further} increase in production,&quot; said Subroto, OPEC's secretary-general.    In addition, he said, &quot;We discussed several production ceilings with corresponding price structures,&quot; which will be the subject of further consultations among OPEC's members between now and the November meetings. Subroto said the proposals range upward from OPEC's current implied, but widely ignored, production ceiling of 17.4 million barrels a day.    Several oil ministers confirmed they will hold their output at or below current levels until it is determined whether a new, more realistic production ceiling can be adopted. Also, they were unanimous in calling for steps to end the slide in the price obtained by OPEC, now down to about $13 a barrel from the previously targeted level of $18.    Several delegates suggested they favor a 1989 production ceiling equal to or slightly less than the demand for OPEC oil next year, which is estimated to exceed 19 million barrels a day. Some said, however, that the ceiling should be lower in the first half, about 18.5 million barrels a day, and then higher in the second six months, more than 19 million barrels a day, to help reduce the huge buildup in world oil inventories resulting from this year's surge in OPEC output.    According to several delegates, this should provide an OPEC price of $15 to $16 a barrel next year. But some OPEC members, particularly Algeria, seek a production ceiling as low as 17.4 million barrels a day to support a higher price. Whatever price level is to be sought, some delegates suggested, Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf Arab members of OPEC that are producing beyond their current quota should &quot;guarantee&quot; it, in effect, through their own production adjustments.    Much of the talks on a new ceiling focused on how to accommodate Iraq, which has been outside the production-control system since 1986 because of its refusal to accept a quota below that of Iran's 2.4 million barrels a day. Iraq confirmed that it is currently producing 2.7 million barrels a day.    &quot;We will see a new higher ceiling definitely,&quot; Issam Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister, said in an interview. He also said that Iraq still is willing to re-enter the OPEC fold so long as its quota is on par with Iran's and is then increased proportionately with the overall rise in the ceiling. &quot;It is parity with Iran, plus,&quot; Mr. Al-Chalabi said. &quot;But we are still to determine how the 'plus' is to be distributed.&quot;    Iran has previously objected to such an arrangement. But Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, seemed intent on doing his best to reduce tensions with the Arab members of OPEC, including those that supported Iraq in the war. For example, he held long, private talks, described as cordial, with both Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, and with Sheik Ali of Kuwait.    Mr. Aghazadeh also endorsed the view of other ministers here that any new OPEC agreement must be signed and adhered to by all 13 members, including Iraq. &quot;In the next month's conference,&quot; Iran's minister said, &quot;either we will have all members into the agreement -- or nothing.&quot;    Several delegates cited the conciliatory attitudes of Iraq and Iran as the most important development here. &quot;This is the principal result of the Madrid meeting,&quot; said Belkacem Nabi, Algeria's oil minister. </TEXT></DOC>
