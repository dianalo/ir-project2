In formally announcing strike plans at a press conferenceThursday, William Genoese, director of the union's airlinedivision, promised a ``traditional type'' of Teamster walkout.   Separately, the airline announced it lost $265.3 million lastyear, compared with a $462.8 million loss the previous year. Theairline, which earlier estimated it lost $90 million last year,reiterated in the earnings statement its pledge to remain fullyoperational in the event of a strike.   Genoese said there is enough support for Pan Am Local 732 amongother Teamsters locals to cut off the airline's supplies of fuel,laundry and liquor around the world. And he added that there willbe violence ``if the company provokes violence.''   The strike is set to begin at 12:01 a.m. EST Sunday, the end ofa federally mandated 30-day cooling-off period in the labor dispute.   Several travel agents polled Thursday said the public is barelyaware of the conflict, which centers on the Teamsters' demand forhigher pay and the airline's call for belt-tightening.   The 4,500-member Pan Am Teamsters local represents passengerreservation clerks, customer service employees and workers who fuelplanes.   Thomas G. Plaskett, Pan Am's new chairman, told union members ina letter earlier this month that in the event of a strike, theairline ``can and will hire someone to provide the services youwithhold.''   Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said the carrier already hasrecruited potential replacement employees and trained managerswithin the company to perform some of the Teamsters' clericalfunctions.   The Teamsters have yet to receive a show of support from PanAm's four other unions. Jim Gannon, a spokesman for the5,000-member Transport Workers Union, said members votedunanimously Thursday against supporting the Teamsters.   And a spokesman for the airline's flight engineers said memberswere advised to ``continue with their work assignments.'' Thepilots and flight attendants unions also are not expected tosupport the Teamsters.   The pilots, flight attendants and engineers already haveaccepted labor concessions in an effort to ensure Pan Am'sfinancial recovery.   Herbert Teison, of Travel Smart for Business in Dobbs Ferry,N.Y., said most travelers ``don't even know about the strike.''   And Jack Bloch, president of JB's World Travel in New York, saidhe hasn't seen any cancellations yet. ``Their frequent-flierprogram, their special fares that are lower than most othercarriers and their triple mileage offer keeps people choosing moneyover service,'' he said.   Pan Am had no comment on a Teamsters claim that the carrier hasbegun installing armed guards throughout its facilities at NewYork's John F. Kennedy International Airport, the airline's mainhub.   ``Obviously security is a top priority,'' Hanlon said. ``We aremaking preparations to deal with it, but we won't disclose whatthey may be.''   Genoese said the hiring of the guards was a provocation that byitself could spark violence among members.   The Teamsters, Pan Am and Meredith Buel, a spokesman for theNational Mediation Board in Washington, D.C., acknowledge thatnegotiations are still going on. But Genoese said no progress hasbeen made and he remains pessimistic.   Picketing is expected to begin Sunday morning, and severalrallies have been scheduled at hotels near JFK airport.   ``Our people are all positioned, they have signs and they knowwhere to go,'' said Frank Bertucelli, business representative forLocal 732.   Pan Am, which operates Pan American World Airways Inc., aNortheast air shuttle and other services, needs labor concessionstotaling around $540 million over three years to ensure itssurvival, analysts and company sources estimate.   The Teamsters say they have offered $75 million in concessionsover the next three years. Pan Am has sought an 8 percent wage cutper year, work rule changes and revisions to its health care plan.   The Teamsters claim that the give-backs amount to a 15 percentto 17 percent wage cut for members, who make an average $480 a weekand have not received a raise since 1981.   Last month Plaskett last month rejected an offer from theNational Mediation Board to arbitrate the contract dispute with theTeamsters.   By rejecting arbitration, Plaskett set in motion a federallymandated 30- day ``cooling-off'' period between the two sides. Atthe end of that time, Pan Am would be free to impose its demands onthe union, which in turn would be free to strike.</TEXT></DOC>
