The commercializationresults presented in this study reflect a total industry initiative.In fact, the technology was used in fields other than the intended automotivefield. The government policy after the termination of the Rankine programwas to insure proper documentation of the results. No attempt was madeto encourage technology transfer and commercialization of the basic technology.This study shows the societal and economical impacts that are possiblewhen research technology is converted into products for the marketplace,and also the degree of difficulty associated with technology conversion.</TEXT></DOC>
