Alick Rankin, Scottish andamp; Newcastle's chief executive, said Elders &quot;has now decided to act in a way which is likely to inhibit&quot; his company's business. He called on Elders to &quot;explain clearly why it has chosen to act in such a self-interested way.&quot;    In June, Scottish andamp; Newcastle objected to Elders lifting its holding to 8.92%, saying any larger stake &quot;would be to the disadvantage of the company's commercial and trading interests.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
