For zinc substitutionfor cadmium in cadmium-tetraphenylporphin k/sub H//k/sub D/=1. Kineticisotope effect of formation reactions of metalloporphins is due to NH-NDsubstitution in porphyrin molecules. Its small value is explained byminor deformation distortion of NH porphyrin bonds and by nonlinear configurationof N...H...Solv fragments in transition states.</TEXT></DOC>
