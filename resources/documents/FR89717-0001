L. 99-603, Congress provided for the expansionof the legally available workforce by giving resident status to foreignfield workers in perishable crops. These ``Special Agricultural Workers''(SAWs) are not required to remain in agricultural work upon acquiring lawfulstatus. To replenish the supply of labor for perishable crops, should SAWsabandon this work, section 210A of the Act provides resident status toadditional foreign workers if a shortage of seasonal agricultural workersis determined by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Labor.Unlike SAWs, these ``replenishment agricultural workers'' (RAWs) are obligatedto perform seasonal agricultural services in each of the first three yearsafter having been accorded temporary residence. RAWs who fulfill this conditionmay be given the status of permanent resident. A RAW who fails to performthe requisite seasonal agricultural services is deportable. RAWs who desireto become citizens of the United States are obligated to perform seasonalagricultural services in each of two additional years. Section 210A(c) of the Act directs the Attorney General to provide forthe admission or adjustment of aliens to lawful temporary resident statusto meet the projected shortage, if any, of workers to perform seasonalagricultural services, as determined by the Departments of Agricultureand Labor. <ITAG tagnum="84">History of This Regulation </ITAG>On August 15, 1988, a notice of availability for public comment of a preliminaryworking draft of regulations to implement section 210A(c) was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 53 FR 30685. The many comments received fromfarmworker and grower representatives, members of Congress and others helpedthe Service to refine its views and many of the suggestions were adoptedin drafting the proposed rule. On March 3, 1989, the proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 54 FR 9054. The comment period expired onApril 3, 1989. Thirty three comments were received, representing the viewsof a much larger number of employer and farmworker advocacy organizations,state and federal government agencies, members of Congress, and individuals.The Service believes that the widest range of opinions has been expressedand greatly appreciates these comments. Each has been considered and manycommentors will see the effects of their comments on this rule. Due tothe number of changes that have occurred since publication of the proposedrule, the Service has opted to issue this regulation as an interim rule,with request for comments. This will enable the Service to take actionto implement the RAW program while affording concerned persons an opportunityto comment on changes which have been incorporated into this rule sincethe proposed rule was published.To aid the reader in fully appreciating how the RAW program will work,we will discuss the program generally, and then by specific areas whichelicited the major comments regarding the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Determination of Need for Additional Workers</ITAG>The number of aliens admitted or adjusted each fiscal year under the provisionsof section 210A(c), which is referred to as the ``shortage number'', isdetermined jointly by the Secretaries of Labor and Agriculture with theBureau of the Census from data collected during the prior fiscal year.If the determination is made that there will be no shortage of workersin any year, no RAW shall be admitted or adjusted in that year unless theEmergency Procedure for Increase in Shortage Number at section 210A(a)(7)is implemented.<ITAG tagnum="84">Basic Characteristics of the Program </ITAG>It is important to understand the nature of this program and to differentiatethe RAW program from the recently concluded legalization programs alsoauthorized by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. With regardto the sections 210 (SAW) and 245A (Legalization) programs, Congress delineatedprecise standards, entitlement and benefits for applicants. Also specificallyprovided by the SAW Program statute, were procedures for administeringthe programs, including an administrative appeals process and strict confidentialityof applicant's records. These provisions were not included in section 210A.Section 210A of the Act merely states that the Service must adjust or admitthe number of replenishment agricultural workers determined by the Secretariesof Agriculture and Labor. It does not stipulate when the Service must beginto admit or adjust replenishment workers, who is eligible, how the selectionand petition process is to be conducted, how the programs are to be administeredor what protections must be accorded applicants. The Service has developed in these regulations a program to admit or adjustaliens most likely to perform the required work in seasonal agriculturalservices. This rule is balanced by concerns for fairness and equity andis responsive to commentor's suggestions. <ITAG tagnum="84">Definition of ``Agricultural Employment'' </ITAG>The definition of ``Agricultural Employment'' has been changed from thatcontained in the proposed rule. The definition in the proposed rule wasan attempt by the Service to simplify the Department of Labor definitionof ``Agricultural Labor and Services'', as used in the H-2A program. Forpurposes of consistency, and to minimize confusion, that language has beendeleted and in its place the Service has referenced the Department of Labordefinition in its entirety, as set forth at 29 CFR 655.100(c)(1). However,to help registrants, the simplified definition is presented in the informationwhich accompanies registration cards, for illustrative purposes only. <ITAG tagnum="84">Single Registration for the Duration of the RAW Program </ITAG>The proposed rule described a procedure to be employed for the admissionor adjustment of RAWs only during fiscal year 1990, if required. Severalcommentors stated that the Service should promulgate a consistent standardfor the duration of the RAW program to avoid confusion. The Service hasadopted this recommendation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Outreach and Advertising of the Program </ITAG>Several commentors expressed concerns that the RAW program would be ignoredor that eligible aliens might not become aware of the benefits of participationif the Service did not mount a large scale public relations campaign. Othercommentors stated that the Service should again make use of community outreachorganizations, or Qualified Designated Entities (QDEs), as it had duringthe SAW and Legalization programs. The Service has modified the rule toinclude participation of qualified designated entities (QDEs). QDEs ingood standing may amend their agreements with the Service and will be ableto provide assistance and disseminate information to the public concerningthe RAW program. The rule also permits these QDEs to certify copies oforiginal documents submitted to the Service as part of the petitioningprocess. QDEs would also serve as the sole point for distribution of registrationcards to aliens who reside outside of the United States. <ITAG tagnum="84">Bilingual Forms </ITAG>Some commentors expressed concern that the response to a call for registrationby eligible aliens might be lowered if registration forms were not publishedin languages other than English. The Service is persuaded by these commentsand will produce the instructions accompanying the registration card andpetition form for status as a RAW in a combination English and Spanishformat. All forms will remain in English, although instructions will bein English and Spanish. <ITAG tagnum="84">Eligibility Criteria and Priority Consideration </ITAG><T3>Minimum age_</T3>Most commentors supported the proposal that RAWs beat least 18 years of age by October 1, 1989. Some suggested, however, thatthis restriction discriminates against many otherwise qualified, able andwilling young workers and could preclude the unification of farmworkingfamilies here. The Service acknowledges the validity of these argumentsand the humanitarian concern behind them but believes that there are morecompelling reasons to maintain this minimum age standard. Some states havelaws restricting the exposure of minors to certain substances used in theperformance of seasonal agricultural services and prohibiting minors fromoperating certain farm machinery. There are many jobs that would satisfythe RAW work requirement which would not expose minors to these risks,however, such employment may not always be available. The Service is concernedthat to avoid deportation for failure to perform the 90 days of requiredwork, some minors may feel compelled to leave school and/or to take thesejobs which could be injurious to their health. The Service will not change the requirement that aliens must be eighteenyears of age or older to be invited to petition for RAW status. However,aliens who are not yet, but, who will become eighteen years old duringthe period beginning October 1, 1989, and ending October 1, 1992, may registerbut will not be invited to petition for temporary resident status untilthey have reached their eighteenth birthday. <T3>Qualifying work standard_</T3>Most commentors supported the eligibilityrequirement of a minimum of 20 man-days of prior agricultural employmentin the United States between May 1, 1985, and November 30, 1988. Therewas some dissent on the requirement that qualifying work must have beenin the United States with reference to a colloquy between Senators Grammand Simpson. This colloquy emphasized that RAW status would be availableto any alien without preference or discrimination with respect to nationalorigin. The Service recognizes that this requirement would yield a largernumber of eligible aliens from certain nations due to recent patterns ofimmigration. We note, however, that applications under the SAW program,which required at least 90 days of prior employment in seasonal agriculturalservices in the United States, were received from nationals of almost everycountry in the world. The Service believes that this requirement will yielda population of eligible aliens more likely to fulfill the work requirementbecause of their familiarity with agricultural standards and practicesin this country and that it is not inconsistent with the policy agreedto in the colloquy. It will be retained.<T3>Disqualification for illegal entry after November 6, 1986</T3>_Mostcommentors, for a variety of reasons, urged the Service not to disqualifyaliens who entered the United States illegally subsequent to the enactmentof IRCA on November 6, 1986. A majority of them recommended November 30,1988 as the disqualification date, to coincide with the end of the periodin which qualifying work for RAW status could be performed and the beginningof full enforcement of employer sanctions in perishable agriculture. Thelatter date, it was argued, would make available many more otherwise qualifiedfarmworkers. The disqualification date for illegal entry to the UnitedStates has been changed to November 30, 1988. <T3>Ineligibility of aliens in H-2A status</T3>_Several commentors representingagricultural employers urged that the RAW program should not disrupt theH-2A program. Congress attempted to make the pre-IRCA H-2 program moreusable to agricultural employers by enacting the H-2A program in IRCA.The Service believes it would be contrary to the intent of Congress ifthe RAW program were to conflict with the operation of the H-2A program.This rule provides a solution similar to that adopted in the SAW program.Aliens in H-2A status on the date of filing their petition for RAW statuswill, if their petition is    approved, be given temporary resident statuseffective the date the H-2A status expires. So that the requisite numberof aliens will be admitted or adjusted during the fiscal year as requiredby statute, aliens whose H-2A status continues into the next fiscal yearwill be granted temporary resident status as of the last week day of thecurrent fiscal year. Similarly, temporary employment will not be authorizedfor these petitioners until their H-2A status expires. <T3>Priority consideration</T3>_Many commentors recommended that one classof aliens or another within the eligible population be given priority inselection. The classes described were generally the classes identifiedin the proposed rule, although the recommended order of priority variedconsiderably. There was near unanimous approval, however, of preferencefor otherwise qualified aliens who are the immediate relatives of IRCAlegalized aliens. In this connection, one commentor pointed out that, unlessthe Service imposed a reasonable cutoff date on when a marriage creatinga family relationship to an IRCA legalized alien may have occurred, therecould be a ``wave of holy matrimony'' to gain preference in selection.This rule gives preference for selection, within each priority class, tospouses and unmarried sons and daughters of IRCA legalized aliens. Therule further provides that to be qualifying any marriage or adoption creatingthe claimed family relationship must have occurred on or before November30, 1988. <T3>Priority issues</T3>_The differences between the variable registrationstandards of the proposed rule have shaped the discussion of priority considerationin the comments received. There are two issues: (1) Whether or not priorityshould be given to eligible aliens whose qualifying employment was in seasonalagricultural    services; and (2) whether or not priority should be givento eligible aliens who are residing in the United States. With respect to the nature of qualifying employment, although there weresome comments favoring a priority for experience in seasonal agriculturalservices, most commentors, including organizations representing employersof seasonal agricultural workers, recommended against this priority. Sincethe purpose of the RAW program is to provide a seasonal agricultural workforce,the views of employers of this workforce are especially important withrespect to qualifying experience for RAW status. This rule does not providefor priority in selection based on the type of prior agricultural workexperience. There were numerous comments on the issue of whether registration shouldbe limited to aliens in the United States. Comments by farmworker advocatesthat it would be better to legalize the status of workers already herebefore importing additional workers from overseas, are particularly persuasive.The Service also believes that this policy would support the policy ofpromoting family unity by legalizing the status of qualified family membersalready here. Moreover, such a limitation would simplify administrationand public understanding of the program. The only alternative to a requirementof U.S. residence under the statute is to allow registration and subsequentpetition from aliens anywhere in the world. From the experience of theService and the Department of State in the SAW program, many fraudulentSAW applications were proffered by aliens abroad. The service believesthat any eligible alien should have an opportunity to register. It is,however, also mindful of an overriding requirement of the statute thata number of aliens equal to the shortage number be admitted or adjustedduring the    fiscal year. The Service is, therefore, concerned that thetime required for the Department of State to contact and interview possiblylarge numbers of ineligible aliens abroad would jeopardize the administrationof the RAW program. Therefore, to expand the registrant pool to includethose aliens outside the United States who are most likely to be eligible,overseas registration will be allowed but only through QDEs. This restrictionwould avoid a possibly confusing and time consuming worldwide program.Priority in selection will be given to aliens in the United States. <ITAG tagnum="84">Timing of Registration </ITAG>The proposed rule provided for a registration to be held only if a shortagenumber is announced or a formal earlier estimate is received from the Departmentsof Agriculture and Labor as to the probable size of a shortage number,including a reasonable margin for a possible emergency increase. The Servicewas concerned about raising the expectations of aliens which be frustratedif there were no shortage number and was reluctant to commit resourcesto gear up for a registration process in the absence of a shortage number.Commentors from the Congress and the agricultural industry felt stronglythat a registration be conducted as early as June 1, 1989 to allow theService to begin admitting or adjusting RAWs shortly after October 1, 1989.On June 16, 1989, the Departments of Agriculture and Labor provided a jointletter to the Service which advised of the need for 50,000 potential RAWsto be available to be adjusted or admitted and urged that this number shouldbe    available for possible fall 1989 shortages. The letter stated thatreports of shortages in California, the anticipated growth in the seasonalagricultural industry, reports of seasonal agricultural workers leavingagricultural employment and the absence of indications that the availabilityof domestic farmworkers would increase, all indicated that RAWs would beneeded. The Service will, therefore, conduct a registration during theperiod beginning September l, 1989 and ending October 3l, 1989. Upon announcementof a shortage number, the Service will randomly select up to 20 percentof the shortage number from the existing pool of registrants. These registrantswill be invited to petition under an expedited procedure which providestemporary employment authorization prior to adjudication of the petition.If no shortage number is announced by the Secretaries, registrants willnot be invited to petition. However, the Service will retain registrationcards for potential future selection and invitation to petition. The Service appreciates the cooperation of the Departments of Agricultureand Labor in providing information indicating the need for a registrationprior to the announcement of a shortage number.<ITAG tagnum="84">Registration of Denied SAW Applicants</ITAG>Many persons commented on the proposed first use of aliens whose SAW applicationhad been denied by the Service as a source of RAWs. The comments were splitbetween those who approved of this policy and those who believed that personswho filed SAW applications only to obtain work authorization, should notbe favored over aliens who, in good faith and often on the advice of counsel,did not file because they knew that they were not qualified. Some commentorswho approved of using denied SAWs advocated the inclusion in this categoryof aliens who had filed skeletal applications pursuant to court order.The Service finds merit in the question of equity raised by commentorswho opposed priority consideration for denied SAWs and believes that afurther question of equity would occur because not all SAW applicationswill have been adjudicated by the registration period. This rule, therefore,provides no special consideration for denied SAW applicants. Denied SAWsmeeting the RAW eligibility standard may, of course, register.<ITAG tagnum="84">Registration Fee</ITAG>Many commentors were critical of the restrictive requirements for acceptingregistration cards and the policy of the proposed rule that the Servicewould not respond to status inquiries. The Service has made concessionsin response to some of these comments and will have a toll-free inquiryservice. Because of this and improvements in the initial processing ofall registration cards and the random selection methodology to supportthe information system, start-up costs have surpassed initial estimates.Because of this, the Service has found it necessary to place a ten dollar($10.00) fee on registration. However, to balance this, and to not increasethe overall cost to a selected alien, the Service has reduced the petitionfee from the proposed $185.00 to one hundred and seventy-five dollars ($175.00).The registration fee of ten dollars ($10.00) must be paid at the time theregistration card (Form I-807) is returned to the Service. The Serviceis providing a pre-addressed envelope to make this easier.<ITAG tagnum="84">Receipt and Sorting of Registration Forms</ITAG>The proposed rule contained provisions for receipt and handling of registrationcards and the consequences of the Service receiving unusable cards. Manycommentors urged the Service to accept registration cards no matter howfiled, issue a receipt to every alien submitting a registration card, andreturn unusable cards to aliens with an explanation of any deficienciesand opportunity for correction and resubmission. The Service appreciatesthese comments and recognizes the concerns of aliens who have registeredor are awaiting word on selection or further information on their petitions.Having evaluated each of the comments received, the Service believes thatwere it to accede to commentors requests for handling of registration cards,the random selection process would become invalidated. Moreover, as theregistration period for the RAW program will be sixty (60) days long, theService would have to commit a great deal of resources to just processingthe mail that would be generated by these concessions.The Service's policy with regard to the filing, receipt and initial processingof registration cards (Form I-807) will not change with regard to the mannerof filing which will be accepted. Registration cards will not be acceptedby any means other than by regular mail, nor at any other location or addressthan the one specified in instructions accompanying these forms. Formssubmitted by any means requiring any form of written acknowledgement willnot be processed. Registration forms may not be submitted in person. Onlyone registration card per person will be permitted. Persons who submitmultiple registration cards will not be considered for selection.However, following the processing of the required fee for registration,a fee receipt will be mailed to the address provided by the alien on theregistration card. In addition to the fee receipt, this document will provideinformation helpful to the alien including how to notify the Service ofa change of address and how to use the new toll-free telephone inquirysystem. With regard to commentor requests that illegible or incomplete registrationcards be returned to aliens for correction and resubmission, Service policywill not change. Service and contractor personnel will make every effortat using registration cards as submitted. Commentors, in general, failedto realize that a registration period must be necessarily brief and thatthe integrity of the random selection process to be used to select aliensto be invited to petition requires a definitive end to the time allowedfor submission and receipt of registration cards. The Service believesthat if aliens and their representatives read the bilingual instructionsand complete the relatively simple registration card carefully, there willbe little question of whether a card can be interpreted by the Service,or need for returning incomplete or illegible cards to aliens. The responsibilityto submit a properly completed, legible registration card on time withthe correct fee is the responsibility of each alien or his or her representative.The Service will not delay registration or compromise the integrity ofthe random selection process to follow up on such errors. Registration cards received on time at the Service's central processinglocation will be sorted according to priority class listed in andSection;210a.2(b). Within each class, these cards will be again sorted accordingto family preference for aliens claiming immediate family relationshipto an alien legalized under IRCA. Those registrants in the first prioritytier and within the pool claiming family relationship to an IRCA legalizedalien will be used first in the random selection process. <ITAG tagnum="84">Inquiry System </ITAG>The proposed rule indicated that the Service would not respond to inquirieson either the registration or petition processes. Many commentors stronglybelieved that the Service should respond to these inquiries. To addressthis concern, the Service will provide a toll free telephonic inquiry capabilityfor the RAW program. Aliens who have mailed registration cards accordingto the instructions provided with the card will be able to call this tollfree system, from anywhere in the country, from any touch tone telephone.Using this system, a caller will receive information as to whether a registrationcard was received, whether the alien was selected to be invited to petition,if the alien was selected to petition, and if a petition package has beensent to the alien. After the completed petition package is returned tothe Service, callers can verify whether an interview has been scheduled.In addition, the Service plans to expand this service to include the voicereporting of changes in address, in conjunction with the present policyof requiring the submission of a change of address Form (I-697A) and notifyingthe post office of a forwarding address. The Service is attempting in the registration process to be as helpfuland as fair to registrants as possible. To go further, such as to providean appellate procedure and other enhancements, would work against the basicpurpose of the program, which is to select a given number of people ina specified period of time to meet potential labor shortages. It is importantto keep in mind that, the RAW program does not carry with it the same entitlementas the Legalization and SAW programs. The purpose of the statute is fulfilledwhen the specific number of eligible aliens are admitted or adjusted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Random Selection of Persons Invited to Petition </ITAG>Although commentors did not mention the random selection process, we wouldlike the public to know how it will work. The selection process shall proceedin two stages: (1) The Service will establish registers of potentiallyeligible aliens who will be sorted into classes for priority consideration.Registrants within the first priority class, claiming family preference,will be randomly selected in a number equal to the shortage number. Ifthis number is insufficient, then registrants in the first priority class,not claiming family preference, will be randomly selected until the shortagenumber is met. If this number is not sufficient to meet the shortage number,the same procedure will be followed for the second priority class untilthe shortage number is reached. (2) Selected registrants will be invitedto file petitions for temporary residence as a RAW. During the petitionprocess, eligibility will be determined and the admission or adjustmentof the alien accomplished. The names of aliens in excess of the initial shortage number requirementswill be retained for possible random selection later in FY 1990, or insubsequent years. Excess cards will be retained until the end of FY 1993.Beyond this time, these registration cards will be destroyed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Filing of Petition for RAW Status </ITAG>The proposed rule envisioned that registered aliens who were selected topetition for RAW status would bring their completed application package,together with the required fee and all supporting documentation, to a Serviceoffice at the time of their scheduled interview. Commentors did not addressthis area of the proposed rule; however, internal staff comments and deliberationon the logistics of the RAW program have led the Service to a finding thatthe RAW program will operate more efficiently and cost-effectively if thereturn of petitions were made to a central location. An exception is madefor the expedited petition process referenced above. Selected registrants will receive a petition package containing all formsand instructions necessary to complete the petition process. The Servicewill also include a pre-addressed return envelope to be used by the petitionerto return the petition, fee and supporting materials to a central locationspecified in the instructions and on the enclosed return envelope. Becauseof government-wide restrictions concerning the use of government frankedmail for return purposes, petitioners must affix the proper postage tothe return envelope.After receipt at the central location, the petition package will be reviewedfor completeness and returned to the alien, without processing, if anydeficiencies are found. Once a properly completed package is received bythe Service, the fee will be processed and a fee receipt sent to the petitioner.The fee receipt will also authorize employment until the date of the interview.An interview will be scheduled according to the petitioner's zip code anda schedule notice will b= mailed to the petitioner.<ITAG tagnum="84">Burden of Proof</ITAG>The proposed rule provided that petitioners must submit documentary proofof qualifying work experience in the form of government records, a varietyof employer or union records, payroll records or income tax returns. Theproposed rule also specifically stated that affidavits cannot be used toestablish the performance of qualifying work.Most industry commentors urged that aliens should be able to submit affidavitsbecause of the difficulty aliens would have in obtaining documents. Manyof these commentors also suggested that the Service not require documents,but approve applicants on the basis of credibility, as determined by speciallytrained officers at the time of interview. They cited the paucity of validemployment documentation in agriculture and the potential for fraud andvictimization of farmworkers by unscrupulous employers and vendors shoulddocuments be required. They further suggested that the oral credibilitydetermination should be made first, with an opportunity for non-crediblepetitioners to submit documentation to rebut a notice of intent to deny.The Service has adopted the suggestion that documents not be required butencourages aliens to bring to the interview documents which would enhancetheir credibility with respect to the performance of qualifying work. Bynot requiring documents to establish performance of qualifying employment,the adjudication of petitions will be expedited.Petitioners who are not able to establish eligibility or the performanceof qualifying work at the interview will have 30 days to rebut an intentto deny with documentary proof, including affidavits. To establish theperformance of qualifying work, only affidavits from employers will beconsidered. Absent credible proof, or after 30 days, the petition wouldbe denied.The Service may attempt to verify any evidence submitted during the petitionprocess that it deems necessary. This ability is inherent on the Service'sauthority to make determinations regarding qualifications and to rendera decision on any application or petition filed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reopening and Reconsideration of Decisions</ITAG>Though not contained in the proposed rule, the Service is concerned thatin some cases temporary resident status could be gained through the useof fraud or willful misrepresentation. The Service's position is that thetemporary resident status improperly gained was<T3> void ab initio,</T3> or never held. Further, the Service believesthat the intent of the Congress would be undermined by allowing temporarystatus improperly held to be retained, and that this would be unfair toother aliens who complied with the requirements. Therefore, the rule containsa provision which empowers the Service to reopen<T3> sua sponte,</T3> reconsider, and render a new decision on any proceedingunder part 210a. This decision may reverse a prior favorable decision whenfraud during the registration or petition processes is determined. If thedecision of the Service, after reconsideration, is to deny a petition orapplication, the petitioner will be accorded the same denial and appealdue process protections provided petitioners whose applications or petitionsare denied.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appeal Process</ITAG>The proposed rule did not contain a provision for administrative appealof denied petitions. Many commentors urged the Service to provide suchdue process to petitioners. The Service is persuaded and will accord deniedpetitioners an administrative appeal through the Director of the RegionalProcessing Facility (RPF) to the Legalization Appeal Unit (LAU). The fee($50.00) and Form I-694 used for the previous two IRCA programs will beretained for use during the RAW program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Confidentiality</ITAG>The proposed rule contained a provision which extended confidentialityto RAW records unless the alien had committed fraud or made a willful misrepresentationof a material fact in connection with the registration and petition processesor if the Service developed information that the alien had entered thecountry illegally after the November 6, 1986 cutoff date stated in theproposal. Many commentors took issue with the exception of informationdeveloped concerning illegal entry and others felt strongly that RAW filesshould be accorded the same grant of strict confidentiality that was providedby statute in the SAW and Legalization programs.The Service wishes to point out that the statute governing the two legalizationprograms contained a clear and unequivocal confidentiality provision whichprecluded use of information contained in these files from being used forany purpose but to make a determination with respect to the applicationand to prosecute persons who committed fraud or made willful misrepresentationof material facts in connection with those application processes. Thereis no similar provision in section 210A of the Act. In the absence of astatutory grant of confidentiality, the Service developed its own versionof the more restrictive standard that appeared in sections 210 and 245A.After reviewing all comments received concerning this issue, the Servicehas modified the confidentiality provision in the interim rule to prohibitthe use of information contained in RAW records for deportation unless:Fraud is discovered during the registration or petition processes; an alienhas failed to maintain status as a RAW; or a person is the subject of anoutstanding arrest warrant.<ITAG tagnum="84">Requirement to Perform Seasonal Agricultural Services</ITAG>The proposed rule states that, upon approval of a petition, the alien willbe granted work authorization for 18 months. Several commentors urged theService to verify the performance of requisite seasonal agricultural servicesevery year for three years. While the Service understands the concernspresented, annual verification does not warrant the costs of the increasedworkload on the Service and the increased traffic through Service offices.The Service believes that verification of the first year's work, plus knowledgethat verifying the next two year's work will occur prior to adjustmentto permanent residence status, combined with the knowledge that failureto perform the required work leads to deportation, should be enough motivationfor an RAW to comply with the statutory work requirement. This provisionwill not be changed.Many commentors pointed out that the proposed rule made permissive theissuance of a subpoena by a district director to obtain employment recordswhich had been refused an alien by an employer. These commentors urgedthat subpoena issuance be made mandatory, consistent with existing regulationsat 8 CFR Part 210. This rule makes the issuance of a subpoena to obtainemployment records denied to an alien mandatory. However, a district directorwill not issue a subpoena until all of the prerequisite conditions havebeen met, including the requirement that the alien must have made reasonableefforts to obtain these required documents. This authority will be usedto assist temporary resident RAWs in establishing performance of the requiredseasonal agricultural services each year, but will not be used to compelthe production of employment records for petitioners.Because section 210A of the Act is silent on provisions for waiver of therequired work in seasonal agricultural services, the proposed rule similarlycontained no language addressing this issue. Several commentors suggestedthat the Service should include provisions in the final rule that providedfor waiver of the requirement in selected situations which were beyondthe control of the RAW. The Service has found legislative history thatwould support such a waiver and has included in the interim rule a provisiondesigned to provide a remedy to aliens who are injured or otherwise disabledafter the date they are adjusted to temporary residence.The proposed rule provided no appeal from a Service determination thata RAW alien was deportable for failure to perform the required work inseasonal agricultural services. Many commentors felt that the Service mustprovide full due process to these RAWs. The Service believes that due processprotections are afforded an alien through the deportation process. Whena Service officer determines that a RAW has failed to perform the workrequired to maintain status, an Order to Show Cause is issued and the alienis entitled to a hearing in the ensuing deportation proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conforming Regulation Changes</ITAG>8 CFR Part 103 establishes the authority of Service officers designatedto administer and make determinations with regard to applications and petitionsfiled pursuant to the Act and 8 CFR. In addition, this part provides authoritiesfor the processing of appeals and waivers, and for the reopening or reconsiderationof any application or petition filed under these same authorities. Theaddition to 8 CFR of a new Part 210a necessitates conforming changes inPart 103.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Issues </ITAG>The Service intends, at the interview, to provide approved RAWs with informationon the dates and locations of the various seasonal agricultural activitiesin the United States. It will refer RAWs to state job service offices forplacement assistance. All state agencies cooperate in the interstate clearancesystem of the United States Employment Service and through this systemRAWs may be directed to areas of greatest need. The Service reiterates its advice in the proposed rule that it is in theinterest of agricultural employers to remain in contact with undocumentedformer workers so that they may contact these workers with necessary informationin the event that the Service announces a registration. The Service also wishes to again note here that it is important for employersto understand that SAWs and RAWs are legal resident aliens and are to betreated as such for tax purposes. They should not be confused with nonimmigranttemporary workers admitted under the H-2A program. Several commentors stated that INS should be able to sanction employersfor noncompliance with the statutory requirement that employers providea certificate of employment in seasonal agricultural services to RAWs.There is no authority for the Service to penalize such employers; however,when it believes that an employer has failed to meet this statutory obligation,the Service will provide evidence of non-compliance to the Department ofLabor, which has such statutory authority. Commentors also stated that the Service should include in the final ruleregulations for certain provisions of section 210A regarding transportationassistance to migrant workers and provisions of the Migrant and SeasonalAgricultural Worker Protection Act (MSAWPA). These provisions are not withinthe jurisdiction of the Service but are within the purview of the Secretaryof Labor, and are addressed in Department of Labor regulations at 29 CFRPart 502. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigrationand Naturalization Service certifies that this rule does not have a significantadverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Thisrule is not a major rule within the meaning of 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nordoes this rule have federalism implications warranting the preparationof a Federal Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.
