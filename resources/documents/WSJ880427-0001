The maker of compressed-air products said Leslie R. Inglis, chief executive officer, Michael L. York, chief operating officer, and Kenneth E. Dubuc, a director since 1984, won seats. From the Hinderliter slate, Richard H. Hughes and Michael A. Lupo won board seats.    Vortec said that among the 68% of the shares held by neither management nor Hinderliter, the vote was more than 5 to 1 in favor of the management slate.    In a statement, Mr. Inglis denounced the Hinderliter group, saying it &quot;waged a campaign of criticism of the company's management, marketing, compensation and other matters. It seems clear to us that most of our shareholders did not agree with their views or find much constructive in their programs for Vortec, and they have overwhelmingly sided with management's vigorous opposition to Hinderliter.&quot;    Hinderliter, a Tulsa, Okla., metals maker and investment concern, had sought to acquire Vortec when it agreed in April to be purchased by closely held Chicago West Pullman Corp., Chicago, in a transaction estimated at $9.9 million. Vortec shareholders are scheduled to vote in June to ratify the agreement. Hinderliter has challenged certain aspects of the Vortec-Chicago West Pullman agreement in U.S. District Court here.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Vortec closed at $4 a share, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
