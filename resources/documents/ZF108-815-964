 The upgraded PhotoMac 1.5 from Data Translation, AdobePhotoshop (see review, July '90, page 53), and Letraset's ColorStudio extendboth the functionality and the ease of bit-mapped-image processing, whetherthe image is a scanned photo, a captured video frame, or an electronicpainting.andM;You can use these programs to make a photo look its best or to createfantastic - yet realistic - montages involving hundreds of separate pictures.andM;PhotoMac, Photoshop, and ColorStudio have the same raison d'etre, but theydiffer in price, user interface, features, and flexibility.andM;To give you a better idea of how these three programs work, I show how eachone handles the major functions of color image-processing software and pointout the differences in how they deal with often-used techniques.andM;I tested the three programs' capabilities by tackling a common problem innewsletter, brochure, and small-magazine publishing: getting a color photo ofa particular subject when working under a tight deadline.andP;  This is asituation in which a color image- retouching application comes into its own.andO;It gives you many tools that let you manipulate what you have into the imageyou want.andM;The objective of my tests was to produce a color photo of a company CEO in acouple of hours.andP;  I started by searching the files for any photographs ofhim.andP;  I found only one in color - a head-and-shoulders snapshot, which wasinappropriate; it would've been better if he had been sitting in his officeor behind a desk.andP;  My next search revealed a color photograph of another manseated behind a desk.andP;  It wasn't a perfect photograph, but it was near enoughto the ideal setting.andP;  ColorStudio, PhotoMac, and Photoshop let you combineelements of two photographs to produce the picture you need.andP;  I used allthree programs to test the capabilities, interface, and features of each.andM;First I scanned both photos (see the scanners lab report, September '90, page132).andP;  Once the images were on-screen, it was easy to see that they each hadseveral problems.andP;  Since they were shot under different lighting, theircontrast and color balance didn't match.andP;  The CEO's picture was a close-upsnapped outdoors in late-afternoon light; the other was shot in the greenishglow of office fluorescent lighting.andP;  The photos were different sizes andneeded to be scaled to matching proportions.andP;  The snapshot of the CEO wasdirty and wrinkled, and the skin flaws were too obvious.andP;  The walldecorations and other paraphernalia behind the seated man were focusedsomewhat more sharply than he was, drawing attention away from him.andM;To retouch the photographs' flaws and to manipulate the images, I needed touse four basic photo-retouching techniques: darkroom procedures, retouching,pictorial effects, and image compositing.andM;Darkroom procedures include adjusting the color balance and settingbrightness and contrast, which are also referred to as gamma controls.andO;Retouching involves adding detail, controlling sharpness, and eliminatingblemishes.andP;  Pictorial effects allow you to alter an image's style - you canmake a photo look like a pointillist painting, for example, or make itpartially negative.andP;  Image compositing is creating a new picture from two ormore existing images.andM;Darkpoom ProceduresandM;Image-processing programs are known as electronic darkrooms because theymimic - indeed extend - the controls used in traditional photographicprintmaking, such as those that balance colors, highlights, and shadows.andM;The first step in combining the pictures is to match their overall colorbalance by adjusting the red, green, and blue values of each picture so thatthe two correspond to each other.andP;  It is also necessary to match the twopictures' brightness; contrast; and tonal range, or gamma curve.andM;Adjusting the color balance, contrast, and brightness with animage-processing program is enough to dramatically improve an image'sappearance.andP;  And because you generally get instant feedback on the results,even a novice can learn how to use these controls quickly.andP;  In addition, yousave considerable turn-around time and money by doing your custom photoprocessing in-house, especially if the photos need retouching.andM;Although it is often necessary to heighten photographs' contrast to adddrama, it is important not to get carried away, because too much contrast canobscure details of highlight and shadow.andP;  By using color-balance controls,you can alter the orange cast that appears in photos shot at sunrise or thegreenish cast that appears in pictures shot under fluorescent lights.andP;  Youselect a specific area and then use the color-balance controls to play down,eliminate, or replace colors.andP;  This color-balancing technique also works fortinting or colorizing black-and-white photos.andM;Photoshop and ColorStudio give you the option of arbitrary gamma control,which lets you manually control the hue (color), saturation (intensity), andvalue (brightness) of colors in specific portions of an image's gamma curve.andO;Arbitrary gamma control lets you add drama to a picture by boosting contrastin the middle tones while maintaining detail in the deep shadows and brighthighlights.andP;  Being able to control a color's hue, saturation, and value makesit possible to tint the picture or replace one color with another in aselected area.andP;  You can use arbitrary gamma controls to create severaleffects, including posterizing, which involves reducing or eliminating therange of shading in each color so that all colors are flat.andP;  If you want touse the image as a template for tracing, you can use arbitrary gamma controlsto reduce large areas to solid colors, simplifying tracing.andM;All three color programs can reverse each color to its complement (the hueopposite it on a color wheel), so you can directly convert a scanned filmnegative to its true-color positive version.andP;  Only PhotoMac, however, can doit while compensating for the orange mask usually present on color negativefilm, such as Kodacolor.andP;  If you try to convert a scanned color negative inColorStudio or Photoshop, you'll have to correct the color manually toeliminate the orange mask.andM;The last darkroom procedure is to scale the two images to the sameproportions and to rotate them if necessary.andM;RetouchingandM;Once I had set the color balance and completed the equivalent of conventionaldarkroom work on my two example images, it was much easier to retouch smallflaws in the photos.andP;  There were several in the portrait: a white speck onthe subject's lip, ruddy and blotchy skin, and uncombed hair.andM;The traditional techniques for repairing these flaws would require severalexpensive hours of an airbrush artist's time, even if the photos were onlyblack-and-white.andP;  The methods for retouching color by hand are even morepainstaking and costly.andM;With &quot;electronic darkrooms,&quot; repairing small imperfections simply meanspainting over them or blending them into the background.andP;  With experience,you can use painting and blending techniques to accomplish even moreelaborate retouching, such as removing a coffee stain or getting rid of treebranches that appear to be growing out of a subject's head.andM;The trick is to retouch the photo so that the results look natural - or atleast don't draw attention to your handiwork.andP;  This skill requires practice:Painting over subtle shading changes with a flat or slightly mismatched colorcan make the cure worse than the disease.andP;  If you're a beginner, you'll needto take some time to learn and practice the kind of retouching you see in mysample photos.andP;  Once you have the skills, however, a job like this one takesonly about an hour - or less with the brush-blending, tinting, andtransparency options in ColorStudio and Photoshop.andM;Image-processing software provides tools for picking up colors and texturepatterns, such as wood grain, hair, or grass, making it relatively easy tomatch precisely the colors and shades of the areas surrounding a defect.andO;With Photoshop and ColorStudio, you can pick up whole parts of an image andthen brush them into another area.andP;  Where possible, I used this technique torepair the CEO's skin blotches, remove shadows, and fill in the hairline.andM;To make a touch-up unobtrusive, you have to blend its edges into itssurroundings.andP;  Virtually all image-processing-software toolboxes containbrushes for smudging, blurring, or sharpening edges.andP;  Photoshop andColorStudio also give you the option of automating all brush-stroke blending.andO;Both applications let you specify the degree of anti-aliasing (shading pixeledges to make diagonal lines appear smooth rather than jagged) and feathering(making the edges of a selection slightly translucent so that it mergessmoothly with the area onto which it's placed).andP;  You can also use a brush tolighten, darken, or tint an area.andP;  Photoshop and ColorStudio let you specifythat your brush color be used only on colors lighter or darker than it.andP;  Allthree programs let you specify the degree of transparency of colors.andM;To prepare the portrait for pasting into the office setting, I decided toeliminate the portrait's background.andP;  ColorStudio, PhotoMac, and Photoshopmake this easy by letting you reverse a selection - that is, you can deselectwhat's currently selected and select what was previously unselected.andP;  All Ineeded to do was carefully lasso the subject's head, reverse the selection,and press the Delete key to delete the background and isolate the head.andM;Image CompositingandM;Once I had made the two photos look their best, I needed to combine them intoone picture.andP;  The camera may never lie, but image-processing applications cansure make it look as if it did.andP;  Giving a jogger the feet of a jackrabbit orplacing the Taj Majal in Times Square are well within these programs' scope.andM;Image compositing is the most complicated of the four image-processingfunctions.andP;  It requires at least four steps: selecting, cutting,manipulating, and pasting.andM;Although the process of creating an intricate composite can be challenging atfirst, the basic techniques are fairly easy to apply.andP;  In this case, Iseamlessly replaced Mr. X's head with the CEO's head.andP;  I laid the foundationfor this step at the darkroom stage by scaling and rotating the two images sothat they would fit together and by making them match in color and intensity.andM;To create my composite image (also known as a photomontage), I opened bothfiles simultaneously-which is possible in all three applications - and thenselected the CEO's head and neck, copied it to the Clipboard, switched to theoffice-setting file, and pasted the Clipboard image in.andP;  The CEO's headfloated above the office scene until I dragged it to the right place anddeselected it, dropping it permanently into position.andM;Depending on how carefully you have outlined the selection in a situationlike this, you may have to do some retouching such as smudging togetherpoorly matching edges, reconstructing a detail that got lopped off during theoriginal copy operation, or taking other steps to make the pasted item blendnaturally with the background.andP;  In a simple case such as this, blending is noproblem.andP;  In compositing several images, however, the way a program allowsyou to blend selections becomes vital (see the &quot;Selecting and Masking&quot;sidebar).andM;Both ColorStudio and Photoshop have very powerful masking abilities.andP;  Maskinguses one or more layers to protect or affect specific portions of an imageand even specific aspects of an image, such as color only or brightness only.andO;The extent of a photo-retouching program's masking abilities is a goodmeasure of its overall power and of the time you save when using it.andM;All three applications allow users to specify the transparency of pastes andfills.andP;  Transparent fills let you quickly add shadows to combined images tomake the combination look natural and unified.andP;  A transparent fill isespecially effective in combination with feathering or gradient-shape fillsin making the edges of shadows fade out.andP;  (A gradient fill smoothly blendsthe shading of two or more colors over a specified distance.andP;  Agradient-shape fill makes the blended tones conform to the shape of theselected area.)andM;To get finished composites to look realistic, you often have to rotate,slant, and size incoming images to match the target photo's perspectivebefore the final pastedown.andP;  Photoshop and ColorStudio let you type precisevertical and horizontal dimensions to specify sizes and exact degrees ofrotation.andP;  Photoshop also has on-screen rulers, which are a big help whenyou're scaling a selection to fit precisely into its place in the underlyingimage.andM;Sometimes you need to combine two or more images created in differentapplications or on different computers.andP;  The three image-manipulationapplications make combination possible without the dramatic shifts in colorthat result when the images' color palettes do not match.andP;  There are twotrue-color models: One is the cyan, magenta, yellow, black (CMYK) model, inwhich colors are created by combinations of cyan, magenta, yellow, and blackand which is used for images that are printed on light-reflecting media suchas paper.andP;  The other model is RGB (red, green, blue), in which all colors arecombinations of red, green, and blue; it is used for images that are viewedby transmitted light, such as on a monitor, TV, or color slide (see &quot;ColorTechniques and Technologies,&quot; May '90, Buyer's Guide, page 4).andM;Typically, CMYK is best for images that are to be conventionally printed,because it matches the number and colors of the printing plates used and itenables you to deal with printing houses.andP;  It's desirable for animage-retouching program to work in these and several other color models sothat it can adapt to your working style and output needs.andM;Finally, if you want to put images together, it should be easy to import theminto the color-retouching application you use.andP;  As long as the image is aTIFF, PICT, or PICT2 file, you won't have any trouble.andM;Of the three, Photoshop has the most-flexible options for file conversion,making it possible to send images to and from almost every popular graphicsfile format for either the Mac or DOS machines.andM;Pictorial EffectsandM;The fourth and easiest part of using image-processing software is producingpictorial effects.andP;  The most common effects let you blur, sharpen, orposterize; you can also get interesting results by using filters, whichchange an image or selection's style by altering the relationship of onepixel's color and size to another's.andM;A filter that &quot;adds noise,&quot; for example, gives images a high-contrast,grainy, &quot;documentary&quot; look; a filter that makes small shaded areas look likedabbed brush strokes gives them a painterly look.andM;With 22 options on its menu plus five third-party filters, Photoshop is thespecialist in pictorial effects.andP;  Both Photoshop and ColorStudio acceptplug-in filters from third-party vendors, and Photoshop lets you create yourown filters.andM;Using obvious pictorial effects, such as posterizing or mosaic patterning,would have been inappropriate for the composite portrait of the CEO.andO;Instead, I blurred the background slightly to make the subject seem moreprominent.andM;All in all, I was able to produce a usable image out of materials at handwith a little experience and a minimum of effort and expense.andM;Ratouching fop EveryoneandM;Adobe's Photoshop is a good product for all levels of image retouching.andP;  Ithas an intuitive and easy-to-learn interface, even for new users, and itsextensive arsenal of tools and features makes it possible to produce justabout any effect.andM;Letraset's ColorStudio is a more complex product.andP;  Its market is graphicsprofessionals, especially in the prepress arena, who desire precise controlover every aspect of the darkroom, retouching, and output process.andP;  It hasespecially strong retouching options, such as blending and masking.andP;  At justunder $2,000, ColorStudio is clearly aimed at the professional prepressmarket.andP;  By the time you read this, Shapes, an annex to ColorStudio, shouldbe available.andP;  It will let you import illustrations from EPS images.andP;  You canwork with objects in the drawing layer as you would in any PostScript drawingpackage.andM;PhotoMac from Data Translation is a sound, reasonably priced product foranyone with occasional and straightforward photo-manipulation needs.andP;  Itsbasic selection of darkroom, retouching, and photo-montage techniques allowsyou to quickly and easily prepare images for publication.andM;Ken Milburn, a former advertising and editorial photographer, writes aboutMac and IBM computer graphics.andM;Selecting and MaskingandM;Often the elements you want to alter in an image are irregularly shaped andhave vague edges, so hand-tracing with the lasso tool can be painstaking andsubject to errors.andP;  When buying an image-retouching program, you need toconsider its flexibility in isolating areas of images.andP;  Not only doesflexibility allow you to get a more professional finish, but accurate areaselection makes spot color easier to apply.andM;ColorStudio, PhotoMac, and Photoshop all have auto-select tools that let youprecisely select hard-to-trace shapes simply by clicking on them.andP;  You candetermine how much of a selection the tool affects by setting a range oftones and then clicking within that selection.andP;  Any contiguous pixels withtonal values that fall within the designated range are automaticallyselected.andM;The three programs differ, however, in the flexibility and ease with whichyou can set auto-select options.andP;  You can set PhotoMac's options by draggingthe Autoselect tool across as many tones as you want to include - easy to do,but you also tend to pick up tones you don't want.andM;In Photoshop, you type a range into the selection tool's dialog box, whichallows you to define only a brightness range with values from 1 to 256, notspecific colors.andM;ColorStudio lets you type in several choices in the Options dialog box,including Exact Color, Exact Mask, Close Hues, and Value (brightness) Range.andO;In addition, you can specify ranges of colors to select by example andthrough a dialog box.andP;  This plethora of methods gives professionals plenty offlexibility but is likely to intimidate novices.andM;No auto-select tool can choose exactly the area you want every time.andO;Fortunately, all these packages let you manually add to or subtract from aselection.andP;  In addition, these programs can automatically feather or blend aselection's edges so that when you paste in a Clipboard image, you can getaround hand-retouching ragged edges and avoid sharp breaks in shade ortonality.andM;ColorStudio and Photoshop allow you to control numerous edge-blendingelements.Theseinclude border depth (the number of pixels adjacent to theselection marquee that will be blended with those in the border of theunderlying image), edge vignette (how gradually the selection's border fadesto transparent), and blending with underlying shades (the number of pixelsused in the dithered pattern that blends the selection border with thebackground).andM;Another helpful technique in all aspects of image retouching is masking.andO;Masks delineate an area so that you can't accidentally alter it.andP;  In PhotoMacand Photoshop, everything but a selected area automatically becomes a mask.andO;Photoshop has a command that lets you paste into or behind a selection andlets you store masks permanently in as many as 13 separate 8-bit (256-color)layers.andM;ColorStudio has its own approach to masking.andP;  There is a single mask layerfor the image, but a separate mask accompanies all incoming Clipboard images.andO;You can use the mask from the Clipboard, the original's, or both.andP;  This letsyou use the selection's mask and the document's mask in a variety ofcombinations by including the masked regions of the selection and thedocument in the final effect or excluding them.andM;The AlternativesandM;Do you -and your budget- really need all the features and options that colorimage-processing programs provide? After all, paint programs such asSuperMac's PixelPaint Professional, Deneba's UltraPaint, and Electronic Arts'Studio/32 generally cost less and have many similar capabilities.andM;These three paint programs feature versatile brushes that can smudge,lighten, darken, and pick up color.andP;  PixelPaint Professional has specialEmboss and Trace Edges features.andP;  But most paint programs have no usercontrols for overall color balance and contrast.andP;  UltraPaint is theexception, but it lets you change only overall lightness and contrast and itdoesn't work with 16-or 24-bit-color images.andM;Paint programs are getting better at the business of image creation andpainting, but they aren't optimized to do photo retouching.andP;  They can't blendor smooth as subtly, and it's virtually impossible to do color balancing withthem.andM;Paint and photo-retouching applications make good partners: Paint programscan each help in their own way with retouching spots, blending edges, andeven combining multiple images.andP;  Indeed, they may well suit your needs fullyif you don't need to balance brightness, contrast, and color or go directlyto high-end prepress.andP;  You can also use them to compensate for the creativeweaknesses of a high-end retouching program.andM;Gray-Scale RetouchingandM;If you work only with gray-scale images, you don't need an image-retouchingapplication with color capabilities.andP;  Retouching gray-scale images requiresmany of the same tools as color-image manipulation does, but it avoids thecomplexity of dealing with separate color layers.andM;Early versions of gray-scale editors displayed only 64 or 128 shades of gray,but current versions show the complete range of 256 shades of gray possiblein an 8-bit image.andP;  Unless you plan to work with 24-bit-color images, any oneof the applications mentioned here should fit your needs.andM;Digital Darkroom II is the current version of Silicon Beach Software'spioneering image-editing application.andP;  Digital Darkroom introduced innovativefeatures such as the magic-wand tool, which makes selections based on graylevels, and transparent pasting, which for the first time let users blend apasted selection into a target image (see Figure A).andP;  Digital Darkroom alsointroduced gray-level masking, which locks all the pixels of a particularshade or range of gray, preventing them from being altered while the mask isin effect, And Digital Darkroom was the first package to offer an auto-tracefunction, converting gray-scale images to a collection of Bezier-curveoutlines that you can edit in applications such as Adobe Illustrator or AldusFreeHand.andM;Digital Darkroom displays 256 shades of gray, although its palette has only128 grays, and can open only one image at a time.andP;  It can save images inPICT2, TIFF (1-bit dithered, halftone, advanced halftone, and gray-scale),ThunderScan, MacPaint, and its own compressed archive format, and it canexport its auto-traced objects as Illustrator-compatible PostScript files.andO;It can open files in PICT, TIFF (1-bit, halftone, and gray-scale), MacPaint,and ThunderScan format.andP;  Version 1.1 adds an Image Preview feature, whichdisplays a thumbnail version of the image in the Open dialog box and showsthe size and resolution of the image.andM;Unlike the other gray-scale editors, Enhance 1.01 from Micro Frontierrequires System 6.03 and 32-bit Color QuickDraw, even though it's limited toworking with 8-bit images.andP;  Enhance is more than a gray-scaleeditor-it's alsoan 8-bit-color editor, and it sports a respectable set of image-analysistools.andM;Enhances's main benefit is its speed: Its filter operations are much fasterthan those of any of the other applications.andP;  It also offers sophisticatedcontrast and brightness controls, including gamma correction.andM;Enhance lets you use up to three image buffers per image, so you can use onefor the original image, one for the altered image, and the third for masking.andO;Area masking is quite simple - it changes only the mask's black pixels.andP;  Youcan use area masks in painting and in pasting operations.andP;  Enhance's varioustool options let you designate gray levels (or ranges of levels) on which thetools will have no effect, providing a second level of masking (see FigureB).andM;Enhance has a nonstandard interface, but context-sensitive help is alwaysavailable.andP;  You can open up to four images at once, making it good formontage work.andP;  It can open PICT, TIFF (compressed and uncompressed), and textfiles, and it can save images as PICT, TIFF, text, or EPS files.andM;Image is a public-domain software package written by Wayne Rasband of theNational Institutes of Health.andP;  It's primarily a tool for numerical analysisof scientific and medical images, but it has some useful features for photoretouching, such as contrast enhancement and gray-level equalization, whichallows you to change the distribution of gray levels.andP;  it also containsfilters for sharpening, blurring, tracing edges, and reducing noise (seeFigure C).andM;Image directly supports two frame-grabber cards for acquiring images fromvideo sources: The Data Translation QuickCapture card and the imageSystemsTechnology Video image 1000.andP;  With the latter card, it can captureframes in real time at 30 frames per second.andM;Letraset's imageStudio was the first full-fledged image-processing packagefor the Mac.andP;  It introduced the fingertip (smear) tool and the water-drop(blur) tool.andP;  It was also the first application to offer masking and basicfilters for sharpening, blurring, and diffusing, lmageStudio favors toolssuch as brushes, fingertip, and water drop over more-technical controls (seeFigure D).andM;ImageStudio 1.5 displays all 256 shades of gray, but it has a palette of only16 grays plus black for editing.andP;  You can define which shades of gray appearin the palette by entering a percentage, or you can select the gray shade youneed from the image surface itself.andM;ImageStudio's masking options are limited to protecting the current selectionfrom modification, and it lacks some amenities such as auto-scrolling and theability to open multiple documents.andP;  ImageStudio is also particularly weak inselection-handling abilities, lacking a polygon, an oval, andselection-refinement options.andP;  It's also unable to rotate a selected areaarbitrarily.andP;  It does, however, offer a wide range of brush effects,including the ability to paint on only lighter or darker pixels than thecurrently selected shade.andP;  There's also a Fade option that mimics a brush'srunning out of paint at the end of a stroke.andM;ImageStudio can open files in uncompressed TIFF, MacPaint.andP;  ThunderScan, andLetraset's own RIFF format.andP;  It can save images as RIFF, TIFF, MacPaint, orEPS files.andM;Blue Solutions' PhotoPress is a straightforward gray-scale editor with8-bit-color capabilities.andP;  It can open and save PICT2 and uncompressed TIFFimages.andP;  The number of open images is limited only by available RAM.andP;  Itlacks Digital Darkroom's and Enhance's sophisticated gray-level masking andvariable paste operations.andP;  However.. it offers workable area masking; auser-definable gray map; and a useful set of filters, including Dither (toproduce a high-quality black-and-white image), Focus.andP;  Soften, and Blend (seeFigure E).andM;PhotoPress can convert color images to gray-scale and gray-scale images toblack-and-white line art.andP;  PhotoPress has one unique feature: a Slide Showcommand that lets you view several images one after the other.andM;All the applications mentioned here offer good control over halftoning,including screen frequency and angle, and a choice of line or dot screens.andM;The Bottom LineandM;To test the interface, features, and ease of use of Adobe Photoshop, PhotoMacfrom DataTranslation, and ColorStudio from Letraset, a couple of scannedphotos were retouched and a composite image was created for publication.andM;Adobe Photoshop ($895) has more power than most of us ever need, but it makesit all accessible and largely discoverable by the broadest range of users.andO;It neither overpowers the novice nor bores the master.andM;PhotoMac ($795) offers respectable power and a straightforward interface.andM;ColorStudio  $1,995), firmly aimed at high-end users, is not nearly ascomfortable to work with as PhotoMac or Photoshop, although, oddly, it hastool modes that are clearly not for photo retouching but, rather, for playfuland creative color work.andP;  Its power focuses on numerically precise colorcontrol and output.andP;  (TABULAR DATA OMITTED)</TEXT></DOC>
