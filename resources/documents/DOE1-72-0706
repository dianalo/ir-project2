<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-72-0706 </DOCNO><TEXT>A recent paper by Mothersill and Seymour (1987), and its precursor bySeymour et al. (1986), prompt several comments. The points the lettermakes are: (1) the dose-dependence of lethal mutations, or lethal sectoring,in a developing colony can depend upon the cells in question and/or thecell culture conditions which may apply; (2) lethal mutation probablydepends upon radiation quality; (3) damage which may give rise to lethalmutations is very likely reparable; and (4) the dose-dependence of thefrequency of induction of the neoplastic transformation of C3H 10T1/2mouse cells, normalized to surviving cells, is probably not influencedby lethal mutations. The reply discusses the distinction between initiationand expression of transformation.</TEXT></DOC>
