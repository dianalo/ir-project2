A regulation implementing section 123 waspromulgated on February 8, 1982 (47 FR 5864). Revisions to the regulationwere published on July 8, 1985 (50 FR 27892).<ITAG tagnum="84">State Implementation Plan Requirements</ITAG>Pursuant to section 406(d)(2) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977,USEPA is requiring that all States (1) review and revise, as necessary,their SIP to include provisions that limit stack height credits and dispersiontechniques in accordance with USEPA's July 8, 1985, revised regulationsand (2) review all existing emission limitations to determine whether anyof these limitations have been affected by impermissible stack height creditsabove GEP or by any other dispersion techniques. For any limitations thathave been so affected, States are required to prepare revised limitationsconsistent with their revised SIP. All SIP revisions and revised emissionlimitations were required to be submitted to USEPA within 9 months of promulgationof the July 8, 1985, revised stack height regulations.Today's notice addresses the State's Stack Height Regulations developedto include provisions in the Ohio SIP that limit stack height credits anddispersion techniques in accordance with USEPA's July 8, 1985, regulations.This action is potentially subject to review and modification after USEPAfinalizes its response to the decision in <T3>NRDC v. Thomas, </T3>838 F.2d 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Any revised limitationsfor sources in Ohio will be addressed at a later time in a separate <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice.On March 3, 1986, Ohio EPA submitted GEP Stack Height Regulations for inclusionin the State Implementation Plan. These regulations were adopted by theState on February 12, 1986, and became effective on March 5, 1986. On May6, 1987 (52 FR 16877), USEPA proposed to approve Ohio's regulations. USEPA'sproposed approval was based on the State regulations being the same orsimilar to the Federal regulations with a few exceptions. Only one exception(i.e., definition of emission limitation and emission standard) was consideredsignificant enough to require further clarification from the State. Thisclarification was submitted to USEPA on September 2, 1987. No other publiccomments were submitted on USEPA's proposed action.In the September 2, 1987 letter, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency(OEPA) informed USEPA that it intended the State definition of ``emissionstandard or emission limitation'' to be consistent with the Federal definition.The only difference between the State and Federal language is that theFederal definition states that the limits or standards apply on a continuousbasis and will assure continuous emission reduction. In its comment letter,OEPA noted that emission limits developed by their Agency'' * * * applyon a continuous basis * * *''. As such, Ohio felt that the additional languagein the Federal definition was unnecessary. USEPA accepts this clarificationto the State's definition of emission limitation and emission standardand is incorporating this letter by reference into the SIP.As discussed in the notice of proposed rulemaking, the State definitionsare generally identical to the Federal requirements. In the tables below,the State definitions are compared to the Federal definitions. Based onthis comparison, the State regulations are approvable.I.
