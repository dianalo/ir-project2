Gorbachev displayed solid supportSunday for reform in Eastern Europe by endorsing socialism with a``human face'' _ the slogan used by the Czechoslovak progressivestoppled by a Soviet-led invasion in 1968.   In the Czechoslovak capital, Alexander Dubcek, leader of theill-fated ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 21 years ago, readGorbachev's remarks at a rally as proof of the Soviet president'sbacking for change.   Two days earlier, the Czechoslovak Communist Party dumped partychief Milos Jakes and some other leaders associated with hard-linepolicies in an attempt to stem the political crisis that has rockedthe country.   With the East bloc in upheaval, the Soviet Communist Party dailyPravda published a 2{-page compilation of Gorbachev's thoughts onthe future of socialism and his own program for ``perestroika,'' orreconstruction of the economy and society.   Pravda said the article was a synthesis of recent remarks byGorbachev.   The Soviet leader's major theme seemed to be that socialism mustmodernize _ even adopt traits of capitalism if necessary _ or riskbecoming irrelevant. He offered no quick answers but said theprocess would take years, ``into the 21st century.''   He also said achievements attained under capitalism, like``equality of all before the law'' and general prosperity, shouldnot be dismissed because of ideology.   ``In the hullabaloo of our constant confrontation withcapitalism, we clearly underestimate the importance of much thathas been done by humanity over the centuries,'' the Kremlin leadersaid.   On the need for Soviet reform, Gorbachev said: ``The people aretired of waiting.   ``Many words have been spoken about the interests of man, butthey have been little reinforced with material resources andgenuine deeds. As a result, in becoming a great and mighty power,the country did not create for the masses of the people theconditions of life that are natural for any civilized state.''   ``The new face of socialism is its human face, this fullycorresponds to the thought of Marx,'' Gorbachev said. ``Because itscreation is the chief goal of restructuring, we can with fulljustification say we are building humanitarian socialism.''   For Communists, the phrase ``socialism with a human face'' isinseparably linked to Dubcek and his ill-fated reform movement.Gorbachev has previously supported economic and social reform inEastern Europe and pledged the Soviets would not interfere there,but by appropriating Dubcek's words, he made his point dramatically.   Some in Prague even took Gorbachev's comments as a publicadmission that the 1968 intervention, which led to Dubcek'soverthrow, was a mistake. The Soviet Union has not yet renouncedthe 1968 intervention, as it has the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.   As recently as last year, the Kremlin was vigorously defendingthe intervention in Czechoslovakia as necessary to block``anti-socialist forces.'' Soviets also avoided any comparisonsbetween what Dubcek tried to do and perestroika. ``The differenceis 20 years,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov oncesaid laconically.   In the Pravda article, Gorbachev sounded a note of alarm aboutsocialism by contrasting its present woes with the adaptibility ofcapitalism.   Karl Marx was wrong, Gorbachev acknowledged, when he predictedcapitalism's imminent demise.   ``Unfortunately, socialism has not been able to occupy theleader's position in structural reconversion _ industriallydeveloped capitalist countries have apppeared in this role,''Gorbachev said.   He said much of value was created under capitalism _ ``not justsimple norms of morality and justice, but principles of formal law,i.e. equality of all before the law, laws and liberties of theindividual, principles of the production of goods and equivalentexchange based on the law of value.''   Gorbachev defended the 1917 revolution that brought theCommunists to power in the former Russian Empire as a``world-historical breakthrough to the future,'' but said socialismhas often been perverted since.   ``For the sake of a wrongly understood collectivism, humanindividuality was ignored, the development of the personality wasslowed,'' he said.   He also seemed to defend his reforms from charges they lack aclear blueprint, citing the precedent of Soviet founder VladimirLenin.   ``There is a deep-seated belief that Lenin supposedly had acompleted program for the development of socialism in our country.But in fact he had no such completed program,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
