The British financial-services group said profit after taxes but before extraordinary items surged 122%, to #67.5 million from #30.4 million, while sales gained 113%, to #919.7 million ($1.72 billion) from #432.4 million.    British andamp; Commonwealth took a #14.6 million charge to amortize the amount paid above book value in the 1986 acquisitions of Exco and Woodchester Investments. The charge wasn't expected and left pretax profit below the range of #140 million to #150 million that analysts had forecast. British andamp; Commonwealth fell 12 pence (22.5 cents), to 271 pence, on London's stock exchange yesterday.    Chairman John Gunn said: &quot;The company has made great progress in making the radical changes that we consider necessary. There remains a lot to do.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
