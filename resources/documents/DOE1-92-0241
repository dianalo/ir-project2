A Harwell's group has determinedoxygen generated from aqueous ferrous solutions irradiated with heavyions and concluded that the oxygen is a precursor of perhydroxy radicals.The LET-dependent yields for perhydroxy radical have been determinedby LaVerne and Schuler; the analysis of their results sheds light intothe reactions taking place in high-LET track cores. In conjunction withthese results, the possible contributions to the LET effects are pointedout and discussed of the energetic secondary electrons ejected from thetrack core by knock-on collision with heavy ions and of the variationin the track core size with energy of the heavy particles.</TEXT></DOC>
