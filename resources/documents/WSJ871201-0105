KarrStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LABORELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE)LABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Labor Department proposed rules aimed at reducing the chance of death or injury for many employees who work near electrical equipment.    The regulations proposed by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration would cover about 4.8 million workers in the manufacturing, transportation, retail and wholesale trade, finance and service industries.    The rules would require training in how to work near electrical equipment, that power be turned off or protective guards used when employees work with such equipment, and that workers be alerted to electrical hazards by signs or other means. Other requirements would include minimum distances for vehicles operating near live power lines and specific guidelines for using electrical equipment.    The proposed regulations primarily would cover workers whose jobs don't require extensive work with electrical equipment or power lines, and who are unfamiliar with their specific dangers. It generally wouldn't apply to such &quot;qualified persons&quot; as electricians, workers engaged in telecommunications, and those who install or operate equipment used for power generation, transmission and distribution.    The rules wouldn't apply to the construction and maritime industries, which have special electrical-hazard problems such as frequently changing work locations. Asked if rules for those industries are under consideration, an OSHA spokeswoman said the White House budget office won't allow the department to comment on that subject.    Though electricians generally aren't covered by the proposed rules, OSHA said their occupation is among those with the highest electrical-accident rates, along with electrical apprentices, certain engineers, mechanics, repairmen, structural-metal craftsmen and welders.    The Centers for Disease Control, a unit of the Health and Human Services Department, recently issued a study showing that among 3,700 industrial workers in Texas, electricians accounted for 47% of occupational electrocutions, ranking highest among work groups.    Diane Factor, an industrial hygienist for the AFL-CIO, noted that the OSHA proposal would involve &quot;performance-oriented&quot; requirements, which give employers wide latitude in how they comply. She said such standards usually lack strict safety-oriented language, suggesting the rules might not be sufficient for the problem.    OSHA said public comments on the proposed new rules are due by next Feb. 29, before the agency decides whether to adopt the proposal. </TEXT></DOC>
