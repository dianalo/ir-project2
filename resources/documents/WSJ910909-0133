David Rieff, in his sometimesilluminating, often maddening book says, &quot;To most of thecountry, but particularly New York, Los Angeles {is} afantasy, a place that exists everywhere except in real space. . . populated with myths rather than citizens.&quot;   But as Mr. Rieff himself shows in &quot;Los Angeles: Capital ofthe Third World&quot; (Simon andamp; Schuster, 259 pages, $20), the cityis changing at such an astonishing rate that assumptions ofthat sort are outdated. Los Angeles is no longer &quot;Iowa by thesea.&quot; Nor is it anymore a place so achingly beautiful thatAmericans once flocked there to find earthly paradise. Ifit's anything, these days, it's Central America North or AsiaEast. That change, and what it holds for the future, is thesubject of this book. The reasons for the change, like theold joke about the three rules of real estate, are:immigration, immigration and immigration. Mr. Rieff knowsthat the water shortage, the traffic problems, theover-building, the near-collapse of the Unified SchoolDistrict, and perhaps even the troubles the Dodgers arehaving, grow from that issue.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Rieff is a New Yorker who spent part of his childhoodin Los Angeles. He returned for several months in 1989 togather information for this book. He has read widely andapplied his interesting mind to the large problems andquestions that confront the nation's second largest city.   Los Angeles is rapidly on its way to becoming a city witha Latino and Asian majority. Since Southern California wasonce part of Mexico, maybe that's fitting. The old uneasycoalition of Anglo- and Afro-American citizens may soon beirrelevant. Further, Los Angeles may already be a place inwhich more people don't pay taxes than do. Of course,everyone uses public services.   To live here is to know that Los Angeles is becoming avast sea of the undocumented and the illegal. Many of themwork hard; some even spend their money here. Many try to sendit out of the country, mostly to Mexico and Latin America.Perhaps to underscore the contrast between the poor and thewell-to-do, or to express his solidarity with the underclass,Mr. Rieff is tough on the gentry. His view might becharacterized as neo-Marxist. It feeds off the idea thatL.A., like capitalism itself, has always been based on thenotion of expansion and development. But that belief, socentral to our national history, may well have gone as far asit can here.   Mr. Rieff points out that this wave of immigrants isdifferent from the Europeans who came to New York around1900. That group, my grandparents among them, were determinedto assimilate. That is different from the situation inSouthern California today. For many reasons, not the least ofwhich is that immigrants from Mexico can go home forholidays, assimilation is not so much a goal as something tobe wary of. In parts of East Los Angeles, it is said, thereare third-generation residents -- citizens of this country bybirth -- who speak only Spanish.   Mr. Rieff's achievement is tracing and illuminating thissituation. He is neither an anthropologist nor a historian.Rather, he is an observer and analyst of what is around him.He is, not surprisingly, critical of Los Angeles's West Side-- the high-rent district and home of the inflated realestate market, where politicians from all over the countrycome to raise money. Mr. Rieff calls this part of town thepleasure dome. He believes that the cushy life he perceivesthere is run on the backs of illegal immigrants who are allbut ignored by their masters -- who are busy discussingGerman reunification.   L.A.'s West Side is certainly open to criticism andsatire, but Mr. Rieff's picture seems neither fair norrevealing. Breezy references to Coleridge notwithstanding,his characterization of West Siders at home is drawn with aheavy hand. It is a commonplace, easily observed, that thoseWest Siders are involved in the lives of their employees --helping them with their papers, finding computers for theirschool-age kids, guiding them through bureaucratic thickets.This might be noblesse oblige, but it is necessary and it isdone without much comment. My evidence is anecdotal, but thatis also Mr. Rieff's approach.   The book is marred by a number of minor historicalinaccuracies and odd characterizations. Mr. Rieff seems tothink that what I take to be Santa Monica Canyon is called&quot;Croissant Canyon.&quot; Nobody I know has ever heard that phrase.He also believes that when locals avoid the freeways, we callthat &quot;going surface.&quot;   But his large conclusion -- that Los Angeles is a dividedcity and that so long as heads stay in the sand about theparticularly modern nature of immigration, no good will comeof all our hopes for the future, is clearly set forth. Thefurther point, implicit in his argument, is that Los Angeles,long the point city for trends and change, is likely to be aharbinger for this sort of urban population shift. Like theinternational currencies that in time of trouble rush to thedollar for shelter, Third World refugees run to the U.S. LosAngeles is not the only city they will call home.   ---   Mr. Freeman is the author of &quot;A Hollywood Life.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
