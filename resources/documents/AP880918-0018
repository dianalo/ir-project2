Gen. Prosper Avril declaredhimself president of Haiti on Sunday after ousting the nation'sleader, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, in a military coup.   In an address on national television early Sunday morning, Avrilsaid the Presidential Guard he commands had toppled Namphy onSaturday because it was ``sickened'' by the way Haiti had beengoverned.   Earlier Saturday, residents reported hearing heavy gunfire nearthe presidential palace in what appeared to be fighting betweenmilitary factions.   Namphy was head of the armed forces, while Avril commanded thePresidential Guard, a 1,000-man force responsible for protectingthe presidential palace.   The coup came less than a week after Hurricane Gilbert, one ofthe most powerful storms on record, lashed Haiti and killed about30 people.   Avril, a former adviser to President Jean-Claude Duvalier, saidHaiti will respect all international treaties, liberties and humanrights and said that ``dialogue will be honored for the sake ofnational reconciliation.''   Namphy was arrested and escorted under guard to theinternational airport late Saturday, a government spokesman said.   The Dominican Republic said Namphy and Port-au-Prince MayorFranck Romain were granted political asylum in its embassy inPort-au-Prince. Romain was a colonel in the Presidential Guard andchief of police under the Duvaliers.   Namphy arrived in Santo Domingo about 8:30 a.m. Sunday on aplane that landed at the private Herrera Airport, according toFabio Herrera, deputy foreign minister in the Dominican Republic.Namphy was accompanied by his wife, Gabrielle, and his daughter,Melissa, Herrera said. The minister said he believed Romain wasstill at the embassy in Port-au-Prince.   The Haitian government reported Namphy's ouster several hoursafter shooting broke out at the main plaza in front of thepresidential palace. The gunshots sent dozens of people fleeing forcover.   Frantz Lubin, Haiti's director of information, told TheAssociated Press soldiers were slain during the coup, but nocasualties were mentioned by Avril.   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the fightinginvolved army factions and members of the Tonton Macoutes, thedreaded agents that terrorized Haitians during the 29-year-olddictatorships of the Duvalier family.   A French diplomat who also spoke on condition of anonymity andRadio Metropole said the shooting, including automatic gunfire,broke out around 5 p.m. Saturday on the Champ-de-Mars Plaza, infront of the Presidential Palace and near the army generalheadquarters and Dessalines Barracks.   Avril has been a key figure in Haiti's succession of governmentssince Duvalier fled to exile in France on Feb. 7, 1986.   He served as an adviser to a military-civilian junta headed byNamphy which succeeded Duvalier. Avril was forced to resign thatpost in early 1986 by anti-government demonstrations.   He participated in the June 17 coup led by Namphy that toppledthe four- month civilian government of President Leslie Manigat,who tried to transfer Avril from commander of the PresidentialGuard to an administrative post.   In his speech to members of the Presidential Guard at thenational palace, Avril declared himself president and promotedhimself to lieutenant general.   ``The Presidential Guard, sickened by the way the country hasbeen governed since the seventh of February, 1988...has been forcedto act again,'' he said.   Lubin said Dessalines Barracks Commander Jean-Claude Paul wasnamed the new commander-in-chief of the army, but Paul was notmentioned during Avril's address. After Namphy, Paul was consideredthe most powerful figure in the military regime. It was not clearwhat role, if any, Paul played in the coup.   Avril, a bespectacled, slim man of medium height, was dressed inuniform during his address. He was introduced as ``the most honestofficer in the armed forces'' by Sgt. Joseph Heubreux, who worefull battle gear.   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, Susan Clyde, said early Sunday thatthe new government made initial contacts with U.S. officials.   ``The stated intentions of this new government ... were tocorrect the abuses of the Namphy era, and to try to relaunch aperiod of change and progress for Haiti,'' she said. ``Andobviously we hope that the government will be able to carry outthese intentions.''   The coup came six days after about 20 thugs invaded the St. JeanBosco Roman Catholic church during a Mass being said by the Rev.Jean Bertrand Aristide, a critic of the military government.   The thugs, armed with guns, machetes and knifes, killed 13people and wounded 77 and then set fire to the church as soldierswatched from across the street. That night, five men and a womanboasted on government television they took part in the massacre. OnMonday thugs burned down another Catholic church.   Some people in the St. Jean Bosco church during the attack saidthey recognized several City Hall employees among the assailants.   Namphy's government said it ``regretted'' the killings. It hasmade similar statements after earlier killings but no arrests wereannounced.</TEXT></DOC>
