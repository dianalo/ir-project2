(floating pointoperations per second)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Alexander, Michael.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>University of Tennessee researchers have found a parallel computersystem built by Thinking Machines Corp to be the world's fastest.andO;The computer registered an incredible 5.2 billion FLOPS.andP;  The testconfirmed what advocates of parallel processing have said for along time: Nothing is better than a parallel computer for rawpower.andP;  Top computer scientists tend to agree.andP;  Officials ofThinking Machines Corp say that conventional supercomputers willbe obsolete by the mid-1990s.andP;  The vendor and a group of 15universities are working together on a parallel system that canexecute one trillion FLOPS.andP;  Completion is expected by 1993.andO;University computer scientists say that parallel computers are thewave of the future as designers are starting to bump up againstthe limits of single processor computers.andP;  Supercomputers handleproblems on a sequential basis.andP;  Massively parallel computerssplit up a problem among several processors.andP;  Parallel computerapplications are executed as much as 100 times faster than thoseon serial computers.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Thinking Machines Corp.
