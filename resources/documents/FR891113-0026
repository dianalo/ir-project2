BackgroundIn 1965, the Coast Guard recognized the need to develop guidance for planreview of merchant vessels having centralized control systems and automaticboilers. A series of Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circulars (NVICs)were issued to express policy and provide guidance for field inspectionoffices. These NVICs were used to ensure a general level of safety forautomatic auxiliary boilers at least equal to that required for manuallyoperated auxiliary boilers.Prior to 1968, only automatic steam boilers operating at pressures exceeding30 pounds per square inch and used for purposes other than propulsion werecovered by regulations under 46 CFR 162.026. In 1968, new marine engineeringrequirements were codified. These regulations were included in 46 CFR parts50 through 63. Specific industrial codes, standards, and specificationswere incorporated by reference for the design, construction, fabrication,operation, maintenance, and repair of boilers, pressure vessels, pressurepiping, and propelling and auxiliary machinery. Codes, standards, and specificationswhich are incorporated by reference have the same force and effect as otherU.S. Coast Guard regulations.For automatic auxiliary boilers, an industry standard was not availablethat the Coast Guard considered suitable for incorporation into the regulations.Portions of part 63 were derived from the experience the Coast Guard hadgained from implementing the NVICs and Part 162.026; however, most of part63 was developed to express new requirements.Since the publication of the marine engineering regulations in 1968, theAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has developed and publisheda standard, ``Controls and Safety Devices for Automatically Fired Boilers''which has been adopted by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).This standard has also been adopted into law by many federal and stateregulatory agencies. The Coast Guard has reviewed this document and concludedthat it contains many provisions which are suitable for incorporation intothe proposed regulations. These should be included along with design parameterswhich are unique to the marine environment. This regulatory project hasbeen initiated to accomplish these goals.b. Issues Addressed(1) <T3>Scope and applicability.</T3> The scope of part 63 should be clarified.Presently, automatic auxiliary boilers are divided into three broad categorieswhich are large automatic auxiliary boilers, small automatic auxiliaryboilers, and electric storage tank hot water supply boilers. It is notpresently clear from the language of Part 63 which types of boilers andheating equipment fall within the scope of the existing categories. Althoughnot stated in the present regulations, boilers should be classified bytheir service, control systems, pressure and temperature boundaries, heatinput ratings, and firing medium. The services of automatic auxiliary boilersare clearly defined. Those control systems and automatic boilers whichare governed by other parts and sections of the regulations are specified.Therefore, boilers governed by Part 63 should include large and small auxiliaryboilers, automatic heating boilers, automatic waste heat boilers, donkeyboilers, miniature boilers, electric boilers, electric hot water supplyboilers, auxiliary unit heaters, automatic incinerators, and fired thermalfluid heaters. However, only automatic auxiliary boilers having firingrates of less than 12,500,000 Btu/hr. will be covered by this proposedrule. Power boilers and auxiliary boilers having firing rates of 12,500,000Btu/hr. and above must meet the requirements of Part 52, and their controlsystems must meet the requirements of Part 62. New sections will be addedfor incinerators and exhaust gas boilers. The Coast Guard is expectinga large influx of incinerator approval requests due to the adoption ofthe International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships,1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (MARPOL 73/78 Annex V, GarbageDisposal Restrictions).<T3>(2) Safety.</T3> In accordance with section 63.05-25(b)(3) of the existingregulations, an auxiliary boiler's control system must ensure that thelength of the postpurge period is at least 15 seconds after the fuel valveis closed. The postpurge period should automatically occur when a boileris being secured; however, when an emergency trip occurs, the air flowto the boiler should not automatically increase. In 1983, an auxiliaryboiler explosion occurred on the SS PRESIDENT LINCOLN. A Coast Guard investigationdetermined that after repeated attempts to light off, during the automaticpostpurge cycle, an increase in air flow occurred creating an explosiveatmosphere. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard forthe Prevention of Furnace Explosions in Fuel Oil Fired Multiple BurnerBoiler Furnaces, NFPA 85D, Chapter 5-2.5.3, requires postpurge in suchcases to be under manual control. The proposed regulations will incorporatethis provision.<T3> (3) Adoption of Industry Consensus Standards.</T3> An industry consensusstandard, ``Controls and Safety Devices for Automatically-Fired Boilers'',ANSI/ASME CSD-1-1982/CSD-1a-1984, has been developed by an American Societyof Mechanical Engineers (ASME) committee composed of independent productcertification agencies, insurance companies, control system manufacturers,industry associations, and other regulatory agencies, and has been adoptedby ANSI. This standard covers automatic control system design, construction,installation, certification, and testing. It contains a self-certificationprocedure which is performed by the manufacturer, and it is currently usedby industry and other regulatory agencies. The Coast Guard proposes toadopt this industry standard and eliminate the burden of detailed planreview and component inspections. In the proposed rule, certification bythe manufacturer that the automatic auxiliary boiler and its control systemsmeet the requirements of part 63 will indicate compliance with the regulations. c. Discussion of Proposed Regulations<T3> Section 52.01-10 Automatic controls.</T3> Paragraph (b) is revisedand paragraph (c) is added to specify which particular parts of the regulationsapply to an auxiliary boiler based on its heat input ratings. Part 63 appliesto boilers having heat input ratings less than 12,500,000 Btu/hr. Thislimit is specified in ANSI/ASME CSD-1-1982/CSD-1a-1984 as the maximum cutoffpoint for which this standard applies. Controls and safety devices forboilers with fuel input ratings of 12,500,000 Btu/hr. or above fall withinthe scope of part 62.<T3> Section 52.01-135 Inspection and tests.</T3> Paragraph (d) is revisedto reflect that the requirements of the current andSection;andSection; 63.05-90and 63.10-90 are removed from part 63 and placed in part 61.<T3> Section 52.25-15 Fired Thermal Fluid Heaters.</T3> Paragraph (d) isadded to this section to cross-reference the test and inspection requirementsfound in subpart 61.30.<T3> Section 52.25-20 Exhaust Gas Boilers.</T3> This section is revisedto cross-reference the requirements for automatic exhaust gas boiler controlsystems found in andSection; 63.25-7 and subpart 61.35.<T3> Section 61.30-20 Automatic control and safety tests.</T3> In thissection, the requirement for the tests to be conducted in accordance withthe procedures in the heater instruction booklet has been removed. Also,the requirement to submit a test procedure for approval to the Officerin Charge, Marine Inspection has been removed. The new regulations do notrequire the submittal of instruction booklets for approval.<T3> Subpart 61.35_Design Verification and Periodic Testing for AutomaticAuxiliary Boilers.</T3> This subpart is added to cross-reference test andinspection requirements for automatic auxiliary boilers. The test and inspectionrequirements currently found in andSection;andSection; 63.05-90 and 63.10-90are moved to this subpart so that all test and inspection requirementsfor boilers, pressure vessels, fired thermal fluid heaters, machinery,and piping systems are located in one subpart. Test and inspection requirementsfor automatic auxiliary boilers are also revised to be consistent withthose for main power boilers without being overly burdensome.<T3> Part 63_Automatic Auxiliary Boilers.</T3> The Coast Guard proposesto revise the whole of part 63. A discussion of each subpart, as revised,follows.<T3> Subpart 63.01_General Provisions.</T3> This subpart is revised tostate the purpose, scope, and applicability (including exceptions) of part63. Automatic auxiliary boilers are classified by their service, controlsystems, pressure and temperature boundaries, heat input ratings, and firingmedium. The types of automatic auxiliary boilers covered by this part andthose control systems and automatic boilers which are governed by otherparts and sections of the regulations are specified. This proposed subpartdiffers from the existing regulations in that it establishes design criteriabased on a particular boiler's service, control systems, pressure and temperatureboundaries, heat input ratings, and the firing medium. This additionalinformation is provided for convenience, clarification, and ease of interpretationof the regulations.<T3> Subpart 63.05_Reference Specifications.</T3> This subpart is revisedby listing standards accepted by the Coast Guard as meeting the safetyrequirements for automatic auxiliary boiler controls and components. Sincethe lst revision to part 63, industry standards have been developed whichcover automatic boiler control system design, operation, and testing. Theprovisions in these standards provide an equivalent level of safety whencompared with the existing regulations. The standards listed in this subpartalready have been adopted by other state and federal regulatory agencies.<T3>Subpart 63.10_Miscellaneous Submittals.</T3> This subpart is revisedby eliminating the requirements to submit equipment descriptions, detailedplans, schematics, logic diagrams, bills of materials, and operating instructions.Plans will no longer be approved; however, the submittal of test procedureswill still be required. A requirement for the manufacturer to submit acertification report in accordance with ANSI/ASME CSD-1-1982/CSD-1a-1984has been added. This will allow the manufacturer to certify an automaticauxiliary boiler as complying with the provisions of this part and thereferenced industry consensus standards.<T3> Subpart 63.15_General Requirements.</T3> This subpart is revised byreferencing construction requirements for automatic auxiliary boilers,their accessories, and marine environmental design parameters which arerequired for safe operation. Tests and inspection requirements for automaticauxiliary boilers found in part 61 are cross-referenced.<T3> Subpart 63.20_Additional Control System Requirements.</T3> This subpartis added to consolidate the requirements for the programming control system,operating control system, flame safeguard control system, limit controlsystem, combustion control system, ignition system, water level controls,and low water cut off controls found in ANSI/ASME CSD-1-1982/CSD-1a-1984and the existing regulation. The unique marine requirements found in theexisting regulations have been retained. The procedure for purging afteran emergency trip has been added to reduce the possibility of furnace explosions.<T3> Subpart 63.25_Requirements for Specific Types of Automatic AuxiliaryBoilers.</T3> This subpart is added to specify requirements which are uniqueto small auxiliary boilers (firing rates of 3 gallons per hour (gph) orless), electric hot water supply boilers, fired thermal fluid heaters,exhaust gas boilers, and incinerators. The requirements in this subpartapply to the above listed boilers in addition to the requirements foundin other subparts which apply to all automatic auxiliary boilers. <T3>Reference Tables.</T3> Table 1 is provided for convenience when comparingthe proposed regulations with existing regulations.
