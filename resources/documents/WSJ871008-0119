So Casio Computer Co. has brought out the first unit pitched at women. Called &quot;Bebi,&quot; it has a face no bigger than a girl's palm, comes in pink and is shaped like a conventional television. It even has a stand. The advanced technology means it doesn't have to be shaped like a cube. &quot;It's just for design, for fashion,&quot; says Atsushi Okada, a Casio official.    Citizen Watch Co. has spotted another feminine feature for televisions. &quot;Women are asking for waterproof ones for the bath,&quot; says public-relations manager Yukoh Yamamoto Huko. &quot;I guess they tend to take long baths.&quot;    Tiny televisions, the pocket-sized offshoots of liquid-crystal display, or LCD, technology, are getting fancier all the time. The Japanese companies that are perfecting them have big plans, too: They envisage screens on the backs of seats on planes and on Japan's express trains, for example.    But first they have to create mass demand. That means appealing to people of all ages -- and both sexes. Indeed, manufacturers say they welcome competition on the ground that it will increase variety and raise the product's profile. That, in turn, will draw more consumer attention, they reason, and perhaps force TV networks to create more programming that would appeal to pocket-television viewers, such as all-day news or sports programs.    &quot;Basically, we want to see a lot of versions on the market to draw the customer's interest,&quot; says Kohtaro Inuyama, an official at Hattori Seiko Co., the first company to sell miniature LCD televisions with its TV-watch in 1982. &quot;Companies aren't fighting for market share because we're still at the stage of creating a new, big market for the product and technology.&quot;    The strategy seems to be working. Industry figures haven't been gathered, and company estimates of total domestic production and sales vary widely. But most companies agree that the market is growing about 40% annually, with sales of color units doubling each year.    So far, the digital-watch makers have dominated the market, but now more electronics companies are stepping in. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. began selling color-LCD miniature sets last autumn and has been the only consumer-electronics maker to have a color pocket television on the market. But Hitachi Ltd. and Sharp Corp. said late last month that they would sell competitive versions by the end of the year. Industry analysts say the entry of the electronics companies has quickened the pace of research into new and better screens, and changed market dynamics.    Some companies enjoyed brisk sales of black-and-white models in the U.S. until last year. But the soaring yen has deflated that market. In addition, U.S. anti-dumping tariffs on color televisions include LCD sets as well as conventional ones.    As a result, Japanese makers mostly are ignoring the overseas market until they can bring prices down. Meanwhile, they are pressing ahead on technology.    &quot;In 10 years, every car will have a virtual TV screen in the dashboard, a mobile data terminal,&quot; says David Keller, technology analyst at the Tokyo office of the securities company James Capel andamp; Co. Aircraft makers are intrigued by possible applications in control panels. In the U.S., the Pentagon has its eye on Japanese LCD developments for military aircraft. For home use, companies are working on huge televisions that can be mounted flat on the wall, and tiny monitors connected to small videotape players for private movie viewing.    The development of the tiny-television market has followed a pattern typical of Japanese industry. Companies set their sights on an advanced technology that has great commercial potential, such as LCD technology. On their way to achieving the lucrative reward of fully developing the technology, they bring out simpler consumer products, such as computer displays and digital watches, thereby stimulating public interest, establishing market share and generating cash to help offset development costs.    &quot;It's classic in the semiconductor business to make consumer products on the way,&quot; says Darrel Whitten, associate director of research in Tokyo for Prudential-Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd. &quot;This is one major reason why the revenue base for Japanese semiconductor makers is better than {for} their U.S. competitors.&quot;    The cost for development, Mr. Whitten adds, is &quot;the same there or here, but if you can only leverage it off on the industrial market, you're at a disadvantage compared to a company that can leverage it off against both industry and consumer electronics.&quot;    Japan's two-track approach means consumers have a wide choice. Yamagiwa, a Tokyo emporium of discount electronics, displays more than 25 varieties of tiny televisions. Some of the black-and-white versions are no thicker than a pencil and weigh only a pound or so. The picture isn't great, but at about 10,000 yen ($69.50), the price is right, salespeople say. More-advanced color versions with two-inch to three-inch screens show clear pictures, but they can cost more than five times the black-and-white versions.    A new product is released every few months, but usually it is a loss maker, industry analysts say.    &quot;We see this as a big potential market,&quot; says Hiroyasu Tatsumi, a manager in Matsushita Electric's television section. &quot;We think if we can increase output, we can make a go of it, but we can't say when it will be profitable. It's hard to say if it will be profitable as long as the only products are pocket TVs.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
