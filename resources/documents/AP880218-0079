The trillion-dollar budget Reagan sent to Capitol Hill todaywill require the Pentagon to thin ranks and scrap some weapons,like the Midgetman missile now under development and 16 frigatesalready at sea. The State Department may be forced to close someoverseas missions, but those have not been announced yet.   The budget calls for a $294 billion ceiling for militaryoutlays, up from 1988 outlays of $285.4 billion, but the increaseis less than half the estimated 4.3 percent inflation rise thisyear.   State Department spending is proposed to rise 2 percent above1988 levels, to $1.74 billion. But a weaker dollar and inflationabroad have raised the costs of diplomacy, meaning the governmentmay lay off personnel as some foreign outposts are shut.   ``The proposals for national security contained in this budgetrepresent an essential minimum program for keeping America safe andhonoring our commitments to our friends and allies,'' Reagan saidin a statement.   ``Anything less would jeopardize not only our national security_ and that of our friends and allies _ but also would dim theprospects for further negotiated agreements with our adversaries,''Reagan said.   The budget plans stand in sharp contrast to the military buildupof the first two years of the Reagan administration, when defensespending increased by 12 percent and 13 percent.   Reagan repeated his assertion that a mightier militarystrengthened his hand in diplomacy, as well.   ``Weapons systems have been modernized and upgraded. We arerecruiting and retaining higher caliber personnel. The readiness,training and morale of our troops have been improvedsignificantly'' since the beginning of the Reagan administration in1981, the president said.   ``Because we are stronger, enormous progress has been achievedin arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union,'' he said.   Austerity in the proposed budget for the fiscal year beginningnext Oct. 1 is forcing the Pentagon to plan on reducing the numberof men and women under arms by 34,000, to a force level of2,172,000, according to the budget. Reserve strength will remain at1.7 million.   The Air Force will bear the brunt of the personnel cuts, losing23,000 airmen, with the Army losing 8,600 soldiers; the Marines,2,900.   The Pentagon will drum out an additional 10,000 civilians from aworldwide staff of 1,102,000, according to the documents.   The cuts are expected to save $1.4 billion in personnel costs.More personnel savings could be realized if Congress torpedoes aplanned 4.3 percent pay increase.   America's nuclear muscle may sag some. Pentagon planners want tocancel development of the single-warhead mobile Midgetman missile.But many in Congress prefer deploying the Midgetman to devising away to move the MX missile by rail as a means of reducing Sovietability to hit it in a first strike.   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci is expected to ask for between$100 million and $200 million to keep the Midgetman just barelyalive. Air Force generals argue they can save more than $2 billionnext year and $39 billion in the future by canceling the Midgetman,according to administration officials, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The Pentagon also is expected to save $786 million by cancelingits anti-satellite missile program; Congress already has bannedtests of the device for three years.   The Navy's hopes for a 600-ship fleet may be pushed beyond thehorizon as that service readies mothballs for 10 frigates of theGarcia class and six frigates of the Brooke class built in theearly 1970s. Sailors from those ships will go to other vessels,saving the Navy from personnel cuts, except for the Marine Corps.   On the diplomatic front, the State Department may be headed backto the straits it faced last September, when a revenue shortfall of$60 million prompted Secretary of State George P. Shultz toforecast the elimination of 1,270 jobs and the closing of more thana dozen embassies and consulates abroad.   Congress gave the State Department an extra $60 million for thecurrent year.</TEXT></DOC>
