<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-32-1152 </DOCNO><TEXT>A prototype of a real-time radiation mapping system, Ranger, was developedto respond to an accident involving the release of plutonium for theDepartment of Energy's Accident Response Group. In 1987 Ranger demonstratedthat it can provide an efficient method of monitoring large areas ofland for radioactive contamination. With the experience gained from theoperation of the prototype, the external computer and software are beingupgraded in order to obtain a fully operational system. The new systemuses the prototype's commercially available line-of-sight microwave systemfor determining position and the same radiation detection instruments.The data obtained from the radiation detection instrument(s) are linkedback to the external computer along with the relative position of themeasurement through the ranging system. The data are displayed on a griddedmap as colored circles and permanently stored in real-time. The differentcolors represent different contamination levels. Contours can be drawnusing the permanently stored data. 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
