The money will now go to help existing programs survive.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  West Extra  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PARCEL TAX TO PROVIDE BASICS -- NOT EXTRAS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;We actually developed what we considered to be a minimum-essentialsbudget,&quot; said Superintendent Ken Simpkins. The parcel tax allowed the districtto avoid cutting to that level, which would have eliminated classroom aides,enrichment and remedial programs and, possibly, busing.;    The $150 perparcel tax was approved by voters in March and is expected to generate about$300,000 a year for five years. Although the first installment of that money,about $140,000, isn't expected until early next year, the board has alreadyworked the money into the budget. Loma Prieta's tentative budget for next yearis $2,652,000, about $16,000 less than this year.;    As planned, the districtwill use a portion of the money to buy new buses, with the first one expectedfor delivery in time for the new school year. The district has been usingschool buses that are more than 20 years old.;    Simpkins said the first79-passenger bus, which costs $106,000, is being bought with a $25,000 paymentdue in February with plans to pay it off over three years. In addition,$50,000 has been budgeted for a fund that will be used to buy a second bus thefollowing year.;    Other projects planned for parcel tax money will have towait, however. While programs like instrumental music and computer educationwill be maintained by the tax, they will not be expanded. And no one thoughtthe tax would have to help fund custodial and maintenance work as well aslibrary services.;    District parents were anxious to keep classes small andto avoid having to combine students of different grades in the same classroom,said Simpkins. To do that and deal with tight finances meant shifting how someprograms get funded, with the parcel tax picking up the slack. Simpkins saidit will probably be &quot;at least two years&quot; before tax money is used exclusivelyfor what it was intended.;    While parents have generally been supportive ofthe changes, Simpkins said, &quot;We all agree that its too bad we can't use itreally for its intended purpose.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ALETA PAYNE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910703  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  407  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 3, 199100185298,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
