Therefore at present only the upper limit ofthis risk can be estimated. Results of epidemiological studies amongstminers are associated with large uncertainties with regard to the assessmentof past radiation exposure, lung cancer diagnostic and/or classificationand synergistic effects due to smoking and dust exposure. An alternativeapproach uses dosimetric modelling for Rn-d inhalation to obtain Rn-dexposure-dose conversion factors. Large uncertainty is caused by individualvariability due the influence of life style, physical and biologicalparameters. It is concluded that for &quot;normal&quot; indoor Rn-d exposure theresulting risk is neglegible compared to other risks &quot;accepted&quot; by society.</TEXT></DOC>
