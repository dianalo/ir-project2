In addition, Soviet weapons likely would destroy a large part ofAmerica's armored force of tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehiclesduring the first stages of any war, retired Army Gen. Donn Starrytold a Senate Armed Services subcommittee.   Starry retired last year as commander of the Army's Training andDoctrine Command, where he specialized in armor systems.   Three years ago, a Pentagon Defense Science Board concluded notonly that the Soviet Union had the edge over the United States bothin armored protection and in defeating armored protection, but thatthe gap was growing worse.   ``The situation is now a matter of considerable nationalurgency,'' Starry said.   Army officials who testified along with Starry before the ArmedServices conventional forces subcommittee Wednesday agreed withhim, although their assessments were not as quite gloomy.   ``The Army agreed with the DSB conclusions in 1985 and stillagrees with the conclusion that we are behind the Soviets,'' saidLt. Gen. Donald S. Pihl, deputy to the assistant secretary of theArmy for research and development. ``We need to regain the lead andmaintain that advantage.''   The Soviet Union has about a 3-to-1 numerical advantage intanks, but U.S. officials have long contended that many of theSoviet tanks are far older than the modern tanks fielded in Europeby the United States and its NATO allies.   In addition, the United States and other NATO armies have tensof thousands of anti-tank missiles, such as the Dragon, severalvarieties of the TOW weapon, and the top-of-the-line Hellfiremissile carried by the Apache anti-tank helicopter.   Senators were surprised by Starry's assessment.   ``Are you including Hellfire?'' asked Sen. William Cohen,R-Maine.   ``Yes,'' Starry said.   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, asked,``are you saying that if we went to war, our bullets and missileswould bounce off Soviet tanks?''   ``That's correct,'' Starry said.   Starry said the Soviets are fielding a series of tank armorsmade of glass and ceramic composites. Atop those armor platings,the Soviets are putting a series of ``applique boxes,'' whichcontain specially designed explosives that blow up when the armoris hit by an incoming missile. The explosion on the applique boxdraws off the explosive energy of the incoming weapon and rendersit less powerful.   The applique boxes were first fielded by the Israelis about 10years ago, Starry noted, and were first used in combat duringIsrael's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.   ``The unhappy fact is that tanks with reactive armor on top ofbuilt-in glass composite or ceramic laminate armor will quitelikely defeat the warheads of all deployed'' weapons used byWestern forces, he said.   Starry also said the Soviets have more effective anti-tankweapons, meaning they likely would take a high toll among U.S.tanks during the early stages of any war.   Last month, Army officials unveiled a plan to improve the armoron the main U.S. battle, the M-1A1 Abrams, by using depleteduranium.   At the time, Army officials said in a statement that move was``a significant enhancement'' of U.S. armor capabilities and would``allow the Abrams to meet the anticipated threat well into the1990s.''   Asked about that assertion, Starry declined comment in opensession. But speaking later with reporters, he said, ``it's tooearly to tell how effective it will be.''   The Soviet advantage, combined with the new U.S.-Soviet treatythat will eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles from Europe,poses a grave danger, Starry said.   ``The Soviets obviously believe that they now have the means toexecute the operational concept they have embraced for so long _achieve quick, decisive victory at theater level of war, and do sowith such thoroughness and dispatch that the nuclear decision inthe West is yet in abeyance even as they consolidate their theaterlevel gains.''</TEXT></DOC>
