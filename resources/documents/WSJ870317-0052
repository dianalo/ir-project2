Whitehead at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport as he got off a flight from Athens Saturday, according to the office of Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau in New York City.    Mr. Whitehead, who will be 44 years old next week, is currently in a Rome jail awaiting extradition to the U.S.    Last September, Mr. Whitehead pleaded guilty to defrauding 70 clients of $4 million in an advance fee scheme he operated for two years. He would charge clients an advance fee of 1% to arrange financing for their business ventures. If unsuccessful, he would return the money, he assured his clients. He seldom did, officials said.    In one instance, Mr. Whitehead received $210,000 from Knoell Construction Co., of Phoenix, Ariz., to arrange a $21 million financing package. He also defrauded Midwestern Airlines Inc. of Milwaukee of $50,000 as part of a $5 million deal he said he would arrange. Midwestern is now defunct.    On Sept. 26, Mr. Whitehead pleaded guilty to one count of fraud and three counts of grand larceny but was released on a $100,000 bail to await sentencing this month. A day before the sentencing, he fled the country, and traveled across Canada, Hong Kong and Greece to Italy, the district attorney's office said.    Mr. Whitehead, who has a previous conviction for wire fraud, faces a maximum sentence of 10 to 20 years in state prison. </TEXT></DOC>
