The publication of this DON instructionwill assist members of the public in submitting such requests. It implementsDepartment of Defense Directive 5405.2 of July 23, 1985, codified in 32CFR part 97, regarding the release of official information in connectionwith litigation. It restates the requirements contained in Secretary ofthe Navy Instruction 5820.8 of August 11, 1987, and is intended to conformto that instruction in all respects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>December 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Commander R.F.

This regulation ensures that responses to litigationrequests are provided in a manner that does not prevent the accomplishmentof the mission of the command or activity affected. It sets forth the propercontent of a request received from a member of the public for release ofofficial DON information in connection with litigation and indicates thefactors to be considered in deciding whether to authorize the release ofofficial DON information or the testimony of DON concerning official information.(b) <T3>Impact of the regulation. </T3>The regulation is not a ``major rule''as defined by Executive Order 12291. Therefore, no regulatory impact analysishas been prepared. The DON certifies that this regulation will not havean impact on a significant number of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has beenprepared. The regulation has no collection of information requirementsand does not require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> This regulation is not subject to the relevant provisionsof the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347),and does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements under thecriteria of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511).(c) <T3>Request for comments.</T3> Because it merely imposed technical requirementsin which the public is not particularly interested or involved, this regulationappeared in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 22, 1989 (54 FR 26189), as an interimrule, effective on publication. No comments were received from the publicabout this regulation in the 30 day period designated for that purposein the interim rule ending on July 24, 1989. No substantive changes havebeen made to the regulation. In response to recommendations made by intra-agencypersonnel, however, andSection; 725.10 dealing with fees has been modifiedto clarify the guidance to Department of the Navy personnel contained therein.Additionally, several technical errors in titles, addresses, etc., havebeen corrected. Since these changes involve no new information, and becauseno comments were recieved from the public in response to the interim rule,no additional period for comment will be made available.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 725</ITAG>Courts, Government employees.For the reasons set out in the preamble, title 32, chapter VI, subchapterC, of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended by adopting as final andrevising part 725 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 725_RELEASE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION IN LITIGATION AND TESTIMONYBY DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY PERSONNEL AS WITNESSES</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">725.1 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">725.2 Policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">725.3 Authority to act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">725.4 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">725.5 Applicability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">725.6 Contents of a proper request or demand.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">725.7 Considerations in responding to a request.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">725.8 Responsibilities of DON personnel.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">725.9 Proper forwarding of a request.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">725.10 Fees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>5 U.S.C. 301, 10 U.S.C. 5013, 31 U.S.C. 9701, 32 CFRpart 97.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 725.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose.</ITAG>This instruction implements 32 CFR part 97 regarding the release of officialDepartment of the Navy (DON) information and provision of testimony byDON personnel for litigation purposes, and prescribes conduct of DON personnelin response to a litigation request or demand. It restates the informationcontained in Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5820.8 of August 11, 1987,and is intended to conform in all respects with the requirements of thatinstruction.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 725.2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy.</ITAG>(a) It is DON policy that official factual information, both testimonialand documentary, should be made reasonably available for use in federalcourts, state courts, foreign courts, and other governmental proceedingsunless that information is classified, privileged, or otherwise protectedfrom public disclosure.(b) DON personnel, as defined in andSection; 725.4(b), shall not providesuch official information, testimony, or documents, submit to interview,or permit a view or visit, however, without the authorization requiredby this instruction.(c) DON personnel shall not provide, with or without compensation, opinionor expert testimony concerning official DON or Department of Defense (DOD)information, subjects, personnel, or activities, except on behalf of theUnited States or a party represented by the Department of Justice, or withthe written special authorization required by this instruction.(d) Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section constitute a regulatory generalorder, applicable to all DON personnel individually, and need no furtherimplementation. A violation of those provisions is punishable under theUniform Code of Military Justice for military personnel and is the basisfor appropriate administrative procedures with respect to civilian employees.All DON personnel, military and civilian, present and former, are subjectto prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 201-207 for certain violations of this instruction.(e) Upon a showing by a requester of exceptional need or unique circumstances,and that the anticipated testimony will not be adverse to the interestsof the DON, DOD, or the United States, the General Counsel of the Navy,the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, or their respective delegates may,in their sole discretion, and pursuant to the guidance contained in thisinstruction, grant such written special authorization for DON personnelto appear and testify as expert or opinion witnesses at no expense to theUnited States.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 725.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Authority to act.</ITAG>(a) The General Counsel of the Navy, the Judge Advocate General of theNavy, and their respective delegates (hereafter ``determining authorities'')described in andSection;andSection; 725.8 and 725.9, shall respond to litigationrequests or demands for official DON information or testimony by DON personnelas witnesses.(b) If required by the scope of their respective delegations, determiningauthorities' responses may include: consultation and coordination withthe Department of Justice or the appropriate United States Attorney asrequired; referral of matters proprietary to another DOD component to thatcomponent; determination whether official information originated by theNavy may be released in litigation; and determination whether DOD personnelassigned to or affiliated with the Navy may be interviewed, contacted,or used as witnesses concerning official DOD information or as expert oropinion witnesses. Following coordination with the appropriate commander,responses may further include whether installations, facilities, ships,or aircraft may be visited or inspected; what, if any, conditions willbe imposed upon any release, interview, contact, testimony, visit, or inspection;what, if any, fees shall be charged or waived for access under the feeassessment considerations set forth in andSection; 725.10; and what, if any,claims of privilege, pursuant to this instruction, may be invoked beforeany tribunal.(c) The DOD General Counsel may notify DOD components that his or her officewill assume primary responsibility for coordinating all litigation requestsor demands for official DOD information or testimony of DOD personnel inlitigation involving terrorism, espionage, nuclear weapons, and intelligencesources or means. Accordingly, determining authorities who receive requestspertaining to such litigation shall notify the DON Associate General Counsel(Litigation) or the Deputy Assistants Judge Advocate General for InternationalLaw or General Litigation, who shall consult and coordinate with DOD GeneralCounsel prior to any response to such requests.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 725.4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Request or Demand (Legal Process). </T3>Subpoena, order, or other requestby a federal, state, or foreign court of competent jurisdiction, by anyadministrative agency thereof, or by any party or other person (subjectto the exceptions stated in andSection; 725.5) for production, disclosure,or release of official DOD information or for the appearance, deposition,or testimony of DON personnel as witnesses.(b) <T3>DON Personnel. </T3>Active duty and former military personnel of thenaval service including retirees; personnel of other DOD components servingwith a DON component; Naval Academy midshipmen; present and former civilianemployees of the DON including non-appropriated fund activity employees;non-U.S. nationals performing services overseas for the DON under provisionsof status of forces agreements; and other specific individuals or entitieshired through contractual agreements by or on behalf of DON, or performingservices under such agreements for DON (e.g., consultants, contractorsand their employees and personnel).(c) <T3>Litigation. </T3>All pretrial, trial, and post-trial stages of allexisting or reasonably anticipated judicial or administrative actions,hearings, investigations, or similar proceedings before civilian courts,commissions, boards (including the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals),or other tribunals, foreign and domestic. This term includes responsesto discovery requests, depositions, and other pretrial proceedings, aswell as responses to formal or informal requests by attorneys or othersin situations involving, or reasonably anticipated to involve, litigation.(d) <T3>Official Information. </T3>All information of any kind, however stored,in the custody and control of the DOD and its components (including theDON); or relating to information in the custody and control of DOD or itscomponents; or acquired by DOD personnel or its component personnel aspart of their official duties or because of their official status withinDOD or its components, while such personnel were employed by or on behalfof the DOD or on active duty with the United States Armed Forces. The determinationof whether ``official information'' (as opposed to non-DOD information),in whole or part, is sought, rests with the determining authority ratherthan the requester. The requester must still comply with the requirementsof andSection; 725.6 to support the contention that only non-DOD informationis at issue.(e) <T3>Factual and Expert or Opinion Testimony. </T3>DON policy favors disclosureof factual information if disclosure does not violate the criteria statedin andSection; 725.7 and is not classified, privileged, or otherwise subjectto withholding under statute, executive order, or regulation. The distinctionbetween factual matters, and expert or opinion matters (where DON policyfavors non-disclosure), is not always clear and involves the exercise ofdiscretion. The following considerations pertain:(1) DON personnel may merely be percipient witnesses to an incident, inwhich event their testimony would be purely factual. On the other hand,they may be involved with the matter only through an after-the-event investigation(e.g., investigation under the Manual of the Judge Advocate General), andasking them to identify conclusions in their report would likewise constitutefactual matters to which they might testify. In contrast, asking them toadopt or reaffirm their findings of fact, opinions, and recommendations,or asking them to form or express any other opinion, particularly one basedupon matters submitted by counsel or going to the ultimate issue of causationor liability, would clearly constitute precluded testimony under the foregoingpolicy.(2) DON personnel, by virtue of their training, often form opinions becausethey are required to do so in the course of their duties. If their opinionsare formed prior to, or contemporaneously with, the matter in issue, andare routinely required of them in the course of the proper performanceof their professional duties, they essentially constitute factual matters(i.e., the opinion they previously held). Opinions formed after the eventin question, however, generally constitute the sort of opinion or experttestimony which this instruction is intended to restrict severely.(3) Characterization of expected testimony by a requester as fact, opinion,or expert is not binding on the determining authority. When there is doubtas to whether or not expert or opinion (as opposed to factual) testimonyis being sought, advice may be obtained informally from, or the requestforwarded, to the Deputy Assistant Judge Advocate General (General Litigation)or the Associate General Counsel (Litigation) for resolution.(f) <T3>Determining Authority. </T3>The cognizant DON or DOD official designatedto grant or deny a litigation request. In all cases in which the UnitedStates is, or might reasonably become, a party, or in which expert testimonyis requested, the Judge Advocate General or the General Counsel of theNavy, depending on the subject matter of the request, will act as determiningauthority. In all other cases, the responsibility to act as determiningauthority has been delegated to certain commands and activities. Furtherguidance on the essential contents of a request and indicating where membersof the public should forward litigation requests is contained in andSection;andSection;725.8 and 725.9.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 725.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Applicable Situations. </T3>This instruction applies to the followingpersonnel and situations:(1) To all present and former civilian and military personnel of the DONwhether employed by, or assigned to, DON, temporarily or permanently. Categoriesof personnel affected are defined more fully in andSection; 725.4(b).(2) This instruction applies only to situations involving existing or reasonablyanticipated litigation, as defined in andSection; 725.4(c), when DOD or DONinformation or witnesses are sought, whether or not the United States,the DOD, or its components are parties thereto. It does not apply to formalor informal requests for information in other situations.(3) This instruction provides guidance for the operation of the DON andfor present and former DON personnel in responding to litigation requests.It is not intended, does not, and may not be relied upon, to create anyright or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equityagainst the United States, DOD, or DON.(4) This instruction is not intended to infringe upon or displace the responsibilitiescommitted to the Department of Justice in conducting litigation on behalfof the United States.(5) This instruction does not supersede or modify existing laws, DOD orDON regulations, directives, or instructions governing testimony of DONpersonnel or release of official DOD or DON information during grand juryproceedings.(6) This instruction does not control release of official information inresponse to requests unrelated to litigation or under the Freedom of InformationAct (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, or the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a. It does notpreclude treating any written request for DON records not in the natureof legal process as a request under the FOIA or Privacy Act. DON activitiesare encouraged to process requests for records under the FOIA or PrivacyAct if they are invoked by the requester either explicitly or by fair implicationas provided in 32 CFR 701.3(d) and 701.103(i).(b) <T3>Exceptions and Exclusions.</T3> This instruction does not apply torelease of official information or testimony by DON personnel in the followingsituations:(1) Before courts-martial convened by any DOD component, or in administrativeproceedings conducted by, or on behalf of, such a DOD component;(2) Under administrative proceedings conducted by, or on behalf of, theEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, the Merit Systems Protection Board,the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the Federal Services Impasse Panel,or under a negotiated grievance procedure under a collective bargainingagreement to which the Government is a party;(3) In response to requests by Federal Government counsel, or counsel representingthe interests of the Federal Government, in litigation conducted, in wholeor in part, on behalf of the United States (e.g., Medical Care RecoveryAct claims, affirmative claims, or subpoenas issued by, or concurred inby, Government counsel when the United States is a party);(4) As part of the assistance required by the Defense Industrial PersonnelSecurity Clearance Program Under DOD Directive 5220.6; \1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Copies may be obtained, if needed, from the U.S. NavalPublications and Forms Center, Attn: Code 301, 5801 Tabor Avenue, Philadelphia,PA 19120.(5) Release of copies of Manual of the Judge Advocate General (JAGMAN)investigations, to the next of kin (or their representatives) of deceasedor incompetent Naval personnel;(6) Release of information by DON personnel to counsel retained on theirbehalf for purposes of litigation, unless that information is classified,privileged, or otherwise protected from disclosure. (In the latter event,compliance with 32 CFR Part 97 and this instruction is required);(7) Cases involving garnishment orders for child support and/or alimony.The release of official information in these cases is governed by 5 CFRpart 581 and Secretary of the Navy Instruction 7200.16; \2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 725.5(b)(4).(8) Pursuant to release of information to federal, state, and local prosecutingand law enforcement authorities, in conjunction with an investigation conductedby a DOD component or DON criminal investigative organization;(9) This instruction does not preclude official comment on matters in litigationin appropriate cases.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 725.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contents of a proper request or demand</ITAG>(a) <T3>Written (i.e., routine) requests.</T3> If official information, throughtestimony or otherwise, is sought, a detailed request must be submittedin writing to the appropriate determining authority far enough in advanceto allow prompt and thorough evaluation of the request and avoidance ofadverse effects on the mission of the command or activity which must respond.A request that is deficient in providing necessary information may be returnedto the requester by the determining authority, with an explanation of thedeficiencies and a statement that no further action will be taken untilthey are corrected. If the circumstances so indicate, the determining authorityshould provide an information copy to the court issuing legal process aswell. Litigation requests must provide the information_as applicable tothe case under consideration_as follows:(1) A statement as to whether the United States is, or is reasonably anticipatedto become, a party to the matter;(2) The caption of the case, including names of the parties, docket number,court, and the date the action commenced;(3) Name, address, and telephone number of all counsel to the parties,or to other persons likely to become parties;(4) A brief summary of the facts of the case and the present posture ofthe case;(5) A description, in as much detail as possible, of the documents, information,or testimony sought;(6) A statement of whether factual, opinion, or expert testimony is sought;(7) If expert or opinion testimony is sought, an explanation of why exceptionalneed or unique circumstances exist justifying such testimony, includingwhy such testimony is not reasonably available from any other source;(8) A statement of the relevance of the matters sought to the proceedingsat issue;(9) The name, address, and telephone number of the person, from whom thedocuments, information, or testimony is sought (if applicable);(10) The date(s) on which the documents, information, or testimony soughtmust be produced; the requested location of production; and the estimatedlength of time that attendance of the DON personnel will be required (ifapplicable);(11) A statement of the requester's willingness to pay in advance, in accordancewith andSection; 725.10, all reasonable expenses and costs of searching forand producing documents, information, or personnel, including travel expensesand accommodations (if applicable);(12) A statement of understanding that the search and production will beat no expense to the Government;(13) In cases in which deposition testimony is sought, a statement of whetherlater deposition testimony or attendance at trial is anticipated and requested;(14) Agreement to notify the determining authority at least 10 days inadvance of all interviews, depositions, or testimony. Additional time fornotification may be required where the witness is located overseas;(15) Agreement to conduct the deposition at the location of the witness,unless the witness and his commanding officer or cognizant superior, asapplicable, stipulate otherwise;(16) In the case of former DON personnel, a brief description of the lengthand nature of their duties while in DON employment, and a statement ofwhether such duties involved, directly or indirectly, the information ormatters as to which the person will testify;(17) An agreement to provide free of charge to any witness a signed copyof any written statement he or she may make, or, in the case of an oraldeposition, a copy of that deposition transcript (if taken by a stenographer)or a video tape copy if taken solely by video tape, if not prohibited byapplicable rules of court;(18) An agreement that if the local rules of procedure controlling thelitigation so provide, the witness will be given an opportunity to read,sign, and correct the deposition at no cost to the witness or the Government;and (19) A statement of understanding that the United States reserves the rightto have a representative present at any interview or deposition. (b) <T3>Oral (i.e., emergency) requests. </T3>Written requests allowing reasonablelead time for evaluation and processing are normally required. However,in emergency situations where response time is severely limited and a writtenrequest is impractical, the following procedures should be followed:(1) The determining authority has discretion to waive the requirement ofa written request and expedite a response in the event of a bona fide emergencyunder conditions which could not be anticipated in the course of properpretrial planning and discovery. Oral (i.e., emergency requests) and subsequentdeterminations should be reserved for instances where factual matters aresought and insistence on compliance with the requirements of a proper writtenrequest would result in the effective denial of the request and cause aninjustice in the outcome of the litigation for which the information issought. No requester has a right to make an oral request and receive adetermination, however. Whether to permit such an exceptional procedureis a decision within the sole discretion of the determining authority,unless overruled by the General Counsel or the Judge Advocate General,as appropriate.(2) If the determining authority concludes that the request, or any portionof it, meets the foregoing criteria, the requester must agree to the applicableconditions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and andSection; 725.7(c).The determining authority will then orally advise the requester of theapproval and seek written confirmation of the oral request. The determiningauthority will make a written record of the disposition of the oral request,including the grant or denial, the circumstances requiring the procedure,and the conditions to which the requester agreed.(3) This emergency procedure should not be utilized where the requesterrefuses to agree to the appropriate conditions set forth in andSection;andSection;725.6(a) and 725.7(c) or indicates unwillingness to abide by the limitsof the oral grant, partial grant, or denial.(c) <T3>Visits and views.</T3> A request to visit a DON activity, ship, orunit, or to view materials or spaces located there, will be forwarded tothe appropriate determining authority for resolution. Action taken by thatauthority will be coordinated with the commanding officer of the activity,ship, or unit affected, or with his or her staff judge advocate (if applicable).The authority of the commanding officer of any activity, ship, or unitat issue, over the personnel or property of that activity, ship, or unitis not limited by this instruction. Visits and views involving DON unitsand activities in connection with litigation requests should not be accompaniedby interviews of personnel unless separately requested and granted. Themilitary mission of the unit shall normally take precedence over any visitor view. The commanding officer may independently prescribe reasonableconditions as to time, place, and circumstances to protect against compromiseof classified or privileged material, intrusion into restricted spaces,and unauthorized photography.(d) <T3>Requests for interviews.</T3> No witness may be required by legal processto submit to interview. DON personnel may voluntarily consent to be interviewedon official matters, with the permission of the appropriate determiningauthority. In deciding whether to agree to an interview, DON personnelshould be advised that if a request for an interview is refused, the requestermay seek to compel testimony at a deposition or at trial.(e) <T3>Requests for Privacy Act protected information.</T3> In addition tocomplying with the requirements of this instruction, litigation requestsfor official DON records contained in a ``system of records'' must satisfythe requirements for release imposed by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a.<T3>See </T3>32 CFR 701.100-701.120. Normally, this is accomplished byproducing:(1) The written consent of the subject of the record,(2) A court order or subpoena from a court of competent jurisdiction signedby a state or federal judge directing disclosure of the information, or(3) As indicated in 32 CFR 701.105, a demonstration of the applicabilityof some other Privacy Act exemption authorizing release of official DONrecords containing personal information to third parties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">When records contained in a ``system of records'' are released, disclosureaccounting requirements contained in 32 CFR 701.105(c) (Secretary of theNavy Instruction 5211.5C) \3\<NOTE/> must be complied with.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 725.5(b)(4).(f) <T3>Service of Process.</T3> 10 U.S.C. 7861 provides that the Secretaryof the Navy has custody and charge of all books, records, papers and propertyof the DON. Under 32 CFR 257.5(c), the Navy's sole delegate for serviceof process is the General Counsel of the Navy, whose address for this purposeis Office of the General Counsel, Department of the Navy, Washington, DC20350-1000. To be effective for judicial enforcement purposes, all legalprocess for official DON documents must be served upon the General Counsel,who will in most cases refer the matter to the proper delegate for action.Process for DON documents directly served on a subordinate officer withinany DON activity or command, not also properly served on the General Counsel,is insufficient to constitute an enforceable legal demand but shall beprocessed and acted upon by DON activities and determining authoritiesas a litigation request by counsel.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 725.7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Considerations in responding to a request.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General Considerations.</T3> In deciding whether to authorize releaseof official information and the testimony of DON personnel concerning officialinformation (hereafter referred to as ``the disclosure''), under a requestsatisfying the requirements of andSection; 725.6, the determining authorityshall consider the following factors:(1) The DON policy regarding disclosure set forth in andSection; 725.2 ofthis instruction;(2) Whether the request or demand is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriateunder applicable court rules;(3) Whether disclosure, including release <T3>in camera</T3> (i.e., to the judge or court alone), is appropriateunder procedural rules governing the case or matter in which the requestor demand arose;(4) Whether disclosure would violate or conflict with a statute, executiveorder, regulation, directive, instruction or notice. In this regard itis noted that this instruction is not intended to place unreasonable restraintsupon the post-employment conduct of former military members and civilianemployees of DON. Accordingly, requests for expert or opinion testimonyby such personnel will normally be granted unless that testimony wouldconstitute a violation of statute (e.g., 18 U.S.C. 201 et. seq.), regulation(e.g., DOD Directive 5500.7 \4\<NOTE/> and Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5370.2H \5\<NOTE/> (Standards of Conduct)), or disclose properly classifiedor privileged information;<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 725.5(b)(4).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 725.5(b)(4).(5) Whether disclosure, in the absence of a court order or written consentwould violate the Privacy Act, as explained previously in andSection; 725.6(e);(6) Whether disclosure, including release <T3>in camera,</T3> is appropriate or necessary under relevant substantivelaw concerning privilege (e.g., attorney-client, attorney work-product,deliberative process, or, in the case of civilian personnel, physician-patient);(7) Whether disclosure, except when <T3>in camera</T3> and necessary to assert a claim of privilege, wouldreveal information properly classified pursuant to DOD Directive 5200.1-R\6\<NOTE/> (Information Security Program Regulation), unclassified technicaldata withheld from public release pursuant to DOD Directive 5230.25,\7\<NOTE/> privileged Naval Aviation Safety Program information (suchas mishap investigation report witness statements), matters exempt fromdisclosure under the Privacy Act, or other matters exempt from unrestricteddisclosure.
