The state ADN news agency also said Soviet Politburo hard-linerYegor Ligachev and East German government officials had issued ajoint statement harshly criticizing West Germany.   The developments came amid indications East Berlin had begunclamping down on trips to Hungary.   ``The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) expects theimmediate rescinding'' of Hungary's decision to ``unilaterallysuspend'' parts of bilateral agreements on border controls, said alengthy report by ADN.   ``The Hungarian side is responsible for the current situation,''said the report.   According to ADN, the protest note was handed over to theHungarian Foreign Ministry in Budapest.   More than 10,000 East Germans who were vacationing in Hungaryhave fled to the West since early Monday.   East German newspapers devoted large amounts of space to theexodus and portrayed it as an unjustified act caused by West Germanywith the assistance of Hungary.   Neues Deutschland, the Communist Party's official newspaper, rana report from a refugee camp at Passau, West Germany. It called theexodus a ``provocation organized at high levels,'' and an ``illegalaction to lure away East German citizens in Hungary.''   The Communist Party youth newspaper Junge Welt called the exodusan ``anti-socialist action ... by Bonn.''   Sources told The Associated Press that police offices responsiblefor processing applications for tourist visas are filled nearlyevery day with East Germans eager to go to Hungary, ostensibly forvacation. But many more are seeing those requests turned down, theysaid.   No official figures are available on the number of East Germanswaiting for a judgment on their visa applications.   Some unofficial estimates put the number of East Germans whodesire to emigrate to the West at 1 million.   News of the exodus of East Germans to the West provoked bittercynicism among some who remained in their Communist homeland.   ``The officials are soon going to introduce a new holiday justfor us who stayed _ The Day of Those Left Behind,'' said an EastBerlin construction worker, who would not give his name.   The East Germans arriving in the West say they left theirhomeland because of repression and frustration over the government'srefusal to adopt political reforms.   A new opposition political group has been founded in East Germanyto try to pressure the Communist government to make democraticreforms.   According to Lutheran Church sources, the ``New Forum'' wasfounded by 100 East Germans, including former Communist Partymembers, scientists, workers and students from across the country.   In an announcement of its founding, the group said it is tired ofa country ``filled with henchmen, informers and do-nothingloudmouths.''   Some Communist Party functionaries have complained they feel liketheir country is like ``a ship without a captain'' with East Germanleader Erich Honecker slowly recovering from gall bladder surgery.   Western news reports have said Honecker may be dying, butgovernment sources deny that.</TEXT></DOC>
