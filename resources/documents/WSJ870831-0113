After 75 years of doing without, however, we now have an extremely useful handbook to understanding that most Delphic of oracles: Pravda, the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. With its 18 million readers, this most authoritative medium in the state-controlled Soviet press is arguably the most important paper in the world.    Pravda, Angus Roxburgh points out in &quot;Pravda: Inside the Soviet News Machine&quot; (Braziller, 285 pages, $19.95), is not a newspaper by Western standards. To understand the difference, it is important to first examine what the reader will not find in its scant six pages (eight on Mondays).    The so-called &quot;Index of Information Not to Be Published in the Open Press&quot; contains a long list of subjects that can never appear in print in the Soviet Union. No copy of the index has yet reached the West, but it is known to include such items as details of the censorship system itself; overall crime statistics; locations of labor camps and prisons; civil unrest and strikes; figures for Soviet military and economic aid to foreign countries, and a long list of other &quot;unmentionables.&quot;    Although it is extremely unlikely that any such information ever creeps into Pravda's proofs in the first place, the paper is in fact censored twice: once before printing and once before distribution. A censorship number appears at the foot of the back page of every edition, in the form of the letter B plus a five-digit number. Mr. Roxburgh's study of these numbers shows that Pravda currently has three censors, who work on a three-week rotation. Their job extends beyond expurgating the facts on the index, to eliminating ideological &quot;errors&quot; and even to guarding against unfortunate juxtapositions of headlines or articles.    Mr. Roxburgh is a journalist himself, who serves as a reporter on Soviet affairs for the London Guardian. He has a particular facility for comparing Pravda's rigid format with the kinds of newspaper layouts to which Western readers are accustomed. Don't be surprised, he cautions, not to see &quot;front-page news&quot; on the front page of Pravda. Instead, world current events always appear -- if at all -- two-thirds of the way into the paper, on pages four and five.    Page one is reserved for the party's most workaday announcements: the names and titles of party leaders, proceedings of party plenums and the Supreme Soviet, and official speeches -- all of which are set forth in painstakingly superficial detail. Picture-profiles of model workers appear regularly, as do tidbits of economic and foreign stories (never the most important items, however). The careful Pravda reader, therefore, must watch for deviations from the norm. Mr. Roxburgh makes this easy. For example, his seven-part standard format for a typical front-page leader is as elegantly simple as the protocol for a sonnet: 1. Subject is named. 2. Quotation from incumbent leader. 3. Praise for towns or republics that are doing well. 4. Paragraph beginning &quot;However . . .&quot; mentions places that are falling behind. 5. Reminder of consequences of falling behind. 6. Remedies for laggards. 7. Primary role of party is mentioned.    Most useful of all, perhaps, is Mr. Roxburgh's history of Pravda, sprinkled liberally with anecdotes, which helps distinguish the mere wave motion that so often captivates the Western media from the rare sea changes that deserve our most careful attention.    Indeed, many of what pass for insightful discoveries of new developments in Soviet journalism are in fact merely sightings of red herrings that have surfaced many times before. For example, current rumors that Pravda may soon begin to include advertising for state enterprises have prompted some Western analysts to forecast a free-enterprise renaissance, akin to that permitted under Lenin's New Economic Policy of the '20s. Readers of Mr. Roxburgh's guide, however, will know better. &quot;Buy Cornflakes {Kornfleks} -- nutritious and tasty!&quot; was one of several familiar advertising refrains carried in Stalin's Pravda of the '30s. At the height of the purges, in fact, the paper's movie ads were illustrated with drawings of women in silky gowns, decadent even by today's standards. Such things come and go. But the basic Soviet concepts of propaganda and news, and the structure of the propaganda apparatus, remain the same.    Mr. Roxburgh's guide also contains sections on how Pravda is planned and produced, its readership, and its reception and effect within the Soviet Union. It includes, as well, an extra bonus: selected articles from the paper since 1981, translated into English by the author and his wife.    From Trotsky to Molotov to Stalin, from Sverdlov to Bukharin, and from Suslov to Zimyanen and now Afanasyev, Pravda has provided a tangled web of truths, half-truths and omissions that holds cryptic clues to official Soviet thinking. Mr. Roxburgh's book is indispensable to anyone who seeks to interpret it.    ---   Mr. Cox is a founder of Associated Publishers Inc., independent publishers of the English-language translation of Pravda. </TEXT></DOC>
