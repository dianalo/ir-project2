Graphic charts, systemsketches, diagrams, tables, elements systems (basic solar architecture),different types of systems (direct thermal gains, thermal storage) andplanning criteria for elements and systems which belong to solar engineeringare given. Attention is also given to heat zones, delayed supply of theheat gained by solar systems to the air in a room, form and orientationof buildings, size of windows, thermal insulation, protection againstsummer heat, mobile sun shades, passive utilization of solar energy variousconstruction methods, solar engineering systems, irradiation and shading.(HWJ)</TEXT></DOC>
