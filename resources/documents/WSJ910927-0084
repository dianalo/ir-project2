Senators voted 67-33 to eliminate $225 million that theBush administration had requested for a rail system totransport the nuclear missile. The 50 long-range weaponsalready stored in underground silos weren't affected byyesterday's vote; the deleted funds were intended to buildone train car to test whether a rail system would bepractical for deploying and firing the MX.</LP><TEXT>   The Senate's lopsided vote against the rail systemcontrasts with the 49-48 margin by which a similar anti-railamendment was killed just seven weeks ago. The reversal wasfurther evidence that congressional support for some majorweapons programs is eroding in the wake of the disintegrationof Soviet communism, while lawmakers' concern over the redink at home is building.   &quot;What's happened since August in the Soviet Union hasconvinced substantial numbers of senators that there is noneed to waste any more money on this rail program,&quot; said Sen.James Exon of Nebraska, a Democrat who had offered theunsuccessful MX amendment in August.   Because the House bill includes the rail funds, the issuewill have to resolved in later negotiations.   The MX amendment yesterday was the last of three proposalsto cut the defense budget from Senate Budget CommitteeChairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.), who argued that Congresscouldn't stay within budget limits in coming years unlesssome big-ticket defense and domestic projects were killed.   His other two proposals were narrowly rejected Wednesday,in votes with thinner margins than on similar proposals justlast month. An amendment to stop purchases of the B-2 stealthbomber was rejected 51-48, and one to cut funding for theanti-missile Strategic Defense Initiative from $4.6 billionto $3.5 billion was defeated 50-49.   In contrast, the Senate voted 90-10 during yesterday'saction against Sen. John McCain's proposal to delete $1.8billion for the Seawolf attack submarine. But thatoverwhelming show of support for the Seawolf belied itsnear-defeat days earlier.   The defense appropriations subcommittee didn't fund thesubmarine program when it drafted the Pentagon spending billlast week. But a day later, subcommittee Chairman DanielInouye (D., Hawaii) got the full Appropriations Committee torestore funding after what he described as intense lobbyingby New England senators, Navy officials and General DynamicsCorp.'s Electric Boat division, which would build the Seawolfin Connecticut.   Sen. McCain, an Arizona Republican, objected that a singleSeawolf would consume one-quarter of the Navy's shipbuildingbudget.   Picking up the argument more often made by Democrats, healso contended that events had rendered the submarineunnecessary. &quot;The world has changed in the last coupleyears,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no longer a threat of a war withthe Soviet Union.&quot;   After the vote, Sen. McCain predicted, &quot;It'll be the lastone they build.&quot;   The overall bill was approved last night on a voice vote.Other provisions would:   -- Set active-duty forces at 1,886,400, just 300 below theadministration's recommendation and 106,358 below currentlevels.   -- Reduce the National Guard and Reserve, a favorite ofimportant lawmakers, by 35,166, far less than the reductionof 107,526 that the administration sought.   -- Provide $4.1 billion, as the administration sought, forfive Burke-class destroyers with the Aegis anti-aircraftsystem; $225 million to upgrade the M-1 Abrams tank withlarger cannons, and $1.2 billion, more than theadministration requested, for 49 Trident II missiles.   -- Include $1 billion for 24 F-117 stealth fighters, whichlawmakers lauded for its role in the Gulf War.   -- Permit servicewomen and spouses of servicemen to haveabortions at overseas installations. The president hasthreatened to veto a bill with the abortion provision. TheHouse bill has no such provision.   In other action on appropriations for fiscal 1992, whichbegins Oct. 1, House and Senate negotiators approved theadministration's full $2 billion request for development andconstruction of the space station, which carries a price tagprojected to be as high as $40 billion ultimately. Thedecision came as they completed work on an $80.9 billionmeasure covering an eclectic mix of veterans, housing andspace programs.   The compromise spending measure still faces votes in bothchambers before it goes to Mr. Bush, but the bargainers'action all but guarantees funding for the space station inthe next year.</TEXT></DOC>
