Siegel and Ivan F. Boesky for more than $300 million in actual damages, charging that insider trading between Messrs. Siegel and Boesky forced its predecessor company to pay too much for Natomas Co. in 1983.    In a suit filed in state court in Dallas, Maxus said Kidder Peabody and Mr. Siegel acted as financial advisers in the transaction, in which Diamond Shamrock Corp. ultimately acquired San Francisco-based Natomas in a stock swap valued at $1.27 billion. Prior to the purchase, however, the stock price of Natomas shot up to about $19 a share from $14, leading Diamond Shamrock to make an initial tender offer for Natomas at a price about $5 a share, or about $300 million, higher than necessary, the suit charges.    The Natomas purchase, whose assets consisted primarily of Indonesian oil and gas properties, has been widely regarded as one of the worst acquisitions in the oil and gas industry in recent years. Oil and gas prices plummeted shortly after the transaction, and Diamond Shamrock wrote down $600 million of the purchase price in 1985.    Maxus, which assumed Diamond's oil and gas exploration business after Diamond Shamrock was split in two earlier this year, has since written down $335 million more of Natomas assets.    Kidder Peabody, a unit of Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric Co., filed a complaint in federal court in New York, seeking a declaratory judgment that the firm has no liability to Maxus arising out of the Natomas acquisition.    The complaint said Kidder was, &quot;properly perceived, a victim of the alleged (insider trading) scheme.&quot; And it added, if Kidder Peabody is held to be liable, the firm seeks a finding that &quot;it is entitled to indemnification and contribution&quot; from Messrs. Siegel, Boesky and certain Boesky related entities for any such judgment.    A lawyer for Mr. Siegel said he couldn't comment because he hadn't yet seen the Maxus complaint, nor had his client been served.    Robert McCaw, a lawyer for Mr. Boesky, said he couldn't comment because he hadn't yet seen the suit, but said &quot;we'll defend (the suit) as appropriate.&quot;    Mr. Boesky, a key figure in a major insider-trading scandal, has been ordered to repay illegal profits of $50 million and fined $50 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement. He pleaded guilty to a single felony-conspiracy count and awaits sentencing.    The Securities and Exchange Commission levied $25.3 million in penalties and imposed stringent controls on Kidder Peabody in June in return for settling allegations of civil insider trading and other securities law violations.    Mr. Siegel, a former investment banker at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Kidder Peabody, channeled inside information on takeovers to Mr. Boesky; he pleaded guilty to two federal charges of income-tax evasion and securities-law violations. He was barred from the securities industry and agreed to pay a $9 million civil fine. He also awaits sentencing.    In the latest of what may be several similar lawsuits related to insider trading, Maxus charges that Mr. Boesky, acting on inside information from Mr. Siegel and Kidder, bought more than $12 million of Natomas's stock while Diamond Shamrock was planning its purchase. He then sold that stock for a $4.8 million profit after Diamond Shamrock said it wanted to acquire Natomas, the suit says.    Maxus said Diamond Shamrock wouldn't have proceeded with the acquisition and would have avoided its large losses over the years if it had known of Messrs. Boesky and Siegel's &quot;unlawful conduct.&quot;    In addition to damages from paying a higher-than-necessary price for Natomas, Maxus also is asking to recover more than $4 million in fees and expenses it paid to Kidder for the transaction. The company says Kidder Peabody is responsible for at least some of its damages because it put Mr. Siegel into a key role and encouraged Diamond Shamrock to make him one of its most trusted advisers.    In its suit, Maxus charges that Kidder Peabody breached its contract with Diamond Shamrock, that it and Mr. Siegel breached their fiduciary duty to the company and that Kidder, Mr. Siegel and Mr. Boesky defrauded the company.    Apparently out of concern about how the Texas courts have handled the Texaco-Pennzoil lawsuit, Kidder Peabody filed its lawsuit in New York federal court and in Delaware state court. Kidder Peabody said it filed its complaint in New York, and that the issue should be resolved there, because most of the relevant events in the case took place there.    However, a Maxus spokesman says most of the events described in its suit took place in Texas and said the company is &quot;perfectly confident&quot; that Texas courts should have jurisdiction over the lawsuit.    To date, only Unocal Corp. has filed a similar civil suit, seeking damages related to insider trading. In April, the Los Angeles energy concern filed a $2.5 billion lawsuit against Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Kidder Peabody and four individuals including Mr. Siegel. However, the lawsuit was put on hold in late May after the government dropped criminal charges against some of the defendents. A Unocal spokesman said yesterday that the suit hasn't progressed any further. </TEXT></DOC>
