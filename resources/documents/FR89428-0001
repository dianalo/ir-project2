This program is authorized by Pub. L. 100-566,the ``Federal Employees Leave Sharing Act of 1988,'' which requires OPMto establish leave bank programs in at least three Executive agencies byJuly 31, 1989.In addition, OPM is amending the interim regulations governing the 5-yearvoluntary leave transfer program established under Pub. L. 100-566. Thechanges are primarily technical in nature and will serve to facilitateimplementation of the program.

L. 100-566, the ``Federal EmployeesLeave Sharing Act of 1988,'' directs the Office of Personnel Management(OPM) to establish by regulation a 5-year experimental program under whichthe unused accrued annual leave of employees in approved Executive agenciesmay be contributed to leave banks for withdrawal and use by leave bankmembers who need such leave because of a medical emergency. This authoritywill terminate on October 31, 1993. In Executive agencies or their administrativesubunits whose participation is approved by OPM, the program establishedby these regulations will replace the voluntary leave transfer programalso established under Pub. L. 100-566.Many statutory provisions of the voluntary leave bank program are identicalto provisions of the voluntary leave transfer program. Therefore, thisinterim rule incorporates many provisions of the interim rule for the voluntaryleave transfer program published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 31, 1989.<T3>Affected Agencies</T3>. In a separate <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, OPM will announce the specific Executiveagencies or administrative subunits of Executive agencies approved to participatein the voluntary leave bank program. Although OPM will approve each agency'sparticipation, it will not formally review or approve the agencies' policiesor procedures.<T3>Objectives</T3>. OPM's primary objectives in developing the interimrule were to (1) provide each agency with the flexibility to tailor itsvoluntary leave bank program to meet its particular needs and circumstances;(2) enable each leave bank board to maintain an adequate supply of annualleave in the leave bank to meet the needs of potential leave recipientsto the greatest extent practicable; and (3) ensure that adequate informationis available to permit OPM to evaluate the voluntary leave bank experiment.The key features of the interim rule are:<T3>Enrollment periods</T3>. The law directs OPM to establish by regulationan open enrollment period during which an employee may make applicationto contribute annual leave to the leave bank. An employee may become aleave bank member by contributing, during an open enrollment period establishedby the leave bank board, at least the minimum contribution of annual leaveestablished by the board. To ensure equitable treatment of employees who(1) move into an organization operating a leave bank or (2) return fromextended absences outside the open enrollment period, the interim rulealso authorizes leave bank boards to establish individual enrollment periodsfor such employees.Because of the varying characteristics of the agencies experimenting withthe voluntary leave bank program and because this is the first leave bankexperiment conducted in the Federal sector, OPM considers it impracticalto prescribe by regulation the exact number, timing, or length of enrollmentperiods. The interim rule requires that an open enrollment period lastat least 30 calendar days to ensure that employees have an adequate opportunityto contribute annual leave and to minimize the need to establish individualenrollment periods for new employees or employees absent from duty duringopen enrollment periods. Agencies may determine the number and schedulingof enrollment periods. (See andSection; 630.1004 paragraphs (c) through (f).)<T3>Additional contributions of annual leave. </T3>To help the leave bankboard maintain an adequate supply of annual leave in the leave bank, theinterim rule permits an employee to contribute annual leave at any timeduring the leave year. Agencies are encouraged to take advantage of thisprovision by appealing for additional voluntary contributions when additionalannual leave is needed. Contributions outside the established enrollmentperiods will not, however, entitle an employee to become a leave bank member.(See andSection; 630.1004(k).)<T3>Time limits for filing application. </T3>The interim rule authorizesleave bank boards to establish rules governing the timeliness of an applicationto become a leave recipient. (See andSection; 630.1006(b).)<T3>Response time for applications to become a leave recipient. </T3>Theinterim rule requires the agency to set a time limit on the leave bankboard's action on an application to become a leave recipient. (See andSection;630.1007(e).)<T3>Limitations on withdrawal of annual leave from a leave bank. </T3>Theinterim rule authorizes leave bank boards to set limits on the amount ofannual leave that may be withdrawn from the leave bank by a single leaverecipient. OPM's review of experience in public sector leave bank programsindicates that such limitations may help agencies ensure that each leavebank maintains an adequate supply of annual leave. Leave bank boards maywish to consider establishing limitations such as (1) a limit on the totalamount of annual leave that may be withdrawn from the leave bank by a singleleave recipient, (2) a limit on the amount of annual leave a single leaverecipient may withdraw during a given time period, or (3) a limit on theamount of annual leave that may be <T3>available </T3>to a single leave recipient at any one time. (See andSection;630.1007(f).)<T3>Rules of employee movement. </T3>The interim rule prescribes generalpolicies governing employee movement into and out of an organization operatinga leave bank. For ease of administration, a leave recipient's medical emergencywill be considered to have terminated on the date the employee moves. Therefore,unused annual leave withdrawn from a leave bank will be returned to theleave bank when a leave recipient moves out of the organization operatingthe leave bank. The employee may then (1) apply to become a leave bankmember in his or her new organization (if applicable) by making the minimumcontribution with accrued annual leave, and (2) apply to become a leaverecipient under the voluntary leave bank program or voluntary leave transferprogram, as applicable. (See andSection;andSection; 630.1014 and 630.1015.)<T3>Technical changes in Voluntary Leave Transfer Program. </T3>Publicationof the interim rule for the voluntary leave bank program has required severaltechnical changes in the interim rule for the voluntary leave transferprogram published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 31, 1989. In addition, the amendedrule clarifies the requirement to establish a separate leave account forleave accrued while an employee is in a transferred leave status.Finally, the new law and interim rule require approved agencies to implementthe voluntary leave bank program by July 31, 1989. Until an agency implementsits voluntary leave bank program, the voluntary leave transfer programauthorized by Pub. L. 100-566 remains in effect.Pursuant to sections 553(b)(3)(B) and 553(d)(3) of title 5, United StatesCode, I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposedrulemaking and for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.The notice and the 30-day delay in the effective date are being waivedbecause of the need to facilitate the implementation of the voluntary leavebank program by participating Federal agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that these regulations will not have a significnt economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because they will affect onlyFederal employees and Executive agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 630</ITAG>Government employees.<ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is amending Part 630 of Title 5 of the Code of FederalRegulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 630_ABSENCE AND LEAVE</ITAG>1.
