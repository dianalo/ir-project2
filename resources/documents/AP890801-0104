(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Relatives of hostage Joseph JamesCicippio today waited two hours after the deadline for hisexecution had passed before learning his pro-Iranian captors hadgiven him a 48-hour reprieve.   ``It's good news for all of us,'' said Thomas Cicippio as hestood on the front lawn of his house, flanked by two of hisbrother's sons, Joseph Jr. and David. He then went inside to talkto other family members.   The Revolutionary Justice Organization said Monday it would killCicippio if Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Moslem cleric seized byIsraeli commandos, was not released by 11 a.m. EDT. The groupannounced the reprieve at 1:15 p.m. EDT.   In between, family members anxiously awaited word of Cicippio'sfate.   ``Now it becomes a waiting game,'' Thomas Cicippio said sevenminutes after the 11 a.m. deadline.   Earlier today, Thomas Cicippio asked that Israel free Obeid andthat the United States and its allies refrain from military action,while his sister-in-law, in Beirut, publicly asked the captors ofher 58-year-old husband to spare his life.   Thomas Cicippio, standing on the front lawn of his house wheresigns count the number of days his brother and other Americans havebeen held hostage in Lebanon, asked of Israel: ``Please releaseSheik Obeid as quickly as possible. We must try to do everything wepossibly can to start peace movement once again.''   ``Please don't execute him, please,'' Joseph Cicippio's wife,Ilham, who works at the American Embassy in east Beirut, tearfullypleaded today in Beirut.   She read a message to her husband: ``Joe, I know the difficultyof the situation in which we are, but all I ask you is to keep yourhopes high.''   Obeid is a spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, orParty of God, believed to be an umbrella group for kidnappersholding Higgins and the 16 other Westerners missing in Lebanon.Eight of the 16 are Americans.   Cicippio was acting comptroller at the American University ofBeirut when he was kidnapped from the campus Sept. 12, 1986.   ``The organization announces its quick resolve to execute thedeath sentence against the American-Israeli spy Joseph Cicippio ifthe struggling sheik is not released,'' his captors said in astatement, adding the execution would be ``broadcast on all screensin the world.''   The statement, handwritten in Arabic, was delivered to theindependent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar with a photograph of Cicippio.   Thomas Cicippio said that before the latest developments, he wasbecoming more hopeful.   ``We've been watching the elections in Iran and I put a lot ofhope in (Iran's Parliamentary Speaker Hashemi) Rafsanjani helpingthe U.S. gain release of the hostages.''   Rafsanjani, considered a pragmatist among Iran's religioushierarchy, was elected president of Iran by a landslide majoritySaturday.</TEXT></DOC>
