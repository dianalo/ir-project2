His resignation, announced at a news conference thismorning, follows a flurry of reports alleging widespreadmisconduct in the nation's securities industry despitecleanup efforts by the government. In many ways, theresignation is a continuation of the turmoil that sweptJapan's financial markets last year, driving the stock marketdown nearly 50% at its low last year and taking the profitsand reputation of the securities industry down with it.</LP><TEXT>   Earlier this month, Japanese newspapers reported thataffiliates of Nomura, the world's largest securities company,and Nikko Securities Co., another of Japan's so-called BigFour securities companies, had financed a company thatJapanese police say is a front for one of the country'sbiggest underworld syndicates, the Inagawakai. The securitiesfirms admit doing the business, but say they were unaware ofany links to organized crime.   Then a fresh scandal hit. Late last week, Nomura and Nikkoadmitted paying a total of more than 33 billion yen ($237.6million) to compensate certain big clients for money theylost when Japan's financial markets crashed last year.   On Sunday, Japan's leading financial daily, the NihonKeizai Shimbun, reported that the two other major Japanesesecurities houses -- Daiwa Securities Co. and YamaichiSecurities Co. -- also paid more than 10 billion yen toclients for losses in early 1990. Last year, the two wereamong 20 firms disciplined by the Finance Ministry forpayments totaling 16 billion yen to big clients for losses inthe 1987 &quot;Black Monday&quot; crash.   The resignation of Nomura's Mr. Tabuchi, 59 years old, hassignificantly expanded the proportions of the scandal. As thechief executive of Nomura, he symbolized the power of Japan'ssecurities industry, both at home and abroad.   Japanese media say that Mr. Tabuchi, who was the mostsenior official at Nomura after the chairman, will besucceeded by Hideo Sakamaki, 56, an executive vice president.Given the scandal sweeping the industry, it isn't surprisingthat Mr. Sakamaki is Nomura's main liaison with the FinanceMinistry.   Finance Ministry officials are concerned that compensatingclients for bad investments contributes to the perceptionthat Tokyo's financial markets are rigged. Paybacks tofavored big clients are perceived as unfair because smallinvestors get no such assurances. In addition, shareholdersof the securities firms are in effect forced to subsidize biginvestors' risks.   Nomura at first dismissed as &quot;Nomura bashing&quot; thenewspaper reports that it made 16 billion yen in compensatorypayments to clients following the market's crash in thebeginning of 1990. But on Friday, Nomura vice presidentYasuhiro Mizuuchi called a news conference at the company'sheadquarters to recant.   Moments later, Nikko executive vice president Masao Yukitold a gathering of reporters at the Tokyo Stock Exchangethat the company had made payments of 17 billion yen tofavored investors. &quot;We are deeply sorry for this incident,which will certainly result in a loss of our credibility,&quot; hesaid.   The two officials denied allegations that their firmspromised investors in advance that they would be compensatedfor losses. Article 50 of Japan's securities and exchange lawprohibits such assurances, but the law doesn't expresslyforbid compensating clients after losses have occurred.   Mr. Mizuuchi and Mr. Yuki ducked questions about theidentity of the compensated clients, but both acknowledgedthat most of the payments had been made to large,institutional clients who invested in so-called eigyo tokkinfunds offered by their firms. The funds, enormously popularwith Japan's big institutional investors in the late 1980s,essentially cede to securities firms the authority to makeclients' investment decisions for them. Controversy hasdogged the funds since their creation. Critics charge thatallowing brokers to play the role of fund manager createsinherent conflicts of interest.   Neither investors nor the securities houses paid much heedto those warnings while share prices were soaring. But whenthe market crashed suddenly in 1990, investors cried foul.They charged the securities houses had mismanaged their moneyand demanded reimbursement, officials at the securities firmssay.   Finance Ministry officials may have seen that problemcoming. At the market's peak, they issued a directive urgingsecurities companies to phase out their eigyo tokkin funds.In the wake of last week's disclosures, the ministry willissue a formal ban on the funds, according to Japanese pressreports.   Mr. Yuki said Nikko has taken disciplinary action againstseven senior company officials for their involvement with thepayments, transfering some of the officials to new positionsand ordering pay cuts for at least four of them. Mr. Mizuuchisaid Nomura employees also have been disciplined inconnection with the payments, but he declined to elaborate.   Mr. Yuki said Nikko is taking steps to ensure that itsemployees avoid making similar paybacks in the future. &quot;Wewill reflect seriously on this matter,&quot; he said, adding thatthe practice of compensating favored customers is an&quot;outmoded way of thinking&quot; that developed during the market'sgo-go years.   But such blandishments may not be enough to put a shine onthe industry's already tarnished image with investors.Indeed, as the securities companies struggled to contain thecompensation scandal, the local press carried reports tyingNomura and Nikko to Susumu Ishii, one of the nation's mostnotorious mobsters.   The press accounts said executives at the main offices ofNomura and Nikko instructed their subsidiaries, NomuraFinance and Nikko Kigyo, to arrange loans for Mr. Ishii tobuy multimillion-dollar golf course memberships. The reportssaid Nomura and Nikko also arranged to extend Mr. Ishii, thealleged former boss of the Inagawa-kai syndicate, loans worth16 billion yen and 20 billion yen, respectively.   Spokesmen for both firms said the transactions werecarried out on Mr. Ishii's behalf at the request of a thirdparty, whom they didn't realize had ties to the gang leader.</TEXT></DOC>
