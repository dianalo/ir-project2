The South-West African People's Organization, which began aguerrilla war against South African rule in 1966, claims SouthAfrica is training a rebel army to overthrow SWAPO if it wins in theballoting Nov. 1.   SWAPO's political opponents hope to win a significant share ofpower and suggest that the guerrilla movement might return toinsurgency rather than join a coalition government.   Both camps fear their rivals will try to intimidate voters, andthere is widespread doubt about the effectiveness of a UnitedNations force of up to 7,500 men due to arrive April 1 to monitorthe election. South Africa worries that the U.N. force will bebiased in SWAPO's favor.   ``My only hope is that we make sure the electoral process is sopeaceful that the result will be accepted by winner and loser, so wedon't have a Lebanon here,'' said Moses Katjiuongua, a black whoserves in the territorial Cabinet and plans to campaign againstSWAPO.   ``We need a mechanism for addressing grievances, so we don't getto a point where SWAPO decides to resume the armed struggle if itloses the election.''   For SWAPO, the political battle is to gain two-thirds of thevote. U.N. Resolution 435, which outlines the independence process,specifies that the assembly elected to draft a new constitution forNamibia, also known as South-West Africa, can act only with supportof two-thirds of the delegates.   SWAPO officials allege that South Africa is bringing Angolans andother non-Namibians into northern districts with the intention ofregistering them as voters. SWAPO also contends that South Africansecurity forces are visiting villages on anti-SWAPO propagandamissions.   South African military headquarters has denied all accusationsthat its forces will interfere with the election.   Although all but 1,500 of South Africa's troops are to bewithdrawn before the formal start of the election campaign June 25,SWAPO officials are concerned that the territorial police forcemight play an intimidating role.   South Africa has agreed to reduce the strength of the policeforce from 8,300 to 7,100, but the smaller force will include mostmembers of Koevoet, a mainly black counter-insurgency unit which isbeing disbanded. Anton Lubowksi, a lawyer who is one of SWAPO's fewwhite members, has charged that Koevoet personnel are ``programmedkillers.''   Jerry Ekandjo, SWAPO's chief spokesman in Windhoek, said SWAPO,if it took power, would conduct a rehabilitation program for formersecurity force members and other Namibians who ``have been misled bythe enemy.''   But SWAPO supporters ``will not take the law into their ownhands,'' he said.   Katjiuongua, the Cabinet member, denounced the proposedrehabilitation program and said a violent reaction was probable if aSWAPO government pursued a policy of ``punish the puppets andtraitors.'' But he denied allegations that South Africa had askedhim to form a rebel army in the event of a SWAPO victory.   The factions opposing SWAPO _ ranging from right-wing whites toformer SWAPO officials _ are engaged in negotiations on possiblealliances. As many as three coalitions, as well as a few individualparties, could compete against the guerrilla movement for supportamong Namibia's 1.3 million people.   ``We are not against the creation of new political parties, butwe're concerned that they are being funded by South Africa with thesole objective of denying SWAPO a two-thirds majority,'' SWAPOofficial Hage Geingob told a recent conference in Zambia. He saidsome of these groups might become ``the terrorists of tomorrow.''   Spokesman Ekandjo, like some other SWAPO officials, refused toeven discuss the possibility that his movement would get less thantwo-thirds of the vote.   ``We've been fighting all these years to win,'' he said.   But Nathaniel Mahuilili, acting president of SWAPO in Namibia,said: ``If we lose, we're not going back to war.''   SWAPO would participate in a coalition, he said, and work toensure outright victory whenever elections next took place.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thu AMs, Jan. 26</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
