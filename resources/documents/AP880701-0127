Bronfman last year calledWaldheim ``part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine.''   Spokesman Gerold Christian, told The Associated Press thatWaldheim cited three reasons for the move in a letter sent to theVienna prosecutor's office.   ``First, the U.S. Justice Department has refused legalassistance, which is in contrast to international legal norms,''and this ruled out a quick court action, Christian said.   ``Second, the (international) commission of historians, privateundertakings as well as international historians have determinedWaldheim's personal innocence.   ``Third, there is an endeavor (on the part of the president) tocontribute to calming down and reconciliation,'' he said.   The U.S. Justice Department said in December 1987 that it hasevidence of Waldheim's complicity in the transfer of civilianprisoners to the Nazi SS for exploitation in labor camps duringWorld War II, the deportations of Jews from Greek islands toconcentration or death camps, the execution of Allied prisoners andthe execution of hostages and other civilians.   Waldheim has denied wrongdoing.   Christian said Waldheim stopped the suit also ``to calm thingsdown for Austria, because the country always has priority overpersonal matters.''   It was believed that Waldheim decided to stop legal proceedingsagainst Bronfman because there was virtually no chance for thecourt action ever to take place in Austria, and even less chancethat it would take place in the United States.   With the Justice Department unwilling to cooperate by havingBronfman testify in a U.S. court, and with Bronfman refusing toappear in an Austrian court, the lawsuit might never have beenresolved.   A report issued by an international commission of historians inFebruary did not say if Waldheim was involved in wartime atrocitiesbut it made clear that as an intelligence officer in the Germanarmy, he was aware of them and did nothing to prevent them.   The document seriousl questioned Waldheim's integrity and led towidespread calls for his resignation, but the Austrian head ofstate refused to comply, insisting that the historians had clearedhim of all charges.   Waldheim called on the Vienna prosecutor's office to sueBronfman on May 7, 1987, two days after the World Jewish Congresspresident said he was ``part and parcel of the Nazi killingmachine'' while serving in the Balkans during the war.   According to a presidential statement issued at the time, thelawsuit was also based on a comment by Bronfman who reportedly saidif Waldheim ``has any patriotism in his soul whatsoever, hisdoctors would find reasons for him to resign his post.''   The third Bronfman comment cited by the president saidWaldheim's ``misdeeds and his lying about his past'' were soobvious that it would be ``almost a crime against humanity to havevery much to do with this man.''</TEXT></DOC>
