The economy is shaky, and skilled professionals and civilservants, mostly Indians, are leaving for Canada, Australia and NewZealand at a rate of 500 a month, double the precoup figure.   Sugar production, the country's major cash crop is down 20.3percent; tourism has dropped 26.9 percent, the currency has beendevalued 33 percent, inflation has tripled to 6 percent,unemployment has reached 7.5 percent and the gross domestic productis down 11 percent.   The coup of May 14, 1987, was led by Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabukawho claimed that a newly elected coalition government dominated bythe decendants of immigrants from India threatened the future ofethnic Fijians.   The Indians outnumbered Fijians 348,704 to 329,305 at the timeand controlled trade and commerce.   The election of an Indian-controlled government led to the armycoup. Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra, a Fijian, and his Cabinet werearrested. The Constitution was suspended and rule by decree was putin force.   Since then ethnic Fijian fears of Indian political supremacyhave eased.   But the coup virtually ended organized political activities, butthe country is now seeing factional and clan rivalries among Fijianchiefs in a feud over a Fijian king.   It was to solve just such rivalries that King Seru Cakobauhanded over the islands, then known as the Cannibal Isles, to QueenVictoria of Britain in 1874, after first having tried to interestthe United States.   Ratu Sir George Cakobau, grandson of the king and a former primeminister, now claims the royal title, which had been vacant sincethe British took control.   But other chiefs and clans are disputing Cakobau's claim to thetitle.   Bavadra, the ousted prime minister, said he feared squabblingamong the chiefs could provoke a violent reaction from Fijiansfeeling the effects of the economic downturn since the coup.   Watching the tribal feuds with interest is the 39-year-oldRabuka, who is a commoner.   He has become a cult figure to many ethnic Fijians who regardhim as the savior of their culture.   He is the minister for home affairs in the interim government heappointed to run the country until a new constitution is draftedand elections held.   A new book, ``Rabuka _ No Other Way,'' giving Rabuka's accountof the coup, became an instant best seller.   Also in demand is an autographed color poster of Rabuka in anarmy T-shirt and bearing the slogan, ``Fiji. In God's Hands.''   A documentary film titled ``Operation Surprise,'' the code namefor the coup, has been showing to packed houses. Fiji has has notelevision.   One of the first acts by Rabuka, a Methodist lay preacher,former rugby star and veteran of the United Nations Middle Eastpeace force was to make the religious observance of Sundayscompulsory.   No shops are allowed to open, no sports can be played, publictransport halts and the populace is expected, but not yetcompelled, to go to church.   But the Sunday observance law has become so unpopular that eventhe Fiji Council of Churches has called for its repeal.   In the best-selling book, written by a Fijian and an Australian,Rabuka says the majority of Fiji's Indians are heathens and shouldbe converted to Christianity. Most of the Indians are Hindus.   ``I don't think they will resent it,'' Rabuka is quoted assaying, ``because all we are trying to do is the same thing thatmissionaries did here in Fiji when we were cannibals and heathens.''   In the year since the coup, Indian leaders have fled or taken alow profile.   But one Indian who remains prominent is Irene Narayan, 56,Rabuka's minister for Indian affairs.   She said in an interview the Indian community is now without apolitical leader, but added she saw little likelihood of communalviolence between Fijians and Indians,.   She expressed the view that while some Indians have left, themajority will remain and probably accept their loss of politicalrights.   ``If Fijians want dominance and they are happy with it, perhapsthat's not high a price for Indians to pay,'' Mrs. Narayan said.   Meanwhile, Fiji's relations with traditonal friends andneighbors are taking time to mend. Australia, New Zealand and theUnited States condemned Rabuka's coup. They called theirambassadors home and suspended aid, but the envoys of all threehave since returned.   Australia and New Zealand have resumed non-military aid, butrelations remain chilly. </TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thu AMs, May 12</NOTE></DOC>
