The basis for this action is a determination by the Assistant Secretary,based on animal and human data, that exposure to MDA at the current occupationalexposure levels causes adverse effects on employee health including anincreased risk of cancer and that limiting occupational exposure to MDAto an eight-hour time weighted average (TWA) of 10 parts per billion (ppb),establishing a short-term exposure limit (STEL) of 100 ppb, and implementingassociated provisions will significantly reduce this risk. In additionto establishing permissible exposure limits (PELs) for MDA, this regulationincludes requirements such as medical surveillance, exposure monitoring,hygiene facilities, engineering controls and work practices, proper respiratoruse, and recordkeeping. An action level of 5 ppb is included in this proposalas a mechanism for exempting employers from the obligation to comply withcertain requirements, such as employee exposure monitoring, in instanceswhere the employer can demonstrate that employee exposures are at or belowthe action level. For the most part, the provisions being proposed by OSHA in these standardswere recommended by the MDA Mediated Rulemaking Advisory Committee (Committee)(52 FR 26776).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments and requests for a hearing concerning the proposedstandard must be postmarked on or before June 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments are to be submitted to the Docket Officer,Docket No. HO40.

Part 1320, which became effective on April30, 1983, and was revised May 10, 1988 (53 FR 16617), sets forth proceduresfor agencies to follow in obtaining OMB clearance for information collectionrequirements. The sections of the proposed MDA standard which may createrecordkeeping requirements are paragraphs on scope and application, exposuremonitoring, methods of compliance, and medical surveillance. In accordance with the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act and theregulations issued pursuant thereto, OSHA certifies that it has submittedthe information collection requirements contained in its proposed ruleon occupational exposure to MDA to OMB for review under section 3504(h)of the Act. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 12,259 hours (or minutes) per response for general industryand 2,872 hours (or minutes) per response for construction, including thetime for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any otheraspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducingthis burden, to the Office of Information Management, Department of Labor,Room N-1301, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210; and tothe Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project, Washington,DC 20503. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory and Legal Authority Background </ITAG>An Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on MDA (48 FR 42836; September20, 1983), was published jointly by the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) and OSHA. The comments and information received in response to thisANPR were submitted to the EPA Docket No. OPTS-64000A and are now a partof the OSHA Docket (H-040). In addition, the record evidence accumulatedand relied upon by the Committee is also available in the OSHA Docket (H-040).On July 5, 1985, EPA published a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice which indicated that any MDA rulemakingwould be referred to OSHA in accordance with section 9 of the Toxic SubstancesControl Act (TSCA) (90 Stat. 2030; 15 U.S.C. 2608) (50 FR 27674). OSHAresponded to this notice in a February 26, 1986 <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice (51 FR 6748) by indicating that a significantrisk at the current workplace levels did exist and that a workplace standardcould significantly reduce this risk.Earlier OSHA indicated in its <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice of October 22, 1985 (50 FR 42789) thatMediated Rulemaking would be used to assist OSHA in its MDA rulemakingactivities. The notice also set forth the basic concepts of negotiatedrulemaking and outlined the participant selection criteria which OSHA expectedto use in establishing an MDA Advisory Committee. OSHA established the committee in accordance with the Federal AdvisoryCommittee Act (FACA) and section 7(b) of the Occupational Safety and HealthAct (OSH Act) to mediate issues associated with the development of a Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on MDA. This notice also solicited participants for the mediation process. As aresult of the request for participants, three unions, the United Auto Workers(UAW), the United Steel Workers of America (USWA) and the Oil, Chemical,and Atomic Workers (OCAW) offered names of potential representatives forthe Committee. OSHA selected representatives from the UAW and Steel Workersto participate in these mediation activities. The International Associationof Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) submitted a request for representationon the Committee and a representative from this group was appointed. Later,as a result of scheduling conflicts, the UAW representative resigned andwas replaced by a labor representative from the United Brotherhood of Carpentersand Joiners of America. In addition to the unions that nominated participants, three trade associationsrepresenting employer groups also expressed an interest in participatingin this rulemaking effort: The National Electrical Manufacturers Association(NEMA), the Suppliers of Advanced Composite Materials Association (SACMA)and the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA). Representatives fromthese groups reflect employer interests in primary and secondary manufacturingand, to some extent, downstream use in the construction industry of MDA.The other recommendations for representation came from the Department ofEnergy, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, theNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), EPA, andthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration for the State of California.A list of the candidates selected, the date of the first meeting, and theagenda for the first meeting were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 3, 1986 (51 FR 24452). OSHA also clearly denoted, in the October 22nd notice, the relevance whichthe Mediated Rulemaking efforts would have on the development of its proposedrule for occupational exposure to MDA:<ITAG tagnum="21">While the Committee's work product will likely serve as the basisfor a proposed rule, it will not negate the need for adherence to traditionalrulemaking procedures. This negotiated rulemaking procedure is supplementalto the normal section 6(b) rulemaking procedures specified in the OSH Actand is intended to aid OSHA in developing a proposed standard for occupationalexposure to MDA (at 42790).</ITAG>Furthermore, OSHA's participation in these mediated rulemaking endeavorswas clearly delineated and was in fact, substantial. OSHA would be an activeparticipant in these efforts. An OSHA representative provided draft regulatorytext and the necessary expertise in standard drafting which the Committeeneeded. To the extent that OSHA could not accept the Committee's recommendationsand use such as its notice of proposed rulemaking, OSHA agreed to publishits rationale for such non-acceptance. In this NPRM OSHA is complying withthe good faith pledge which was made to the Committee and is, for the mostpart, basing its NPRM on the Committee's recommendations. The format of the Preamble of this document reflects both the substanceand the procedure of the mediated rulemaking process. In subsection (A)or (i) of each substantive section, the document discusses the MDA Committeerecommendations which include both the regulatory text and the attendantrationale (see 52 FR 26776, July 16, 1987). In addition, in subsection(B) or (ii) OSHA makes its findings which specifically adopt the Committee'srecommendations, sometimes with further analysis. <ITAG tagnum="71">I.

Introduction </ITAG>A. Background Information <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Need for a Standard </ITAG>EPA issued a notice under section 4(f) of TSCA on April 27, 1983 (48 FR19078) which indicated that MDA presents a significant risk to humans ofserious harm from cancer. EPA was then required to either initiate ``appropriateaction'' or announce that the risk was not ``unreasonable.'' The section 4(f) notice was based on a draft study undertaken by the NationalToxicology Program (NTP). The study demonstrated that the dihydrochloridesalt of MDA is carcinogenic in both sexes of rats and mice at two oraldose levels. This study plus the following factors formed the basis forthe section 4 (f) notice: (1) A lack of any mandatory workplace standard;(2) the apparent inadequacy of protection afforded at the American Conferenceof Governmental Industrial Hygenists (ACGIH) recommended threshold limitvalue (0.1 parts per million (ppm)): (3) evidence that some processorsmay be exceeding even the ACGIH limit: and (4) evidence that several thousandworkers may be exposed. The ``appropriate action'' taken by the Agency was the issuance of an AdvanceNotice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on September 20, 1983 (48 FR 42898).The ANPR announced the joint effort by EPA and OSHA to initiate regulatoryaction to determine and implement the most effective means of controllingoccupational exposure to MDA. At the time of the issuance of the ANPR, only limited data were availableon exposure levels and the number of workers potentially exposed. The ANPRrequested detailed information on the operations used to manufacture andprocess MDA; the potential for exposure at each stage, including air andwork surface monitoring data; and descriptions of workplace practices.The second area of inquiry was the production and use of MDA. Detaileddescriptions of the uses of MDA and updated information of the identityof processors and users was sought. The third area of inquiry was the availability;costs; and the suitability, and toxicity of substitutes for MDA. Finally,information was sought on methods of controlling exposure. The ANPR invitedviews and data from interested parties in any of these areas. In response to the ANPR, comments were received from four parties: DiamondShamrock; National Resources Defense Council, Inc.; DuPont; and CMA. Thesecomments have been analyzed and where appropriate are reflected in thisdocument. On July 5, 1985, EPA published a <T4>Federal Register </T4> notice, in accordance with section 9 TSCA provisions(50 FR 27674) which described the occupational risks associated with workerexposure to MDA and requested that OSHA respond to EPA and indicate whatregulatory activity would be implemented, if any. Under section 9(a)(2)of TSCA, EPA was prohibited from taking any regulatory action pending aresponse from OSHA. In response (51 FR 6748, February 26, 1986), OSHA determined that thereis a reasonable basis to believe that the manufacture and use of MDA presentsa significant risk to the health of exposed workers and that the risk describedby EPA may be eliminated or reduced to a significant extent by a workplacestandard which regulates workers exposure. Further, OSHA determined onthe basis of preliminary data, that the adoption of an occupational standardfor worker exposure to MDA is economically and technologically feasible.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Regulatory Approach </ITAG>In the course of considering an appropriate regulatory action under theOccupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1590; 29 U.S.C. 655)(``OSH Act''), OSHA examined various regulatory scenarios before determiningthe process which might be followed in developing a comprehensive regulationfor occupational exposure to MDA. The Administrative Conference of theUnited States (ACUS) had recently studied the rulemaking process of variousfederal agencies and found that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The complexity of government regulation has increased greatly comparedto that which existed when the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) was enacted,and this complexity has been accompanied by a formalization of the rulemakingprocess beyond the brief expeditious notice and comment procedures envisionedby section 553 of the APA. Procedures in addition to notice and commentmay in some instances provide important safeguards against arbitrary orcapricious decisions by agencies and help ensure that agencies developsound factual basis for the exercise of the discretion entrusted them byCongress, but the increased formalization of the rulemaking process hasalso had adverse consequences. The participants, including the agency,tend to develop adversarial relationships with each other causing themto take extreme positions, to withhold information from one another andto attack the legitimacy of opposing positions. Because of the adversarialrelationships, participants often do not focus on creative solutions toproblems, ranking of the issues involved in a rulemaking, or the importantdetails involved in a rule. Extensive factual records are often developedbeyond what is necessary. Long periods of delay result and participationin rulemaking proceedings can become needlessly expensive. Moreover manyparticipants perceive their roles in the rulemaking proceeding more aspositioning themselves for the subsequent judicial review than as contributingto a solution on the merits at the administrative level. Finally, manyparticipants remain dissatisfied with the policy judgments made at theoutcome of rulemaking proceedings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Recommendation 82-4 ``Procedures for Negotiating Proposed Requlations''47 FR 30708, June 18, 1982).</ITAG>Therefore, ACUS recommended that agencies consider using regulatory mediation,in which the parties in interest identify the major issues, gauge theirimportance, identify the information necessary to resolve the issues, anddevelop a rule that is acceptable to the respective interests, all withinthe contours of the regulatory agency's statute. In considering whether this approach would be suitable in developing regulationscontrolling workplace exposure to MDA, OSHA considered the selection criteriaadopted by the Environmental Protection Agency. (See 49 FR 17576, 17579;April 24, 1984.) OSHA concluded that MDA met the selection criteria formediation: The regulatory effort was at the pre-proposal phase of development;affected parties were relatively few in number and readily identifiable;there were indications that affected parties would mediate in good faith;and sufficient information was available to resolve key issues. Thus, OSHAemployed mediated rulemaking in developing an occupational standard forworker exposure to MDA. A number of parties interested in OSHA affairs have expressed concern regardingthe use of mediated rulemaking in developing complex health regulations.Strictly speaking, it appears inappropriate to suggest that human sufferingand lives become the trade off items in a mediation attempt. The Agency'suse of mediated rulemaking in this instance did not anticipate that thatwould be the methodology of these endeavors. Instead, OSHA expected toproduce a consensus recommendation on the various aspects or issues involvedin developing a complex health standard. This differs from the typicallabor management negotiations where one or two issues must be resolvedand bargaining or trade off become the method to form a compromise. Thekey difference here involves the final product expected. On the one handa compromise is reached: on the other hand a consensus is achieved. In addition, OSHA's approach entailed the Agency setting forth the issueson which the Committee must come to consensus. OSHA had the knowledge andexperience needed to develop complex health standards. Furthermore, OSHAis cognizant of its own legal requirements and limitations. Thus, OSHAprovided the Committee with the issues to be resolved, the record evidenceaccumulated to date, and the suggested draft regulatory language. The Committeeused the record evidence and draft language provided by OSHA, along withinformation supplied by some of its members and, of course, the personalexpertise of its members to achieve its consensus recommendations. Therecommendations developed by the Committee reflect the consensus reachedregarding the risk associated with occupational exposure to MDA, the PELsand standard provisions necessary to reduce this risk, and the technologicaland economic feasibility of implementing these recommended standards. TheCommittee's Products were comprehensive regulations with accompanying rationales.The Committee also agreed that unanimous agreement to all the issues wasnot necessary for consensus to be reached. This is different than typicalnegotiations in which all the issues must be resolved in order to culminatesuccessfully. OSHA also required that the Committee be established in accordance with,and that it follow the requirements established by, the Federal AdvisoryCommittee Act (5 U.S.C. App. 1). The Mediated Rulemaking Committee wasset up in the fashion that OSHA previously had established Advisory Committeesunder section 7(b) of the Act. Thus, all the Committee's meetings unliketypical labor/management negotiations were open to the public and a recordwas kept and made available to the public. Further, representation of the interests involved was mandatory; not representationof all the parties but of all the interests. The recommendations proposedby this consensus building group were developed by representatives fromlabor, management, and state and federal interests. The Committee met formally on seven occasions. The first meeting consistedof organizational activities (defining consensus, establishing agendasand topics for discussions). The subsequent meetings were used to developconsensus recommendations. The last meeting ended on May 21, 1987. In thismeeting the Committee made and rendered its final recommendations on theproposed standards regulating occupational exposure to MDA in both generaland the construction industry to the Assistant Secretary. These recommendationswere published on July 16, 1987 (50 FR 26776). OSHA has based this NPRM primarily upon the recommendations made by theCommittee. Furthermore, in the infrequent situations where the Committee'srecommendations could not be used by OSHA in its NPRM, OSHA, as agreed,has provided its rationale for this non-acceptance. OSHA has also consulted as required by section 107(e) of the Contract WorkHours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 333 (e)); and section 7(b) ofthe OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 656); and (29 CFR 1912.3), with the ConstructionAdvisory Committee concerning this proposed rule for Construction. Thismeeting took place on November 3, 1987. This Committee recommended thatOSHA adopt the recommendations made by the MDA Mediated Rulemaking AdvisoryCommittee for the construction industry and use such as the basis for itsNPRM for construction. B. Physical Properties, Manufacture, and Uses of MDA Methylenedianiline (CAS 101-77-9) (MDA) is a light brown, or tan, crystallinesolid with a faint amino-like odor. MDA is slightly soluble in water andvery soluble in alcohol and benzene. MDA is produced commercially by thecondensation of aniline and formaldehyde. Crude MDA (40-60% MDA) is a liquidor a hard wax-like substance. Purified (99%) MDA is in the form of eitherlight yellow crystalline flakes or white granules. Ninety-eight percent of the MDA produced is used directly in the manufactureof methylenediphenyl diiosocyanate (MDI), the remaining two percent isused as a precursor for the manufacture of plastic fibers, antioxidants,dyestuff intermediates, corrosion preventatives, and special polymers.The MDI is produced in two grades, monomeric (pure) and polymeric. Ninetypercent of the crude MDA is used to produce polymeric MDI, and another8% of the crude MDA is converted to monomeric MDI. MDI is used to produceflexible and rigid polyurethane foams, elastomers, coatings, thermoplasticresins, foundry core binders, adhesives, sealants, and spandex fibers.The remaining MDA is produced in the pure form for other uses: epoxy resincuring agents, wire coating applications, polyurethane co-reactants, inpigments and dyes, and defense applications. There are eleven principal industry sectors where workers are potentiallyexposed to MDA. These sectors are: (1) MDA Production for MDI Synthesis/MDASale and Import; (2) Reprocessing; (3) Filament Winding; (4) Potting andEncapsulation; (5) Molding/Bonding of Tools and Specialty Small Parts;(6) Wire Coating; (7) Coatings; (8) Intermediate for TGMDA and PACM-20Production; (9) Polyurethane Curing; (10) Advanced Composite MaterialsProduction; and ( 11) Use of PMR-15 Pre-preg Materials. There are alsoseven other industrial sectors where MDA was once used and may still beused limitedly. These minor sectors are: (1) Coatings (Polybismalimides)of Printed Circuit Boards and Fabrication of Airplane Parts; (2) Dyes andPigments; (3) Quiana Yarn; (4) Intermediate for Pharmaceuticals, Herbicides,etc.; (5) Rubber Processing; (6) Anti-Oxidants; and (7) Ketamine Production.Maintenance workers have been separately identified from each of thesesectors for purposes of analysis. There are six firms which produce MDA for MDI production, MDA for sale,or which import MDA. MDA is manufactured by 6 companies at 7 locationsin four states: Dow Chemical Co. (LaPorte, TX); BASF (Geismar, LA); E.I.DuPont (Belle, WV); Mobay Chemical (New Martinsville, WV and Baytown, TX);Rubicon Chemical (Geismar, LA); and Uniroyal Chemicals division of Avery(Naugtuck, CT). Three of these companies, Mobay, Rubicon, and Dow accountfor over 90% of the MDA production. It is estimated that approximately600 million pounds of MDA are produced for MDI conversion, 4,474,000 poundsare produced domestically for sale, and an additional 1.8 million poundsare imported. In addition, it is estimated that the percentage of MDA inthe product made domestically ranges from 40-70% while the percentage inthe imported product is approximately 98%. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Pertinent Legal Authority </ITAG>Authority for issuance of this standard is found primarily in sections6(b), 8(c), and 8(g)(2) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970(the Act), 29 U.S.C. 655(b), 657(c), and 657(g)(2). Section 6(b)(5) governsthe issuance of occupational safety and health standards dealing with toxicmaterials or harmful physical agents. Section 3(8) of the Act (29 U.S.C.652(8)), defines an occupational safety and health standard as:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or useof one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonablynecessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and placesof employment.</ITAG>The Supreme Court has said that section 3(8) applies to all permanent standardspromulgated under the Act and requires the Secretary, before issuing anystandard, to determine that it is reasonably necessary and appropriateto remedy a significant risk of material health impairment. <T3>Industrial Union Department </T3>v. <T3>American Petroleum Institute</T3>, 448 U.S. 607 (1980). The ``significant risk'' determination constitutes a finding that, absentthe change in practices mandated by the standard, the workplaces in questionwould be ``unsafe'' in the sense that workers would be threatened witha significant risk of harm. <T3>Id. </T3>at 642. A significant risk finding, however, does not requiremathematical precision or anything approaching scientific certainty ifthe ``best available evidence'' does not warrant that degree of proof.<T3>Id. </T3>at 655-656; 29 U.S.C. 655 (b)(5). Rather, the Agency may baseits finding largely on policy considerations and has considerable leewaywith the kinds of assumptions it applies in interpreting the data supportingit. <T3>Id. </T3>655-656; 29 U.S.C. 655(b)(5). The Court's opinion indicatesthat risk assessments, which may involve mathematical estimates with someinherent uncertainties, are a means of demonstrating the existence of significantrisk. After OSHA has determined that a significant risk exists and that suchrisk can be reduced or eliminated by the proposed standard, it must setthe standard ``which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible onthe basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffermaterial impairment of health * * *''. Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. TheSupreme Court has interpreted this section to mean that OSHA must enactthe most protective standard necessary to eliminate a significant riskof material health impairment, subject to the constraints of technologicaland economic feasibility. <T3>American Textile Manufacturers Institute, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Donovan</T3>, 452 U.S. 490 (1981). The Court held that ``cost-benefitanalysis is not required by the statute because feasibility analysis is.''<T3>Id. </T3>at 509. Authority to issue this standard is also found in section 8(c) of the Act.In general, this secrion requires the Secretary to require employers tomake, keep, and preserve records regarding activities related to the Act.In particular, section 8(c)(3) gives the Secretary authority to requireemployers to ``maintain accurate records of employee exposures to potentiallytoxic materials or harmful physical agents which are required to be monitoredor measured under section 6.'' Provisions of OSHA standards which requirethe making and maintenance of records of medical examinations, exposuremonitoring, and the like are issued pursuant to section 8(c) of the Act.The Secretary's authority to issue this proposed standard is further supportedby the general rulemaking authoriry granted in section 8(g)(2) of the Act.This section empowers the Secretary ``to prescribe such rules and regulationsas he may deem necessary to carry out (his) responsibilities under theAct''_in this case as part of or ancillary to, a section 6(b) standard.The Secretary's responsibilities under the Act are defined largely by itsenumerated purposes, which include:Encouraging employers and employees in their efforts to reduce the numberof occupational safety and health hazards at their places of employment,and to stimulate employers and employees to institute new and to perfectexisting programs for providing safe and healthful working conditions (29U.S.C. 651(b)(1)); Setting mandatory occupational safety and health standards applicable tobusiness affecting interstate commerce, and by creating an OccupationalSafety and Health Review Commission for carrying out adjudicatory functionsunder the Act (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(3)); Building upon advances already made through employee and employer initiativefor providing safe and healthful working conditions (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(4));Providing for the development and promulgation of occupational safety andhealth standards (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(9)); Providing for appropriate reporting procedures with respect to occupationalsafety and health which procedures will help achieve the objectives ofthis Act and accurately describe the nature of the occupational safetyand health problem (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(12)); Exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishing causal connectionsbetween diseases and work in environmental conditions * * *. (29 U.S.C.651(b)(6));Encouraging joint labor-management efforts to reduce injuries and diseasesarising out of employment (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(13)); and Developing innovative methods, techniques, and approaches for dealing withoccupational safety and health problems (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(5)). Because the MDA standard is reasonably related to these statutory goals,the Secretary finds that this standard is necessary to carry out his responsibilitiesunder the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Health Effects </ITAG>A. Summary of the Committee's Recommendations <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction </ITAG>The Committee reviewed the record evidence concerning the acute and chroniceffects of exposure to MDA in both animals and humans and concluded thatMDA should be treated as a hepatotoxic agent and as a suspect human carcinogen.The Committee also concluded that an occupational standard regulating workerexposure to MDA should be developed. The following discussion providesthe Committee's findings with respect to the hepatotoxic and carcinogenichazards posed by occupational exposure to MDA. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Acute Effects of Exposure to MDA </ITAG>a. <T3>Hepatotoxicity. </T3>The record evidence on the acute effects of occupationalexposure to MDA indicates that occupational exposure to MDA may resultin hepatotoxicity (poisoning of the liver). The Committee relied on anabundance of human and animal data to support this finding. (See HepatotoxicitySection of the Committee's Document, Ex. 9.) The Committee found that one or a few exposures to high doses of MDA mayresult in toxic hepatitis. However, in all cases the clinical signs andsymptoms of hepatitis produced by this exposure were reversible. The Committee'sdiscussion concerning the acute effects resulting from acute exposurescan be found at 52 FR 26779 and 26780. In summary the Committee statedclearly that ``The predominance of data reflect the induction of diseaseas a result of dermal absorption of MDA'' and further provides a data analysisfrom Kopelman, McGill and Motto, and Brooks et al. An analysis of the datadid not rule out the possibility that liver toxicity might result fromlow doses. Furthermore, the analysis did not determine the effects longterm low dosing might have on liver function. However, the Committee tentativelydid conclude that at the present occupational levels the clinically observednon-neoplastic effects of exposure to MDA appear to be totally reversible.This conclusion was based solely on review of the data found in the acutehuman studies (human chronic exposure studies are not available). Animaldata however, did indicate that long term MDA dosing at low levels producedvarious levels of liver damage. Thus while making a finding that occupationalexposure to MDA may result in liver toxicity, the Committee was unableto develop dose-response data which could predict with some certainty theexposure necessary to produce liver toxicity. More precisely, the Committeewas unable to conclude that at 5 ppb, liver toxicity would not occur. In an effort to make these findings, the Committee extensively reviewedthe record evidence to determine the levels of exposure at which a No ObservedEffect Level (NOEL) for the clinical observation of hepatitis could beexpected to occur in a worker population. The available literature on workersoccupationally exposed to MDA provided limited data on the occupationaldoses to which the workers were exposed. This is due in part to a lackof ambient sampling data but more often because the primary mode of exposurewas through the skin and not through inhalation. The Committee furtheracknowledged that in the case of MDA, unlike many acutely toxic chemicalswhich are associated with acute inhalation effects such as irritation andpulmonary edema, the primary effect has been liver damage following ingestionor skin absorption. The only available data the Committee could use toestimate a NOEL for liver toxicity due to occupational exposure to MDAare the data reported by Kopelman <T3>et al. </T3>from the Epping Jaundice incident. This data suggestedthat levels in excess of 100 ppb would be necessary to produce acute hepatitisin worker populations. The Committee relied on these findings in makingits recommendations for the TWA and the STEL. b. <T3>Dermal Irritation. </T3>The Committee believed that the ability ofMDA to induce contact sensitization has not been studied sufficiently toconclude that MDA causes sensitization. c. <T3>Retinal Effects. </T3>The Committee reviewed the record evidence concerningthe effects which might result from eye contact with MDA. The Committeeconcluded that direct contact between MDA and the eye should be avoided.In addition, the Committee noted that ingestion of MDA might also resultin damage to the eye and as such should also be avoided. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Chronic Effects of Exposure to MDA </ITAG>a. <T3>Hepatotoxicity. </T3>The Committee found that at the present occupationallevels, the observed or clinical non-neoplastic effects resulting fromexposure appear to be totally reversible (Ex. 9). This conclusion is basedon review of the data found in the acute human studies. Animal data indicatethat long term MDA dosing at low levels produces various levels of liverdamage, but since most of the studies have involved the dosing of the animalsuntil sacrifice, it is difficult to determine if the observed effects wouldor could have been reversed if sufficient time had been allotted for healing.b. <T3>Carcinogenicity. </T3>The Committee concluded that MDA is a carcinogenin F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex. Furthermore, it appears thatcarcinogenicity is induced either through ingestion, inhalation, or dermalabsorption of the substance.The Committee considered extensively the type of data needed to determinecarcinogenicity in animals and to relate the observed effects in animalswith that expected in humans. The Committee generally accepted the policyset forth by public health agencies, that test results in mammalian species(including the mouse), are acceptable data for predicting potential hazardsto exposed humans. The Committee also recognized that confounding factors associated withlong term bioassays could cause carcinogenicity findings to be questioned.First, the Committee recognized the need to use control groups, as wasdone in the NTP and ORNL bioassays, and to validate the carcinogenic findingsin rodent species that normally exhibit a high spontaneous incidence oftumors. Second the Committee also discussed the effect that high dosing and subsequentacute toxicity may have on the production of liver and thyroid tumors foundin the female mice of the NTP study. The Committee determined that theobserved incidence of tumors found in the female mice of the NTP studydid not occur as a result of high dosing but occurred from exposure toMDA. Third the Committee noted that the presence of tumor viruses in mice doesnot necessarily invalidate the identification of MDA as a carcinogen. Inmaking this determination, the Committee made use of the policies advocatedby numerous health agencies, including OSHA, which require that, to makea viral etiology finding, the virus must be established to be the soledirect mechanism producing the carcinogenic effect. Not finding this necessaryevidence, the Committee agreed that the carcinogenic response was not theresult of viral etiology. The Committee found that the NTP study was conducted properly, and thereforeused this study as the principal basis for its carcinogenicity findings.In addition, a majority of the Committee members concluded that 9DA inducescancer by a genotoxic rather than a non-genotoxic mechanism and, as such,a threshold level for the carcinogenic response did not exist. The Committeeconcluded that the evidence offered for the existence of thresholds forthis carcinogen was insufficient to overcome the extant evidence for agenotoxic mechanism. The Committee relied on two basic concepts to makethis decision. First, the members required that if a threshold was to beconsidered, data indicating at what level a threshold would occur mustbe provided. Secondly, once a threshold is established in experimentalanimals, the threshold must be shown to be applicable to any exposed groupof workers. No evidence was offered which meets these minimum criteriaand thus the Committee made a recommendation that a no-threshold-effectbe used to predict the risk associated with occupational exposure to MDA.In addition, the Committee believed that, even if a threshold for specificcarcinogens could be demonstrated in experimental test animals or evenin a specific human population, it might not be applicable to any givenhuman population at risk. No data were furnished which equated a thresholdobserved in animals with that expected in humans. Other concerns raised by some of the Committee members involve the useof MDA dihydrochloride rather than MDA itself as the administered dosein the NTP bioassays. The Committee noted that test animals in the OakRidge National Laboratories study were exposed dermally to MDA and notthe hydrochloride as in the NTP study. Furthermore, the Committee notedthat in the Oak Ridge test animals the carcinogenic response seen in thefemale mouse livers was approximately double that noted in the NTP study.Thus, the Committee concluded that exposure to MDA produced the carcinogeniceffect, and not exposure to the salt. The Committee also examined supportive evidence of carcinogenicity derivedfrom short term mutagenicity tests. The Committee recognized that the variousshort-term tests do not measure the same mutagenic endpoint; thus positiveand negative findings are not uncommon, since no single short-term testcan measure all the events which might lead to mutagenesis. The Committeeagreed that there is a wide variety of opinions on the reliability of usingshort-term studies as indicators of potential carcinogenicity. Many ofthe Committee members believed, however, that such tests provide meaningfulindicative results and that substances which give positive results in wellvalidated systems are likely to be carcinogenic. Further, it appears thatthe probability of a false-positive result for a chemical which is positivein one well-conducted bioassay and one well-validated short term-test isextremely small. Thus, based on record evidence consisting of both bioassaysand short-term tests the Committee concluded that MDA causes cancer inexperimental animals. The Committee also analyzed the data to relate the findings of ``pooledtumors'' incidence in mice to some common site in man. The Committee acknowledgedthat scientific investigations have shown that target sites for the carcinogenicaction of a substance in humans are not necessarily the same as those foundin animal experiments. There were basically three pieces of suggestiveevidence examined by the Committee to link the carcinogenic response inanimals to the expected response in humans (bladder cancer):(1) The NIOSH-Vertol Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) study (Ex. 1-255);(2) The presence of bladder transitional cell papillomas in three MDA treatedrats in the NTP-Bioassay (Ex. 1-36); and (3) Some structure-activity links with the proven human and animal bladdercarcinogen, benzidine, and the dog bladder carcinogen, methylenebis-(2-chloroaniline)(MBOCA).The only available human data implicating MDA as a human carcinogen werefrom the HHE. The Committee reviewed these data thoroughly before concludingthat the data were insufficient to positively identify MDA as a human bladdercarcinogen or to use the data contained in this report to establish permissibleexposure limits. However, the Committee did not exclude the fact that thereport did develop a hypothesis regarding MDA exposure and bladder cancerwhich warrants further investigation using the more rigorous epidemiologicmethods. The Committee also found that the development of bladder transitional cellpapillomas in the female rats in the NTP bioassays to be significant. Theserelatively rare tumors were benign although progression to malignancy inthis class of tumors may occur. Furthermore, the Committee recognized thatthe appearance of transitional cell papillomas in MDA treated rats wasunique and demonstrated the chemical specificity of the results observed.The Committee analyzed the structure activity relationships between MDAand several other substances identified by EPA as structural analogs. Amajority of the Committee members maintained that there are significantstructural differences between benzidine and MDA and that a strong analogydoes not exist. The Committee generally believed, however, that while thestructural analogy data are not conclusive, nonetheless these data shouldbe relied upon to suggest that MDA may cause bladder cancer in humans.Although the Committee could not positively link occupational exposureto MDA with bladder cancer in workers, the Committee recommended stringentstandard provisions to protect workers against the carcinogenic potentialposed by MDA regardless of the target site. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Reproductive Effects </ITAG>The majority of the Committee members concluded that, while the data suggestthat there may be hormonal changes at relatively high doses, the occupationalsignificance of these changes could not be assessed. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Teratogenic Effects </ITAG>The Committee has reviewed the data on the teratogenic effects of exposureto MDA and could not relate the significance of these observed effectsin animals with those anticipated in the occupational setting. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Absorption, Distribution, and Deposition </ITAG>The majority of the Committee members agreed that where sufficient dataexist which are MDA specific (e.g., dermal absorption data), these datashould be used to determine the biological activity of the chemical. However,the Committee found that data obtained through the El-Hawari study (Ex.1-251) were not sufficient to make determinations concerning the gastro-intestinaland respiratory absorption of MDA. The Committee anticipated that futureresearch on the gastrointestinal and respiratory absorption of MDA willalso substantiate the findings made from the structural analogue comparisonsand demonstrate that these assumptions are also conservative. The Committee agreed that a 100% absorption through the gastro-intestinaltract of the mouse be used in generating the risk assessment model ratherthan 50% absorption proposed by EPA. The Committee realizes that this isa conservative approach because it assumes that the observed effect isa result of absorption of the entire dose administered and not a resultof the absorption of a lesser portion of the administered dose. This assumptionhas the effect of reducing the expected risks predictable from occupationalexposure to MDA by 50%. The Committee agreed, however, with EPA's assumption that absorption throughlung tissue is roughly equivalent to gastro-intestinal absorption (50%),especially if MDA is in the vapor phase or has a particle size of lessthan 2 microns. The Committee also concluded that MDA is actually dermally absorbed atapproximately 2% per hour and not 1% as previously assumed (Ex. 1-251).Therefore, an absorption rate of 2% can also be applied to MDA exposurewhich occurs through dermal deposition and absorption. The Committee also stressed the significance which the hazard of derma1exposure posed. Data from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory study (Ex.8) heightened the Committee's concern over these hazards. The Committeeconcluded that when a chemical is ingested, it is transported through thehepatocellular detoxification system and is not generally diluted as aresult of passing through the general circulatory system. In the case ofchemicals applied to the skin, however, a significant dilution takes placeas a result of the absorbed chemical passing through the general circulatorysystem before passing through the hepatocellular detoxification system.Compared with the findings of the NTP study in which animals were exposedthrough ingestion, the Oak Ridge data reported almost a two-fold increasein the liver tumor incidence observed in the female test animals dermallyexposed to MDA. These findings are additional evidence that occupationaldermal exposure to MDA should be prevented. In addition, the Committee was concerned with the findings of El-Harawi(Ex. 1-251) indicating that once deposired on the skin, MDA cannot be completelyremoved by cleansing. The data suggest that the use of solvents to removeMDA from the skin actually increases the absorption of MDA. It also appearsthat soap and water provide the best medium for removing the substancefrom the skin, but only remove approximately 60% of the material depositedon the skin. These findings support the provisions to the recommended standardwhich require the use of personal protective clothing and equipment toprevent MDA exposure and medical surveillance to assure that the integrityof the protective equipment and clothing is being maintained. B. OSHA's Findings OSHA has reviewed the record evidence concerning the acute and chroniceffects of exposure to MDA in both animals and humans. OSHA has also reviewedthe recommendations made by the Committee regarding the health effectsassociated with occupational exposure to MDA and agrees that the Committeehas properly evaluated the record evidence and that their recommendationsare appropriate. OSHA also agrees with the Committee's assessment of thecarcinogenic potential posed by occupational exposure to MDA and concludesalso that MDA be treated as a human carcinogen for regulatory purposes.Regarding the use of a NOEL, OSHA found that the Committee's findings thatadverse hepatotoxic effects do not occur until well above the 100 ppb STELto be somewhat imprecise. Kopelman et al. (Ex. 1-69, 1966) reported onclinical findings of acute hepatitis resulting from MDA contaminated breadingested by humans in a non-occupational setting. The investigators clearlystate that it was not possible to determine whether the individuals atethe bread on one or several occasions or how much bread they consumed peroccasion. The actual level of MDA consumed by any individual varied accordingto the amount of bread comsumed and the degree of contamination of theflour used to bake individual loaves of bread. The average dose which theinvestigators estimated was based on the percentage of MDA found in thebread and the weight of the average loaf of bread. At no time was the amountof bread ingested and the observed clinical effects of exposure experiencedby the individual workers correlated. Other investigators such as Maltenet al. (Ex. 1-71, 1973) and Kopelman et al. (Ex. 1-68, 1966) performedseveral studies in animals using extracts of the bread involved in theEpping jaundice outbreak. In each of these studies, with varying dosesof exposure liver changes and ``toxic manifestations'' were noted. OSHA recognizes the significances which establishing a NOEL has on recommendingacceptable TWA's and STEL's. OSHA finds it imprecise to use the data whichthe Committee used in establishing its NOEL to establish either a TWA ora STEL. OSHA does note the difficulty which the Committee experienced withrespect to establishing a NOEL and subsequently recommended a TWA and STELfrom these data. Firstly, OSHA recognizes as did the Committee that thedata are somewhat scant regarding the correlation of observable clinicaleffects of exposure with occupational doses. Secondly, OSHA recognizesas did the Committee that the predominance of human occupationally relateddata indicates that clinical manifestations of disease result from thedermal absorption of MDA and that there was no correlation made to equateclinical manifestations of hepatitis with dermal absorption (although,correlations between skin absorption and potential cancer development weremade). Thirdly, OSHA recognizes as did the Committee that the availablehuman data involve only the observation of clinical manifestations andcessation of disease and that none of the data refer to acute effects (e.g.,changes in liver function or subclinical indicators of disease in acutelyexposed workers or chronically exposed workers). While the Committee did attempt to make some computations regarding inhalationdoses and expected observable clinical manifestations of disease, the Committeebelieved that relying totally on these computations to establish Pels whichwould prevent liver toxicity in occupationally exposed workers is not acceptableand OSHA agrees with this finding. Thus, both OSHA and the Committee consideredother facrors in establishing the TWA and the STEL (See PEL discussion).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Risk Assessment </ITAG>A. Summary of the Committee's Recommendations Having analyzed all the data and the respective scenarios with their variedassumptions the Committee agreed that it was impractical to consider riskas ranges for the purpose of establishing permissible exposure limits inthat the ranges of risk and the associated permissible exposure limitsvary too greatly. Furthermore, having examined all of the scenarios andthe varied assumptions, the Committee believed that the following assumptionsand risk estimates will offer the best description of occupational riskassociated with worker exposure to MDA (See Ex. 9, Risk Assessment Section):1. Qualitatively, the dose-response in animals is similar to that in humans.2. The one-stage linear mathematical model was selected and is assumedto hold for doses outside the range of observation. 3. There is no threshold for all effects. 4. Gastro-intestinal absorption for rats and mice is assumed to be 100%.5. The target organ in test animals is not necessarily the same as thetarget organ in humans. 6. The average amount of MDA-2HCl containing water consumed daily (5.0gm) divided by the average animal body weight (mice) in grams (38.0 gm)can be used to estimate dose. The Committee recognizes that OSHA calculated the exact weights of theanimals used in the NTP study rather than using a standard weight for theanimals as was done by EPA. The Committee agreed that it is more accurateto use the average of the exact weights rather than an assumed weight.7. Body weight conversion is used rather than the surface area conversionfor extrapolating from animal data to humans. The Committee recognized that there is much scientific controversy overthe use of surface area scaling factors for conversion of doses from animalsto man. However, the Committee believed that evidence has not been presentedwhich indicates that it is more appropriate to use the surface area scalingfactor and therefore recommended the use of the body weight conversionfactor. 8. The daily occupational dose from inhalation was based upon 50% absorptionof MDA through the lungs at 1.2 m 3/hr respiration rate. 9. The daily occupational dose from dermal exposure was assumed to be directlyproportional to a combination of deposition rate, absorption rate, bodysurface areas determined by Snyder <T3>et al., </T3>and \1/2\ of the square of exposure time (per shift).The total surface areas assumed to be potentially exposed and thus usedin these computations can be found in Exhibit 9. 10. Deposition rate of MDA from dermal exposure was assumed to be uniformover time and absorption through all skin areas to be at a uniform rateof 2% per hour of deposited material. (See Absorption Section.) 11. The worker's lifetime risk (through age 74) was calculated on exposuresof 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, 46 weeks per year for 45 years startingat age 20. The Committee agreed to recommend that 8 hours/day of exposure be usedto generate risk estimates. The Committee recognized, however, that thisassumption might lead to risk estimates that greatly overstate the risksto workers exposed to MDA for less than 8 hours per day. There are severalreasons why the Committee took this position. In most industrial settingsand other work environments, employee exposures to harmful substances areregular and long term in nature. Based upon the limited data presentlyavailable, however, the Committee believed that a substantial number ofemployees may be exposed to MDA on a somewhat irregular or intermittentbasis. A wide variety of factors makes it difficult to account for thesehighly intermittent exposure patterns in a quantitative manner. There isno widely accepted risk model presently in use which takes into accountthe effects of intermittent exposure. There may be elimination or deactivationof MDA to some extent when it is introduced into the system in small quantitiesat infrequent intervals. Also very little deactivation or repair may occurdespite relatively sporadic exposures. Such a highly intermittent exposurepattern may, at least theoretically, allow for the repair of damaged systemsor cells. These factors may result in a greater reduction of risk thana model simply adjusted for decreased exposure time might reflect. Therefore,the Committee felt that limitations in the available data and science aresuch that a credible quantifiable extrapolation of risk for intermittentexposure to MDA is not possible at this time. Secondly, the Committee recommended that occupational exposure data reflectan 8-hour day, a 40 hour work week, over a 45 year working lifetime. Thesethree assumptions are also standard OSHA policy assumptions. OSHA has comeunder some criticism for relying on these assumptions. It is charged thatOSHA errs toward over prediction of risk by assuming, without substantiation,that workers will experience exposures at the PEL of the standard for upto 45 years. While theoretically possible, the Committee agreed it is notthe workplace norm for workers to be exposed for 8 hours per day, 40 hoursper week for a 45 year period. However, when determining whether a hazardoussubstance poses a significant risk and that reduction of a PEL is warranted,the Committee realized that OSHA is bound to consider what degree of riskwould be permitted by the existing standard, even though many workers mayin fact be at lesser risk because their exposures are to levels below orof a shorter duration than those required by that standard. The Committeerecognized that it is for this reason that OSHA bases its determinationsof significant risk on the assumption that exposure at the PEL occurs throughoutthe entire workday. Thirdly, the Committee acknowledged that the use of the lifetime exposure(45-year) assumption is based on guidance given in the OSH Act. As specifiedin section 6(b)(5):<ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary in promulgaring standards dealing with toxic materialsor harmful physical agents under this subsection, shall set the standardwhich most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis ofthe best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairmentof health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposureto the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his workinglife.</ITAG>OSHA believes that it is reasonable to assume that a person begins workat age 20 and continues until the age of 65, a 45 year span of employment.Under section 6(b)(5) of the Act, OSHA is compelled to promulgate standardsthat ensure that employees, even those exposed to the hazardous agent fortheir entire working lifetime, are at the lowest risk that can feasiblybe attained. Therefore, OSHA's determinations of significant risk musttake into account the fact that many workers may be exposed throughouttheir entire working lives, and reflects the view that OSHA is regulatingworkplace conditions and not specific employees. Having considered these various assumptions the Committee selected fromthese considerations what it felt to be the most reasonable assumptionsand recommended that OSHA use the risk estimates found in Table 1 below(Table 49, Ex. 1-269). The underlying assumptions used in predicting theserisks are: (1) l00% GI absorption; (2) 2, 4 hr work shifts; (3) 2% dermalabsorption rate; (4) non-surface area correction factor; and (5) upperbody absorption set forth in Scenario III.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4><T4> 49_</T4><T4>Mediated Rulemaking Committee's Recommended Table for Estimated ExcessOccupational Lifetime Cancer Risk for Workers Exposed to MDA</T4>a <T4>Table Has Not Been Surface Area Corrected </T4>100% GI/2-4 hr/2% <T4>Assumes Dermal, Absorption in Scenario III </T4><H1>CASE</H1><H1>Type of MDA plants </H1><H1>Airborne</H1>b Level mg/m3 (ppm andamp; ppb) <H1>Dermal</H1>c deposition ug/cm\2\/hr<H1>Inhalational exposure mg/kg/day </H1><H1>Dermal exposure mg/kg/day </H1><H1>Total exposure mg/kg/day </H1><H1>MLE (U95CL)</H1>d excess cancer risk <H1>Comments</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">I(a) <D>Manufacturing </D><D>0.57 (0.070 ppm) (70 ppb) </D><D>9.0 (palms) 2.5 (upper) body, etc.) </D><D>0.021 </D><D>0.0749 </D><D>0.0959 </D><D>6(7)/1000 </D><D>Worst existing case. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(b) <D>Processing </D><D>0.38 (0.047 ppm) (47 ppb) </D><D>250 (palms) 27 (upper body etc.) </D><D>0.014 </D><D>0.4186 </D><D>0.4326 </D><D>3(3)/100 </D><D>Worst existing case. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">II(a) <D>Manufacturing processing (dermal only) </D><D>0.00 </D><D>4.2 </D><D>0.00 </D><D>0.0041 </D><D>0.0041 </D><D>3(3)/10,000 </D><D>Existing case with (zero airborne level) lowest dermal deposition. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(b) <D>Manufacturing processing </D><D>0.00 </D><D>2.1 </D><D>0.00 </D><D>0.0021 </D><D>0.0021 </D><D>1(2)/10,000 </D><D>Proposed case with (zero airborne level) lowest dermal reduced \1/2\.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">III(a) <D>Manufacturing </D><D>0.01 mg/m\3\ (.0012ppm) (1 ppb) </D><D>0.03 </D><D>0.00036 </D><D>0.00087 </D><D>0.0012 </D><D>8(9)/100,000 </D><D>Proposed case with upper body absorption feasible to monitor. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(b) <D>Manufacturing </D><D>0.001 (.00012ppm) (.12ppb) </D><D>0.003 </D><D>0.000036 </D><D>0.000087 </D><D>0.00012 </D><D>7(9)/M </D><D>Proposed case with upper body absorption deposition; not feasible tomonitor and not sure about maintenance. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(c) <D>Manufacturing </D><D>0.0001 (.00001ppm) (.012ppb) </D><D>0.0003 </D><D>0.0000036 </D><D>0.0000087 </D><D>0.000012 </D><D>7(9)/10M </D><D>Proposed case with zero dermal deposition; not sure if feasible to monitoror maintain. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(d) <D> </D><D>0.16 (0.020ppm) (20 ppb) </D><D>0.6 </D><D>0.0072 </D><D>0.0175 </D><D>0.0247 </D><D>2(2)/1000 </D><D>Proposed case with upper body absorption; feasible to monitor and maintain.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(e) <D> </D><D>0.1 mg/m\3\ (.01 ppm) (10 ppb) </D><D>0.3 </D><D>0.0036 </D><D>0.00875 </D><D>0.01235 </D><D>8(9)/10000 </D><D>Proposed case with upper body absorption; feasible to monitor and maintain.</D><F/>a Based on one-stage version of Crump's multistage model and onthe assumption of 100% absorption through the G-I tract tissues of theNTP female mice; p-value of chi-squared goodness-of-fit test 1 0.25 (adequatefits show p 1 0.10). <F/>b 1.0 ppm=8.1 mg/m\3\; assumes 50% absorption through the lung (ata breathing rate of 1.2 m\3\/hr.) <F/>c I(a) andamp; (b) dermal-palms forearms and the rest of the upperbody.

The Committee recommendedthe establishment of stringent provisions regarding the use of personalprotective equipment to prevent dermal exposure to MDA; however, the Committeerecognized that in some cases total prevention might require the use of``full-body space suits''. The Committee recognized that such a requirementis impractical; workers cannot be expected to work under such conditions.The Committee believed that suitable gloves can be used to prevent absorptionthrough the palms (major route of exposure) and that aprons, coveralls,etc., can also prevent dermal contact in the body areas they cover. Nonetheless,the Committee recognized that some exposure may occur through depositionand subsequent absorption of MDA on the upper body, neck, etc., and assuch would recommend that consideration be given to these confounding factorswhen establishing levels of risk. The Committee's recommendations reflectan awareness of the increased risks associated with these dermal exposures.Adherence to permissible exposure limit, use of personal protective clothingand equipment, and the other standard provisions aid in preventing dermalexposure to the greatest extent feasible. B. OSHA's Findings OSHA agrees with the recommendations of the Committee and makes use ofthe Committee's assumptions in predicting expected risks resulting fromoccupational exposure to MDA. While OSHA has accepted the Committee's recommendationsregarding the use of the ``surface area correction factor'', OSHA notesthat this technique is used by many health agencies, such as EPA. Theseagencies have expressed their belief that this factor allows a more positivecorrelation between the dose/response noted in animals and that expectedin man. OSHA also recognizes that applying this factor to the risk estimatesgenerated by the Committee would result in estimates of excess risk ofdeath from a working lifetime exposure to MDA of 60-300 per 1,000. TheCommittee cautioned against the use of any of the risk estimates as definitiveindications of what can be expected in man. Rather, the Committee believedthat these are truly estimates or indications or what might be expected.OSHA agrees that risk estimates are only estimates and are not to be usedas definitive indications. Thus while OSHA has examined the benefits (seebelow) expected from implementation of the Committee's recommendations,OSHA has also examined the benefits expected if the surface area correctionfactor were employed. Thus, in some instances, benefits are examined asranges. <ITAG tagnum="84">V Significance of Risk </ITAG>A. Summary of the Committee's Recommendations The Committee did not specifically state that a significant risk existsfrom worker exposure to MDA. The Committee would only state that the riskestimates accepted by the Committee fit the framework applied by OSHA inmaking policy decisions leading to the determination of significant riskin previous rulemakings. The Committee s decision not to make a significanceof risk finding was due in part to the belief of some of the Committeemembers that such a finding is a legal conclusion based on scientific considerations.Furthermore, they contended that OSHA must make such a finding as a prerequisiteto promulgating a new standard under Section 6(b) of the Occupational Safetyand Health Act, interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in <T3>Industrial Union Department </T3>v. <T3>American Petroleum Institute</T3>, 448 U.S. 607 (1980). It must thenpublish its conclusions in the preamble to the standard <T3>OSHA </T3>proposes. Some Committee members believed that the Committee'smaking such a finding would constitute an improper transference of theAgency's obligation. While representatives from OSHA, EPA, and the State of California, acceptedthe decision of the majority of the Committee regarding the language proposedby the Committee for this section, they nonetheless were concerned withthe Committee's failure to state precisely that a significant risk existsat current MDA occupational exposures. These Committee members emphasizedthat at the current occupational levels MDA represents a significant risk.The preambular language recommended by the Committee for this significanceof risk section takes into consideration the sensitive nature of this particularrecommendation. In addition, the Committee was provided the policy andpast practices of OSHA regarding significant risk findings in other rulemakings.Thus, while the Committee did not specifically make a finding of significantrisk, the Committee did address the necessary evidence needed to make thisdetermination. It was for these reasons that the Committee recommendedthat a standard be established which reduced exposures to the lowest extentfeasible. B. OSHA's Findings OSHA previously made a preliminary finding of significant risk resultingfrom occupational exposure to MDA in responding to EPA's referral (51 FR6748). In making this determination, OSHA was guided by a number of factorsthat are consistent with recent court interpretations of the OSH Act andrationale, and policy formulation regarding significance of risk. As prescribedby Section 6(b)(5) of the OSH Act, the Agency examined the body of ``bestavailable evidence'' on the toxic effects of MDA to determine the natureand extent of possible health consequences resulting from workplace exposure.The quantitative risk assessment recommended by the Committee was usedwith other relevant information by OSHA to determine whether establishinga permissible exposure limit and other standard provisions would substantiallyreduce the risk. For guidance in determining whether regulatory activity would substantiallyreduce the risk, OSHA had followed some general guidance given to the Agencyby the Court for arriving at findings of the significance of an occupationalhealth risk. The Court stated as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">It is the Agency's responsibility to determine in the first instancewhat it considers to be a ``significant'' risk. Some risks are plainlyacceptable and others are plainly unacceptable. If, for example, the oddsare one in a billion that a person will die from cancer by taking a drinkof chlorinated water, the risk clearly could not be considered significant.On the other hand, if the odds are one in a thousand that regular inhalationof gasoline vapors that are 2% benzene will be fatal, a reasonable personmight well consider the risk significant and take appropriate steps todecrease or eliminate it (<T3>IUD </T3>v. <T3>API </T3>448 U.S. at 655).</ITAG>Although the Court's example is based on a quantitative expression of therisk, the Court indicated that the significant risk determination requiredof OSHA is not ``a mathematical straitjacket,'' and that ``OSHA is notrequired to support the finding that a significant risk exists with anythingapproaching scientific certainty.'' The Court ruled that ``a reviewingcourt [is] to give OSHA some leeway where its findings must be made onthe frontiers of scientific knowledge [and] * * * the Agency is free touse conservative assumptions in interpreting the data with respect to carcinogens,risking error on the side of overprotection rather than underprotection''(448 U.S. at 655, 656).OSHA largely bases its findings that a particular level of risk is ``significant''on policy considerations (<T3>IUD </T3>v. <T3>API, </T3>448 U.S. 655, 656, n.62). As part of the significant riskdetermination, OSHA examined a number of factors consistent with its policy(see Arsenic, 48 FR 1864, January 14, 1983; ethylene oxide, 48 FR 17284,April 21, 1983; formaldehyde, 52 FR 46167, December 4, 1987; and Asbestos(51 FR 22611, June 20, 1986)). These include the type of risk presented,the quality of the underlying data, the reasonableness of the risk assessments,and the statistical significance of risk. OSHA reviewed the toxicological and epidemiological literature and therecord evidence on MDA described in the Health Effects section. The record,as summarized herein, shows that MDA exposure is associated with a widerange of health effects. The NTP study indicates that MDA is carcinogenicin both rats and mice. The study appears to have been conducted in accordancewith good laboratory practices and is adequate for use as the basis forquantitative risk assessment. The Oak Ridge National Laboratories dataalso support the findings that MDA is a carcinogen in test animals. Theability of MDA to induce tumors in animals, suggestive evidence that MDAmay induce bladder tumors in humans, and data indicating that MDA interactswith genetic material lead to the conclusion that this chemical is an animalcarcinogen and is a possible carcinogen to humans. In animals, MDA has also been associated with genotoxicity, retinopathy,allergic dermatitis, and hepatotoxicity. In addition, human studies stronglyindicate that MDA causes a characteristic acute toxic hepatitis. The quantitative risk assessment, which is used to predict risk in manis based on animal studies by NTP. This correlation is achieved by relianceupon generally accepted health policies, which indicate that carcinogenicitydemonstrated by a chemical in mammalian species is sufficient to concludethat carcinogenicity is possible in humans. The fit of the experimentalcancer data to the model used in making the extrapolations is good andthe risk assumptions recommended by the Committee and accepted by OSHAare reasonable. Therefore, the resulting assessment appears appropriate.The preliminary preferred estimate of risk of death from a working lifetime exposure to MDA at the highest reported levels ranges from 6-30 per1,000 depending upon the amount of dermal absorption which is occurring.OSHA concludes that the present adoption of the Committee's recommendedstandard would substantially reduce the risks. These findings are consistentwith OSHA determinations or preliminary determinations from other rulemakings,such as: Inorganic arsenic (Jan. 14, 1983; 48 FR 1864, 1896) and ethyleneoxide (April 21, 1983; 48 FR 17284, 17295. Those estimates per 1,000 employeesfor a working life time exposure were 148-425 lung cancer deaths from inorganicarsenic; and 63-109 cancer deaths from ethylene oxide, based on the PEL'swhich applied prior to the completion of new lower standards. In evaluating significant risk a framework is provided by an examinationof occupational risk rates and legislative intent. For example, in thehigh risk occupations of fire fighting and mining and quarrying the averagerisk of death from an occupational injury or an acute occupationally relatedillness from a lifetime of employment (45 years) is 27.45 and 20.16 per1,000 employees respectively. Typical lifetime occupational risks of deathin occupations of moderate risk are 2.7 per 1,000 for all manufacturingand 1.62 per 1,000 for all service employment. Typical lifetime occupationalrisks of death in occupations of relatively low risk are 0.48 per 1,000in electric equipment and 0.07 per 1,000 in retail clothing. These ratesare derived from 1979 and 1980 Bureau of Labor Statistics data from employerswith 11 or more employees adjusted to 15 years of employment for 46 weeksper year. There are relatively few data on risk rates for occuparional cancer asdistinguished from occupational injury and acute illness. The estimatedcancer fatality rate from the maximum permissible occupational exposureto ionizing radiation is 17 to 29 per 1,000. (47 years at 5 rems; Committeeon the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) III predictions.)However, most radiation standards require that exposure limits be reducedto the lowest achievable exposure limit. Approximately 95% of radiationworkers have exposures less than one-tenth the maximum permitted level.This risk at one-tenth the permitted level is 1.7 to 2.9 per 1,000 exposedemployees. In considering all these findings, OSHA recognizes that the estimates ofrisk recommended by the Committee fit well within the range of other riskswhich OSHA has previously concluded are significant. These estimates arehigher than risks of fatality in occupations of average risk, and are substantiallyhigher than the examples presented by the Supreme Court (<T3>IUD </T3>v. <T3>API, Id.</T3>). The mathematical models used to predict estimates of occupational riskresulting from inhalation and dermal contact with MDA were generated fromdata (approximately 1983) collected by NIOSH, EPA, and CMA which indicatethat current exposures are in the range of 50 to 70 ppb (Scenarios I andII of Table 49). Hence, the estimates of lifetime risk resulting from occupationalexposure were estimated to be approximately 6-30 per 1,000. OSHA, likethe Committee, uses this actual exposure monitoring data rather than assumingthat current occupational exposures were in compliance with the ACGIH recommendedlimit of 100 ppb. Since the ACGIH limits are not mandatory and there isno existing PEL, relying on observed exposure values to predict risk isacceptable. While the Committee did rely on these data to develop its mathematicalmodels, the Committee used more recent data provided by ICF, Heiden Associates,and many of its own members to estimate benefits (Ex. 9). Thus baselineestimates of current exposures for the eleven industry sectors examinedrange from levels as low as 1 ppb to as high as 41 ppb. The Committee believedthat these new exposure estimates represent many but not all of the firmswith potential exposure to MDA and as such it was more appropriate to makeuse of these estimates in predicting benefits than the occupational exposuresused to develop the mathematical models. Based on the risk estimates, OSHA agrees with the Committee's recommendationthat the risk resulting from occupational exposure to MDA be reduced tothe extent feasible. It is for the reasons stated above that OSHA acceptsthe Committee's recommendations for a proposed standard for exposure toMDA. OSHA believes that the rationale offered by the Committee regardingsignificant risk supports the basic criteria which OSHA traditionally makesuse of in making these determinations. All that appears to be lacking fromthe Committee's recommendation is the actual statement ``occupational exposureto MDA constitutes a significant risk''. OSHA, in using the rationale recommendedby the Committee, now finds that occupational exposure to MDA poses a significantrisk of harm to workers.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Economic and Technological Feasibility</ITAG>A. General Industry<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Summary of the Committee's Recommendations</ITAG>a. <T3>Introduction.</T3> The Committee examined the following three regulatoryalternatives in the analysis: (1) A 20 ppb (0.160 mg/m \3\) PEL with a10 ppb action level, (2) a 10 ppb (0.08 mg/m \3\) PEL with a 5 ppb actionlevel, and (3) a 1 ppb (0.008 mg/m \3\) PEL with a 0.5 ppb action level.The technological feasibility of implementing a STEL was assumed to befeasible for any of the TWA/PEL alternative examined, in that, the samecontrols needed to reduce the TWA would also assure that the STEL is met.The Committee's preliminary findings are as follows:andbullet; It is technologically feasible for industry to comply with a 10ppb PEL by installing some readily available engineering controls and incorporatingsome new work practices. Although it may also be feasible for some industrysectors to achieve 1 ppb as an exposure level, that level is not feasiblefor major sectors of industry.andbullet; Lowering the PEL from the present levels to 10 ppb, the proposedPEL, in conjunction with other provisions of the standard, would resultin annualized compliance costs of approximately $8.2 million and save anestimated 1.8 production workers lives per year of exposure. In addition,compliance with the recommended standard will cost an estimated $0.6 millionand save an estimated 0.5 maintenance workers' lives per year of exposure.andbullet; The recommended standard is economically feasible for the sectorsstudied and will not significantly affect either the competitive structureor the long-term profitability of these sectors.andbullet; The recommended standard is economically feasible and will notresult in significant or differential impacts on small business establishmentscovered under the scope of the standard. andbullet; There are no nonregulatory alternatives that adequately protectmost workers from the adverse health effects associated with MDA exposure.A summary of the benefits and costs estimated by the Committee for therecommended PEL of 10 ppb and two other alternative PELs (20 ppb and 1ppb) is provided in Exhibit 10, OSHA's RIA. The remainder of this discussionsummarizes the analyses upon which these findings are based. b. <T3>Industry and Exposure Profiles. </T3>The Committee also estimated thatthere are eleven principal industry sectors (maintenance workers for eachsector have been separately identified for purposes of analysis) whereworkers are potentially exposed to MDA. These sectors are: (1) MDA Productionfor MDI Synthesis/MDA Sale and Import; (2) Reprocessing; (3) Filament Winding;(4) Potting and Encapsulation; (5) Molding/Bonding of Tools and SpecialtySmall Parts; (6) Wire Coating; (7) Coatings; (8) Intermediate for TGMDAand PACM-20 Production; (9) Polyurethane Curing; (10) Advanced CompositeMaterials Production: and (11) use of PMR-15 Pre-preg Materials. Further,the Committee asserted that there are also seven other industrial sectorswhere MDA was once used and may still be rarely found. These minor sectorsare: (1) Coatings (Polybismalimides) of Printed Circuit Boards and Fabricationof Airplane Parts; (2) Dyes and Pigments; (3) Quiana Yarn; (4) Intermediatefor Pharmaceuticals, Herbicides, etc.; (5) Rubber Processing; (6) Anti-Oxidants;and (7) Ketamine Production. The Committee's analysis concluded that MDA is made primarily to serveas an intermediate in the production of methylenediphenylisocyanate (MDI)and MDI is used in a wide variety of products. However, one to two percentof all MDA produced is sold for uses such as epoxy or polyurethane curing,or production of polyamides. In addition, some MDA is imported and usedto produce a crude MDI known as PAPI or used for other non-MDI uses suchas tetraglycidyl methylenedianiline (TDGMA) or PMR-15 manufacture. The Committee further concluded that there are six firms which produceMDA for MDI production, MDA for Sale, or which import MDA. MDA is manufacturedby 6 companies at 7 locations in four states. Dow Chemical Co. (LaPorte,Texas); BASF (Geismar, La); E.I. Dupont (Belle, WV); Mobay Chemical (NewMartinsville. WV and Baytown, TX); Rubicon Chemical (Geismar, La); andUniroyal Chemicals division of Avery (Naugtuck. Ct). Three of these companies,Mobay, Rubicon, and Dow, account for over 90% of the MDA production. Further,the Committee estimated that approximately 600 million pounds of MDA areproduced for MDI conversion, 4,474,000 are produced domestically for sale,and an additional 1.8 million pounds are imported. In addition, it is estimatedthat the percentage of MDA in the product made domestically ranges from40-70%, while the percentage in the imported product is approximately 98%.Uses of MDI are far reaching and include areas of construction, refrigeration,transportation, tank and pipe insulation, packaging, casting systems forsolid products, and systems for microcellular products. Consumer productsinclude polyurethane foams (rigid, and flexible), elastomers, coatings,thermoplastic resins, foundry core binders, adhesives and sealants, andspandex fibers. Thus, because MDA is the reactant chemical in the productionof MDI, the significance of and the need for MDA depends upon the needto produce MDI. However, since there are so many products containing MDIand the extent of MDI use is increasing, it can be assumed that MDA usewill also continue to increase. In addition, the non-MDI uses of MDA (2%of total MDA consumption) are also expected to increase as product demandin the areas of nuclear energy, weapons manufacture, and space explorationincreases. The Committee further estimated that the number of exposed production workersis 3,836 in the eleven principal industry sectors and an additional 189maintenance workers are also exposed in these sectors. The average weightedexposure levels ranged from 1 ppb in PMR-15 use to 19 ppb in Filament Winding.For maintenance workers the estimated average exposure level is 250 ppb.The average days of MDA exposure per year ranged from 47 for Advanced CompositeManufacture to 250 for production and some of the other sectors. c. <T3>Benefit Analysis. </T3>The major benefit of the proposed standard wouldbe a reduction in the occurrence of occupational illnesses. Some aspectsof these benefits can be quantified, such as the reduced risk of cancerdue to direct exposure to MDA. The number of cancer cases that would beprevented because of the proposed MDA regulation is based on the the Committee'srecommended model for quantitative assessment of the risk of cancer, resultingtrom occupational exposure to MDA. The model is based on ``realistic worst-case''assumptions; yet, in some respects, the use of the model also tends tounderestimate the true benefits of the proposed regulation, because theonly benefits quantified in the analysis are those resulting from a reducedincidence of cancer. They do not include an estimate of the reduction inthe incidence of other adverse health impacts potentially associated withMDA exposure such as liver disease. Because of data limitations, the Committeecould not quantify these additional benefits, but expects that they willbe substantial.Based on the methodology detailed in Chapter III of the Committee's recommendation,the Committee estimated the excess cancer cases that are expected to occuramong MDA-exposed workers in the eleven principal industry sectors describedabove. Estimates of risk are based on both airborne and dermal exposureto MDA. Based on current MDA exposure levels, the Committee estimates thatby lowering the PEL to 10 ppb and implementing other components of thestandard, the number of excess deaths would be reduced by 1.8 for eachyear of exposure. These estimates apply to production workers only; anadditional 0.5 excess cancer deaths would be avoided each year among maintenanceworkers as a result of the standard. Promulgating the proposed rule witha 10 ppb PEL would result in a total of 2.3 cases of cancer averted eachyear. The analysis indicates that most of the potential risk results fromdermal exposure.In addition to the lives saved as a result of reduced MDA exposure levels,the Committee expects the medical surveillance provisions to further reducethe number of excess deaths. Workers exposed to MDA often exhibit earlysigns of liver disease that can be detected by a proper medical examination.Better control of the MDA exposures of these workers would, at least insome cases, provide an opportunity to observe the abnormalities prior tothe development of potentially fatal disease. d. <T3>Technological Feasibility. </T3>The Committee has determined that therecommended standard is technologically feasible. The methods that canbe used to reduce employee exposure to MDA include conventional technologiessuch as general and local exhaust ventilation, pneumatic feed systems,and glove boxes. Such technologies are commonly known and currently usedin the affected industries. In addition, provisions of the recommendedstandard that are not related to the PEL, such as medical surveillanceand raining, are judged to be feasible. e. <T3>Costs of Compliance. </T3>The Committee made estimates of the compliancecosts that would be incurred by employers in the eleven principal industrysectors which handle MDA and would be primarily affected by the recommendedstandard. Because there are industry-specific differences in exposure characteristicsand equipment usage, cost estimates for each sector were developed separately.A baseline of current industry practice was identified for each sector.This baseline was derived from information on current production methods,exposure levels, and hazard control techniques obtained from informationsupplied to the Committee. The costs of the controls which would be neededto achieve each successively lower PEL Were then estimated based on theassumption that new controls could be added to those controls already inplace. It should be noted that the lower the target PELs, the higher the uncertaintyassociated with estimates of the effectiveness of control technology andhousekeeping practices and their related costs. The Committee is confidentthat a 10 ppb PEL can generally be reached and maintained on an 8-hourTWA basis but is unsure that all industry sectors could generally achievea 1 ppb PEL.The Committee has estimated the following total annualized compliance cost(for production workers) as $8.2 million for the 10 ppb permissible exposurelimit. The major component of the estimated costs for production workersare the costs of hygiene facilities and practices, which constitute approximately50% of the total estimated costs for the 10 ppb PEL. The second major elementof cost is for protective clothing and equipment, which is approximately30% of the total cost of compliance of achieving the 10 ppb PEL. Housekeepingcosts constitute approximately 10% of the total estimated costs. The estimatedcosts of engineering controls constitute only a small percentage (4%) ofthe total estimated annualized costs of compliance for production workers.f. <T3>Economic Feasibility Analysis. </T3>The Committee acquired a substantialamount of data regarding compliance technologies in the course of its feasibilityanalysis. While this material was extremely useful for the Agency's technologicalfeasibility and compliance cost analysis, it was not sufficient to supportdetailed, rigorous economic and regulatory flexibility analysis. None ofthe submissions, for example, presented data on the profitability of specificproduct lines, and detailed financial and economic data were availablefor only a few firms which produce or use MDA. The Committee thereforerelied heavily on the material gathered by both Heiden Associates, employedby CMA, and ICF, employed by OSHA, to perform a preliminary analysis ofthe economic impact of the recommended proposal at the industry sectorlevel, under a set of simplified assumptions about the economic and financialconditions of the MDA industries.A substantial amount of information is needed to analyze the economic impactsdescribed above. Not all of it could be developed given the scope and resourcesof the Committee's investigation. However, in previous work, ICF has investigatedthe costs of substitute chemicals for MDA in many of its broadly defineduses. In addition, a subcontractor for ICF gathered information on substitutecosts from individual firms during their site visits. While conductingthese visits, this subcontractor also collected some information on currentcosts of the production activities that use MDA. Finally, ICF has collectedand developed some general economic information on the affected industriesand the markets of their products and a small number of firms in the MDAindustry. Using these data, the Committee has been able to examine theeconomic effects of the regulations in terms of potential price increases,employment and output effects, and impacts on firms' profitability.The overall conclusions reached in the Committee's economic impact assessmentare: (1) Most, if not all, of the affected industries ought to be ableto pass the regulation's costs through to product purchasers (because ofmarket and other considerations described below); (2) to the extent thatoutput good prices rise in the process of passing these costs through toproduct purchasers, these price increases are not likely to be very largerelative to the pre-regulation prices of the products; and (3) to the extentthat prices of products do not rise (so that pass-through of these regulatorycosts to product purchasers does not occur), the regulatory costs are notlarge relative to the other production costs and the net incomes of thecompanies examined. Consequently, the Committee has concluded that theproposed regulations will not pose a substantial burden to the affectedindustries, their employees, or consumers of their products. Hence, the Committee's conclusion is that it is economically feasible forthe eleven principal industry sectors to comply with the provisions ofthe recommended MDA standard and that none of the sectors studied by theCommittee would experience significant economic impacts. g. <T3>Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. </T3>Pursuant to the Regulatory FlexibilityAct of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-353, 94 Stat. 1164 (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Committee has given special consideration to themitigation of the economic impacts of the recommended standard on smallentities. The Committee does not anticipate that the recommended standardwould adversely affect small entities. In developing a recommended standard for occupational exposure to MDA,the Committee carefully considered size factors such as number of employees,total assets, and gross revenues to ensure that the proposed standard wouldminimize the impact on small firms while continuing to protect workers.Furthermore, the Committee determined in the economic feasibility analysisthat most, if not all, of the affected industries would be able to passthe regulatory costs through to product purchasers reasonably rapidly.Thus, most of the affected firms probably will not have to bear all ofthe compliance costs for these regulations. Finally, the Committee examined the financial conditions of a sample offirms affected by the regulations and determined that even if these firmswere to bear the compliance costs of the regulations, these would not imposesubstantial burdens for these firms. Therefore, the Committee's conclusionis that the proposed regulation will not significantly affect small entities.h. <T3>Assessment of Nonregulatory Alternatives. </T3>The Committee believesthat there are no nonregulatory alternatives that would adequately protectmost workers from the adverse health effects associated with MDA exposure.The tort liability and Workers' Compensation systems do not provide adequateworker protection due to their unpredictability and inconsistency fromstate to state. Other government regulations do not provide adequate workerprotection due to their limited scope. OSHA does not have a current workplacestandard for occupational exposure to MDA; thus, no regulatory protectionis currently being provided.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Many employers offer voluntary protection e.g. personalprotective equipment, showers, change rooms, etc.</ITAG>i. <T3>Cost-Effectiveness of Regulatory Alternatives. </T3>The available scientificevidence demonstrates that MDA exposures can pose a hazard in the workplace.The Committee believes that this hazard can be significantly reduced throughthe implementation of the 10 ppb PEL. The Committee further believes thatthis PEL is obtainable and that it is feasible. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. OSHA's Findings </ITAG>OSHA reviewed the Committee's recommendations regarding the economic andtechnological feasibility in general industry of complying with the PELof 10 ppb proposed by the Committee and the accompanying standard provisionsand believes that the 10 ppb PEL the 100 ppb STEL, and the accompanyingstandard provisions will substantially reduce the risk to worker health,and it is feasible. Included in the Committee's recommendations for economic and technologicalfeasibility are also recommendations for examining the benefits expectedfrom implementation of the Committee's recommendations. The Committee'sbenefit analysis reflect the number of lives saved which would occur ifthe Committee's recommended standards were implemented. OSHA recognizesthat in calculating the benefits expected that the Committee relied uponthe risk determinations which were made. OSHA further recognizes that themethodology used by the Committee does not propose the use of the surfacearea correction factor in making risk calculations. While OSHA did adoptthe Committee's risk methodology, OSHA is cognizant of the impact thatapplication of the surface area correction factor has on the risk estimatesand subsequent benefits. In fact, OSHA acknowledges that application ofthe correction factor results in risk estimates of one order of magnitudegreater. When applying this factor, the excess cancers averted are escalatedfrom 1.8 to 18 per year of MDA exposure at the 10 ppb PEL.OSHA is also cognizant of the fact that many regulatory agencies, suchas EPA, recommend using the surface area correction factor because, itis the opinion of these groups, that application of this factor makes thecorrelation between dose in animal and dose in man more precise. Many groups,including the Committee, have stressed the importance of acknowledgingthe lack of certainty expressed by estimates of risk. Clearly, these estimatesare just estimates and should not be relied upon as definitive indicationsof the risk anticipated from occupational exposure to MDA. OSHA is guidedby the Committee's recommendations in this instance and believes that benefitsshould be derived using the range of risk expected from applying and notapplying the surface area correction factor. The result of OSHA's positionis that the benefits from implementing a 10 ppb PEL and the associatedduty provisions could result in as few as 1.6 to as high as 18 cancersaverted per year of exposure. B. Construction Industry <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Summary of the Committee's Recommendations </ITAG>a. <T3>Industry Profile. </T3>For the purposes of estimating costs, risks,and benefits, the Committee made a number of reasonable assumptions inorder to estimate the number of potentially exposed employees. These assumptionsare based on the amount of MDA which reportedly goes into paints and coatings,the rate (lbs/hr) of paint application under spray and roll-on conditions,and the average hours of work of a typical painter. Assuming that 200,000lbs of MDA are used yearly in coatings \1\<NOTE/>, and that it constitutes 20% by weight of the final product,the Committee estimated that one million pounds of MDA containing coatingsare applied each year. Estimates provided to the Committee by the InternationalBrotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades suggest that the average applicationrate of spray methods is 20 lbs/hr, while that for the roll-on methodsis 30 lbs/hr. The Committee combined these estimates with the assumptionthat a typical painter spends only four hours/day painting,\2\<NOTE/> with the rest of the time taken up by preparation, set-upand clean up of work areas. The Committee further assumed, in the absenceof any available data, that a typical painter would spend only 10% of hiswork time (25 days) each year using MDA-containing coatings.\3\<NOTE/> The result of these assumptions is that a typical painterwould spend some 100 hours/year applying MDA coatings. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ ICF, Inc. provided this estimate for OSHA in its preliminarytechnological and economic analysis. Thus the Committee made use of the200,000 lbs. per year figure in its computations. The International Brotherhoodof Painters and Allied Trades provided the estimate that the paint wascomposed of 20% MDA and 80% other products. (Ex. 9) <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The number of hours per day engaged in painting operationswas furnished by Research Triangle Institute in a document prepared forOSHA in 1980 entitled ``Economic Impact Statement for Abrasive Blasting''.(Ex. 9) <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Estimated from discussions with representatives of theInternational Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades. Since approximately1 million pounds of this are MDA coatings, the Committee conservativelyestimated that MDA containing coatings are approximately 10% of the appliedcoatings and should require 10% of the workers time to be applied. (Ex.9) For spray applications, each painter would thus apply 2000 lbs/yr; andfor roll-on application, 3000 lbs/yr.\4\<NOTE/> Since an estimated 400,000 lbs of MDA paint are consumedeach year in spray operations and 600,000 lbs in roll-on operations, thesum of these assumptions yields an estimate of 200 potentially exposedworkers (400,000 lbs/yr divided by 2000 lbs/worker year) in spray operationsand 200 workers (600,000 lbs/year divided by 3000 lbs/worker year) in roll-onapplications. These estimates are obviously tenuous, but the Committeeconsidered them a reasonable basis to estimate costs, risks, and benefits.The Committee believed that both spray and roll on application methodsentail risk of airborne and dermal exposure. Spray applications, in theview of the Committee, are especially likely to pose potentially serioushazards. In addition, the Committee is aware of two reported cases involvingacute hepatitis after application of MDA-containing coating products, andsources in the scientific literature and at least one trade union havereported that skin problems are common among painters using epoxy paints.The latter reports confirm the common occurrence of dermal exposures, andthus the potential for skin absorption of MDA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The estimate of 2000 lbs/yr for spray painters and 3000lbs/yr for roll-on application came from the discussions with the InternationalBrotherhood of Painters representative. (Ex. 9)For the purpose of risk estimation in spray operations, the Committee assumedthat TWA airborne levels of exposure to MDA could reasonably be estimatedto be similar to those experienced by maintenance workers, 250 ppb (2 mg/m\3\). Dermal exposure levels were also assumed to be 0.50 mg/cm \2\-hrfor the palms and 0.00134 mg/cm \2\-hr for the forearms and upper body\5\<NOTE/>. These are twice that expected for maintenance workers. TheCommittee believed that the spray applications presented twice the potentialfor skin deposition and absorption as would be expected for maintenanceworkers. For manual roll-on applications, it is reasonable to assume lowerlevels of both airborne and dermal exposures. The Committee estimated thatairborne and dermal exposures would be comparable to those estimated forthe polyurethane curing sector, or 0.160 mg/m \3\ (airborne), 0.25 mg/cm\2\-hr for the palms, and 0.00067 mg/cm \2\-hr for the forearms and upperbody \5\. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The Committee estimated that exposures for spray applicationswould be roughly twice that of maintenance operations. The Committee didattempt to substantiate these assumptions by making comparable comparisons.A spray painting evaluation by NIOSH provided the comparison. Comparablesindicate that paint mist concentrations ranged from 2.0-43.3 mg/m \3\.Assuming 20% MDA by weight, then the mist would range from 0.4-8.7 mg/m\3\ respirable MDA. The Committee's estimates that 0.160 mg/m \3\ of MDAwould be respirable for roll-on applications and that 2 mg/m \3\ wouldbe respirable for spray applications appear to be conservative and perhapsunderestimates the true worker exposures but the Committee's assumptionsare reasonable. (Ex. 9) The Committee has estimated that 400 workers are exposed to MDA-containingpaints and coatings, 200 in spray applications and 200 in roll-on applications.Based on the limited data available, an average of 6 painters per employeror firm was assumed. The total number of potentially affected firms wouldthus be approximately 66 (400 workers/6 workers per firm). Spray applicationswere assumed to entail higher exposure, both airborne and dermally, thanroll-on applications. Data describing exposure levels, number of employers,or number of employees were not available to the Committee, so that theexposure profiles were constructed with the use of reasonable assumptions.b. <T3>Benefits. </T3>In this section, the Committee estimated the potentialbenefits (in terms of deaths avoided) accruing as a result of its recommendationsfor a proposed standard for the Construction Industry. The analysis ofthis section demonstrates that as a result of the recommendations beingmade by the Committee, approximately .042 painters applying MDA containingcoatings through spray applications and .019 painters applying MDA containingcoatings through roll-on applications will be saved for every year of reducedexposure by establishing a permissible exposure limit of 10 ppb and reducingto the extent feasible dermal absorption of MDA. A significant proportionof the estimated lives saved are the result of the reduction in dermalexposure, whereas the reduction in airborne exposure levels makes a muchsmaller contribution to the reduction in risk. While the Committee was able to estimate the benefits from reducing therisks due to occupational cancer, it was unable to quantify the effectsthat the recommended standard provisions would have on reducing other occupationalrisks resulting from MDA exposure (e.g., reduced incidence of dermatitis,liver toxicity, etc.). c. <T3>Technological Feasibility. </T3>This section assesses the technologicalfeasibility of achieving the alternative levels. The Committee has reviewedthe technological feasibility and believes that while it may be feasibleand necessary in some instances to use local (or general exhaust ventilation)to reduce exposures, these controls alone will not provide adequate protectionfor painters (applying coatings through spray application). These controlsin conjunction with the use of respiratory protection will be necessaryto ensure that workers applying paints through a spray technique are adequatelyprotected. In many instances, the Committee believes that it will not befeasible to use local or general exhaust ventilation, and in these casesonly respiratory protection will be used. The Committee recognizes thatmany coating applications in the Construction Industry will be to concretestructures, pipes, flooring, etc. These surfaces may be located insideor outside of buildings but are usually outdoors. It is often times difficultto use traditional control technologies in these instances. However, theCommittee acknowledges that some of these construction activities may beconducted inside of facilities or perhaps in confined spaces (e.g., tanks,pipes). In these instances, the Committee expects that employers will providethe usual and necessary engineering controls in addition to the necessaryrespiratory protection. The Committee also recognizes that the use of engineeringcontrols in these instances is mandated by existing OSHA regulations (e.g.confined spaces, spray painting). For purposes of feasibility, the Committee believes that compliance willbe achieved primarily through the use of the appropriate respiratory equipmentand not through the use of engineering controls. The Committee made theserecommendations based on its findings that in the construction sector MDAappears to be used exclusively in coating application. No other use wasidentified. While workers applying coatings through roll-on techniqueswere not expected to need respirators, those engaged in spray applicationwould be required to use a respirator. Based on the analysis discussed above, the Committee recommended that thefollowing preliminary determination of feasibility in these sectors beused by OSHA: andbullet; It is technologically feasible for the painters applying MDA-containingcoatings to achieve compliance with a PEL of 10 ppb or less through theuse of the appropriate respiratory protective equipment. andbullet; It is also considered feasible to eliminate dermal exposure bythe use of appropriate personal protective equipment and clothing. d. <T3>Costs of Compliance. </T3>This discussion presents estimates of thecompliance costs that would be incurred by employers in the ConstructionIndustry subsequent to the promulgation of a PEL of 10 parts per billion(0.08 mg/m \3\), with an action level of 5 parts per billion. The costto achieve this PEL would be the result of the use of personal protectiveequipment, hygiene measures, education, and other measures. The costs ofengineering controls are not included in the analysis, since such controlswould only occasionally be implemented. The total estimated cost of complianceis $355,428/year for the entire sector to achieve compliance with any ofthe PELs whether it be 1, 10, or 20 ppb. e. <T3>Economic Feasibility and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. </T3>In accordancewith Executive Order No. 12991 (46 FR 13193, February 19, 1981), OSHA hasassessed the potential economic impacts of the proposed MDA standard. Thepreliminary determination is that the regulatory requirement limiting MDAexposure in the workplace, including PEL levels reduced to 10 ppb, wouldnot result in significant adverse economic impact on any of the industrysectors for which detailed financial and compliance data are available.Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-353, 94Stat. 1164 (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>)), consideration has been given to the mitigation of theeconomic impacts of the proposed standard on small entities. Based on theavailable data, it is not anticipated that the proposed standard wouldsignificantly affect a substantial number of small entities. The proposed regulations limiting exposure to MDA in the construction industryaffects workers in approximately 66 firms. The Committee has conducteda preliminary assessment of the economic impact likely to be experiencedby these 66 affected firms and has determined that these are likely tobe minimal based on the nature of the applications involved and the probabilitythat these compliance costs will be passed through to the purchasers oftheir services. The supporting analysis for this finding is presented below,and is based on the same methodology for determining economic impacts usedto assess the impact of the proposed regulations on the producers and primaryusers of MDA. The annualized compliance costs faced by the affected construction firmswill be approximately $5,450. Several factors suggest that these costswill be passed through to the purchasers of the services of these constructionfirms. Approximately 90% of these costs are variable compliance costs,which implies that if these costs can be passed through to the purchasersof the services of these firms, they will be passed through relativelyrapidly. A second and perhaps more important reason why these compliancecosts will probably be passed through to the purchasers of these firms'services is that the purchasers are large firms and government entitiesmanaging large projects (e.g., chemical plants, reactors, and defense-relatedactivities). As such, the incremental costs associated with limiting workerexposure to MDA are likely to be extremely small relative to the economicsize of these projects. Furthermore, in many cases, contractual and engineeringspecifications may require that the MDA-related products be used for theirdesirable physical properties. In these cases, the incremental compliancecost will certainly be passed through to these purchasers. Given theseconsiderations, it is likely that these compliance costs will be fullypassed through in a relatively short period of time. If these compliance costs are passed through to purchasers of these firms'services, the increase in the price of these services is likely to be extremelysmall. First, the annual compliance costs are quite low per firm, and constitutean even smaller portion of the costs of the activities of these firms.That is, compliance costs of several thousand dollars per year are quitelow when compared to these firms' labor costs_on the order of tens of thousandsof dollars per year per worker_and relative to the total costs of the constructionservices provided. Thus, it is unlikely that the price increase that mayresult from the proposed regulations will be large, so that plant closuresor employment contractions will result. Finally, if the compliance costs are not passed through to the purchasersof the services of these affected firms, given the size of the incrementalcosts, it is highly unlikely that these costs would pose a significantburden to the firms involved. Relative to the workers and other costs ofconstruction activities affected by the proposed regulations, the incrementalcompliance costs of $5,450 per firm are extremely small. Thus, it is unlikelythat any significant economic impact will arise from the proposed regulationseven if the compliance costs are not passed through to the purchasers ofthese firms' services. Based on these considerations the Committee concluded that the proposedregulations will not cause significant economic impacts to the affectedconstruction firms because the compliance costs are small relative to theeconomic size of the affected firms and the activities into which theseconstruction services are inputs.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. OSHA's Findings </ITAG>OSHA reviewed the Committee's recommendations regarding the economic andtechnological feasibility of construction industry compliance with theproposed PELs and the accompanying standard provisions and believes thatcompliance is feasible.In general, the Committee recommended in these feasibility findings thatconstruction employers could implement engineering and work practice controlsto the extent feasible, to achieve the PELs. Yet, while favoring this traditionalhierarchy of control, the Committee did conclude that: ``while it may befeasible in some instance to use local exhaust or general exhaust ventilationto reduce exposures, these controls alone will not provide adequate protectionfor painters'' (FR 26849). Thus, for purposes of estimating costs and selectingcontrol technology, the Committee assumed in its feasibility findings thatcompliance for workers engaged in application of paint through spray techniqueswould be achieved through the use of an air-supplied respirator. OSHA, like the Committee, is also cognizant of the fact that coating applicationin the construction sector often involved the application of surface coatingsto large concrete structures, (e.g., nuclear power plants) and that inthese instances the traditional engineering controls which would applyto spray painters in spray booths or rooms might not be feasible and itmight become necessary to reduce worker exposure to MDA through respiratoryusage. On the other hand, in those instances where engineering controlswere not feasible for workers actually engaged in the spray applicationprocess, engineering controls such as isolation would be necessary to protectworkers on neighboring work sites. OSHA, like the Committee, also recognizesthat worker protection might freguently rely solely on work practices whichin turn rely very heavily on worker participation in order to be effective;in these instances respirator use would serve as a back up for work practicefailures. OSHA further recognized that the Committee's recommendationswere made primarily from a concern with ingestion and absorption of MDA,since the available data suggest that blindness had resulted from ingestionas well as cancer and hepatitis from absorption, and a realization by OSHAthat coating applicators are potentially exposed to very high concentrationsof MDA in the paint mists. It appeared more protective to require the useof respirators for coating applicators in addition to feasible engineeringand work practice controls and thus the Committee's feasibility determinationsassumed that compliance with the PELs would be achieved primarily throughthe use of a respirator in this limited instance. Thus, OSHA recognizes that although the Committee favors the hierachy ofcontrols requiring engineering and work practice controls, the Committeebelieved that in the construction sector, where MDA was applied as surfacecoatings, feasible engineering controls and work practices might not besufficient to provide adequate protection and that these controls in conjunctionwith the proper respirator and personal protective equipment are necessaryto assure that workers engaged in spray painting operations are protected.In addition, it is relevant to note that the Committee was unable to identifyany use of MDA in construction except for coating application through spraytechniques or roll-on application in non-barriered areas. Based on theCommittee's recommendation for general industry, OSHA can assume that forother construction uses that the traditional hierachy for control wouldapply. Before concluding that the Committee's recommendations for feasibilityfor construction were appropriate, OSHA examined its existing rules todetermine if spray painters applying paints to non-barriered surfaces wererequired by existing regulations to rely exclusively on engineering controlsand work practices rather than an air-supplied respirator to achieve compliance.OSHA's purpose was to establish ``baseline'' data reflective of currentfeasibility practices. While OSHA does have a general industry standardfor spray finishing operations found in andSection; 1910.94(c), this standardapplies to the automatic, manual, or electrostatic deposition of coatingsin enclosed or confined spaces. This section, however, delineates performanceorientated ventilation requirements to achieve the PELs found in andSection;1910.1000 as well as respirator requirements. Thus MDA, used as coatings,in any of these processes, would fall under the traditional hierarchy ofcontrol strategies. These standards, however are not applicable to roll-onapplication nor spray operations which are not confined by barriers. OSHAbelieves that the Committee was correct in assuming that coating applicationsin barriered or confined areas other than would be regulated by existingstandards and traditional control strategies applied. Furthermore, it isclear that non-barriered spray operations and roll-on applications arenot covered by existing standards which require engineering controls andwork practices such as those recommended by the Committee and now proposedby OSHA.OSHA, like the Committee, was unable to identify any existing regulationswhich would require the use of engineering controls and work practices,or respirators for that matter in these application processes. Since existing regulations did not appear to cover this select group ofexposed workers, OSHA sought further guidance in the appropriateness ofthe Committee's feasibility determinations. OSHA recognizes as did theCommittee that spray application is a unique and very specific work situation.Basically, it involves the application of MDA coatings to the exteriorsurfaces of large structures, application is primarily through traditionalspray applications, and workers are potentially exposed to extremely highconcentrations of paint mists which include MDA along with other contaminants.It is often times difficult to perform monitoring and in fact breathingzone samples of paint mists are monitored and calculations of per centsby weight of substances contained in the paints are often times used toestimate individual contaminants, such as MDA. A recent NIOSH publication``An Evaluation Of Engineering Control Technology For Spray Painting''provided the necessary technical information which OSHA needed to makeits findings on the Committee's recommendations. This document gave severalrecommendations for protecting workers engaged in spray operations. Theserecommendations and OSHA s conclusions regarding these findings can befound below. First, the document found that the level of airborne paint mist is a morereliable indicator of the degree of control in manual spray finishing thanthe concentration of solvent vapors. Solvent concentrations were well belowthe recommended maximums even when paint mist levels exceeded the maximumconcentration permitted for nuisance dusts. If the paint     compositionis known, the concentration of paint mist can also  be used as a guidein estimating the potential exposure to  specific non-volatile paint components.For example, if the  concentration of paint mist is 5 mg/m\3\, and leadrepresents 1  percent by weight of the paint solids, then the airborne concentration of lead could be estimated at 50 ug/m\3\.  Thus this document confirmed that the technique of using  percent by weightsto estimate contaminants was the current  state of the art. OSHA was furtherguided by the statement  found in this document which states; ``Presentanalytical  techniques do not permit the evaluation of the presence of these amines in a curing agent/paint aerosol.'' It appears that  the percentby weight approach would be necessary in this  unique situation. Giventhe uncertainity of this monitoring  approach, it seems more appropriateto select a respirator  which will protect against paint mists generally,rather than  any one chemical specifically. This is what the Committee recommended.  Second, the report found that application methods are  assumed to be keyto reducing exposure. Where feasible,  airless techniques are recommendedover the more conventional  spray guns; monitoring data indicate that paintmist  concentrations where airless methods are used are approximately    10 times less than those using the conventional methods. NIOSH  concludesin this document that in many operations, ventilation  is impractical,and efficient application techniques are the  only logical choice. Therecommendation is that application  equipment should be selected that minimizesthe energy expended  in the atomization process, thus reducing the amountof stray  mist that is generated.  While OSHA agrees that airless methods and roll-on  application shouldbe used whenever feasible, OSHA believes as  did the Committee that theprimary use for coatings in the  construction sector involves the traditionalmethod of spray  application. The NIOSH document indicates that less paintis  also lost through these techniques and OSHA believes that this  willbe an additional incentive to use these preferred  techniques when feasible.OSHA believes as did the Committee  that a respirator is still necessaryfor painters applying MDA  coatings and using airless techniques.  Third, the study also recommends that respiratory  protection be requiredin those spray finishing operations that  employ significant quantititesof highly toxic materials, such  as lead, chromium, or reactive compounds(MDA). Respiratory  protection is also necessary against paint mist andorganic  solvents in painting enclosed spaces or other areas where  ventilationis compromised.  OSHA finds this recommendation to be consistent with those  made by theCommittee and believes that a properly selected and     functioning respiratoralong with feasible engineering controls  is necessary to protect workersfrom the hazards posed by  coating application.  Fourth, the report recommends that a conventional half  facepiece respirator,with mist-removing prefilters and organic  vapor-removing cartridges, shouldprovide adequate respiratory  protection in cases where the hazards canbe identified and  quantified. In many instances, the variety of paintsemployed  on a given workshift make quantification of the hazard  impractical.In other cases, painting may be done in an  enclosed area. These situationswarrant the use of a  supplied-air respirator.  OSHA finds this recommendation consistent with those made  by the Committeeand notes that the Committee's feasibility  determinations for workersengaged in spray application  included the use of an air-supplied respirator. Fifth, the report notes that many paint constituents can be  injuriousto the eyes and the skin as well as to the  respiratory system. Full facepieceor hood-type respirators  are recommended where these consitituents arepresent. In  addition, the full facepiece is more comfortable than a  half-maskbecause the pressure of the attaching straps is  distributed over a largerfacial area and no goggles are  required to protect the eyes.  The recommendations made by the Committee closely parallel  those madeby NIOSH. Applicable engineering controls along     with the appropriaterespirator and personal protective  equipment must be worn by workers engagedin spray painting  applications in the construction sector. OSHA further recognizes, as did the Committee, that for the most part the  only feasiblecontrol which will protect the worker from his  work place environment,in this instance, may be only a  respirator. In making this finding, OSHAis not deviating from  its traditional approach to achieving control through recognized and accepted strategies, nor is OSHA not requiring  the applicationor use of engineering controls in feasible  situations. Clearly, OSHA alreadyhas standards which require  the use of such controls in confined or enclosedspaces.  Rather, OSHA is recognizing, as did the Committee that the use of MDA in spray painting operations in the construction sector  (mostlyinvolve painting of large structures e.g. nuclear  power plants) representsa unique work situation and that  feasibility findings for spray applicationcan only be made if  reliance is given to the use of the appropriate respirator, supplemented with engineering and work practice controls were  feasible.OSHA believes that as a result of these feasibility  findings the standardprovisions now being proposed will  provide adequate protection for workersengaged in spray  operations regardless of the constitution of the paintbeing  used. In addition, OSHA as did the Committee would require  adherenceto traditional control strategies for employers  engaged in activitiesin operations involving work situations  other than the application ofMDA through spray techniques. OSHA recognizes that the Committee assumed that no engineering controlswould be used by painters engaged in the spray application of MDA in theconstruction sector, thus no costs for engineering controls were computed.Hence, the Committee's feasibility determinations were based on the assumptionthat respirators would be the sole means of protection, aside from personalprotective clothing in this sector. Since the Committee recognized respiratorsas the only feasible method of control, OSHA solicits comments on the appropriatenessof allowing spray painters to rely solely on the use of respirators ratherthan also requiring engineering controls and work practices in this uniquesituation to achieve the PELs for workers engaged in spray applicationtechniques. OSHA also requests comments on whether or not MDA is used elsewherein the construction sector, and, if so, what control techniques are currentlybeing used, and whether it is feasible to achieve the proposed PELS byexclusive reliance on engineering controls and work practices or whetherrespirators are the only feasible control. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Summary and Explanation of the Standard for General Industry</ITAG>A. Committee's Recommendations <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (a). Scope and Application </ITAG>(a)(1) The Committee's recommended general industry standard would applyto all ``oocupational exposures'' to MDA with the specific exceptions setforth in the scope and application section and would apply to all workplacesin all industries, except for construction, where MDA is produced, released,stored, handled, used, or transported, and over which OSHA has jurisdiction.The Committee developed a separate recommended standard for the constructionindustry. The two standards, general industry and construction, would,however, cover all industries covered by the Act. The general industrystandard covers all activities and operations including ship repair andrebuilding, manufacturing, secondary processing, and downstream use ofMDA. Employees of the Construction Industry are covered by the constructionstandard. Construction activities are defined in 29 CFR 1910.12(b) as workfor construction, alteration and/or repair, including painting and decorating.As noted above, ship repair and shipbreaking activities are covered bythe general industry standard. The Committee believes the provisions ofthe general industry standard are appropriate for the operations involvingMDA which will occur on ships. (a)(2) This paragraph contains exclusions for workplaces that process,handle, or use products containing MDA where initial monitoring data showthat the product cannot release MDA at or above the action level and wherethe likelihood for dermal exposure does not exist. The criterion for exemptionunder paragraph (a)(2) requires monitoring data that show that the materialis incapable of releasing airborne MDA at or above the action level underthe expected conditions of processing, handling or use, and the likelihoodof dermal exposure does nor exist. The Committee recognized that in some segments and operations, exposuresare below the action level and do not result in dermal exposure becauseof the nature of the process or use. In those circumstances, the Committeehas proposed an exemption from the proposed MDA standard. In general, theCommittee agreed that because of the low vapor pressure of MDA, the inhalationpotential is minimal provided the substance is not heated. However, theCommittee would only recommend this exclusion provided that dermal exposurewas not likely. Further, the Committee believed that continued monitoringfor many operations, where the evidence clearly demonstrates that exposureswill be consistently below the action level and where dermal exposure doesnot exist, does not appear to be necessary to protect employees, nor doesit appear to be cost-effective. Moreover, the Committee noted that therecommended proposed rule has been structured so that any compliance burdenimposed by the standard is related to the extent and duration of the employees'exposure in the employer's workplace. The Committee agreed, however, thatin order to be exempt from these provisions the employer must monitor tomake this determination. The Committee did not feel that the employer shouldrely on data generated by manufacturers and believed to be applicable todownstream users. The Committee did, however, agree to allow the employer to demonstratethat its employee exposures are below the action level by using historicalmonitoring data, i.e., monitoring results for these employees obtainedwithin a one year period preceding publication of this proposed standard.The Committee distinguished this exemption from the exemption found in(a)(3) on the basis of ``capability of release.'' In this exemption theemployer must know, based on information available to him, that MDA iscapable of being released, but based on his own initial monitoring, willnever exceed the action level. On the other hand, to rely on the exemptionfound in (a)(3) the employer must determine, based on his reasonable relianceon objective data, that MDA is, in fact not capable of being released atall. Again, both require worst case exposure assumptions and that the likelihoodfor dermal exposure is non-existent. (a)(3) Employers may also rely on objective data as the basis for an exemptionbut only when the data indicate that no MDA is ambiently or dermally released.The Committee believes that the primary and intermediate users will bein the best position to test their products and to supply the necessaryobjective data which indicates that MDA is not ambiently released and thereis no likelihood for dermal exposure. This recommended proposed standardthus would not require downstream employers to generate their own objectivedata on the MDA levels likely to be released from a product if they canobtain it from producers or other processors. (a)(4) The proposed standard also would include an exemption for the storage,transportation, distribution, or sale of MDA in intact containers sealedin such a manner as to contain the MDA dusts, vapors, or liquids, exceptfor the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.1200 as incorporated into this standardand the emergency provisions of this standard. Containers would be coveredby the Hazard Communication standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200 (52 FR 31852; Aug.24, 1987), which requires, in conjunction with the proposed MDA standard,labeling containers to indicate that they contain MDA (a suspect carcinogen),employee training specifying what to do if the container was opened orbroken, and supplying material safety data sheets to users/employees. The basis for this exemption is that sealed containers are unlikely ona regular basis to leak sufficient MDA to expose employees over the actionlevel or pose a dermal exposure problem. The labeling and training provisionof the hazard communication standard provides sufficient protection inthose situations where a container breaks so that employees will know howto handle and clean up a spill safely. The intention of this exemptionis to cover warehouses, distributors, supply rooms, and similar operationswhere chemical containers are stored, transported, or sold, and not normallyopened. However, operations where the containers are opened and the contentsused or tested would be covered because of the possibility of exposurein excess of the action level or dermal exposure. (a)(6) The Committee agreed that the employer must appropriately documentthe information which supports any exemption, and the employer must maintaina record of this information. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (b). Definitions </ITAG>Paragraph (b) of the recommended MDA standard for general industry definesa number of terms used in the standard. In some instances, the definitionsrecommended by the Committee are consistent with those found in other OSHAstandards, e.g., ``Director,'' ``Assistant Secretary,'' and ``Authorizedperson''. However, certain other terms require definition because theyare used in accordance with their meanings in general industry.<T3>Action Level. </T3>The Committee recommends that an ``action level''of approximately one-half of the established permissible exposure limitbe established in the proposed regulation. The Committee acknowledged thatthe purpose of the action level is to relieve the burden on employers byproviding a cut-off point for required compliance activities under thestandard. The Committee also agreed that OSHA's statistical basis for determiningthe action level as discussed in connection with several other OSHA healthstandards (see, for example, acrylonitrile, 43 FR 4794) is appropriate.In brief, although all measurements on a given day may fall below the permissibleexposure limit, some possibility exists that on unmeasured days the employee'sactual exposure may exceed the permissible limit. Where exposure measurementsare above one-half of the permissible exposure limit, i.e. the action level,the employer cannot reasonably be confident that the employee may not beoverexposed. (Leidel, N.A. <T3>et al.</T3>, ``Exposure Measurement Action Level and Occupational EnvironmentalVariability.'' DHEW, PHS, DCD, NIOSH, DLCK (August 1975)). Therefore, requiringperiodic employee exposure measurements to begin at the action level providesthe employer with a reasonable degree of confidence in the results of themeasurement program. The Committee also agreed that, in the absence of a demonstrated safe levelof exposure for a carcinogen, it is appropriate to begin some protectiveactions at one-half the PEL or in the case of MDA, 5 parts per billion.Establishing an action level serves such a purpose. <T3>Emergency. </T3>The Committee also recommended including a definitionof an emergency in the proposed standard. Emergency is defined to meanany occurrence such as, but not limited to, equipment failure, ruptureof containers, or failure of control equipment which results in an unexpectedand potentially hazardous release of MDA. Sections of the proposal thatinclude provisions to be met in case of emergencies will include respiratoryprotection, medical surveillance, and employee information and training.<T3>Employee Exposure. </T3>The Committee also recommended that the proposedregulation define ``employee exposure'' to mean that exposure which wouldoccur if the employee were not using a respirator or personal protectiveequipment. The employee's exposure measurements would be made without regardto any use of personal protective equipment. The Committee agreed thatexposure monitoring is not a single-purpose activity. It is necessary toknow employee exposure levels without the use of respiratory protectionto evaluate the effectiveness of engineering and work practice controlsand to determine whether additional controls must be instituted. In addition,monitoring is necessary to determine which respirator, if any, must beused by the employee. This definition is consistent with OSHA's previoususe of the term ``employee exposure'' in other health standards. <T3>Definition of MDA. </T3>The Committee recommended that the proposedregulation include the salts of MDA in the definition of MDA. The Committeeexamined the data furnished by the NTP bioassays and found that a saltof MDA, methylenedihydrochloride was used. Further the Committee examineddata which indicate that the salts of MDA are converted to the free aminewhich presents the final exposure problem. Thus the Committee recommendedincluding the salts of MDA in the definition of MDA. The Committee wasnot aware of a commercial use of any of the salts of MDA although informationfurnished by Eastman Kodak indicated that the company of Psaltz and Bauerdid produce the dihydrochloride for resale (Ex. 9). The Committee also recommended excluding from the definition unreactedMDA contained in solid materials and physically bound thereby preventingthe release of MDA. Since it is unlikely that the unreacted MDA containedin solids will impose a significant health hazard, the Committee agreedto exclude it from the scope of the standard. The exclusion proposed isintended to omit from the standard's coverage products that do not releaseMDA. <T3>Regulated Areas. </T3>The Committee recommended that the proposal requirethe employer to establish regulated areas wherever MDA exposures reasonablycan be expected to exceed the permissible exposure limits or where thelikelihood for dermal exposure exists. The Committee recommended that accessto these areas be regulated and limited to authorized persons. In addition,regulated areas are to be demarcated in any manner that minimizes the numberof employees exposed to MDA within these areas. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (c). Permissible exposure limit (PEL) </ITAG>The Committee recommended that OSHA promulgate a standard for occupationalexposure to MDA. The Committee believes that the provisions of its proposedstandard will dramatically reduce dermal exposure to MDA and will limitairborne exposure to MDA by establishing a PEL of 10 ppb as an 8-hour TWA.The Committee also recommends that the standard contain a STEL for airborneMDA exposures of 100 ppb determined in any 15-minute sampling period. Therecommendations contained in the Committee's proposed standard are supportedby the Committee's findings that occupational exposure to MDA under currentoccupational conditions poses a risk to the health of employees and thatthe proposed standard, if adopted, can achieve the desired reduction inthat risk.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (d). Emergency Situation </ITAG>The Committee agreed that available health data suggest that elevated short-termexposure to MDA should be viewed with concern. The Committee recommendedthat an unexpected high exposure must be viewed as an emergency situation.A written plan would be required where there is a possibility of an emergencyand procedures for alerting employees in the event that an emergency occurs.The recommended provisions also include a requirement to alert employeesother than those who have the potential to be directly exposed in an emergencysituation. Such employees may be employees from neighboring work siteswho may inadvertently approach the emergency site. They may also includeemployees from other work shifts or employees who may be later exposedto work surfaces or equipment contaminated as a result of the emergency.The Committee also recommended the development of a written plan for eachworkplace where there is a possibility of an emergency. The plan shallinclude the elements prescribed in 29 CFR 1910.38, ``Employee emergencyplans and fire prevention plans.'' The Committee believed that the performance language of the emergency situationparagraph will give employers the flexibility to choose any effective methodof alerting employees, including communications systems, voice communication,or a bell or other alarm. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (e). Exposure Monitoring </ITAG>The Committee noted that section 6(b)(7) of the Act (29 U.S.C. 655) mandatesthat any standard promulgated under section 6(b) shall, where appropriate,provide for monitoring or measuring employee exposure at such locationsand intervals and in such manner as may be necessary for the protectionof employees. Thus, the Committee recommended that any proposed MDA standard would requireeach employer to conduct monitoring to determine employee exposure to MDA.The Committee agreed that it is appropriate for employers to measure employeeexposure to MDA for the following reasons. First, exposure monitoring informsthe employer whether the employer's legal obligation to keep employee exposurebelow the permissible exposure levels is being met. Second, exposure monitoringevaluates the effectiveness of engineering and work practice controls andinforms the employer whether additional controls need to be instituted.Third, exposure monitoring is necessary to determine whether respiratoryprotection is required at all and, if so, which respirator is to be selected.Fourth, section 8(c)(3) of the Act (29 U.S.C. 657) requires employers tonotify promptly any employee who has been or is being exposed to toxicmaterials or harmful physical agents at levels which exceed those prescribedby an applicable occupational safety or health standard, and to informsuch employee of the corrective action being taken. Exposure monitoringis necessary in order to determine whether employees are being exposedto MDA at levels exceeding those prescribed by this standard. Finally,the results of exposure monitoring constitute a vital part of the informationwhich must be supplied to the physician and may contribute informationon the causes and prevention of occupational illness. The exposure monitoring recommendations made by the Committee would requirethe employer to determine the exposure for each employee exposed to MDA.It is not necessary to provide separate measurements for each employee.If a number of employees perform essentially the same job under the sameconditions, it may be sufficient to monitor a fraction of such employeesto obtain data that are representative of the remaining employees. Representativepersonal sampling for employees engaged in similar work and exposed tosimilar MDA levels can be achieved by measuring that member of the exposedgroup reasonably expected to have the highest exposure. This result wouldthen be attributed to the remaining employees of the group. In many specific work situations, the representative monitoring approachcan be more cost-effective in identifying the exposures of affected employees.Furthermore, employers may use any monitoring strategy which correctlyidentifies the extent to which all employees are exposed. Because of the nature of the MDA exposure hazard, it is necessary thatthe scope of the proposal be as broad as possible to protect potentiallyexposed employees. However, many employers will be required only to performinitial monitoring to determine employee exposures. If the results of initialmonitoring demonstrate that an employee's exposure to MDA is below theaction level, the employer is allowed to discontinue monitoring and otheractivities under this provision of the standard for that employee. TheCommittee established this provision to reduce the burden on employers,while providing them with an objective means of determining whether theymust take additional steps for compliance wlth the standard. The Committee recommendation also contains provisions for periodic monitoring.The more frequent the measurement, the higher the accuracy of the employeeexposure profile. Selecting an appropriate interval between monitoringefforts is a matter of judgment. Where exposure measurements are determinedto be above the permissible exposure limits, the employer is required tomonitor every 3 months. Where exposure measurements are above the actionlevel but at or below the PELs, monitoring may be required only at 6 monthintervals. Additional monitoring may also be required for a particularjob position if any changes in production, processes, control measures,or personnel result in new or additional exposure to MDA. The redeterminationof employee exposure is necessary to assure that the most recent resultsaccurately represent existing exposure conditions. This is necessary sothe employer may take appropriate action such as instituting additionalengineering controls or providing appropriate respiratory protection. The Committee also recommended that provisions for visual monitoring ofexposed skin areas be made. The employer would be required to make routineinspections of employee dermal areas potentially exposed to MDA. If theemployer determines that the employee has been exposed to MDA the employershall: (a) Determine the source of exposure; (b) Implement protective measures to correct the hazard; and (c) Maintain records of the corrective actions in accordance with paragraph(n) of this section. The Committee fully realized that visual monitoring of exposed skin foryellow staining is a useful tool in controlling employee exposure to somehazardous substances. Finally, the Committee recommended that the employer must maintain a recordof the corrective actions which he has taken. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (f). Regulated Areas </ITAG>The Committee-recommended proposal requires the employer to establish regulatedareas where the potential for airborne concentrations of MDA in excessof the permissible exposure limits exists; and where the likelihood ofdermal exposure exists. This requirement is designed to minimize the numberof employees exposed to concentrations of MDA. The requirement has beentiered to reflect the difference in employee exposure to ambient concentrationsof MDA and the potential for dermal deposition. Unauthorized employeesare restricted from entering the regulated areas. Other purposes of thissection are to designate those areas where precautionary signs are to beposted and to designate areas where employees may be subject to three-monthmonitoring when their exposure is above the PEL and where activities suchas smoking, eating, are prohibited. Additionally, employees working inregulated areas are required to wear the appropriate type of personal protectiveequipment.The Committee recommended that regulated areas are to be demarcated inany manner that minimizes the number of employees exposed to MDA withinthese areas. To increase the performance-orientation of the standard andminimize recordkeeping, the Committee recommended that no detailed requirementsbe specified regarding the demarcating of an area. The Committee recommendation for establishing a requirement for regulatedareas is tiered. A traditional approach is recommended for establishingregulated areas at all worksites where the permissible exposure limit isexceeded. This approach covers areas within worksites where there are frequentleaks, or where exposures may be of high concentration but of short duration,e.g., maintenance operations. Where the likelihood for exposure resultsonly from contact with liquid mixtures in the low vapor state, the Committeerecommends that a regulated area be established where employees are engagedin routine or non-routine processes requiring the handling, application,or use of MDA. The Committee recognized that at its low vapor state liquidmixtures probably would not exceed the PELs; however, the potential forcontact and inadvertent exposure was great and thus a mechanism to preventincidental exposure of employees not actively engaged in the process wasvery much needed. The purpose of a regulated area is to ensure that employersmake employees aware of the presence of MDA and attempt to restrict access.By limiting access, the number of employees inadvertently splashed andsubsequently exposed to MDA can be minimized. The Committee agreed that the establishment of regulated areas is an effectivemeans of limiting the risk of exposure to as few employees as possible.This is consistent with good industrial hygiene practice when exposureto a toxic substance can cause serious health effects. Access to the regulatedareas is restricted to ``authorized persons''; that is, those persons requiredby their job duties to be present in the area; specifically, to those authorizedentry by the employer, this proposal, or the OSH Act. By limiting accessto these areas to authorized persons only, the additional obligation imposedby the proposal when PPE is used will be limited to as few persons as possible.The reasons that regulated areas are to be established in all work areaswhere the PEL is exceeded, including maintenance operations, is that itis the Committee's view that the existence of a hazard, rather than thetype of operation or work being performed, should be the basis for establishmentof a regulated area. Areas where exposures are temporarily over the PELswhile maintenance is being performed need to be demarcated to warn employeesnot performing the repairs and restrict access to these areas. Further,employees who enter the area are thereby warned to wear the appropriateprotective equipment when entering. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (g). Methods of Compliance </ITAG>The Committee's recommended standard proposes that feasible engineeringand work practice controls reduce employee exposures to or below the permissiblelimits. In situations where engineering controls that can be institutedimmediately will not reduce exposures to the permissible exposure limits,these controls must nonetheless be used to reduce exposures to the lowestfeasible level and be supplemented by the use of respirators. In addition,a compliance program to reduce exposures to within the permissible exposurelimits solely by means of engineering and work practice controls must bedeveloped and implemented. Written plans for this program must be developedand furnished upon request for examination and copying to representativesof the Assistant Secretary, representatives of the Director, and affectedemployees. These plans must be reviewed and updated annually to reflectthe current status of the program. The Committee recognized that there are certain activities, often involvingcertain maintenance and repair operations, as well as in emergency situations,in which the use of engineering controls to control exposures will notbe feasible, regardless of the permissible exposure limits in the standard.Where the employer can show that engineering controls for such operationsare not feasible, respirators shall be permitted as a primary means ofcontrol. It has been OSHA policy to require that employers use feasible engineeringand work practice controls to prevent excessive employee exposures andthat respirators be used as an alternative only when other methods arenot adequate, are not feasible, or have not yet been installed. The Committee'srecommendation is based on this OSHA policy. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (h). Respiratory Protection</ITAG>The Committee recommendation provides that where respirators are necessaryto limit employee exposures to below the permissible exposure limits, theemployer must provide the respirators at no cost to the employee, and requirethat the employees use them. A table of respirators for use with MDA is included in the standard provisions.The primary basis for the selection and evaluation of respirators is currentOSHA policy and is generally used in standard development. The Committeeagreed to accept the current OSHA policies found in the respirator selectionsection even though the Committee realized that OSHA is currently revisingits respiratory protection standards. The Committee is making this recommendationwith the understanding that, when OSHA amends its current respiratory protectionstandards, the respiratory section including the selection table will berecodified. The Committee agreed that respirator use would also be restricted to thetime necessary to install or implement feasible engineering and work practicecontrols. Further, respirators must be used in (1) operations in whichengineering and work practice controls are not feasible (e.g., certainmaintenance operations), (2) work operations for which the feasible engineeringand work practice controls are not sufficient to reduce exposures to orbelow the PEL, and (3) emergency situations. The Committee also recommended that each employee be properly trained towear a respirator, to know why the respirator is needed, and to understandthe limitations of the respirator. An understanding of the hazard involvedis necessary to enable the employee to take steps for his or her own protection.The respiratory protection program implemented by the employer must conformto that set forth in 29 CFR 1910.134. This provision contains basic requirementsfor proper selection, fit, use, cleaning, and maintenance of respirators.The Committee also believes emergencies are situations where respiratorsmust be used to protect employees. Since it is unrealistic to predict theexpected contaminant concentrations to which an employee may be exposedin all emergencies, the Committee recommends the use of respirators ofthe type approved for protection against unknown concentration. If an employeeis working in an area and using an approved respirator of the type appropriatefor the existing concentration, and an emergency occurs, the employee ofcourse should continue using the respirator during his escape. Provisionsto provide proper protection for emergency personnel assigned to entervessels or workplaces containing an unknown concentration to rescue workersor to control the release of the contaminant or perform any necessary repairswill be required to be a part of the emergency plan. In addition, thisparagraph will ensure that employers identify operations in which emergenciesare apt to occur and make respirators available to employees in these operations.The Committee also recommends the use of qualitative or quantitative fittests. When negative pressure respirators are used, proper fit is especiallycritical to prevent leakage of contaminated air into the facepiece. The employer must ensure that the employees' respirators fit properly andthat leakage is minimal. A rapid qualitative fit test can be performedas either a positive-pressure test, in which the exhalation valve is closedand the wearer exhales into the facepiece to produce a positive pressure,or a negative pressure test, in which the inhalation valve is closed andthe wearer inhales so that the facepiece collapses slightly. Employeesshould be trained to perform this test. The Committee also recommends that OSHA make use of the fit testing appendixto ensure that the employer does the proper testing to achieve adequacyof fit testing. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (i). Protective Work Clothing and Equipment </ITAG>The Committee recommendation would require the employer to provide andthe employee to wear the appropriate protective clothing to prevent eyeand dermal contact with MDA. The Committee also agreed that the personalprotective recommendations should be harmonious with the general provisionsunder andSection;andSection; 1910.132 and 1910.133. The equipment is to beprovided at no cost to the employee, and includes the use of these itemsas may be necessary to protect employees at each particular work situationfrom exposure to MDA, including, where appropriate, such items as faceshields, gloves, aprons, coveralls, or footwear. Contact with liquid MDA irritates the eyes and may result in corneal burnsif the MDA is splashed in the eyes. When there is a realistic possibilityof splashing the eyes, precautions are needed. Eye and face protectionis currently required by 29 CFR 1910.133, and the types of safety gogglesand face shields required by this section to prevent eye and face injuryare readily available from safety products companies nationwide. The requirement in this proposed MDA standard attempts to prevent skincontact with MDA. The risk assessment agreed upon by the Committee analyzesrisk associated with dermal exposure and found that a 20 fold increasein risk could be prevented by not allowing dermal contact with MDA. MDAis easily absorbed through the skin at the rate of 2 andCx.18;/cm\2\ perhour. In addition, recent studies by El Hawari (Ex. 1-260) indicate thatthe absorption of MDA peaks 5 hours after the end of the work shift andthat 80% of the substance is cleared from the body within 24 hours of exposure.While MDA may induce yellow staining of the skin, a very precise indicatorthat exposure has occurred, it is difficult to correlate the amount depositedon the skin with a biological indicator, such as the amount found in theurine. There are many confounding factors which lead to these findings.Firstly, through absorption rates it is apparent that MDA easily entersthe body. Secondly, once deposited on the skin absorption continues althoughthe worker may have long since left the work place and the apparent exposurearea. Thirdly, once absorbed into the body the chemical is rapidly eliminatedso that using a biological indicator, such as urine measurement, may notdetect the apparent exposure. All in all MDA can be considered a chemicalwith poor biological warning properties or biological indicators of exposure.The best protective measures which can be taken are to simply prevent skincontact and subsequent absorption. This will in turn reduce both the riskof cancer and the potential for hepatotoxicity. The Committee-recommended proposal is performance-oriented and requiresthe employer to survey the work situation in determining the type of protectiveequipment needed. For example, when handling solid materials the employeemay be required to wear full body coveralls, and gloves which must be removedat the end of the shift and laundered before being worn again. This employeewould also be required to shower at the end of the work shift. Employeesrequired to work only with liquids or MDA liquid mixtures may not be requiredto wear full body coveralls but instead may be required to wear an apron,and gloves. If the employee does become splashed with MDA or other substancescontaining MDA, the employee must be directed to immediately remove theclothing, wash the affected area, and put on clean clothing if necessary.The employer may require employees to discard gloves when removed and usea new pair of gloves after breaks, lunch, etc. The employee's gloves mustbe sufficiently protect1ve or changed often enough so that MDA-wetted materialis not kept in contact with the skin. The performance approach grants an employer flexibility to achieve thegoal of minimizing MDA contact with the skin in a manner the employer findsmost effective. However, being performance oriented, it is of necessitymore general and requires the employer to consider the work process inorder to achieve the desired goal in the manner that the employer believesis most efficient. This provision is designed to prevent the employee fromcoming in contact on a regular basis with MDA or MDA contaminated substances.The employer must be aware that maintaining the effectiveness of the protectiveequipment and clothing used is also of keen importance. Exposure occursby (1) bulk penetration through pinholes, rips, zippers, seams, etc.; (2)material failure through chemical degradation; or (3) permeation throughthe material. While not specifically recommended, the Committee discussed the likelihoodof requiring the employer to use permeation data to determine the effectivenessof protective clothing. Permeation depends on MDA concentration, thicknessof protective material, temperature, and age of protective clothing. LiquidMDA that may be spilled on aprons, coveralls, or footwear or other protectiveclothing other than gloves can be wiped off within a few minutes time.Therefore, the materials used to make these types of protective clothesneed to be impervious to MDA only for a few minutes. However, the liquidMDA permeability rate for materials used to make gloves needs to be lessthan that for other protective equipment since it is less likely that gloveswill be wiped off when liquid contact occurs. Breakthrough times of MDAthrough various protective clothing materials differ widely, and the choiceof material for protection against MDA breakthrough depends on the typeof operation involved and length of time of contact, other solvents present,and other factors. Because of the uncertainty associated with requiringthis sort of testing, the Committee chose to develop recommended regulationswhich give the employer the options of choosing the methodology reliedupon to assure that the effectiveness of protective clothing is achieved.Nonetheless, although there have been limited tests of protective clothingand devices conducted for various toxic materials. The Committee recognizedthat all clothing and equipment are not equally protective, and in somecases may realistically provide no effective protection. The data analysisdone by the Committee indicated that polyvinyl chloride (PVC), naturallatex, and polyethelene are currently the best candidates for protectionagainst this methanolic solution containing MDA. The Committee recognized that the potential for the employer to ignorefactors which determine effectiveness of the protective equipment was great.The Committee recommended, however, that the employer be obligated to takethe appropriate measures to ensure that workers are not dermally exposedto MDA, and allows the employer the option of choosing the protective clothingor equipment which will achieve this goal. How much clothing and the typeof protective clothing needed will depend on the potential for exposureand the conditions of use. The employer in exercising his reasonable judgmentin the workplace should be able to select the appropriate clothing or equipmentin accordance with this paragraph which satisfies the legal obligationdefined by this paragraph. The Committee allowed the employer this freedombecause the Committee felt that there were checks and balances on the effectivenessof the clothing and equipment built into other standard provisions. Forexample, MDA-yellow staining of the skin could easily identify areas ofthe body where protective clothing or equipment was not effective. In addition,the medical surveillance provisions recommended by the Committee woulddetect workers who were adversely affected as a result of occupationalexposure to MDA. Many of the Committee members expressed concern with the requirement thatthe employee remove protective clothing only in change rooms. As examples,they indicated that workers usually remove gloves and discard contaminatedprotective clothing before entering lunch facilities. Clearly it appearsthat to require employees to return to the change rooms to discard protectiveequipment, in this instance, appears to be unwarranted. Of course, theemployer who allows the employee to dispose of contaminated clothing inareas outside of the change rooms is still obligated to comply with therequirements for the proper disposal of MDA contaminated materials. Inaddition, the Committee recommended that clothing not routinely removedthroughout the day must be removed at the end of the shift in change rooms.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (j). Hygiene Facilities and Practices </ITAG>The recommended proposed standard contains a variety of regulatory optionsfor the use of shower and change room facilities and lunch rooms for employeesexposed to MDA. The purpose of this section is two-fold. First, it is designed to minimizethe exposure to MDA of those workers directly exposed to MDA. Second, itis designed to prevent the inadvertent occupational exposure to MDA ofother workers with no expected occupational exposure to MDA. The standardalso recognizes that there are two routes of exposure, inhalation and dermal,and that they may occur in the same workplaces. Therefore, the provisionsof this section are tiered. For example, whenever food or beverages are consumed at the worksite andemployees are exposed to MDA the employer shall provide readily accessiblelunch areas. Lunch facilities in plants where only dermal exposures mayoccur may not require the same stringent controls as in those facilitieswhere airborne exposures also occur. It is for this reason that only lunchfacilities located in areas at or above the PEL must be equipped with apositive pressure filtered air supply, whereas lunch facilities locatedin areas where exposure to only liquid mixtures of MDA occurs need onlybe established in an area free of MDA accumulations. Likewise, showers may be necessary for workers exposed to dusts or vapors;however, showers may not be necessary for workers only exposed to liquids.Workers exposed to liquids must be immediately instructed to wash exposedareas with soap and water or any media which does not increase the absorptionproperties of MDA. This particular recommendation was given much considerationby the Committee. The Committee expressed concern with the appropriate manner inwhich MDAshould be removed from the skin. However, the Committee did not want torecommend that only soap and water be used to remove MDA impregnated resinaccumulations. In fact, the Committee felt that it was better, should exposureoccur, to remove the hardened resin as soon as possible even if a solventmust be used. The Committee recommended that if the employer can demonstratethat a particular solvent does not increase the absorption properties ofMDA it should be used to remove MDA from the skin. Furthermore, because the Committee recognized that accidents, ineffectivepersonal protective equipment, and ineffective work practices might leadto employee exposure, the Committee recommended stringent provisions forselection, use, and maintenance of personal protective clothing and equipment.Because it is difficult to remove safely this acute toxin from the skin,it is simply better not to get the material on the skin. The Committee recommended that all employers covered by this provisionwould be required to assure that employees wash hands and face with soapand water prior to eating, drinking, smoking or applying cosmetics, andtaking breaks. This recommendation is intended to prevent the accidentalingestion of MDA. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (k). Communication of Hazards to Employees </ITAG>(1) <T3>Signs and Labels. </T3>The Committee recommended that the employerpost and maintain legible signs demarcating regulated areas and entrancesor access ways to regulated areas with the following legend:<ITAG tagnum="71">DANGER </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">MDA </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">MAY CAUSE CANCER, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">LIVER TOXIN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">RESPIRATORS AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING MAY BE REQUIRED TO BE WORN INTHIS AREA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The recommendation also requires labelling of containers of MDA. Thelabels must state. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) MDA </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">DANGER </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">CONTAINS MDA </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">MAY CAUSE CANCER, LIVER TOXIN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Mixtures contain MDA </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">DANGER </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">CONTAINS MDA </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">CONTAINS MATERIAL WHICH MAY CAUSE CANCER, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">LIVER TOXIN </ITAG>The Committee's recommendations are consistent with section 6(b)(7) ofthe Act, which prescribes the use of labels or other appropriate formsof warning to apprise employees of the hazards to which they are exposed.It is required that labels remain affixed to containers leaving the workplace.The purpose of this requirement is to assure that all affected employees,not only those of a particular employer, are apprised of the hazardousnature of MDA exposure. It is the Committee's view that informing employees of the hazards to whichthey are exposed is an important element in reducing oocupational diseaseand injury and one of the significant purposes of the Act. Section 6(b)(7)of the Act does not limit an employer's obligation to inform employeesof hazardous conditions, to the employer's own employees. When an employermanufactures, formulates, or sells a product, the employer may create exposuresnot only to his or her own employees, but also to the employees of otheremployers involved in handling, transporting, or using the product. Theextent of the obligation to inform should be commensurate with the extentof the exposure. This is especially true where the manufacturer, formulator,or seller will, in many cases, be the only employer capable, through hisknowledge of the product, of providing the information necessary for protectionof employees. A narrower reading of the statutory authority would defeatthe protective purposes of the Act by effectively preventing the downstreamemployee from obtaining adequate information about the hazard. Furthermore,the use of labels required by the standard will alert other employers whowould not otherwise know of the presence of MDA in their workplace of theirobligation to comply with the standard. The Committee therefore feels thatthis requirement would be necessary and appropriate. The Committee's recommendation also requires the posting of warning signsto demarcate regulated areas. These signs are intended to supplement thetraining which employees are required to receive under the standard. Eventrained employees will need t be reminded of the locations of regulatedareas and the dangers of entering these areas. In addition, other personnel,such as employees of independent maintenance contractors authorized toenter regulated areas, need to be reminded of the locations of regulatedareas, the dangers of entering these areas, and the need to use protectiveequipment. The Committee agreed that both signs and training are necessaryto apprise employees adequately of the hazards associated with MDA exposure.The Committee also recommended specific wording of the warning signs forregulated areas to assure that the proper warning is given to employees.The word ``Danger'' is used to attract the attention of workers, to alertthem to the fact that they are in a hazardous area and to emphasize theimportance of the message that follows. In addition, the use of the word``Danger'' is consistent with recent OSHA health standards dealing withcarcinogens. The proposed sign legend: ``Respirators and Protective ClothingMay be Required to Be Worn In This Area,'' recognizes that there may bea difference between the MDA concentration in air or the potential to besplashed with liquid mixtures (the bases which determine when a regulatedarea must be established), and a particular employee's likely exposure.(2) <T3>Material Safety Data Sheet. </T3>The Committee also recommended statementsto be incorporated into a material safety data sheet. This material canbe found in Appendix B.(3) <T3>Employee information and training. </T3>The Committee recommended thatall employers provide a training program for all employees exposed to MDAinitially at the time of assignment and at least annually there after.The Committee recommended that an information and training program is essentialto inform employees of the hazards to which they are exposed and to provideemployees with the necessary understanding of the degree to which eachemployee can contribute toward minimizing health hazard potentials.The content of the training program is intended to inform employees of:(1) The hazards to which they are exposed; (2) the necessary steps to protectthemselves, including those to be taken during emergency situations; (3)limitations and the proper use of respirators and protective equipment;(4) a description of medical examinations and their purpose; (5) implementationof work practices and the use of available engineering controls; and (6)the contents of this standard. Section 6(b)(7) of the Act makes it clearthat these are appropriate goals for an employee training program, andthe proposed standard includes such provisions.The Committee also agreed that the employer would be required to make acopy of the standard and its appendices available to affected employeesand their representatives. This requirement, in combination with the reviewprovided for as part of the training program, is intended to ensure thatemployees understand their rights and duties under this standard.The employer is also required to provide, upon request, all materials relatingto the training program to the Assistant Secretary and Director. This isintended to provide an objective check of compliance with the requirementsunder this paragraph.The Committee realized that MDA may be only one of a number of substancesto which an employee may be exposed simultaneously in the workplace. Theeducation and training requirements in this standard contain those elementsOSHA has determined to be basic. The format and content of the requiredtraining and information program are neither rigid nor extensive.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (l). Housekeeping </ITAG>The Committee's recommendation requires that employers institute a programto detect leaks, spills and discharges of MDA which includes visual inspections.When leaks, spills, or discharges of MDA are detected, the proposed languagerequires the employer to repair promptly all leaks and clean up all spills.These work practices aid in minimizing the number of employees exposed,as well as the extent of any potential for MDA exposure. Prevention and removal of accumulations of liquid MDA on all surfaces arecritically important aspects of minimizing employee exposure. The liquid,if allowed to remain on the floor or work surfaces, will slowly evaporateand contribute to a possible airborne hazard, or it may become a dermalhazard through inadvertent skin contact. MDA's low vapor pressure whichresults in slow evaporation will contribute to and prolong the hazard.The requirement to clean up spills and drips refers to the prevention andremoval of visible accumulations of liquid MDA on all surfaces. In addition to the hazards of exposure to MDA in its liquid forms, hazardsalso result from exposure to the dusts of MDA. Thus, the recommended languagecontains provisions for maintaining surfaces as free as possible of accumulationsof dusts and waste containing MDA. Surfaces contaminated with dusts maynot be cleaned by the use of compressed air. The recommended standard requiresHEPA-filtered vacuuming equipment for vacuuming. This equipment must beemptied in a manner which minimizes the reentry of MDA dusts into the workplace.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (m). Medical Surveillance </ITAG>The Committee's recommendation requires that each employer institute amedical surveillance program for all employees exposed to MDA accordingly:(1) Employees exposed at or above the action level for more than 30 daysper year; (2) Employees who have the likelihood of dermal exposure for more than15 days per year; (3) Employees who have been exposed in an emergency situation; and (4) Employees whom the employer has reason to believe are being dermallyexposed as a result of monitoring in accordance with paragraph (e)(8) ofthis section. The recommended language requires that the medical surveillance programprovide each covered employee with an opportunity for a medical examination.Further, all examinations and procedures must be performed by or underthe supervision of a licensed physician and be provided without cost tothe employee. Clearly, a licensed physician is the appropriate person tosupervise and evaluate medical examinations. However, certain parts ofthe required examination do not necessarily require the physician's expertiseand may be conducted by another person under the supervision of the physician.The Committee also recommends that examinations be given at a reasonabletime and place. It is necessary that examinations be convenient and beprovided without loss of pay to the employee to assure that they are taken.The proposal allows the examining physician to prescribe the specific teststo be included in the medical surveillance program. Also included are somespecific requirements, such as: (i) Comprehensive medical and work histories with special emphasis directedto an evaluation of other carcinogens to which the employee is exposed,and smoking and alcohol use. (ii) Comprehensive physical examination, with particular emphasis givento symptoms related to skin disease and liver dysfunction. (iii) Urinalysis. (iv) Screening for liver damage. It is important to note that the employer is required to make any prescribedtests available more often than specified if recommended by the examiningphysician. The Committee also recommended that the employer provide examinations advisedby the physician to any employee exposed to MDA under emergency conditions.Due to the effects of high short-term exposures, it appears prudent tomonitor such affected employees in light of existing health data. However,trivial exposure, for example, to a single drop of an MDA-containing mixturewould not trigger the emergency examination requirement, particularly ifthe employee was able to remove the MDA immediately after exposure. The employer will also be required to provide the physician with the followinginformation: a copy of this standard and its appendices; a descriptionof the affected employee's duties as they relate to the employee exposurelevel; and information from the employee's previous medical examinationswhich is not readily available to the examining physician. Making thisinformation available to the physician will aid in the evaluation of theemployee's health in relation to assigned duties and fitness to wear personalprotective equipment. The employer is required to obtain a written opinion from the examiningphysician that contains the results of the medical examination; the physician'sopinion as to whether the employee has any detected medical conditionswhich would place the employee at increased risk of material health impairmentfrom exposure to MDA; any recommended restrictions upon the employee'sexposure to MDA or upon the use of protective clothing or equipment suchas respirators; and a statement that the employee has been informed bythe physician of the results of the medical examination and of any medicalconditions which require further explanation or treatment. This writtenopinion must not reveal specific findings or diagnoses unrelated to occupationalexposure to MDA, and a copy of the opinion must be provided to the affectedemployee. The purpose in requiring the examining physician to supply the employerwith a written opinion is to provide the employer with a medical basisto aid in the determination of initial placement of employees and to assessthe employee's ability to use protective clothing and equipment. The requirementthat a physician's opinion be in written form will ensure that employershave had the benefit of this information. The requirement that an employeebe provided with a copy of the physician's written opinion will ensurethat the employee is informed of the results of the medical examination.The purpose in requiring that specific findings or diagnoses unrelatedto occupational exposure to MDA not be included in the written opinionis to encourage employees to take the medical examination by removing theconcern that the employer will obtain information about their physicalcondition that has no relation to present occupational exposures. The Committee's recommendation also includes a multiple physician reviewmechanism. This provision is triggered by the employee disagreeing withthe opinion of the examining physician selected by the employer to conductany medical examination as a result of signs and/or symptoms indicativeof occupational exposure to MDA. Finally, the recommended proposal contains provisions for removing an employeefrom exposure who has suffered reversible material impairment to healthas a result of being exposed to MDA. The majority of the Committee membersagreed that employees whose health has been adversely affected as a directresult of occupational exposure to MDA should be removed from exposureand should receive medical removal benefit protections. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (n). Recordkeeping </ITAG>The Committee's recommendations are consistent with section 8(c)(3) ofthe Act which provides for the promulgation of regulations requiring employersto maintain accurate records of employee exposures to potentially toxicor harmful physical agents which are required to be monitored or measured.The Committee recommended that objective data be used for any exemptionsfrom the standard. Records of objective data must be maintained to demonstratethat employees will not be exposed to airborne MDA concentrations and thatthe potential for dermal exposure does not exist.The Committee also recommended that records be kept to identify the employeemonitored and to reflect the employee's exposure accurately. Specifically,records must include the following information: (a) The names and socialsecurity numbers of the employees sampled; (b) the number, duration, andresults of each of the samples taken, including a description of the representativesampling procedure and equipment used to determine employee exposure whereapplicable; (c) a description of the operation involving exposure to MDAwhich is being monitored and the date on which monitoring is performed;(d) the type of respiratory protective devices, if any, worn by the employee;and (e) a description of the sampling and analytical methods used, andevidence of their accuracy. The Committee's recommendation also includes a provision for requiringthe employer to keep an accurate medical record for each employee subjectto medical surveillance. Section 8(c) of the Act authorizes the promulgationof regulations requiring any employer to keep such records regarding theemployer's activities relating to the Act as are necessary or appropriatefor the enforcement of the Act or for developing information regardingthe causes and prevention of occupational illnesses. The Committee believesthat medical records, like exposure monitoring records, are necessary andappropriate to both the enforcement of the standard and the developmentof information regarding the causes and prevention of illness. The employer is also required to keep a record of any employee's medicalremoval and return to work status. The recommended proposal requires that all records required to be keptshall be made available upon request to the Assistant Secretary and theDirector of NIOSH for examination and copying. Access to these recordsis necessary for the agencies to monitor compliance with the standard.These records may also contain information needed by the agencies to carryout their other statutory responsibilities. The recommended proposal would also provide for employees, former employees,and their designated representative to have access to mandated recordsupon request. Section 8(c)(3) of rhe Act explicitly provides ``employeesor their representatives'' with an opportunity to observe monitoring andto have access to the records of monitoring and exposures to toxic substances;several other provisions of the Act contemplate that employees and theirrepresentatives are entitled to play an active role in the enforcementof the Act. Access to exposure and medical records by employees, designated representatives,and OSHA shall be established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.20. By itsterms, it applies to records required by specific standards, such as thisMDA standard, as well as records which are voluntarily created by employers.In general, it provides for unrestricted employee and designated representativeaccess to exposure records. Access to medical records is also providedto employees and, if the employee has given specific written consent, tothe employee's designated representatives. The Committee recommends thatunrestricted access to both kinds of records be allowed, but access topersonally identifiable records is made subject to rules of agency practiceand procedure concerning OSHA access to employee medical records, whichhave been published at 29 CFR 1913.10. An extensive discussion of the provisionsand rationale for andSection; 1920.20 may be found at 45 FR 35312; the discussionof andSection; 1913.10 may be found at 45 FR 35384. It is necessary to keep records for extended periods because of the longlatency periods commonly observed for carcinogens. Cancer often cannotbe detected until 20 or more years after onset of exposure. The extendedretention period is therefore needed for two purposes. Diagnosis of diseasein employees is assisted by having present and past exposure data as wellas the results of the medical exams. Retaining records for extended periodsalso makes it possible at some future date to review the adequacy of thestandard. The time periods recommended for retention of exposure records and medicalrecords are thirty years, and period of employment plus thirty years, respectively.These retention periods are consistent with those found in other OSHA healthstandards. The recommended proposal would also require certain employers to notifythe Director in writing at least 3 months prior to the disposal of therecords. Section 1910.20(h) also contains requirements regarding the transferof records. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (o). Observation of Monitoring </ITAG>The Committee also recommends that OSHA include a provision for observationof exposure monitoring. This provision is in accordance with section 8(c)of the OSH Act which requires that employers provide employees and theirrepresentatives with the opportunity to observe monitoring of employeeexposures to toxic substances or harmful physical agents. Any observermust be provided with the personal protective clothing and equipment thatis required to be worn by the employees who are working in the area. Theemployer is required to assure the use of such clothing and equipment orrespirators and is responsible for requiring that the observer complieswith all other applicable safety and health procedures. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (p). Effective Dates </ITAG>The Committee did not establish a section for effective dates. However,the Committee did not indicate in any of its feasibility findings thatany specific time would be needed to comply with the implementation ofany of the recommendated standards. Thus OSHA has developed its effectivedate section based on the feasibility analysis recommended by the Committee.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (q). Appendices </ITAG>Five appendices have been included at the end of this proposed standard.Appendices A, B, C, and D have been included primarily for purposes ofinformation. None of the statements contained in Appendices A, B, C, andD should be construed as establishing a mandatory requirement not otherwiseimposed by the standard, or as detracting from an obligation which thestandard does impose. However, the protocols for respiratory fit testingin Appendix E are mandatory. Appendix A contains information on the description and exposure levelsof MDA. Also provided in Appendix A is information on the health hazardsassociated with exposure, descriptions of protective clothing and equipment,emergency and first aid procedures, medical requirements, provisions forthe observation of monitoring, access to exposure and medical records,and precautions for the safe use, handling, and storage of MDA. Appendix B contains ``substance technical guidelines'' for MDA, includingphysical and chemical data, spill and leak procedures, including wastedisposal methods, and other miscellaneous precautions for the safe handlingof MDA. Appendix C contains the medical surveillance guidelines for MDA. Includedin these guidelines are the description of the routes of entry, the toxicologyand symptoms and signs associated with MDA exposure, information on thetreatment of acute toxic effects, and surveillance and preventive considerations,including hematology guidelines which may be useful to physicians in conductingthe medical surveillance program required by paragraph (m) of this recommendedstandard. Appendix D gives details of the recommended sampling and analytical methodsfor use in monitoring employee exposures to MDA. Appendix E gives detailed fit testing procedures that are to be followedfor qualitative or quantitative fit testing of negative pressure respirators.Various protocols for qualitative and quantitative fit tests are outlinedin detail. All the Appendices are designed to aid the employer in complying with therequirements of the standard. Paragraph (k) of this proposed standard onthe ``communication of MDA hazards to employees'' specifically requiresthat the contents of the standard and Appendices A and B be made availableto affected employees. Information contained in Appendix C on medical surveillanceis to be explained to affected employees. Appendix C also provides informationneeded by the physician to evaluate the results of the medical examination.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (r). Start-Up Dates. </ITAG>The Committee did not establish a section for start up dates. As was donefor effective dates, OSHA based its selection of start-up dates on thefeasibility analysis done by the Committee. <T3>B. OSHA's Findings </T3><ITAG tagnum="81">1. General </ITAG>After consideration of all of the Committee's recommendations, OSHA agreesthat the Committee's recommended standard will significantly reduce thecarcinogenic and toxicological risk to workers exposed from inhalationand dermal exposure to MDA. Furthermore, OSHA recognizes as did the Committeethat all the recommended provisions complement each other by reducing exposurefrom both the dermal and inhalation routes. Protection of workers requiresmore than providing protective equipment to prevent dermal contact or implementingengineering controls to prevent inhalation. Therefore, the Committee'srecommendations contain additional provisions that reduce worker exposurefrom the different exposure routes. These provisions recommended by theCommittee and now proposed by OSHA are similar to those promulgated byOSHA for other toxic substances but have been tailored for the unique characteristicsof MDA. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Specific </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (a). Scope and Application. </ITAG>OSHA finds the Committee's recommendations regarding the intended coverageof their recommended standard acceptable and thus has included these provisionsin this NPRM. OSHA also agrees with the Committee's decision to developa separate standard for the construction industry and OSHA has developeda separate NPRM for construction.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (b). Definitions </ITAG>Except as mentioned below, OSHA finds the Committee's recommended definitionsto be appropriate in that they are either found in other OSHA standards,e.g., ``Director,'' ``Assistant Secretary,'' and ``Authorized person''or are used in accordance with their meanings in general industry. OSHAhas included these definitions in its NPRM. With regard to the Committee's definition of MDA, however, OSHA finds anarrower definition to be appropriate. At 52 FR 26875, the Committee'sdefinition includes an exclusion which reads as follows: ``The definitiondoes not include unreacted MDA, physically bound, such that it is incapableof releasing MDA into the workplace at levels greater than the action levelor posing a dermal absorption hazard''. The Committee's intent, as explainedat 52 FR 26858, however, makes no mention of the emphasized phrase in thedefinition. Furthermore, to propose such a broad exclusion would requireadditional rationale to what was recommended by the Committee. It wouldcreate an exemption not contemplated by the Committee when consideringthe Scope and Application section, the normal area in an OSHA health standardin which to consider exemptions. Looking to the recommended exemptionsin (a) (2) and (3) it is clear that monitoring is required to rely on theformer and a determination of incapability of release based on objectivedata is required in the latter. OSHA believes that the definition shouldbe proposed without the qualifying phrase as indicated above in order forthe proposal to be internally consistent and in order to afford greaterworker protection. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (c). Permissible exposure limits (PELs). </ITAG>1. <T3>Necessity of a TWA and a STEL. </T3>The Committee recommended thatthe employer implement engineering and work practice controls to reduceairborne exposure of MDA to a 10 ppb TWA and a STEL of 100 ppb. OSHA examinedthe necessity of establishing these PELs since most of the exposure appearedto result from dermal contact by workers with MDA. OSHA finds that theCommittee's recommendation in this instance, directly reduces the amountof MDA inhaled as well as the amount available for deposition and ultimatelyabsorption. OSHA believes, however, as did the Committee, that all of the provisionsrecommended by the Committee and now proposed by OSHA are necessary toprotect workers. In particular, OSHA believes that the PELs are necessarycomponents of the proposed standard for the following reasons: 1. The riskfrom inhalation, in itself is significant; 2. Compliance with the PELsresults in a cleaner workplace by reducing the amount of MDA which is airborneand likely to settle on worksurfaces and thus, available for dermal depositionand ultimately absorption; 3. MDA absorption through the palms was overestimatedby the Committee, but absorption through other parts of the body was underestimated;4. The effectiveness of the personal protective equipment is not quantitativelydefined with certainty; therefore, assumptions were made by the Committeeregarding the extent to which the personal protective clothing would preventdermal contact. Without an understanding of the assumptions, the risk estimatesrecommended by the Committee and now proposed by OSHA could give the incorrectappearance that use of gloves provides total protection, and that equallyeffective provisions such as the use of other types of personal protectiveequipment, the PEL and training, provide minimal protection; 5. Assumptionsmade by the Committee regarding the effectiveness of personal protectiveequipment are that the personal protective equipment would be used in aclean workplace with engineering controls for mechanical handling of MDA.Therefore, the personal protective equipment would not be used in excessivelycontaminated environments which would tax the ability of the personal protectiveequipment to prevent dermal contact; 6. Since MDA is difficult to removefrom the skin after contact takes place, the PEL provisions, which decreasethe chance that personal protective equipment will fail and the other industrialprovision of the proposed standard, are necessary. These reasons for requiringa PEL in addition to preventing dermal contact with MDA are explained inmore detail below:andbullet; The Committee employed mathematical models to estimate cancerrisk using ambient sampling data furnished by NIOSH, EPA, and the CMA whichindicated that worker exposures were in the range of 50-70 ppb. Based onthese data, estimates for any primary manufacturing operation where onlyinhalation exposure was considered were expected to produce 1-2 cancersper 1000 exposed workers over a working lifetime. When both inhalationand dermal exposure were considered, the resultant risks were 6-7 per 1000exposed workers. In secondary operations, inhalation exposures of approximately50 ppb were used and the risks were estimated as 1 per 1000 workers exposed.When dermal exposure was considered the risks were escalated to 30 per1000 exposed workers. Although the risks resulting only from dermal exposureare higher than those from inhalation exposure, the Committee determinedthat a considerable risk resulted solely from inhalation exposure. andbullet; The Committee noted that since the initiation of regulatory activityworker exposure has been reduced from those levels reported early by NIOSH,EPA, and CMA. The reductions in exposure were the result of the implementationof engineering controls and work practices. As a result of this observationthe Committee made a series of assumptions regarding ambient and dermalexposure. The Committee assumed that as additional engineering controlswere implemented and the PELs instituted, the amount of MDA in the airand available for deposition and absorption on the upper body, face, hands,neck, head, and forearms would be proporitionately reduced. Since the depositionrates are a function of the amount of MDA in the air, the Committee recommendedthat PELs be set to minimize dermal deposition resulting from fall outof MDA from the air. Although it may appear from observation of the risktables recommended by the Committee and now proposed by OSHA that establishingPELs makes a small contribution to the reduction of risk and the quantifiablebenefits, this is not the case. Reducing airborne concentrations of MDAalso reduces deposition potential. Without establishing PELs, there wouldbe no reason for the employer to maintain ambient concentrations even atthe currently reported levels (which range from 1-41 ppb). Employers mayrelax the use of engineering controls and airborne exposures may returnto past reported levels, and the risk expected from dermal deposition andabsorption would be escalated. Thus, the Committee believed that PELs werenecessary to ensure that an employee's cumulative exposure (dermal andinhalation) was reduced to a level which the Committee believed producedan acceptable risk. andbullet; The Committee's finding that most of the dermal exposure camefrom absorption of MDA through the palm is due, in part, to the assumptionthat no dermal exposure occurs to the lower body. The Committee only estimatedthe risk expected from upper body exposure. If the total body surface areawas used in making risk estimates, the contributions from dermal exposurefrom all body portions except for the palms would be approximately doublethat estimated by the Committee. The Committee, however, lacked lower bodydeposition and absorption data and preferred to be conservative and onlyestimated risk resulting from upper body dermal exposure. Thus, when makingcomparisons of the benefits expected from reducing dermal contact withthe upper body, neck, face, head, and forearms and reducing dermal contactthrough the palms, it should be noted that the calculated risks resultingfrom body parts except for the palm have been underestimated. The Committee made conservative assumptions regarding exposure throughthe palm which result in overestimates of the absorption by the palm. TheCommittee relied on the data generated by Boeninger (Ex. 1. 250) in estimatingdermal dose through the palm. These data are considered ``worst case''or high estimates for several reasons: There were no monitoring data describingpresent day dermal exposure in the eleven industry sectors reviewed. Consequently,baseline data for dermal exposure through the palm were assumed to be thesame as that reported by Boeninger even though these were data which probablyoverestimate exposure. The Committee would have preferred to have recentdermal exposure consistent with recent inhalation data used in the benefitassessment; no consideration was given to the effect implementing engineeringcontrols would have on controlling dermal exposure through the palm; andEstimates are based on using flake, powder, or granular forms of MDA andthese estimates were considered applicable to the handling of liquid formsof MDA. In addition, the Committee was unable to estimate current palm exposurefor the eleven industry sectors. None of the respondents in the Heidensurvey, nor in the ICF site visits had done dermal monitoring for the palms.Since there were no monitoring data, the Committee was unable to developbaseline exposure estimates for any of the eleven industry sectors. TheCommittee attempted to assess the actual ``current'' use of gloves in theeleven industry sectors analyzed. For example, the Committee examined theHeiden Associates' questionnaire regarding current use of gloves by theeleven industry sectors and found that in a few of the sectors, workerswere now required to wear butyl gloves rather than cloth gloves. However,the Committee found that in many of the sectors cloth gloves were stillbeing worn. Thus, the Committee felt it reasonable to assume that the palmexposures reported by Boeninger were adequate to justify its recommendedstandard. The Committee recognized that changes in the use of gloves tothose that prevent skin contact with MDA would result in lower palm exposuresthan those reported by Boeninger. It is for these reasons that the Committeeassumed these estimates to be ``worst case'' exposures which overestimateMDA exposure to the palm.Furthermore, while the Committee was able to assess the effect which theimplementation of engineering controls had made on reducing the ambientexposure levels in the eleven sectors surveyed, the Committee found itdifficult to assess the effect which the implementation of engineeringcontrols had made on reducing dermal exposure. The Committee however, wasaware that the implementation of certain engineering controls did havethe potential to reduce dermal exposure. For example, many of the firmsresponding to the Heiden survey indicated that many of the engineeringcontrols ``currently in place'' consisted of mechanical handling deviceswhich replaced the manual handling of MDA by the workers. None of thesefirms, now using mechanical handling devices, however, had done any dermalmonitoring thus the Committee had to rely on exposure data collected fromestablishments where manual handling rather than mechanical handling wasdone. It could reasonably be assumed that dermal exposure through the palmwould be reduced if MDA were mechanically handled rather than manuallyhandled. Yet, without the monitoring data from operations where mechanicalhandling systems had been installed, the Committee relied on data acquiredthrough monitoring of manual handling operations. Thus, it is safe to saythat the effectiveness that mechanical handling devices have on reducingdermal exposure through the palm has not been adequately assessed. In continuing its analysis, the Committee attempted to determine what typesof MDA were presently being used by the eleven industry sectors. Basedon responses to the Heiden survey, the Committee noted that approximately50% of the respondents were now using liquid forms of MDA rather than powder,flake, or granules. Once again, because data were lacking concerning exposuresresulting from workers handling liquids, the Committee agreed to use theestimates provided by Boeninger, but recognized that these represent ``worstcase'' or high estimates. While OSHA agrees that these data may represent ``worst case'' estimates.OSHA recognizes that this is the ``best available'' evidence and as suchhas incorporated these data into the benefit analysis done by the Agency.andbullet; The effectiveness of different types of personal protective equipmentis not defined with certainty. The Committee needed to make simplifyingassumptions. First, the Committee assumed that there was no personal protectiveequipment for the upper body, head, neck and forearms which would preventtotally dermal absorption. The Committee recognized that to achieve ``nodermal exposure'' through the upper body workers would be required to wearspace suits. This, the Committee felt, would impede their ability to worksafely and as such was considered not feasible. On the other hand, theCommittee assumed that once engineering controls were implemented to achievethe PEL, many of which require mechanical rather than manual handling ofMDA, it was feasible to prevent absorption through the palms by using gloves.The Committee made the assumption that gloves can provide 100% protectionalthough it recognized that there are no standards which can assure 100%effectiveness. Qualitative aids, such as visual monitoring of areas coveredby protective equipment to look for MDA-produced yellow staining of theskin were recommended by the Committee to provide some assurance of theeffective use of this type of personal protective equipment. Nonetheless,since gloves do exist which are impervious to MDA and, if worn properly,can prevent dermal contact through the palms, the Committee assumed 100%effectiveness when gloves are worn. Based on these assumptions, the benefitswere computed. Since exposure through the palms was assumed to be totallypreventable through the use of personal protective equipment, and dermalabsorption for upper body parts was not, the greatest benefit estimatesappear to come from preventing palm exposure. OSHA notes that these assumptions result in an underestimate of the benefitsachievable through preventing upper body absorption. OSHA believes thatthe use of personal protective equipment required by this standard willprevent substantial upper body absorption. OSHA, however, recognizes thatmany of the assumptions which the Committee relied upon represent goodjudgements based on the available data. Thus, OSHA concurs with the assumptionthat upper body absorption will not be totally prevented by the use ofpersonal protective equipment and that estimates of risk should includethe contributions made by these exposures. Furthermore, OSHA agrees thatestablishing standards which reduce the total exposure of workers throughthe implementation of both a PEL and the industrial hygiene provisionswill reduce the hazards associated with upper body dermal absorption tothe extent feasible. andbullet; In the estimates of the amount of MDA absorbed through the palmthe Committee used the exposure estimates provided by Boeinger; contributionswhich ``currently'' in place engineering controls make to preventing palmexposure were not considered. However, when estimating the amount of MDAabsorbed by the upper body, the Committee reduced the upper body depositionby a scaling factor to reflect the contribution which ``currently'' inplace engineering controls make to aiding in the reduction of upper bodydeposition. In addition, the Committee did not try to quantify the effectthat reducing the PEL to 10 ppb would have on palm exposure, although theCommittee's feasibility recommendations for many of the eleven industrysectors include automated material handling. andbullet; As previously stated, the most confounding factor associated withexposure to MDA is that it is not easily removed from the skin. The recordevidence indicates that washing with soap and water only removes 50% ofthe material deposited on the skin. Considering that it takes approximately48 hours for MDA deposited on the skin to be cleared from the body andthat only 50% of the material deposited on the skin can be removed, itwas the Committee's position that dermal absorption should be reduced tothe extent feasible regardless of the source of such exposure. Thus, thisfinding further supported the Committee's recommendation that dermal exposureshould be prevented to the extent feasible. In summary, OSHA agrees with the Committee's recommendation that inhalationand dermal exposure must be reduced to the extent feasible. Further, OSHArecognizes the relationship which exists between dermal deposition andthe PELs and agrees that a combination of engineering controls and workpractices along with stringent standard provisions restricting dermal contactare needed to assure that employees are protected from the effects of occupationalexposure to MDA. OSHA also agrees that the cumulative risk posed by bothinhalation and dermal contact with MDA is significant and that a 10 ppbTWA, a 100 ppb STEL, and the stringent standard provisions being proposedwill reduce the risk. Furthermore, OSHA believes as did the Committee thatmost of the provisions including the use of personal protective equipment,hygiene facilities, exposure monitoring, regulated areas, medical surveillance,employee training, and hazard communication all have been designed to reducethe carcinogenic and toxicological risk posed from inhalation and dermalexposure to MDA. OSHA also believes as did the Committee that the interrelationshipbetween the provisions is so significant that it is really not possibleto quantify the contributions to the reduction of risk expected from eachprovision separately. For example, the use of engineering controls andwork practices results in a clean workplace which minimizes the reentrainmentof MDA into the air and aids in reducing the potential for skin contactby minimizing the accumulation of MDA on work surfaces. The recommendedhousekeeping provision requires, in part, that all surfaces be maintainedas free as practicable of visible accumulations of MDA. This provisionwill directly result in reduced dermal contact contact and will also reducethe possibility of reentrainment into the air. In addition, OSHA recognizesthat the true contribution which engineering controls and work practicesmake in reducing this risk have not been totally quantified. Yet, the costassociated with implementing the engineering and work practice portionsof the standards recommended by the Committee and now proposed by OSHAreflect only 2% of the total compliance costs.(2) <T3>Determining a STEL. </T3>The Committee relied primarily on the Kopelman<T3>et al </T3>data in determining the appropriate STEL. While these computationsmay provide some guidance in establishing a STEL, it should be rememberedthat the series of assumptions which were made to construct these hypotheticaldoses are fraught with problems. It is impossible to    precisely determinefrom the available data what if any ambient level would ensure a workeroccupationally exposed to MDA that exposure would not result in clinicalor subclinical findings of disease resulting from exposure. Further, itis impossible at this point to determine how much MDA must be depositedon the skin to produce clinical signs or symptoms of exposure or to inducechanges in liver function. OSHA's decision to accept the 100 ppb STEL recommended by the Committeewas based largely on the data collected through the survey done by HeidenAssociates which indicated that workers who were exposed at the currentACGIH limit of 100 ppb had not reported any clinical evidence of hepatitisor lost work days resulting from MDA exposure at these levels. OSHA notesthat the data provided by Heiden Associates did not address the additiveeffect dermal exposure had on this worker population nor did the surveyfind that all the reporting workers were equipped with personal protectiveequipment which would prevent dermal contact with MDA. While OSHA may believe that a STEL of 100 ppb may prevent the clinicalobservation of disease, OSHA finds no evidence that occupational exposureto the STEL of 100 ppb may not result in changes in liver function in exposedworkers. OSHA believes, however, that the medical surveillance provisionsalong with the hygiene and personal protective provisions will help toassure the effectiveness of this proposed STEL. OSHA also finds convincing the Committee's argument that the implementationof a STEL will further reduce the carcinogenic risk posed by occupationalexposure to MDA. OSHA accepts the Committee's conclusion that this STEL is feasible andbelieves that the engineering controls needed to achieve a 10 ppb TWA willalso achieve the 100 ppb STEL. OSHA recognizes that while a STEL of 100 ppb is expected to keep the majorityof exposed workers from developing the clinical signs and symptoms of acuteexposure to MDA, acute exposure still might result in biological compromiseor alteration of organ function. Moreover, OSHA is concerned with individualswho are more susceptible to exposure and subsequent disease. OSHA agreeswith the Committee's recommendation and also proposes that a comprehensivemedical surveillance program with sophisticated biological screening toolssuch as liver function testing be used to detect the early developmentof disease in exposed workers before the more advanced clinical manifestationof disease become apparent. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (d). Emergency Situation </ITAG>OSHA based its NPRM on the Committee's recommendation. OSHA finds the Committee'srecommendation to be appropriate for exposure to MDA. OSHA, like the Committee,recognizes that employees exposed to MDA in an emergency situation areat potential risk of death from acute liver intoxication. Thus, OSHA agreesthat requiring written plans and methods to alert employees is needed.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (e). Exposure Monitoring </ITAG>OSHA agrees with the Committee's recommendations for exposure monitoring.OSHA also finds significant the Committee's recommendations that visualmonitoring be included. OSHA recognizes that visual monitoring can providethe employer with an instant determination that personal protective clothinghas lost its effectiveness. OSHA also recognizes that visual monitoringof all potentially exposed body parts may not be feasible. OSHA believesthat the employer will be able to implement this provision to the extentfeasible and that this provision will greatly aid the employer in assuringthat employers are not being exposed, dermally, to MDA. OSHA has clarified the regulatory language recommended by the Committeewith respect to monitoring for the STEL. In the Committee's rationale,it is clear that monitoring for the PELs was intended and that this monitoringwould occur accordingly: (1) Where exposure measurements are determinedto be above the permissible exposure limits (includes both the TWA andthe STEL), the employer is required to monitor every 3 months; (2) whereexposure measurements are above the action level but at or below the PELs(includes both the TWA and the STEL), monitoring is required only at 6month intervals; (3) where exposure measurements are below the action level,monitoring is not required unless there is some change that suggests thatwork place conditions might have changed. The language in the regulatorytext has been changed to reflect the rationale offered by the Committee.OSHA agrees that if a STEL is being recommended that some monitoring scenarioto determine compliance must also be recommended and has been proposedaccordingly. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (f). Regulated Areas </ITAG>OSHA has reviewed the Committee's recommendations for establishing regulatedareas and finds that the tiering of this standard provision is acceptable.In fact, OSHA recognizes that the Committee took considerable effort indeveloping this provision. It was difficult to develop the concept of establishingregulated areas which would restrict inadvertent exposure to unaffectedworkers to liquid mixtures of MDA. Traditionally, OSHA establishes regulatedareas primarily where the PELs are exceeded. Establishing reasonable barriersfor areas where only liquid mixtures are found poses somewhat of a problem,however, OSHA believes that the regulatory text recommended by the Committeeand now proposed by OSHA will allow the employer to reasonably make thenecessary determinations. OSHA did notice that there was some redundancyin the drafting of the Committee's regulatory text and this has been corrected.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (g). Methods of Compliance. </ITAG>OSHA has adopted and included the Committee's recommendations regardingmethods of compliance in its NPRM. OSHA finds that the Committee reliedheavily on OSHA's policy to require feasible engineering and work practicecontrols to prevent excessive employees exposures and to rely on respiratorsonly as an alternative when these other methods are not adequate, not feasible,or have not yet been installed.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (h). Respiratory Protection </ITAG>OSHA has adopted the Committee's recommendations regarding respiratoryprotection and has included these recommendations in its NPRM. OSHA alsoagrees with the Committee recommendation that if OSHA does modify andSection;1910.134 that the respiratory section of this MDA regulation should reflectthese modifications. When andSection; 1910.134 is modified, OSHA will amendthe respiratory section found in this proposed regulation accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (i). Protective Work Clothing and Equipment </ITAG>OSHA has proposed the Committee's recommendation for this paragraph withonly minor changes to eliminate redundancy in the text. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (j). Hygiene Facilities and Practices </ITAG>OSHA accepts the Committee's recommendations for this paragraph and hasincluded them in its NPRM. OSHA did correct an inconsistency in this section.The Committee recommended that employees be required to take showers ator above the action level. The language requiring change rooms was somewhatinconsistent with the Committee's intent for showering provisions, thusOSHA changed the change room provision to correct this inconsistency. Thechange room provision proposed by OSHA requires ``the employer to provideclean change rooms for employees, who must wear protective clothing, ormust use protective equipment because of their exposure to MDA.'' <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (k). Communication of Hazards to Employees </ITAG>OSHA accepts the Committee's recommendations for this paragraph exceptthat OSHA has removed what is perceived as a redundancy. The Committeerecommended the use of ``suspect cancer hazard'' and ``may cause cancer''both in the signs and labelling requirements. OSHA believes that only oneof these terms is necessary and will include the term ``may cause cancer''in its signs and labelling requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (l). Housekeeping </ITAG>OSHA reviewed the Committee's recommendations for this paragraph and hasbased its housekeeping provisions on the Committee's recommendations. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (m). Medical Surveillance </ITAG>OSHA reviewed the recommendations made by the Committee regarding medicalsurveillance and has, for the most part, used these recommendations inparagraph (m) of its NPRM. Clearly, there is a need for medical surveillance.First, while the recommended standard now proposed by OSHA is anticipatedto be adequate to prevent employees being adversely affected as a resultof occupational exposure to MDA, OSHA finds it impossible to preciselydetermine from the available data what if any ambient level would ensurea worker occupationally exposed to MDA that exposure would not result inclinical or subclinical findings of disease. Further, it is impossibleat this time to determine how much MDA must be deposited on the skin toproduce clinical signs or symptoms of exposure or to induce changes inliver function. Thus, while OSHA may believe that a STEL of 100 ppb anda TWA of 10 ppb may prevent the clinical observation of disease, OSHA findsno evidence that occupational exposure to these PELs may not result inchanges in liver function, a subtle indicator of disease, in exposed workersand it is for these reasons that OSHA has proposed a comprehensive medicalsurveillance program. OSHA also believes that the medical surveillanceprovisions along with the hygiene and personal protective provisions willhelp to assure the effectiveness of these proposed PELs. Second, even if the PELs were sufficiently protective, OSHA believes thatthe medical surveillance program is also part of this standard's comprehensiveapproach to prevention of MDA related diseases. Its purpose is to supplementthe standard's primary mechanisms of disease prevention, the eliminationor reduction of airborne concentrations of MDA and sources of dermal exposure,by facilitating the early detection of medical effects associated withexposure to MDA. Control of MDA exposure below the TWA and STEL and theprevention of dermal contact will protect most workers from the adverseeffects of MDA exposure, but may not be satisfactory to protect individualworkers (1) from the carcinogenic potential posed by MDA, (2) from thehepatotoxic effects of exposure to MDA, (3) who have additional uncontrolledsources of MDA exposure or exposure to liver toxins (e.g., non-occupational),(4) who exhibit abnormal variation in MDA absorption rates, or (5) whohave specific medical conditions which could be aggravated by MDA exposure(liver disease). In addition, control systems may fail or hygiene and respiratorprograms may be inadequate, and periodic medical surveillance of individualworkers may help detect those failures. Third, while human data indicate that clinical signs and symptoms of diseaseappear to be reversible, there are no data which describe the effect thatchronic low dosing or acute dosing will have on target organs. The onlyscreening tool which is capable of detecting changes in biological processesprior to the manifestation of the disease (evidenced by clinical signsand symptoms) is the liver function test. Liver function testing, whilea screening tool for detecting abnormalities, is also a sensitive indicatorof the biological decay of the liver. The question of what effect continuedexposure will have on the cell repair or cell reproductive capabilitiesis not known with certainity. Given the severity of the disease and thefact that changes in liver function are often times indications of diseaserather than of the incipiation of disease, the implementation of a medicalsurveillance program is warranted. OSHA believes that the use of the liver function test is an indicator ofthese subtle changes in liver function and that these tests can be usedto indicate that adverse effects from MDA exposure have occurred. It wasthe Committee's opinion that a qualified physician equipped with the baselinedata on a particular worker would be able to determine what is normal orabnormal. Local laboratories provide statistical variations for baselineliver function testing and a physician armed with the employee specificdata could make the proper diagnosis. OSHA finds that the liver functiontest is presently the best indicator of MDA induced hepatotoxicity. Fourth, OSHA is concerned with the Committee's seeming failure to recommendsensitive detection testing for bladder cancer, since the Committee clearlyfelt that a reduction of the carcinogenic risk posed by MDA was essential.In fact, originally OSHA's considerations for medical surveillance includedcytology testing to detect bladder cancer. The Committee was reluctantto recommend cytology testing because of the negative reports on the sensitivityof the testing procedures. Also this testing was extremely costly and veryworker invasive. More recently, however, a bladder cancer test requiringonly the examination of the cells found in the urine for genetic changein order to determine if bladder cancer has developed has been utilitzed.This testing is less invasive than older technologies and if at all accuratecould effectively be used. OSHA is unable to make findings regarding the applicability of using bladdercancer testing. OSHA does not propose bladder cancer testing in its NPRMbut wou1d ask for public comment concerning the appropriateness of requiringsuch testing. OSHA also agrees with the Committee's rationale that a properlyfunctioning medical surveillance program, even without requiring specificcancer testing, will nonetheless provide some early cancer detection asa result of the routine examinations requirements. In addition, these routineexaminations will also provide for detection of other conditions whichmight be aggravated as a result of MDA exposure. Finally, the Secretary's authority to require medical surveillance in thisproposed standard is supported by section 6(b)(7) of the Act, which readsin pertinent part:<ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, where appropriate, any such standard shall prescribethe type and frequency of medical examinations or other tests which shallbe made available, by the employer or at his cost, to employees exposedto such hazards in order to most effectively determine whether the healthof such employees is adversely affected by such exposure.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Addition statutory support is found in the general rulemaking authoritygranted in section 8(g)(2) of the Act. This section empowers the secretary``to prescribe such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary to carryout (his) responsibilities under the Act''_in this case as part of, orancillary to, a section 6(b) standard. The Secretary's responsibilitiesunder the Act are defined largely by its enumerated purposes, which include,among other things, exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishingcausal connections between diseases and work in environmental conditions* * *. (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(6)). The Committee recommended, at 52 FR 26864,that all medical examinations of employees be given at a reasonable timeand place. It is necessary, the Committee reasoned, that the examinationsbe convenient and be provided without loss of pay to the employee to ensureemployee participation. While this recommendation appeared in the Summaryand Explanation section of the Committee document, the recommended languageof the standard, probably as an oversight, does not reflect this requirement.OSHA finds, based on this discussion of the Committee's standard that theCommittee unintentionally omitted this requirement from its standard andtherefore, seeing obvious merit, adopts this requirement in this NPRM atparagraph (m)(1)(ii). On September 27, 1988, OSHA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,``Medical Surveillance Programs for Employees'' (53 FR 37595). This ANPRraised for public comment several issues related to the need for and contentof a generic medical surveillance standard. OSHA announced in the ANPRthat it ``has initiated an evaluation of the effectiveness of medical monitoringand surveillance requirements in existing OSHA standards, in order to determinewhat has worked and what has not worked in practice, and if these requirementscould be improved.'' In this proposal, OSHA requests comment on the appropriateness of and needfor such an evaluation for the medical surveillance provisions of the MDAstandard, and on the methodology by which an evaluation could be conducted.Following is a discussion of the reasons why an evaluation would be beneficial,but difficult to conduct. The primary objectives of such an evaluation would be to determine if workerswho have been protected according to the requirements of this standardhave exhibited adverse health effects that may be related to MDA exposureand to determine whether or not workers may develop diseases that may beexacerbated by MDA exposures that may not otherwise adversely affect them.Thus, it may be possible to determine if the information obtained throughthe medical surveillance program is useful to employers for detecting deficienciesin workplace protection and for identifying individuals who may be at greaterrisk of developing MDA related disease. Such an evaluation may be particularlyappropriate for substances such as MDA. Although studies show that MDAcauses liver damage, the incidence of liver damage that may occur fromMDA exposure at or below the PEL is not certain. Liver function tests,which would be required by the proposed standard, are capable of detectingliver impairment. OSHA believes, however, that an evaluation of the medicalsurveillance program will be definitive only if extensive data are gatheredfor many years and after evaluation through epidemiological methods. Suchan effort may impose extensive resource burdens on the employers and OSHA.If an adequate evaluation could be conducted, and the results indicatethat forms of liver toxicity were identified, OSHA could use the resultsto reconsider the standard to determine if further protection is warranted.On the other hand, if an evaluation shows that the information collectedthrough the medical surveillance program has not been useful in identifyingworkers with adverse health effects related to MDA exposure, then OSHAcould reconsider the program to determine whether it should be modifiedor deleted. Such an evaluation may show that the medical surveillance provisionsare working and that there is no need to change an acceptable practice,or may show that worker protection could be improved through the promulgationof a more stringent standard. In addition to an evaluation of the overall medical surveillance program,a specific evaluation could be conducted for one or more individual provisionsof the standard. For example, an evaluation could assess the requirementfor multiple physician review or the adequacy of the removal period requiredby the medical removal provision. An evaluation such as this would notallow the agency to determine if MDA-exposed employees were at higher riskof adverse health effects due to MDA exposures, but would allow the agencyto determine if specific provisions are giving the employers the informationneeded to make the right decisions about employee protection. As a general matter, OSHA believes that evaluations of OSHA's programsare necessary functions to ensure that OSHA is effectively accomplishingits mandate. Therefore, OSHA requests comments on whether an evaluationshould be performed on the medical surveillance provisions of the MDA standard.If an evaluation is recommended, OSHA requests that the commenter stipulatea hypothesis for the evaluation and provide protocols for its conduct andanalysis. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (n) Recordkeeping </ITAG>OSHA has reviewed the Committee's recommendations and has used their recommendationsas the basis for its NPRM.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (o) Observation of Monitoring </ITAG>OSHA has reviewed the Committee's recommendations and has used their recommendationsas the basis for its NPRM. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (p) Effective Dates </ITAG>The Committee did not establish a section for effective dates. However,the Committee did not indicate in any of its feasibility findings thatany specific time would be needed to comply with the implementation ofany of the recommended standards. Thus OSHA has developed its effectivedate section based on the feasibility analysis recommended by the Committee.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (q) Appendices </ITAG>Five appendices have been included at the end of this proposed standard.Appendices A, B, C, and D have been included primarily for purposes ofinformation. None of the statements contained in Appendices A, B, C, andD should be construed as establishing a mandatory requirement not otherwiseimposed by the standard, or as detracting from an obligation which thestandard does impose. However, the protocols for respiratory fit testingin Appendix E are mandatory. Appendix A contains information on the description and exposure levelsof MDA. Also provided in Appendix A is information on the health hazardsassociated with exposure, descriptions of protective clothing and equipment,emergency and first aid procedures, medical requirements, provisions forthe observation of monitoring, access to exposure and medica1 records,and precautions for the safe use, handling, and storage of MDA. Appendix B contains ``substance technical guidelines'' for MDA, includingphysical and chemical data, spill and leak procedures, including wastedisposal methods, and other miscellaneous precautions for the safe handlingof MDA. Appendix C contains the medical surveillance guidelines for MDA. Includedin these guidelines are the description of the routes of entry, the toxicologyand symptoms and signs associated with MDA exposure, information on thetreatment of acute toxic effects, and surveillance and preventive considerations,including hematology guidelines which may be useful to physicians in conductingthe medical surveillance program required by paragraph (m) of this recommendedstandard. Appendix D gives details of the recommended sampling and analytical methodsfor use in monitoring employee exposures to MDA. Appendix E gives detailed fit testing procedures that are to be followedfor qualitative or quantitative fit testing of negative pressure respirators.Various protocols for qualitative and quantitative fit tests are outlinedin detail. All the Appendices are designed to aid the employer in complying with therequirements of the standard. Paragraph (k) of this proposed standard onthe ``communication of MDA hazards to employees'' specifically requiresthat the contents of the standard and Appendices A and B be made availableto affected employees. Information contained in Appendix C on medical surveillanceis to be explained to affected employees. Appendix C also provides informationneeded by the physician to evaluate the results of the medica1 examination.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (r) Start-Up Dates </ITAG>The Committee did not establish a section for start-up dates. As was donefor effective dates, OSHA based its selection of start-up dates on thefeasibility analysis done by the Committee. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Summary and Explanation of the Standard for the ConstructionIndustry </ITAG>(a) Committee's Recommendations <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (a) Scope and Application </ITAG>The Committee unanimously recommended a separate standard for occupationalexposure to MDA in the construction industry. The Committee also agreedto use andSection; 1910.12(b) to define ``construction work'' as work forconstruction, alteration, and/or repair, including painting and decorating.The Committee recommended that their proposed standard apply to all constructionwork as defined in 29 CFR 1910.12(a), which states:<ITAG tagnum="21">The standards prescribed in Part 1926 of this chapter are adoptedas occupational safety and health standards under section 6 of the Actand shall apply, according to the provisions thereof, to every employmentand place of employment of every employee engaged in construction work.</ITAG>Accordingly, the recommended standard applies to all occupational exposuresto MDA in the construction industry. Depending on the nature and extentof exposure, certain provisions of the recommended standard rule may notbe applicable in certain situations or may have limited applicability.The applicability of many provisions of the standard is based on the resultsof initial employee monitoring conducted by the employer or on the availabilityof other objective data concerning employee exposures or product characteristics.The construction operations listed in paragraph (a) include construction,alteration, repair, maintenance, or renovation of structures, substrates,or portions thereof that contain MDA; the installation or finishing ofsurfaces with MDA containing products; the removal of MDA spills or emergencyclean-up on site; and transportation, disposal, or storage of contaminatedproducts. MDA spill and emergency situations are included within the scope of thestandard, because these events clearly have the potential for serious employeeand bystander exposures. MDA spills might occur during the handling ofbags or containers of MDA-containing materials to be used at the constructionsite. The final group of activities listed in the scope and applicationparagraph includes the transportation, disposal, storage, or containmentof MDA or MDA-containing products on the worksites at which constructionoperations occur. These operations are included because they have considerablepotential for excessive employee exposure to MDA, and, if not closely supervisedand properly conducted, may lead to serious bystander exposure as well.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has specific requirements forthe disposal of hazardous waste, and the MDA standard contemplates compliancewith EPA provisions for the safe disposal and handling of MDA-containingwastes and of MDA-contaminated clothing. The Committee notes that the recommended standard has been carefully structuredto relate the stringency of the requirements to the extent and durationof employee exposures. The Committee therefore believes that a complianceburden will not be placed on construction employers who either do not use,handle, or remove MDA-containing products or who maintain MDA exposuresin their workplaces at levels below the action level or where the likelihoodof dermal exposure does not exist. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (b). Definitions </ITAG>Paragraph (b) of the recommended MDA standard for the construction industrydefines a number of terms used in the standard. In some instances, thedefinitions used are consistent with those of other OSHA standards andthose recommended by the Committee to be used in the general industry standard,e.g., ``Director,'' ``Assistant Secretary,'' and ``Authorized person.''However, certain other terms require definition because they are used inaccordance with their meanings in the construction industry. <T3>Action level </T3>is defined as one half of the PEL. If employers areengaged in MDA work causing worksite levels of MDA above the action levelfor 30 or more days per year, they must also institute a medical surveillanceprogram for all employees. In addition, on sites where food and beveragesare consumed and the airborne MDA level exceeds the PEL, the standard requiresemployers to provide lunch areas that have airborne MDA levels below theaction level. <T3>EmpIoyee exposure </T3>is defined as that exposure to airborne MDAthat would occur if the employee were not using respiratory protectiveequipment. The Committee believes it is essential to determine employeeexposure levels without the use of respiratory protection in order to gaugethe efficacy of mandated work practice and engineering controls. <T3>Regulated areas </T3>are defined as areas where airborne concentrationsof MDA exceed or can reasonably be expected to exceed the permissible exposurelimit or where the potential for dermal exposure exists. The fact thatthe recommended standard contains requirements for two types of regulatedareas reflects both the wide differences in construction worksites andthe Committee's approach in dealing with this wide range in exposure conditions.These two types of regulated areas thus reflect the recommended standard'suse of the ``tiering'' concept: increasing regulatory stringency with increasinghazard. <T3>Competent person </T3>is a term and concept widely used and recognizedin the construction field. The recommended proposal definition of a competentperson as one who is capable of identifyinq existing MDA hazards in theworkplace and who has the authority to take prompt corrective measuresto eliminate them is consistent with the definition in 29 CFR 1926.32(f),OSHA's safety and health standards for the construction industry. The terms ``clean room,'' ``equipment room,'' and ``high-efficiency particulateair (HEPA) filter'' are self-explanatory and refer to hygiene areas andequipment storage areas used in the construction industry. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (c) PermissibIe Exposure Limit </ITAG>The Committee recommends that the PEL for the construction industry beset at 10 parts of MDA per billion parts of air as an 8-hour time-weightedaverage (TWA) limit and at 100 ppb as a STEL. This is consistent with therecommended standard for general industry. The recommendations contained in the Committee's proposed standard aresupported by the Committee's findings that occupationa1 exposure to MDAunder current occupational conditions poses a risk to the health of employeesand that the proposed standard, if adopted, can achieve a reduction inthat risk. The Committee determined in its quantitative risk assessment(Ex. 9, Section IV) that lifetime exposure to an 8-hour TWA of 250 ppbin spray operations would result in 9.25 excess deaths due to cancer perthousand workers. For roll-on operations, the lifetime risk at an exposurelevel of 20 ppb would be 2.25 cancers per thousand workers.As with the recommended standard for general industry, the recommendedstandard for construction establishes a ceiling or short-term exposurelimit of 100 ppb (sampled over a 15-minute period) for MDA.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (d) Communication Among Employers</ITAG>Paragraph (d) of the recommended rule requires that, on multi-employerconstruction worksites, employers performing MDA work requiring the establishmentof a regulated area inform other employers on the site of the nature oftheir work with MDA and of the existence of and requirements pertainingto regulated areas. The Committee recognizes that several different operationsinvolving workers from numerous trades may simultaneously take place onthe same construction site and that the exposures of these workers to MDAshould be minimized to the extent possible. The Committee believes thatrequiring employers who are directly involved in MDA-related activitiesto inform other employers working nearby on a multi-employer worksite ofthe existence of hazardous levels of MDA, regulated areas, and the rulespertaining to such areas will contribute substantially to the protectionof these nearby employees. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (e) Emergency Situations </ITAG>The Committee agreed that available health data suggest that elevated short-termexposure to MDA should be viewed with concern. The Committee believed thatan unexpected high exposure must be viewed as an emergency situation. Awritten plan would be required where there is a possibility of an emergencyand procedures for alerting employees in the event that an emergency occurs.The recommended provisions also include a requirement to alert employeesother than those who have the potential to be directly exposed in an emergencysituation. Such employees may be employees from neighboring work siteswho may inadvertently approach the emergency site. They may also includeemployees from other work shifts or employees who may be later exposedto work surfaces or equipment contaminated as a result of the emergency.The Committee also recommended the development of a written plan for eachworkplace where there is a possibility of an emergency. The plan shallinclude the elements prescribed in 29 CFR 1910.38, ``Employee emergencyplans and fire prevention plans.''The Committee believes that the performance language of the emergency situationparagraph will give employers the flexibility to choose any effective methodof alerting employees, including communications systems, voice communication,or a bell or other alarm. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (f). Exposure Monitoring </ITAG>The recommended standard also requires that the employers conduct monitoringto determine employee exposures to MDA. The recommended standard requiresinitial determinations of employee exposures using frequencies and patternsof monitoring sufficient to represent with reasonable accuracy the exposuresof employees. The standard would also require that monitoring be conductedno less frequently than once every 3 months if MDA exposure exceeds thePELs and once every 6 months if exposure is between the action level andthe PELs. Moreover, section 6(b)(7) of the Act mandates that standardspromulgated shall, where appropriate, ``provide for monitoring or measuringemployee exposures at such locations and intervals. and in such a manneras may be necessary for the protection of employees'' (29 U.S.C. 655(b)(7)).Based on the recommendations made by CACOSH in the Asbestos rulemaking,and the requirements of the Act, the Committee recommends that the constructiontrades be required to do the same sort of monitoring required to be doneby the general industry sectors. Accordingly, the recommended standard for construction includes severalmonitoring requirements, i.e., employers must perform monitoring of theiremployees' breathing zones that will accurately reflect and be representativeof their exposures to MDA. In paragraph (f)(2). construction employersare required to conduct initial monitoring of employee exposures, unless:(1) The employer can demonstrate, on the basis of objective data, thatthe MDA-containing product or material being handled cannot cause exposuresabove the standard's action level, even under worst-case release conditions;or (2) the employer has historical or other data demonstrating that exposureson a particular job will be below the action level. Periodic monitoringis addressed in paragraph (f)(3), which stipulates that employers whoseMDA operations are being conducted within a regulated area forego periodicmonitoring if the employees are all wearing supplied-air respirators whileworking in the regulated area. Monitoring may be terminated when, in accordancewith paragraph (f)(4), employers obtain confirmation by means of periodicmonitoring that their employees' exposures are below the action level.Paragraph (f)(5) sets forth the accuracy and precision requirements forthe sampling methodology selected by the employer. The requirements inparagraphs (f)(6) and (f)(7) pertain to requirements for employee notificationof monitoring results and to observation of monitoring, respectively. Although employers are required to determine the exposure of each employeeexposed to MDA, this determination is not required to be based on separatemeasurements taken for each employee. Instead, the recommended standardpermits employers to use a ``representative'' measurement to characterizethe exposures of more than one employee when these employees perform essentiallythe same job under the same conditions. For these types of situations,it may be sufficient for the employer to monitor one or a few of theseemployees to obtain data that are ``representative'' of the exposure ofthe remaining employees in the group. As permitted in paragraph (f)(l)(iii),representative personal sampling for employees engaged in similar workand exposed to similar concentrations of MDA can be achieved by measuringthe exposure of that member of the exposed group who can reasonably beexpected to have the highest exposure and then attributing this exposurelevel to the remaining employees in the group. In many work situations, this representative monitoring approach may bemore cost-effective than individual monitoring of all employees to determinethe exposures of affected employees. However, employers are free to useany monitoring approach that will correctly identify the breathing-zoneexposures of their employees to airborne MDA. Paragraph (f)(2)(i) of the recommended rule contains requirements for initialmonitoring for construction employees exposed to MDA. In this paragraphOSHA requires employers to conduct initial monitoring at the srart of eachnew MDA job in order to assess the effectiveness of existing engineeringcontrols and to provide intormation necessary for the proper selectionof appropriate respirators. The Committee believes that initial monitoring is essential for protectingemployee health because it provides the employer with information for determiningthe necessity for using engineering controls, instituting or modifyingwork practices, and selecting appropriate respiratory protection. Recognizingthe varied nature of construction projects, the Committee has requiredthat initial monitoring for employee exposures be conducted at the startof each new construction project that involves the handling of MDA-containingmaterials. Paragraph (f)(2) allows employers to dispense with initial monitoring ifthey can demonstrate by means of objective data that MDA-containing productsor material cannot release airborne MDA in concentrations exceeding theaction level. The Committee believes that employers may be able to obtaindata from the manufacturers of MDA-containing products that demonstratethat these materials will not release MDA at levels that exceed the actionlevel, even under worst case conditions. This exemption would relieve employersfrom monitoring when employees are handling MDA containing products thatare not capable of releasing a signiflcant amount of MDA. The Committee also has included in paragraph (f)(2) an exemption from initialmonitoring for employers who have historical monitoring data. The Committeeincluded this exemption in recognition of the fact that many employersare currently conducting exposure monitoring on construction sites; thisexemption would prevent these employers from having to repeat monitoringactivity for construction jobs that are substantially similar to previousjobs for which monitoring was conducted. However, such monitoring data must have been obtained from projects conductedby the employer that meet the following conditions: (1) The data upon which judgments are based are scientifically sound andcollected using methods that are sufficiently accurate and precise. (2) The processes and work practices in use when the historical data wereobtained are essentially the same as those to be used during the job forwhich initial monitoring will not be performed. (3) The characteristics of the MDA-containing material being handled whenthe historical data were obtained are the same as those on the job forwhich initial monitoring will not be performed.(4) Environmental conditions prevailing when the historical data were obtainedare the same as for the job for which initial monitoring will not be performed.Thus, the Committee agrees that employers should be encouraged to compileand use any information that will aid in the protection of workers' health.Furthermore, the Committee would recommend the use of such data in lieuof initial monitoring if information from the data base is available andsufficiently detailed to meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(ii)for historical data. Like the recommended general industry standard, the recommended constructionstandard requires employers to notify employees of their exposure levelsand to provide employees exposed to MDA an opportunity to observe any airsampling being performed in accordance with the standard; designated employeerepresentatives must also be given this opportunity. The recommended standardfurther specifies that such observers be provided with and required towear any protective clothing and equipment required by the standard. These provisions are consistent with section 8(c) of the Act, which requiresemployers to permit employees or their representatives to observe any requiredmonitoring and to notify employees of their monitoring results. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (g). Regulated Areas </ITAG>The recommended standard requires that signs be posted to alert employeesto the existence of areas where the PELs are exceeded or where the likelihoodof dermal exposure exists. Paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) require that theregulated area be demarcated in a manner that restricts entry to the areato authorized persons only. Respirators must be supplied to persons enteringregulated areas as specified in paragraphs (g)(1)(iv) and (g)(2)( iv),and eating, drinking, smoking, and applying cosmetics are prohibited insuch areas by paragraphs (g)(1)(v) and (g)(2)(v). These requirements areconsistent with similar provisions in previous OSHA standards (Acrylonitrile,29 CFR 1910.1045; lnorganic Arsenic, 29 CFR 1910.1018; Ethylene Oxide,29 CFR 1910.1047; and Vinyl Chloride, 29 CFR 1910.1047) and with the Committee'srecommendations for a general industry standard regulating occupationalexposure to MDA. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (h). Methods of Compliance </ITAG>The recommended standard governing occupational exposure to MDA requiresthat a combination of engineering controls, work practices be used to meetthe exposure limits contained in the standard. The engineering controlmethods outlined in the standard include isolation, enclosure, exhaustventilation, and dust collection. Work practices were also recognized asnecessary for maintaining exposures at or below the PELs. The effectiveness of local exhaust ventilation systems that are equippedwith HEPA-filtered dust collection systems was recommended for use in thegeneral industry standards and are likewise being recommended for use inthe construction industry. The Committee believes that general exhaust ventilation systems may alsobe effective in reducing employee exposure to MDA in construction. Suchsystems are useful for reducing the concentration of MDA-containing materialsand removing potentially harmful MDA particulates from the air througha HEPA filtration system. OSHA cautions employers, however, that the useof general exhaust ventilation will tend to spread MDA airborne contaminantsunless the return air is passed through a HEPA filter. Vacuum cleaners that are equipped with HEPA filters are effective controlsfor cleaning MDA spills and performing clean-up, since the HEPA-filteredvacuum systems collect MDA containing material and prevent it from becomingairborne. Isolation of operations where MDA-containing materials are being appliedto surfaces during construction activities is an effective means of containingexposures. The prompt disposal of MDA-containing materials in leak-tight containerscan be an effective work practice because MDA-containing materials sealedin disposal containers while they are still wet are less likely to posea dermal exposure problem. The Committee, in the feasibility recommendations, also noted the significancewhich respiratory use had in controlling worker exposure to MDA resultingfrom spray application. In fact, the Committee found that in this instancefor the most part a properly selected and functioning respirator servedas the only feasible control for separating the worker from his environment.The Committee provided considerable discussion concerning this recommendation,however, the results of their findings are not reflected in the Committee'srecommended regulatory text. The Committee also recommended that spray application of MDA be prohibited.As recognized application of MDA through spray techniques would resultin the potential for very high worker exposures. However, the Committeelater changed this recommendation to allow the application of MDA throughspray application. OSHA has also proposed the use of MDA through sprayapplication. Further, the Committee recommended that compressed air not be used to removeMDA-containing materials. Using compressed air to clean MDA dust from surfacesresults in the formation of large dust clouds that lead to excessive exposuresof the worker and bystanders unless local exhaust ventilation is used.There was no indication, however, that using compressed air to blow MDA-containingdust from surfaces was a current practice. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (i). Respiratory Protection </ITAG>The recommended standard for the construction industry requires that employersprovide respirators at no cost to employees (1) During the interval necessary to install or implement feasible engineeringand work practice controls; (2) In operations such as maintenance and repair activities for which engineeringand work practice controls are not feasible; (3) In work situations where feasible engineering and work practice controlsare not yet sufficient to reduce exposure to or below the PELs; and (4) In emergencies. Employers are required under paragraph (i)(2) of the revised rule to selectappropriate respirators based on employee exposure levels that exist inthe workplace. The required respirators range from half-mask air-purifyingrespirators equipped with high-efficiency filters for concentrations thatdo not exceed 10 times the PEL, to full-facepiece supplied-air respiratorsor SCBA when the concentration of MDA exceeds 1000 times the PEL. Employersare required to select respirators from those that are approved jointlyby the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the MineSafety and Health Administration under the provisions of 30 CFR Part 11.In addition, employers are required to provide powered air-purifying respiratorsat the request of employees whenever such a respirator will provide adequateprotection for the concentration existing in the workplace.Under paragraph (i)(3), employers are required to institute a RespiratoryProtection program as required under 29 CFR 1910.134. The required programis to include (1) Criteria for changing filter elements for air-purifyingrespirators, (2) a policy permitting employees time to leave work areasto wash their faces and respirator facepieces to prevent skin irritation,and (3) a policy for reassigning employees to other jobs if a physiciandetermines that the employee cannot function normally while wearing a respirator.Under paragraph (i)(5), the recommended standard requires that employersconduct qualitative or quantitative fit testing for all employees requiredto wear a negative-pressure respirator. The requirements for the use, selection,program elements, and fit testing of respirators are the same as thosecontained in the general industry standard. The Committee agreed that this respirator section, like the respiratorysection recommended in the general industry standard would be revised whenOSHA revised its respiratory protection standard found in andSection; 1910.134.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (j). Protective Clothing </ITAG>The recommended construction standard, like the general industry standard,requires that all workers exposed to MDA be provided with personal protectiveclothing and equipment: i.e., coveralls, aprons, gloves, boot covers, andgoggles. The Committee has recommended stringent provisions for the useof personal protective clothing because of the hazards associated withdermal absorption of MDA or MDA-containing materials. When nondisposableprotective clothing is used, the employer is required by paragraph (j)(2)to launder the clothing in a manner that prevents the release of airborneMDA in excess of the PEL and to notify the person responsible for laundering.Paragraph (j)(3) requires employers to transport contaminated clothingin sealed impermeable bags or other impermeable containers. The requirementsof paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(3) are identical to the requirements of thegeneral industry standard. In addition, a requirement has been included that the personal protectiveequipment worn by employees be examined periodically to detect rips ortears, and that when rips or tears are detected in clothing they must beimmediately mended, or the worksuit must be immediately replaced. In addition, the Committee would recommend that disposable work suits beused by construction workers handling MDA or MDA-containing products. TheCommittee believes that this type of clothing provides sufficient protectionto the worker but eliminates the problems that may be involved in launderingand storing MDA-contaminated clothing on non-fixed work sites. The Committeerecognizes that while disposable overalls may not be as durable and comfortableas cotton work clothes, they do not require laundering which would exposeanother workforce or the worker's family to MDA. The Committee, however,believes that non-disposable work clothes similar ro those required inthe revised general industry standard will provide sufficient protectionfor employees engaged in construction activities, provided that such clothingis properly cleaned after work and then laundered. The Committee, however,chose to propose performance language in its regulatory text which wouldallow the employer to chose the clothing which is appropriate. The Committee also recognizes that heat stress is a concern when disposableprotective clothing is used in hot environments. However, the use of protectiveclothing is necessary to protect employees from MDA exposure that may resultfrom contaminated clothing. In situations in which heat stress is a concern,the Committee believes that employers should use appropriate work-restregimens and provide heat stress monitoring that includes measuring employees'heart rates, body temperatures, and weight loss. If such measures are usedto conrrol heat stress, disposable protective clothing can be safely wornto provide the needed protection against MDA exposure. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (k). Hygiene Facilities and Practices </ITAG>The hygiene facilities requirements of the recommended construction standardare similar to those recommended in the general industry standard. Forexample, exposure to MDA at levels above the action level acts as the triggerfor the shower provisions. All workers required to wear personal protectiveequipment must have a place to change their street clothes and to storethem separately from their work clothes. Paragraph (k)(1)(i) of the recommended construction standard modifies thelanguage of the recommended general industry standard to allow change ``areas,''in recognition of the fact that the place where employees change from streetclothing to work clothing and back again to street clothing is not alwaysa separate room but may be merely a separate area of a larger space. Thisdifference recognizes that it may not be feasible at some constructionsites to provide a separate room with physical barriers. In these instances,employers may provide change areas that are distant from the immediatelocation where MDA-related work is being conducted, such as on a separatefloor of a building. The Committee also recommends that the term ``separate storage facilities''be used in recognition of the fact the employers must use portable storagefacilities that can be transported from job to job. The Committee's intentin this provision is to ensure that street clothes are sufficiently separatedfrom work and protective clothing and equipment in order to prevent contaminationof employees' street clothing, and this can be accomplished by separatelockers, baskets, or other containers. New language has been added in the recommended standard to require theprovision of clean areas: <T3>i.e., </T3>areas that have airborne concentrations of MDA below theaction level, where employees may consume food or beverages on site. Thisaddition was recommended by CACOSH in its 1980 report (Ex. 84-233). CACOSHrecognized that permanent lunch rooms, such as exist on fixed worksites,were probably not feasible for the construction industry, due to the nonfixednature of construction project worksites. The term ``lunch area'' was adoptedby OSHA to indicate that a temporary facility, such as a separate trailer,would serve the purpose of protecting employee health. The Committee agreeswith both 0SHA's and CACOSH's findings that the transient work conditionsin nonfixed workplaces would make the installation of fixed lunchroomsdifficult, and accordingly included a requirement for clean lunch areasin its recommended standard. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (l). Communication of MDA Hazards to Employees </ITAG>In paragraph (l) of the recommended standard, the Committee has includedrequirements to ensure that the dangers of MDA-containing materials arecommunicated to employees by means of signs, labels, and employee informationand training. The requirements for the signs and labels mandated in thissection parallel those in OSHA's Hazard Communication standard (29 CFR1910.1200).(1) <T3>Signs and Labels. </T3>The Committee recommends that the constructionstandard include specifications for signs to be posted at all locationswhere regulated areas have been established to indicate that concentrationsof airborne MDA exceed the PEL or where the likelihood of dermal exposureexists; such signs are to bear the same legend as that recommended in thegeneral industry standard. The purpose of such signs is to minimize the number of employees in a regulatedarea by alerting them to the fact that they must have authorization fromtheir employer and take the appropriate protective measures before entering.Furthermore, as discussed in the Summary and Explanation for the recommendedstandard for general industry signs serve to apprise employees of the hazardsto which they are exposed in the course of their employment, and fostercooperation between the employee and employer in controlling workplacehazards. The standard also requires that all MDA products and containers of MDAproducts, including waste containers, be labeled with appropriate informationand with a warning statement against inhalation or dermal contact withMDA. These labelling requirements are consistent with those found in 1910.1200.(2) <T3>Employee Information and Training. </T3>The recommended training requirementsare consistent with those found in 1910.1200, except that annual trainingis recommended in both the general industry and construction standards.The recommended standard requires that training be provided to all employeesprior to or at the time of initial assignment and at least yearly thereafter.Component areas to be covered in the training program include: (1) Methodsfor recognizing MDA; (2) the health effects associated with MDA exposure;(3) the importance of necessary protective measures to minimize exposureincluding, as applicable, engineering controls, work practices, respirators,housekeeping and protective clothing, and any necessary instruction inthe use of these controls; (4) the purpose, proper use, fitting instructions,and limitations of respirators, as described in 29 CFR 1910.134; (5) theappropriate work practices for performing the MDA related job; and (6)the medical surveillance program requirements. The employer may designand implement his own training program that contains these elements, orrely on third-party training programs. The Committee strongly believed that informing and training employees canreduce the incidence of work-related diseases caused by exposure to hazardousworkplace conditions. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (m). Housekeeping </ITAG>The recommended standard for the construction industry includes a housekeepingprovision stipulating that (1) when vacuuming is used for cleanup, onlyHEPA-filtered equipment may be used; and (2) all waste, scrap, debris,bags, containers, equipment, and contaminated clothing must be collectedand disposed of in sealed impermeable bags or in other closed impermeablecontainers. The Committee believes that these housekeeping practices reflectadvances in vacuum filter technology and good hygiene practices, and areessential parts of any effective MDA control program. The Committee believesthat the use of HEPA-filtered vacuums and proper disposal practices willconsiderably diminish the risk of generating airborne MDA during cleanup_apotentially high-exposure activity_and minimize the potential for dermalabsorption of MDA. The required use of high-efficiency particulate airfilters on vacuums employed for cleanup is not intended to preclude theuse of other complementary cleanup methods, such as wet methods (whereapplicable). The Committee believes that the recommended housekeeping requirementswill aid in minimizing worker contact with MDA. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (n). Medical Surveillance </ITAG>Where appropriate, the recommended construction standard requires thatmedical surveillance programs required by section 6(b)(7) of the OSH Actbe included in OSHA health standards to aid in determining whether thehealth of workers is adversely affected by exposure to toxic substances.The medical surveillance requirements contained in this recommended MDAconstruction standard are designed to detect changes in liver functionand signs or symptoms of acute liver disease. The Committee agreed that each employer must institute a medical surveillanceprogram for all employees exposed to MDA as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Employees exposed at or above the action level for more than 30 daysper year or who show signs or symptoms of exposure;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Employees who have the likelihood of dermal exposure for more than15 days per year, exhibit MDA dermal staining, or show signs or symptomsof exposure; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Employees who have been exposed in an emergency situation.</ITAG>The recommended language requires that the medical surveillance programprovide each covered employee with an opportunity for a medical examination.Further, all examinations and procedures must be performed by or underthe supervision of a licensed physician and be provided without cost tothe employee. Clearly, a licensed physician is the appropriate person tosupervise and evaluate a medical examination. However, certain parts ofthe required examination do not necessarily require the physician's expertiseand may be conducted by another person under the supervision of the physician.The Committee also recommends that exams be given at a reasonable timeand place. It is necessary that exams be convenient and be provided withoutloss of pay to the employee to assure that they are taken.The proposal allows the examining physician to prescribe the specific teststo be included in the medical surveillance program. Included are some specificrequirements, such as:(i) Comprehensive medical and work histories with special emphasis directedto an evaluation of other carcinogens to which the employee is exposed,and smoking and alcohol use;(ii) Comprehensive physical examination. with particular emphasis givento symptoms related to eye and skin irritation, and liver dysfunction;(iii) Complete urinalysis; and(iv) Screening for liver damage.It is important to note that the employer is required to make any prescribedtests available more often than specified if recommended by the examiningphysician. The Committee also recommends that the employer provide examinations recommendedby the physician to any employee exposed to MDA under emergency conditions.Due to the effects of high short-term exposures, it appears prudent tomonitor medically such affected employees. However, trivial exposures whichare peripherally related to an emergency do not trigger the requirement.The employer will also be required to provide the physician with the followinginformation: A copy of this standard and its appendices; a descriptionof the affected employee's duties as they relate to the employee exposurelevel; and information from the employee's previous medical examinationswhich is not readily available to the examining physician. Making thisinformation available to the physician will aid in the evaluation of theemployee's health in relation to assigned duties and fitness to wear personalprotective equipment. The employer is required to obtain a written opinion from the examiningphysician that contains the results of the medical examinations; the physician'sopinion as to whether the employee has any detected medical conditionswhich would place the employee at increased risk of material health impairmentfrom exposure to MDA; any recommended restrictions upon the employee'sexposure to MDA or upon the use of protective clothing or equipment, suchas respirators; and a statement that the employee has been informed bythe physician of the results of the medical examination and of any MDA-relatedmedical conditions which require further explanation or treatment. Thiswritten opinion must not reveal specific findings or diagnoses unrelatedto occupational exposure to MDA, and a copy of the opinion must be providedto the affected employee. The purpose of requiring the examining physician to supply the employerwith a written opinion is to provide the employer with a medical basisto aid in the determination of initial placement of employees and to assessthe employee's ability to use protective clothing and equipment. The requirementthat a physician's opinion be in written form will ensure that employershave had the benefit of this information. The requirement that an employeebe provided with a copy of the physician's written opinion will ensurethat the employee is informed of the results of the medical examination.The purpose of requiring that specific findings or diagnoses, unrelatedto occupational exposure to MDA, not be included in the written opinionis to encourage employees to take the medical examination by removing theconcern that the employer will obtain information about their physicalcondition that has no relation to present occupational exposures. Like the general industry standard this standard would also include a multiplephysician review mechanism. This mechanism was recommended because it wasthe Committee's belief that this would aid in ensuring that employees takephysical examinations. Finally, the draft language would contain provisionsfor removing an employee from exposure who has suffered reversible materialimpairment to health as a result of being exposed to MDA. The Committeeagreed that employees whose health has been adversely affected as a directresult of occupational exposure to MDA should be removed from exposureand should receive medical removal benefit protections.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (o) Recordkeeping </ITAG>The Committee's recommendations are consistent with section 8(c)(3) ofthe OSH Act which provides for the promulgation of regulations requiringemployers to maintain accurate records of employee exposures to potentiallytoxic substances or harmful physical agents which are required to be monitoredor measured. The Committee allows for the use of objective data in order to be exemptedfrom the standard. Records of objective data must be maintained to demonstratethat employees are not exposed to airborne MDA concentrations and thatthe likelihood for dermal exposure does not exist. The Committee also recommends that records be kept to identify the employeemonitored and to reflect the employee's exposure accurately. Specifically,records must include the following information: (a) The names and socialsecurity numbers of the employees sampled; (b) the number, duration, andresults of each of the samples taken, including a description of the representativesampling procedure and equipment used to determine employee exposure whereapplicable; (c) a description of the operation involving exposure to MDAwhich is being monitored and the date on which monitoring is performed;(d) the type of respiratory protective devices, if any, worn by the employee;and (e) a description of the sampling and analytical methods used, andevidence of their accuracy. The Committee's recommendation also includes a provision for requiringthe employer to keep an accurate medical record for each employee subjectto medical surveillance. Section 8(c) of the Act authorizes the promulgationof regulations requiring any employer to keep such records regarding theemployer's activities relating to the Act as are necessary or appropriatefor the enforcement of the Act or for developing information regardingthe causes and prevention of occupational illnesses. The Committee believesthat medical records, like exposure monitoring records, are necessary andappropriate to both the enforcement of the standard and the developmentof information regarding the causes and prevention of illness. As explained above, it is necessary to relate employees' medical conditionsto their exposures to develop information regarding cause and prevention.Medical records are necessary and appropriate for this purpose. In addition,medical records are necessary for the proper evaluation of the employee'shealth. The employer is also required to keep a record of any employee's medicalremoval and return to work status. The recommended draft requires that all records required to be kept shallbe made available upon request to the Assistant Secretary and the Directorof NIOSH for examination and copying. Access to these records is necessaryfor the agencies to monitor compliance with the standard. These recordsmay also contain essential information which is necessary for the agenciesto carry out their other statutory responsibilities. The recommended proposal would also provide for employees, former employees,and their designated representatives to have access to mandated recordsupon request. Section 8(c)(3) of the Act explicitly provides ``employeesor their representatives'' with an opportunity to observe monitoring andto have access to the records of monitoring and exposures to toxic substances;and several other provisions of the Act contemplate that employees andtheir representatives are entitled to play an active role in the enforcementof the Act. Employees and their representatives need to know relevant informationconcerning employee exposure to toxic substances and their health consequencesif they are to benefit fully from these statutory rights. In addition, access to exposure and medical records by employees, designatedrepresentatives, and OSHA is to be provided in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.20.Section 1910.20 is OSHA's generic standard for access to employee exposureand medical records (45 FR 35212). By its terms, it applies as to recordsrequired by specific standards, such as this MDA standard, as well as recordswhich are voluntarily created by employers. In general, it provides forunrestricted employee and designated representative access to exposurerecords. The Committee recommends that unrestricted access to both kindsof records be allowed, but also recommends that Agency access to personallyidentifiable records is made subject to rules of agency practice and procedureconcerning OSHA access to employee medical records, which have been publishedat 29 CFR 1913.10. An extensive discussion of the provisions and rationalefor andSection; 1920.20 may be found at 45 FR 35312; the discussion of andSection;1913.10 may be found at 45 FR 35384. It is necessary to keep records for extended periods because of the longlatency periods commonly observed for carcinogens. Cancer often cannotbe detected until 20 or more years after onset of exposure. The extendedretention period is therefore needed for two purposes. Diagnosis of diseasein employees is assisted by having present and past exposure data as wellas the results of the medical exams. Retaining records for extended periodsalso makes it possible at some future date to review the adequacy of thestandard. The time periods suggested for retention of exposure records and medicalrecords are thirty years, and period of employment plus thirty years, respectively.These retention periods are consistent with those in the OSHA records accessstandard. The recommended proposal would also require certain employers to notifythe Director in writing at least 3 months prior to the disposal of therecords. Section 1910.20(h) contains further requirements regarding thetransfer of records. To increase the effectiveness of training goals the draft requires thatthe training material be made available, without cost, to all affectedemployees or their representatives.The Committee recognizes the transient nature of the Construction industryand the difficulties which this industry may have with recordkeeping requirements;it is for this reason that the Committee would not mandate the specificmethods of recordkeeping. Employers are free to use the services of competentorganizations such as industry trade associations and employee associationsto maintain the required records. To reduce the costs and facilitate therecordkeeping some groups currently use centralized medical recordkeepingfinanced through employer contributions. Centralized recordkeeping couldbe instrumental in alleviating the problem of lost records associated withthe transient nature of the construction workforce and the frequency ofbusiness closures in this sector. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (p) Observation of Monitoring </ITAG>The Committee also recommends that OSHA include a provision for observationof exposure monitoring. This provision is in accordance with section 8(c)of the OSH Act which requires that employers provide employees and theirrepresentatives with the opportunity to observe monitoring of employeeexposures to toxic substances or harmful physical agents. Observation proceduresare set forth which require the observer, whether it be an employee ora designated representative, to be provided with the personal protectiveclothing and equipment that is required to be worn by the employees whoare working in the area. The employer is required to assure the use ofsuch clothing and equipment or respirators and is responsible for requiringthat the observer complies with all other applicable safety and healthprocedures. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (q) Effective Dates </ITAG>The Committee did not establish a section for effective dates. However,the Committee did not indicate in any of its feasibility findings thatany specific time would be needed to comply with the implementation ofany of the recommendated standards. Thus OSHA has developed its effectivedate section based on the feasibility analysis recommended by the Committee.<ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (r) Start-Up Dates </ITAG>The Committee did not establish a section for start-up dates. As was donefor effective dates, OSHA based its selection of start-up dates on thefeasibility analysis done by the Committee. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paragraph (s) Appendices </ITAG>Five appendices have been included at the end ot this proposed standard.Appendices A, B, C, and D have been included primarily for purposes ofinformation. None of the statements contained in Appendices A, B, C, andD should be construed as establishing a mandatory requirement not otherwiseimposed by the standard, or as detracting from an obligation which thestandard does impose. However, the protocols for respiratory fit testingin Appendix E are mandatory. Appendix A contains information on the description and exposure levelsof MDA. Also provided in Appendix A is information on the health hazardsassociated with exposure, descriptions of protective clothing and equipment,emergency and first aid procedures, medical requirements, provisions forthe observation of monitoring, access to exposure and medical records,and precautions for the safe use, handling, and storage of MDA. Appendix B contains ``substance technical guidelines'' for MDA, includingphysical and chemical data, spill and leak procedures, including wastedisposal methods, and other miscellaneous precautions for the safe handlingof MDA. Appendix C contains the medical surveillance guidelines for MDA. Includedin these guidelines are the description of the routes of entry, the toxicologyand symptoms and signs associated with MDA exposure, information on thetreatment of acute toxic effects, and surveillance and preventive considerations.including hematology guidelines which may be useful to physicians in conductingthe medical surveillance program required by paragraph (i) of this recommendedstandard. Appendix D gives details of the recommended sampling and analytical methodsfor use in monitoring employee exposures to MDA. Appendix E gives detailed fit testing procedures that are to be followedfor qualitative and quantitative fit testing of negative pressure respirators.Various protocols for qualitative and quantitative fit tests are outlinedin detail. All the Appendices are designed to aid the employer in complying with therequirements of the standard. Paragraph (j) of this proposed standard onthe ``communication of MDA hazards to employees'' specifically requiresthat the contents of the standard and Appendices A and B be made availableto affected employees. Information contained in Appendix C on medical surveillanceis to be explained to affected employees. The information in Appendix Calso provides information to evaluate the results of the information neededby the physician to evaluate the results of the medical examination. (<T3>b</T3>) OSHA's Findings <ITAG tagnum="81">1. General </ITAG>OSHA has relied heavily on the recommendations made by the Committee indeveloping its own NPRM for construction. There were however. several instancesin which OSHA made changes to the Committee's recommended constructionstandard. OSHA has made these corrections in the regulatory text of itsNPRM. OSHA believes that these changes do not alter or amend the Committee'sactual recommendations, instead, these changes clarify what OSHA believesthe Committee intended. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Specific </ITAG><T3>Paragraphs (a) Scope and Application. </T3>OSHA reviewed the Committee'srecommendations for this paragraph and has used these recommendations asthe basis for its NPRM. OSHA agrees that construction should have its ownstandard and believes that the Committee has sufficiently defined the scopeand application for this standard. OSHA recognizes that the Committee haddifficulty identifying affected employers in this sector. OSHA believesthat the examples of MDA uses are adequate and that the scope and applicationare adequately defined. <T3>Paragraph (b) Definitions. </T3>The Committee provided OSHA with anumber of definitions to be used in the recommended standard. OSHA findsthat the Committee's recommendations are appropriate and, for the mostpart has adopted the Committee's recommendations in its definition paragraphin the NPRM. OSHA has expanded upon or clarified some of the Committee'srecommended definitions. For example, for action level and STEL OSHA hasinserted numeric values into the definitions. OSHA has also amended thedefinition of regulated areas to reflect only the definition and not theintended duties. OSHA has also deleted the term ``competent person'' andhas replaced this term with ``employer''.<T3>Paragraph (c) Permissible Exposure Limits. </T3>OSHA accepts the Committee'srecommendations for permissible exposure limits for the construction industryand has made the Committee's recommendations part of its NPRM. As withthe general industry standard, OSHA was concerned with the relationshipbetween ambient and dermal exposure and the effectiveness of establishingthese PELs. OSHA finds, as it did in the general industry standard thatthe PELs and the other standard provisions are necessary to adequatelycontrol worker exposure to MDA (See discussion in PEL section in generalindustry standard). In addition, OSHA believes that for construction asis the case for general industry that the STEL selected is appropriateand will aid in preventing acute toxicity and carcinogenicity in workersexposed to MDA in the construction industry (See discussion in PEL sectionin general industry standard). <T3>Paragraph (d) Employee Rotation. </T3>While included in OSHA's NPRM,it does not appear as a separate paragraph. Instead OSHA has moved it tothe methods of compliance section. OSHA did use the Committee's recommendedregulatory text in its own NPRM for this provision (See (h)(5)). <T3>Paragraph (e) Is Now Paragraph (d) Communication Among Employers. </T3>OSHArelied on the Committee's recommended regulatory text in developing itsown NPRM. OSHA believes that including a communication among employersprovision will aid in preventing inadvertant MDA exposure to workers onmulti-employer sites. <T3>Paragraph (f) Is Now Paragraph (e) Emergency Situations. </T3>OSHAalso relied on the Committee's recommendations in developing its emergencyprovision in its NPRM. OSHA agrees that providing a written plan for emergencysituations and an employee alerting mechanism will warn employees of animpending hazard and the correct procedures for abating such. Given thepotential for acute toxicity and possibly death posed by exposure to infrequent,high doses of MDA emergency provision are clearly needed. <T3>Paragraph (g) Is Now Paragraph (f) Exposure Monitoring. </T3>OSHA madeuse of the Committee's recommendations in drafting its own monitoring provisions.Like the general industry standard, OSHA attempted to clarify the Committee'sintent with respect to monitoring and has made it clear that monitoringfor the STEL must also be done. OSHA has also included the visual monitoringprovisions in its NPRM. OSHA believes that these provisions will aid theemployer in early detection of ineffective personal protective clothing.<T3>Paragraph (h) Is Now Paragraph (g) Regulated Areas. </T3>OSHA recognizesthe significance which regulated areas has in providing worker protectionon multi-work sites. OSHA agrees that restricting employee access and requiringthe use of personal protection equipment is necessary. While OSHA has relied on the Committee's recommended regulatory text, OSHAhas made a number of changes. First, OSHA has removed some of the repetitionby including the establishment provisions under one sub heading insteadof two. Secondly, OSHA has attempted to clarify the establishment requirementsfor employees dermally exposed. OSHA recognizes as did the Committee thatdermal exposure can occur from ambient ``fall out''. In this instance,where liquid mixtures have been allowed to become airborne and now poseboth an inhalation and a dermal exposure hazard, regulated areas must beestablished in areas in excess of the PEL. On the other hand, if exposureis to non-ambient liquid mixtures then these areas must be demarcated asregulated areas. OSHA agrees with the feasibility findings of the Committeein this respect and believes that caution tape may be used to mark offthese areas. Because dermal exposure makes a significant contribution toemployee exposure, neither the Committee nor OSHA looks favorably on inadvententor excessive employee exposure to liquid mixtures. <T3>Paragraph (i) Is Now Paragraph (h) Methods of Compliance. </T3>OSHAhas relied on the Committee's recommendations in developing this paragraphin its NPRM. OSHA, however, found it necessary to amend the regulatorytext proposed by the Committee in order to make it conform to the rationaleproposed by the Committee. OSHA recognizes the difficulty associated wirhdrafting regulatory text and believes that the text proposed by OSHA reflectsthe Committee's position. Firstly, the Committee recommended the traditional hierarchy of controlfor MDA exposure in the construction sector. However, for workers engagedin spray application, the Committee recommended that a respirator be usedin conjunction with feasible engineering controls. The Committee also acknowledgedthat for spray painters engaged in application in non-barriered areas,that feasible engineering controls and work practices do not exist andthat worker protection is achieved exclusively through the use of a respirator.OSHA accepts the Committee's findings in this limited instance and hasincluded special provisions in the regulatory text of its NPRM to acknowledgethese findings. Furthermore, OSHA also believes as did the Committee thatthis control hierachy would result in exposures much less than the 10 ppbPEL proposed. In addition, the regulatory text of the Committee's recommendations proposeto exclude the spray application of MDA. Yet, in the Committee' s discussionsand even in the Committee s feasibility determinations, the significanceand wides-spread use of this technique in construction is apparent. Duringthe final committee meeting the Committee agreed to delete this provisionfrom the regulatory text of the construction standard but the amendmentwas not made to the text. OSHA has made this modification to its NPRM andbelieves that this modification reflects the Committee recommendations.<T3>Paragraph (j) Is Now Paragraph (i) Respiratory Protection. </T3>OSHAreviewed the Committee's recommendations regarding the use of respiratoryprotection and has relied on these recommendations to make findings inits NPRM. OSHA has modified the Committee's recommendations slightly toreflect that spray painters are required to wear respirators. This changeresults from the clarifications which OSHA made to paragraph (h), methodsof compliance. <T3>Paragraph (k) Is Now Paragraph (j) Protective Work Clothing and Equipment.</T3>OSHA agrees that the Committee's recommendations for the use of personalprotective equipment and clothing are appropriate, however, OSHA has modifiedthe format recommended by the Committee. OSHA has redesigned the formatof this paragraph to be compatible with this same paragraph in the generalindustry standard. OSHA believes that this format assists in producingease of regulatory interpretation. OSHA acknowledges that many of the clarificationsand format corrections which have been made oould have been corrected bypublication of a correction document to the Committee's July 16, 1987 <T4>Federal Register </T4>document. Traditionally, OSHA publishes a correctiondocument following publication of a lengthy rulemaking. A correction documentwas not done for the Committee's recommendations, moreso because, OSHAbelieved that these corrections could be made through its NPRM. OSHA believesthis to be a cost-effective alternative. <T3>Paragraph (l) Is Now Paragraph (k) Hygiene Facilities and Practices.</T3>OSHA accepts the Committee's recommendations and generally has usedthe regulatory text proposed by the Committee in its NPRM. OSHA, as inthe general industry standard, has deleted the phrase. ``Shower facilitiesfor employees exposed only in this manner may not be necessary'' foundin (k)(2)(ii) of this paragraph, to include only the obligatory portionsof the provision.<T3>Paragraph (m) Is Now Paragraph (l) Communication of Hazards to Employees.</T3>OSHA generally has accepted the Committee's recommended paragraphin this instance, except that some unnecessary terminology has been removed.<T3>Paragraph (n) Is Now Paragraph (m) Housekeeping. </T3>OSHA has usedthe Committee's recommendations to develop this paragraph in its NPRM.<T3>Paragraph (o) Is Now Paragraph (n) Medical Surveillance. </T3>OSHAhas relied on the Committee's recommendations in developing its NPRM forthis paragraph. As discussed in the general industry medical surveillanceparagraph, OSHA considered the appropriateness of medical surveillanceand the possibility of ``sunsetting'' this provision. OSHA believes thatmedical surveillance for workers exposed to MDA in the construction industryis necessary. Furthermore, the maintenance of this provision is crucialto the continued health and safety of workers exposed to MDA in construction(See medical surveillance discussion for the general industry standard).<T3>Paragraph (n) Is Now Paragraph (o) Recordkeeping. </T3>OSHA has reviewedthe Committee's recommendations and has used their recommendaticns as thebasis for its NPRM. <T3>Paragraph (o) Is Now Paragraph (p) Observation of Monitoring. </T3>OSHAhas reviewed the Committee's recommendations and has used their recommendationsas the basis for its NPRM. <T3>Paragraph (p) Is Now Paragraph (q) Effective Dates. </T3>The Committeedid not establish a section for effective dates. However, the Committeedid not indicate in any of its feasibility findings that any specific timewould be needed to comply with the implementation of any of the recommendatedstandards. Thus OSHA has developed its effective date section based onthe feasibility analysis recommended by the Committee. <T3>Paragraph (q) Is Now Paragraph (r) Appendices. </T3>Five appendiceshave been included at the end of this proposed standard. Appendices A,B, C, and D have been included primarily for purposes of information. Noneof the statements contained in Appendices A, B, C, and D should be construedas establishing a mandatory requirement not otherwise imposed by the standard,or as detracting from an obligation which the standard does impose. However,the protocols for respiratory fit testing in Appendix E are mandatory.Appendix A contains information on the description and exposure levelsof MDA. Also provided in Appendix A is information on the health hazardsassociated with exposure, descriptions of protective clothing and equipment,emergency and first aid procedures, medical requirements, provisions forthe observation of monitoring, access to exposure and medical records,and precautions for the safe use, handling, and storage of MDA. Appendix B contains ``substance technical guidelines'' for MDA, includingphysical and chemical data, spill and leak procedures. including wastedisposal methods, and other miscellaneous precautions for the safe handlingof MDA. Appendix C contains the medical surveillance guidelines for MDA. Includedin these guidelines are the description of the routes of entry, the toxicologyand symptoms and signs associated with MDA exposure, information on thetreatment of acute toxic effects, and surveillance and preventive considerations,including hematology guidelines which may be useful to physicians in conductingthe medical surveillance program required by paragraph (m) of this recommendedstandard. Appendix D gives details of the recommended sampling and analytical methodsfor use in monitoring employee exposures to MDA. Appendix E gives detailed fit testing procedures that are to be followedfor qualitative or quantitative fit testing of negative pressure respirators.Various protocols for qualitiative and quantitative fit tests are outlinedin detail. All the Appendices are designed to aid the employer in complying with therequirements of the standard. Paragraph (k) of this proposed standard onthe ``communication of MDA hazards to employees'' specifically requiresthat the contents of the standard and Appendices A and B be made availableto affected employees. Information contained in Appendix C on medical surveillanceis to be explained to affected employees. Appendix C also provides informationneeded by the physician to evaluate the results of the medical examination.<T3>Paragraph (r) Is Now Paragraph (s) Start-up Dates. </T3>The Committeedid not establish a section for start-up dates. As was done for effectivedates, OSHA based its selection of start-up dates on the feasibility analysisdone by the Committee.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Environmental Assessment Findings of No Significant Impact </ITAG>A. Summary of the Committee's Recommendations The Committee has reviewed the environmental impact in accordance withthe requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969(42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations(40 CFR Part 1500), and OSHA's DOL NEPA Compliance procedures (29 CFR Part11). As a result of this review, the Committee has determined that the proposedrule will not have a significant impact on the external environment. Impactson the workplace environment are discussed in other portions of this preamble.B. OSHA's Findings OSHA has reviewed the Committee's recommendations with respect to environmentalimpact and finds that the recommendation is appropriate and adopts thisrecommendation as its own. <ITAG tagnum="84">X.

State Plan Requirements </ITAG>The 25 States and territories with their own OSHA-approved occupationalsafety and health plans must revise their existing standards within sixmonths of the publication date of the final standard or show OSAA why thereis no need for action, e.g., because an existing already ``at least aseffective'' as the revised Federal standard. These States California, Connecticut,(State and local government workers only), Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, (State andlocal government workers only), North Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont,Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington and Wyoming.<ITAG tagnum="84">XII. Federalism </ITAG>The proposed standard has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987) regarding Federalism. This Orderrequires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting Statepolicy options, consult with States prior to taking any actions that wouldrestrict State policy options, and take such actions only when there isclear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of nationalscope. The Order provides for preemption of State law only if there isa clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of nationalscope. The Order provides for preemption of State law only if there isa clear Congressional intent for the agency to do so. Any such preemptionis to be limited to the extent possible. Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), expressesCongress' clear intent to preempt State laws relating to issues with respectto which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety or health standards.Under the OSH Act a State can avoid preemption only if it submits, andobtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development of such standardsand their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developedby such Plan-States must, among other things, be at least as effectivein providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment asthe Federal standards. The federally proposed MDA standard is drafted so that workers in everyState would be protected by general, performance-oriented standards. Tothe extent that there are State or regional peculiarities that could alterwork practices, States with occupational safety and health plans approvedunder section 18 of the OSH Act would be able to develop their own Statestandards to deal with any special problems. Moreover, the performancenature of this proposed standard, of and by itself, allows for flexibilityby States and contractors to provide as much safety as possible using varyingmethods consonant with conditions in each State. In short, there is clear national problem related to occupational safetyand health of workers. While the individual States, if all acted, mightbe able collectively to deal with the safety problems involved, most havenot elected to do so in the seventeen years since the enactment of theOSH Act. Those States which have elected to particpate under section 18of the OSH Act would not be preempted by this proposed regulation and wouldbe able to deal with special, local conditions within the framework providedby this performance-oriented standard while ensuring that their standardsare at least as effective as the Federal standard. State comments are invitedon this proposal and will be fully considered prior to promulgation ofa final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">XIII.

Common Operations </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Common operations in which exposure to MDA is likely to occur includethe following: Manufacture of MDA; Manufacture of Methylene diisocyanate;Curing agent for epoxy resin structures; Wire coating operations; and filamentwinding.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix C to </ITAG>andSection; <T4>1910.1050_Medical Surveillance Guidelines for MDA </T4><ITAG tagnum="73">I. Route of Entry </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Inhalation; skin absorption; ingestion. MDA can be inhaled, absorbedthrough the skin, or ingested. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">II. Toxicology </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">MDA is a suspect carcinogen in humans. There are several reports ofliver disease in humans and animals resulting from acute exposure to MDA.A well documented case of an acute cardiomyopathy secondary to exposureto MDA is on record. Numerous human cases of hepatitis secondary to MDAare known. Upon direct contact MDA may also cause damage to the eyes. Dermatitisand skin sensitization have been observed.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Almost all forms of acute environmental hepatic injury in humans involvethe hepatic parenchyma and produce hepatocellular jaundice. This agentproduces intrahepatic cholestasis. The clinical picture consists of cholestaticjaundice, preceded or accompanied by abdominal pain, fever, and chills.Onset in about 60% of all observed cases is abrupt with severe abdominalpain. In about 30% of observed cases, the illness presented and evolvedmore slowly and less dramatically, with only slight abdominal pain. Inabout 10% of the cases only jaundice was evident. The cholestatic natureof the jaundice is evident in the prominence of itching, the histologicpredominence of bile stasis, and portal inflammatory infiltration, accompaniedby only slight parenchymal injury in most cases, and by the moderatelyelevated transaminase values. Acute, high doses, however, have been knownto cause hepatocellular damage resulting in elevated SGPT, SGOT, alkalinephosphatase and bilirubin. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Absorption through the skin is rapid. MDA is metabolized and excretedover a 48-hour period. Direct contact may be irritating to the skin, causingdermatitis. Also MDA which is deposited on the skin is not thoroughly removedthrough washing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">MDA may cause bladder cancer in humans. Animal data supporting thisassumption is not available nor is conclusive human data. However, humandata collected on workers at a helicopter manufacturing facility whereMDA is used suggests a higher incidence of bladder cancer among exposedworkers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">III. Signs and Symptoms </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Skin may beoome yellow from contact with MDA. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Repeated or prolonged contact with MDA may result in recurring dermatitis(red-itchy, cracked skin) and eye irritation. Inhalation, ingestion orabsorption through the skin at high concentrations may result in hepatitis,causing symptoms such as fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, dark urine,anorexia, rash, right upper quadrant pain and jaundice. Corneal burns mayoccur when MDA is splashed in the eyes.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">IV. Treatment of Acute Toxic Effects/Emergency Situation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If MDA gets into the eyes, immediately wash eyes with large amountsof water. If MDA is splashed on the skin, immediately wash contaminatedskin with mild soap or detergent. Employee should be removed from exposureand given proper medical treatment. Medical tests required under the emergencysection of the medical surveillance section (m)(4) must be conducted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If the chemical is swallowed do not induce vomiting but remove bygastric lavage. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="75">Appendix D to </ITAG>andSection; <T4>1910.1050_Sampling and Analytical Methods for MDA Monitoring and MeasurementProcedures </T4><ITAG tagnum="21">Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposureto MDA are best taken so that the representative average 8-hour exposuremay be determined from a single 8-hour sample or two (2) 4-hour samples.Short-time interval samples (or grab samples) may also be used to determineaverage exposure level if a minimum of five measurements are taken in arandom manner over the 8-hour work shift. Random sampling means that anyportion of the work shift has the same chance of being sampled as any other.The arithmetic average of all such random samples taken on one work shiftis an estimate of an employee's average level of exposure for that workshift. Air samples should be taken in the employee's breathing zone (airthat would most nearly represent that inhaled by the employee). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are a number of methods available for monitoring employee exposuresto MDA. The method OSHA currently uses is included below. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The employer, however, has the obligation of selecting any monitoringmethod which meets the accuracy and precision requirements of the standardunder his unique field conditions. The standard requires that the methodof monitoring must have an accuracy, to a 95 percent confidence level,of not less than plus or minus 25 percent for the select PEL.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">OSHA Methodology </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Sampling Procedure </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Apparatus </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Samples are collected by use of a personal sampling pump that canbe calibrated within andplusmin; 5% of the recommended flow rate with thesampling filter in line. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Samples are collected on 37 mm Gelman type A/E glass fiber filterstreated with sulfuric acid. The filters are prepared by soaking each filterwith 0.5 mL of 0.26N H<T2>2</T2>SO<T2>4</T2>. (0.26 N H<T2>2</T2>SO<T2>4</T2> can be prepared by diluting 1.5 mL of 36N H<T2>2</T2>SO<T2>4</T2> to 200 mL with deionized water.) The filters are dried in anoven at 100 degrees C for one hour and then assembled into two-piece 37mm polystyrene cassettes with backup pads. The cassettes are sealed withshrink bands and the ends are plugged with plastic plugs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After sampling, the filters are carefully removed from the cassettesand individually transferred to small vials containing approximately 2mL deionized water. The vials must be tightly sealed. The water can beadded before or after the filters are transferred. The vials must be sealableand capable of holding at least 7 mL of liquid. Small glass scintillationvials with caps containing Teflon liners are recommended. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73"> Reagents </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Deionized water is needed for addition to the vials. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Sampling Technique    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Immediately before sampling, remove the plastic plugs from the filtercassettes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Attach the cassette to the sampling pump with flexible tubing andplace the cassette in the employee's breathing zone. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After sampling, seal the cassettes with plastic plugs until the filtersare transferred to the vials containing deionized water. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At some convenient time within 10 hours of sampling, transfer thesample filters to vials. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Seal the small vials lengthwise. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Submit at least one blank filter with each sample set.

Instead of using backup pads, blank acid-treatedfilters were used as backups in each cassette. Upon analysis, the top filterswere found to have an average of 91.8% of the spiked amount. There wasno MDA found on the bottom filters, so the amount lost was probably dueto the slight instability of the MDA salt. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Extraction Efficiency </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The average extraction efficiency for six filters spiked at    thetarget concentration is 99.6%. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The stability of extracted and derivatized samples was verified byreanalyzing the above six samples the next day using fresh standards. Theaverage extraction efficiency for the reanalyzed samples is 98.7%. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Recommended Air Volume and Sampling Rate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The recommended air volume is 100 L. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The recommended sampling rate i 1 L/min. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Interferences (Sampling) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">MDI appears to be a positive interference.

The fit test chamber shall be similar to a clear 55 gallon drumliner suspended inverted over a 2-foot diameter frame, so that the topof chamber is about 6 inches above the test subject's head. The insidetop center of the chamber shall have a small hook attached. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Each respirator used for the fitting and fit testing shall be equippedwith organic vapor cartridges or offer protection against organic vapors.The cartridges or canisters shall be replaced as necessary to maintainthe effectiveness of the respirator. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. After selecting, donning, and properly adjusting a respirator,the test subject shall wear it to the fit testing room. This room shallbe separate from the room used for odor threshold screening and respiratorselection, and shall be well ventilated, as by an exhaust fan or lab hood,to prevent general room contamination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. A copy of the following test exercises and Rainbow Passage shallbe taped to the inside of the test chamber: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Test Exercises </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">i. Breathe normally. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">ii. Breathe deeply. Be certain breaths are <T3>deep </T3>and <T3>regular.</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">iii. Turn head all the way from one side to the other. Inhale on eachside. Be certain movement is complete. Do not bump the respirator againstthe shoulders. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">iv. Nod head up-and-down. Inhale when head is in the full up position(looking toward ceiling). Be certain motions are complete and made aboutevery second. Do not bump the respirator on the chest. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">v. Talking. Talk aloud and slowly for several minutes. The followingparagraph is called the Rainbow Passage. Reading it aloud will result ina wide range of facial movements, and thus be useful to satisfy this requirement.Alternative passages which serve the same purpose may also be used. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">vi. Jog in place. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">vii. Breathe normally. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Rainbow Passage </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like a prismand form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into manybeautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its pathhigh above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, accordingto legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one everfinds it. When a man looks for something beyond reach, his friends sayhe is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Each test subject shall wear the respirator for at a least 10 minutesbefore starting the fit test. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. Upon entering the test chamber, the test subject shall be givena 6 inch by 5 inch piece of paper towel or other porous absorbent singleply material, folded in half and wetted with three-quarters of one cc ofpure IAA. The test subject shall hang the wet towel on the hook at thetop of the chamber. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. Allow two minutes for the IAA test concentration to be reachedbefore starting the fit-test exercises. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. Each exercise described in andplusmin;4 above shall be performedfor at least one minute. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. If at any time during the test, the subject detects the banana-likeodor of IAA, the test has failed. The subject shall quickly exit from thetest chamber and leave the test area to avoid olfactory fatigue. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. If the test is failed, the subject shall return to the selectionroom and remove the respirator, repeat the odor sensitivity test, selectand put on another respirator, return to the test chamber, and again beginthe procedure described in the c(4) through c(8) above. The process continuesuntil a respirator that fits well has been found. Should the odor sensitivitytest be failed, the subject shall wait about 5 minutes before retesting.Odor sensitivity will usually have returned by this time. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">11. If a person cannot pass the fit test described above wearing ahalf-mask respirator from the available selection, full facepiece modelsmust be used. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">12. When a respirator is found that passes the test, the subject mustbreak the faceseal and take a breath before exiting the chamber. This isto assure that the reason the test subject is not smelling the IAA is thegood fit of the respirator facepiece seal and not olfactory fatigue. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">13. When the test subject leaves the chamber, the subject shall removethe saturated towel and return it to the person conducting the test. Tokeep the area from becoming contaminated, the used towels shall be keptin a self-sealing bag so there is no significant IAA concentration buildupin the test chamber during subsequent tests. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">14. Persons who have successfully passed this fit test with a half-maskrespirator may be assigned the use of the test respirator in atmosphereswith up to 10 times the PEL. In atmospheres greater than 10 times, andless than 50 times the PEL (up to 50 ppm), the subject must pass the IAAtest using a full face negative pressure respirator. (The concentrationof the IAA inside the test chamber must be increased by five times forQLFT of the full facepiece.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">15. The test shall not be conducted if there is any hair growth betweenthe skin and the facepiece sealing surface. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">16. If hair growth or apparel interfere with a satisfactory fit, thenthey shall be altered or removed so as to eliminate interference and allowa satisfactory fit. If a satisfactory fit is still not attained, the testsubject must use a positive-pressure respirator such as a powered air-purifyingrespirator, supplied air respirator, or self-contained breathing apparatus.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">17. If a test subject exhibits difficulty in breathing during thetests, she or he shall be referred to a physician trained in respiratorydiseases or pulmonary medicine to determine whether the test subject canwear a respirator while performing her or his duties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">18.

Using a DeVilbiss Model 40 lnhalation Medication Nebulizer or equivalent,the test conductor shall spray the threshold check solution into the enclosure.This nebulizer shall be clearly marked to distinguish it from the fit testsolution nebulizer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. The threshold check solution consists of 0.83 grams of sodium saccharin,USP in water. It can be prepared by putting 1 cc of the test solution (seeC 7 below) in 100 cc of water.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. To produce the aerosol, the nebulizer bulb is firmly squeezed sothat it collapses completely, then is released and allowed to fully expand.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. Ten squeezes of the nebulizer bulb are repeated rapidly and thenthe test subject is asked whether the saccharin can be tasted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. If the first response is negative, ten more squeezes of the nebulizerbulb are repeated rapidly and the test subject is again asked whether thesaccharin can be tasted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10.

Employers shall advise employees of all areas and operations whereexposure to MDA could occur.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">VII. Housekeeping and Hygiene Facilities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. The workplace should be kept clean, orderly, and in a sanitarycondition.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The employer should institute a leak and spill detection program foroperations involving MDA in order to detect sources of fugitive MDA emissions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. Adequate washing facilities with hot and cold water are to be providedand maintained in a sanitary condition. Suitable cleansing agents shouldalso be provided to assure the effective removal of MDA from the skin.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">VIII. Common Operations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Common operations in which exposure to MDA is likely to occur includethe following: Manufacture of MDA; Manufacture of Methylene diisocyanate;Curing agent for epoxy resin structures; Wire coating operations; and filamentwinding.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix C to </ITAG>andSection; 1926.60_Medical Surveillance Guidelinesfor MDA<ITAG tagnum="73">I. Route of Entry</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Inhalation; skin absorption; ingestion. MDA can be inhaled, absorbedthrough the skin, or ingested.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">II. Toxicology</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">MDA is a suspect carcinogen in humans. There are several reports ofliver disease in humans and animals resulting from acute exposure to MDA.A well documented case of an acute cardiomyopathy secondary to exposureto MDA is on record. Numerous human cases of hepatitis secondary to MDAare known. Upon direct contact MDA may also cause damage to the eyes. Dermatitisand skin sensitization have been observed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Almost all forms of acute environmental hepatic injury in humans involvethe hepatic parenchyma and produce hepatocellular jaundice. This agentproduces intrahepatic cholestasis. The clinical picture consists of cholestaticjaundice, preceded or accompanied by abdominal pain, fever, and chills.Onset in about 60% of all observed cases is abrupt with severe abdominalpain. In about 30% of observed cases, the illness presented and evolvedmore slowly and less dramatically, with only slight abdominal pain. Inabout 10% of the cases only jaundice was evident. The cholestatic natureof the jaundice is evident in the prominence of itching, the histologicpredominance of bile stasis, and portal inflammatory infiltration, accompaniedby only slight parenchymal injury in most cases, and by the moderatelyelevated transaminase values. Acute, high doses, however, have been knownto cause hepatocellular damage resulting in elevated SGPT, SGOT, alkalinephosphatase and bilirubin.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Absorption through the skin is rapid. MDA is metabolized and excretedover a 48-hour period. Direct contact may be irritating to the skin, causingdermatitis. Also MDA which is deposited on the skin is not thoroughly removedthrough washing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">MDA may cause bladder cancer in humans. Animal data supporting thisassumption is not available nor is conclusive human data. However, humandata collected on workers at a helicopter manufacturing facility whereMDA is used suggests a higher incidence of bladder cancer among exposedworkers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">III. Signs and Symptoms</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Skin may become yellow from contact with MDA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Repeated or prolonged contact with MDA may result in recurring dermatitis(red-itchy, cracked skin) and eye irritation. Inhalation, ingestion orabsorption through the skin at high concentrations may result in hepatitis,causing symptoms such as fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, dark urine,anorexia, rash, right upper quadrant pain and jaundice. Corneal burns mayoccur when MDA is splashed in the eyes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">IV. Treatment of Acute Toxic Effects/Emergency Situation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If MDA gets into the eyes, immediately wash eyes with large amountsof water. If MDA is splashed on the skin, immediately wash contaminatedskin with mild soap or detergent. Employee should be removed from exposureand given proper medical treatment. Medical tests required under the emergencysection of the medical surveillance section (m)(4) must be conducted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If the chemical is swallowed do not induce vomiting but remove bygastric lavage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="75">Appendix D to </ITAG>andSection; 1926.60_Sampling and Analytical Methodsfor MDA Monitoring and Measurement Procedures<ITAG tagnum="21">Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposureto MDA are best taken so that the representative average 8-hour exposuremay be determined from a single 8-hour sample or two (2) 4-hour samples.Short-time interval samples (or grab samples) may also be used to determineaverage exposure level if a minimum of five measurements are taken in arandom manner over the 8-hour work shift. Random sampling means that anyportion of the work shift has the same chance of being sampled as any other.The arithmetic average of all such random samples taken on one work shiftis an estimate of an employee's average level of exposure for that workshift. Air samples should be taken in the employee's breathing zone (airthat would most nearly represent that inhaled by the employee).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are a number of methods available for monitoring employee exposuresto MDA. The method OSHA currently uses is included below.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The employer however has the obligation of selecting any monitoringmethod which meets the accuracy and precision requirements of the standardunder his unique field conditions. The standard requires that the methodof monitoring must have an accuracy, to a 95 percent confidence level,of not less than plus or minus 25 percent for the select PEL.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">OSHA Methodology</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Sampling Procedure</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Apparatus</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Samples are collected by use of a personal sampling pump that canbe calibrated within andplusmin; 5% of the recommended flow rate with thesampling filter in line.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Samples are collected on 37 mm Gelman type A/E glass fiber filterstreated with sulfuric acid. The filters are prepared by soaking each filterwith 0.5 mL of 0.26N H<T2>2</T2>SO<T2>4</T2>. (0.26 N H<T2>2</T2>SO<T2>4</T2> can be prepared by diluting 1.5 mL of 36N H<T2>2</T2>SO<T2>4</T2> to 200 mL with deionized water.) The filters are dried in anoven at 100 degrees C for one hour and then assembled into two-piece 37mm polystyrene cassettes with backup pads. The cassettes are sealed withshrink bands and the ends are plugged with plastic plugs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After sampling, the filters are carefully removed from the cassettesand individually transferred to small vials containing approximately 2mL deionized water. The vials must be tightly sealed. The water can beadded before or after the filters are transferred. The vials must be sealableand capable of holding at least 7 mL of liquid. Small glass scintillationvials with caps containing Teflon liners are recommended.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Reagents</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Deionized water is needed for addition to the vials.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Sampling Technique</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Immediately before sampling, remove the plastic plugs from the filtercassettes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Attach the cassette to the sampling pump with flexible tubing andplace the cassette in the employee's breathing zone.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After sampling, seal the cassettes with plastic plugs until the filtersare transferred to the vials containing deionized water.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At some convenient time within 10 hours of sampling, transfer thesample filters to vials.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Seal the small vials lengthwise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Submit at least one blank filter with each sample set.

Instead of using backup pads, blank acid-treatedfilters were used as backups in each cassette. Upon analysis, the top filterswere found to have an average of 91.8% of the spiked amount. There wasno MDA found on the bottom filters, so the amount lost was probably dueto the slight instability of the MDA salt.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Extraction Efficiency</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The average extraction efficiency for six filters spiked at the targetconcentration is 99.6%.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The stability of extracted and derivatized samples was verified byreanalyzing the above six samples the next day using fresh standards.

Odor-free water (e.g. distilled or spring water) at approximately25anddegrees; C shall be used for the solutions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The isoamyl acetate (IAA) (also known as isopentyl acetate) stocksolution is prepared by adding 1 cc of pure IAA to 800 cc of odor freewater in a 1-liter jar and shaking for 30 seconds. This solution shallbe prepared new at least weekly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The screening test shall be conducted in a room separate from theroom used for actual fit testing. The two rooms shall be well ventilatedso that circulation of the test solution does not occur and cross contaminatethe testing different sites.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. The odor test solution is prepared in a second jar by placing 0.4cc of the stock solution into 500 cc of odor free water using a clean dropperor pipette. Shake for 30 seconds and allow to stand for two to three minutesso that the IAA concentration above the liquid may reach equilibrium. Thissolution may be used for only one day.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. A test blank is prepared in a third jar by adding 500 cc of odorfree water.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7.

The following instructions shall be typed on a card and placedon the table in front of the two test jars (i.e. and 1 and 2): ``The purposeof this test is to determine if you can smell banana oil at a low concentration.The two bottles in front of you contain water. One of these bottles alsocontains a small amount of banana oil. Be sure the covers are on tight,then shake each bottle for two seconds. Unscrew the lid of each bottle,one at a time, and sniff at the mouth of the bottle. Indicate to the testconductor which bottle contains banana oil.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. The mixtures used in the IAA odor detection test shall be preparedin an area separate from where the test is performed, in order to preventolfactory fatigue in the subject.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. If the test subject is unable to correctly identify the jar containingthe odor test solution, the IAA qualitative fit test may not be used.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">11. If the test subject correctly identifies the jar containing theodor test solution, the test subject may proceed to respirator selectionand fit testing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73"> Respirator Selection</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The test subject shall be allowed to pick the most comfortablerespirator from a selection including respirators of various sizes fromdifferent manufacturers. The selection shall include at least three sizesof elastomeric half facepieces, from at least two manufacturers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The selection process shall be conducted in a room separate fromthe fit-test chamber to prevent odor fatigue. Prior to the selection process,the test subject shall be shown how to put on a respirator, how it shouldbe positioned on the face, how to set strap tension and how to determinea ``comfortable'' respirator. A mirror shall be available to assist thesubject in evaluating the fit and positioning of the respirator. This instructionmay not constitute the subject's formal training on respirator use, asit is only a review.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The test subject should understand that the employee is being askedto select the respirator which provides the most comfortable fit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The test subject holds each facepiece up to the face and eliminatesthose which obviously do not give a comfortable fit. Normally, selectionwill begin with a half-mask and if a comfortable fit cannot be found, thesubject will be asked to test the full facepiece respirators. (A smallpercentage of users will not be able to wear any half-mask.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. The more comfortable facepieces are noted; the most comfortablemask is donned and worn at least five minutes to assess comfort. All donningand adjustments of the facepiece shall be performed by the test subjectwithout assistance from the test conductor or other person. Assistancein assessing comfort can be given by discussing the points in andplusmin;6below. If the test subject is not familiar with using a particular respirator,the test subject shall be directed to don the mask several times and toadjust the straps each time to become adept at setting proper tension onthe straps.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6.

The test subject shall perform the conventional negative or positive-pressurefit checks (e.g., see ANSI Z88.2-1980A7). Before beginning the negative-or positive-pressure test, the subject shall be told to ``seat'' the maskby rapidly moving the head from side-to-side and up and down, while takinga few deep breaths.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. The test subject is now ready for fit testing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. After passing the fit test, the test subject shall be questionedagain regarding the comfort of the respirator. If the respirator has becomeuncomfortable, another model of respirator shall be tried.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">11. The employee shall be given the opportunity to select a differentfacepiece and to be retested if the chosen facepiece becomes increasinglyuncomfortable at any time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">C. Fit Test</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The fit test chamber shall be similar to a clear 55 gallon drumliner suspended inverted over a 2-foot diameter frame, so that the topof chamber is about 6 inches above the test subject's head. The insidetop center of the chamber shall have a small hook attached.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Each respirator used for the fitting and fit testing shall be equippedwith organic vapor cartridges or offer protection against organic vapors.The cartridges or canisters shall be replaced as necessary to maintainthe effectiveness of the respirator.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. After selecting, donning, and properly adjusting a respirator,the test subject shall wear it to the fit testing room. This room shallbe separate from the room used for odor threshold screening and respiratorselection, and shall be well ventilated, as by an exhaust fan or lab hood,to prevent general room contamination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. A copy of the following test exercises and Rainbow Passage shallbe taped to the inside of the test chamber:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Test Exercises</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">i. Breath normally.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">ii. Breath deeply. Be certain breaths are <T3>deep</T3> and <T3>regular</T3>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">iii. Turn head all the way from one side to the other. Inhale on eachside. Be certain movement is complete. Do not bump the respirator againstthe shoulders.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">iv. Nod head up-and-down. Inhale when head is in the full up position(looking toward ceiling). Be certain motions are complete and made aboutevery second. Do not bump the respirator on the chest.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">v. Talking. Talk aloud and slowly for several minutes. The followingparagraph is called the Rainbow Passage. Reading it aloud will result ina wide range of facial movements, and thus be useful to satisfy this requirement.Alternative passages which serve the same purpose may also be used.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">vi. Jog in place.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">vii. Breathe normally.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Rainbow Passage</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like a prismand form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into manybeautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its pathhigh above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, accordingto legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one everfinds it. When a man looks for something beyond reach, his friends sayhe is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Each test subject shall wear the respirator for at least 10 minutesbefore starting the fit test.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. Upon entering the test chamber, the test subject shall be givena 6 inch by 5 inch piece of paper towel or other porous absorbent singleply material, folded in half and wetted with three-quarters of one cc ofpure IAA. The test subject shall hang the wet towel on the hook at thetop of the chamber.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. Allow two minutes for the IAA test concentration to be reachedbefore starting the fit-test exercises.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. Each exercise described in andplusmin;4 above shall be performedfor at least one minute.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. If at any time during the test, the subject detects the banana-likeodor of IAA, the test has failed. The subject shall quickly exit from thetest chamber and leave the test area to avoid olfactory fatigue.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. If the test is failed, the subject shall return to the selectionroom and remove the respirator, repeat the odor sensitivity test, selectand put on another respirator, return to the test chamber, and again beginthe procedure described in the (C)4 through (C)8 above. The process continuesuntil a respirator that fits well has been found. Should the odor sensitivitytest be failed, the subject shall wait about 5 minutes before retesting.Odor sensitivity will usually have returned by this time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">11. If a person cannot pass the fit test described above wearing ahalf-mask respirator from the available selection, full facepiece modelsmust be used.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">12. When a respirator is found that passes the test, the subject mustbreak the faceseal and take a breath before exiting the chamber. This isto assure that the reason the test subject is not smelling the IAA is thegood fit of the respirator facepiece seal and not olfactory fatigue.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">13. When the test subject leaves the chamber, the subject shall removethe saturated towel and return it to the person conducting the test. Tokeep the area from becoming contaminated, the used towels shall be keptin an self-sealing bag so there is no significant IAA concentration buildupin the test chamber during subsequent tests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">14. Persons who have successfully passed this fit test with a half-maskrespirator may be assigned the use of the test respirator in atmosphereswith up to 10 times the PEL. In atmospheres greater than 10 times, andless than 50 times the PEL (up to 50 ppm), the subject must pass the IAAtest using a full face negative pressure respirator. (The concentrationof the IAA inside the test chamber must be increased by five times forQLFT of the full facepiece.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">15. The test shall not be conducted if there is any hair growth betweenthe skin and the facepiece sealing surface.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">16. If hair growth or apparel interfere with a satisfactory fit, thenthey shall be altered or removed so as to eliminate interference and allowa satisfactory fit. If a satisfactory fit is still not attained, the testsubject must use a positive-pressure respirator such as a powered air-purifyingrespirator, supplied air respirator, or self-contained breathing apparatus.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">17. If a test subject exhibits difficulty in breathing during thetests, she or he shall be referred to a physician trained in respiratorydiseases or pulmonary medicine to determine whether the test subject canwear a respirator while performing her or his duties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">18. Qualitative fit testing shall be repeated at least every 12 months.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">19. In addition, because the sealing of the respirator may be affected,qualitative fit testing shall be repeated immediately when the test subjecthas a:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Weight change of 20 pounds or more,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Significant facial scarring in the area of the facepiece seal,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Significant dental changes; i.e.; multiple extractions withoutprothesis, or acquiring dentures,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Reconstructive or cosmetic surgery, or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Any other condition that may interfere with facepiece sealing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">D.

The entire screening and testing procedure shall be explained tothe test subject prior to conducting the screening test.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. During the threshold screening test, the test subject shall donthe test enclosure and breathe with open mouth with tongue extended.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Using a DeVilbiss Model 40 Inhalation Medication Nebulizer or equivalent,the test conductor shall spray the threshold check solution into the enclosure.This nebulizer shall be clearly marked to distinguish it from the fit testsolution nebulizer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. The threshold check solution consists of 0.83 grams of sodium saccharin,USP in water. It can be prepared by putting 1 cc of the test solution (seeC 7 below) in 100 cc of water.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. To produce the aerosol, the nebulizer bulb is firmly squeezed sothat it collapses completely, then is released and allowed to fully expand.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. Ten squeezes of the nebulizer bulb are repeated rapidly and thenthe test subject is asked whether the saccharin can be tasted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. If the first response is negative, ten more squeezes of the nebulizerbulb are repeated rapidly and the test subject is again asked whether thesaccharin can be tasted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. If the second response is negative ten more squeezes are repeatedrapidly and the test subject is again asked whether the saccharin can betasted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">11. The test conductor will take note of the number of squeezes requiredto elicit a taste response.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">12. If the saccharin is not tasted after 30 squeezes (Step 10), thesaccharin fit test cannot be performed on the test subject.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">13. If a taste response is elicited, the test subject shall be askedto take note of the taste for reference in the fit test.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">14. Correct use of the nebulizer means that approximately 1 cc ofliquid is used at a time in the nebulizer body.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">15. The nebulizer shall be thoroughly rinsed in water, shaken dry,and refilled at least every four hours.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">C. Fit Test </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.
