Venezuela didn't garner any new loans as part of the debt restructuring it agreed to in February; it only received banks' assurances that they would make such loans. The Venezuelan government has decided that it wants firmer commitments from banks that they will lend new money before it signs the debt restructuring.    Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua, accompanied by the head of the nation's investment fund and another senior government financial official, were expected to arrive in Washington late yesterday, bankers said.    After meetings with the new Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other U.S. officials today, the Venezuelans are expected to travel to New York for a breakfast meeting with the heads of several major U.S. banks tomorrow. A Fed spokesman confirmed Mr. Azpurua's meeting with Mr. Greenspan.    Venezuela's proposed debt restructuring covers almost all the country's medium-term and long-term foreign bank debt. The country's total foreign debt was $34.1 billion at the end of 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
