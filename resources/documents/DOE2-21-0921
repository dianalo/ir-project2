For the improvement of anti-pressurecapability to protect electrolyte and fuel gas from leaking, packingsand sealing agents of fluorine series proved to resist the pressure of5 kg/cm{sup 2} or higher. As regards the recycling of gas, a system whichemployed a diaphragm has been investigated. An electronic computer wasused for numerical analysis to study the optimization of heat dissipationmethod. When the pressures of 1 atm. hydrogen and oxygen were increasedby about 4 kg/cm{sup 2} for a cell with electrodes of 12.5 cm{sup 2}effective area at 1 atm., the output of the cell was found to be doubledto 0.5W/cm{sup 2}. It was clarified that it would be possible to makea high performance cell with over 1.0A output at 0.6V by improving theproduction system of electrodes. (2 figs, 1 phot)</TEXT></DOC>
