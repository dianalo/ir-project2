When the coated fibers are exposed to hydrogen, a hydrideis formed with an expanded lattice constant, which stretches the opticalfiber. This change in optical path length is measured using a Mach--Zehnderinterferometer. A simple one-dimensional model is presented and shownto accurately reproduce the fiber response. Using electrodeposited palladiumfilms, a factor of 7 enhancement in the hydrogen solubility is observed,as well as a deeply bound site which is saturated in the parts per millionconcentration range. The data suggest that this site may be due to hydrogenbinding to a free surface of the palladium.</TEXT></DOC>
