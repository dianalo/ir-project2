The two Soviet grandmasters are now tied 8.5 points each withthe next game scheduled for Saturday. A win counts for a point, atie for a half-point.   Kasparov had gone ahead Tuesday when he won the marathon 16thgame after 102 moves played over four days. But Karpov, with thewhite pieces on Wednesday, evened the match.   The first player to gain 12.5 points wins the championship and$1.7 million of a $3 million purse. In the event of a tie, Kasparovretains the title. The first 12 games were played in New York.   After forcing Kasparov's resignation Wednesday, Karpov said,``It was a very complicated game, but I felt I always had theadvantage.''   The game began with a familiar scenario. As the two previousgames in Lyon with Karpov playing white, the opening was a Grunfeldwith an exchange variation as Kasparov castled on the eighth move.But Karpov moved his knight into deeper territory on the 10th move.   That caused Kasparov almost 30 minutes of reflection beforecountering with a pawn exchange, then bringing a knight forward.   Each player is allowed 2{ hours for his first 40 moves.   Karpov wasted his time advantage on the 25th move when he had todecide how to capture a black knight. He finally did so with abishop.   At that point, both players had less than 30 minutes for 15moves.   The game turned in Karpov's favor when he advanced a queen andestablished a rook deep in black territory.   Kasparov tried to get out of trouble, but Karpov kept advancing.Karpov even moved a pawn to the seventh rank, blocking the blackqueen and attacking a rook.   Kasparov gave up two moves later.</TEXT></DOC>
