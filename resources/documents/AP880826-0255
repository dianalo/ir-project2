LloydBentsen has voted against the majority of his Democratic colleaguesin the Senate on a variety of issues, including Star Wars, abortionand immigration policy, and some of his votes put him at odds withhis running mate, Michael Dukakis.   When 77 percent of Senate Democrats voted on Feb. 4 againstgranting $60 million to rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government,Bentsen was on the opposite side. On July 13, 75 percent ofDemocrats voted against allowing oil drilling in parts of theeastern Gulf of Mexico, but Bentsen voted for it.   Those votes were an exception for the Texas senator, who now ishis party's nominee for vice president.   During 17{ years in the Senate he has usually been found in themiddle of the pack. Of 212 substantive votes Bentsen has cast thisyear, 185, or 87 percent, sided with the majority of Democrats.   In 1987, Bentsen voted on 408 roll calls, and 90 percent of thetime _ on 365 votes _ he sided with most other Democrats.   Averaging his annual ratings by the Americans for DemocraticActas,'' Bentsen hassaid, referring to the leftist government in Nicaragua.   Dukakis favors federal financing of abortions. Bentsen calls theissue one of the toughest for him but generally supports federalmoney only in the case of rape or incest or when the mother's lifewould be endangered by carrying a baby to term.   On the basic question of abortion, Bentsen says, ``It's awoman's right to make that decision after consulting her physician,hopefully her pastor or priest.''   Dukakis apparently is unequivocally opposed to capitalpunishment. Bentsen has voted for it, most recently on May 16, whenthe Senate approved the death penalty for certain drug-relatedmurders. More than half the Democrats opposed that bill.   Dukakis favors handgun control; Bentsen is on the other side. Onthe most recent vote on the issue, in 1987, Bentsen opposed anamendment prohibiting firearms that cannot be detected by airportsecurity devices. Seventy-four percent of Democratic senators votedfor the amendment.   Dukakis and Bentsen appear unconcerned about their differences.``I didn't pick Lloyd Bentsen to be a clone of Michael Dukakis,''the presidential nominee explained. ``We agree on most things butwe disagree on some.''   Bentsen was in the minority on April 20 when the Senate, on a61-35 vote, killed an amendment that would have required a balancedfederal budget before any financial reparations could be paid toJapanese-Americans interned during World War II. Only eight otherDemocrats were with Bentsen on that vote.   Bentsen later voted for the reparations bill, which passed 69-27.   More than two-thirds of Democrats favored a six-month extensionof the amnesty period during which illegal immigrants could applyfor legalization. But Bentsen voted with most Republicans and theextension failed, 56-40.   Bentsen, whose state's energy industry is in deep trouble, votedJuly 13 to allow the Interior Department to approve drilling onexisting leases in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The amendment failed59-37, with 75 percent of Democrats voting no.   On 150 of the 212 substantive votes this year, Bentsen voted onthe same side as Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginiaand liberal Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. On 17occasions, Bentsen was aligned against the two; he was allied withByrd against Kennedy on 23 votes; on eight he sided with Kennedyagainst Byrd.   Bentsen has consistently been among a minority of Democrats onkey defense issues; he has been considerably more hawkish.   On the 27 votes this year in which Bentsen was opposed by mostmembers of his party, six were on major defense questions,including the MX mobile missile, the Strategic Defense Initiative(he opposed cuts in both; Dukakis opposes SDI, also known as StarWars), and on requiring the mothballing of two aging aircraftcarriers when their replacements are commissioned (he opposed it).   Some other key Bentsen votes this year:   _Down the line against conservative efforts to modify theU.S.-Soviet INF arms treaty.   _For the Grove City civil rights restoration bill and mostattempts to weaken it. Against most Democrats, he supportedamendments involving abortion and schools controlled by religiousorganizations.   _For a bill generally prohibiting employers from using liedetectors on employees.   _For legislation prohibiting a president from withholdingdetails of covert operations from Congress.   _Against a resolution disapproving a U.S.-Japanese agreement onpeaceful uses of nuclear energy.   _For three major bills that he, as chairman of the FinanceCommittee, shepherded through the Senate: Welfare overhaul,Medicare benefits for some expenses of catastrophic illness (with atax increase on the elderly to pay for them) and a sweeping tradebill.   _For an amendment requiring that government AIDS-relatedliterature emphasize abstinence from illegal drug use and from sexoutside a monogamous marriage.   _Against stripping federal courts of authority in casesinvolving disputes about school prayer.   _For requiring that lucrative ``golden parachute'' benefits forcorporate executives be subject to stockholder approval.   _Against requiring written parental consent before governmentclinics may provide contraceptives to minors.   _For creating a Department of Veterans Affairs in the Cabinet.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Aug 29</NOTE></DOC>
