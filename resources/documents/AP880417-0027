Michael Dukakis would shoot down theMidgetman missile and hire more tax collectors. Albert Gore Jr.would consider a tax on luxuries, but supports some weapons hisrivals oppose.   The budget and defense policy are not the only areas in whichthe three surviving challengers for the Democratic presidentialnomination differ. Among the others: abortion, education, taxes andthe Middle East.   The Middle East, particularly, has been a topic of considerableconcern as the candidates head into Tuesday's New York primary. In1984, Jews cast 23 percent of the votes in that contest.   Jackson, the civil rights activist, has taken the mostconsistently liberal stands on foreign and domestic issues, and hasoffered more specifics on how he would grapple with the federalbudget deficit.   Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, also has embraced manyliberal social ideas, including universal health insurance, but hassuggested that taxpayer costs can be minimized by forgingpartnerships with the private sector.   Gore has staked out the more conservative stances on militaryand foreign policy issues, and has been the most outspokensupporter of Israel and opponent of a Palestinian state. He hasgained expertise on arms control during 12 years in Congress, wherehe has compiled a liberal voting record on labor, environment andhealth issues.   Here is a look at where the Democrats stand on key issues:</TEXT><HEAD>TAXES</HEAD><TEXT>      Jackson would make the wealthiest 600,000 taxpayers pay at arate of 38.5 percent instead of the current top of 28 to 33percent. He also would boost corporate taxes back to 1970s levels.   Dukakis says, ``No serious candidate for president can rule outthe possibility of new taxes.'' But he says the first step is tohire more Internal Revenue Service agents and ``collect everydollar we can of that $110 billion that's not being paid today.''   Gore has favored a top marginal tax rate of 33 percent for thosemaking more than $200,000 a year. ``If we are driven as a lastresort to new taxes, I will fight to ensure that we turn first tothose who can afford it,'' says Gore, who has suggested raisingnearly $1 billion with a 5 percent tax on luxury items, $10 billionby keeping corporate taxes at their current level and $5 billion bytaxing the sale of inherited stocks on the basis of their originalvalue.   Jackson supports an oil import fee; Gore has not ruled one out.Dukakis is a vociferous opponent of such a tariff.</TEXT><HEAD>BUDGET DEFICIT</HEAD><TEXT>      Jackson claims he could reduce the deficit by $100 billionannually by 1993 by freezing Pentagon spending for five years andby his tax increases on the wealthy. But he has also proposed majorincreases in social spending.   Dukakis would scale back Star Wars research and save $50 billionby scrapping the Midgetman missile. He says he would trim federalprograms and squeeze out waste, but cautions, ``We're not going toget major cuts out of the domestic side of the budget. It's beensavaged over the past seven years.''   Gore says he would ``convene a summit of our nation's leaders oneconomics to forge a national consensus on how best to tackle ourbudget deficit.'' He proposed eliminating subsidies for junk mail,cutting corporate farm subsidies and eliminating ``the $40 billionof unnecessary medical diagnostics'' that the government pays foreach year.</TEXT><HEAD>MILITARY</HEAD><TEXT>      All three candidates oppose the Strategic Defense Initiative.Dukakis and Gore would scale back basic research in the field topre-Star Wars levels.   Jackson proposes saving $40 billion by not building two newaircraft carrier task forces, and ``tens of billions of dollars''by negotiating further arms reductions with the Soviets. He opposesbuilding the Midgetman missile, the Stealth bomber, the Trident D-5missile, or any more MX missiles.   Dukakis opposes the Midgetman. He contends that until the UnitedStates and Soviets can agree on reducing conventional forces,savings on strategic weapons must be invested in strengthening U.S.non-nuclear forces.   Dukakis opposes the B-1 bomber, but favors development of theStealth bomber.   Gore is a stalwart supporter of the single-warhead Midgetmanmissile, and helped win congressional approval for it in exchangefor limiting production of the multi-warhead MX missile to 50.   Like his rivals, Gore opposed military aid to the Contras, buthas voted in the past for humanitarian aid for the Nicaraguanrebels. Gore fought Reagan administration efforts to revive the B-1bomber, then voted to limit production to 100.</TEXT><HEAD>MIDDLE EAST</HEAD><TEXT>      Gore does not support creation of a Palestinian state. Dukakishas refused to rule it out. Jackson supports an independenthomeland for Palestians. All three say the Arab nations mustrecognize Israel's right to exist.   Jackson, who once met with Palestinian Liberation Organizationleader Yasser Arafat, now says he would not do it again. But hecalls current U.S. policy ``fatally flawed'' and favors ``aninternational conference on the Middle East involving all theparties concerned, including the chosen representatives of thePalestinian people.''   Dukakis has said Arab leaders' refusal to negotiate with Israelis to blame for the current Palestinian strife; he says Israelshould not be forced to relinquish all the land won in the 1967 war.   Gore refused to join 30 Senate colleagues in sending a letter ofprotest to the Israel government on its handling of the unrest;Dukakis has said he would have signed the letter.</TEXT><HEAD>ABORTION</HEAD><TEXT>      Dukakis and Jackson fully support women's legal right toabortion and federal funding for abortions.   Gore opposes a constitutional ban on abortions, but has voted tolimit federal tax dollars for abortions.</TEXT><HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD><TEXT>      Jackson would double the $21 billion Department of Educationbudget and expand Head Start and other programs so that alldisadvantaged children could take part.   Dukakis has proposed scholarships to attract more students intoteaching, and new tax breaks for families to save for college.   Gore as called for more federal support for schools and HeadStart, but also suggested a longer school year and that teachers bemore accountable.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
