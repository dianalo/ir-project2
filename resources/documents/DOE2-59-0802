These techniques will make it possible,for example, to transfer genes conferring resistance to insecticidesinto the genome of beneficial species, or to develop new methods of combatinginsect pests and disease carrying insects. We cloned two genes whichcontain the code for proteins that detoxify insecticides. The first,esterase B1 from Culex quinquefasciatus, is amplified approximately 250times in Californian mosquitoes resistant to organic phosphate insecticides.A second esterase gene was cloned from bacteria which break down variousorganic phosphates. Experiments are in progress to transfer these genesto Drosophila and beneficial insects. These same genes could also serveas selection markers for the purpose of developing transformation techniquesfor different insects whose genome one wishes to modify using geneticengineering techniques.
