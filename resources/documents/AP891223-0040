The coldest dawn on record broke over some U.S. cities but the``Siberian Express'' that whistled over the pole through the Yukonand stalled in the Midwest should be jump-started over the weekendby a warm front trickling over the Rockies.   Snow was falling or forecast from central Florida to theCarolinas and west fo Mississippi, but in other areas east of theRockies today's lows should be followed by a pre-Christmas respite.   Wilmington, N.C. had more than 4 inches of snow on the groundthis morning and up to 8 inches was forecast by afternoon, farsurpassing the record for the date. The snow closed the coastalcity's airport.   In Nebraska, the weekend forecast called for Christmas Daytemperatures in the 40s, seemingly tropical compared with the40-plus below recorded Friday morning.   The cold snap has caused at least 67 weather-related deathsaround the country.   Snow flurries whitened the Florida Panhandle cities ofPensacola, Tallahassee, Apalachicola, Milton and Crestview earlytoday, said Brian Maher of the National Weather Service.   Up to 4 inches of snow were forecast for Jacksonville, where theall-time record is 2 inches. Southern Florida, which has escapedthe cold until now, was due for a snap, with a freeze forecastSunday in Miami.   ``People are pouring in,'' said Jeanetta Pratt of the CityRescue Mission in Jacksonville. ``We don't turn anyone away. ... Wewill find a place for them.''   Citrus growers were nervous, jogged by memories of the $3billion in damages from hard freezes in 1983 and 1985.   ``The timing is not good. We have a lot of fruit on the treesand a lot of concerned growers,'' said Dick Whalley of FloridaCitrus Mutual in Lakeland.   Texas' $30 million citrus industry was also threatened.   A sheet of ice and up to 2 inches of snow today coveredGeorgia's Golden Isles, normally a holiday haven of winter golfamong the palm trees. Officials closed ice-covered causeways,cutting off three of the islands from the mainland.   Cold records were snapped in more than 125 cities Friday. A lowof 23 degrees below zero made it the coldest day ever in KansasCity, Mo.   At Rochford, high in the black hills of South Dakota, theunofficial reading was 60 degrees below zero. The weather service'sofficial low was 47 degrees below zero at Broadus and Hardin, Mont.   The all-time record low in the United States is 80 below atProspect Creek, Alaska, on Jan. 23, 1971. And in New York City,where it was a brisk 8 Friday morning, a Soviet emigrant said hewasn't impressed.   ``This is nothing,'' said Dora Romadinov. ``In Moscow it's muchcolder. Look, there's no snow! The sun is out!''   The rags-and-riches atmosphere of midtown Manhattan took on aparticularly poignant air, with many of the city's 80,000 homelesspeople crowding into shelters and train and subway stations to keepwarm, cheek by jowl with well-dressed Christmas shoppers bustlingfrom boutiques.   A homeless man in tennis shoes fished for spare coins in afountain; across the street families traipsed into Radio City MusicHall for the Christmas show.   Outside City Hall, demonstrators erected four tombstones to markthe deaths of four homeless people who died of exposure whilesleeping in subways last weekend.   ``These tragic deaths have gone virtually unnoticed, and we moreaffluent New Yorkers seem to have let our hearts grow colder andmore hardened than the bitter winter,'' said David Beseda of theCoalition for the Homeless.   Around the country thousands were without heat or power becauseof outages caused by overdrawn current, ice on the power lines andother problems. Heating oil shortfalls were reported at terminalsthroughout the Northeast.   At the Southeast Kansas Branch Experiment Station near Parsons,the cold was making it difficult to keep water for the cattle fromfreezing. Luckily none of the cows at the station were about togive birth.   ``It would be a rude awakening to come into the world now,''said station head Lyle Thomas. ``That would be quite a temperaturedrop.''   Records lows Friday included Pittsburgh at 12 below; Tulsa 6below; Oklahoma City at 4 below; Denver at 18 below, andScottsbluff, Neb., at 42 below.   ``Records are nice, but who the hell wants to stick around whenthey're there?'' said George Matuella of the weather service inOmaha, Neb.</TEXT></DOC>
