In lightof America's inattention to civil defense since the aftermath of theCuban missile crisis, numerous implications have been drawn from allegedSoviet plans and capabilities to undertake crisis relocation of urbanpopulations, to disperse and harden industry, and to achieve rapid postattackrecovery. Most serious among these implications is the potential effectof Soviet civil defense capabilities upon the real or perceived stabilityof deterrence. Specifically, some contend that the Soviet civil defenseprogram threatens deterrence by upsetting the balance of mutual populationvulnerability if, under certain conditions, Soviet civil defense measuresmight limit their fatalities to the low &quot;tens of millions.&quot; Furthermore,it is frequently argued that Soviet civil defense capabilities couldthreaten deterrence stability to the degree that they protect that country'seconomic power and recovery prospects relative to those of the UnitedStates. Those who are concerned about Soviet civil defense improvementsare also frequently among those concerned over the comparative lack ofUS civil defense measures. Often these critics contend that there areseveral additional implications that result from the inability of theUnited States to protect its citizens or production base from nuclearassaults. This paper (1) examines the effectiveness of the Soviet civildefense program, selected Soviet strategic vulnerabilities, and Sovietviews of deterrence, an (2) evaluates the direction and scope of thecurrent US civil defense program.</TEXT></DOC>
