GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thailand, which has been criticized forrejecting boat people, will expand a refugee center in order toaccommodate up to 10,000 arrivals, officials said Friday.   But to prevent a flood of escapees from Vietnam, those housed atthe center will not be eligible for resettlement in thirdcountries, the officials said.   ``The door has been somewhat opened,'' said one official,speaking on condition of anonymity. However, he said Thailand'srecent policy of turning back Vietnamese boat people could bereinstated and that in some cases it was still being carried out.   Thailand was criticized by some international aid agencies andthe U.S. government for pushing Vietnamese boats back out to sea.Some reports have claimed that 100 to 170 refugees may have drownedafter their boats were turned away from Thailand early this year.   Thai officials, speaking at a background briefing, said Thailandadopted tough measures because Western governments were not livingup to their agreement to accept the refugees.   They also said there was no end in sight to the flow ofimmigrants and the new arrivals were ``economic migrants'' ratherthan people fleeing persecution.   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said thetough stance had been modified because of ``hopeful signs,''including a greater movement of refugees from Thailand to theUnited States and a growing realization by the internationalcommunity that Indochinese refugees had to be resettled.   They indicated that Thailand was also unhappy about the adversepublicty surrounding the rejection of the boat people.   The officials said an annex was being constructed at Site 2, acamp along the border with Cambodia, to house 8,000 to 10,000Vietnamese. The camp, to be administered by the Thai military,already holds more than 900 Vietnamese boat people and 4,000 whofled Vietnam by land and crossed Cambodia.   About 2,600 Vietnamese now along the Thai coast will be moved tothe Site 2 annex.   Another 15,000 Vietnamese are being housed at Phanat Nikhom, atransit center for Indochinese refugees, including Cambodians andLaotians.   This center is to be closed to new Vietnamese arrivals andpressure will be exerted on the United States and other countriesto accept those currently there, the officials said.   ``Thirteen years after the Vietnam war we have gone beyond acertain threshold,'' one official said. ``Those now coming are notthe traditional boat people. Most are looking for better economicopportunities.''   The Thai government ordered the Vietnamese boats turned awaywhen the numbers of refugees jumped dramatically at the end of lastyear and rose to 2,500 in January 1988 alone.   Many arrived via Cambodia with the aid of smugglers.   The officials said reports of deaths had been exaggerated. Theysaid less than 100 Vietnamese perished and fewer than 20 bodies hadbeen recovered in Thai waters.   ``It was never the willful or malicious intent of the royal Thaigovernment to cause harm or injury to Vietnamese asylum-seekers,''the background paper said.   Thailand has since 1975 provided temporary refuge for over 1million Indochinese refugees.   The Vietnamese are regarded as illegal immigrants, but a largenumber have in the past been allowed by local authorities to landwithout problems.   The officials indicated the law would remain ambiguous althoughthere had been a recent ``softening'' of Thai attitude. Thebackground paper said those who would not be allowed to land onThai shores would be given food, water and fuel and their boatswould be repaired if necessary.   ``A major influx could unravel these new arrangements,'' oneofficial said. He noted that since January, the number of arrivalshad dropped dramatically, but he did not provide a number.</TEXT></DOC>
