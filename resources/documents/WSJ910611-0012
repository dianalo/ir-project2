The BIS annual reportsays Mexico cut its banking debt by $15 billion, or 22%, inthe past year. &quot;At the same time, Mexico added $3.4 billionto its balances outstanding with the banks, and by the end ofthe year, the recorded net claims on Mexico amounted to $29billion,&quot; down about 50% from 1985, the report says.   But Mr. Mancera foresees little prospect for furtherchange in Mexico's public foreign debt outstanding. As Mexicoreplaces maturing debt with new debt, the total outstandingremains about the same, he said.   Mexico's foreign debt is declining relative to grossdomestic product, he said, because of its GDP growth andinflation in the U.S. and other countries.                                                                                                          REBUILDING LEBANON AND ANGOLA                                                                                                          Lebanon and Angola, each climbing out of 16-year civilwars, spelled out international aid needs to rebuild basicservices. United Nations envoy Bettino Craxi, a formerItalian prime minister, said he would coordinate plans tohelp reconstruction in Lebanon. Beirut is seekingmultimillion-dollar long-term loans to financereconstruction. Angola said it needs $500 millionimmediately. The first phase of Angola's plannedrehabilitation program totals $2 billion.                                                                                                          EC SANCTIONS ON SOUTH AFRICA                                                                                                          African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela pleadedwith the European Community to maintain sanctions againstSouth Africa, saying accords between Pretoria andanti-apartheid forces haven't been fully enforced. InBrussels, Mr. Mandela expressed regret about EC decisions tolift the ban on direct investments in South Africa, to easesanctions gradually and to end its embargo on certain SouthAfrican imports.                                                                                                          CANADA GETS TOUGH ON IMPORTS                                                                                                          Canada announced tougher penalties on shoppers caughtsmuggling goods bought in the U.S., particularly alcohol andtobacco products. The purpose is to &quot;help level the playingfield for Canadian retailers trying to compete with theirAmerican counterparts,&quot; an official said. Penalties forfailing to declare such goods will be based on the products'value, rather than duties and taxes evaded.                                                                                                          FOOD INDUSTRY MONTHLY LAUNCHED                                                                                                          World Food Regulation Review, an international publicationon food safety and other food policy issues, was launched byBureau of National Affairs Inc., a publishing concern basedin Washington, D.C., and its BNA International unit. Themonthly will analyze effects of regulatory changes and othertechnical, legal, marketing and production issues.                                                                                                          BRAZILIAN DAM IS STALLED                                                                                                          Two years after 200 square miles of Amazon rain forestwere flooded by the Samuel hydroelectric dam, it sometimescan't produce enough electricity even for the offices on itsflanks, ecologists said. Officials blamed a lack of fundsthat stopped construction, leaving the dam short ofpower-generating equipment.   The dam, intended to provide low-cost energy to citiesdesperately short of it, could become another embarrassmentin a series of hydroelectric projects in the Amazon, asBrazil is trying to brighten its environmental image ahead ofits hosting a United Nations-sponsored conference on thesubject a year from now.   Samuel, on the Janari River 34 miles south of the statecapital Porto Velho, is one of four dams built in the Amazonin the past decade by the government's regional energycompany Electronorte. The dams, funded by the World Bank,were among many ambitious projects conceived by Brazil'sformer military government to open up the Amazon.   At Samuel, which has cost $692 million, only two of fiveplanned turbines were installed and their reliability hasbeen questioned.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          Construction of Eurodisneyland outside Paris is onschedule, and the amusement park will be ready to open nextApril 12, Eurodisney said in a report for its first halfended March 31. It said 5,000 hotel rooms have beencompleted, and park attractions are expected to be in placeby December. . . . The 12 European Community member nationsagain failed to agree on bringing their national value-addedand excise tax rates closer together, in preparation formarket unification at the end of 1992. Members' differencesover rates for tobacco and alcohol excise taxes blocked thetalks, which resume June 24.</TEXT></DOC>
