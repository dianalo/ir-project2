The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.75 to 3013.86 inactive trading. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index dropped1.24 to 389.32. But small stocks continued to post gains withthe Nasdaq Composite Index adding 1.93 to 509.39, a scant1.92 points shy of its record 511.31</LP><TEXT>   Stock prices surged briefly in early trading, pushing theDow Jones industrials past its record close of 3035.33 setJune 3. But traders said when it became evident shortly afternoon that the Treasury's sale of $12 billion of new 30-yearbonds wouldn't go well, sell programs drove stock pricessharply lower. At one point, the Dow Jones industrials wasoff more than 22 points.   The Treasury auction dominated yesterday's stock marketaction, and the poor results surprised many investors, comingas they did on the heels of the warm reception given theTreasury's sale of $14 billion in three-year notes Tuesdayand $12 billion of 10-year notes Wednesday. Long-term bondprices lost nearly half a point yesterday, pushing the yieldon the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond up to 8.23%.   But with the Treasury's big quarterly refunding operationnow completed, many money managers and analysts are confidentthat stock prices will move higher in coming weeks.   &quot;We think the risk of a significant decline is rather lowat this point and that prices are much more likely to rise,&quot;said A.C. Moore, a portfolio manager at Argus InvestmentManagement. He said he expects interest rates to continuefalling and is even looking for the Federal Reserve to onceagain cut the discount rate -- the interest rate the Fedcharges financial institutions for short-term loans -- beforethe end of the year.   And while much recent economic data has shown that theeconomy is struggling as it emerges from recession, Mr. Mooresaid the anticipation of economic growth and reboundingcorporate earnings over the next year is helping stockprices. &quot;Earnings seem to have bottomed, and we're going tobe seeing some improvement, certainly over the next year,&quot; hesaid.   Mr. Moore conceded that by many measures the stock marketis overvalued. But he said that high valuation is much lessof a problem at the beginning of an economic cycle, like now,than it is when a cycle is ending. &quot;With interest ratespositive and earnings improving over the long term, valuationisn't a serious issue right now,&quot; he said.   The dollar gained modestly as interest rates climbedyesterday. But some currency traders said that if U.S. ratesresume their fall, as many economists expect, the dollar willbe hard pressed to hold its gains. Traders predict additionalpressure on the dollar in coming weeks if the German centralbank raises interest rates, as expected.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices slumped in active trading. Volume on the NewYork Stock Exchange totaled 163.6 million shares. Decliningissues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 800 to 759.                                                                                                          The dollar rose modestly. In late New York trading thecurrency was quoted at 1.7150 marks and 136.25 yen comparedto 1.7102 marks and 135.90 yen Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
