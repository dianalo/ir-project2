Of the two      timbres, a master timbre is set in normal mode and is stored in a first      memory, while a slave timbre is selected in tone mix mode and is stored in      a second memory. Each timbre can be altered as desired. To alter the      master timbre, timbre switches are operated after the mode is temporarily      changed to normal mode. To alter the slave timbre, the timbre switches are      operated in tone mix mode. When the tone mix mode is set, this electronic      musical instrument can permit a player to easily alter tone parameters      such as the volume, pitch and attack delay time of each timbre. </PAL></ABST><PARN> <PAR>  This is a division of application Ser. No. 07/332,802, filed Apr. 3, 1989,      now U.S. Pat. No. 5,044,251. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to an electronic musical instrument, and,      more particularly, to an electronic musical instrument which      simultaneously generates musical tones with two types of timbres by a      single input operation for a musical performance. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Related Art </PAR><PAR>  Conventional synthesizer type electronic musical instruments operate in      various modes that include a tone mix mode which permits simultaneous      generation of tone signals with two timbres at the same pitch by a single      musical input operation. To play music in this tone mix mode, a tone mix      switch on an operation panel must first be activated. Then, a display      section displays characters which indicate the tone mix mode being      selected as well as those characters which indicate various parameters for      each of the first and second musical tones, such as the volume, timbre,      pitch and chorus effect. A player operates a cursor key to move a cursor      through the display of these parameters to the position where the volume      parameter for the first musical tone is displayed, and sets a value key to      set the proper volume level. The player then operates a memory bank key      and a memory number key to select a desired timbre from among those      timbres set in advance in the synthesizer, sets the desired timbre as the      timbre for the first musical tone, and operates the cursor and value keys      to adjust the pitch of the first musical tone. Subsequently, the player      similarly operates the cursor key, value key, memory bank key, memory      number key, etc. to set the volume, timbre, pitch, etc. of the second      musical tone. Accordingly, the player needs to repeatedly operate these      keys in addition to operating the tone mix switch, and thus needs time and      labor to set the parameters of two types of musical tones for musical      performance in tone mix mode. </PAR><PAR>  According to keyboard type conventional electronic musical instruments,      timbre switches associated with different types of timbres for selecting      and setting the first timbre (master timbre), timbre switches associated      with different types of timbres for selecting/setting the second timbre      (slave timbre) and a switch to designate the first or second timbre are      provided on a panel. It is difficult as well as costly to provide so many      timbre switches, etc. on the panel within a limited space. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an electronic      musical instrument which ensures musical performance with a timbre      attained by mixing two types of timbres through a simple timbre setting      operation. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of this invention to provide an electronic musical      instrument in which a timbre designating means sequentially designates a      plurality of timbre data, and inputs them into at least one of a first and      second memory means. </PAR><PAR>  According to a first aspect of the present invention, a timbre setting      device for an electronic musical instrument, for setting a tone signal of      a first-and-second-timbre mixed type, comprises timbre designating means      for sequentially designating a plurality of timbre data; fist memory means      for storing timbre data of said first timbre; second memory means for      storing timbre data of said second timbre: and timbre setting control      means for causing at least one of said first memory means and said second      memory means to store the last of said plurality of timbre data designated      by said timbre designating means. </PAR><PAR>  According to another aspect of the invention, an electronic musical      instrument for generating a tone signal with a first timbre in a normal      mode, and a tone signal with first timbre and a second timbre in a tone      mix mode, comprises mode selecting means for selectively setting one of      said normal mode and said tone mix mode; timbre designating means for      sequentially designating a plurality of timbre data; first memory means      for storing first timbre data of said first timbre; second memory means      for storing second timbre data of said second timbre; timbre setting      control means for causing at least one of said first memory means and said      second memory means to store the last of said plurality of timbre data      designated by said timbre designating means; and tone signal generating      means for generating a tone signal according to the first timbre data in      said first memory means when said normal mode is set by said mode      selecting means and for generating a tone signal according to both said      first timbre data in said first memory means and said second timbre data      in said second memory means when said tone mix mode is set by said mode      selecting means. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIGS. 1 through 7 are for explaining the first embodiment of this invention      as applied to an electronic keyboard instrument, and FIGS. 8 through 14      are for explaining the second embodiment of this invention as applied to      an electronic keyboard instrument.

FIG. 1 is a general circuit diagram of an electronic musical instrument      according to the first embodiment. Keyboard 1 is a play input detecting      means which sends control data about tone generation/stopping and a tone      pitch to a CPU (central processing unit) 2 in a microcomputer when a      player performs a musical operation: key depression or key release. A      function keys/function display section 3 includes function keys operable      for selecting or setting a musical tone, a timbre or the and a display for      indicating the operational status of the function keys, and it exchanges      control signals with the CPU 2. A first sound source 4 and a second sound      source 5 are of the same type; when requested by the CPU 2 to generate      musical tones, these sound sources 4 and 5 read out PCM waveforms for      timbres corresponding to the operation of the function keys from a PCM      waveform memory 6 and prepare musical tones. This memory 6 includes a ROM      in which a plurality of signal waveforms of musical tones are stored in      advance in PCM mode. The first and second sound sources 4 and 5 each      generate a tone signal for a left channel (L) and a tone signal for a      right channel (R) for stereo sound and send them to a left channel mixer 7      and a right channel mixer 8. The tone signals for the left channel are      mixed in the former mixer 7, and the tone signals for the right channel in      the latter mixer 8. The mixed tone signal from the mixer 7 is generated as      a stereo musical tone through a left channel amplifier 9 and a left      channel loud-speaker 10, while the mixed tone signal from the mixer 8 is      generated as a stereo musical tone through a right channel amplifier 11      and a right channel loudspeaker 12. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 illustrates the essential section of the function keys/function      display section 3 shown in FIG. 1. A function key or select key F1 serves      to selectively set one of two types of timbres (hereinafter referred to as      front and back timbres) of each of timbre keys T1 to T5. The individual      timbre keys T1-T5 are assigned with the following front and back timbres: </PAR><PA1>  T1: piano (front) and guitar (back); </PA1><PA1>  T2: harpsichord (front) and trumpet (back); </PA1><PA1>  T3: vibraphone (front) and oboe (back); </PA1><PA1>  T4: organ (front) and violin (back); and </PA1><PA1>  T5: flute (front) and harp (back). </PA1><PAL>  For instance, when the select key F1 is pushed ON to select the front      timbre, an indicator L1 is lit and the timbre keys T1-T5 are then ready to      select and set their front timbres. When the select key F1 is pushed ON      again under this condition, the back timbres can now be selected and an      indicator L2 is lit, setting the timbre keys T1-T5 ready to select and set      their back timbres. In short, the select key F1 functions to switch      between the front timbres and back timbres. </PAL><PAR>  A tone bank key F2 switches musical tone functions when depressed. More      specifically, the tone bank key F2 switches between a normal mode (tone      bank function being OFF) in which a musical tone is generated based on the      first timbre (hereinafter referred to as a master timbre) set by the      select key F1 and timbre keys T1-T5, and a tone mix mode (tone bank      function being ON) in which musical tones with two types of timbres, the      master timbre set in normal mode and another (second) timbre set in a      similar manner (to be described later), are simultaneously generated by a      single key operation. When the tone mix mode is set, an indicator L3 is      lit. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a diagram for explaining a timbre control register incorporated      in the CPU 2; the register comprises a tone bank flag, a master timbre      number register and a slave timbre number register. The tone bank flag is      &quot;1&quot; when the tone bank function is set ON or enabled, and it is &quot;0&quot; when      this function is set OFF or disabled. When the tone bank function is      disabled, the master timbre number register serving as the first memory      means stores one of timbre numbers (0 to 9) of the timbres selected by the      operation of the select key F1 and timbre keys T1-T5. When the tone bank      function is enabled, the slave timbre number register serving as the      second memory means stores one of timbre numbers (0 to 9) of the timbres      similarly selected. FIG. 4 illustrates the correlation between these      timbre numbers and timbre names; timbre numbers 0 to 4 correspond to fine      types of front timbres selected by the select key F1, and timbre numbers 5      to 9 correspond to five types of back timbres selected similarly. </PAR><PAC>  Operation </PAC><PAR>  The operation of the first embodiment will now be described. FIG. 5 is a      general flowchart for the operation by the CPU 2 which starts when power      is supplied to the electronic keyboard instrument according to this      embodiment by turning a power switch ON. When the power switch is thrown      ON, initialization is executed in which, for example, the select key F1 is      set for the front timbre selection, the timbre key T1 is set and the tone      bank key F2 is set for the normal mode or tone bank function disabled      (step S1). Then, it is discriminated whether or not the tone bank function      is set ON or whether or not the tone bank flag is &quot;1&quot; (step S2). In the      above initialization, the decision in step S2 is NO, and when the timbre      number of the master timbre stored in the master timbre number register is      any of 0-4, the indicator L1 is lit to indicate a front timbre being set,      and when the stored timbre number is any of 5-9, the indicator L2 is lit      to indicate a back timbre being set (step S3). If the decision in step S2      is YES, the indicator L1 is lit to indicate a front timbre being set as a      slave timbre when the timbre number of the slave timbre stored in the      slave timbre number register is any of 0-4, and the indicator L2 is lit to      indicate a back timbre being set as the slave timbre when the stored      timbre number is any of 5-9 (step S4). After execution of steps S3 and S4,      a switching process (step S5), which will be described later referring to      FIGS. 6 and 7, will be executed, followed by a keying process (key ON/OFF)      to request tone generation/tone off of the first sound source 4 or second      sound source 5 (step S6). It is then discriminated whether or not the      power switch is turned OFF (step S7). If the decision here is NO, the flow      returns to step S2 and the looped sequence including and following this      step is repeated until the power switch is turned OFF. If the decision in      step S7 is YES, however, the flow is completed. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating the display process of the function      display section 3 executed in the switching process (step S5) in the      general flow shown in FIG. 5. This process starts when the tone bank key      F2 is operated. </PAR><PAR>  First, it is discriminated whether or not &quot;1&quot; is set to the tone bank flag      (step T1). If the decision is YES, which means that the tone bank function      has already been set ON, the tone bank flag is cleared and the indicator      L3 is lit to indicate that the normal mode, not the tone mix mode, is      presently set (step T2). When the timbre number stored in the master      timbre number register is any of 0-4, the indicator L1 is lit to indicate      that one of the front timbres is set as the master timbre by the operation      of the select key F1, and when the stored timbre number is any of 5-9, the      indicator L2 is lit to indicate a back timbre being set by the select key      F1 (step T3), thus completing the flow. </PAR><PAR>  If the decision in step T1 is NO, which means that the tone mix mode is      newly set by the tone bank key F2, a new process associated with the      setting of the tone mix mode needs to be executed. The CPU 2 sets &quot;1&quot; to      the tone bank flag and turns the indicator L3 ON to indicate the tone mix      mode being set (step T4). In the subsequent step T5, when the timbre      number stored in the slave timbre number register is any of 0-4, the      indicator L1 is lit to indicate that one of the front timbres is set as      the slave timbre by the operation of the select key F1, and when the      stored timbre number is any of 5-9, the indicator L2 is lit to indicate a      back timbre being set as the slave timbre, thus completing the flow. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating a timbre setting process executed in the      switching process (step S5) in the general flow shown in FIG. 5, i.e., a      process executed when the select key F1 or any of the timbre keys T1-T5 is      depressed. </PAR><PAR>  First, it is discriminated whether or not &quot;1&quot; is set to the tone bank flag      (step U1). If the decision is YES, which means that the tone bank mode has      been set by the operation of the tone bank key F2, a process for setting a      slave timbre as the second timbre is executed. Then, it is discriminated      whether or not the select key F1 is ON (step U2). If the decision is YES,      it is then discriminated whether or not the indicator L2 is lit to      indicate the back timbre being set (step U3). If the decision in this step      is YES, the indicator L1 is turned ON and the indicator L2 is turned OFF,      and a timbre number acquired by subtracting 5 from the previously stored      timbre number (5-9) is stored in the slave timbre number register (step      U4). Consequently, in place of the back timbre, the associated one of the      front timbres (0-4) is set as the slave timbre. If the decision in step U3      is NO, the indicator L2 is turned ON and the indicator L1 is turned OFF,      and a timbre number acquired by adding 5 to the previously stored timbre      number (0-4) is stored in the slave timbre number register (step U5). As a      result, the associated one of the back timbres (5-9) is set as the slave      timbre in place of the front timbre. </PAR><PAR>  If the decision in step U2 is NO, then it is discriminated whether or not      any of the timbre keys T1-T5 is set ON (step U6). If the decision is NO,      which means that no alteration of timbre setting is necessary, the flow is      completed without execution of any further process. If the decision in      step U6 is YES, however, the flow advances to step U7 (timbre setting      process) where any one of the timbre numbers (0-9) set by the timbre keys      T1-T5 is stored in the slave timbre number register. </PAR><PAR>  The above operational sequence is for setting the slave timbre in      accordance with the setting of the tone mix mode, i.e., setting the second      timbre (slave timbre) with respect to the first timbre (master timbre). </PAR><PAR>  If the decision in step U1 is NO, which means that the normal mode is      presently set, a process for setting the master timbre (first timbre) will      mainly be executed. It is discriminated whether or not the select key F1      is ON (step U8). If the decision is YES, it is then discriminated whether      or not the indicator L2 is lit to indicate the back timbre being set (step      U9). If the decision in this step is YES, the indicator L1 is turned ON      and the indicator L2 is turned OFF, and a timbre number acquired by      subtracting 5 from the previously stored timbre number (5-9) is stored in      the master timbre number register (step U10). If the decision in step U9      is NO, the indicator L2 is turned ON and the indicator L1 is turned OFF,      and a timbre number acquired by adding 5 to the previously stored timbre      number (0-4) is stored in the master timbre number register (step U11). </PAR><PAR>  If the decision in step U8 is NO, then it is discriminated whether or not      any of the timbre keys T1-T5 is set ON (step U12). If the decision is NO,      which means that no alteration of timbre setting is necessary, the flow is      completed without execution of any further process. If the decision in      step U12 is YES, however, the flow advances to step U13 (timbre setting      process) where any one of the timbre numbers (0-9) set by the timbre keys      T1-T5 is stored in the master timbre number register. </PAR><PAR>  The above operational sequence is for setting the master timbre or the      first timbre in accordance with the setting of the normal mode. </PAR><PAR>  A description will now be given of a process for altering only the slave      timbre presently set and leaving the presently-set master timbre intact      under the condition that the aforementioned tone mix mode is set. This      process for altering only the slave timbre is illustrated by the timbre      setting flow shown in FIG. 7. In this case, it is first discriminated      whether or not &quot;1&quot; is set to the tone bank flag (step U1) and steps U2-U7      are then executed in the aforementioned manner to set a new timbre number      corresponding to the slave timbre in the slave timbre number register      through the operation of the select key F1 and timbre keys T1-T5. </PAR><PAR>  A description will now be given of a process for altering the master timbre      which is presently set under the condition that the tone mix mode is set.      This process for altering the master timbre is also illustrated by the      timbre setting flow shown in FIG. 7. In this case, the tone bank key F2 is      set ON again to temporarily release the tone mix mode and the master      timbre is set again in normal mode. In other words, the decision in step      U1 in the flow of FIG. 7 is NO, the normal mode is set, and steps U8-U13      are then executed in the aforementioned manner to set a new timbre number      is set as the master timbre in the master timbre number register through      the operation of the select key F1 and timbre keys T1-T5. Subsequently,      the tone bank key F2 is set ON again to set the tone mix mode. To      additionally alter the slave timbre, the decision in step U1 is made to be      YES as mentioned earlier, and steps U2-U7 are then executed to alter the      slave timbre too. </PAR><PAR>  The keying process (step S6) in the general flow shown in FIG. 5 is not      specific to this embodiment, and is also executed in the prior art; it is      executed when any key on the keyboard 1 is operated. In other words, when      the normal mode is set by the operation of the tone bank key F2, a musical      tone with one of the timbres selectively set by the operation of the      select key F1 and timbre keys T1-T5 is generated from the first sound      source 4 alone, and when the tone mix mode is set by the key F2, a musical      tone with the master timbre is generated from the first sound source 4 and      a musical tone with the slave timbre is generated from the second sound      source 5 at the same time. </PAR><PAR>  According to the first embodiment, as described above, a musical tone with      one type of timbre (master timbre) selectively set by the operation of the      select key F1 and timbre keys T1-T5 is generated in normal mode, and      musical tones with two types of timbres (master and slave timbres)      selectively set by the select key F1 and timbre keys T1-T5 are generated      in tone mix mode to thereby provide a chorus effect with two timbres in      unison. Further, since the desired tone waveform is selectively read out      from the PCM waveform memory 6, in which different tone waveforms are      stored in advance, and is set by the operation of the select key F1 and      timbre keys T1-T5, and since the normal mode and tone mix mode can be      changed from one to the other even during a musical performance, a player      can switch between a musical performance having a chorus effect in tone      mix mode and an ordinary musical performance having one timbre in normal      mode while easily selecting the desired timbre or timbres. This permits      the player to easily carry out a variety of musical performances. </PAR><PAR>  Further, only the slave timbre can be altered in tone mix mode by operating      the select key F1 and timbre keys T1-T5. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, the master timbre can also be altered in tone mix mode by      temporarily releasing this mode, and by setting the mode to the tone mix      mode again, a musical performance with the altered master timbre may be      carried out again in tone mix mode. </PAR><PAC>  Second Embodiment </PAC><PAC>  Arrangement </PAC><PAR>  A description will now be given of the arrangement of the second embodiment      of this invention. The general circuit configuration of the electronic      keyboard instrument according to the second embodiment is basically the      same as that of the electronic keyboard instrument according to the first      embodiment shown in FIG. 1, but differs therefrom in the function      keys/function display section 3. Therefore, only the differences will be      discussed below. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 illustrates the essential section of the function keys/function      display section 3 shown in FIG. 1. Timbre select keys 21-30 correspond to      the timbre keys T1-T5 in the first embodiment, and these keys, when      operated, select data of the timbres of, for example, a piano, electric      piano, pipe organ, vibraphone, harp, brass, strings, electric guitar,      electric bass and fantasy, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  A tone mix key 31, corresponding to the tone bank key F2 in the first      embodiment, is a tone mix mode setting key for generating, in mixed tone,      musical tones with two types of timbres selected by the ON operation of      the timbre select keys 21-30, i.e., the first tone (master timbre) and the      second tone (slave timbre). When this tone mix key 31 is rendered ON, an      indicator 32 is turned ON to indicate the tone mix mode being set. In      effecting the tone mixing, first, one of the timbre select keys 21-30, for      example, key 21, is rendered ON in normal mode, then the tone mix key 31      is rendered ON followed by the ON operation of, for example, the timbre      select key 27. Consequently, PIANO and STRINGS are selected as the master      timbre and slave timbre, respectively, and tone mixing is executed based      on these two timbres. </PAR><PAR>  A tone mix volumeandplus;key 33 and a tone mix volume-key 34 serve to change the      balance of volumes of the previously-selected master and slave timbres for      carrying out the tone mixing of these timbres. These keys 33 and 34 change      the volume of a musical tone with that timbre which is selected after the      tone mix mode has been set by the operation of the tone mix key 31, i.e.,      the volume of the musical tone with the slave timbre in the above case.      More specifically, when the tone mixandplus;key 33 is rendered ON, the volume of      the slave timbre is increased, whereas when the tone mix-key 34 is      operated, this volume is decreased, thereby adjusting the balance of the      volumes of the master and slave timbres. </PAR><PAR>  A tone mix delayandplus;key 35 and a tone mix delay-key 36 serve to change the      attack delay time (tone generation delay time) in the envelope of a      musical tone of the previously-selected slave timbre for carrying out the      tone mixing of this slave timbre and the previously-selected master      timbre. </PAR><PAR>  A tone mix detuneandplus;key 37 and a tone mix detune-key 38 serve to change the      pitch of a musical tone of the previously-selected slave timbre for      carrying out the tone mixing of this slave timbre and the      previously-selected master timbre. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a diagram for explaining a timbre control register incorporated      in the CPU 2; the register comprises a tone mix flag, a master timbre      number register and a slave timbre number register. The tone mix flag is      &quot;1&quot; when the tone mix mode is set, and it is &quot;0&quot; when this mode is      released. When the tone mix mode is released, the master timbre number      register serving as the first memory means stores one of timbre numbers (0      to 9) of the timbres selected by the operation of the timbre select keys      21-30. When the tone mix mode is set, the slave timbre number register      serving as the second memory means stores one of timbre numbers (0 to 9)      of the timbres similarly selected. FIG. 10 illustrates the correlation      between these timbre numbers and timbre names. </PAR><PAC>  Operation </PAC><PAR>  The operation of the second embodiment will now be described. FIG. 11 is a      general flowchart for the operation by the CPU 2 which starts when power      is supplied to the electronic keyboard instrument according to this      embodiment by turning a power switch ON. When the power switch is thrown      ON, initialization is executed in which, for example, the tone mix key 31      is set OFF to select the normal mode (step S2-1). </PAR><PAR>  Subsequently, a switching process (step S2-2), which will be described      later, will be executed, followed by a keying process (key ON/OFF) to      request tone generation/tone off of the first sound source 4 or second      sound source 5 (step S2-3). It is then discriminated whether or not the      power switch is turned OFF (step S2-4). If the decision here is NO, the      flow returns to step S2-2 and the looped sequence including and following      this step is repeated until the power switch is turned OFF. If the      decision in step S2-4 is YES, however, the flow is completed. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating the display process of the function      display section 3 executed in the switching process (step S2-2) in the      general flow shown in FIG. 11. This process starts when the tone mix key      31 is operated. </PAR><PAR>  First, it is discriminated whether or not &quot;1&quot; is set to the tone mix flag      (step T2-1). If the decision is YES, it means that the tone mix key 31 has      already been operated to set the tone mix mode and the present keying      operation releases the tone mix mode. Accordingly, the tone mix flag is      cleared and the indicator 32 is turned OFF (step T2-2). When the decision      in step T2-1 is NO, it means that the tone mix mode is newly set, and the      tone mix flag is set and the indicator 32 is turned ON to indicate the      mode being switched to the tone mix mode (step T2-3). </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 is a flowchart illustrating the timbre setting process of the      function display section 3 executed in the switching process (step S2-2)      in the general flow shown in FIG. 11, i.e., the process executed when any      of the timbre select keys 21-30 is rendered ON. </PAR><PAR>  First, it is discriminated whether or not &quot;1&quot; is set to the tone mix flag      (step U2-1). If the decision is YES, which means that the tone mix mode is      set, a process of mainly setting the slave timbre will be executed. It is      then discriminated whether or not any of the timbre select keys 21-30 is      rendered ON (step U2-2). When the decision in step U2-2 is NO, it means      that no alteration of the slave timbre is necessary, and the flow is      completed. If the decision in this step is YES, any of the timbre numbers      (0-9) specified by the operation of the timbre select keys 21-30 is set in      the slave timbre number register (step U2-3). </PAR><PAR>  If the decision in step U2-1 is YES, which means that the normal mode is      set, a process of mainly setting the master timbre will be executed. It is      then discriminated whether or not any of the timbre select keys 21-30 is      rendered ON (step U2-4). If the decision in step U2-4 is NO, it means that      no alteration of the master timbre is necessary and the flow is completed.      If the decision in this step is YES, any of the timbre numbers (0-9)      specified by the operation of the timbre select keys 21-30 is set in the      master timbre number register (step U2-5). </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 14 is a flowchart for a process for variably setting the properties of      a musical tone, which is included in the switching process (step S2-2) in      the general flow shown in FIG. 11. This process will start when one of the      tone mix volumeandplus;key 33, tone mix volume-key 34, tone mix delayandplus;key 35,      tone mix delay-key 36, tone mix detuneandplus;key 37 and tone mix detune-key 37      is rendered ON. </PAR><PAR>  When the flow starts, the ON operational status of the above various keys      for variably setting tone parameters are scanned (step W1). It is then      discriminated whether or not the operated key is associated with the tone      mix volume (step W2). If the decision is YES, it is then discriminated      whether or not the tone mix mode is presently set (step W3). If the      decision in this step is NO, which means no tone mix mode being presently      set, it is unnecessary to alter the tone parameters and the flow will be      completed without executing any further process. If the decision in step      W3 is YES, the flow advances to step W4 where data to increase the volume      of the slave timbre is set in the second sound source 5 (i.e., increasing      the level data of each step of an envelope waveform) when the operated key      is the tone mix volumeandplus;key 33 or data to decrease this volume is set in      the second sound source 5 (i.e., decreasing the level data of each step of      the envelope waveform) when the tone mix volume-key 34 has been depressed.      The flow is then completed. </PAR><PAR>  If the decision in step W2 is NO, it is discriminated whether or nor the      operated key is associated with the tone mix delay (step W5). If the      decision is YES, it is then discriminated whether or not the tone mix mode      is presently set (step W6). If the decision in this step is NO, it is      unnecessary to alter the tone parameters and the flow will be completed      without executing any further process. If the decision in step W6 is YES,      the flow advances to step W7 where data to increase the attack delay time      of the slave timbre is set in the second sound source 5 when the operated      key is the tone mix delayandplus;key 35 or data to decrease this attack delay      time is set in the second sound source 5 when the tone mix delay-key 36      has been depressed, thereby adjusting the attack delay time of the slave      timbre with respect to that of the master timbre. The flow is then      completed. </PAR><PAR>  If the decision in step W5 is NO, it is discriminated whether or not the      operated key is associated with the tone mix detune (step W8). If the      decision is NO, it is unnecessary to alter an tone parameter and the flow      will be completed without executing any further process. If the decision      in step W8 is YES, however, it is then discriminated whether or not the      tone mix mode is presently set (step W9). If the decision in this step is      NO, it is unnecessary to provide a detune effect to a musical tone and the      flow will be completed without executing any further process. If the      decision in step W9 is YES, the flow advances to step W10 where data to      increase the pitch of the slave timbre is set in the second sound source 5      when the operated key is the tone mix detuneandplus;key 37 or data to decrease      this pitch is set in the second sound source 5 when the tone mix      detune-key 38 has been depressed, thereby adjusting the detune effect      between the slave and master timbres. The flow is then completed. </PAR><PAR>  According to the second embodiment, the process for altering only the slave      timbre and the process for altering the master timbre in tone mix mode are      executed in the same manner as per the first embodiment; their description      will therefore be omitted. </PAR><PAR>  According to the second embodiment, as described above, a musical      performance with one type of timbre (master timbre) selectively set by the      operation of the timbre select keys 21-30 is generated in normal mode, and      musical tones with two types of timbres, this master timbre and another      type of timbre (slave timbre) selectively set by the timbre select keys      21-30, are mixed in tone mix mode to provide a musical performance having      a chorus effect with these two timbres in unison. Further, in tone mix      mode, variable setting of the tone parameters of the slave timbre balances      the volumes of the slave and master timbres, gives a variation in timbre      due to the difference in attack delay time or causes a difference in pitch      between the slave and master timbres. This can permit the player to carry      out a musical performance with a wider variety of tones in tone mix mode. </PAR><PAC>  Modifications </PAC><PAR>  Although in the above embodiments, the first and second sound sources 4 and      5 are separately provided to generate tone signals with difference      timbres, it is possible to use a single sound source which is designed to      simultaneously generate tone signals with different timbres in a      time-shared multiplex process. </PAR><PAR>  Further, according to the above embodiments, stereo signals of the first      timbre of two (right and left) channels, generated from the first sound      source 4, are mixed with stereo signals of the second timbre of two      channels, similarly generated from the second sound source 5, in the left      channel mixer 7 and right channel mixer 8, respectively, and the resultant      signals are generated in stereo as two-channel musical tones with two      types of timbres mixed. However, the instrument may be designed in such a      way that the musical tone with the first timbre generated from the first      sound source 4 and the musical tone with the second timbre generated from      the second sound source 5 are not mixed with each other, but are generated      through the respective right and left channels as separate musical tones,      the former tone being output from the right channel speaker 12 via the      right channel amplifier 11 and the latter being output from the left      channel speaker 10 via the left channel amplifier 9. The separate musical      tones may be generated through the left and right channels instead of      right and left. In this case, the former tone is output from the left      channel speaker 10 via the left channel amplifier 9, while the latter tone      is output from the right channel speaker 12 via the right channel      amplifier 11. In either case, although musical tones with two type of      timbres are mixed in the electronic musical instrument, the simultaneously      generated musical tones may be heard mixed to produce a tone mix effect. </PAR><PAR>  Although the above embodiments are directed to an electronic keyboard      instrument, this invention can be applied to other electronic musical      instruments such as an electronic string instrument and electronic wind      instrument by modifying the structure of play input detecting means for      detecting performance data. </PAR><PAR>  Although according to the second embodiment, three types of tone parameters      for the slave timbre can be variably set, the parameters are not limited      to three types; the parameters for the master timbre or both the master      and slave timbres may be variably set. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
