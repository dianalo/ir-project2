Thisrule sets forth: (1) Permit requirements, permit application procedures,and record keeping requirements applicable to the harvesting and importinginto the United States of Antarctic marine living resources by entitiessubject to United States jurisdiction; (2) vessel and gear identificationand gear disposal requirements applicable to vessels subject to UnitedStates jurisdiction that harvest Antarctic marine living resources; (3)communication and boarding equipment required to be carried by such vessels,communication procedures, and actions required to be taken by those onboard such vessels to facilitate the safe boarding and inspection of theirvessel and its gear, equipment, records, and harvested resources, and requirementsapplicable to the on board storage of Antarctic marine living resources;and (4) prohibitions and penalties applicable to the harvesting and importingof Antarctic marine living resources.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>effective date: </T2>March 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>address: </T2>A copy of the environmental assessment may be obtainedfrom the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, Room 9334, 1335 East-WestHighway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact: </T2>Robin Tuttle, International Science,Development and Polar Affairs Division, Office of International Affairs,NMFS, NOAA, Room 7240, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland20910 (301-427-2282).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information: </T2>Although implementation of the Actis a foreign affairs function exempt from the advance notice requirementsof the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, the Secretary decidedto provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the subject matterof this rule. As a result, this rule was published as a proposed rule inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 17, 1988 [53 FR 8784].No comments were received from the general public. The Department of Interior(DOI) inquired whether Antarctic marine living resources incidentally takenin the course of exploratory drilling or dredging by the United StatesGeological Survey would constitute harvesting or an associated activityrequiring a harvesting permit. DOI was informed that it would if duringthe drilling or dredging the resource is reduced to possession.Despite the fact that no public comments were received, the text of thefinal rule differs somewhat from that which was proposed. Review of theproposed rule indicated that while its substance was essentially sound,further editing and reorganization of the regulatory text was warrantedto make the rule easier to understand and less complex. Thus, additionaldefinitions were added, explanations and requirements only found in thevarious application and permit forms were incorporated directly into theregulatory text, and the procedure for amending permits was revised tomake it less complex and less burdensome. Relevant addresses were alsoupdated.The final rule amends the regulations implementing the Convention and theAct (50 CFR Part 380) to implement those portions of the Convention andAct not previously implemented and to give effect to the conservation andmanagement measures adopted by the Commission by imposing gear and vesselidentification, gear disposal, harvesting and importing permit, recordkeeping, and other requirements.In general, the rule requires vessels subject to United States jurisdictionthat harvest Antarctic marine living resources to obtain a harvesting permitfrom the NMFS unless the person conducting the harvesting has an individualpermit (defined in 50 CFR 380.2 as National Science Foundation permit oraward letter authorizing the harvest or a marine mammal or endangered speciespermit authorizing the harvest). Resources harvested under a United Statesissued permit (<T3>i.e., </T3>a harvest permit or an individual permit) are allowed entryinto the United States if accompanied by the permit or a copy thereof.Resources harvested by entities not subject to United States jurisdiction,and therefore not harvested pursuant to a United States issued permit,also are allowed entry into the United States if such harvesting will meetor met the requirements of the Act and did not or will not violate anyconservation measure in force with respect to the United States under theConvention or the Act or violate any of the Act's implementing regulations(50 CFR Part 380) including resource management measures contained therein.A NMFS issued import permit or copy thereof is required to accompany suchan import as proof that the foreign harvested resources met such requirements.In no event may a marine mammal be imported into the United States unlessauthorized and accompanied by an import permit issued under the MarineMammal Protection Act and/or the Endangered Species Act of 1973.Specifically, the final rule amends the definition subsection of the regulations,50 CFR 380.2, by adding definitions for the terms ``harvesting permit'',``import permit'', ``harvesting vessel certificate'', and ``import ticket''.The final rule adds nine new subsections to Part 380. New andSection; 380.3sets forth the relationship of the Convention, Act, and regulations toother treaties, conventions, laws, and regulations. Basically, the Convention,Act, and regulations are in addition to and do not supplant or preemptany other applicable treaties, conventions, laws, or regulations.New andSection; 380.4 requires every vessel subject to the jurisdiction ofthe United States which attempts to reduce or reduces any Antarctic marineliving resource to possession to have a harvesting permit authorizing theattempt or reduction, unless the attempt or reduction occurs during recreationalfishing or is covered by an individual permit.An application available upon request to the Assistant Administrator mustbe submitted for each vessel for which a harvesting permit is requestedat least 90 days before the date anticipated for the beginning of harvesting.The Assistant Administrator will issue a harvesting permit to a vesselupon determining that the harvesting described in the application willmeet the requirements of the Act and will not:(1) Decrease the size of any harvested population to levels below thosewhich ensure its stable recruitment;(2) Upset the ecological relationships between harvested, dependent, andrelated populations of Antarctic marine living resources and the restorationof depleted populations to levels that will ensure stable recruitment;(3) Cause changes or increase the risk of changes in the marine ecosystemwhich are not potentially reversible over two or three decades;(4) Violate established management measures established by the regulations;or(5) Violate any other conservation measures in force with respect to theUnited States under the Convention or the Act.Each harvesting vessel must either have on board an up-to-date copy ofits harvesting permit or an up-to-date harvesting vessel certificate. Aharvesting vessel certificate is a certificate available from the AssistantAdministrator to be filled out by the vessel operator with the informationcontained in the vessel's harvesting permit. The reason for allowing acertificate filled out by the vessel owner or operator to be carried onboard and displayed in lieu of the actual permit is to facilitate the remoteAntarctic fishery. While the information contained in the permit and inany permit amendments can be transmitted easily via radiotelephone or radiotelegraph,physical delivery of the original issued permit or permit amendment wouldbe often next to impossible. The information in the actual permit is whatthe operator of the vessel needs to know and what enforcement agents needto see.The owner or operator of a vessel which has been issued a harvesting permitis required to report to the Assistant Administrator any change in previouslysubmitted information other than a proposed change in the location, manner,or amount of harvesting within 15 days of the change. Based on such reportedinformation, the Assistant Administrator may revise the permit.Any changes in the location, manner, or amount of harvesting must be proposedto the Assistant Administrator and may not be undertaken unless authorizedby the Assistant Administrator through a permit revision or issuance ofa new permit. If a requested change in the location, manner, or amountof harvesting could significantly affect the status of any Antarctic marineliving resource, the Assistant Administrator will treat the requested changeas an application for a new permit.The Assistant Administrator may revise any permit to impose additionalconditions and restrictions on the harvesting vessel as necessary to achievethe purposes of the Convention or the Act. Further, a permit may be revised,suspended, or revoked if the harvesting vessel is involved in the commissionof any violation of its permit, the Act, or the implementing regulations.Section 380.5 allows any Antarctic marine living resource entry into theUnited States if its harvest is authorized by a United States issued permit(<T3>i.e.,</T3> an individual permit or a harvesting permit). The harvestingpermit, the harvesting vessel certificate, or the individual permit, ora copy of any thereof, must accompany the import. Resources harvested byentities not subject to United States jurisdiction and thus not harvestedunder a United States issued permit also are allowed entry into the UnitedStates if such harvesting met or will meet the requirements of the Actand did not or will not violate any conservation measure in force withrespect to the United States under the Convention or the Act or violateany of the Act's implementing regulations (50 CFR Part 380) including resourcemanagement measures contained therein. A NMFS issued import permit or copythereof is required to accompany such an import as proof that the foreignharvested resources met such requirements. Further, the importer is requiredto complete and return to the Assistant Administrator, no later than 10days after the date of the importation, an import ticket reporting theimportation. In no event may a marine mammal be imported into the UnitedStates unless authorized and accompanied by an import permit issued underthe Marine Mammal Protection Act and/or the Endangered Species Act of 1973.An application available upon request to the Assistant Administrator mustbe submitted for each import permit requested at least 30 days before theanticipated date of importation. Blank import tickets will be attachedto the permit. Additional blank import tickets are available from the AssistantAdministrator.The use of import tickets referencing a pre-issued import permit facilitatesexpeditious imports while allowing NMFS to monitor what is actually importedversus what is requested in the permit application.Any entity issued an import permit must report to the Assistant Administratorany changes in previously submitted information. Any changes that wouldnot result in a change in the importation authorized by the permit mustbe reported on the import ticket required to be submitted to the AssistantAdministrator no later than 10 days after the date of importation. Anychanges that would result in a change in the importation authorized bythe permit such as country of origin, type and quantity of the resourceto be imported, and Convention statistical subarea from which the resourcewas harvested, must be proposed to the Assistant Administrator and maynot be undertaken unless authorized by the Assistant Administrator by apermit revision or new permit.An import permit may be revised, suspended, or revoked based upon informationsubsequently reported or based upon a violation of the permit, the Act,or the regulations.If Antarctic marine living resources are imported into the United Statesunaccompanied by a permit or copy thereof authorizing their import, theimporter must either abandon the resources, waive claim to the resources,or place the resources into a bonded warehouse and while attempt to obtaina permit authorizing their import. If within 60 days of such resourcesbeing placed into a bonded warehouse the District Director of the UnitedStates Customs Service receives documentation that import of the resourcesinto the United States is authorized by a permit, the resources will beallowed entry. If documentation of a permit is not presented within 60days, the importer's claim to the resources will be deemed waived.New andSection; 380.6 establishes reporting and record keeping requirements.A logbook covering each day of fishing is required to be kept for eachvessel. Information required to be kept includes vessel particulars andfishing effort (date, vessel location, weather, master trawl or set number,gear type, set and haul information, and mesh size) and catch (species,trawl or set, tonnage, any marine mammals taken, and discards). The logbookmust be made available for inspection upon the request of an authorizedofficer and a copy of the book must, from time to time, be submitted tothe Assistant Administrator. A permit may impose additional record keepingand reporting requirements.Section 380.7 establishes vessel and gear identification requirements.Deployed fishing gear which is not physically and continuously attachedto a harvesting vessel must be clearly marked at the surface with a buoydisplaying the vessel identification of the harvesting vessel to whichthe gear belongs, a light visible for two miles at night in good visibility,and a radio buoy. Deployed longlines, strings of traps or pots, and gillnetsmust be marked with a buoy at each terminal end. Trawl codends passed fromone vessel to another are considered continuously attached gear and donot have to be marked.New andSection; 380.8 sets forth what equipment must be carried on boarda harvesting vessel and what owners, operators, and persons aboard a vesselmust do to facilitate enforcement of the Act, its implementing regulations,and applicable permits.Each harvesting vessel must be equipped with a VHF-FM radiotelephone stationlocated so that it may be operated from the wheelhouse. The vessel operatoris required to maintain a continuous listening watch on channel 16 (156.8mHz). Each vessel also must be equipped with a radiotelegraph station capableof communicating via 500 kHz radiotelegraphy and at least one working frequencybetween 405 kHz and 535 kHz, and a radiotelephone station capable of communicatingvia 2182 kHz radiotelephony. The vessel operator is required to monitorand be ready to communicate via 500 kHz radiotelegraph and 2182 kHz radiotelephoneeach day from 0800 GMT to 0830 GMT and 2000 to 2030 GMT, and in preparationfor boarding.Upon being approached by a Coast Guard vessel or aircraft or other vesselor aircraft with an authorized officer aboard, the operator of any harvestingvessel subject to United States jurisdiction must be alert for communicationsconveying enforcement instructions. The enforcement unit may communicateby channel 16 VHF-FM radiotelephone, 2182 kHz radiotelephone, 500 kHz radiotelegraph,message block from an aircraft, flashing light or flag signals from theInternational Code of Signals, hand signals, placard, loudhailer, or otherappropriate means. If the operator of a vessel does not understand a signalfrom an enforcement unit and is unable to obtain clarification by radiotelephoneor other means, the operator is required to consider the signal to be acommand to stop the vessel instantly.A vessel signaled for boarding must stop immediately and lay to or maneuverin such a way as to maintain the safety of the harvesting vessel and facilitateboarding by the authorized officer and the boarding party. Authorized enforcementofficers and boarding parties must be provided a safe pilot ladder securelyattached to the harvesting vessel.The owner and operator of each harvesting vessel must provide authorizedofficers access to all spaces where work is conducted or business papersand records are prepared or stored. Authorized officers must be providedall records and documents pertaining to the fishing activities of the vessel,including but not limited to production records, fishing logs, navigationlogs, transfer records, product receipts, cargo stowage plans or records,draft or displacement calculations, customs documents or records, and anaccurate hold plan reflecting the current structure of the vessel's storageand factory spaces.Non-resource items may not be stowed beneath nor covered by stored Antarcticmarine living resources, unless required to maintain the stability andsafety of the vessel. Non-resource items include, but are not limited to,portable conveyors, exhaust fans, ladders, nets, fuel bladders, extra binboards, or other movable non-resource items. These non-resource items maybe in a resource storage space when necessary for the safety of the vesselor crew or for the storage of the items. Lumber, bin boards, or other dunnagemay be used for shoring or bracing of product to ensure the safety of crewand to prevent shifting of cargo within the space. New andSection; 380.9 establishes gear disposal requirements. The operatorof a vessel may not dump over board, jettison or otherwise discard anyarticle or substance which may interfere with other fishing vessels orgear, or which may catch fish or cause damage to any marine resource, includingmarine mammals and birds, except in cases of emergency involving the safetyof the ship or crew, or as specifically authorized by communication fromthe appropriate Coast Guard commander or authorized officer. These articlesand substances include but are not limited to fishing gear, net scraps,bale straps, plastic bags, oil drums, petroleum containers, oil, toxicchemicals or any manmade items retrieved in a harvesting vessel's gear.Further, fishing gear may not be abandoned in Convention waters. New andSection; 380.10 makes it unlawful for any person to: (1) Reduce to possession or attempt to reduce to possession any Antaricticmarine living resources without a permit authorizing such activity;  (2) Import into the United States any Antarctic marine living resourceswithout a permit authorizing their importation;  (3) Engage in harvesting or other associated activities in violation ofthe provisions of the Convention or in violation of a conservation measurein force with respect to the United States under Article IX of the Convention; (4) Ship, transport, offer for sale, sell, purchase, import, export orhave custody, control or possession of, any Antarctic marine living resourcewhich he knows, or reasonably should have known, was harvested in violationof a conservation measure in force with respect to the United States underarticle IX of the Convention or in violation of any applicable regulation,without regard to the citizenship of the person that harvested, or vesselthat was used in the harvesting of, the Antarctic marine living resource; (5) Refuse to allow any authorized officer to board a vessel of the UnitedStates or vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States for thepurpose of conducting any search or inspection in connection with the enforcementof the Act or any regulation or permit issued under the Act;  (6) Resist a lawful arrest or detention for any act prohibited by the Actor any regulation or permit issued under the Act;  (7) Assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate or interfere with an authorizedofficer in the conduct of any boarding, inspection, or search in connectionwith the enforcement of the Act or any regulation or permit issued underthe Act;  (8) Interfere with, delay, or prevent by any means the apprehension, arrest,or detention of another person, with the knowledge that such other personhas committed any act prohibited by the Act or any regulation or permitissued under the Act;  (9) Use any vessel to engage in harvesting after the revocation, or duringthe period of suspension, of an applicable permit issued under the Act; (10) Fail to identify, falsely identify, fail to properly maintain, orobscure the identification of a harvesting vessel or its gear as requiredby the regulations;  (11) Falsify or fail to make, keep, maintain, or submit any record or reportrequired by the regulations;  (12) Fish in a closed area;  (13) Trawl with a mesh size in any part of the trawl net smaller than thatallowed for any directed fishing for Antarctic finfishes as specified inthe regulations;  (14) Use any means or device which would reduce the size or obstruct theopening of the trawl meshes specified in the regulations;  (15) Possess fish in violation of the catch limit specified in the regulations; (16) Discard netting or other substances in the Convention Area in violationof the regulations; or  (17) Violate or attempt to violate any provision of the Act or any regulationor permit issued under the Act.   New andSection; 380.11 warns that any person or harvesting vessel found tobe in violation of the Act or any regulations or permit issued under theAct will be subject to the civil and criminal penalty provisions and forfeitureprovisions prescribed in the Act, the regulations setting forth applicablecivil procedures (15 CFR Part 904), and other applicable laws.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Secretary of Commerce has determined that this rule is necessary toimplement the Act and the Convention and to give effect to the conservationand management measures adopted by the Commission and agreed to by theUnited States. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (Assistant Administrator)prepared an environmental assessment for this rule under Executive Order12114 and the Administrator concluded that there will be no significantimpact on the environment as a result of the rule.This action is exempt from Executive Order 12291 and section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act because it involves a foreign affairs functionof the United States. Because notice and comment rulemaking is not requiredfor this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply; therefore,a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. At present there areno vessels subject to United States jurisdiction harvesting Antarctic marineliving resources for commercial purposes within the area to which theseregulations apply. Presently, the only Antarctic resources being harvestedby vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the United States are those beingtaken as scientific specimens under National Science Foundation permitsor by the United States Antarctic Marine Living Resources directed researchprogram. Accordingly, these regulations should not have an incrementaleconomic impact on United States vessels harvesting or performing associatedactivities in the Convention area. Subsequent to these regulations being proposed, some Antarctic marine livingresources harvested by vessels not subject to United States jurisdictionhave been imported into the United States. However, the incremental economicimpact on importers of the import permit and reporting requirements establishedby these regulations will be minor. This rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to therequirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The collection of informationhas been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned OMBControl Number 0648-0194. This authorization expires February, 1991. The annual public reporting burden for this collection of information isestimated to average six hours per harvester and one and three-quarterhours per importer, including the time for reviewing instructions, searchingexisting data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection information. Send comments regarding thisburden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Robin Tuttle, InternationalScience, Development and Polar Affairs Division, Office of InternationalAffairs, NMFS, NOAA, Room 7240, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring,Maryland 20910, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 380 </ITAG>Antarctic, Fish and Wildlife.

(b) The Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2401 <T3>et seq.</T3>) implements the Antarctic Treaty Agreed Measures for theConservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (12 U.S.T. 794). The AntarcticConservation Act and its implementing regulations titled ``Conservationof Antarctic Animals and Plants'' (45 CFR Part 670) apply to certain definedactivities of United States citizens south of 60 anddegrees;S. latitude.(c) The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 701 <T3>et seq</T3>.), and their implementing regulations also apply to theharvesting and importation of Antarctic marine living resources. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 380.4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Harvesting permits. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General.</T3> (1) Every vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the UnitedStates which attempts to reduce or reduces any Antarctic marine livingresource to possession must have a harvesting permit authorizing the attemptor reduction, unless the attempt or reduction occurs during recreationalfishing or is covered by an individual permit. Boats launched from a vesselissued a harvesting permit do not require a separate permit but are coveredby the permit issued the launching vessel. Any enforcement action whichresults from the activities of a launched boat will be taken against thelaunching vessel. (2) Permits issued under this section do not authorize vessels or personssubject to the jurisdiction of the United States to harass, capture, harm,kill, harvest, or import marine mammals. No marine mammals may be takenin the course of commercial fishing operations unless the taking is allowedunder the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and/or the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) pursuant to an exemption or permit granted by the appropriateagency.

Blank certificatesare available from the Assistant Administrator.(h) <T3>Changes in information submitted by permit applicants or holders.</T3>(1) Changes in pending applications. Applicants for a harvesting permitmust report to the Assistant Administrator in writing any change in theinformation contained in the application. The processing period for theapplication will be extended as necessary to review the change.(2) Changes occurring after permit issuance.(i) Changes other than in the manner and amount of harvesting. The owneror operator of a vessel which has been issued a harvesting permit mustreport to the Assistant Administrator in writing any change in previouslysubmitted information other than a proposed change in the location, manner,or amount of harvesting within 15 days of the change. Based on such reportedinformation, the Assistant Administrator may revise the permit effectiveupon notification to the permit holder. As soon as possible, the vesselowner or operator must revise any harvesting vessel certificate evidencingthe permit, accordingly.(ii) Requested changes in the location, manner, or amount of harvesting.Any changes in the manner or amount of harvesting must be proposed in writingto the Assistant Administrator and may not be undertaken unless authorizedby the Assistant Administrator through a permit revision or issuance ofa new permit. If a requested change in the location, manner, or amountof harvesting could significantly affect the status of any Antarctic marineliving resource, the Assistant Administrator will treat the requested changeas an application for a new permit and so notify the holder.(i) <T3>Additional conditions and restrictions</T3>. The Assistant Administratormay revise the harvesting permit, effective upon notification to the permitholder, to impose additional conditions and restrictions on the harvestingvessel as necessary to achieve the purposes of the Convention or the Act.The permit holder must, as soon as possible, direct the vessel operatorto revise the harvesting vessel certificate, if any, accordingly.(j) <T3>Revision, suspension, or revocation for violations</T3>. A harvestingpermit may be revised, suspended, or revoked if the harvesting vessel isinvolved in the commission of any violation of its permit, the Act, orthis part. Failure to report a change in the information contained in anapplication within 15 days of the change is a violation of this part andvoids the application or permit, as applicable. If a change in vessel ownershipis not reported, the violation is chargeable to the previous owner. 15CFR Part 904 governs permit sanctions under this part.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 380.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Import permits.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General</T3>. (1) Any Antarctic marine living resource may be importedinto the United States if its harvest is authorized by an individual permitor a harvesting permit. The harvesting permit, the harvesting vessel certificate,or the individual permit, or a copy of any thereof, must accompany theimport. Resources harvested by entities not subject to United States jurisdictionand, thus, not harvested under a United States issued permit (<T3>i.e.,</T3> a harvesting permit or an individual permit), also may beimported into the United States if such harvesting will meet or met therequirements of the Act and will not or did not violate any conservationmeasure in force with respect to the United States under the Conventionor the Act or violate any of the regulations in this part including resourcemanagement measures contained therein. A NMFS issued import permit or copythereof must accompany such an import as proof that the foreign harvestedresources met such requirements. Further, the importer is required to completeand return to the Assistant Administrator, no later than 10 days afterthe date of the importation, an import ticket reporting the importation.However, in no event may a marine mammal be imported into the United Statesunless authorized and accompanied by an import permit issued under theMarine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and/or the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>).(2) A permit issued under this subsection does not authorize the harvestof any Antarctic marine living resources.(b) <T3>Application. </T3>Application forms for import permits are availablefrom the Assistant Administrator. A fully completed and accurate applicationmust be submitted for each import permit requested at least 30 days beforethe anticipated date of the importation.(c) <T3>Issuance. </T3>The Assistant Administrator may issue an import permitif the Assistant Administrator determines that the importation meets therequirements of the Act and that the resources were not or will not beharvested in violation of any conservation measure in force with respectto the United States or in violation of any regulation in this part. Blankimport tickets will be attached to the permit. Additional blank importtickets are available from the Assistant Administrator.(d) <T3>Duration. </T3>An import permit is valid from its date of issuanceto its date of expiration unless it is revoked or suspended.(e) <T3>Transfer. </T3>An import permit is not transferable or assignable.(f) <T3>Changes in information submitted by permit applicants or holders. </T3>(1)Changes in pending applications. Applicants for an import permit must reportin writing to the Assistant Administrator any change in the informationsubmitted in their import permit application. The processing period forthe application will be extended as necessary to review the change.(2) Changes occurring after permit issuance. Any entity issued an importpermit must report in writing to the Assistant Administrator any changesin previously submitted information. Any changes that would not resultin a change in the importation authorized by the permit must be reportedon the import ticket required to be submitted to the Assistant Administratorno later than 10 days after the date of importation. Any changes that wouldresult in a change in the importation authorized by the permit such ascountry of origin, type and quantity of the resource to be imported, andConvention statistical subarea from which the resource was harvested, mustbe proposed in writing to the Assistant Administrator and may not be undertakenunless authorized by the Assistant Administrator by a permit revision ornew permit.(g) <T3>Revision, suspension, or revocation. </T3>An import permit may be revised,suspended, or revoked based upon information subsequently reported, effectiveupon notification to the permit holder. An import permit may be revised,suspended, or revoked, based upon a violation of the permit, the Act, orthis part. Failure to report a change in the information contained in animport permit application is a violation of this part and voids the applicationor permit, as applicable. 15 CFR Part 904 governs permit sanctions underthis part.(h) <T3>Disposition of resources not accompanied by required documentation.</T3>(1) When Antarctic marine living resources are imported into the UnitedStates unaccompanied by a permit authorizing import, the importer musteither(i) Abandon the resources,(ii) Waive claim to the resources, or(iii) Place the resources into a bonded warehouse and attempt to obtaina permit authorizing their importation.(2) If within 60 days of such resources being placed into a bonded warehousethe District Director of the United States Customs Service receives documentationthat import of the resources into the United States is authorized by apermit, the resources will be allowed entry. If documentation of a permitis not presented within 60 days, the importer's claim to the resourceswill be deemed waived.(3) When resources are abandoned or claim to them waived, the resourceswill be delivered to the Administrator of the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration, or a designee, for storage or disposal as authorized bylaw.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 380.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Reporting and record keeping requirements.</ITAG>The operator of any vessel required to have a permit under this part must:(a) Accurately maintain on board the vessel a fishing logbook and all otherreports and records required by its permit; (b) Make such reports and records available for inspection upon the requestof an authorized officer; and(c) Within the time specified in the permit, submit a copy of such reportsand records to the Assistant Administrator.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 380.7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Vessel and gear identification.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Vessel identification. </T3>(1) The operator of each harvesting vesselassigned an IRCS must display that call sign amidships on both the portand starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull, so that it is visible froman enforcement vessel, and on an appropriate weather deck so that it isvisible from the air.(2) The operator of each harvesting vessel not assigned an IRCS, such asa small trawler associated with a mothership or one of a pair of trawlers,must display the IRCS of the associated vessel, followed by a numericalsuffix specific for the non-assigned vessel.(3) The vessel identification must be in a color in contrast to the backgroundand must be permanently affixed to the harvesting vessel in block romanalphabet letters and arabic numerals at least one meter in height for harvestingvessels over 20 meters in length, and at least one-half meter in heightfor all other harvesting vessels.(b) <T3>Navigational lights and shapes.</T3> Each harvesting vessel must displaythe lights and shapes prescribed by the International Regulations for PreventingCollisions at Sea, 1972 (TIAS 8587, and 1981 amendment TIAS 10672), forthe activity in which the harvesting vessel is engaged (as described at33 CFR Part 81).(c) <T3>Gear identification.</T3> (1) The operator of each harvesting vesselmust ensure that all deployed fishing gear which is not physically andcontinuously attached to a harvesting vessel is clearly marked at the surfacewith a buoy displaying the vessel identification of the harvesting vessel[see paragraph (a) of this section] to which the gear belongs, a lightvisible for two miles at night in good visibility, and a radio buoy.

Each operator must monitorand be ready to communicate via 500 kHz radiotelegraph and 2182 kHz radiotelephoneeach day from 0800 GMT to 0830 GMT and 2000 to 2030 GMT, and in preparationfor boarding.(3) Harvesting vessels that are not equipped with processing facilitiesand that deliver all catches to a processing vessel on the harvesting groundsare exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.(4) Harvesting vessels with no IRCS which do not catch fish and are usedas auxiliary vessels to handle codends, nets, equipment, or passengersfor a processing vessel are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.(5) The Assistant Administrator, with the agreement of the appropriateCoast Guard commander, may, upon request by the owner or operator, acceptalternatives to the communications equipment requirements of paragraphs(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section for certain harvesting vessels or typesof harvesting vessels provided they are adequate for communications needs.(c) <T3>Communications procedures. </T3>(1) Upon being approached by a CoastGuard vessel or aircraft or other vessel or aircraft with an authorizedofficer aboard, the operator of any harvesting vessel subject to the jurisdictionof the United States must be alert for communications conveying enforcementinstructions. The enforcement unit may communicate by channel 16 VHF-FMradiotelephone, 2182 kHz radiotelephone, 500 kHz radio telegraph, messageblock from an aircraft, flashing light or flag signals from the InternationalCode of Signals, hand signal, placard, loudhailer, or other appropriatemeans. The following signals extracted from the International Code of Signalsare among those which may be used. (i) ``AA, AA, AA, etc.'' which is the call for an unknown station. Thesignaled vessel should respond by identifying itself or by illuminatingthe vessel identification required by 380.6 of this part;(ii) ``RY-CY'' meaning ``You should proceed at slow speed, a boat is comingto you'';(iii) ``SQ3'' meaning ``You should stop or heave to; I am going to boardyou''; and (iv) ``L'' meaning ``You should stop your vessel instantly.''(2) The operator of, or any person aboard, a harvesting vessel who doesnot understand a signal from an enforcement unit and who is unable to obtainclarification by radiotelephone or other means must consider the signalto be a command to stop the vessel instantly.(d) <T3>Boarding equipment and procedures.</T3> The operator of a harvestingvessel signaled for boarding must:(1) Stop immediately and lay to or maneuver in such a way as to maintainthe safety of the harvesting vessel and facilitate boarding by the authorizedofficer and the boarding party;(2) Provide the authorized officer or boarding party a safe pilot ladder.The operator must ensure the pilot ladder is securely attached to the harvestingvessel and meets the construction requirements of Regulation 17, ChapterV of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (TIAS9700 and 1978 Protocol, TIAS 10009), or a substantially equivalent standardapproved by letter from the Assistant Administrator, with agreement ofthe Coast Guard. A summary of safe pilot ladder standards follows:(i) The ladder must be of a single length of not more than 9 meters (30feet), capable of reaching the water from the point of access to the harvestingvessel, accounting for all conditions of loading and trim of the harvestingvessel and for an adverse list of 15 degrees. Whenever the distance fromsea level to the point of access to the ship is more than 9 meters (30feet), access must be by means of an accommodation ladder or other safeand convenient means.
