Administration sources said announcement of such a movewould come this week.   The expected decision to renew Beijing's most-favored-nationstatus drew advance criticism from Democrats.   Republican lawmakers who met with Bush at the White House saidthe president left the clear impression he was ready to grant Chinathe extension.   ``He indicated he would present that while Congress is still insession this week,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.   Simpson and other GOP leaders said Bush made a strong case forextending most-favored-nation treatment, arguing that to withdrawpreferential trade status would severely damage the free-marketeconomy of Hong Kong.   Although he did not say exactly what he planned to do, Bushdemonstrated ``a tilt toward granting it. But he was seeking ourviews,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.   Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., said: ``He gave us theimpression he would do it.''   Bush was to meet with Democratic leaders on the subject onWednesday.   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said a decision on theissue would not be announced today.   ``As far as I know, no decison has been taken'' on whether tocontinue most-favored-nation trading status for China, he said.   The spokesman said Bush might bring up the topic at today'smeeting with congressional Republicans. It is unlikely the WhiteHouse would announce such a move before Bush conferred withcongressional leaders.   However, other officials, speaking on the condition ofanonymity, said the president was expected to notify Congressformally of the move before the end of the week.   In advance of a White House announcement, Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Michell, D-Maine, today strongly criticized renewal of tradebenefits to China.   ``Should we, by now giving the Chinese government what it wants,passively adopt the Chinese government's casual dismissal of ourconcerns?'' Mitchell said. ``I say we should not ... because it iscontrary to our principles, contrary to American interests andwrong.''   Mitchell said the Bush administration, by its actions, is``sowing the seeds of disaster with respect to the next generationof leaders in China.''   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he would withholdcomment on Bush's decision until one is actually announced. Foleysaid he understood there were conditions attached to the status,and he wanted to find out what those conditions are. ``I think it'sbetter to see what he recommends,'' he said.   Bush was planning to make the extension provisional, based onChina's human-rights performance over the coming months, said theofficials.   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., who accompanied Bush on the flight,said he did not expect Congress to react as negatively to the moveas it had last winter when Bush vetoed legislation extending thevisas of Chinese students.   ``It's not as emotional an issue,'' Wilson said. ``Most peoplein the nation don't even know what MFN is.''   Most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status guarantees China thesame treatment as this nation's best trading partners, includingthe lowest possible tariffs.   This benefit has provided preferential tariffs for about $12billion in Chinese products shipped to the United States each year,mostly textiles and toys.   Bush is required under law to act one way or another by June 3.But sources said he would rather deal with the issue now than waituntil the deadline, one day before the first anniversary of China'sbloody repression of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing'sTiananmen Square.   The president also would like to clear the boards of thedecision before the May 30-June 3 summit with Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev, the officials said.   Although Bush has recently voiced disappointment with China'sfailure to ease restrictions on dissidents, he considers deprivingChina of most-favored-nation status a drastic step that could havewidespread trade implications, the officials said.   Bush himself expressed reservations at a news conference lastweek about stripping China of the trade benefits, in part out offear it would harm the economy of Hong Kong.   Some $8.5 billion worth of China-made goods are re-exported tothe United States each year, passing through Hong Kong. Officialsof the enclave on the South coast of China claim revocation ofChina's most-favored-nation status would make these goods subjectto tariffs of up to 70 percent.   Some nations, including the Soviet Union, have been deniedmost-favored-nation treatment because of their restrictivehuman-rights policies.   Congress can block Bush's decision, but it seems unlikely itcould muster the two-third majorities needed to do so.   Bush, a former U.S. envoy to China, won a bruising veto battlewith Congress last winter on a bill that would have extended thevisas of Chinese students in the United States. Bush argued that hewas offering the Chinese students the same safe haven thoughadministrative actions.   Previously, the Bush administration waived restrictions on U.S.Export-Import Bank financing of business with China and grantedpermission for Chinese rockets to launch three U.S.-builtsatellites.</TEXT></DOC>
