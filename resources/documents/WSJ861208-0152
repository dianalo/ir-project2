Poindexter's argument (editorial page, Nov. 24) outlining the thinking that justified his &quot;prudent&quot; Iranian strategy gives a new meaning to the word. On the face of it, the policy he lays out is sensible, coherent and informed by the best interests we could want from one of our public servants. From the logical point of view the aims he identifies are unarguable. Unfortunately, the tightness of his logic makes the policy that much more dangerous.    It is dangerous precisely because the president cannot allow critical foreign-policy overtures to be created and implemented by a group that by nature and function operates in isolation from the institutions that are normally responsible for clarifying and implementing foreign policy as a whole. This policy was developed in a partial vacuum, and implemented in a full vacuum. When this happens we will more often than not suffer the embarrassment of looking like either liars or fools, and do serious damage to the national interest. The Iranian &quot;option&quot; was working at cross purposes with the direction of foreign policy over the past year to create a unified stance by Western democracies to inhibit terrorism.    To say this is not to say we can't have secret overtures, or take actions to keep our options open. What it does say is that these measures must be seen in the larger context of our national purposes, and continuously reexamined and adjusted as policies and events develop. This is not easy. It takes prudence. Given the kind of isolation Mr. Poindexter and his men appeared to operate in, this kind of thinking was not possible. Prudence is not determined by ends, but by means. What the admiral presents us with is nothing but a moderate masquerade for recklessness.    Michael Vollen   New York   ---   The reply to Adm. Poindexter's point that &quot;those who now question us owe the country an explanation of how they would have acted differently&quot; is quite simple. First, the president should have ensured that the chairmen of the Senate and the House intelligence-oversight committees were brought in on the Iranian talks, and second, no weapons should have been released to Iran while the arms embargo was a publicly announced policy. The rudimentary fact that democratic governments cannot expect to be able to carry out one policy in the public arena while pursuing a quite contrary one in secret, at least not for long, seems to have been lost on this administration.    Robert L. Dwelley   Freeport, Maine   ---   The Journal and its readers should be honored to learn of Adm. Poindexter's interest in our opinions of the Iranian &quot;initiative.&quot; Too bad he didn't &quot;need to know&quot; our comments 18 months ago.    Eric Shuster   Narbeth, Pa.</TEXT></DOC>
