The composite indicator rose 0.49 to 446.47 on 127.7 million shares. Buyers and sellers played to a near-standoff, as 989 of the 4,403 OTC stocks that were traded lost ground, while 936 gained. The Nasdaq 100 Index of large financial stocks was off 0.20 to 416.03, while the Nasdaq Financial Index gained 2.98 to 439.44.    MCI, buffeted lately by investor worries that the stock's price may not have much further to rise after gaining about 57% so far this year, recovered a bit, rising 1 3/8 to 37. More than 3.6 million shares changed hands.    Meanwhile, Microsoft fell 3 1/4 to 52 on about 2.3 million shares after the software maker forecast future microprocessor unit growth over the next 12 months of about 10%, and told analysts to expect slower earnings growth from the company than previously projected, Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said. The news wire said analysts consider the projection important because Microsoft provides basic software for all International Business Machines personal computers and for Compaq Computer machines, which dominate personal-computer sales.    IBM and Compaq on the Big Board, Apple Computer and several other personal computer-related stocks began falling sharply yesterday afternoon as word spread about the relatively soft market outlook from Microsoft.    On 1.9 million shares on the OTC market, Apple lost 1/2 to 38 3/4.    Ashton-Tate dropped 1/3/4 to 14 1/2 on volume of 968,500 shares. The Torrance, Calif., computer software maker reported a second-quarter loss of $19.8 million on revenue of $59.5 million. In the comparable year-earlier quarter, which ended July 31, 1988, Ashton-Tate earned $11.5 million, or 44 cents a share, on revenue of $71.9 million. The company also announced that its president and chief operating officer, Luther J. Nussbaum, resigned over &quot;differences in management philosophy.&quot;    Stratus Computer slid 5/8 to 29 1/2 despite reporting higher quarterly sales and earnings. The Marlboro, Mass., concern had second-quarter revenue of $83.3 million, up 32% from $62.9 million, and earnings of almost $9 million, a gain of 34%.    The news wasn't all bad from other technology stocks, either. Corporate Software jumped 1 1/4 to 12 in active trading after First Boston analyst Charles R. Wolf initiated coverage of the company with a &quot;buy&quot; recommendation, the Professional Investor Report said. Corporate Software recently reported second-quarter earnings of 16 cents a share, compared with 15 cents a share, a year earlier.    Cellular communications issue LIN Broadcasting jumped 2 3/8 to 111 7/8 on 1.7 million shares. In a letter to McCaw Cellular Communications, LIN reiterated its willingness to be acquired by McCaw for $127.50 a share. McCaw Cellular rose 1 3/4 to 37.    Duty Free International, which was priced in its May initial offering at $20.50 a share, rose 1 1/4 to 36. Shearson Lehman Hutton's retail-industry analyst, Stacy Ruchlamer, initiated coverage of the stock with a &quot;buy&quot; recommendation. Duty Free sells name-brand liquor, tobacco, perfume and luxury gifts free of import, sales and excise taxes to travelers leaving the U.S.    ProGroup tumbled 4 to 12 1/2 after a letter of intent to buy the company was terminated. The sports equipment and apparel concern said Australian Capital Equity had proposed acquiring it for $17.50 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
