<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-74-0162 </DOCNO><TEXT>Six patients with hepatic haemangioma were examined with a 1.5 tesla magneticresonance scanner before and immediately after bolus injection of 0.05mmol/kg gadolinium-DTPA. Eight to ten spinecho images (TR: 100 msec,TE: 20 msec, scanning time: 26 sec) were obtained through the regionof the haemangioma. In all cases, dense contrast enhancement of the lesionwas demonstrated. The enhancement spread in all directions from the lesionson subsequent delayed scans (high signal fill-in); a signal higher thanthat from surrounding hepatic parenchyma was present two minutes aftercontrast injection. Dynamic MRI is a promising method for the evaluationof hepatic haemangioma and it is more easily tolerated by patients thandynamic CT using iodinated contrast medium. (orig.)</TEXT></DOC>
