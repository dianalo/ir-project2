We are in the heart of Maine's wild-blueberry country -- thousands of acres of ground-hugging berry plants and wooded groves, etched with uncounted miles of sinuous dirt paths. We are looking for rustlers. Blueberry rustlers. The wily thieves who invade these fields in the dead of night, scoop up clusters of glistening fruit, then wend their way along the uncharted byways of Deblois, Cherryfield or Township 18, to the receiving docks of processors known for not asking too many questions.    &quot;It's a tremendous problem,&quot; says Sonny Worcester, president of Maine Freshpack Cooperative in Machias, Maine.    Amid the rock-strewn soils of Maine and Eastern Canada, the wild blueberry is a gift of nature -- &quot;blue gold,&quot; as one grower puts it. Once a source of sustenance for native American tribes, the berries have an intense flavor and favorable baking qualities that today attract some of the world's biggest food companies.    Down East processors flash-freeze the fresh berries and later dehydrate, can or otherwise ready them for makers of such things as muffins and cereals. Yogurt, jam and pie makers sometimes blend wild berries with blander, cultivated blueberries from Michigan, New Jersey, British Columbia and elsewhere.    Overseas berry devotees also have taken a fancy to the North American variety. European jam and juice makers combine the berries with more acidic strains from Scandinavia and Poland. Even Japanese food companies now stir wild blueberries into yogurt preparations. A master chef from Canada's Prince Edward Island will demonstrate muffin-making in Japan in November. The fruit's new-found cachet has led to a doubling of field prices -- the rate packers pay growers and, presumably, rustlers -- to about 46 cents a pound last year from 23 cents in 1985. This year, prices are expected to inch up still further, as unfavorable weather is cutting the harvest from last year's record of 52 million pounds.    These changes haven't been lost on certain quick-buck artists.    Hard-working, legally employed blueberry rakers can fill 80 to 100 24-pound boxes a day under good conditions, and earn $250 or so. But rustlers can make much more. Everett Ramsdell, field supervisor for Jasper Wyman andamp; Son, says he reckons a fast-moving thief, picking &quot;only the best stuff,&quot; can skim off enough in a good night's work to fetch $700 or more from processors who look the other way. Some bands of thieves are said to have infiltrated the barrens equipped with miners' helmets and walkie-talkies.    &quot;We don't get organized gangs, like in the Maine Deblois barrens,&quot; says Cole Bridges, whose fields stretch into New Brunswick, northeast of here. But amateurish weekend thieves pick the choicest 10% of a field and &quot;make a mess of the other 90%,&quot; creating losses far greater than their actual take.    Wyman spent $30,000 on security during last year's month-long blueberry season, according to Bob Phillips, president. Company patrols turned up half a dozen vehicles, creeping through the barrens in the middle of the night and loaded with berries. But the drivers had pat alibis: They had done their picking elsewhere and were just joy riding. Lacking hard evidence to the contrary -- blueberries have no identifying marks, after all -- the growers were unable to charge them with theft.    Now, the rules of the game have changed. Swayed by industry estimates that rustling skimmed a million pounds from last year's bumper harvest, the Maine Legislature in May rushed through an emergency bill, An Act to Discourage the Theft of Blueberries. Pickers now must be able to produce written authorization from the landowner; anyone lugging more than 25 pounds must have a permit to do so; and buyers must keep copies of that permit, including the trucker's name and the amount delivered.    &quot;We've created a paper trail back to the field,&quot; says Edward McLaughlin, executive director of the Maine Blueberry Commission.    Some industry executives take exception to the paper work. It's &quot;a burden of regulations,&quot; complains Amr Ismail, executive vice president of Maine Wild Blueberry Co. in nearby Machias. &quot;Some people are overreacting to the issue,&quot; says the former horticulture professor.    But some big growers -- like Wyman and Cherryfield Foods, which have sprawling tracts in the barrens -- pushed hard for the law. They hope the potential jail terms for berry rustlers, and fines of up to $1,000 per offense for processors who accept undocumented berries will deter would-be thieves and unscrupulous buyers. To underline their get-tough message, the two companies have commissioned a security squad. So it is that five security guards are huddled in Wyman's field headquarters, laying plans for the season's first all-night patrol. &quot;We are the guinea pigs&quot; for the untested law, declares Frank Fletcher, a 50-year-old former New Jersey policeman and now head blueberry guard. &quot;It's up to us to decide how it works,&quot; he says, sounding a bit like Charles Bronson.    Of the group, only Mr. Fletcher has arrest powers, and only he packs a handgun, strapped to his hip. The others are to note suspicious characters, question them cautiously and relay the information to headquarters -- but avoid volatile situations. &quot;I don't want to have to go knocking on widows' doors,&quot; Mr. Fletcher warns.    Industry executives and security personnel suspect most rustling is done by locals, not by the hundreds of migrant workers who pour in from Canada's maritime provinces and other parts of the U.S. Some Down East families view berrying in the barrens as a kind of birthright, like shooting deer or catching trout out of season, says one local woman.    Back out on the barrens, in the early hours of the morning, the temperature dips below 50 degrees and fog settles in, throwing the glare of the pickup's headlights back at us. Mr. Fletcher slows the truck to a crawl, reaches for a wide-bottomed mug on the dashboard and consults a sheaf of maps for a route to one of the &quot;potential pilferage areas&quot; he is supposed to keep an eye on.    A week into the season, there haven't been any arrests. But a few people toting modest quantities of berries have been stopped and lectured about the new law, Mr. McLaughlin of the Blueberry Commission says. Enforcement authorities will use &quot;no heavy-handedness&quot; with small-time violators, he says. &quot;We're not looking to put people in jail; we're looking to solve a problem.&quot;    Even so, Mr. Fletcher remains wary, following lessons learned as a Jersey cop on night patrol: Never set a pattern, never go the same way twice. And, if push comes to shove, don't do anything foolish. Says he, &quot;I don't want to become a statistic in a test case.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
