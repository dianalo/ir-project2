The authors present an algorithm which performsthis type of diagnosis for the system-level fault model. The time complexityof their algorithm is O(t/sup 3/ + vertical bar E vertical bar) wherevertical bar E vertical bar is the number of tests and t is the numberof allowed faults. When t is small relative to the total number of systemcomponents n, this is the tightest known time bound. Specifically, whent is o(n/sup 5/6/) this is the best bound. In this case, the authorsallow integer weights to be assigned to units to reflect their probabilityof failure.</TEXT></DOC>
