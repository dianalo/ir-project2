(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Oracle Corp.andM;ORACLE TOOLS FOR MS-DOS 5.1candM;Oracle provides a complete range of tools designed for buildingindustrial-strength applications.andP;  The rich tool set, which includes separatecomponents for all aspects of application design, is aimed at professionaldevelopers and not end users.andM;Unlike other front ends reviewed, Oracle's front end consists of separatecomponents, including PL/SQL, SQL*Forms, SQL*ReportWriter, SQL*TextRetrieval,SQL*Menu and a set of optional CASE tools.andM;To connect the Oracle front end to non-Oracle databases, Oracle providesSQL*Net, a communications facility that provides distributed processing anddistributed database capabilities.andM;SQL*Net allows users to connect applications over networks to databases suchas IBM's DB2 and SQL/DS, and DEC's RMS.andP;  No other PC LAN back-end products,such as Microsoft's SQL Server or Gupta's SQLBase, are supported at thistime.andM;Oracle's front-end tools and applications can run on a DOS or OS/2workstation.andM;Depending on what tools are loaded and whether a user or developer is usingthe tools, the memory requirements could range from 400K bytes to 4M bytes.andM;At the time of testing, Oracle Tools ran under Windows, but not as aWindows-specific program.andP;  A future version of the product will beWindows-specific.andM;Forms can be built with help from Oracle's SQL*Forms tool.andP;  SQL*Forms is acharacter-based, non-procedural tool for developing and maintainingforms-based database applications.andP;  With a combination of SQL*Forms andSQL*Menu, a developer can design a form as well as a set of menus withoutprogramming.andM;SQL*Forms provides a library of features, such as pop-up (character-based)windows with overlapping regions, predefined field attributes,perform-default operations and application debuggers.andP;  SQL*Forms alsoincludes an integrated text editor.andM;SQL*ReportWriter offers the developer complex functions, such as multicolumnmailing labels, form letters with word-wrapping capabilities, matrix reportsand complex multisection reports with control breaks.andM;Report creation is handled through a spreadsheet-style, parameter-drivenform.andM;While the report writer is comprehensive, it can be difficult to learn.andP;  Toassist in tackling the learning curve, SQL*ReportWriter includes an on-linehelp facility with more than 1,000 screens of context-sensitive help.andM;To graph data, Oracle provides Oracle Graphics as a separate product.andP;  Thereare more than 50 different types of charts including bar, line, pie andhigh-low-close charts.andP;  Each chart has more than 60 different parameters fordefining axis, scale and label formatting.andM;In addition to SQL statements in PL/SQL, Oracle's procedural language, Oracleprovides SQL*Plus, a fourth-generation tool for quering back-end databases aswell as reporting on the data.andP;  Users can enter and execute SQL statementsinteractively so that they can perform ad hoc queries and databaseadministration functions.andM;PL/SQL provides extensions to SQL.andP;  It supports SQL statements and variabledeclaration, with many variable types.andP;  The language also supports blockstructured programming and allows nesting of code blocks.andM;Oracle also supports the following High Level Application Programmer'sInterface (HLAPI): Ada, C, COBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal and PL/1.andP;  The Oracleprecompilers, or programs that convert SQL code into a format that the frontend can recognize, allows the developer to integrate SQL and Oracleapplications.andM;In addition to the core products mentioned above, Oracle offersSQL*TextRetrieval, which allows the developer to combine words, concepts andstructured data fields into a query.andP;  Full Boolean logic, wild cards, andSoundex (a retrieval method based on phonetics) functions are supported.andM;SQL*Menu allows the developer to design a menu interface to interact withOracle Forms or procedures.andM;Like other menu builders, SQL*Menu provides an efficient method of creatingand modifying menus so that no recoding is needed.andM;In addition to the above, Oracle offers a complete suite of CASE capabilitieswith the following optional tools: CASE*Dictionary, CASE*Designer andCASE*Generator for SQL*Forms.andM;Oracle provides an encyclopedia of documentation.andM;The full set, if all tools are purchased, includes some 35 manuals.andM;Oracle Tools is among the stronger development environments, offering justabout every tool a developer could ask for.andP;  While the tool set is complete,for some applications it may be overkill.andM;While cross-platform support for DB2 and other databases is helpful to some,Oracle's lack of support for Microsoft's SQL Server or Gupta's SQLBase mightbe a limiting factor for certain types of development.andM;Oracle Corp.andM;Redwood Shores, Calif.andP;
