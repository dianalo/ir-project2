Mr. Sick's suggestion that George Bush met in Paris withIranian officials in October 1980 to strike a deal to delaythe release of U.S. hostages rests on the supposed eyewitnesstestimony of Mr. Ben-Menashe, who says he saw Mr. Bush there.Mr. Hersh relied on Mr. Ben-Menashe as his source for hissensational claims that Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamirpersonally passed U.S. intelligence to Soviet officialYevgeni M. Primakov. Mr. Hersh also relies on Mr. Ben-Menashefor his claim that media mogul Robert Maxwell worked with theMossad, Israel's intelligence agency.</LP><TEXT>   Messrs. Sick and Hersh have portrayed Mr. Ben-Menashe as asenior intelligence officer involved in Israel's mostsensitive covert operations over the past two decades. Mr.Ben-Menashe has written and told others, among other things,that he was a commander of the Israeli raid to free hijackedairline passengers at Entebbe in 1976, that he planted ahoming device in the Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak justbefore the Israeli attack in 1981, that he personally ledanti-terrorist assassinations, and that he had declined anoffer to become head of the Mossad.   Mr. Ben-Menashe's actual history, as revealed by hismilitary file, is quite different. From 1977 through 1987,according to American and Israeli documents and interviewswith more than 50 of Mr. Ben-Menashe's colleagues, friendsand superiors, as well as U.S. law enforcement officials andhis ex-wife, Mr. Ben-Menashe was a low-level translator forthe Israeli Defense Forces.   Although he was denied a special security clearance in theearly 1980s because, according to his Israeli personnel file,he was deemed &quot;delusional,&quot; those around Mr. Ben-Menashe forthe most part considered him a harmless man who performedwell in a menial and badly paid job. Most of the material hehandled was mundane, but he had access to just enough insideinformation to coat his concoctions with convincing detail.   In his last years on the job, the London Times found lastmonth, Mr. Ben-Menashe attempted to insinuate himself intothe international arms business. He would take extendedunpaid personal leaves to make trips abroad, paid for by hismother -- trips so numerous that he was warned in 1987 thathe would be fired unless he mended his ways. He thenresigned.   Mr. Ben-Menashe was arrested in the U.S. in 1989 forconspiring to sell transport planes to Iran, but -- despitesurveillance tapes documenting his involvement in an illegalconspiracy -- was acquitted. During the trial and later, Mr.Ben-Menashe frequently resorted to the &quot;Mission Impossible&quot;defense: The fact that Israel denied that he was one of itstop agents was the best possible proof that he in fact wasone of Israel's top agents.   In 1990, after he convinced his jury, Mr. Ben-Menashebegan testing his story on reporters. He volunteered talesthat the U.S. had secretly shipped &quot;billions of dollars&quot; ofweapons to Iran. When Robert Gates was nominated as CIAdirector, Mr. Ben-Menashe surfaced to tell congressionalaides that he had met with Mr. Gates secretly in the U.S.,Chile and Israel to conspire to sell arms to Iraq. Andfinally, when asked by Gary Sick about the &quot;OctoberSurprise,&quot; Mr. Ben-Menashe not only claimed to know about it-- but told him that he was an eyewitness to a series ofmeetings in Paris between vice presidential candidate GeorgeBush and representatives of the Iranian government]   None of his claims checked out. As Newsweek's nationalsecurity correspondent John Barry said on CNN on Nov. 8, Mr.Ben-Menashe is &quot;a fabricator. I don't think myself he knowsthe difference between truth and fantasy. . . . {I}f you weretalking about the American civil war, he would tell you hewas the guy who planned Lee's campaign.&quot;   Mr. Ben-Menashe said that it was he who leaked theIran-contra story to the Beirut magazine Al-Shirra in fall1986. The editor of Al-Shirra says the tip came from anIranian cleric.   Mr. Ben-Menashe said that he was positive he saw Mr. Bushin that Paris hotel room on Oct. 19 or 20, 1980. Not only isthe evidence incontrovertible that Mr. Bush was in the U.S.campaigning at that time, but Newsweek found another hole inthe story -- Mr. Ben-Menashe insisted that he could bepositive about the Oct. 19-20 dates because it was the daybefore the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. In fact, Sukkot fell onSept. 25 that year.   Mr. Ben-Menashe told Newsweek that a former head of theKGB, Viktor Chebrikov, had agreed to write the forward to Mr.Ben-Menashe's autobiography. Tracked down by Newsweek, Mr.Chebrikov said he had never heard of Mr. Ben-Menashe.   This is the man that Seymour Hersh and Gary Sick chose tostake their credibility upon. Mr. Hersh was warned by severalreporters -- including myself -- that he was dealing with aproven fabricator. Peter Hounam, chief investigative reporterof the London Sunday Times and the man to whom MordechaiVanunu gave the first pictures and details of Israel'snuclear reactor at Dimona, offered to open all his personalfiles concerning Mr. Vanunu to Seymour Hersh. Those filesdiscredited Mr. Ben-Menashe's claim to have played a leadingrole in luring Mr. Vanunu back to Israel.   &quot;I questioned Mr. Ben-Menashe about everything he claimedto know about Vanunu. None of his information fitted with therecord. Indeed, most of what he said was palpably false.&quot; Onone critical allegation in particular, Mr. Hounam had asmoking gun. Mr. Ben-Menashe said that he had arranged in1980 for a photograph of Mr. Vanunu to be flown from Israelto London for publication. In fact, Mr. Hounam had taken thephoto himself.   On Nov. 12, with the reliability of Mr. Ben-Menashe underchallenge, Mr. Hersh released a six-page statement insistingthat he had &quot;documentation&quot; provided by a &quot;private detective&quot;to confirm his stories about the Vanunu affair. Five dayslater, the London Sunday Times revealed that the &quot;privatedetective&quot; was actually a well known British hoaxer, JoeFlynn, who admitted that he had deceived Mr. Hersh inexchange for money. &quot;I am a conman,&quot; Mr. Flynn told theTimes. Mr. Flynn took #1,290 from Mr. Hersh's Britishpublisher in return for his promise to deliver telephone logsfrom a Geneva hotel that would establish that Mr. Maxwell wasindeed a spy for the Mossad. He never delivered them, becauseno such phone logs existed.   Mr. Hounam is puzzled by Mr. Hersh's decision to rely soheavily on Mr. Ben-Menashe's word, and his refusal and thatof his publisher to acknowledge their errors. &quot;I alwaysbelieve that if journalists get things wrong, they shouldapologize. But when I offered to show Hersh the evidence thathe had been hoaxed, he was very reluctant to see it. It issurprising to me that Hersh has not issued an apology to theMaxwell family.&quot;   ---   Mr. Emerson's most recent book is &quot;Terrorist,&quot; publishedby Random House.</TEXT></DOC>
