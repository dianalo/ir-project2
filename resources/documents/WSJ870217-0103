News of federal agents' arrest last Thursday of Robert Freeman, Goldman Sachs' head of risk arbitrage trading, and Richard Wigton, Kidder Peabody's head of arbitrage and over-the-counter trading, startled many of the New York-based firms' big clients. But the shock didn't appear to disrupt their business dealings with Goldman and Kidder.    The two men were charged with insider trading, as was Timothy Tabor, until recently head of arbitrage at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and a former Kidder Peabody arbitrager. He was charged with trading on inside information while employed by Kidder Peabody.    Martin Siegel, a former Kidder Peabody mergers and acquisitions executive until joining Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. early last year, pleaded guilty Friday to insider trading while at Kidder Peabody. He agreed to pay the government more than $9 million in penalties.    In a traditional Wall Street form of &quot;damage control,&quot; Goldman Sachs partner and management committee member Robert Rubin addressed the firm's U.S. offices on its internal &quot;squawk box&quot; network Friday morning. His message was that the firm wasn't implicated by the insider-trading scandal, clients and Goldman officials said.    Officials close to Goldman said the firm also reiterated that, based on a study conducted last year by two law firms, it believes Mr. Freeman is innocent of the insider-trading charges. Goldman made the same assertion in a memorandum issued late Thursday, after the arrests. Goldman said Friday that it will pay Mr. Freeman's legal fees.    At Kidder Peabody, a unit of Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric Co., internal memos circulated to employees Friday repeated the firm's public pronouncements that it hasn't violated insider-trading laws, an employee said.    The affair is the second insider-trading scandal to touch Kidder in the past three years. In 1984, one of the firm's top brokers, Peter Brant, traded on inside information provided in 1983 and 1984 by R. Foster Winans, who at the time was a &quot;Heard on the Street&quot; writer for this newspaper. Mr. Brant pleaded guilty and awaits sentencing on three felony counts. Kidder Peabody wasn't implicated in the scandal.    The arrests at Kidder and Goldman, two of Wall Street's most prestigious houses, startled some institutional clients. &quot;I confess to being shocked,&quot; said Dave Williams, head of Alliance Capital Management Corp., a large New York money manager. &quot;These are two of the best-managed firms on Wall Street.&quot;    James Martin, head of the College Retirement Equities Fund, one of the largest U.S. institutional investors, said, &quot;One hates to think that people take advantage of inside information -- especially when it involves a stock we own.&quot; CREF, which has more than $25 billion in assets, at the time of the traders' alleged offenses owned shares in both Unocal Inc. and Storer Communications, the two stocks cited in last week's arrests.    &quot;If legal action seems appropriate&quot; to regain any money that CREF might have lost in relation to the investigation, &quot;we won't be shy about pressing a case,&quot; Mr. Martin added.    Nevertheless, CREF and many other institutional traders have sustained trading relationships with Goldman and Kidder for decades, and most voiced support for the firms. &quot;I don't think this will lead to any changes in who we trade with. It isn't going to affect how we do business,&quot; CREF's Mr. Martin said.    Stanley Seneker, vice president and treasurer of Ford Motor Co., one of Goldman's largest clients since the firm took Ford public in the mid-1950s, said, &quot;We have had and continue to have the highest respect&quot; for Goldman. &quot;These latest events will have no effect&quot; on Ford's relationship with the firm, he said.    Panhandle Eastern Corp., a Houston-based energy company, &quot;stands by Kidder,&quot; said treasurer Vernon Rigdon. The company has used Kidder for financial advice for at least 15 years, he said. &quot;It's a longtime, long-term relationship. It isn't going to be affected by this.&quot;    The affair left many clients wondering, however, who else the investigation might touch. A top executive of a big Goldman Sachs corporate finance client in the Midwest, who asked not to be identified, also said he has no plans to switch underwriters. But &quot;if this is the tip of the iceberg&quot; and the scandal spreads to other officials at Goldman and appears to undermine the firm's reputation, he said, he would sever the relationship.    CREF's Mr. Martin added: &quot;The uncertainty in terms of who might be next is a problem.&quot; He said, &quot;You'd like to know that the person you're dealing with on Wall Street is clean.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
