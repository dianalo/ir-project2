SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Academy of Sciences report said 12million Poles live in areas devastated by pollution and urgedtighter regulation to clean up what one scientist on Wednesdaycalled Europe's dirtiest country.   Most beaches on the Baltic Sea have been closed, industrial wasteoutput increased by nearly half in the past five years, and mostPolish rivers lack drinkable water, according to the study publishedin newspapers Wednesday.   Poland ranks second in Europe in sulfur dioxide emissions, saidthe report by the academy, the nation's most foremost researchinstitution.   ``There has been a complete breakdown of the state of naturalbalance in 27 areas'' inhabited by one-third of Poland's 38 millionpeople, the newspaper Zycie Warszawy said in its summary of thereport revealed during a Tuesday meeting of the academy's governingpresidium.   The newspapers summarized the findings of a report, ``A Judgmentof Effectiveness and Directions of Action in the Field of Shapingand Protecting the Environment,'' by the scientific committee ``Manand Environment'' at the academy.   The report assessed environmental protection policy over the last20 years and criticized legislation, current solutions and lack ofpublic awareness about the threat.   ``The analysis showed that actions currently being undertaken areinsufficient and have not restrained a permanent deterioration ofthe environment,'' said geology professor Stefan Kozlowski,secretary of the committee.   ``It is an extremely urgent matter. It is getting worse day byday. We are the dirtiest country in Europe,'' Kozlowski said in atelephone interview.   ``It should be called `Judgment of Ineffectiveness,' '' theofficial communist party daily Trybuna Ludu said of the report.   The report said economic losses stemming from environmentalproblems were also huge, amounting to 10 percent of the country'sannual national revenue.   An increase in disease resulted from the state of theenvironment, the report said. It quoted a study of the carcinogenicinfluence on living tissues of dusts in the air of the Silesiaregion in southern Poland where the mining and metallurgy industriesare concentrated.   ``Symptoms include cancerous processes or genetic deformations,''it said.   The communist government newspaper Rzeczpospolita suggestedincreased enforcement of environmental laws and other legal remediesshould be used to improve the environment.   ``One of the ways of acting is to pay more attention tolaw-abidingness in the sphere of the natural environment,'' it said.It also suggested passage of new laws, amendments and regulations.   Trybuna Ludu said fines for environmental violations were toosmall.   In recent weeks, government officials have been expressingincreasing concern about the environment, and the newly appointedgovernment of Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski has said thataddressing environmental problems will be a top priority.   In one of its first acts, the government permitted the closing ofa chromium-producing factory near Wroclaw, in Silesia, forenvironmental reasons.   There is a budding independent environmental movement, with atleast two groups of activists _ Freedom and Peace and the PolishEcological Party. Activists welcomed the report.   ``It's good that ecological losses are finally the subject ofpublic discussions. It's good that people are finally being madeaware of the situation. We've been saying that all the time,'' saidFreedom and Peace leader Jacek Czaputowicz.</TEXT></DOC>
