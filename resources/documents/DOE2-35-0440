The reader is reminded thatspace-environment disturbances are pseudo-cyclical in their characteristics,having about an 11-year period commensurate with the 11-year sunspotcycle. The advances in systems and research documented here will standSEL in good stead during the next several years, as disturbances reachtheir peak levels with sunspot maximum. However, there are many areasstill needing improvement, some of which are discussed in the report.</TEXT></DOC>
