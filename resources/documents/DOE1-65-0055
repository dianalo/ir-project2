The Crown corporation blamed prolonged dry weather on theprairies for a $20-million loss in the past fiscal year. Water levelsare the lowest they have been since 1941. Alone among exporting provinicialutilities, Manitoba Hydro said its sales outside the province declinedby almost 57%, about $47 million, in 1987-88 and that it was forced tobuy from other utilities to cut its losses. The low water levels on Manitoba'sthree major river systems also brought about a loss of almost $30 millionin 1986-87, forcing the utility to raise rates and dip into its financialreserves for support. Moreover, Manitoba Hydro is embroiled in a ratedispute with a number of business and consumer groups that want a 9.7%increase imposed a year ago rolled back. Rate increases in 1986 and 1987totalled 12.5% and a further 4.5% has been tacked on for 1988. A goodportion of those increases has been used to cover the costs of fluctuatinginterest on loans outstanding and to strengthen the utility's financialreserves.</TEXT></DOC>
