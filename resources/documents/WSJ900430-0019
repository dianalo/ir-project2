Xerox also asked the suppliers to cut their prices 10% by1991.</LP><TEXT>   The requests, which Xerox said were unrelated to itsrecord $254 million first-quarter loss, came as part of thecompany's continuing effort to boost efficiency in itsbusiness-equipment operation. Total costs and expenses inthat operation rose 3% in the first quarter from the yearbefore.   A Xerox spokesman said suppliers who don't comply won'tnecessarily face any consequences. &quot;It isn't a demand,&quot; hesaid. &quot;It's a request, a suggestion. Should a supplierdecline to agree with that suggestion, that wouldn't be adetermining factor in our relationship.&quot;   Xerox said it asked 350 suppliers world-wide -- mostlyproducers of parts for Xerox's business machines -- to reducetheir 1990 billings by an amount equivalent to 3% of their1989 billings. The spokesman said he had no estimate of thesaving Xerox expects from the move, of which it notifiedsuppliers about three weeks ago.</TEXT></DOC>
