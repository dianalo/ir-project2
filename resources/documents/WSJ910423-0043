Since mid-January, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hassoared nearly 17%. From record lows in mid-February, thedollar has climbed 22% against the mark and 9% against theyen. Both would seem to be compelling reasons for overseasinvestors to snap up U.S. stocks.</LP><TEXT>   But despite a trickle of buying in recent weeks, foreigninvestors have largely shunned the U.S. stock market, passingup Wall Street's powerful rally. And prospects for foreignersstepping up their purchases later this year are mixed, moneymanagers say.   On the back of the U.S. market rally and the strongerdollar, &quot;we've seen some venturing back into the U.S.market,&quot; says Terry Le Porin, a vice president in U.S. equitysales at Salomon Brothers Inc. in London. But he adds, &quot;itisn't a sea change.&quot;   To many portfolio managers abroad, U.S. stocks areovervalued and the outlook for American corporate profits ispoor. Many also remain skeptical that the U.S. economy isready to pull out of recession. What's more, they havealternatives.   Of the 20 stock markets tracked by Morgan Stanley CapitalInternational, 12 outperformed the U.S. market in the firstquarter. And while the surging dollar slashed most of thoseresults for Americans (who do their buying with dollars),foreigners, especially Europeans, didn't suffer much from thedollar's surge, if at all.   The U.S. stock market &quot;has been expensive for a long timeand remains so; the yield on the market is incredibly low inhistorical terms,&quot; says Tony Dye, investment director atPhillips andamp; Drew Fund Management Ltd. in London. &quot;It has beendriven more by fear than greed: fear of being in the markethas been replaced by fear of being out of the market.&quot;   Last year, foreigners sold a net $15.3 billion of U.S.stocks, the worst selloff on record, according to theSecurities Industry Association, a U.S. trade group.Preliminary 1991 data shows they unloaded another $800million in January.   Many overseas investors are waiting for clear evidencethat the U.S. has definitely pulled out of its recessionbefore buying U.S. stocks. American investors, by contrast,have been gobbling up U.S. stocks, confident that an economicrebound is just around the corner.   British broker James Capel andamp; Co. and Germany's DeutscheBank Capital Corp. both predict that the U.S. Federal Reservewill have to cut interest rates further to jump-start theeconomy. &quot;We do not believe that recovery is imminent andexpect that when it begins after mid-year, it will be fairlytenuously based and slow,&quot; James Capel recently wroteclients.   Similar sentiments prevail in Japan. &quot;Our estimates forthe U.S. economy is for a fairly mild -- that may be toostrong a word -- recovery,&quot; says Lawrence S. Prager,Tokyo-based chief strategist for Nikko Securities Co. From1991 to 1995, Nikko forecasts that inflation-adjusted U.S.growth will average 1.5% a year. That contrasts withestimates of 3.8% for Japan, 3.1% for Germany, 2.7% forFrance, 2.3% for Italy and 2% for Britain.   &quot;It's hard to make a case for Japanese money coming to theU.S. in much volume,&quot; says Mr. Prager.   A key to any foreign investor's decision is the dollar.But foreigners &quot;have been burned in the past; they've seenthe dollar strengthen, only to have it disappear a month ortwo later,&quot; says David Strongin, director of internationalfinance at the Securities Industry Association. &quot;They want tosee some evidence that there is some stability,&quot; he says.   Although the dollar has climbed sharply in recent weeks,many analysts remain skeptical that the U.S. currency willrise much further. Nobuaki Ohmura, executive vice presidentat the U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co., says: &quot;The majorityof people in Japan think the yen will be stronger against thedollar&quot; later this year.   Moreover, money managers point out that they can bet onthe dollar and still avoid U.S. stocks. Phillips andamp; Drew, forinstance, capitalized on the dollar's recent rise by puttingmoney into dollar-denominated bank deposits.   Still, the negative foreign sentiment toward U.S. stocksmay be softening. Foreigners dumped U.S. shares sounmercifully last year that 34 out of 61 Britishinstitutional money managers recently surveyed by OgilvyAdams andamp; Rinehart Ltd., a London-based financialcommunications firm, said they were now underweighted in U.S.stocks and likely to boost their U.S. holdings over the nextsix months.   Lombard Odier International Portfolio Management Ltd. inLondon has already increased its U.S. stock holdings.Lawrence W. Harris III, its chief strategist, likes thedollar and the scenario that the U.S. economy is bottomingout, even as many other economies slow. The firm has beenbuying building suppliers Lowe's Cos. and Home Depot Inc.;Continental Medical Systems Inc. and life insurer ConsecoInc., and two news-gathering companies, Gannett Co. and DowJones andamp; Co., publisher of this newspaper.   George Kuster, a portfolio manager at Gulf andamp; OccidentalInvestments S.A. in Geneva, moved back into U.S. stocks alittle over two weeks ago. &quot;The fears about recession areoverdone,&quot; he says. &quot;I think they are going to lower (U.S.)interest rates a little bit more, which will help the economyrecover and stocks go up.&quot;   Mr. Kuster owns Colgate-Palmolive Co., Walt Disney Co. andMerrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;I figure if everybody comes back to theU.S. market, then you must buy the brokers,&quot; he says.   Turmoil in the Soviet Union could also send foreigners,particularly Europeans, fleeing to U.S. markets as a haven.&quot;The single biggest cloud on the horizon is the decompositionof the Soviet Union,&quot; says Nicholas Bratt, managing directorand head of overseas investments for Scudder, Stevens andamp; ClarkInc. &quot;Stock markets aren't really focusing on that problem,because almost no publicly quoted companies have any directinvolvement with the Soviet Union.&quot;   For that and other reasons, Steven G. Einhorn, co-head ofinvestment research at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., believesforeigners will eventually help give a boost to U.S. stocks.&quot;Foreign investors are under-invested in U.S. equities; theywere massive liquidators last year,&quot; he says. &quot;The dollar issolid. Some of the glow is off Europe, and the Germanconsolidation is a bit bumpier than people thought. All ofthat encourages investment in the U.S.&quot;   Still, others are skeptical. Foreigners will buy U.S.stocks &quot;if you can make an argument, with the Dow {JonesIndustrial Average} at current levels, that you are in apowerful leg here and that you are looking at 4000,&quot; says Mr.Le Porin of Salomon Brothers. But he adds: &quot;How can you drawforeigners back into the U.S. when you think the top for theDow is 3000 or 3100?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
