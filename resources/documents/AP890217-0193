The enforcement campaigns have led to embarrassing scandals inFrance, Japan, Hong Kong, Mexico and elsewhere for crimes that rangefrom profiteering on inside information to bribery and embezzlement.   To many U.S. securities-law specialists, an intriguing commonthread among these crackdowns is their coincidental timing.   Some experts believe the highly publicized insider tradingscandal on Wall Street has jolted foreign governments intoscrutinizing sleazy practices in their own backyards.   ``I think what's been happening in the United States in the lastfive years has caused countries like France and Japan to beef upenforcement efforts in terms of securities regulation,'' saidWilliam Tyson, a legal studies professor at the University ofPennsylvania's Wharton business school.   Louis Loss, a Harvard Law School professor who has been consultedby foreign governments in drafting securities regulations, said manywere several decades behind the United States in anti-fraudenforcement and only now were grappling with the severity ofwhite-collar crime.   Part of the reason, Loss speculated, is ``they've read about thefinancial scandals in our country.''   He also said they're beginning to understand the necessity of atleast trying to show investors that their markets are fair, because``you're not going to play cards with me if I've got a marked deck.''   Others said the explosive worldwide expansion of the securitiesindustry over the past several years, coupled with quantum leaps incommunication technology that make cross-border trading easy, haveforced many governments to toughen previously lax anti-fraud laws.   ``We've seen more scandals because the markets are growing,''said Michael Mann, associate director for international affairs atthe Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division inWashington.   ``The bottom line is you can trade in any market now fromanywhere in the world and get your money to that market to close thedeal,'' he said.   To be sure, insider trading, manipulation and other shady marketpractices long deemed illegal in this country remain widespread inmany parts of the noncommunist world.   In Britain, stock prices of companies targeted for takeoversoften rise sharply at least one month before the official publicannouncements of deals, although insider trading has been illegalsince 1980.   In West Germany, where insider trading is not only tolerated buta term for insider doesn't exist in the language, stock pricesregularly rise in advance of improved earnings reports.   Switzerland, historically a haven for the profits of illegalfinancial dealings because of tough bank-secrecy laws, only madeinsider trading a crime last July.   In Hong Kong's freewheeling stock exchange, which many tradingprofessionals have likened to the Dodge City of internationalsecurities markets, conflicts of interest are said to be a way oflife.   It was the only exchange to shut down for completely for fourdays after the October 1987 crash. Eight market officials includingformer Chairman Ronald Li were arrested later on charges of takingbribes.   Things aren't much better in Mexico City, where earlier thismonth prosecutors arrested four top brokers and interrogated dozensmore in connection with widespread fraud allegations that range frominsider trading to sale of phony securities. Almost all of Mexico's24 registered brokerage houses have been implicated, and securitiesregulators have promised tough new rules.   Japan, home to the biggest stock market, modeled its postwar lawson securities fraud after those in the United States but rarelyenforced them. One reason, said Tyson, is ``the Japanese never feltinsider trading was wrong.''   A recent Japanese move to put teeth in its laws has since led toa massive stock-trading scandal that's jolted the country'sgoverning party and created a nationwide debate about businessethics.   The scandal involved the sale of thousands of shares of unlistedstock by the Recruit Co. to politicians and other prominent peopleat bargain prices. The buyers reaped windfalls when the shares werepublicly traded later.   Three Cabinet ministers and more than a dozen other senior-levelaides have resigned, and there has been speculation about theinvolvement of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.   An equally serious scandal has been dogging French PresidentFrancois Mitterrand's government because of an intensifiedsecurities-fraud enforcement campaign by the Commission desOperations de Bourse, France's market regulator.   The commission found evidence of blatant insider trading in thestock of the U.S. company Triangle Industries Inc. immediatelybefore it was taken over by Pechiney SA, a French metalmaker. Thoseimplicated included businessmen with close ties to Mitterrand.   It is unclear why the French commission seized upon the Triangletakeover as the launchpad for what has become daily front-page newsin France. But people familiar with the probe have said the Frenchwere tipped off by their American counterparts at the SEC, which hasbeen attempting to negotiate a cooperation agreement with France andseveral other countries for policing international market frauds.   To date, the SEC has only secured cooperation agreements withBritain, Japan, Switzerland, three Canadian provinces and Brazil.Many countries simply ignore SEC requests for help in tracking papertrails, and some have laws that ban foreigners from gaining accessto any financial records.   Mann declined to say whether the SEC played a role in theTriangle-Pechiney affair. But he said the need for internationalcooperation in securities law is one of the most sensitive problemsfaced by the enforcement agency.   ``From the SEC perspective, the focus is to try to work outarrangements with foreign countries that allow us to properlyenforce the U.S. securities laws without infringing on thesovereignty of those countries,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv Monday Feb. 20</NOTE></DOC>
