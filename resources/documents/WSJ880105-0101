The tax provision, which turns out to be yet another measure that was snuck into the budget reconciliation bill, prohibits the 168 U.S. firms remaining in South Africa from taking tax credits against taxes paid in that country. Sponsored by Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the measure effectively raises the firms' total tax burden to 72% from 57.5%. The nations in which investment is currently subject to double taxation include: Iran, Libya, North Korea, Albania, Syria and a handful of others. No Warsaw Pact country is on the list.    The measure wasn't brought up for debate on either floor of Congress. The House Ways and Means committee took only a single piece of testimony before it approved the measure last summer. What further debate would have brought out is that the provision will do more than cost thousands of blacks their jobs. It will also have the perverse effect of strengthening white economic dominance of South African society.    Sanctions backers say the hardship they inflict on nonwhites is justified because of massive popular support for such actions inside South Africa. But the private Institute of Race Relations in Johannesburg reports recent independent polls show the number of blacks who believe sanctions would end apartheid has declined from 57% to 41% since 1985. The number supporting sanctions even if they increased unemployment fell from 26% to 14% during the same period.    Much of the support for further sanctions appears to be driven by U.S. domestic political concerns. Whether or not blacks in South Africa support them has become irrelevant. Last month, nine members of Congress, led by Reps. Bill Gray and Howard Wolpe, charged that Ford Motor Co. had violated laws prohibiting most new U.S. investment in South Africa by transferring $61 million to Samcor, its former South African subsidiary. The members called the transfer, which was cleared by the Treasury Department, &quot;massive new financing for a rich and powerful South African firm.&quot; They failed to note that a quarter of the company is now owned by its largely black work force, which voted approval of the funds transfer in order to keep the struggling company afloat.    When Ford decided last year to divest itself of its 42% ownership of Samcor, it insisted that 24% of Samcor's stock be placed in an employee-owned trust fund while it sold the remaining 18% to a local company for a token payment of $1. As part of the deal, Ford agreed to transfer $61 million to Samcor to pay for needed new plant and equipment.    Elliott Hall, a Ford vice president, says that he told Reps. Gray and Wolpe about the transfer as long ago as last February and that both members also knew that Numsa, the nationwide union representing the 16,000 largely black workers who own a large chunk of the company, had approved of the transfer. Like the double-taxation measure, the attempt to paint Ford into a pro-apartheid corner after it already had transferred the funds reveals the cynical nature of much of the pro-sanctions campaign. </TEXT></DOC>
