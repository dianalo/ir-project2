Regulations implementing the FMP are at 50 CFR Part672. Section 672.20(a) of the regulations establishes an optimum yield(OY) range of 116,000-800,000 metric tons (mt) for all groundfish speciesin the Gulf of Alaska. The TAC(s) for target species and species groupsare specified annually within the OY range and apportioned among the regulatoryareas and districts.Section 672.24(b)(2) of current regulations restricts the hook-and-linecatch of sablefish in the Central Regulatory Area to 80 percent of theTAC. The 1989 TAC specified for sablefish in the Central Regulatory Areais 11,700 mt; the portion of the TAC allocated to hook-and-line gear inthis area is 9,360 mt. Under andSection; 672.24(b)(3)(ii), if the share ofthe sablefish TAC assigned to any type of gear for any area or districtis reached, further catches of sablefish must be treated as prohibitedspecies by persons using that type of gear for the remainder of the year.The directed hook-and-line fishery for sablefish began April 1, 1989. TheCentral Regulatory area was initially closed to directed fishing for sablefishon May 27 (54 FR 23662, June 2, 1989); retention of bycatch amounts ofsablefish was permitted. The Regional Director reports that vessels using hook-and-line gear havelanded 9,403 mt of sablefish through June 10 in the Central RegulatoryArea. Therefore, pursuant to andSection; 672.24(b)(3)(ii), the Secretaryis prohibiting further retention of sablefish caught with hook-and-linegear in the Central Regulatory Area effective 12:00 noon, ADT, June 29,1989. Any sablefish caught with hook-and-line gear after that date mustbe treated as prohibited species and discarded at sea.The Secretary has already forbidden retention of sablefish by vessels usingtrawl gear effective June 6, 1989 (54 FR 24712, June 9, 1989). Overharvestingof sablefish will result unless this notice takes effect promptly. Therefore,NOAA finds for good cause that prior opportunity for public comment onthis notice is contrary to the public interest and its effective date shouldnot be delayed.Public comments on the necessity for this action are invited for a periodof 15 days after filing with the Office of the Federal Register. Publiccomments on this notice of closure may be submitted to the Regional Directorat the address above until July 17, 1989. If written comments are receivedwhich oppose or protest this action, the Secretary will reconsider thenecessity of this action, and, as soon as practicable after that reconsideration,will publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a notice either of continued effectiveness ofthe adjustment, responding to comments received, or modifying or rescindingthe adjustment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>This action is taken under andSection;andSection; 672.22 and 672.24, and isin compliance with Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 672</ITAG>Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801, et seq.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 29, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">David S.
