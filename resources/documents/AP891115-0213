On a 296-122 vote, the House sent the measure to the Senate,which later adopted the measure on a voice vote. President Bush wasexpected to sign the bill.   The legislation provides money to keep federal programsfunctioning through Monday. Otherwise, their spending authoritywould have expired at the end of business Wednesday.   The stopgap measure is necessary because lawmakers have failedto finish the package of 13 annual spending bills for fiscal 1990,which began Oct. 1.   So far, five of the bills have been signed into law; two havebeen vetoed by Bush; four are on the president's desk awaiting hissignature, and Congress is working on two others.   ``At times it seems like we've been assigned the task of rollingrocks up a hill, only to have those rocks roll back,'' said Rep.Silvio Conte, R-Mass., ranking Republican on the HouseAppropriations Committee.   Congressional leaders hope to have finished work on all 13spending bills by Monday. If not, yet another stopgap measure willbe needed. Lawmakers hope to complete their work for the year byWednesday and adjourn until January.   The legislation is the third time in the last two months thatCongress has had to extend temporary spending authority. Lawmakerspassed one measure Sept. 28 providing stopgap funds through Oct.25, and a second on Oct. 25. That measure expired Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
