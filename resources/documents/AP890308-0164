After learning they had succeeded in driving Republican NationalChairman Lee Atwater from the school's board of trustees, thestudents focused their attention on other demands.   ``At the top of the list is assurances that there will be norepercussions,'' said student leader William Simms. ``We also wantto see Atwater's resignation accepted in writing, and assurances offinancial aid and better housing.''   Improved security and a graduate African studies program are alsoon the list of demands at the predominantly black campus.   Students took over the administration building Monday to protestAtwater's appointment to the board of trustees.   Howard President James Cheek has said the students' occupation ofthe administration building could stop faculty members fromreceiving their payroll checks, due Thursday. When the studentslearned the school planned to set up a temporary administrativeoffice in the school's liberal arts building, they staged a sit-injust inside the entrance.   However, after Simms met with Liberal Arts Dean Wendy Winters, hedirected the students to leave the site.   The group of 50 or so students then went on a nearby building andinterrupted classes, chanting and yelling, before regrouping andreturning to the administrative building.   ``We're trying to rally more support,'' Simms said. ``And we willcontinue to disrupt classes and this university until we can opensome lines of communication.''   Earlier Wednesday, District of Columbia delegate Walter Fauntroymet with the students in the administration building.   ``I came for two reasons,'' Fauntroy said. ``To get the detailson the students' demands and to find out what they want met beforeleaving the building.''</TEXT></DOC>
