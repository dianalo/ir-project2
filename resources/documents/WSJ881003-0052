Apcar (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BCY PET </IN><G> JUS IRS </G><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal bankruptcy judge approved a reorganization plan for Placid Oil Co., the Hunt brothers' flagship energy company, setting the stage for the company to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings in the next few weeks and bringing to an end a two-year struggle between the banks and the Hunts.    Judge Harold C. Abramson's order approves a jointly proposed reorganization plan that was supported by Placid and its 17 bank lenders. Over the next few weeks, lawyers for both the banks and the Hunts intend to complete final documents and schedule a closing at which Placid is expected to pay $663.5 million toward the retirement of $803.5 million in bank debt. The remaining $140 million will be paid off through a seven-year note secured by proceeds from energy producing properties.    The court approval last Friday is the second Hunt-related bankruptcy case to come to a close last month. Earlier, Judge Abramson approved a separate reorganization plan for the three brothers' trust estates, which own Placid. The trusts also were co-obligators on a $760 million loan to Penrod Drilling Co., which defaulted on the note in 1986 when oil prices fell. Placid defaulted on a separate loan that year, which led to Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings for both it and the three brothers' trusts while they worked out a plan to pay the debt. Penrod didn't enter bankruptcy proceedings.    Just as these two cases are ending, other Hunt bankruptcies are getting started. Last month, as previously reported, N. Bunker Hunt, his brother, W. Herbert Hunt, and their wives, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection. The filings were prompted by a jury finding in New York federal court last August that the two brothers are liable for more than $130 million in damages for conspiring to corner world silver markets in 1979-80.    Under the terms of Placid's previously reported settlement plan, cash for the $663.5 million payment will come from three sources: a new $240 million, 10-year loan from a group of Dutch banks for which Placid pledged its major operations in the Dutch North Sea, as well as a $223.5 million credit for payments Placid has already made to its banks since its bankruptcy filing. In addition, a total of $200 million will come from the sale of Placid's stake in the Black Lake natural gas field in Louisiana and the sale of its interest in its headquarters building here.    On top of that, Placid's lenders, led by NCNB Texas National Bank, a Dallas unit of NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C., would get 25% of the net cash receipts of Placid's North Sea operations for 10 years, secured by a second lien on the properties and a $3 million bank deposit. The banks also get a royalty stake in a Placid energy project in Louisiana.    Placid also agreed to settle a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service for $57.1 million, payable over seven years with interest. Most unsecured creditors are to be paid at least 55% of their claims this year with the remainder recovered over eight years, also with interest. </TEXT></DOC>
