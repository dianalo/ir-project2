Earl Martin, who has been missing for about a year, is wanted forquestioning in the probe of HUD's Washington field office, whichadministers federal housing programs in the District of Columbia andits Maryland and Virginia suburbs, The Sun in Baltimore reportedtoday.   Martin was a closing agent who represented HUD at settlement whenit sold houses in the District of Columbia. He worked for theWashington office at the same time as Maryland real estate agentMarilyn Louis Harrell, who allegedly embezzled $5.5 million as aclosing agent for the department in the Maryland suburbs.   Ms. Harrell, who has not been charged, has admitted taking thefunds and claimed she gave the money to charities. Because of thatinvestigators have nicknamed her ``Robin HUD.''   The Sun reported that neither Martin nor Harrell were bonded as aprecaution against theft or loss.   ``It's another example of incredible carelessness,'' thenewspaper quoted a senior HUD official as saying. ``The Washingtonoffice was in a state of total disarray.''   Meanwhile, the Washington Post reported today that HUD this weekwill begin a systematic review of property sales, demanding that 53field offices explain what happened to any unaccounted-for proceeds,according to a memo from Secretary Jack Kemp.   The Post said the content of the memo was disclosed by a seniorHUD official who estimated that as much as $100 million may beunaccounted for. The source based the estimate on the early findingsof audits of 11 field offices, the newspaper reported.   The Washington probe is one of several being conducted throughoutthe country. In Dallas, a closing agent has been indicted inconnection with the theft of $2.5 million in HUD funds. Probes alsoare underway in Denver, Los Angeles and New Orleans.   HUD officials were able to provide little information aboutMartin, The Sun reported. Motor vehicle records showed Martin livedin Potomac, Md. Neighbors said Martin ran into financial trouble andsold his house last year, the newspaper reported.   Ms. Harrell said Monday she was glad the embezzlement was finallydiscovered.   ``It really got out of hand,'' she said in an interview at herCamp Spring, Md., home. ``I'm not at all proud of it. I'm reallyglad it's out in the open. To carry this inside is so difficult. Whytry to say I didn't do it? I did it and I'm not proud of it at all.''   Ms. Harrell said she used the HUD money in the past four years tofund a variety of charities in Baltimore and suburban Washingtonthat serve the homeless, drug addicts, suicidal teens and theelderly.   ``I was just drawn into it,'' she said. ``HUD doesn't serve thepoor. There's no way they serve the poor. They dispossess the poorand I think that's unconscionable.''</TEXT></DOC>
