Gorbachev to China, setting the stage for thefirst Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.   The Foreign Ministry said in a statement today that ForeignMinister Qian Qichen proposed the visit in talks with his visitingSoviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, who ``accepted theinvitation and expressed his gratitude.''   Soviet Embassy spokesman Viatcheslav Duhin said Gorbachev's visitcould come as early as April. Senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaopingwill set the date when he meets with Shevardnadze on Saturday inShanghai, Duhin said.   Shevardnadze left for Shanghai today after meeting for nearly twohours with Premier Li Peng. The Soviet embassy said only that thesummit date and bilateral and international issues were discussed.   Gorbachev would be the first Soviet leader to visit China sinceNikita Khrushchev met Mao Tse-tung in Beijing in 1959. A year later,relations between the countries deteriorated over ideological andstrategic differences, and the Soviets halted technical and militaryaid to China.   Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit China in30 years, arrived Wednesday for a three-day trip to work out finaldetails for the summit.   Qian said during the talks that ``China and the Soviet Unionshould establish a new type of state relationship with each other''based on principles of equality and peaceful coexistence, accordingto the Foreign Ministry.   Qian ``stressed that China pursues an independent foreign policyof peace and that the normalization of the relations between Chinaand the Soviet Union should not prejudice their respective relationswith other countries,'' the ministry statement said.   China repeatedly has said it will never return to itsrelationship of the 1950s when the Soviet Union was new Communiststate's political mentor and main economic benefactor.   Beijing also has assured the United States and other Westernnations with which it enjoys increasingly important economic andstrategic ties that there is no possibility of a future Sino-Sovietalliance.   Earlier today, Shevardnadze canceled a tour of the ForbiddenPalace amid speculation he might meet Cambodian resistance leaderPrince Norodom Sihanouk, who now resides in the Chinese capital.   China long has insisted that Soviet financial backing forVietnam's 10-year occupation of Cambodia is the major obstacle tonormalizing Sino-Soviet relations.   Qian, in a banquet speech Thursday night, said the two sides hadreached a consensus ``on many aspects of the problem,'' includingthe need for Vietnam to pull out its troops and for some kind ofinternational supervision after Vietnamese troops leave.   China is the main backer for the three-party resistance coalitionbattling the Vietnamese in Cambodia. It supports the introduction ofan international peacekeeping force after Vietnam's departure, anidea Vietnam has rejected.   In his banquet speech, Shevardnadze called for joint ventures,cooperation in science and technology and the transformation of theSino-Soviet border into a region of ``peace, friendship andgood-neighborly cooperation.''   The two countries fought a short border war in 1969.   Economic and cultural contacts gradually have increased in the1980s, but normalization of political and party relations has beenstalled by the issues of Cambodia, the Soviet incursion intoAfghanistan and the highly militarized border.   Relations have improved rapidly in the past year following Sovietannouncements it is withdrawing from Afghanistan and reducing itstroop strength in Asia, and with progress in efforts to end theCambodian conflict.</TEXT></DOC>
