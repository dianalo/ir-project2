As recently as 1982, only 11 percentof U.S. motorists used safety belts, although in many foregin countries,belt use was over 70 percent. Since then, NHTSA and other groups have takenan unprecedented continuous program to increase occupant protection. TheSecretary of Transportation's 1984 rulemaking on automatic occupant protectionprovided a phase-in schedule for automatic crash protection (such as airbags and automatic belts) and encouraged passage of State laws to requiresafety belt use. In 1988, belt use was 46 percent, 31 States had belt laws(plus DC) and millions of air bags and automatic belts were in the marketplace.NHTSA's program objectives are to further reduce motor vehicle injuriesand fatalities by:andbullet; Increasing the number of belt users as high as possible;andbullet; Developing special efforts to reach groups that have a higherthan average risk of crash involvement;andbullet; Increasing public awareness of the importance of occupant protection,especially the benefits of new automatic protection systems such as airbags and automatic belts;andbullet; Measuring program effectiveness and sharing success stories toencourage even more public acceptance and use.NHTSA provides leadership and support to State governments who manage fundsallocated to them by Congress, and works with other private and publicgroups. NHTSA administers funds for State and community programs and researchand demonstration projects in order to assist key groups with highway safetyprograms and analysis of results. The Agency has 10 Regional Offices thatapprove State highway safety plans, and a central staff that administersthe research and demonstration projects. As a result of joint efforts withthe States and other groups, safety belt and child safety seat use is thehighest in history and public awareness of automatic crash protection hasincreased dramatically. Hundreds of community occupant protection programsget support and leadership from mayors' offices, health/medical professionals,police departments, civic and service organizations, and others.Since 1981, NHTSA has worked with opinion leaders, such as physicians,nurses, law enforcement officers, public officials, educators, employers,and civic groups, who can motivate people through interpersonal contacts.One of the most effective means for educating the public about the lifesavingbenefits of occupant protection has been through groups that have strongnational, State, and local affiliates (e.g., the American Academy of Pediatrics,the American Red Cross, and the National PTA). Implementation of statewideprograms, including education about the importance of occupant protectionin crash survival and support for enforcement of safety belt and childsafety seat belt use laws, relies heavily on the outreach efforts of organizationslike these. The process of sharing information and cooperating in educationalactivities and resources has aided the establishment of relationships atthe national, State, and local levels. Appendix A contains a listing ofthe national organizations that have been involved at various levels inthe occupant protection program.The area of child passenger safety has some unique considerations. Researchhas demonstrated that child safety seats, when correctly used, can reducefatalities among children less than 5 years of age by 71 percent. Thismakes child safety seats one of the single most effective automotive safetyinnovations ever developed. As a result of improvements in the convenienceof the seats, state child passenger protection laws and public education,the use of child safety seats has increased dramatically over the pastten years. A survey of 19 U.S. cities has shown the use rate rising fromonly 22 percent in 1982 to 84 percent in 1988.However, correct use of child safety seats is still the subject of majoreducational initiatives. Despite the apparent high rate of child safetyseat use, many of these seats are being misused. In part because of thisincorrect use, child safety seats are not currently saving as many livesas they could potentially save.NHTSA's program objectives are to gain further child injury/fatality reductionsby increasing overall use of child passenger protection systems, by increasingcorrect use of child safety seats and by enhancing enforcement of childpassenger safety laws.The results of the NHTSA Occupant Protection Program can be summarizedas follows:andbullet; Overall safety belt use has risen from 11 to 47 percent; childrenobserved in child safety seats has risen from 22 percent in 1982 to 84percent in 1988.andbullet; As of December 1988, 31 States and the District of Columbia havesafety belt use laws.andbullet; Belt use in States with laws averages 51 percent and in Stateswithout laws averages 33 percent.andbullet; From 1983 through 1988, an estimated projection of 15,238 liveswere saved by safety belts_9,700 due to belt laws.andbullet; All States and D.C. have child passenger safety laws.andbullet; By 1990, over one million air bag cars will have been produced,with millions more on the way.<ITAG tagnum="81">Current issues and concerns for the national program can be summarizedas follows:</ITAG>andbullet; Approximately 50 percent of U.S. motorists still do not wear beltsregularly. Several major national groups have set a goal of at least 70percent belt use by 1990.andbullet; New belt users may need reinforcement to keep wearing their belts.andbullet; An estimated 30 percent of child safety seats are not used ina manner that provides maximum protection.andbullet; Some belt users may overestimate the protection provided by airbags and stop using their safety belts.andbullet; Nineteen (19) States do not have belt use laws.andbullet; Crash statistics reveal that those individuals who are most likelyto be involved in serious crashes are those least likely to use safetybelts or child safety seats.andbullet; Potential for the greatest reduction in death and injury lieswith the current non-users (i.e. people living in rural areas, economicallydisadvantaged people, young people, etc.) because they are more likelyto be in crashes.FY 1989 ProgramIn support of NHTSA's mandate to save lives and reduce injuries from motorvehicle crashes, the National Occupant Protection Program works to fostera variety of partnerships with the private sector that will further thereach of occupant protection activities and programs. To this end, NHTSAintends to establish cooperative agreements in FY 1989 with nonprofit nationalorganizations and universities that have mechanisms to reach constituenciesthat can address the following priority areas:<ITAG tagnum="81">Rural Populations</ITAG>To achieve the agency's goal of educating all American consumers aboutthe benefits of using safety belts, child safety seats and automatic crashprotection systems, additional emphasis is being placed on reaching individualswho have been identified as being at higher than average risk of sufferingthe effects of non-belt use. Death rates of motor vehicle occupants aregreatest in counties with the lowest population density and lowest percapita income. Differences in road characteristics, travel speeds, typesof vehicles, safety belt use, and availability of emergency care are majorcontributors to this difference.The goal for this program area is to identify and develop innovative educationand outreach programs in organizations reaching rural populations and throughorganizations that have primary rural members. This would include identifyinghow the occupant protection issue can be made to fit into the organization'soverall mission and within existing delivery mechanisms. In addition, theAgency will be using a media placement service to increase awareness inrural communities through newspapers and radio stations.<ITAG tagnum="81">Economically Disadvantaged Populations</ITAG>Another segment of the population that has been identified by researchas being at higher than average risk of suffering the effects of non-beltuse is the economically disadvantaged. Income, education and other variablesare combined to form profiles called socio-economic status (SES). Surveyson belt use show that individuals who fall into lower SES profiles areless likely to buckle up than people with higher SES. Therefore, the agencyis seeking program delivery mechanisms to reach economically disadvantagedpopulations.Organizations must be able to develop programs and materials sensitiveto the various target groups within economically disadvantaged populations.Proposals should address delivery systems such as job training and literacyprograms, child care center outreach programs, and public health serviceclinics, and others.<ITAG tagnum="81">Child Passenger Safety</ITAG>Child passenger safety is important for the protection of children andto form good habits for life. The child safety use rate has increased substantiallyover the past several years. The Agency is concerned about reaching theremaining non-users. The potential effect of child safety seat use is diminishedwhen the child safety seats and safety belts are not used correctly. Estimatesshow that less than half of the lives which could potentially be savedby child restraints are actually being saved, due to misuse and lack ofuse. The correct use of child safety seats, especially now with the availabilityof automatic safety belts and air bags, presents additional educationalchallenges. The transition of toddlers and young children from safety seatsinto safety belts also presents complex public information and educationchallenges.There are many different types and brands of child safety seats. Also,there are a variety of safety restraint options for children as they outgrowsafety seats. State and local program officials and health/medical professionalsdepend on the Agency to provide support for access to technical informationand updates on current issues. The purpose of this program area is to workwith a national non-profit organization or university to further increasethe correct use of child safety seats through: public education, technicalsupport to health/medical professionals and highway safety program officials,and promotion of enforcement of child passenger safety laws.<ITAG tagnum="81">Occupational Health </ITAG>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, motor vehicle crashes arethe largest single cause of lost work time and on-the-job fatalities forU.S. businesses. It is estimated that motor vehicle crashes cost U.S. businessesabout $42 billion in 1987. Today, progressive companies have made promotionof health and wellness in the work place a priority for reducing costsand improving worker productivity. Many companies educate employers aboutimparied driving and NHTSA wants to assist more companies to develop programsfor their employees on occupant protection and impaired driving. In recent years, there have been several training programs sponsored atthe national level and by States for worksite safety officials promotingthe benefits of corporate/employer anti-drunk driving programs, safetybelt programs, including education for employees, use requirements, andincentive programs for employees who buckle up. NHTSA's program is currentlyworking with the Worker's Institute for Safety and Health, a non-memberlabor organization, to reach labor organizations and their members withinformation about occupant protection programs. The new work to be accomplished in this program area is to develop a cooperativeagreement with a national organization representing occupational healthprofessionals in order to increase belt use among its members and the employeesthey serve and to reduce the occurrence of impaired driving. Organizationsmust be able to stimulate employers' interest in promoting effective occupantprotection programs that include correct use of safety belts, child safetyseats, and automatic crash protection systems, and in promoting anti-drunkdriving programs as a health and wellness issue at worksites. Please note that this priority area includes an emphasis on impaired-drunkdriving awareness programs in addition to occupant protection. <ITAG tagnum="84">Objectives </ITAG>In FY 1989, NHTSA intends to award cooperative agreements in each of theabove described program areas. An applicant could be awarded cooperativeagreements in two program areas, if qualified in both. More than one agreementcould be awarded in an area if additional funding becomes available. Under the cooperative agreement program, participating organizations shouldadvance the concepts of safety belt use, child safety seat use and understandingthe benefits of automatic crash protection. In addition, organizationsshould work to stimulate the adoption of occupant protection use amongtheir members and/or constituents. Specific objectives for the cooperativeagreement program are as follows: 1. To stimulate the development of occupant protection programs and thesupport for safety belt and child safety seats use laws by: providing supportfor nationally coordinated efforts to develop and implement occupant protectionprograms; motivating the members of national organizations and the individualsthey serve to adopt traffic safety behaviors as components of healthy lifestyles;and enhancing organizations' support for State safety belt use laws andchild passenger safety laws and the enforcement of those laws. 2. To expand the outreach of occupant protection education activity andto improve knowledge of the effectiveness of such programs by: Stimulatingthe development of programs and activities for target populations mostat risk of crash injury; stimulating the development of programs designedto meet the special needs of an organization's members; increasing thenumber, improving the quality, and expanding the scope of occupant protectionprograms conducted by national organizations; and conducting an assessmentof the project's outcomes during the period of support. Anticipated outcomes of the Cooperative Agreement Program are an increasein the number, kind, and quality of occupant protection programs initiatedand supported by national organizations and universities especially forthose populations most at risk of crash injury. <ITAG tagnum="84">Eligibility Requirements </ITAG>In order to be eligible to participate in this cooperative agreement, anorganization must meet the following requirements: andbullet; Be a private nonprofit organization. andbullet; Be a university with experience in highway traffic safety programming.andbullet; Be a university with experience in programs for the identifiedtarget groups.If the applicant is a national, private nonprofit organization, it musthave a national membership, State/local chapters, and/or affiliates; demonstratean understanding of the current and potential role of the membership inoccupant protection efforts at the local or community level; have in placea variety of communication mechanisms that are appropriate for motivatingmembers and other constituents to become involved in occupant protectionat the State and local levels; and demonstrate top level support withinthe organization for the project and, where appropriate, demonstrate similarsupport from the membership. Activities undertaken by each organization will depend on the goals ofthe organization, its programming and communication mechanisms, and thepotential its membership has for promoting health and wellness. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Office of OccupantProtection (OOP) will be involved in all activities undertaken as partof the cooperative agreement program and will: andbullet; Provide a project officer to participate in the planning and managementof the cooperative agreement and to coordinate activities between the organizationand OOP; andbullet; Make available information and technical assistance from governmentsources, within resources available and as determined appropriate by theproject officer; andbullet; Provide liaison with other government and private agencies asappropriate; and andbullet; Stimulate the exchange of ideas and information among cooperativeagreement recipients through periodic meetings. <ITAG tagnum="84">Innovative Approaches </ITAG>Applicants are encouraged to develop <T3>innovative</T3> approaches in their proposals within the specifiedpriority areas that are appropriate for their constituencies. Some examplesof activities follow that have been conducted in the past by national organizationsand others involved in the occupant protection program are only providedto stimulate thinking and should not be viewed as required activities:identify members of the organization (and their family memers) that qualifyfor ``Saved By The Belt Club'' recognition and publicize these survivorstories in organization publications; identify and develop materials neededto conduct program (this could include handbooks, manuals, brochures, posters,audio-visuals, etc.); write and have articles placed in the organization'snewsletter, magazine, and/or journal; encourage and assist organizationsin adopting a national policy resolution for safety belt and child safetyseat use. <ITAG tagnum="84">Evaluation Criteria and Review Process </ITAG>Proposals must demonstrate that the applicant meets all eligibility requirementslisted. Proposals will be evaluated based upon the following factors whichare listed in descending order of importance: 1. What the organization proposes to accomplish and the potential of theproposed project to make a significant contribution to national effortsto achieve increased safety belt use, child safety seat use, and awarenessof automatic crash protection systems. Innovative approaches to accomplishthe project are encouraged. 2. The extent to which the project addresses the need of target populations,the priority issues, and the appropriateness of the project for the identifiedconstituency. 3. The overall track record, capability, and commitment of the universityor national organization to work with <T3>other</T3> national organizations that have related missions and thatcould serve as adjunct program delivery channels with assistance from thecooperative agreement recipient. 4. The soundness and feasibility of the proposed approach or workplan,including the evaluation plan to assess program outcomes. 5. How the organization will provide the administrative capability andstaff expertise required to successfully complete the proposed project.6. The proposed coordination with and use of other available organizationalresources, including other sources of financial support. The ``cost/benefit''potential of the proposed project will be considered. Upon receipt of applications by the Agency, they will be screened to assurethat all eligibility requirements have been met. Applications will be reviewedby NHTSA staff using the criteria outlined above. The results of this reviewwill be recommendations to Agency management for 1989 cooperative agreementawards. The Agency intends to make awards by June 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Support, Terms, and Conditions </ITAG>Contingent on the availability of funds, satisfactory performance, andcontinued demonstrated need, cooperative agreements may be awarded forproject periods of up to three (3) years. The application for the initialfunding period (12 months) should address what is proposed and can be accomplishedduring that initial period. To obtain funding after the initial 12-monthperiod, a continuation application and approval will be required for anysubsequent year. Continuation applications will not be subjected to competitivereview, but must demonstrate that the continuation effort will effectivelyand efficiently fulfill program objectives. Anticipated funding levels for FY 1989 will be from $60K to $80K per yearfor each of the 4 priority program categories. Subsequent years may befunded pending the availability funds, demonstrated program need and satisfactoryperformance. It is possible for one application to include more than oneprogram category, but the same evaluation criteria will be applied to eachcategory applied for. Federal funds should be viewed as seed money to assist organizations inthe development of traffic safety initiatives. Monies allocated for cooperativeagreements are not intended to cover all of the costs that will be incurredin the process of completing the projects. Applicants should demonstratea commitment of financial or in-kind resources to the support of proposedprojects. Organizations participating in the cooperative agreement program may useawarded funds to support salaries of individuals assigned to the project,the development or purchase of direct program materials, direct program-relatedactivities, or for travel related to the cooperative agreement. All award recipients will be required to submit quarterly progress reportsin a format and on a schedule to be determined after the award. In addition,recipients will be required to submit a detailed final summary report describingthe project and its outcomes no later than 90 days after termination ofthe period of support. <ITAG tagnum="84">Application Procedure </ITAG>1.
