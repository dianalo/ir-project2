Edelman, the New York investor, is offering to buy all of the shares of Telex Corp. he doesn't already own for $65 each, or about $870 million.    Mr. Edelman made the bid in a tender offer advertisement that appears in today's Wall Street Journal. In an interview yesterday afternoon, Mr. Edelman said that a group he leads already owns 8.1% of the Tulsa, Okla.-based maker of telecommunications gear and telephone systems.    The bid for Telex marks Mr. Edelman's second unsolicited bid for a company in a month. As previously reported, Mr. Edelman last month proposed to buy the shares of Rexham Corp. he doesn't already own for $53 a share, or about $185 million.    Rexham, a Charlotte, N.C.-based maker of packaging and packaging machinery, has said only that it is &quot;continuing to explore our other alternatives.&quot;    Mr. Edelman said he targeted Telex because &quot;we think it's a superb business combination with Datapoint and Intelogic.&quot;    Mr. Edelman is chairman of Datapoint Corp., a computer and communications product maker, and Intelogic, a computer maintenance company, both based in San Antonio, Texas. He is making the bid for Telex through a corporation that is composed largely of subsidiaries of Datapoint and Intelogic.    Market rumors about a possible investment in Telex by Mr. Edelman have abounded for more than two weeks, and Telex shares have risen in recent days. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Telex shares closed at $61, up $2.    Mr. Edelman said that he has retained Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. as his financial adviser and that any acquisition of Telex will be financed with a $600 million short-term &quot;bridge&quot; loan and possible bank loans. He said he hasn't yet secured the bank loans, but he has talked to banks.    Mr. Edelman said he began buying the 1,188,000 Telex shares he has accumulated in early September. His offer is conditioned on the group being able to obtain sufficient financing. The tender offer expires at midnight Nov. 6.    A source familiar with Mr. Edelman's bid for Telex said that the investor hasn't had any discussions with Telex officials about acquiring the company. But Mr. Edelman did attempt to phone Telex to inform them of his plan to make a tender offer for the rest of the company's 14.6 million shares outstanding. His calls weren't returned, the source said. A Telex spokeswoman said the company would respond to the offer sometime today.    Mr. Edelman declined to say what impact, if any, the bid for Telex would have on his earlier proposal to buy Rexham. But a source said Mr. Edelman hasn't given up on Rexham.    Telex recently has been stung by pricing pressures in its core computer-terminal markets and by new-product problems. The company last month slashed its earnings projection for the second quarter ended Sept. 30 to about $14.6 million, or $1 a share, from about $21.9 million, or $1.50 a share.    In the year-earlier quarter, Telex had net income of $19.4 million, or $1.32 a share, on revenue of $204.9 million. For the fiscal year ended March 31, the company reported net income of $77.2 million, or $5.24 a share, on revenue of $840.7 million. Net income for the year included an extraordinary charge of $619,000 related to the refinancing of debt.    Last July, Telex told analysts it incurred higher-than-anticipated start-up costs and marketing problems associated with its new products -- a line of computer terminals for International Business Machines Corp. midrange computers and a new line of products that mix computers and telecommunications.    Telex shares have fluctuated greatly in the past year, hitting a high of $101.50 but then dropping into the 40s after the second-quarter earnings projection was reduced.    &quot;Given the roller coaster shareholders have been through with this stock, I suspect they'll be interested in this offer,&quot; said Jim Poyner, a technology analyst with Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. in Dallas.    Datapoint has had losses in the past few years caused, in part, by a lack of product competitiveness. But the company has begun to turn a profit in recent quarters. For the fiscal year ended Aug. 1, Datapoint reported a net loss of $57.8 million on revenue of $312.1 million. The fiscal year loss included an extraordinary credit of $716,000 from tax-loss carry-forwards.    Mr. Edelman's far-flung takeover attempts have met with mixed results. Burlington Industries Inc. fended off a hostile bid by Mr. Edelman and Montreal-based Dominion Textile Inc. by agreeing last May to be acquired by a Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.-backed group for $2.07 billion. In January, a group he led prevailed in an unsolicited $235 million bid for Ponderosa Inc., a Dayton, Ohio, restaurant concern. </TEXT></DOC>
