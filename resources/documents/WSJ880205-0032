By turning down President Reagan's Contra initiative, lawmakers have taken responsibility for assuring that Nicaragua's Sandinista government is living up to its commitments to open up a democratic process at home and to pursue peace with its neighbors. If it fails, the White House, in an election year, will be quick to point out that it was the Democratic-controlled Congress that refused to approve Mr. Reagan's $36.2 million aid package -- which included $3.6 million for weapons and ammunition -- and &quot;lost&quot; Nicaragua.    As a result, the House's rejection doesn't mean that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega can ignore the peace process. If he backs away from the recent concessions he has made to political opponents, embarrassed Democrats are likely to trample each other in their rush to approve more aid for the rebels.    Mr. Reagan and the Contras got a symbolic victory last night when the Senate, which has always been more receptive than the House to requests for Contra aid, voted 51-48 to approve the president's package. The action has little practical effect, because of the House's rejection the night before.    The House's rejection of the aid package was only &quot;the end of a chapter,&quot; Rep. Tony Coelho (D., Calif.), the House majority whip, said before Wednesday's vote. &quot;Tomorrow we'll start another chapter. We'll have 10 votes on Contra aid this year. This thing's not over with yet.&quot;    What appears to be over, at least for the time being, is Mr. Reagan's control over the foreign policy issue he has advocated longer and with more passion than any other. His defeat this week, though by just an eight-vote margin, is another signal to nervous allies that Washington's leadership is severely weakened.    In part, Mr. Reagan created his own problem with do-or-die rhetoric. In a speech earlier this week, for example, he warned that rejection of his request meant &quot;up or down for Central America . . . win or lose for peace and security.&quot;    Yesterday, taking a more passive, conciliatory tone, the president said that despite &quot;a fundamental difference of opinion&quot; with lawmakers, he would consult with congressional leaders about what the U.S. should do next in its policy toward Central America. Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, added that Congress disagreed with using military pressure to prod the Sandinistas, and now Congress's approach &quot;will be tested.&quot;    Congress is likely to take a hands-off approach as long as the peace process progresses, and it isn't clear what actions by Mr. Ortega would provoke lawmakers to take a more militant stance. Rep. James Wright (D., Texas), the House speaker, said military aid for the Contras might be approved if Nicaragua &quot;were to misbehave in extreme ways, renege outright on its commitments or invade its neighbors.&quot;    But rather than taking such extreme steps, it is more likely that Managua simply will stall in the peace negotiations and try to slow the process of democratization. In their first direct cease-fire talks with the Contras last week, for instance, the Sandinistas insisted that the sessions be confined to technical cease-fire issues; the Contras pushed for broader discussions of political issues. The talks are scheduled to resume next week in Guatemala, and analysts expect that Managua will stick to its position.    &quot;It's not clear that the Sandinistas will have to budge,&quot; said Susan Purcell, director of the Latin American Project at the Council on Foreign Relations, a private New York-based organization that studies international affairs. &quot;But it is clear that the Contras will have to budge&quot; as a result of the rejection of more U.S. aid, she added.    Democrats, meanwhile, are working to come up with an alternative aid package that would help the Contras stay afloat without furthering their war effort. Speaker Wright's assurances to a handful of moderate Democrats that an alternative, &quot;humanitarian&quot; plan would be considered before previously approved Contra aid runs out Feb. 29 was a crucial factor in Wednesday's House rejection of the president's aid request.    But it isn't clear whether Democrats can agree on a package by the end of the month. They disagree on a number of issues -- including how the aid would be delivered and whether provision should be made for renewed weapons shipments under certain circumstances.    Nevertheless, Mr. Ortega may find it difficult to reverse the process of opening Nicaraguan society -- a process that Contra pressure helped force him to set in motion. If he attempts to crush political opponents or independent media, he could unite Managua's neighbors against him and make renewed U.S. support for the Contras more palatable. Moreover, Nicaragua's economy is crippled, and can be rehabilitated only by a new injection of Soviet assistance, which isn't likely, or by giving more freedom to the more efficient private sector.    Furthermore, even without continued U.S. aid, the Contras will keep pressure on Mr. Ortega. They have become a more viable force in recent years. Many now operate inside Nicaragua, rather than from camps in Honduras, and they have growing support from Nicaraguans who are disenchanted with the Sandinistas' rule.    Julio Ruiz Quesada of the Conservative Party, one of several Nicaraguan opposition leaders who oppose military action, concedes that &quot;we wouldn't exist as a party if the Contras didn't exist.&quot; He said the opposition plans to push Mr. Ortega's liberalization to the limit.    &quot;We think that the political fight has to move to the streets of the country,&quot; Mr. Ruiz said. &quot;We're going to put the Sandinistas to the test.&quot;    ---   Michael Allen in Managua, Nicaragua and Ellen Hume in Washington contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
