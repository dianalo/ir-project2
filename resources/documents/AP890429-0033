Relief Ministry officials who spoke on condition of anonymitysaid rescue workers searching the debris of buildings in thevillages of Saturia and Hargoz found 40 more bodies overnight.   About 12,000 people were injured when the tornado struck centralBangladesh on Wednesday and severely damaged more than 20 smallvillages.   The death toll was expected to rise further because about 400people listed as missing are now believed dead, the officials said,and bodies still were being recovered from the rubble of destroyedhomes.   The daily Bangladesh Observer said at least 5,000 people weremissing and 20,000 others injured, many of them in criticalcondition in hospitals in Dhaka and neighboring districts leveledby the storm.   Doctors at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital, considered thecountry's most modern hospital, said no deaths were reported today.However, they said they faced an acute shortage of medicine andblood.   About 400 of the injured were at the hospital, said one doctor.The government appealed to people to give blood.   The storm ravaged about 45 square miles of the Manikganjdistrict, 25 miles northwest of Dhaka.   The tornado was accompanied by hail and showers, and came hoursafter President Hussain Muhammad Ershad led nationwide prayers forrains to ease a two-month drought. In Dhaka alone, more than 75,000people joined Ershad in a service.   The drought has threatened to destroy half of the nation'sspring rice crop. Most of Bangladesh's 110 million people rely onagriculture for their livelihoods.   The daily Sangbad reported today that 100,000 people in theManikganj district faced starvation because of the tornado.   ``There is no shelter for the affected people, no food and nowater,'' the independent daily said.   An official of the Red Crescent, the Moslem equivalent of theRed Cross, said a lack of medicine and shelter also were problems.   ``Many of those who survived face starvation and have not eatensince Wednesday,'' Mohammed Rashid, a Red Crescent official inSaturia, told The Associated Press. ``It is our estimate that morethan 30,000 houses have been demolished by the tornado.''   Red Crescent officials said delays in the delivery of governmentrelief supplies had caused resentment among tornado victims.   Relief Ministry officials said they had rushed 90 tons ofsupplies to ravaged areas and planned to send more, includingmedicine, clothing and rice and biscuits.   Volunteer groups helped the Red Crescent in relief work,including digging mass graves. Arshed Ali Chowdhury, a schoolteacher at Saturia, said volunteers had buried more than 100 bodies.   Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries with an annualper capita income of $160, is repeatedly afflicted by floods anddrought.   Summer floods last year left four-fifths of the country underwater and killed at least 1,400 people. In November, cyclonesclaimed another 1,100 lives.</TEXT></DOC>
