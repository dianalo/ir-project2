(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman battling for control of sevenmicroscopic embryos said she worried about frozen storage ``killingthem,'' but her husband said bringing them to life was a mistake.   The couple, Junior Lewis Davis and Mary Sue Davis, drew aportrait of themselves Tuesday as a couple who tried desperatelyfor nine years to have a child.   Their marriage has collapsed into a battle for custody _ orownership _ of seven frozen ``pre-embryos'' that have been incryogenic storage since December.   Davis, 30, sued for divorce in February, and wants the embryosto remain in storage until the couple decide together what to dowith them.   ``I oppose the use of the pre-embryos by Mary or any donorbecause I do not wish to be raped of my reproductive rights,'' hesaid.   Mrs. Davis says she has the right to have the embryos implantedin her womb regardless of her husband's feelings.   ``I don't feel it abuses his rights,'' she testified. ``Heconsented to be a father and I'm willing to let him.''   Mrs. Davis said she objects strongly to leaving the embryos incold storage, where according to some testimony they could not lastfor more than two years.   ``I believe that would be killing them,'' she said. ``I am themother of these embryos. They are the beginning of life. They aremore than just cells that mean nothing.''   Davis acknowledged his wife has gone through physical andemotional trauma during their six attempts at conception in the invitro program, which they entered in 1985.   ``But I can't see where that's enough to bring a child into thisworld where the child will have more pain than it cost us toachieve it,'' he said.   ``I don't want my child in a single-parent home,'' Davis told W.Dale Young, the Blount County Circuit Court judge hearing the case.``I was raised in a broken home and I don't want that for mychild.''   Both Junior and Mary Sue Davis, 28, come from families of sixchildren.   Mrs. Davis' attorney, Jay Christenberry, contends the embryosshould be considered ``pre-born children'' and allowed to come toterm in Mrs. Davis' body.   Charles Clifford, attorney for Davis, said there have beentremendous advances in helping infertile women such as Mrs. Davis.He contends that because she could reasonably expect to becomepegnant with another man after her divorce, it is unnecessary touse these particular seven embryos.   Under his questioning, zoologist Alex Shivers said the successrate of in vitro programs ``will definitely go up'' in comingyears. Testimony Monday indicated the national average forsuccessful implantations is 18 percent.   The Davises said they met in West Germany while in the Army andmarried nine years ago. Mrs. Davis suffered five tubal pregnancies,one of which she said nearly killed her.   The couple tried adoption, only to be told they had littlechance of becoming parents that way. They joined the Big Brothersprogram, taking a child under their wing until its mother ``startedusing us sort of as a baby-sitting service,'' Davis said.   The trial, which began Monday, recessed until Thursday.   Young is expected to rule within a month.   The embroyos are in cryogenic storage at minus 180 degreesCentigrade.   Davis said he does not want the embryos destroyed, just leftalone. ``Three years down the road I might have a change ofheart,'' he said.   In vitro fertilization produces so-called ``test-tube babies''because the fertilization takes place outside the womb. The processwas pioneered in England, where the first successful birth wasrecorded in 1978.   The embryos in the Davis case were less than two days old whenthey were frozen, and consist of four to eight undifferentiatedcells each, according to testimony. It is 12 to 14 days afterfertilization before the cells start to take on differentcharacteristics and technically are considered embryos, scientiststestified.</TEXT></DOC>
