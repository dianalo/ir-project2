(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Peter CoffeeandM;Like all new ideas, RISC has gone through three stages: &quot;that's crazy,&quot;&quot;that's impractical&quot; and, finally, &quot;that's obvious.&quot;andM;In their early years, RISC machines were high performers, but a lack ofsoftware limited their appeal to business users.andP;  Today, bolstered by plentyof available software, RISC is ready to enter the &quot;it's obvious&quot; stage.andM;&quot;We recently recommended that a client acquire a couple of Sun [RISC-basedmachines],&quot; reported one consultant, because &quot;the software they needed wasavailable only for the Sun, and it had the processing power to meet theirneeds.&quot;andM;He noted that the same software was also available for the 680X0-based Sun-3,a popular series of CISC machines from Sun Microsystems Inc. of MountainView, Calif.andP;  However, the Sun-3 software was available only as source code(requiring recompilation) rather than as the off-the-shelf binary codeavailable for the RISC-based Sun-4 systems.andM;&quot;In this case, timing was an issue, so the client opted to get theshrink-wrap rather than a custom build,&quot; the consultant said in a recentdiscussion on the CompuServe Computer Consultants' Forum, an electronicbulletin board.andM;Ironically, this &quot;shrink-wrap&quot; advantage worked in favor of the Sun-3 seriesas recently as last year.andP;  Since then, however, Sun's commitment to reducedinstruction sets in the form of its Scalable Processor Architecture (SPARC),has moved the Sun-4 systems into the lead as the preferred platform for manynew workstation applications.andM;A catalog of third-party &quot;SPARCware&quot; for the Sun-4 and its clones lists about700 products in areas ranging from &quot;academic/research&quot; through&quot;visualization, graphics and animation.&quot;andM;PC users considering SPARC will recognize the Interleaf Desktop Publisher,the SCO Professional, a 1-2-3 work-alike spreadsheet, and WordPerfect amongcurrent SPARCware offerings.andM;SPARC is becoming an attractive platform for software development due toaggressive licensing of the design by Sun to other companies.andM;An independent association of SPARC licensees, SPARC International, promotessoftware development for this emerging standard.andM;Sun isn't the only maker of CISC machines to embrace the higherprice/performance ratio that comes with RISC technology.andP;  Digital EquipmentCorp. has licensed RISC processors from MIPS Computer Systems Inc.; Digital'sRISC-based DECstations currently support such popular applications as AutoCADfor computer-aided drafting, SPICE for electronic circuit simulation, andSimscript, a high-level language for simulating complex systems.andM;Technical users aren't the only ones to enjoy this surge of RISC-basedsoftware.andP;  DECstation users can also take their pick from a wide range ofbusiness packages such as databases from Oracle Corp., Informix SoftwareInc., Ingres Corp. and Unify Corp.; spreadsheets such as Q-Calc from UnipressSoftware Inc. and UltraCalc II from Olympus Software Inc.; and interfaces tostandard desktop PCs, such as PC-Interface from Locus Computing Corp.andM;MIPS also continues to sell RISC-based systems under its own label,supporting third-party software (dubbed &quot;RISCware&quot;) across an equally broadrange of applications.andP;  Mathematica, from Wolfram Research Inc., is apowerful symbolic mathematics program available for MIPS machines; MIPS alsosupports a host of databases, spreadsheets and other productivity productssimilar to other Unix systems.andM;Another emerging platform for RISC-based applications is the Motorola Inc.andO;88000, a chip set comprising the 88100 processor and the 88200 memorymanager.andM;To take maximum advantage of this wide range of platforms, the 88000 hasbecome the focus of a multivendor standardization effort by the 88openStandardization Consortium Ltd., based in Wilsonville, Ore.andM;88open publishes a catalog that currently lists almost 100 products complyingwith binary and/or object-level compatibility standards, allowing them to runon any manufacturer's compliant hardware.andM;The consortium also operates an independent testing facility that willcertify software as compliant at no cost to the software developer.andP;  Thiseffort seeks to give the 88000 the same level of &quot;shrink-wrap compatibility&quot;long taken for granted by users of mainstream PCs.andM;Last, and until lately very much least, has been IBM's RT series ofRISC-based machines.andP;  These have been popular among business-orientedresellers but have gained little ground in the core of the workstationmarket.andM;The first-generation RT family has been effectively eclipsed by recentannouncements of IBM's new RISC System/6000 series.andP;  These aren't evencompatible with their predecessors, except at the source-code level; arecompilation is required to run them.andM;IBM reportedly postponed formally announcing these new machines so that therecould be substantial third-party software available at their introduction, astrategy that worked well with the company's AS/400 minicomputers (seerelated story at right).andP;  From early reports, the performance of these newmachines will make them serious competition for other RISCs.andM;Of course, there is much more to a desktop platform than raw performance andshrink-wrapped software.andP;  In corporations, no new system can be fullyaccepted until it is a convenient and productive platform for new in-housedevelopment.andP;  The hardships of development retarded corporate acceptance ofthe Apple Macintosh for at least two years, and RISC proponents have beencareful to avoid a similar fate.andM;To begin with, every major RISC machine runs some version of the Unixoperating system, an environment well known for its broad range of flexibledevelopment tools.andP;  Unix is unusual in that the operating system itself islargely written in C rather than in the hardware-specific assembly language,so that Unix can quickly be made available on these new platforms.andM;&quot;The problem with Unix is that its commands look like line noise,&quot; quippedone satisfied user of VMS on Digital's CISC-based VAXstations, referring toterse and cryptic command names with single-letter, case-sensitive options.andM;This criticism is being addressed by modern, graphically oriented Unixinterfaces such as NextStep, OSF/Motif and Open Look, variously supported onthe platforms mentioned above.andP;  These platforms also support every majordevelopment language, from C and COBOL to LISP, Ada and variousfourth-generation tools.andM;The challenge now is to develop more advanced compilers that can fullyexploit the greater flexibility of reduced instruction sets and &quot;pipelined&quot;hardware.andP;  As development tools become better fitted to RISC hardware, andprice/performance trends continue down the production learning curve, RISCmachines are likely to capture an increasing share of the desktop computingmarket.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
