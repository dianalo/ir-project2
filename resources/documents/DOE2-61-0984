We determine the full interacting quantum hamiltonian to allloop orders in perturbation theory. The free action has a new highlynon-linear symmetry acting on the string field, and the kinetic operator.Perturbatively we demonstrate that the new theory gives the correct expressionfor the cosmological constant that is ultraviolet finite to one-looporder.</TEXT></DOC>
