Ciba-Geigy Corp. is the subject of a criminalinvestigation by the U.S. attorney in Newark, N.J., focusingon the company's promotion of its arthritis drug Voltaren,including the use of baseball great Mickey Mantle as atelevision talk-show pitchman for Voltaren.</LP><TEXT>   The company acknowledged receiving a grand jury subpoenafrom the Justice Department Sept. 3 for all Voltaren-relateddocuments as it announced an unprecedented agreement with theFood and Drug Administration to revamp its marketingstrategies to prevent prescription drug promotional abuses.   The agreement spells out more clearly than ever what theFDA will tolerate in the way of drug promotions. The accordis expected to deter industry tendencies toward consumeradvertising hype and have a chilling effect on the use ofcelebrity spokesmen, one of many promotional practices theagency has deep misgivings about.   Under the agreement, Ciba-Geigy canceled a controversialad campaign for its gallstone-dissolving drug Actigall andswore off using sports and film stars as corporate spokesmenfor its products.   In Summit, N.J., Ciba-Geigy defended its businesspractices and pledged to cooperate with the grand juryinvestigation. &quot;We have always sought to conduct our businessin full compliance with all laws and regulations andconsistent with our operating principles, and we willcontinue to do so,&quot; a company spokesman said.   For U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff, the federal prosecutorin Newark, the issuance of the subpoena to Ciba-Geigy marks asignificant expansion of a criminal inquiry into thepromotion of unapproved drug uses and misleading drug claims.In June, the Justice Department confirmed that Johnson andamp;Johnson's promotion of its acne medicine Retin-A as awrinkle-prevention cream is under investigation.   And for FDA Commissioner David Kessler, the agreement withCiba-Geigy was the second ground-breaking accord to benegotiated with a major pharmaceutical company. In May,Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. agreed to stop promoting severalunapproved -- and unproven -- uses of six cancer drugs,including the best sellers in its $850 million-a-year line ofoncological products. The company also promised to notifythousands of physicians that it had disguised a Bristol-Myerspromotional publication as a medical journal.   The FDA agreement with Ciba-Geigy was reached in Juneafter three months of negotiations with FDA officials, butthe company chose not to announce it. Yesterday, the companydenied that its announcement was designed to blunt adversepublicity about the grand jury inquiry. &quot;It's not connectedwith the subpoena,&quot; said spokeswoman Cathy Kernan.   The agreement reflects the FDA's reservations about theability of drug makers to balance the benefits ofprescription drugs with the risks when they have celebritiespromote their products in public appearances. Another concernis that consumers assume the celebrities are providingobjective unpaid endorsements when in fact they are hired todo so.   The problem was highlighted in 1988 when Mr. Mantle, theformer New York Yankee slugger and a Hall of Famer, made thetalk show rounds, including an appearance on NBC-TV's&quot;Today,&quot; to tout the wonders of Voltaren. That appearanceprompted the network's science reporter to respond a few dayslater that the improvement in Mr. Mantle's arthritic kneeswas &quot;hardly a miracle,&quot; but was &quot;just the first time he wastreated with anything other than aspirin.&quot;   Ciba-Geigy also used another Yankee great -- pitcherWhitey Ford -- as a Voltaren spokesman on a Miami radio talkshow in 1988 and actress Shirley Jones as a spokeswoman forits estrogen-replacement drug Estraderm in some 1989 and 1990appearances before women's seminars on menopause, accordingto Ms. Kernan, the CibaGeigy spokeswoman. Actress DebbieReynolds also appeared at one seminar.   In agreeing to discontinue the use of celebrity spokesmen,Ciba-Geigy acknowledged having trouble ensuring thatphysicians who accompanied the celebrities got an opportunityto provide &quot;fair balance&quot; regarding products' benefits andpotential side effects. The physicians usually couldn't &quot;geta word in edgewise,&quot; because talk show hosts were preoccupiedwith interviewing the celebrities, said Ms. Kernan.   Ciba-Geigy stopped running its Actigall ads in majornewspapers and magazines in June after FDA officialscomplained that the ads didn't adequately inform consumersthat surgery is the preferred treatment for most patientswith gallstones, rather than Actigall.   In addition, the company promised to &quot;redouble itsefforts&quot; to ensure that its claims of superiority over rivaldrugs are based on data from well-controlled clinical trialsand jibe with the body of available clinical data. FDAofficials said they objected to Ciba-Geigy's claims thatVoltaren is safer than other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs when it has been found to be more harmful to the liver.   On its own initiative, the company said it has reassessedall of its prescription-drug marketing practices and beguntightening internal controls to ensure that all of itspromotional materials are checked by the company's medicaland legal experts for compliance with FDA regulations.   The company also said it has taken steps to ensure thatthe Ciba-Geigy-sponsored symposia for doctors arenonpromotional in tone and discuss alternative therapies, notjust the company's products. At the same time, Ciba-Geigypromised to prepare video news release and public-relationsstatements in such a way that it would be difficult fortelevision stations and newspapers to edit out informationthat fairly balances drug benefits against risks.</TEXT></DOC>
