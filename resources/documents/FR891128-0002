These factors are a national bank's net worth and/orits liquidity. In addition, this final rule changes the OCC's method ofmeasuring net worth for insolvency purposes. The major change in measuringa bank's net worth is the use of equity capital, rather than primary capital.By using equity capital as the measure, a bank's allowance for loan andlease losses (``ALLL''), also known as the loan loss reserve, is excludedfrom the calculation of net worth. This change is intended to bring theOCC's measurement of net worth more closely in line with generally acceptedaccounting principles (``GAAP''). This final rule does not alter the methodof determining insolvency on a liquidity basis. In adopting this amendment,the OCC does not limit its discretion to consider other factors in assessingthe solvency of a national bank. Further, the OCC expects to continue itslong-standing practice of satisfying itself of a bank's insolvency on acase-by-case basis, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstancesinvolving the particular bank under consideration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>December 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Ferne Fishman Rubin, Attorney,Legal Advisory Services Division, (202) 447-1882, or Kennard L. Page, NationalBank Examiner, Special Supervision Division, (202) 447-1719.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The OCC published a notice of proposed rulemaking (``NPRM'') in connectionwith this amendment on July 5, 1989 (54 FR 28072). Subsequently, BankingBulletin 89-26 was issued to bring the NPRM to the attention of the bankingcommunity.The OCC is issuing this rule for two reasons. First, as 12 U.S.C. 191 isnot specific as to what constitutes ``insolvency,'' the OCC has great latitudein determining whether a national bank is insolvent. Therefore, the OCCbelieves it will be helpful to specify, in the form of a regulation, certainof the factors it may consider in determining insolvency. Second, the OCCwants to notify the public of a change in the method by which it will measurenational banks' net worth in making insolvency determinations.The OCC's decision to change its method of measuring a bank's net worthfor the purpose of determining solvency is based upon the following considerations:andbullet; The OCC's experience indicates that the public interest will bebetter served by closing a bank when the institution's equity capital hasbeen depleted. Events during the past several years have shown that oncea bank's equity capital is exhausted, the bank has virtually no chanceof recovery without government or outside intervention. Recapitalizationby existing ownership has been rare. Moreover, it has been the OCC's experiencethat permitting an institution to continue operations when its owners nolonger have any financial interests at stake encourages imprudent operations,including occasional abuse of high-cost funding sources, and results inincreased losses. Such continued operations also adversely affect the industryas a whole, placing healthy competitors at a disadvantage.andbullet; The change in calculating net worth is needed to make the OCC'spractices conform more directly with GAAP.andbullet; The OCC believes that the final rule will facilitate the saleof insolvent instututions and result in savings to the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation (``FDIC'').andbullet; The OCC believes that banks with no equity capital may experiencea loss in customer confidence and therefore may not be influenced by constraintsordinarily imposed by market discipline. By using equity capital to measurea bank's net worth, such situations may occur less frequently.<ITAG tagnum="84">Legal Discussion </ITAG>(1) <T3>Statutory Authority</T3>. Under 12 U.S.C. 191, ``[w]henever the comptroller* * * become[s] satisfied of the insolvency of a national banking association,he may * * * appoint a receiver, who shall proceed to close up such association.''Case law interpreting this authority has established that the Comptrollerhas a great deal of discretion in reaching a determination of insolvency.<T3>Adams </T3>v. <T3>Nagle</T3>, 303 U.S. 532 (1938) (``<T3>Adams</T3>''); <T3>Liberty National Bank of South Carolina </T3>v. <T3>McIntosh</T3>, 16 F.2d 906 (4th Cir. 1927). (2) <T3>Insolvency Factors</T3>. The factors the OCC has ordinarily consideredin determining whether a national bank is insolvent are net worth and liquidity.Under the net worth factor, a national bank may be declared insolvent whenits liabilities exceed its assets. <T3>Commercial National Bank in Shreveport </T3>v. <T3>Connolly</T3>, 176 F.2d 1004 (5th Cir. 1949). Under the liquidity factor,a bank may be declared insolvent when it is unable to meet its obligationsas they mature. <T3>Smith </T3>v. <T3>Witherow</T3>, 102 F.2d 638 (3d Cir. 1939) (``<T3>Smith</T3>''); <T3>In re Liquidation of Franklin National Bank</T3>, 381 F. Supp. 1390(E.D.N.Y. 1974) (``<T3>Franklin</T3>''). In the past, the OCC has considered these factors in declaring banks insolvent,using case-by-case analyses. <T3>See In re Conservatorship of Wellsville National Bank</T3>, 407 F.2d223 (3d Cir.), <T3>cert. denied</T3>, 396 U.S. 832, <T3>reh. denied</T3>, 396 U.S. 949 (1969) (``<T3>Wellsville</T3>''); <T3>Franklin</T3>, 381 F. Supp. 1390 (E.D.N.Y. 1974) (use of either factorappropriate under 12 U.S.C. 191). A bank can be insolvent under both factors.<T3>See Golden Pacific Bancorp </T3>v. <T3>Clarke</T3>, No. 85-2384 (D.D.C. 1986), <T3>aff'd</T3>, 837 F.2d 809 (D.C. Cir.), <T3>cert. denied</T3>, 109 S. Ct. 233 (1988). The OCC is not limited tothese two factors and may employ others to determine insolvency. However,this final rule discusses only the net worth and liquidity factors. Inits current form, andSection; 5.49 does not set forth any criteria for determiningthe insolvency of a national bank. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Final Rule </ITAG>This final rule amends the receivership provisions and deletes the conservatorshipprovisions of 12 CFR 5.49. Section 5.49 deals with the appointment of receiversunder 12 U.S.C. 191 and conservators under 12 U.S.C. 201 <T3>et seq</T3>., the Bank Conservation Act (``BCA'').On August 9, 1989, the BCA was substantially amended by the Financial InstitutionsReform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, Public Law No. 101-73, 103Stat. 183 (``FIRREA''). The current conservatorship provisions in andSection;5.49 are inconsistent with the language of the BCA, as amended. Therefore,these provisions are deleted, and the authority citation and title of theregulation are amended accordingly. The OCC may exercise its authorityunder the BCA without a regulation; thus, this authority is not limitedor otherwise affected by the changes implemented by this regulation. The receivership provisions of andSection; 5.49 set forth the OCC's authorityto appoint a receiver. In most cases, the OCC appoints the FDIC as receiver.<T3>See </T3>12 U.S.C. 1821(c). Section 5.49 also establishes certain proceduresfor the payment of claims in cases in which the OCC does not appoint theFDIC as receiver. The final rule changes the receivership provisions of andSection; 5.49 toarticulate the net worth and liquidity factors for determining nationalbank insolvency. In addition, this final rule establishes a new methodof measuring a national bank's net worth for insolvency purposes, but doesnot change the method of measuring liquidity for insolvency purposes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Primary Capital and Equity Capital </ITAG>The OCC has declared national banks insolvent on a net worth basis whenprimary capital is depleted, <T3>i.e.</T3>, when a bank's liabilities exceed its assets plus its ALLL.For this purpose, the OCC has used the definition of ``primary capital''found at 12 CFR 3.2(c). The OCC has considered a bank's primary capitalto be a functional substitute for its net worth. This approach has notbeen required by law, but has been used as an internal guideline. With this final rule, the OCC is conforming its definition of net worthto GAAP. Now, the OCC will measure net worth as the bank's equity capital,<T3>i.e.,</T3> its assets minus its liabilities. The ALLL will not be counted.Thus, the OCC may declare a bank insolvent when its equity capital (ratherthan its primary capital) is exhausted. For the purpose of determininginsolvency, the bank's equity capital will include:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Common shareholders' equity. ``Common shareholders' equity'' meanscommon stock, common stock surplus, undivided profits, capital reserves,adjustments for the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation,less any net unrealized loss on marketable equity securities.\1\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\The final clause in this definition, ``less any net unrealizedloss on marketable securities,'' has been altered slightly from the languagein the NPRM. This change is not substantive. It has been made to conformthe final rule with the Instructions for Consolidated Reports of Conditionand Income (call report instructions) promulgated by the Federal FinancialInstitutions Examination Council.<ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Preferred stock and related surplus.</ITAG>This measure of equity omits items with characteristics of both debt andequity. For example, long-term subordinated debt and mandatory convertibledebt instruments are not counted as equity. However, debt may convert toequity capital as defined above; upon conversion, it will be included ina bank's equity capital.The major difference between the OCC's past use of primary capital formeasuring a bank's net worth and the final rule's use of equity capitalfor the same purpose is the exclusion of the bank's ALLL. This revisedmeasurement of net worth does not alter the OCC's requirement that allnational banks maintain an adequate ALLL. A bank's failure to maintainan adequate ALLL is unsafe or unsound banking practice that may resultin a cease and desist order under 12 U.S.C. 1818(b). Such failure may alsoconstitute a violation of 12 U.S.C. 161 which may result in the impositionof civil money penalties under 12 U.S.C. 93(b) and 12 U.S.C. 1818(i).<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments received</ITAG>The OCC received 15 comments in response to the NPRM. The commenters includenational banks, thrift and banking industry trade associations, and a committeecomprised of members from academia and the industry. Generally, this committeeanalyzes numerous issues facing the financial services industry. Nine commentersgenerally favored the OCC's proposal; six commenters generally opposedthe new regulation.The major issues raised by the commenters fall into five categories. Thesecategories are: (1) The OCC's use of different definitions of capital;(2) exclusion of the ALLL from the net worth calculation; (3) treatmentof hybrid debt-equity instruments; (4) case-by-case application of thenew rule; and (5) additional comments and suggestions. Each comment categoryis discussed below.(1) The OCC's Use of Different Definitions of CapitalA number of commenters objected to the use of different definitions ofcapital. Some commenters suggested that the OCC should use the definitionof capital adopted in the Risk-Based Capital (``RBC'') Guidelines for determininginsolvency on a net worth basis.The OCC is aware that differing definitions of capital could cause someconfusion, and has considered adopting the RBC definition of capital forthe purpose of determining net worth insolvency. For the reasons discussedbelow, however, the OCC has determined that the definition of capital fordetermining net worth insolvency serves a different purpose than determiningthe adequacy of a bank's capital on an ongoing basis. In this regard, theRBC definition of capital is inappropriate as a measure for determininga bank's solvency.In a net worth calculation, the amount of capital available to a businessis one measure of its viability at a specific time. For all businesses,equity capital represents the shareholders' ownership interest. To theextent of this ownership interest, shareholders may participate in lossesfrom business operations.Unlike most businesses, however, some liabilities of national banks, <T3>i.e.,</T3> deposits up to a statutory limit, are insured. Thus, notonly national bank owners risk losses as a result of bank actions; FDICfunds are also at stake. As equity capital is diminished through losses,greater and greater risk of loss is shifted to FDIC funds. By its nature,this shifting of risk occurs in failing banks and may encourage less sounddecisions and operations. To minimize the possibility of significant lossesto the FDIC funds, the OCC has concluded that a definition of capital thatemphasizes equity, and thus, <T3>owner</T3> participation in business losses, is appropriate.In contrast, the RBC Guidelines consider the amount of capital necessaryto support the credit risk inherent in a bank's assets, and require theminimum capital-to-risk-weighted-assets ratio to be met over the operatinglife of the bank. Thus, the RBC definition includes limits on <T3>some </T3>intangible assets, such as qualifying mortgage servicingrights and goodwill. The definition of equity capital under the net worthfactor, however, does not specifically exclude intangible assets. Thistreatment reflects the fact that all assets_tangible and intangible_aresubject to the same GAAP and regulatory accounting requirements for recognizingimpairments in their value. Specifically, such an impairment must be recordedas a current charge to earnings, in turn reducing equity capital. Thus,equity capital reflects only unimpaired asset values, the most meaningfulmeasure for insolvency purposes.Further, unlike the requirements of RBC, it is not necessary or appropriateto make qualitative distinctions or place quantitative limitations on thecomponents eligible to make up net worth for insolvency purposes. Therefore,to calculate the net worth of a national bank, the OCC will consider allof its preferred stock instruments without limitation, regardless of theirperpetual or limited life nature. This treatment is appropriate for a determinationof the solvency of a bank at a specific time. Limited life preferred instrumentsthat have not matured still represent shareholders' ownership. Thus, theseinstruments should be included in the measure of the bank's net worth forsolvency purposes.Additionally, under RBC, a bank may include Tier 2 capital components onlyto the extent of its Tier 1 total. If the bank has Tier 2 elements thatexceed its Tier 1 total, it may not include that excess in calculatingits risk-based capital ratio. This limitation is unnecessarily restrictivein the context of a solvency determination, because some of the componentsof Tier 2 represent shareholders' ownership. This final rule does not limitthe use of any capital component that qualifies as equity for determiningthe insolvency of a national bank.(2) Exclusion of the ALLL from the Net Worth CalculationMany commenters addressed the OCC's exclusion of the ALLL from the networth calculation. Most of these commenters supported the exclusion. Commenterswho opposed the exclusion argued that the OCC should include at least partof the ALLL in the definition of capital for the purpose of the net worthfactor.Under GAAP and regulatory accounting principles (``RAP''), all banks arerequired to maintain an ALLL adequate to cover estimated losses inherentin their loan portfolios. The ALLL is a ``valuation reserve'' account,measuring the amount of impairment over the lives of the loans in a bank'sportfolio. Because the ALLL is dedicated to absorbing estimated loan andlease losses, and its level is set to reflect the estimated value impairmentin the loan portfolio, it is not appropriate to include any portion ofthe ALLL in the measure of equity capital used for insolvency purposes.A number of the commenters preferred using the RBC definition of capital.These commenters apparently assumed that, as a result, ALLL up to a maximumof 1.25% of a bank's risk-weighted assets could be counted toward a bank'sequity capital. These commenters may not have fully considered the applicationof the RBC definition in the context of net worth insolvency. An examplemay help to illustrate this application, and the accounting treatment ofthe ALLL.Assume that a bank experiencing substantial loan losses has depleted itsALLL through charge-offs. To comply with GAAP and RAP requirements, thebank must replenish its ALLL to reflect remaining estimated losses in itsloan portfolio. The ALLL is replenished through a provision expense chargedagainst current earnings, and ultimately is reflected as a decrease inundivided profits. Because undivided profits are an element of common shareholders'equity, replenishing the ALLL decreases the bank's equity capital. If theOCC used the RBC definition of capital for the determination of net worthinsolvency, this decrease would reduce the amount of the bank's Tier 1capital. Having reduced its Tier 1 capital, the bank would also have toreduce the amount of any Tier 2 capital that it could use to calculatetotal capital. Thus, as a bank approaches insolvency, fewer and fewer ofits Tier 2 capital components are included in determining net worth, becausemost of its Tier 1 capital becomes exhausted.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In addition to the issues discussed above, several commenterswere concerned over the determination of the adequacy of the ALLL givenits exclusion from the net worth factor. In response to this concern, itshould be noted that bankers and examiners must follow the guidelines currentlyset forth in Banking Circular 201, and in section 217 of the <T3>Comptroller's Handbook for National Bank Examiners</T3>.(3) Treatmentof Hybrid Debt-Equity InstrumentsHybrid capital instruments such as subordinated, perpetual and mandatoryconvertible debt combine the characteristics of debt and equity. Some commenterssuggested that the OCC count hybrid debt-equity instruments as equity indetermining solvency. These commenters pointed to the treatment of theseinstruments in the RBC Guidelines to support this view.The OCC recognizes that these instruments often improve the overall strengthof a bank's capital position. Thus, the final RBC guidelines allow banksto include hybrid debt-equity instruments in Tier 2 capital. These instrumentsmay be counted as capital (up to a specified proportion of Tier 1 capital)in meeting the RBC requirements. However, as explained above, as Tier 1disappears due to losses, those hybrid instruments in Tier 2 are no longerincluded in the sum of capital items for RBC calculations. Thus, excludingthese instruments from the sum of accounts that determine a bank's solvencyis consistent with their treatment in the RBC guidelines.Another important consideration for the purpose of determining insolvencyis that these instruments are not available to protect against losses whilethe issuer is operating as a going concern. That is, they do not providethe ability to defer payments, which might be needed when a bank experienceslosses or is confronted by other financial pressures. Thus, the OCC hasdetermined that hybrid instruments should not be treated as equity forthe purpose of determining solvency. However, as noted above, debt mayconvert to ``equity capital'', as that term is defined in the final rule;upon conversion, it will be included in a bank's equity capital.Finally, hybrid debt-equity instruments should not be included in the definitionof equity capital for insolvency purposes because the rights and interestsof a bank's debtholders are different from those of its shareholders. Debtholdersdo not have the voting rights of common shareholders, and therefore exerciselittle control over the bank. In addition, after their contractual interestpayments are received, debtholders have no claim on a bank's residual profits.Thus, the rights and interests of a bank's debtholders are similar to thoseof its uninsured depositors, rather than its shareholders.(4) Case-by-Case Application of the New RuleSeveral commenters expressed concern that the new rule will be appliedin a rigid manner. These commenters suggested that the OCC will not takeinto account all relevant facts of a particular situation in determiningsolvency. In this regard, the OCC expects to continue its long-standingpractice of making determinations of insolvency on a case-by-base basis,taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances involving theparticular bank under consideration.One commenter expressed the opinion that the OCC's reservation of the rightto consider factors other than the two factors set forth in the regulationundermines the OCC's goal of stating the ``specific'' measurements thatit usually uses in determining national bank insolvency. With regard tothis point, the OCC is responsible for ensuring the safety and soundnessof the national banking system and needs flexibility in its decision-making.That flexibility is granted by the language of 12 U.S.C. 191 and case law,and is merely reaffirmed in this final rule. The OCC will continue itspractice of making determinations of insolvency on a case-by-case basis.The OCC anticipates that the two factors set forth in the new regulationwill cover the vast majority of situations. Thus, the OCC is being as specificas possible in giving guidance, while maintaining the necessary flexibilityto respond to diverse situations.Two commenters suggested that, under the amended regulation, the OCC mightclose a bank prematurely before adequate recapitalization or the most advantageoussale, merger or other disposition of the bank could be arranged. Clearly,the submission of an adequate recapitalization plan, or the existence ofa feasible merger, purchase and assumption, sale, or other agreement whichwill likely result in the successful disposition of the bank, may be consideredby the OCC as part of its insolvency decision-making process. Twelve U.S.C.191 provides that when the OCC becomes satisfied of the insolvency of anational bank, it ``<T3>may</T3> * * * appoint a receiver.'' Thus, it is established that theOCC is not required by law to close an insolvent bank immediately. <T3>Easton</T3> v. <T3>Iowa</T3>, 188 U.S. 220 (1903). This final rule is consistent withthe statute and relevant case law.Another commenter thought that the new rule would result in the closingof solvent banks, because the ALLL in a particular bank may be more thanadequate to cover its estimated loan losses. In this regard, it shouldbe noted that the issue of whether a bank's ALLL is adequate will be oneof the factors the OCC will consider in satisfying itself that the bankis insolvent.Some commenters are concerned that the OCC would close a national bankwithout notice at the moment the bank exhausts its equity capital. In theabsence of fraud, insider abuse or other unusual circumstances, the OCCgenerally notifies bank management and directors of the need for additionalcapital in advance of possible closure. This practice gives the bank achance to raise capital. In fact, in the vast majority of cases, the OCChas worked very closely with bank management and directors in an effortto recapitalize and correct deficiencies cited by national bank examiners.In sum, a determination of insolvency and closing are usually the finalactions after the OCC has worked with the bank over time in an effort tohelp the bank solve its problems and increase its capital.(5) Additional Comments and SuggestionsIn addition to the general categories of comments discussed above, severalcommenters raised issues that cannot be placed into a particular category.One commenter expressed the opinion that the new rule will apply to savingsassociations because section 301 of FIRREA provides that the capital standardsprescribed by the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision ``shallbe no less stringent than the capital standards applicable to nationalbanks.'' This regulation is being adopted by the OCC to set forth insolvencyfactors for national banks. The definition of ``equity capital'' in theregulation is intended to apply only to national banks. Furthermore, thisfinal rule has been developed pursuant to its statutory authority in 12U.S.C. 191, a statute very different from the insolvency statute whichapplies to thrifts.Two commenters suggested a phase-in period for the new regulation. As notedabove, this final rule is consistent with the OCC's authority under 12U.S.C. 191 and relevant case law, which provide the OCC a great deal ofdiscretion in determining whether a national bank is insolvent. The OCCcould have implemented this change in its practice without promulgatinga formal regulation. The OCC's use of the rulemaking process has effectivelyserved the same purpose as a phase-in period, by notifying the bankingcommunity of the proposed change in the OCC's practice and providing anopportunity to comment on the proposal.Another commenter suggested that the OCC should measure equity capitalon the basis of current market values rather than book values. This isnot precluded by the amended regulation. The OCC may use market valuesand other measurements of value, under appropriate circumstances. Further,as noted above, this final rule does not alter the OCC's discretion toconsider other factors in assessing the solvency of a national bank.One commenter requested the deletion of the word ``usually'' in BankingBulletin 89-26 and the preamble to the notice of proposed rulemaking. Thisword had been used in these documents, but not in the proposed regulationitself, in the context of a discussion of the factors ``usually'' consideredby the OCC in determining insolvency of a national bank. The word ``usually'',like the word ``may'' used in the proposed and final regulation, is intendedto preserve the OCC's flexibility and discretion in making insolvency decisions.The same commenter also felt that different insolvency standards are appliedto small and large banks. This perception is inaccurate. While the solvencyof each national bank is determined on a case-by-case basis, all banksare judged according to the same insolvency factors, regardless of theirsize.Another commenter suggested that the OCC adopt an additional, ``profitability''standard of insolvency. In the alternative, the commenter proposed expandingthe net worth factor to recognize a profitable going concern. As expressedabove, the final rule does not preclude the OCC's consideration of otherfactors, including profitability. After the final rule is adopted, theOCC will continue its current practice of satisfying itself of a bank'sinsolvency on a case-by-case basis.This commenter also proposed that the OCC implement a notice and rebuttalmechanism, whereby banks would be notified when they may be declared insolventby the OCC, and would be given a right to rebut and appeal the determinationof insolvency. In this respect, neither 12 U.S.C. 191 nor case law providesfor a hearing and review procedure. It is well-established that the specialcharacter of bank insolvencies justifies the absence of pre-insolvencyhearings. <T3>See</T3>, <T3>e.g.</T3>, <T3>Franklin</T3>, 381 F. Supp. at 1392; <T3>Cf. Fahey </T3>v.<T3> Mallonee</T3>, 332 U.S. 245, 253 (1947).Further, national banks are aware of their level of equity capital andare on notice of the basic factors the OCC usually considers in makinginsolvency determinations. Moreover, as discussed above, in the absenceof fraud, insider abuse or other unusual circumstances, the OCC works withbank management and directors over a period of time in an effort to recapitalizethe bank and avoid its insolvency. Thus, numerous mechanisms are alreadyin place to ``warn'' banks of trouble and to give banks the opportunityto respond to the OCC's concerns.Similarly, under the better-reasoned authorities, the OCC's declarationof insolvency is not subject to judicial review. <T3>See</T3>, <T3>e.g.</T3>, <T3>Wellsville</T3>, 407 F.2d 223 (3d Cir.), <T3>cert. denied</T3>, 396 U.S. 832, <T3>reh. denied</T3>, 396 U.S. 949 (1969); <T3>Wannamaker </T3>v. <T3>Edisto National Bank of Orangeburg</T3>, 62 F.2d 696 (4th Cir. 1933);<T3>Munro </T3>v. <T3>Post</T3>, 23 F. Supp. 308 (E.D.N.Y. 1938), <T3>aff'd</T3>, 102 F.2d 686 (2d Cir. 1939). The OCC's insolvency determinationinvolves ``agency action * * * committed to agency discretion by law''and, thus, is exempt from judicial review under the Administrative ProcedureAct, 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(2).Moreover, the plain language of 12 U.S.C. 191 places the determinationof national bank insolvency within the Comptroller's discretion becauseinsolvency occurs ``whenever the comptroller shall become satisfied of''its existence. The need for prompt action and the nature of the decisionto close a national bank, involving agency expertise on a wide range ofeconomic and policy matters, strongly support non-reviewability. <T3>See, e.g., Adams, </T3> 303 U.S. at 540-541 (1938); <T3>Suntex Dairy </T3>v. <T3>Block</T3>, 666 F.2d 158, 164 (5th Cir.), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>459 U.S. 826 (1982).The proposed rule does not change this principle of non-reviewability.Specifically, the OCC is not restricting its discretion with respect todetermining insolvency in such a manner as to permit judicial review. Thelanguage in the proposed rule has been modified to make clear this intent.Accordingly, the final rule does not articulate definite standards thatrigidly define insolvency. Rather, the rule publicly describes factorsthat may, among others, be considered by the OCC in determining whetherit is satisfied that insolvency exists.A few commenters expressed doubt concerning OCC's reference to a loss incustomer confidence as a reason in support of its proposal. The OCC believesthat deposit withdrawals have occurred in banks having no equity capitaldue to declines in depositor confidence in such institutions.Certain commenters questioned the impact on the FDIC funds of the proposedregulation. The OCC anticipates that the FDIC will benefit from the newrule in two ways. First, the FDIC receives the benefit of any amounts heldin a failed bank's ALLL intended to cover estimated losses in the bank'sloan portfolio. This factor should reduce the FDIC's costs connected withthe disposition of the institution. Second, the OCC believes that thisfinal rule will increase the number of potential investors for insolventnational banks. Investor interest should be greater in a bank which isclosed before it accrues substantial operating losses in excess of itscapital.Finally, one commenter was concerned that the liquidity factor is too imprecise.The language in the final rule for the liquidity factor is consistent withestablished practice under 12 U.S.C. 191. <T3>See Smith, </T3>102 F.2d 638 (3d Cir. 1939); <T3>Franklin, </T3>381 F. Supp. 1390 (E.D.N.Y. 1974).<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), it is certifiedthat this amendment will not have a substantial economic impact on a significantnumber of small entities. As noted above, the OCC will make each determinationof insolvency on a case-by-case basis. Under the new regulations, suchdetermination will be based on a national bank's liquidity or equity position,not its size.
