Presser, 61, underwent surgery for brain cancer in May and wasentered Lakewood Hospital in this Cleveland suburb June 28 with ablood clot on the right lung.   Presser, who became president of the nation's largest union in1983 after his predecessor was convicted of fraud and bribery,faced federal charges of racketeering and embezzlement. His trial,however, was postponed indefinitely after he was diagnosed ashaving brain cancer.   ``Mr. Presser's condition had deteriorated significantly overthe last few hours and his cancer and previous cardiac conditioncontributed to his death,'' Dr. Robert W. Reynolds, head ofLakewood's cardiac care unit, said in a staement. Presser hadundergone open-heart surgery in 1985.   He had relinquished his powers as president of the 1.6million-member union for four months beginning May 4, and underwentsurgery for brain cancer May 17 at a clinic in Arizona.   The following month, Presser entered Lakewood Hospital the sameday as federal prosecutors in New York filed a massive civil suitseeking to take control of the union and break alleged Mafiadomination. Presser was one of the defendants in the suit.   In a lengthy report issued in 1986, the White House Commissionon Organized Crime concluded that Presser would not have becomeTeamsters president without the help of Anthony ``Fat Tony''Salerno, head of the New York-based Genovese crime family.   Presser always denied ties with the mob, and in May, Salerno wasacquitted on charges of rigging the elections of Presser and hispredecessor.   Rex Hardesty, spokesman for the AFL-CIO, said when notified ofPresser's death that the union had no immediate comment. TheTeamsters union rejoined the labor federation last year, threedecades after it was expelled because of the corruption charges.   Acting Teamsters president is Weldon L. Mathis, the union'ssecretary-treasurer.   Born Aug. 6, 1926, Presser was the son of William Faye ``BigBill'' Presser, a union organizer who eventually became presidentof the Ohio Conference of Teamsters and part of the entourage ofunion president Jimmy Hoffa.   Presser left school after the eighth grade, went to workdelivering juke boxes and pinball machines and joined the Navy atage 17.   His first union work was on the staff of Local 10 of the Hoteland Restaurant Employees Union in Cleveland, and he was electedpresident of the local in 1948. Later he went to work for hisfather as a Teamsters organizers.   In 1966, Presser formed Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland,organizing paint company workers and other non-trucking laborers,as well as some truckers, into a 6,000-member local, the biggestTeamsters unit in Cleveland.   Presser became vice president of the Ohio Conference ofTeamsters in the 1970s, and worked to improve the organization'simage through charitable activities and political work.   In 1976, Presser was elected to succeed his father as aninternational vice president. During the 1980 presidentialelection, Presser used his influence to gain a union endorsementfor Ronald Reagan, and was rewarded by being named labor cochairmanfor Reagan's inaugural.   He became president of the union in April 1983 when theexecutive committee named him to succeed Roy Williams, who had beenconvicted of conspiring to bribe a U.S. senator.   Two of Presser's three other predecessors also were convicted onlabor-corruption charges.   Dave Beck served 2{ years in prison for filing a false Teamsterstax return and for grand larceny, and the next president, Hoffa,went to prison for jury tampering and fraud. After his release fromprison, Hoffa disappeared in 1975 and is presumed to have beenmurdered.   Presser began his regime on a high note, ordering a strongpublic-relations campaign to counteract the effects of governmentinvestigations. Appearing before a Senate subcommittee in 1983,Presser asked ``for a chance to move this union in a progressivedirection'' and that he be judged on his actions.   He was plagued, however, by allegations of ties to organizedcrime and accusations by union dissidents that he was too quick togrant contract concessions.   In May 1986, Presser was charged with embezzlement andracketeering on allegations that he took $700,000 from hisCleveland local's office and paid it to ``ghost'' employees whoperformed no work.   Presser's attorney, John Climaco, claimed that Presser was anFBI informant who took part in the payroll-padding scheme to assistthe government's investigation of embezzlement and laborracketeering.   Two other officials in the Cleveland local, president HaroldFriedman and recording secretary Anthony Hughes, also were indictedon payroll-padding charges.   U.S. Attorney Patrick M. McLaughlin in Cleveland said the trialsof the other two are still scheduled to begin in U.S. DistrictCourt on Oct. 12.   ``I don't know that it would be appropriate at this point for meto comment on how this death will affect the prosecution of theother defendants,'' McLaughlin said Saturday.   Presser remained secretary-treasurer of Local 507 whileTeamsters president, drawing a reported $237,000 from the local andan estimated $600,000 a year from the international union.   His last major public appearance was in October 1987, whenPresser spoke to the AFL-CIO biennial convention. At that meeting,the Teamsters were welcomed back into the union umbrella groupafter 30 years of exile.   ``I take pride, and I am very pleased and proud, that I and myentire organization as well as my entire executive board are herein attendence at this convention for reaffiliation,'' Presser toldthe 700 delegates meeting at Miami Beach, Fla.</TEXT></DOC>
