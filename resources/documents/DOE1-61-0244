The displacement of the odd-spinlevels relative to their even-spin neighbors has been studied as a functionof the neutron number N for various isotopic chains, and as a functionof the nuclear spin I in each nucleus. Different behavior is observedin the vibrational and rotational limits. The observed simple systematicsin the deformed limit are used as a test for symmetry-conserving three-bodyinteractions in the SU(3) limit of the interacting boson model, withpositive results.</TEXT></DOC>
