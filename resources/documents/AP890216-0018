A consumer advocate complained, however, that for the cuts suchheavy-use periods as nights and weekends were insignificant.   The rate cut, which is subject to approval by the FederalCommunications Commission, would be the eighth price reduction sinceATandamp;T shed its local operating companies in 1984. Since that time,ATandamp;T long-distance rates have dropped more than 39 percent, thecompany said Wednesday.   The proposed rate reduction reflects lower costs for connectingto local telephone networks. Those costs will drop April 1 when thecharge residential and small business customers pay to maintainlocal phone network _ the so-called subscriber line charge _ rises30 cents per month to $3.50.   With customers paying more of the costs to maintain the localnetwork, long-distance companies have had to pay less. The FCC hasrequired ATandamp;T, the largest long-distance company and the only onesubject to federal rate regulation, to pass along these savings tocustomers by lowering rates.   But while most long-distance rates would go down under the newproposal, prices for basic long-distance calls under 292 miles wouldincrease an average of 4.7 percent _ a little less than a penny aminute. Such calls account for about one-third of ATandamp;T's interstatetraffic.   Also, daytime price cuts would be larger than evening price cuts,and night-weekend prices would not change.   Dave Thompson, a spokesman for the rival MCI CommunicationsCorp., said the company had not had a chance to study ATandamp;T'sproposal thoroughly, ``But, as usual, we plan to remain competitivewith ATandamp;T.''   Janis Langley, a spokeswoman at another competitor, US Sprint,said: ``In the past we have followed suit, and I anticipate that wewill do that in this issue also. Those reductions affect us in aslightly different way, but we will pass on whatever is appropriate(to our customers).''   Gene Kimmelman, legislative director for the Consumer Federationof America, complained that ATandamp;T was not cutting pricessignigicantly in the heavily used night and weekend long-distancetime periods.   ``It's unfair that consumers have to pay 30 cents more on theirlocal bill without receiving any rate reduction for thelong-distance service they use most,'' Kimmelman said in aninterview.   He said the price cut plan bodes ill for customers if ATandamp;T isgiven more flexibility to set prices, as has been proposed by FCCChairman Dennis R. Patrick.   ``If this is a sign of what ATandamp;T does when given pricingflexibility, it means that less regulation will deny consumers theprice reductions for evening, night and weekend services they'veexperienced in the last three or four years,'' Kimmelman said.   Under ATandamp;T's proposal:   _Basic long-distance service prices would drop an average 1.6percent. Day prices would decrease 3.8 percent, while evening priceswould decrease 0.4 percent.   _Rates for ATandamp;T WATS calls would drop an average 3.9 percent.   _PRO WATS rates would drop an average 3.8 percent.   _ATandamp;T MEGACOM WATS rates wouild drop 1.1 percent, and ATandamp;TMEGACOM 800 prices would be 5.2 percent lower.   _Basic ATandamp;T 800 service would drop 0.9 percent in price, while800 Readyline service would decrease 3.3 percent. Beginning July 1,ATandamp;T 800 service will be billed according to distance, and therewill be additional price reductions of 1.9 percent for 800 serviceand 2 percent for 800 Readyline.   _Software Defined Network Service prices will decline an average6.1 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
