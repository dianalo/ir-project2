The number of employees was not reported. Totalparticulate concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 21.7 milligrams per cubicmeter (mg/CuM), while the concentration of benzene-soluble materialsranged from 0.1 to 1.4mg/CuM. Total fluoride concentrations were 0.1to 0.9mg/CuM. Carbon monoxide concentrations ranged from below 50 partsper million, and sulfur dioxide was undetectable. The authors note thatcompliance with legal exposure standards should be used on samples collectedby the company and the government agency responsible for compliance enforcement.</TEXT></DOC>
