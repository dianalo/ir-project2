As the bull market grows older, they're hoping for good luck in picking stocks that will decline in 1987. They didn't have consistent success last year.    Short sellers' hit lists feature down-at-the-heels steel and semiconductor stocks; overpriced retailers and insurers; and Japanese exporters and high-fliers with fashionable businesses. &quot;Take the current fads and reverse them&quot; and you have some good shorts, recommends one money manager.    Besides Home Shopping Network, one of the shorts' disasters in early 1986, recent targets include Allegheny International and Limited. There are also some older favorites like General Motors Class E and Reebok International. There are also many small over-the-counter shorts like CopyTele, which aren't considered here.    Some money managers, however, warn against shorting institutional favorites like the Nifty 50, drug companies and Genentech. &quot;An expensive stock of a fine company&quot; might just become even more expensive, says one money manager.    Eventually, short sellers say, all stocks seek a level that's in keeping with their business prospects. Some stalwart shorts say they don't care whether the Dow Jones Industrial Average soars above 2000 or falls to 1500. But others are more inclined to short stocks -- and, indeed, the whole market -- as the bull market gets older. &quot;The smart money&quot; also has more incentive to go short now that all trading gains are taxed at the same rate, says Stanford Fingerhood of York Capital.    The Allegheny International soap opera, a drama of lavish spending and bad management, isn't over for short sellers. Since ousting its former chairman, Robert Buckley, the company has initiated reforms and is selling assets to reduce its heavy debts. But the liquidation plan was &quot;hastily put together,&quot; says one bear, and the asset sales may not bring in enough money to satisfy nervous creditors.    GM's alphabet stock was a popular short even before GM bought out Ross Perot's Electronic Data Systems stake. GME is still worth less than people think, says York Capital's Mr. Fingerhood. Generally, he says, shareholders can expect a 45% earnings payout when a growth company matures, but GME holders will be limited to a 25% payout even when EDS slows down. Because of that, he says, GME rates a much lower multiple than other companies growing at a similar rate.    Some shorts seem to like stocks that are already down. Elliot Eisenberg of R.D. Smith andamp; Co. is targeting Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, currently in bankruptcy-law proceedings. He predicts the steel company, like Manville, will be forced to issue more new shares than most people expect to refinance its debts. Speculators who recently have been buying the stock will be left out in the cold, he says.    In the troubled farm-implements business, even highly regarded Deere is on some shorts' list. Foreign competitors are encroaching on its turf, they note, and there's no sign of a pickup in its world-wide markets.    Some bears are almost ready to short Home Shopping Network again, after getting burned in 1986. While there's still some good news to come, Home Shopping's sales could slow now that Christmas is over, says one broker, and it could start feeling the heat of competition.    Reebok's fat profit margins eventually will melt in the flood of soft-leather shoes made by competitors, predicts William Fleckenstein of Fleckenstein Capital. Nike and L.A. Gear are good shorts, too, says Kurt Feshbach of Feshbach Brothers; he thinks trendsetters may soon return to wearing dressier shoes with their suits.    Japanese stocks widely regarded as overpriced proved dangerous shorts in 1986, but 1987 could be tougher for Japan and its exporters, money managers say. One bear thinks The Japan Fund is the ideal short. Michael Murphy's Overpriced Stock Service recommends shorting Matsushita Electric, NEC Corp., and Kyocera. Use stop-losses for protection against the &quot;tricky&quot; Japanese market, Mr. Murphy says.    Such semiconductor stocks as Texas Instruments, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel still look expensive, some bears say. U.S. chip makers are being battered by foreign competitors, and they aren't getting enough orders from computer, defense and electronics concerns. &quot;They keep talking of a turnaround,&quot; says one bear, but some of them just &quot;turn around and lose money.&quot;    Short sellers think analysts' bullish estimates for chip makers' earnings will keep falling, putting more pressure on the stocks. In November, 1986 and 1987 estimates for chipmakers fell 27% and 5%, respectively, according to Institutional Brokers Estimate System.    With consumers neck-deep in debt, some shorts are targeting popular clothing retailers with lofty price/earnings multiples, such as Dress Barn, Charming Shoppes and even Limited. Limited's tiny dividend won't support the stock, says one bear, and &quot;Wall Street will be merciless&quot; if its &quot;great growth rate&quot; starts to stall. The same goes for Wal-Mart Stores, some bears say.    Other popular cyclical stocks are getting consideration from short sellers. They think property-casualty stocks such as American International Group and General Re have a lot further to fall if it turns out their earnings are peaking. Digital Equipment is still close to its highs but bears watching, says one technology buff. Trees, he says, don't grow to the sky. </TEXT></DOC>
