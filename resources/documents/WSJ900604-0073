The company said the tests, approved by the U.S.Department of Agriculture, are scheduled to begin next weeknear Lisbon, Iowa, at its cornbreeding station.</LP><TEXT>   BioTechnica disclosed that its corn plants have beenmodified to contain &quot;marker&quot; genes that enable scientists totrack the inheritance of artificially introduced genes ingenetically engineered plants. In January, the company saidit was the first to incorporate foreign genes successfully incorn plants. Corn is one of several major grain crops inwhich inserting new genes has proved difficult. ButBioTechnica hadn't previously disclosed what kind of gene wasinvolved.   A marker gene has little economic importance and isinserted to enable scientists to determine whether foreigngenes have been incorporated and are inherited in a plant. Atypical marker gene would confer resistance to a certainherbicide; plants incorporating it are identified by theirsurvival when exposed to the herbicide. BioTechnica declinedto identify the marker gene used. In April, DeKalb GeneticsCorp. and a joint USDA-Monsanto Co. team separately said theyalso had inserted marker genes in corn.   BioTechnica also disclosed that it is trying to engineercorn genetically to produce high levels of the amino acidlysine, a building block of protein.   And the company said it is developing corn, soybean,alfalfa and wheat plants that have been genetically alteredfor improvements, such as increased insect resistance, yieldor nutrition.</TEXT></DOC>
