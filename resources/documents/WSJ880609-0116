The Transportation Department gave Federal Express until June 17 to start the service. The agency said that U.S. and Japanese officials could begin negotiations as early as tomorrow.    Under terms of the government award of the route, Federal Express was to begin the service June 1. Initially, the company had planned to start the service May 12, but it postponed the inaugural flight at the last minute, contending that the Japanese government had imposed unexpected restrictions. Competitors of Federal Express assert that the company understood the restrictions from the beginning and has been holding out for terms that would make the route more valuable.    &quot;We're extremely disappointed by this decision,&quot; said an official of DHL Airways, a privately held Redwood City, Calif., concern that had entered a bid to operate the route through a joint venture with United Parcel Service Inc.    &quot;We would be extremely disturbed if the private discussions between Federal Express and senior officials of the U.S. and Japanese governments are for the purpose of enhancing the value of the route by changing the rules. We continue to demand that if the route is substantially enhanced, bidding for it should be reopened to all carriers.&quot;    A Federal Express official said that &quot;based on our current understanding of the situation, we are preparing to commence {Tokyo} service by June 17.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
