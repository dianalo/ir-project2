<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-57-1093 </DOCNO><TEXT>Transient studies on the oxidation of CO have been performed over Pd/SiO{sub2} and Pt/SiO{sub 2} catalysts using a rapid scan FTIR coupled to a quadrupolemass spectrometer. When a 5% CO(He) mixture was replaced by 5% O{sub2}(He) at 80{sup 0}C, an induction period of about 110 s was observedbefore the oxidation reaction was initiated. The length of this inductionperiod was observed to decrease sharply with increasing temperature.When a 5% O{sub 2}(He) mixture was replaced by 5% CO(He), the inductionperiods were almost zero and independent of temperature. The data areexplained in terms of a CO-O{sub 2} reaction model consisting of CO islandswith highly reactive boundaries. The reaction occurs preferentially atthe periphery of these islands of reactivity. 28 references.</TEXT></DOC>
