(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fawn Hall fended off a lawyer's questionsfor two hours Saturday as part of a lawsuit in which a liberalpolicy group has charged that several Iran-Contra figures wereinvolved in drug dealing.   In a testy session, the former secretary to fired NationalSecurity Council aide Oliver North delivered a deposition in whichshe denied knowing several people involved in the suit. She wasaccompanied by her lawyer, Plato Cacheris.   Ms. Hall, who is not a defendant in the case, also deniedknowing about or said she had forgotten details of several meetingsand documents on which she was questioned.   At one point, when lawyer Philip Hirschkop asked her about notesNorth took after meetings, she snapped, ``I don't sit around andwatch my boss.''   The session, held in Hirschkop's office in a suburb ofWashington, D.C., was open to the public.   The civil lawsuit was filed two years ago by the ChristicInstitute, which is based in Washington, D.C.   The institute is representing two American journalists _ MarthaHoney and Tony Avirgan _ who are seeking $22 million for injuriesAvirgan suffered when a bomb exploded at a May 1986 news conferenceheld in Nicaragua by former Contra leader Eden Pastora. Threereporters were killed in the blast.   The suit accuses 29 defendants of a series of conspiracies,including plans to provide weapons to the Contra rebels inNicaragua, smuggle cocaine into the United States to finance Contraoperations, and assassinate a U.S. ambassador in Costa Rica tocollect a bounty.   The defendants include Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim,businessmen who have also face criminal charges of theft andconspiracy in the Iran-Contra affair.   Thomas Green, attorney for Secord and Hakim, attended thedeposition.   The trial in the Christic suit is scheduled to begin June 26 inMiami.</TEXT></DOC>
