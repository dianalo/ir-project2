 The VedeoShow system could create anon-screen slide show from a set of graphic images.andP;  In 1984 the hardwarerepresented a vast improvement on the thenstandard CGA monitor's resolutionof 320 by 200 pixels with eight colors--the VideoShow monitor offered 2,000by 500 pixels and could create 1,000 simultaneous colors by using &quot;dithering&quot;techniques to mix colored dots.andM;The latest VideoShow incarnations--VideoShow Executive Model 160 ($3,995),Professional Model 180 ($8,995), and others--still produce extremely vividslide shows with more colors and greater resolution than most monitors andgraphics software.andP;  But one of the reasons that on-screen slide shows havebecome increasingly popular in the last few years is that more-capablemonitors and graphics software have all but elimanated the need forspecialized hardware.andM;In addition, many leading business-graphics packages, including applause II,Micrografx Graph Plus, Harvard Graphics, Lotus Freelance Plus, and CA-CricketPresents (formerly Xerox Presents), now offer screen-show capabilities.andP;  Youcan even produce a screen show with 1-2-3 or Symphony (see the box on thenext page).andM;Low Overhead, High PortabilityandM;In an on-screen slide show, a series of graphics files are connected withtransitional effects that govern the way each image replaces the last.andP;  Adisk-based screen show has several advantages over a conventional slidepresentation--mainly greater portability and lower cost.andP;  A screen is asportable as a floppy disk and can be set up to run unsupervised at a tradeshow or in a dealer's showroom.andP;  some screen-software lets you put togetherinteractive shows that proceed from image to image based in the viewer'sactions.andM;Screen shows are best suited for informal presentations to small groups andfor presentations that must be updated frequently.andP;  A screen show isinexpensive to produce and can be updated quickly and easily compared to thecost and labor involved in preparing overhead transparencies or slides.andO;However, only a handful of people can gather around a typical computermonitor.andP;  For a large audience, you need special equipment, such as anoversize monitor or large-screen projector, which defeats an on-screen slideshow's cost and portability advantages.andM;If you plan to take your show on the road or distribute copies of it, use apackage that lets you create a run-time version.andP;  This feature lets you run ascreen show on machines without the originating software.andP;  At the moment onlyFreelance Plus supplies a utility for creating a run-time version that runsdirectly from DOS.andP;  Software Publishing Corp. offers a DOS-based run-timeutility for Harvard Graphics, but it's a $149 option.andP;  Graph Plus, which runsunder Microsoft Windows, comes with a run-time utility and a run-time versionof Windows for 80286-based computers that have enough memory.andM;Putting It All TogetherandM;Creating a screen show begins with the relatively simple task of entering aseries of graphics files and arranging them in the proper sequence.andP;  Filesfrom a variety of different software packages, including 1-2-3 and FreelancePlus, can be blended into one show.andP;  At this point most slide-show programsuse the file names, not the images themselves, on-screen.andP;  CA-CricketPresents, however, lets you see thumbnail sketches as you lay out the show, abit like viewing slides on a light table.andM;After listing the files, you must define the transitions between them--theway each image replaces the previous one.andP;  Defining a transition includesseveral steps--specifying the type of effect, the direction from which itcomes, and the speed with which it happens.andP;  In a wipe effect, for example,the new image appears to slide right over the previous one, like a slidingdoor.andP;  In a fade effect, the pixels of the new image randomly replace thoseof the previous image.andM;Other transition effects include scrolls, where the new image appears to pushthe previous image off the screen; weaves, where alternate lines of the newimage converge from opposite sides; venetian blinds, where the new image iscreated in strips; and drips, where the new image takes shape as if it werepoured out of a paint can.andP;  You can also overlay images, combining several tocreate a complete picture.andM;The transition choices may seem a bit over-whelming at first if you're notaccustomed to audiovisual production.andP;  After you get the hang of it, it'seasy to experiment with different effects and different speeds because theresult is immediately visible on the screen.andP;  Deciding whether to use ascroll or a fade or whether to wipe an image from the bottom or the top canmake you feel like a movie director, but try to restrain your cinematicimpulses.andP;  Remember that you are trying to communicate a message--notrecreate Star Wars.andM;You also need to specify the time that each image remains on the screen.andO;Images can automatically advance at a preset time interval, or they canadvance in response to keystroke.andP;  If you intend to present screen showsregularly, consider an infrared redote control, such as SilentPartner fromPresentation Electronics ($349), which lets you control the show from acrossthe room.andM;For the maximum in creative options, check out a stand-alone screen-showpackage, such as IBM's Storyboard Plus or Brightbill-Roberts andamp; Co.'s ShowPartner F/X.andP;  The screen-show technology in both Freelance Plus and ApplauseII comes from Brightbill-Roberts and represents just a subset of the featuresin Show Partner F/X.andP;  The stand-alone products generally you to edit bothgraphics and fonts, create true animation effects, and develop interactivescreen shows that branch, depending on the viewer's actions.andM;A SCREEN SHOW IN 1-2-3 AND SYMPHONYandM;You can create a macro-controlled, on-screen slide show with any release of1-2-3 or symphony.andP;  The tecniques are different--1-2-3 Release 2.2 and 3 usethe {GRAPHON} command, while Symphony uses a special window--but you cancreate a show that advances from screen to screen at predetermined intervalsor in response to a keystroke.andM;The {GRAPHON} COMMAND WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN 1-2-3 PRIOR TO Releases 2.2 and 3.andO;You can create a slide show in earlier releases, but the images will advanceonly when someone presses a key.andP;  In general, screen show produced in allreleases of 1-2-3 and Symphony lack the vivid colors, graphics options, andtransitional effects available with Lotus Freelance Plus and otherpresenttion-graphics packages.andM;In 1-2-3 Releases 2.2 and 3, begin by creating the graphs you want and thenuse the Graph Name Create command to identify and store each graph's settingsin the worksheet.andP;  Suppose, for example, that you've created a bar graphshowing sales in the first quarter.andP;  With 1-2-3 in READY mode, press slash,select Graph Name Create, and enter q1sales.andP;  To create a graph for thesecond-quarter sales, change the relevant settings to reflect the correctdata (data ranges, titles, and so on), then select Name Create and enterq2sales.andP;  Repeat this process for third-and fourth-quarter sales, q3sales andq4sales, then create a view of the yearly average, called average.andP;  Finally,be sure to save the worksheet file after naming the last graph or you'll losethe graph settings.andM;Now create the macro by using the figure below as a guide.andP;  Begin with thecommand {GRAPHON q1sales}.andP;  To control how long the graph remains on thescreen, use the following command, where minutes and seconds are the numberof minutes and seconds you want the graph to remain on-screen:andM;{WAIT @NOW+@TIME(0,minutes,seconds)}andM;To keep the graph on-screen until someone presses a key, assign a name to anunused cell and replae the {WAIT} command with {GET cellname}.andP;  This macrouses both techniques.andP;  It displays the q1sales, q2sales, and q3sales graphsfor five seconds each.andP;  Then it displays the graph named q4sales and waitsfor someone to press a key.andP;  Once a key is pressed, the macro displays thegraph named average, waits for another keystroke, then terminates and returns1-2-3 to READY mode.andM;The next macro, for 1-2-3 Release 2/2.01, displays the same five graphs.andO;This macro presses slash, selects Grpah Name Use, and enters a graph name.andO;The last command, Q, quits the graph menu and returns 1-2-3 to READY mode.andM;Dont try to use the {BRANCH} command to create a self-repeating show; you mayhave trouble stopping it with the usual technique of holding down the Controlkey and pressing Break.andP;  In 1-2-3 Release 2/2.01, the macro will probablytreat the Control-Break key combination as it would any other keystroke anddisplay the next graph rather than terminate.andM;In Symphony the trick is to set up a window devoted to graphs.andP;  Once you'vecreated and named all the graphs for the show, create a window named GRAPH.andM;The Symphony macro below begins with {PANELOFF}{WINDOWSOFF}, selects SERVICESWindow Use, and specifies the window named GRAPH.andP;  Then it uses the MENUAttach command to make q1sales the current graph.andP;  After that, the screenshow behaves just like the one for 1-2-3 Releases 2.2 and 3.andM;William G.
