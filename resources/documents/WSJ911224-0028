The Pennzoil project is significant because it is expectedto produce oil much faster than many of the other existingventures by U.S. oil companies in what was once the SovietUnion. Industry giants, including Exxon Corp., Mobil Corp.and Chevron Corp., have made proposals for joint ventures.But most of their plans are stalled in the shiftingbureaucracy and are years away from the actual drilling andselling of any crude.</LP><TEXT>   Pennzoil may be the first U.S. company to hammer out anoil development arrangement in the new Commonwealth ofIndependent States. Eleven republics of the former SovietUnion signed on as co-founders of the commonwealth over theweekend.   The demise of the Soviet Union could enable othercompanies to move toward oil arrangements with quickerpaybacks. &quot;The death of the Soviet Union may acceleratethis,&quot; said Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge EnergyResearch Associates, a consulting firm in Massachusetts. &quot;Theruble has no value,&quot; and the only hard currency Russia has isoil, he said.   While the scale of Pennzoil's project is relatively smallby Big Oil standards, it is noteworthy for the company, whichis trying to revive its stagnating oil and gas explorationand production business. Just two weeks ago, Pennzoil said itwould make overseas activity its primary oil focus after acentury almost exclusively devoted to domestic business. Tothat end, the company brought in four men with internationalexperience to head up its oil operations.   In Russia, Pennzoil plans to develop the West Mogotlorskfield, discovered in 1986 and located in the Tyumen region ofWestern Siberia. &quot;The project is strategically located in theheart of one of the most prolific oil-producing regions inthe country,&quot; said James L. Pate, Pennzoil's chief executiveofficer. &quot;Development drilling is expected to begin within afew weeks.&quot;   Pennzoil said it would drill about 50 wells to develop thefield and estimates there are at least 40 million barrels ofrecoverable reserves. The company said the field has largenatural gas reserves, too. Initially the gas will bereinjected back into the ground to force out more oil. Whenthe oil is depleted the gas will be produced and sold.   Pennzoil wouldn't disclose production estimates, butindustry sources estimate that output from the field willpeak at about 25,000 barrels a day. Pennzoil said it willreceive 25% of the crude. With that potential addition of6,250 barrels a day, Pennzoil's daily oil production wouldjump 21% to 36,150 barrels from the 1990 average of 29,900barrels daily.   Pennzoil is participating in the field through a venturecalled Siberian American Oil Co., which is made up ofPennzoil, other U.S. companies and private investors. TheRussian partner in the enterprise is Agansk GeologicalEnterprise, based in the Siberian town of Novoagansk.   An oil pipeline that connects to the Trans-Siberianpipeline is located less than one mile from the WestMogotlorsk field. Pennzoil said the oil will be transportedthrough the pipeline system and exported for hard currencyfrom ports on either the Baltic or Black seas.</TEXT></DOC>
