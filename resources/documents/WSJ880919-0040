Agency officials said the proposed venture may substantially reduce competition in the production and sale of equipment used to level and align railroad tracks. The officials said that Montreal-based Ivaco's Canron Inc. unit is the leading supplier of such equipment in the U.S., while Jackson Jordan, based in Schaumburg, Ill., is the third largest. The Justice Department said the proposed joint venture would control more than 70% of the domestic market for so-called automatic tampers, and railroad companies could face higher prices in obtaining the machinery. </TEXT></DOC>
