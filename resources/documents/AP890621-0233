The 1988 U.S. Trade Act could have the greatest short-termadverse impact on the world trading system, the secretariat of the96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said Tuesday in asix-month review.   The so-called Section 301 of the U.S. law could lead to movesaimed at pressuring countries into bilateral trade accords outsideGATT's international trade rules, the review said.   The United States last month singled out Japan, India and Brazilfor priority action under the law that calls for penalties againstcountries deemed to be especially protectionist.   Brazil and India will raise the issue at the two-day councilmeeting beginning Wednesday, which is part of the latest four-yearGATT talks known as the Uruguay Round, a GATT source said oncondition of anonymity.   The review said although much progress had been made in theUruguay Round, there had been ``a further increase in theuncertainties and tensions affecting trade policies'' in the periodreviewed, the six months until last February.</TEXT></DOC>
