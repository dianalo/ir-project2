Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., following 7-6approval at a hectic session ending with a gun lobbyist complainingabout a senator's decision not to vote.   The measure would ban nine varieties of semiautomatic assaultweapons, five already covered by the Bush administration's importban and four others produced domestically.   The bill also would provide for up to 10 years of additionalprison time for those convicted of crimes involving firearms. Themeasure would automatically go off the books in three years under a``sunset'' provision.   Critics of the measure called it too restrictive, although itwas modest in comparison with a flurry of bills that went into thehopper in February following a mass slaying in a Californiaschoolyard with a semi-automatic assault rifle.   ``I think it does a great deal of damage to the right of thepeople to keep and bear arms,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told thecommittee. Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said the bill headedin the right direction but should be stronger in banning assaultweapons.   ``Frankly it is a letdown to the law enforcement groups inAmerica,'' Metzenbaum said.   At the start of the meeting, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., told thecommittee he would not be able to attend because he was tied downwith evidence hearings in the impeachment trial of U.S. DistrictJudge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami, accused of plotting to obtain a$150,000 bribe. He then left.   When it came time to vote an hour later, however, there was aquestion as to whether the committee should wait for Specter. TheHastings hearing was taking place in a room about a three-minutewalk away.   ``The problem is he's on the Hastings matter and I know he takesthat very, very seriously,'' Hatch said.   Because of the razor-thin margin, senators held open the rollcall for 10 minutes or more in case Specter might want to vote. Aminute after the vote was announced, the Pennsylvania senatorarrived but told Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del.,he would need time to study any changes made in the legislation.   Biden banged the gavel and adjourned the meeting. The chairmanand Specter were both quickly out the door, but Sen. CharlesGrassley, R-Iowa, told reporters that ``as a matter of courtesythey could have given him five or six minutes to study the bill.''   National Rifle Association lobbyist Wayne LaPierre, however,told reporters he had been with Specter ``at the Hastings hearing,in the back of the room,'' urging him to come to the JudiciaryCommittee meeting to vote against DeConcini's bill.   ``Basically,'' LaPierre said, ``Specter just decided to beabsent.''   The lobbyist said he still expected the Pennsylvania senator tobe on the side of gunowner groups when the measure comes to thefloor.   Earlier, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and Republican followerssought to substitute the Bush administration's omnibus crimecontrol bill for the gun measure, but that effort failed 8-5.   Thurmond warned that strong anticrime measures are needed andcited the case of a South Carolina man convicted of murder a decadeago. ``He hasn't been electrocuted yet,'' Thurmond said. ``Peopleare are losing respect for criminal justice procedures.''   Biden said crime-control measures are needed but not beforePresident Bush implements broad powers granted him in last year'sdrug bill. He said the administration has been authorized to hire225 new FBI agents but has not done so.   ``I don't doubt the president's sincerity,'' Biden said. ``Ijust don't think he's tough enough.''</TEXT></DOC>
