The meeting Monday in the Oval Office drew together Bush, drugczar William Bennett, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady and Stephen Higgins, director ofTreasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.   ``They were bringing to the president their insights, theircollective review,'' said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen. ``Thesubject of semiautomatic weapons came up, but no conclusions weremade. They don't feel their review has been completed.''   Bush, who proudly notes in speeches his longtime membership inthe National Rifle Association, has been moving away from the NRA'shard-line position that citizens have the right to keep and bearvirtually any kind of weapon.   The apparent change of heart was prompted by widespread callsfrom police organizations nationwide as well as from the public fora ban on the weapons. The calls were prompted by scores ofdrug-related shootings and the January slayings of five children ata Stockton, Calif., school by a man armed with an AK-47.   Brady two weeks ago suspended imports of hundreds of thousandsof the weapons, including semiautomatic versions of the AK-47 andUzi carbines, pending a review of their use to determine if theymeet the legal requirement that they are intended for such sportingpurposes as hunting and target shooting.   The ATF has estimated the review may take three to four months.   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the meetingthe first session ``of the principals since this review has begun''and said that no decisions had been expected to emerge from it.   An official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said thatamong the items discussed at the meeting was legislation sponsoredby Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, to require those wishing to ownsemiautomatic rifles to undergo FBI checks, be fingerprinted, andpay a $200 fee to the government.   Also discussed were ways of strengthening the 2-week-old ban onimportation of semiautomatic firearms, the official said.   Bush called last week for a compromise on the issue of privateownership of the high load capacity, rapid-fire weapons because``we're in a very different time now.''   ``I believe we can find an accommodation between the legitimateinterest of sportsmen and the interests of police chiefs, whose menput their lives on the line every day,'' Bush told a group of statelegislators.   Semiautomatic rifles fire one shot each time the trigger ispulled, unlike automatic rifles, which unleash a stream of bulletswith each trigger pull. In non-semiautomatic rifles, each roundmust be chambered with a separate manual action.   The suspension being imposed by ATF ultimately could affectclose to a half-million semiautomatic rifles.   Initially, ATF suspended imports of more than 113,000 of theres in five categories _ AKS-type firearms such as AK-47s, Uzicarbines, FN-FAL- and FN-FNC-type weapons as well as Steyr Augrifles. Those weapons had import ermits pending with ATF but hadnot yet been apter, the ATF expanded the suspension to weapons for whichimport permits had been approved but which had not yet come intothe country.   The expanded suspension could affect as many as 400,000additional weapons, ATF spokesman Dick Pedersen estimated.   Dot Koester, an ATF spokeswoman, said a gun importer must applyto the ATF for permission to import a certain number of weapons,and the permits, once approved, are gd for six months, she said.   ``Often what haens is that he will ask for approval inbringin0,000, then he will bring in 1,000 or 5,000 or nMs. Koester said.   ``A number of permits had been approved prior to the suspensionof the five groups of weapons'' two weeks ago, but the guns had notyet gotten through Customs and into the U.S. marketplace, she said.   Blocking the importation ose weapons which already hadapproved import pwas always intended to be part of theprocess,'' she said.   Among the options facing the administration are ending thesuspension and allowing the weapons to begin floodig the countryagain, or making the suspension permanent.   In addition, officials could call on U.S. manufacturersunaffected by the suspension to follow the lead of Colt Industries,which announced a dfter the suspension was imposed two weeksago that it would temily halt sales of its AR-15 semiautomaticrifle. The AR-15 is considered one of the most populasemiautomatic riflesand it is the U.S.-made weapon most similar tothe foreign-made guns being kept out of the country.</TEXT></DOC>
