In another development, the most senior Shiite Moslem cleric inLebanon blamed the United States and Israel for Parliament'sfailure to elect a new president and said it will ``explode intheir face.''   Guerrillas of George Habash's Marxist Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine fought Syrian-backed fighters of Col. SaeedMousa's Fatah-Uprising for five hours.   A police spokesman said the clash at the Bourj el-Barajnehrefugee camp stopped after neutral guerrilla groups called acease-fire.   ``Police patrols couldn't enter the camp to launch aninvestigation,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   He said the casualties were evacuated to hospitals in westBeirut.   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine operates underthe umbrella of Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.   Mousa broke away from the PLO in 1983 and establishedheadquarters in Damascus, the Syrian capital.   Guerrillas of Arafat's mainline Fatah group evacuated Bourjel-Barajneh, their last foothold in Beirut, on July 8 after thecamp fell to Mousa's followers.   The Shiite leader, Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin, said said an``American-Israeli plot'' was behind Parliament's failure on Aug.18 to muster a quorum of 51 members to elect a new president.   ``If the Americans want to continue with their dangerous game,then a force stronger than what they have known will explode intheir face,'' he said.   The only serious candidate was Syrian-backed warlord SuleimanFranjieh, 78. According to Lebanon's Constitution, a new head ofstate should be elected before Sept. 23, when the six-year term ofPresident Amin Gemayel expires.   Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite, adjourned theabortive election session without setting a date for a new meetingto elect a president.   Syrian-backed leftist and Moslem factions have accused theUnited States and the right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces militia,which is sympathatic to Israel, of blocking Franjieh's election.   Franjieh's backers have also accused the Lebanese Forces offorcefully preventing deputies from attending the parliamentarysession to block the election of Franjieh, a personal friend ofSyrian President Hafez Assad.   The Christian militia has denied the charge and said theboycotters opposed Franjieh's election. But a Lebanese Forcesspokesman, speaking privately, said Parliament will have ``noquorum as long as Franjieh remains a candidate.''   U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley has blamedParliament's failure to elect a new president on the lack of a``consensus candidate.''   Shamseddin, addressing a news conference at his residence inMoslem west Beirut, said the United States ``wants to end Syria'sregional (Middle Eastern) role to give Israel a free hand inLebanon.''   ``We are determined not to succumb to the American stand,'' saidShamseddin, who heads the Supreme Shiite Islamic Council in Lebanon.   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000 troopsin eastern and northern provinces and in west and south Beirut.</TEXT></DOC>
