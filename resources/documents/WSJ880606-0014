John Kgori, who is spending the night at the farmhouse, doesn't even stir to see who it is. Instead, he finishes his dinner and lights a cigarette. &quot;It's the police,&quot; he says calmly. &quot;I've been expecting them.&quot;    The headlights shine through the picture window of the living room as 10 policemen from the black homeland of Bophuthatswana, some armed with automatic rifles, surround the house. Two of them enter, saying they have a few questions for Mr. Kgori. He offers them tea. They would rather he come down to the station, 30 minutes away.    Why is he in Bophuthatswana? the police want to know. What business does he have with Mr. Segopolo, an opponent of the homeland government? Why is he traveling with a &quot;certain white man,&quot; a journalist also being detained? They search his briefcase, thumb through his notes and his books. After more than two hours, they say he can go. No charges are filed, no explanations offered.    &quot;It's simply harassment. They just wanted to waste my time,&quot; Mr. Kgori says on the way back to the farmhouse. He sighs, more out of boredom than relief. A couple of months ago, he was detained by the same policemen at the same station. &quot;It's part of my job.&quot;    Mr. Kgori, a 32-year-old former teacher, is one of about two dozen field workers in the justice and reconciliation division of the South African Council of Churches, which zealously opposes the government and apartheid, its system of racial segregation. Under the state of emergency, which is expected to be extended later this week for a third year, countless black activists have been jailed or forced underground. But SACC field workers still operate above ground, out in the open, where their efforts to monitor and alleviate the repressive conditions in the country's black townships bring them into constant conflict with the authorities.    Mr. Kgori and other field workers walk the fine line between social work, which is grudgingly tolerated by the government, and activism, which isn't. They check up on detainees and care for their families. They help to ease former detainees back into society. They solicit legal aid to fend off the latest threats of repression. They struggle to hold black communities together when the authorities seek to divide them. They try to feed the hungry and house the homeless. They are forever caught between an interrogation room and a prison cell.    &quot;If we give food to the poor, we are called saints. If we ask why there is no food, we are called Communists,&quot; Mr. Kgori says with a sad laugh.    A small, thin man with a deep reserve of energy, Mr. Kgori covers the vast expanse of western Transvaal Province and northern Cape Province. All the turmoil and suffering of black South Africa are found here: boycotts and unrest in the urban townships, hunger and homelessness in the rural ones; labor problems in the gold mines, exploitation on the farms. The pro-apartheid Conservative Party is strong here, and the white-supremacist Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging sows hate and racism like wheat and corn.    To spend a couple of days with Mr. Kgori as he makes his rounds is to travel on the edge of the state of emergency. At every stop, Mr. Kgori sees the fear and frustration of his people-and enough determination and defiance to keep going. And where he goes, the police follow.    Potchefstroom   The regional office of the South African Council of Churches here is squeezed between a vegetable shop and a dry cleaner in a shopping center on the edge of Potchefstroom's black township. SACC workers suspect that the police use the dry cleaner as a listening post; several of its customers wear uniforms.    This day begins, as does every day, with a short worship service. The Rev. Harold Brooks, a Methodist minister who heads the office, reads from Psalm 82: &quot;Defend the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and needy.&quot; The SACC staffers rise to sing, &quot;Who will save our land and people. Who can rescue us from wrong.&quot;    Though it is not yet 9 a.m., dozens of youngsters are milling around the SACC offices. They are former detainees who aren't allowed back into school because the authorities say they are troublemakers. The older ones, 18 to 20 years old, attend SACC-supervised correspondence classes. But there are no courses for the younger ones, such as 16-year-old April Mohau, who has been detained several times since the state of emergency was declared in June 1986, and his 14-year-old friend Samuel, who has been detained once. They haven't attended school for two years.    &quot;We just want to get them off the streets, away from the authorities,&quot; Mr. Kgori says. &quot;Any time there are problems in the township, they come looking for these young ones. When they are here with us, at least we know what's happening to them.&quot;    En Route to Klerksdorp   Winter is coming to South Africa, and western Transvaal, fresh and alive during the summer, is turning dry and dormant. Mr. Kgori worries that the area's black residents, usually full of fight, are also entering the winter of their struggle against the government.    &quot;Resistance is weak in the western Transvaal,&quot; he says. &quot;Since the state of emergency, people are afraid of this government. They are afraid to make their voices heard for their rights. Their leaders are in jail or underground, and they don't know who to turn to.&quot;    The day before, Mr. Kgori met with some teachers complaining about their treatment at the government-run schools. Some say their paychecks are often delayed; others say teachers are being transferred to little farm schools against their will. They don't know how to respond; troublemakers -- students or teachers -- aren't welcome in state schools.    &quot;We're trying to get them organized, but they are afraid to stand up out here,&quot; Mr. Kgori says. &quot;They stand up at national conferences when it is safe to stand up. But when they come home, they are afraid to speak out.&quot;    Klerksdorp   Mr. Kgori arrives at a small concrete house in the black township of Jouberton, just outside the white town of Klerksdorp. A young man named Sidney emerges from the underground to meet him. &quot;Things are very difficult here now,&quot; says Sidney, one of the &quot;comrades,&quot; the militant youths who called the shots in the township during the unrest of the mid-'80s.    The local authorities, he explains, are trying to break a township-wide rent boycott, which began in 1986. Earlier in the week, 10 people were evicted from their homes, and many others have received eviction notices. Sidney fears that the boycott, and the unity of the community, will crumble under these threats.    &quot;Yesterday, I arranged for those just evicted to meet with a lawyer. But none of them showed up,&quot; he says. &quot;The problem is within our own people. They don't want us to get involved. They worry, `Here come the comrades again.'&quot;    Mr. Kgori listens closely, taking a few notes. &quot;When people need help, they get scared,&quot; he says. &quot;The government has established a bad picture of some organizations {like the comrades}, so people think that if they deal with these organizations, they will be worse off. They have turned us against ourselves.&quot;    He says he will contact lawyers to begin a test case against the evictions. And he promises to return on Sunday to speak during church services. &quot;The people must know we are doing God's work, not politics, in opposing the evictions. The SACC believes it is a right of people to be housed, not a privilege,&quot; he says. &quot;The community needs unity on this issue. We can't let the state divide us.&quot;    On Road to Vryburg   Mr. Kgori's earliest memory of apartheid goes back to 1959, when he was only three years old. He remembers his family hurriedly packing up all their belongings and hauling them to a new house in Potchefstroom. Their old house, and the entire township, was being demolished because it was too close to the white area of town.    &quot;I couldn't understand why we had to move,&quot; he says, laughing at his innocence of long ago.    As he grew, so did his understanding -- and anger. In 1974, as a student in Soweto, the black township outside Johannesburg, he joined classmates in burning a textbook called &quot;Die man van Blydskap.&quot; &quot;It made a mockery of black people,&quot; he recalls.    When the Soweto student riots erupted on June 16, 1976, following a government attempt to make Afrikaans the language of the state schools, Mr. Kgori was in the middle of the action. He was detained on June 23, and for two weeks he was regularly assaulted by South African police.    &quot;Whenever I called them meneer {mister}, they beat me until I called them baas {boss},&quot; he says. &quot;They kept saying, 'You call us baas.'&quot; He was released in January 1977 without being charged.    He was detained again on July 1, 1986, at the outset of the state of emergency. He was teaching history at a state school in Potchefstroom, where he was also involved with the politically active Civic Association and the National Education Crisis Committee. This time, there were no beatings, just days and days of intense questioning.    &quot;When I was released eight months later, I knew I could never work for Afrikaners again,&quot; he says. &quot;I loved teaching, but I felt I had to quit. I had to get out of the system.&quot;    Now, as he enters the town of Schweizer-Reneke, a Conservative Party stronghold, he feels trapped in the system again. At Wally's Cafe, the white woman behind the counter makes it clear from her expression that Mr. Kgori may order a sandwich but must eat it outside.    The sign above the door says Right of Admission Reserved. &quot;That means blacks aren't welcome,&quot; he says, finishing his lunch in the car. &quot;It's too bad about these whites. They just aren't ready for reconciliation yet.&quot;    Vryburg   The Rev. Abiel Moleleki, a Methodist minister in the small township of Huhudi near Vryburg, eagerly ushers Mr. Kgori into his little office. &quot;Everything is quiet,&quot; he says. &quot;The leaders are still in detention, and people are waiting and watching to see which way the wind will blow next.&quot;    At the moment, there is barely a breeze ruffling Huhudi. Before the emergency, community leaders affiliated with the national United Democratic Front were agitating for improvements in living conditions: The dirt streets are almost impassable, the shacks that pass for houses are falling apart, the people are still waiting for flush toilets. The state of emergency clamped down on the UDF, and now the black town councilors working within the system are keeping the lid on tight.    &quot;They say my church is a UDF church,&quot; Mr. Moleleki moans. &quot;The councilors won't let us do anything.&quot;    Last year, Mr. Moleleki received about $20,000 from the Kagiso Trust (which is financed primarily by overseas groups) to build a brick-making factory. To this day, the council still hasn't approved a site. &quot;I've had visits from the police asking where the money is coming from,&quot; he says. &quot;Their fear is that I will build an office or a house for the African National Congress.&quot; He laughs. &quot;I was warned,&quot; he says, &quot;that we are still living under the state of emergency. As if I didn't know.&quot;    All he wants to do, he says, is make bricks so people can build their own houses. &quot;But the council doesn't want us doing anything,&quot; he says.    On Way to Geysdorp   The paved highway abruptly turns into a dirt road, and South Africa, without warning, dissolves into Bophuthatswana. The homeland has been granted independence by Pretoria, but no other country recognizes it. Neither does the SACC.    &quot;We're as popular here as we are in South Africa,&quot; Mr. Kgori says sarcastically. He still bears the scar from the time a Bophuthatswana soldier hit him above the eye with a rifle butt.    To the South African government and the homelands, the SACC runs a close second to the banned African National Congress as Public Enemy No. 1. SACC offices around the country are constantly under surveillance and are routinely raided. The ministers who head the organization are publicly vilified as revolutionaries and Communists.    &quot;They are always looking for ways to get us,&quot; Mr. Kgori says.    The dirt road comes to a paved intersection, and Mr. Kgori begins a right turn. Up ahead, he spots a roadblock, where a white policeman with a dog is holding up three blacks traveling on a donkey-pulled wagon. Mr. Kgori decides to go straight, on the dirt road, even though it will take him an hour out of his way.    &quot;It's best to avoid them,&quot; he says. &quot;Who knows what they want? What do they want with somebody on a donkey cart?&quot;    Geysdorp   &quot;You must pardon us. We are poor here,&quot; says Levi Segopolo, welcoming visitors to his farmhouse. &quot;We didn't want it to be this way.&quot;    Mr. Segopolo is the proud leader of two nearby resettlement villages, Ganalaagte and Vrischgewaagd. The residents, about 7,000 in all, were removed from their farms (which they had owned for decades) in the western Transvaal and dumped here in Bophuthatswana in 1978. At the time, they were promised they would be given an equal amount of land for planting and grazing. But after two years, when they refused to adopt Bophuthatswana citizenship, the government reneged.    Today, they live in terrible poverty, surrounded by fertile corn and sunflower fields tilled by people who cooperate with the homeland government. The people of Ganalaagte have been given only an area the size of a football field that doubles as a cemetery and pasture. The more the cemetery expands, the less room for grazing. Thus, cows roam the dusty streets, munching whatever grass they can find. Farm machinery sits idle, rusting away. The residents have no source of income other than pensions (generally less than $100 per quarter) and money sent home by children working in South Africa.    Mr. Kgori has come to offer the SACC's solidarity, and to gather information for lawyers working to get some land for the residents to farm. &quot;It is important for these people to know that they aren't struggling alone,&quot; Mr. Kgori says. &quot;Those of us in the cities, we share their pain.&quot;    Mr. Segopolo asks Mr. Kgori when the suffering will end, even though he knows this man from the church can't give him an answer. &quot;We just want the chance to live like human beings,&quot; Mr. Segopolo says, staring into the flame of the lone candle lighting his living room.    Mr. Kgori shakes his head sadly. &quot;I don't understand why people have to live like this,&quot; he says. &quot;Even though I work for the church, I sometimes come to doubt whether God does care for us.&quot;    Such frustration and doubt have led many blacks his age to leave the country and take up revolutionary work in exile. But Mr. Kgori has chosen to remain at home. &quot;Here,&quot; he says, &quot;is where the real struggle is. We must stay and fight.&quot;    In the distance, at the end of the driveway, the headlights are approaching. </TEXT></DOC>
