Chairman Donald Petersen's $10.5million pay for 1988 is part of ``Detroit's annual executivepigout'' and should be spent on new employees and factoriesinstead, the United Auto Workers union says.   Ford issued its proxy statement Monday, listing compensation forthe company's top five executives. Also on Monday, Ford announcedthree new executive vice presidents, including the likely successorto Petersen.   The proxy statement said Petersen was awarded $3.3 million insalry, bonuses and other benefits and $7.2 million in stock optionsfor 1988. That's far beyond the $3.7 million Chrysler Corp.Chairman Lee Iacocca received for 1988.   General Motors Corp. is expected to issue its proxy statementwithin a week.   At Ford, President Harold Poling followed Petersen incompensation with awards of $4.1 million _ $2.6 million in salaryand supplemental compensation and $1.5 million in exercised stockoptions.   The UAW said it was pleased by Ford's financial success lastyear, but that its profits should be invested instead in thecompany and its hourly employees rather than its executives.   ``We think they would be far better advised to invest in newfacilities and hire more employees rather than squander valuableresources on trying to keep up with the compensation of junk-bondbarons,'' UAW President Owen Bieber and Vice President StephenYokich, who heads the union's Ford Department, said in a statement.   ``Ford's success in no way justifies the action of Ford's topexecutives in taking full advantage of Detroit's annual executivepigout,'' they said.   The UAW figured Petersen's hourly wage to be about $5,070,compared with the hourly wage of a car assembler at $15.73.   Last year, Ford said Petersen exercised no stock options andreceived $3.7 million. Poling exercised $8 million in stock optionsand received $10.9 million in compensation for 1987.   Other Ford officers listed in Monday's proxy statement, alongwith their salaries, supplemental compensation payments and stockoptions exercised, were:   _Louis R. Ross, executive vice president for North Americanautomotive operations and named Monday as executive vice presidentfor international automotive operations, $3.5 million.   _Philip Benton, executive vice president and president of theFord Automotive Group, $3 million.   _Allan Gilmour, Ross' predecessor in international operationswho Monday was appointed executive vice president for corporatestaffs, $1.7 million.   Supplemental compensation payments can be deferred into commonstock purchase or other programs. Otherwise, the awards will bepaid in two lump sums, one last month and the other in January1990, the company said.   Ford, the nation's most profitable automaker with earnings of$5.3 billion last year, said its board of directors' compensationcommittee limited the total compensation for eligible officers to$250 million.   The compensation plan permitted distribution of $375.1 million.The difference, $125.1 million, will become part of the company'sgeneral fund.   The appointments of Gilmour, Ross and Alexander Trotman, who wasnamed Ross' successor, are effective May 1.   Gilmour also was named to the office of the chief executive andbecomes the odds-on choice to become chairman when Petersen reachesFord's mandatory retirement age of 65 in the fall of 1991. Thatoffice is shared by Petersen, Poling and Executive Vice Presidentand Chief Financial Officer Stanley Seneker.   At the end of March, Vice Chairman William Clay Ford Sr.,grandson of the company's founder, Henry Ford, retired from thecompany and with it, his title was eliminated. Ford, who was amember of the office of the chief executive, remains a member ofthe company's board of directors.   The promotion of Gilmour, 54, leaves only GM among the Big Threewithout an heir apparent to its chairman. GM Chairman Roger B.Smith will be the first of the Big Three's leaders to step aside.Smith turns 65 in July 1990 and is expected to step down about then.   In November, Chrysler promoted Gerald Greenwald to vicechairman, tapping him as the likely successor to Chairman LeeIacocca, whose contract expires in December 1991.   Gilmour joined Ford in 1960 as a financial analyst. During hiscareer with Ford he has been president of Ford Motor Credit Co.,vice president and controller, vice president for extrnal andpersonnel affairs, and executive vice president and chief financialofficer.</TEXT></DOC>
