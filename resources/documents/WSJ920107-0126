The Privatization Ministry chief in the two-week-oldgovernment of Prime Minister Jan Olszewski, said,&quot;Privatization policy must be subordinated to industrialpolicy.&quot; Mr. Olszewski intends to downgrade the agency andmake it part of a planned Economics Ministry.   The agency will draft laws to strengthen Warsaw's role inthe firms, in which increased efficiency and profitabilitycurrently aren't demanded.   The policy change is a marked departure from the previousgovernment, which was eager to sell state firms through stockofferings or joint ventures, and which proposed last June toprivatize about 200 enterprises representing one-fourth ofPoland's industrial output.                                                                                                          FOREIGN EXCHANGE IN PHILIPPINES                                                                                                          The Philippine central bank's decision to scrap someforeign-exchange restrictions and relax others will easedoing business in the country. Yet the changes fall short ofthe sweeping reform some companies wanted and, analysts said,are insufficient to attract new investment. The rules, whichtake effect Jan. 20, will increase the amount of foreignexchange that exporters can retain to pay their bills, andsimplify procedures for repatriating foreign investment.                                                                                                          WORLD'S `WORST' RESORTS LISTED                                                                                                          The Consumer Association, a British group that evaluatesproducts and services, published a list of nine resorts itrecommended avoiding. The guide, based on letters from theassociation's &quot;Which?&quot; magazine, warned against Pattaya inThailand, for sleaziness; Nabeul in Tunisia, polluted beachesbordered by open sewers; Sunny Beach in Bulgaria, crime; ElArenal on the Spanish island of Majorca, overcrowding;Turkey's Gumbet, &quot;scruffy&quot; appearance; Kanoni in Corfu,nearby airport noise; France's La GrandeMotte, bleakness;Quarteira in the Portuguese Algarve, ugliness; and Gzira, the&quot;worst slum in Malta.&quot;                                                                                                          KUWAIT'S REBUILDING CACHE                                                                                                          Kuwait expects to spend $10.28 billion on Persian GulfWar-related expenses in the year ending June 30, including$7.31 billion for military costs and $1.34 billion to writeoff Kuwaitis' consumer loans. The Middle East Economic Surveysaid the budget includes spending of $20.99 billion, up 67%from a year earlier when outlays were interrupted by theIraqi invasion. Revenue, mostly from oil sales, was put at $3billion, leaving an $18.29 billion deficit, but this excludesearnings from Kuwait's huge overseas investments.                                                                                                          INDONESIA AIMS FOR STABILITY                                                                                                          Indonesia, choosing not to dangle any election-year plums,proposed a budget to control spending and raise more taxes,putting stability ahead of growth.   The draft budget for the year starting April 1, presentedto Parliament by President Suharto, reflects concern aboutinflation, now about 10% a year; a big balance-of-paymentsdeficit, and moves for less dependence on foreign aid.   Though parliamentary elections are due in June, Jakartashrugged off popular moves such as spending boosts in favorof continued cooling of the overheated economy and repayingdebt faster. Tax rates wouldn't change, but the value-addedtax would be broadened to many retail outlets, and the tax oncompanies' interest income on time deposits would be altered.   Spending would total 56.11 trillion rupiah ($28.27billion), up 11% from this year's budget but up only 1% afterinflation -- and down in dollar terms if the rupiah continuesto depreciate. The plan wouldn't help business and could hurtretailers, but some foreign executives were encouraged by thelong-term stability goal and hopes for eased monetary policy.
