Britoil, the United Kingdom's largest independent oil company, Friday agreed that Arco would acquire in two stages slightly less than 50% of the British company in exchange for the U.S. oil concern's exploration and development operations outside North America. The agreement aims to block British Petroleum Co.'s bid for 29.9% of Britoil, which is widely assumed by analysts and investment bankers to be a prelude to a takeover offer.    The British government said only that it is &quot;studying&quot; the Arco-Britoil agreement. The government last week indicated it wouldn't oppose BP's bid for a partial Britoil stake, but it left open the question of its attitude toward a possible full takeover. When the government sold the last of Britoil to private investors in 1985, it kept the right to block changes of control via a so-called golden share.    Britoil said that &quot;in theory,&quot; the government's approval isn't needed for the agreement, because Arco wouldn't have majority control or a majority on the board. But in practice, the government has to examine the consequences of the Arco link.    If the government takes no action, Britoil, the leader of what was supposed to be a spirited new breed of independent oil companies, could end up strongly allied with a major U.S. oil company -- displeasing BP, which is Britain's largest company, and nationalistic politicians. Moreover, government inaction could lead to a stalemate. BP said it still intends to acquire 29.9% of Britoil, which would enable it to fight Britoil's link to Arco. That link requires shareholder approval.    The government could instead decide to set its golden share aside and let BP, Arco and perhaps other investors fight it out for full control of Britoil. Or it could use that golden share to favor a takeover by one of Britoil's suitors. But any action that would cost Britoil its independence also would cost the government support in Scotland, where Glasgow-based Britoil is one of the region's few big independent companies.    In the first stage of its investment, Arco on Friday acquired 7.7% of Britoil and said it would seek to buy as much as 29.9% of the company at 350 pence ($6.42) a share, valuing Britoil at about #1.75 billion ($3.21 billion). Britoil was quoted late Friday on London's stock exchange at 352 pence, up from 294 pence Thursday.    Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers briefly halted Arco's purchases of Britoil shares on Friday, but a Britoil spokesman said that following a clarification of the regulatory panel's stance, Arco is free to proceed today with further purchases.    The Arco move stymies a BP tender offer that expires Wednesday, under which BP is offering 300 pence a share in an attempt to raise its 14.9% stake in Britoil to 29.9%. The 29.9% levels sought by both companies fall just below the 30% level at which British takeover rules require a full bid.    BP can't increase its offer until the tender period ends. But it said that following the offer's expiration, it intends to buy shares for more than 350 pence each. Carol Bell, an analyst at the London stockbrokerage Phillips andamp; Drew, said she doubted that BP would pay more than 375 pence a share for Britoil because of BP's own debt levels.    Arco and Britoil, meanwhile, haven't nailed down precise details of their planned alliance. Arco would hand over &quot;all or most&quot; of its oil and gas activities outside North America. Britoil would issue Arco new shares sufficient to raise Arco's stake to 49.9% from the 29.9% it already is seeking. That would require a waiver by the U.K. takeover panel of its bid rules.    The scramble for Britoil reflects a belief among major oil companies that the stock-market crash produced some bargains among Britain's smaller oil companies. On Friday, for example, Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine of France bid #134.7 million for Tricentrol PLC, another small U.K. oil company.    &quot;The bigger companies can see through a shaky dollar-sterling rate and oil price&quot; to the oil reserves, said Bill Harrison, director of U.K. investment banking for Shearson Lehman Brothers, a Britoil adviser.    Arco &quot;has been looking for ways to increase its opportunities overseas,&quot; said Lodwrick Cook, the Los Angeles-based company's chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;You have to do what you have to do when you see your opportunity,&quot; he said, dismissing concerns about further weakening of the dollar and oil prices.    Britoil hopes to present its alliance with Arco as the best deal for the company and for Britain -- especially Scotland. David Walker, Britoil's chief executive, said the company had been studying for a year ways to expand its oil and gas reserves outside the North Sea. Mr. Walker said the Arco properties, which are concentrated in Indonesia, would increase Britoil's total reserves by about a third.    U.S. analysts reacted favorably to the Arco move. &quot;For Arco, if it's eventually completed, it's a well-thought-out, low-risk approach to increasing its international position,&quot; said Eugene Nowak, an oil analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., New York.    ---   Earl C.
