The drop in the rate from 5.8% of the work force in January brings joblessness to its lowest level since July 1979, when the rate was also 5.7%, the Labor Department said. Nonfarm payrolls spurted by 531,000 last month after a revised 174,000-job rise in January, previously reported as 107,000.    The stock market eased, apparently more concerned with takeover speculation. But the unemployment report stunned the bond market, sending long-term Treasury bonds down steeply.    Most economists have been contending that growth is slowing markedly in the current quarter as businesses work off the sharp inventory buildup of the fourth quarter and the economy continues to feel some aftereffects of the stock market crash. But the latest jobless figures suggest that any weakening has been far smaller than expected.    &quot;This is an A-plus report card,&quot; said Robert Wescott, vice president at Alphametrics Corp. in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. He said that while he still expects slower growth in the first quarter than in the fourth, &quot;no economy goes from creating half a million jobs in a month to a recession anytime soon thereafter. The economy is looking pretty good right now for 1988.&quot;    In an appearance before the Senate Budget Committee, Treasury Secretary James Baker called the figures &quot;extremely encouraging.&quot; Asked whether monetary policy has been appropriate, he said, &quot;I am in fundamental agreement with the monetary policy being pursued by the Federal Reserve. The unemployment numbers confirm that policy.&quot;    The continued drop in the unemployment rate below 6% -- a level that some economists consider &quot;full employment&quot; -- may renew fears of a surge in inflation and interest rates. The employment report triggered a sharp rise in interest rates in the bond market Friday.    Further strong employment gains could put pressure on the Fed to raise rates, which in turn could slow economic growth. For now, however, economists say February's report suggests a healthy economy without heralding an acceleration in inflation or a significant rise in interest rates.    The bulk of the job gains -- 403,000 -- occurred in the service sector, with business services and health services posting big rises. Retail trade jobs increased as post-Christmas cutbacks were much smaller than usual, although there was also less hiring before the holiday, too.    Employment fell by about 10,000 in the finance industry. The department called this decline &quot;the first tangible impact on business payrolls of the October stock market crash.&quot;    Manufacturing jobs rose a modest 20,000 in February after an increase of 18,000 the month before. Weekly factory hours fell to 40.9 from 41.1, with overtime down to 3.8 hours from 3.9. Slower factory-sector growth also was suggested by the latest monthly survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management.    Still, economists generally expect continued health for the nation's manufacturers as a result of strong export demand.    Overall, weekly hours rose to 34.9 from 34.7.    Total goods-producing employment, which includes construction and mining as well as manufacturing, grew by 128,000 after a 55,000-job decline in January. Most of the rise occurred in construction, a sector that many analysts nonetheless contend is growing weakly.    Using a measure that counts the military among the employed, the unemployment rate fell to 5.6% from 5.7%.    The department's household survey, which is used in calculating the unemployment rate, showed a rise of 280,000 jobs after a 385,000-job increase in January.    Average hourly earnings fell to $9.12 last month from $9.14 in January. The department's hourly earnings index, which excludes wage changes caused by factory overtime and shift differentials, rose to 176.5% of its 1977 average from 176.4%.
