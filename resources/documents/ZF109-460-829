(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OFFICEVISION BATTLING LATE ACCEPTANCE, DELAYSandM;&quot;Why use OfficeVision?andP;  We already have Profs,&quot; is a question frequentlyasked by users.andM;Profs is IBM's Professional Office System, providing functions such as textmanagement, diary and messaging.andM;Many users feel that OfficeVision--IBM's family of server-requester officeproducts that complies with the Systems Application Architecture (SAA)blueprint--does not offer much improvement over their currently installed IBMoffice products.andP;  However, some cost-conscious people in Texas look at thisissue quite differently.andM;&quot;Why not use OFficeVision?andP;  It delivers Profs to us less expensively andgives us valuable integration capabilities.andP;  why wouldn't we put it in?&quot;andO;asked Jim Zoccoli, assistant VP of Applciations and Systems Programming forTexas Credit Union League and Affiliates (TCUL) in Dallas.andM;&quot;Our cost per month is less under OfficeVision than Profs,&quot; said Zoccoli.andO;&quot;And our management are real dollars-and-cents people.&quot;andM;Zoccoli said TCUL is saving hundreds of dollars a month on its lease ofOfficeVision, compared to the lease on Profs.andP;  &quot;We already had the PS/2s, sothere was no additional cost there,&quot; he added.andM;The OfficeVision server can run on OS/2, VM, MVS (XA or ESA) or OS/400.andP;  Therequester runs on OS/2 Extended Edition or DOS.andM;Even more imortant, said Zoccoli, is the ability to unite separate functionsusing OfficeVision/VM, which uses a VM system as a server.andP;  The product'sintegration capabilities let them create the &quot;TCUL Big Picture,&quot; a graphicalworkbench containing high-level operating figures.andP;  This is very popular withTCUL executives.andM;Integration is one of IBM's biggest selling points for Office Vision.andP;  IBMemphasizes that Office Vision will integrate various office activities, aswell as integrate the office functions with the rest of the business, leadingto enterprise integration--a growing concern for companies these days.andM;&quot;The fact that it is part of IBM's Systems Application Architecture is animportant part of Office Vision,&quot; said Dave Nelson, vice president of IMIComputing, a consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn.andM;&quot;True, it's not all there yet,&quot; said Nelson, &quot;but people are usingOffice-Vision now as a competitive advantage.andP;  It gets them started tyingapplications together.&quot;andM;OfficeVision has the integration capabilities for which clients are looking,said Nelson.andP;  In addition, because OfficeVision is part of SAA, usersencounter the same format across all applications.andM;&quot;Large enterprise accounts are trying to find a way to hook everyone up--tolet people access each other's stuff,&quot; said Nelson.andP;  &quot;OfficeVision isbecoming the cohesive factor in their entire system.&quot;andM;USERS, DEVELOPER COMMUNICATEandM;IMI has recently provided training, consulting and integration services forOfficeVision customers.andM;&quot;One of the most important things OfficeVision does for customers,&quot; saidNelson, &quot;is it starts their thinking along the lines of integration.andP;  Wesponson sessions where end users and application developers meet together.andO;They are all asked, 'What does it mean to integrate out line of business.?andO;After they wrestle with that and think it through, understanding among themdevelops.andM;&quot;You can see the lights go on in everyone's head,&quot; continued Nelson.andP;  &quot;MISstarts to understand what the customer wants and the customer begins tounderstand MIS.andP;  They're finall able to communicate.andP;  As a result, everyoneis more efficient.&quot;andM;Benefitting from this kind of synergy, one company that asked not to beidentified is now using OfficeVision to sell used equipment more efficiently.andO;This large agricultural machinery company in the Midwest has numerous dealerswho recently became hooked up to OfficeVision and now send messages to eachother regularly.andP;  In addition to selling new equipment, the company has anactive market for used machinery.andP;  In the past, they would send out thousandsof notices about used equipment as it became available.andM;&quot;Now they use the OfficeVision bulletin board,&quot; said Nelson.andP;  &quot;When usedequipment is available, the notice is posted on the bulletin board.andP;  Whendealers log in, they see it.andP;  If interested, the dealer can get moreinformation about the equipment.&quot;andP;  The transaction is expedited for everyone.andM;&quot;This is just one of the many new uses people are making of OfficeVision,&quot;said Nelson.andP;  Part of his company's role is to help customers find new waysto benefit from integrating office functions into their line of business.andM;ANY USERS OUT THERE?andM;Despite OfficeVision's growing acceptence, there is a perception among manypeople that OfficeVision is not widely used--it at all.andM;&quot;You mean you actually found people who are really using Office-Vision?&quot; saidJoseph Allegra, president of Princeton softech in Princeton, N.J.A consultantwho has many contacts, Allegra said, &quot;None of my clients have it installed,and I just don't hear very much about it.&quot;andM;&quot;There are a lot more OfficeVsion users than people think,&quot; declared TonyMondello, vice president of Office Ststems in IBM's Applications SolutionsDivision in Milford, Conn.andP;  He said one problem is that many people haveequated all of OfficeVision with just OfficeVison/2 LAN.andP;  Release 2.0 ofOfficeVision/2 LAN is late--causing many sales to be deferred.andP;  The LANproduct, however, is only one of the four platforms available.andM;&quot;it's important for people to know that OfficeVision is a lot more than ourOS/2LAN implementation,&quot; said Dick Anderson, vice president of Office SystemsMarketing with IBM's Application Solutions Division.andM;OfficeVision is available on four platforms: OfficeVision/MVS,OfficeVision/VM, OfficeVision/400 and OfficeVision/2 LAN.andM;&quot;In addition,&quot; said Anderson, &quot;we have a number of related products, some ofthe most important of which are in the decision support arena.&quot;andM;There are four products in this category.andP;  Executive Decisions is theexecutive support system product.andP;  The three dicision support systems includeApplication Systems, the Data Interpretation System and Lotus 1-2-3M.andP;  Theseproducts are available on a variety of OfficeVision platforms.andM;Executive Decisions is a host-based system that can graphically display dataon the executives desktop workstation.andP;  application Systems is a hostdecision support product with a fourth-generation language (4GL) and dataquery capability.andP;  The Data Interpretation System is a sophisticated andpopular package from Metaphor Computer Systems in Mountain View, Calif.andM;&quot;Lotus 1-2-3M is a host-based version of 1-2-3 that Lotus built for IBM&quot;,said Mondello.andP;  &quot;It lets you collect and distribute templates and data fromLotus.&quot;andM;Over half of all MVS/XA sites are planning to introduce OfficeVision,according to research from Xephon Technology Transfer LTD., Berkshire,England.andP;  (See Fig.andP;  1.)andP;  Many sites with electronic mail packages still planto install OfficeVision as well, Xephon reported.andP;  For example, of all thesites surveyed, about half of thosw with Profs, all of the those with DISOSSand three quarters of those with PS/CICS are planning to installOfficeVision.andM;&quot;About half of the OfficeVision/MVS implementations are new to IBM officeproducts,&quot; said Anderson.andP;  &quot;In the VM arena, the majority of OfficeVision/VMcustomers are migrations from Profs.candM;Anderson said these two products have exceeded their sales projections in theeight months they have been available.andM;&quot;In the OfficeVision/400 arena, we have more than 20,000 implementationsworldwide,&quot; said Anderson.andP;  &quot;That is as successful an office product as thereis in the industry.&quot;andM;Anderson concedes that IBM has not had as many implementations as they wouldlike in the Office Vision/2 LAN arena.andM;&quot;Part of that,&quot; said Anderson, &quot;is because we had planned to have the fullimplementation available in March.&quot;andP;  That did not happen.andP;  Delivery of animportant version of OV/2 LAN has been delayed and will not be avilable untilthe fourth quarter of this year.andP;  The delay results from a slippage in thedelivery of OS/2 Extended Edition (EE) and the complications of integratingOfficeVision across the entire SAA environment.andM;&quot;We'd rather delay the shipment,&quot; said David Ehnebuske, technical consultantto IBM's OfficeVision Westlake Laboratory near Dallas, &quot;than disappointanyone.andP;  We think we have a real winner here and we're going to make sureit's right.&quot;andM;WAITING FOR LAN RELEASEandM;The version due in the fourth quarter, Release 2.0 of Office Vision/2 LAN, iseagerly awaited in the industry.andP;  It will be able to serve as a front end toprocessing on other IBM platforms.andP;  IBM expects sales of Office Vision topick up when that release is available--especially among customers who havealready moved to PS/2s and OS/2 EE.andM;&quot;With that release,&quot; said Anderson, &quot;you can have a common graphical userinterface across all four IBM SAA implementations: OS/2, MVS, VM and AS/400.&quot;andM;Customers are planning to develop cooperative processing applications withthe capabilities contained in this release.andP;  Many third-party softwarevendors are upgrading their existing products to take advantage of these newcapabilities, too.andP;  (See sidebar, &quot;Integrating Applications with OfficeVision.&quot;)andM;&quot;It helps to understand the rollout of that product,&quot; said Anderson.andM;&quot;Office Vision/2 was originally available in September 1989.andP;  That allows youto do basic E-mail on a LAN implementation.andP;  Then we have a second release,1.1, which allows you to run on OS/2 Version 1.2, the new version of OS/2.andO;This is a brand-new release of Office Vision that adds significant functionto the LAN user.andP;  It allows you to do things like window 3270 applications,&quot;said Anderson.andP;  That release was available on May 22, 1990.andM;He continued, &quot;And then we have a third version, Release 2, available in thefourth quarter.andP;  That one comes in a couple of flavors.andP;  It allows you to notonly run in a LAN environment, it lets you connect to all the otherplatforms.&quot;andM;IBM supports a DOS implementation as well, said Anderson, though it does nothave the graphical user interface that the OS/2 implementation has.andM;Many customers are wondering what kind of support IBM might offer for Windows3.0 under DOS.andM;&quot;IBM has clearly shown itself to be--at least in the last several years--avery market-driven company,&quot; said Jerrold Grochow, vice president ofcorporate technology for American Management Systems in Arlington, Va.andP;  &quot;Iwould have to believe the Office Vision organization sees the kind ofreception that Windows 3.0 has received and will, therefore, come out withsome version of their product under Windows 3.0.&quot;andM;At present, no Office Vision products are available for Windows 3.0 underDOS.andP;  Nevertheless, IBM maintains that what is offered for DOS has a lot ofvalue.andM;&quot;The DOS version lets you do all the office functions interactively with thehost and it gives you the ability to do some file-transfer activity,&quot; saidAnderson.andP;  &quot;For example, you can transfer your mail down to the PC-DOSstation and work on it there.andP;  Then when you're ready to send mail, thesystem handles the interaction with the MVS or VM host.&quot;andM;Federal Kemper Insurance in Decatur, Ill., is an Office Vision user.andM;&quot;I agree that Office Vision isn't all there,&quot; stated Keith Sievers, an MISmanager at the insurance company.andP;  &quot;In fact, you could say it's more of aconcept than an actual product.andP;  However, the concept is tremendous.&quot;andM;Sievers said there is enough functionality available in Office Vision now forthem to benefit from it.andM;&quot;Right now, the big thing for us is its interconnectivity and itsflexibility,&quot; said Sievers.andP;  &quot;It allows us to incorporate a lot of our ownapplications into an office network.andP;  That's a big draw for us.&quot;andM;According to Sievers, Kemper can interconnect its in-house applications withprint and E-mail functions more easily now.andM;&quot;If we have a set of data from one of our applications that can be viewed asa graphical object [an icon], we can interface it with Office Vision supportfeatures.andP;  That is, we can just drop it on a printer or drop it on amailbox,&quot; Sievers explained.andM;When Sievers' staff &quot;drops&quot; an icon representing data from an application ona printer icon, the data is printed; when the data icon is &quot;dropped&quot; (placedon top of) a mailbox icon, that data is mailed to someone.andP;  A mouse is usedto move icons on the workstation screen.andM;Sievers said he looked at other products like HP's New Wave and thought itwas expensive.andP;  In addition, he did not think it would integrate as well withtheir installation.andP;  &quot;It would have meant a new vendor for us,&quot; Sievers said.andO;He feels that IBM will offer them a better long-term integration path thanother vendors.andM;The most popular platform for Office Vision at this time is Office Vision/VM.andM;&quot;WE have a few million Profs users on VM systems around the world,&quot; saidMondello.andP;  &quot;We expect 30% to 40% of them to be Office Vision/VM users beforethe end of the year.&quot;andM;A significant part of that 30% to 40% could come from IBM itself.andP;  Mondellosaid, &quot;We'll be moving 200,000 IBM Profs users to Office Vision this year.&quot;andM;The Texas Credit Union League and Affiliates is a prime example of a customerthat moved from Profs to Office Vision.andP;  TCUL's Zuccoli said he cannotunderstand why anyone would have a problem with Office Vision.andP;  &quot;We are veryhappy with it,&quot; he said.andM;The integration capabilities of Office Vision let TCUL tie a lot of differentvendors' products together on one menu, said Zuccoli.andP;  &quot;For example, we haveGDDM, IBM's mainframe three-dimensional graphics product.andP;  We also haveFocus, the 4GL from [New York-based] Information Builders.andM;&quot;In addition, we have GDDM Rexx, IBM's high-level language for building verysophisticated interfaces between different products.andM;&quot;The beauty of Office Vision,&quot; Zoccoli continued, &quot;is that executives sign onto one menu in VM and they can get to Focus systems, graphics systems thatare GDDM-based, or to their electronic mail.andP;  It's all tied together.&quot;andM;The system is getting widespread use.andP;  &quot;All our officers, from the presidenton down, have terminals on their desks and are personally using Office Visioneach day,&quot; said Zuccoli.andP;  &quot;Their secretaries also have terminals with OfficeVision, but the officers use their own system each day.andP;  It is the standardof communication in our organization.&quot;andM;The TCUL Big Picture system uses GDDM as its graphics presentation managerand was written in Rexx.andP;  The TCUL Big Picture is a menu item on everyexecutive's workstation.andP;  When executives pick that item on the Office Visionmenu, they go into a graphics infprmation system.andM;&quot;Let's say they want to look at pro forma graphs for financial analysis.andO;When they're looking at a graph, they might want to act on that graph.andP;  Well,the prompts on the bottom of the graph are Office Vision prompts: o send anote, to look in our company directory (which we maintain on Office Vision),or to set up a meeting,&quot; said Zuccoli.andM;&quot;Suppose he wants to send a note to the vice president saying, 'I want you tofix this sales shortfall.'andP;  He just hits a PF key and he is in theSend-a-Note function in Office Vision.andP;  When he's finished sending the note,he winds up back in the TCUL Big Picture where he came from.&quot;andM;Zoccoli said Office Vision is the conduit that ties all their differentproducts and applications together.andP;  &quot;To our staff, everything appears to beOffice Vision.andP;  The beauty of that is, as a result, training is minimal andno one is intimidated by the technology.&quot;andM;They also like the additional functions they get from Office Vision.andP;  (SinceOffice Vision is now the replacement product for Profs, new functionality forProfs is only available to Office Vision users.)andM;&quot;The bulletin board and the shared in-baskets were big lures for us.andP;  We'rebig on communication, and the bulletin board makes it very easy to getstandardized communication to everyone in the organization,&quot; said Zoccoli.andM;The bulletin board was set up by their Profs administrator.andP;  It ismenu-driven and has multiple hierarchical levels.andP;  &quot;At the top is a corporatelevel, then you have company levels and under that you have departmentlevels.andP;  You indicate the level you're interested in,&quot; explained Zoccoli.andM;&quot;Suppose the North parking lot was being resurfaced next week.andP;  You wouldwant everyone to know not to park in the North parking lot.andP;  Or suppose youwere changing major personnel policies.andP;  You could communicate these throughthe bulletin board's corporate level.andP;  On the other hand, if Mary Sue had ababy girl, that announcement might go out at the department level,&quot; saidZoccoli.andM;Another reason the Texas Credit Union League brought in Office Vision isbecause they are very interested in IBM's Systems Application Architecture(SAA).andM;&quot;We don't buy in on everything IBM comes out with, but we do buy in to SAA,&quot;said Zoccoli.andP;  The common user access and functionality across platformsappeals to them.andP;  The Texas Credit Union League and Affiliates consists ofover a dozen financial institutions in Texas, all related in some way tocredit unions.andM;&quot;Because we are in the process of supporting a lot of different businessentities, some of them very small, er see some real dividends down the roadfrom being ablt to go across platforms.&quot;andM;EARLY SUPPORT PROGRAMandM;Among the happiest Office Vision users are participants in IBM's earlysupport program.andP;  Many signed up to meet specific requirements as well as toget the extra support offered to a early user.andM;&quot;We were part of the early support program,&quot; said Bill Hooper, an MISexecutive with General American Life Insurance in St. Louis.andP;  &quot;Our presidentwanted an executive information system.andP;  We had never done a system likethat.&quot;andM;Being part of the early support program, they not only received help froomIBM with Office Vision, they also received valuable guidance in how to set upan executive information system.andM;&quot;It's completely different from your regular DP system,&quot; said Hooper.andP;  &quot;Muchof the needed information is not in your traditional production systems.andO;Some of the data is in various PC spreadsheets and reporting systems; some isin manually created reports.andM;&quot;The raw figures are everywhere,&quot; added Hooper.andP;  IBM helped them pull it alltogether.andM;&quot;The president likes the system very much,&quot; said Hooper.andP;  &quot;He uses it everyday.&quot;andM;On the president's desk is just a monitor and a mouse in a special case.andP;  &quot;Hedoesn't have a keyboard at all,&quot; said Hooper.andP;  There is no need for him touse one.andP;  He does everything he needs to do with the mouse.andP;  The monitor ispart of a PS/2 Model 70.andP;  &quot;It's like having a mini-mainframe on his desk,&quot;said Hooper.andP;  &quot;We create a lot of the graphs on the mainframe and refreshthem on the PC.andM;&quot;The chief operating officer and the chief financial officer are using thesystem.andP;  We're in the process of expanding it to the executive vice presidentlevel now,&quot; said Hooper.andM;REPLACING MOUNTAINS OF MANUALSandM;Progress toward a &quot;paperless office&quot; is being made by another participant inIBM's early support program.andP;  Motorists Mutual Insurance of Columbus, Ohio,is replacing mountains of manuals with Office Vision's bulletin boardcapability.andM;&quot;We took our company manuals and put them on Office Vision's bulletin board,&quot;said Jay Huey, vice president of information systems.andP;  &quot;Every supervisor hasa personnel manual telling how to handle overtime, illness, etc.andP;  All that isnow on the bulletin board.andM;&quot;Corporate planners have planning manuals--really thick documents.andP;  They'reall on the bulletin board.andP;  The corporate manual went away, too.andP;  It's all onthe bulletin board.andP;  Our job openings are now listed on the bulletin board aswell.andP;  We have 650 bulletin board users and they just keep coming up with newuses for it.&quot;andM;Huey said they are very dependent on the system.andP;  &quot;Everyone has a terminal orPC.andP;  In fact, in this company we have more PCs and terminals thantelephones.&quot;andP;  The reason for that, he explained, ist that key people havetwo: one at home and one in the office.andP;  When a production system bombs, theydo not have to wait out the travel time for someone to get to the office.andO;They just fix the system from their terminal at home.andM;&quot;Our people love the Office Vision system,&quot; said Heuy.andP;  &quot;In fact, when thesystem is down, I get more phone calls about that than when our onlineinsurance application system is down.&quot;andM;The Trump-like merger and acquisition scene brought IBM another Office Visioncustomer.andP;  Originally an IBM shop United Gas and Pipeline in Houston wasacquired by Occidental Petroleum in Los Angeles and Midcon Corp. in Lombard,Ill.andM;&quot;Wang was their standard,&quot; said Joe Cantu, vice president of MIS for UnitedGas.andP;  &quot;Electronic mail was important since we were spread out across thecountry, so we purchased Wang equipment, too.andM;&quot;Then we were split apart through a leveraged buyout.andP;  After that, we weresmaller and couldn't affort to support two vendors.&quot;andM;United Gas carefully examined IBM's office products before making the switch.andM;&quot;I won't kid you,&quot; said Cantu, &quot;the Wang office products were really good.andO;Our users were very happy.andP;  It isn't easy to move users to a new system fromone they like.andM;&quot;However, they don't understand the economies the way I do.andP;  With all themergers and acquisitions, we're better off in the long run converging on onehardware vendor,&quot; explained Cantu.andM;When they compared Profs to the Wang system, Profs was found to be lacking.andO;&quot;Profs alone couldn't compare to Wang.andP;  Office Vision had more of the userfriendliness that the Wang system has,&quot; said Cantu.andM;&quot;The conversion had significant economic consequences for us,&quot; said Cantu.andO;&quot;We're very dependent on E-mail in our company.andP;  To be able to migrate toOffice Vision without losing functionality was important.andP;  But also, we hadthe extra capacity on the IBM mainframe.andP;  Now, as the leases come due on theWang boxes, we're turning them back in.&quot;andM;During this ongoing conversion period, it is important that the Wang users beable to interconnect with the Office Vision users.andP;  But in setting that up,Cantu had another complication to deal with.andM;&quot;We also have five local-area networks in the company,&quot; explained Cantu.andO;&quot;There are probably 30 to 50 users on each LAN.andP;  They all use cc:mail.&quot;andO;cc:Mail is an electronic mail package from cc:Mail Inc., located in MountainView, Calif.andM;&quot;We brought in Soft-Switch to solve the whole problem,&quot; said Cantu.andO;Soft-Switch, based in Wayne, Pa., is one of IBM's business partners,specializing in electronic mail interconnectivity for IBM.andP;  (See sidebar,&quot;The Office System Supermarket.&quot;)andM;&quot;Soft-Switch tied our Novell LANs into Office Vision and tied our Wang systemto Office Vision as well,&quot; said Cantu.andM;There were some problems at first.andP;  &quot;But IBM and Soft-Switch worked togetheron it and now it's great,&quot; stated Cantu.andM;Interconnectivity and integration are major themes among Office Vision users.andO;Just like the Texas Credit Union League was able to create the TCUL BigPicture, others are interested in seeing their diverse automated systemsemerge into an overall &quot;big picture&quot; -- yielding an enterprise-wide computingstrategy.andM;This is a key goal of integrated architectures like SAA.andP;  Many early usersare taking advantage of Office-Vision and its capabilities to get them goingin just that direction.andM;The Office System SupermarketandM;Connectivity solution lets users mix, match productsandM;Our view of the office products market is one of an office systemsupermarket,&quot; said Adam Sroczynski, president of Verimation in Northvale,N.J., which markets Memo, an electronic mail package.andM;&quot;Our customers who are using Memo are insterested in OfficeVision,&quot; saidSroczynski.andP;  &quot;Being a third-party vendor with a very large installed customerbase, our customers are asking us, &quot;What are you going to do aboutOfficeVision?'&quot;andM;Srocynski said he is going to continue competing the way he always has.andP;  Memocan fit in and interact with OfficeVision.andP;  Customers may either ignore oruse OfficeVision's E-mail component.andM;Sroczynski's vision is one of companies being able to mix a variety of officeproducts together.andP;  Verimation's customers can interconnect with OfficeVisionusing software from soft-Switch, based in Wayne, Pa.andM;Soft-Switch specializes in interconnecting different vendors' electronic mailsystems.andM;&quot;We announced a relationship with IBM last December,&quot; said Don Fisher, vicepresident of services in applications marketing for Soft-Switch.andP;  &quot;As aresult, IBM sells Soft-Switch as its multivendor office products connectivitysolution.&quot;andM;Soft-Switch will also be expanding its technical relationship with IBM.andM;&quot;We will be providing direct support for OV/2, Release 2, during the firstquarter of 1991,&quot; said Fisher.andP;  &quot;Today, for an OV/2 LAN to communicate withanother vendor's electronic mail system, it has to go through IBM's DISOSS[Distributed Office Support Systems] office automation system for MVSmainframes, or connect through OfficeVision/VM.andP;  That is, the customer wouldhave to install one of the OfficeVision mainframe products or DISOSS.andM;&quot;We announced that we would provide direct support with Soft-Switchproducts,&quot; said Fisher.andP;  &quot;So, in the future, people will be able to keep Memoor another vendor's E-mail on their mainframe and connect to OfficeVision/2LANwithout installing DISOSS or OfficeVision/VM,&quot;andM;&quot;OfficeVision in many ways has redefined what office automation is allabout,&quot; said Sroczynski.andP;  &quot;The Gartner Group [a consulting firm in Stamfor,Conn.] likes to call it the third generation of electronic mail.'&quot;andM;Sroczynski said that if IBM made OfficeVision a closed system, IBM mightwin--but the customer would lose.andM;&quot;Third-party vendors, particularly in certain niches, have consistently beenable to create better and more efficient software than IBM has.andP;  That's whythere's such a big third-party software market today.&quot;andP;  He said customersbenefit because then they can pick the system they want.andP;  Just like selectingthe products they want in a supermarket.andP;  &quot;The interconnectivity is therenow,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;In the past, IBM didn't worry about connecting to other,&quot; said Sroczynski.andO;&quot;Others connected to them.andP;  In this new age that we're in, IBM realizes ithas to connect to others,&quot;andM;Integrating Applications with OfficeVisionandM;Vendors utilize SAA's common application interfaceandM;&quot;There's a lot of confusion in the marketplace about OfficeVision and SAA,&quot;said Don Fisher, vice president of services in applications marketing forSoft-Switch in Wayne, Pa., &quot;and IBM is working to eliminate that confusion.&quot;andM;Many customers think that if they go with OfficeVision or SAA, they have togo completely with Big Blue.andP;  While IBM might be just as happy if they did itthat way, that is not necessary.andM;A variety of products can work with OfficeVision and SAA.andP;  For example,Soft-Switch is providing E-mail interconnectivity capabilities.andM;Many vendors are working as IBM Business Partners to provide products thatintegrate with OfficeVision.andP;  But a software vendor does not need a formalrelationship with IBM.andP;  Many vendors are upgrading their vertical industryapplication software to integrate with OfficeVision.andM;American Management Systems in Arlington, Va., is doing just that.andP;  &quot;We havea number of products,&quot; said Jerrold Grochow, vice president of corporatetechnology for AMS, &quot;that deal with specific vertical industries, liketelecommunications, banking, state and local governments, etc.&quot;andP;  AMS isintegrating some of those applications with OfficeVisions.andM;&quot;We feel that will provide a more integrated application for our users,&quot; saidGrochow.andP;  &quot;A budgeting analyst, working with our budgeting application, canimmediately send an electronic mail message to someone with questions abouttheir budget.&quot;andM;Grochow said there are many ways to integrate functions.andP;  &quot;The analyst couldperhaps take a piece of a spreadsheet or the results of a database query andtie that directly into an application to make the whole process of doing hisjob smoother.andP;  So we see an advantage to tying in the OfficeVision from thepoint of view of providing better service to our customers.&quot;andM;Having other vendors integrate their products with OfficeVision is also an advantage to IBM.andP;  &quot;If they can say, 'Not only do we have a variety of officefunctions, but here are all these vendors who have integrated theirapplications with out office functions,' that makes their package that muchmore attractive.&quot;andM;Grochow's book, SAA:A Guide to Implementing IBM's System applicationArchitecture, will be published in September 1990 by Yourdon Press/PrenticeHall.andP;  In it, Grochow said OfficeVision is important as a major applicationsystem designed to take advantage of SAA.andM;OfficeVision is an &quot;architected&quot; product family, said Grochow.andP;  There is aninternal structure that emphasizes commonality and extendibility.andP;  Programfunctions, he said, have been grouped so that changes within a group can bemade independently of changes in other group.andM;&quot;IBM has built several levels of common functions on top of the CommonProgramming Interface provided by SAA,&quot; said Grochow.andP;  &quot;These levels definethe OfficeVision 'application platform,' which can be used by others inintegrating applications into the OfficeVision workplace, or in developingtheir own office applications.&quot;andM;There are various levels of integration that are possible with OfficeVision.andO;There is a simple integration where an application just appears on theOfficeVision menu.andP;  When the icon representing that application is selected,control is transferred to that application.andM;There is a tighter integration that brings more functionality.andP;  In thetighter integration, explained Grochow, &quot;some of the office functions appearon the menu in your application.andP;  That requires your application to call theOfficeVision APIs.andP;  And that is what we and a number of other vendorsandM;Bochenski is a high-tech freelance writer and DP professional who lives inBellevue, Wash.andP;
