Lenders last week were asking on average a 10.61% interest rate on 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgages, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. That was little changed from the 10.6% rate of one month earlier, but above the 9.37% rate of a year earlier. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.    &quot;We've got stability,&quot; said Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers' Association. &quot;There's stability in (housing) sales and starts and hopefully in interest rates. I don't see any reason for thinking we're going to have any wild fluctuations.&quot;    According to the Freddie Mac survey, lenders last week were asking, on average, an initial interest rate of 7.95% on 30-year, conventional adjustable-rate mortgages with rates tied to one-year Treasury notes.    A separate survey by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board reflected the downward trend in interest rates that began with the Oct. 19 stock market crash. The Bank Board said lenders in early December were asking an average effective interest rate of 11.07% on conventional fixed-rate mortgages, down from 11.19% in early November, and a 8.94% average effective rate on 30-year adjustable-rate loans that have restrictions on rate increases, down from 8.98% in early November.    The figures apply to single-family home mortgages maturing in 25 years or more. Adjustable-rate mortgages made up 68% of all loans closed in early December, up from 65% a month earlier.    The Bank Board also said the average purchase price of a new home rose to a record $145,700 in early December, compared with $135,900 in early November. The latest figure exceeded the $145,300 record set in October 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
