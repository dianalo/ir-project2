The patient, a 52-year-oldman, complained of dizziness on walking. He initially refused to undergonemyelography, but 4 months later, underwent MRI test, which lead to thediagnosis of Arnold-Chiari malformation (I type). Not all patients withsymptoms of Arnold-Chiari malformation, syringomyelia, syringobulbiaand cervical spinal tumor, undergone myelography, which is an invasivetechnique, therefore MRI should be the first examination for the patientswith disorders involving the craniocervical junction.</TEXT></DOC>
