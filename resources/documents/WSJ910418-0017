Oswald, executive vice president and chieffinancial officer, said at the annual meeting that he expectsfirst-quarter earnings of $48 million, or 95 cents a share,compared with $47.6 million, or $1.04 a share, a yearearlier.   Depressed gas prices and the continuing impact of the warmweather, Mr. Oswald said, &quot;make it unlikely that 1991'searnings will be as high as 1990's.&quot; He said Columbia's gasdistribution business was hit particularly hard as customerswent to cheaper suppliers elsewhere.</TEXT></DOC>
