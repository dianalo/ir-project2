The missile earlier hit technical snags and cost run-ups, and some congressmen called for its cancellation. Air Force officials, however, say that recent test firings indicate that the weapon can hit its targets. The Amraam, which stands for advanced medium-range air-to-air missile, is one of the Pentagon's costliest systems. The Air Force and Navy expect to spend about $5.2 billion for 17,000 of them over the next decade.    The Defense Department's green light for the missile followed a review by the Defense Acquisition Board, which oversees the progress of major military projects. The board recommended that the Air Force move the program out of the development phase and award contracts to produce the first Amraam missiles for the Pentagon's inventory.    The Air Force will seek 180 missiles in the first production contracts. Based on competitive bids to be sought later this year, the Air Force will divide the Amraam orders between GM Hughes Electronics Corp., the subsidiary of Detroit-based GM that designed the missile, and Lexington, Mass.-based Raytheon. After the missile experienced huge cost overruns and technical problems, the Air Force last year brought in Raytheon as a second producer. Raytheon said it expects to make 75 of the 180 missiles, with Hughes making the remainder.    The Amraam, which uses radar guidance to home in on enemy aircraft too far away to see, still faces some critics on Capitol Hill. Rep. Denny Smith (R., Ore.), who helped kill the Divad air-defense gun, is one. According to his aides, Rep. Smith believes the system isn't ready to enter production because some of its parts haven't been refined.    More fundamentally, a briefing last month to the bipartisan military reform caucus maintained that longer-range, radar-guided missiles are among the least effective in combat. A survey of air-to-air combat in recent wars shows that most successful attacks employed heat-seeking missiles fired from close range.    Moreover, the study, conducted by retired Air Force Col. James Burton, a weapons analyst, found that aviators tend to prefer dogfights with enemy pilots, using short-range weapons.    The Air Force has staunchly defended the Amraam, arguing that longer-range radar-guided missiles will lessen the combat risks for pilots and aircraft. The Amraam will also be used by Navy pilots.    In contracts awarded last Friday, units of Boeing Co. won jobs totaling $256.5 million to develop anti-submarine warfare equipment for the Navy, and to provide cruise-missile mission-planning software and a space-launch vehicle study for the Air Force.    Units of Raytheon were awarded contracts totaling $89.8 million for Hawk missiles for the Army and space-satellite software for the Air Force.    Southwest Mobile Systems Corp., a unit of Emerson Electric Co., received a $22.9 million Air Force contract for aircraft cargo trucks.    Units of McDonnell Douglas Corp. were awarded Air Force contracts totaling $17.2 million for aircraft-weapon technology, a space-launch vehicle study and F-15 aircraft support equipment.    ---   LTV, Singer Seek Contract   BUFFALO, N.Y. -- LTV Corp.'s Missiles andamp; Electronics Group, based here, said its Sierra Research Division has agreed to join with Singer Co.'s HRB-Singer Division to pursue a U.S. Marine Corps contract that has a possible value of more than $300 million.    The unit of Dallas-based LTV said the contract is to develop and produce a part of the Marines' air command and control system, which coordinates air operations for the branch. If granted the contract, Sierra will be prime contractor, and HRBSinger will provide software for the system.    LTV is a steel, energy and aerospace concern, currently operating with protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. Stamford, Conn.-based Singer has defense and aerospace interests. </TEXT></DOC>
