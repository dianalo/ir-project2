The spectroscopy applied continuouswave dye laser induced fluorescence of free atoms at {lambda}=293.2 nmin a well collimated atomic beam. The 293.2 nm ultraviolet light wasgenerated by frequency doubling the output of a dye laser in either atemperature tuned Ammonium Dihydrogen Arsenate (ADA) crystal or an angletuned Lithium Iodate crystal. A special radio frequency (rf) techniquewas used to tune the dye laser frequency with long term stability. RadioactiveSr isotopes were produced either by neutron capture of stable strontiumor by ({alpha},xn) reactions from krypton gas. The samples were purifiedby an electromagnetic mass separator and their sizes were of order 100pg, which corresponds to 10/sup 11/ atoms. The observed results of thehyperfine structure components are evaluated in terms of nuclear magneticdipole moments and electric quadrupole moments. Changes in mean squarecharge radii of strontium nuclei which were extracted from the isotopeshift measurements, exhibit a distinct shell effect at the neutron magicnumber N=50. The experimental data are analysed and compared with sometheoretical nuclear model predictions. The strong increase of the nuclearcharge radii with decreasing neutron number of isotopes below N=50 isin agreement with the variation of the mean square deformation extractedfrom measured B(E2) values.</TEXT></DOC>
