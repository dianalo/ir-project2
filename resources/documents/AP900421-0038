Soccer fans and neo-Nazis were dispersed in East Berlin before aleftist group arrived from West Berlin to confront them. But theleftists themselves went on a rampage in West Berlin, lootingstores and hurling rocks.   Fifty-seven people were arrested, officials said.   Trouble started after a soccer match between FC Berlin and HansaRostock Friday in the eastern part of the divided city, where 300youths, some wearing masks, fought pitched battles in AlexanderPlatz, East Berlin's main square.   Some rioters shouted tributes to Adolf Hitler's 101st birthdayFriday and attacked passersby, police said.   The official East German news agency ADN said the mob alsostormed a homosexual bar screaming ``Gay's out.'' Amid cries of``You know it's Adolf Hitler's birthday,'' they smashed windows andransacked the club.   Witnesses said some of the club's 15 guests suffered minor cutsand bruises in the fray, ADN said. They were not, however, includedamong the injured.   An East German Interior Ministry statement said two people wereseriously hurt and four police sustained light injuries in theAlexander Platz fracas. An official of the FC Berlin soccer clubwas also badly hurt after being attacked.   The ministry said 30 youths were arrested.   Police said about 300 West Berlin leftists and foreign residentsgathered on the western side of the Wall after hearing radioreports of the violence, then moved into East Berlin to confrontthe thugs.   Police said the group returned to West Berlin within an hourafter discovering the opposing group had already been dispersed.   ``As they did not meet any right-wing extremists, they came backto vent their fury here,'' said West Berlin police spokesman HeinzWiedemann.   The leftists hurled stones and bottles at police, built streetbarricades and smashed shop and car windows. He said at least threestores were looted in West Berlin's Kreuzberg district, he said.
