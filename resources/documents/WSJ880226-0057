But the plan, which appears likely to reduce the Mexican government's $53 billion in foreign bank debt by between $2 billion and $3 billion, probably will fall far short of earlier expectations that Mexico's debt might be cut by as much as $10 billion.    Under the plan, devised by Mexican officials and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. -- one of Mexico's biggest creditors -- Mexico is offering to swap as much as $10 billion of new, 20-year bonds for bank loans. To get the new bonds, which offer a higher interest margin than existing Mexican government bank debt, banks must tender their Mexican loans at a discount. The offering period ends today at 4 p.m. EST.    To enhance the credit-worthiness of its bonds, Mexico is backing them with 20-year zero-coupon bonds it is buying from the U.S. Treasury. Zero-coupon bonds pay interest only at maturity.    Deutsche Bank AG and Swiss Bank Corp. said they are joining Morgan in exchanging debt for new bonds. Meanwhile, some U.S. regionals, and other Swiss and German banks have indicated they also are tendering their debts, banking sources said. They include Boston-based Bank of New England, Dresdner Bank AG and Credit Suisse. Some Japanese banks, which can get tax benefits from realizing losses on their Mexican debts, also are expected to participate.    Most large U.S. banks, such as Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp., are shunning the plan, saying it is aimed at banks that want to stop lending to Mexico. But some smaller and regional U.S. banks are tendering debt at prices that should be attractive to the Mexicans, bankers said. Morgan, which is agent for the plan, is expected to tender about $500 million of its $1.1 billion Mexican debt.    &quot;I think there's been a real turnaround in perception. People have become more positive&quot; about the plan, said Ken Hoffman, who trades Mexican and other developing-country loans for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Mr. Hoffman said he believes the Mexican plan could replace as much as $7 billion of debt with as much as $5 billion in new bonds.    Despite the bank bids, exactly how much of Mexico's old bank debt gets exchanged at a discount for new bonds still depends on Mexican Finance Minister Gustavo Petricioli. Under the terms of the plan, announced Dec. 29, Mexico has five business days after the offering period closes today to decide how much it will pay for its old bank debt.    Some big British banks aren't expected to take part. Sir Kit McMahon, chairman of Midland Bank PLC, expressed his doubts about the plan at a recent news conference. &quot;I don't think the arithmetic is terribly good. It's better for Mexico than it is for the banks,&quot; he said.    But there are takers for the plan in continental Europe, where major banks have reserved for losses of as much as 70% on Mexican and other Third World loans. That compares with levels of 25% to 30% among big U.S. and British banks.    Reserving enables banks to absorb losses on bad credits. If a bank has a high loan-loss provision, it could recoup some of its loss if it sold its loans to Mexico for less than what it had reserved. For example, a bank with a 70% reserve would &quot;profit&quot; if it sold its loans to Mexico for 60% of face value.    Deutsche Bank announced last September that it made loan-loss provisions covering 70% of its problem-country debt. Although it will bid for the Mexican bonds, a spokesman declined to say at what discount or for how many bonds the bank will bid.    In Tokyo, Japanese bankers were reluctant to give details on their strategies for bidding in the debt auction. &quot;We are watching what everyone else is doing. We haven't decided anything yet,&quot; said one executive in charge of Latin American lending at a major bank.    But Tokyo analysts said they expect Japanese banks to participate. &quot;I don't think they will risk damaging their international reputation,&quot; said Robert Zielinski, of Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. Analysts said they thought Japanese banks would accept as much as a 30% discount.    There are tax advantages for the Japanese in participating. They can get tax breaks for writing off some of their loans and for any losses on the sale of Mexican debt. The Ministry of Finance also will permit banks to maintain at face value any remaining Mexican debt.    Whatever Japanese banks decide, it appears unlikely that one bank will try to go it alone. &quot;If you don't go along with a group and you make the wrong decision, it will be hard to explain to your superiors later,&quot; explained one banker.    Meantime, Mexican officials declined to judge how creditors would respond. &quot;It really is a completely new instrument. We think it's an attractive option for some banks. Some may not be in a position to take advantage of it,&quot; said Mexico's director of public credit, Angel Gurria.    (Revised WSJ Feb. 29, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
