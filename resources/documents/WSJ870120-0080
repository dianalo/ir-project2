SchlesingerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> OITENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)PULP, PAPER, PACKAGING (ALL TYPES) (PUL) </IN><TEXT>   Owens-Illinois Inc., reacting to the pressure of a $3.2 billion bid for the company by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc., said it would meet with Kohlberg Kravis and any other interested suitors to discuss the sale of the company.    Wall Street sources familiar with the company's decision said the Owens-Illinois board had essentially resigned itself to auctioning off the company.    Based in Toledo, Ohio, Owens-Illinois makes containers and packages, and owns nursing homes and a mortgage banking company.    Shares of Owens-Illinois climbed rapidly after the company announced its intentions yesterday afternoon, closing at $59, up $3.50, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Takeover speculators, faced recently with a dearth of trading opportunities, have been pouring money into the stock. Several said yesterday that if a bidding contest for the company develops, the final per-share price could be in the range of $62 to $65.    The decision to meet with Kohlberg Kravis and any other interested parties is an about-face from the stance the company's board adopted Jan. 12, when it rejected a $55-a-share bid by Kohlberg Kravis, refused to meet with the New York investment firm, and instead unveiled its own restructuring plan to enhance shareholder values.    Kohlberg Kravis countered the same day with a sweetened $60-a-share bid. As reported earlier, Wall Street sources said the board was sharply divided over Kohlberg Kravis's overtures, with management directors in favor of exploring a possible buyout led by Kohlberg Kravis, and some outside directors adamantly opposed to any transaction that would end Owens-Illinois' status as an independent public company.    According to Wall Street sources, the outside directors concluded reluctantly that a sale of the company was inevitable once the bidding had reached the $60-a-share level, based on advice by the company's financial advisers, Lazard Freres andamp; Co. and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. A special committee of the board, which had recommended rejection of the earlier bid, also received advice from Dillon, Read andamp; Co.    A spokeswoman for Kohlberg Kravis said the firm's partners were unavailable for comment.    Kohlberg Kravis specializes in leveraged buyouts, in which it takes a company private with the aid of loans from banks and other institutions. The arrangements often include management as equity participants. In its initial offer for Owens-Illinois, Kohlberg Kravis said management would be offered an equity stake, but it dropped that provision from its $60-a-share offer. Wall Street sources said, however, that management still might be included in a Kohlberg Kravis-led buyout. Kohlberg Kravis has said it will finance the cash portion of its offer with bank loans, and that no debt securities would be involved.    Owens-Illinois' one-sentence prepared statement said the company &quot;intended to hold discussions&quot; with Kohlberg Kravis, &quot;as well as with other parties who have expressed or may express an interest in acquiring Owens-Illinois.&quot; A spokesman declined to say whether the company had received other offers, or to answer any questions about the statement.    Owens-Illinois' investment bankers wouldn't say who besides Kohlberg Kravis might be interested in acquiring the company. Wall Street sources said the company has received inquiries and expressions of interest, though no formal bids, from other financial concerns interested in a competing leveraged buyout bid, and from industrial companies. Those approaches weren't pursued while the board was still trying to ward off a sale, the sources said, but will be now.    One name making the rounds on Wall Street yesterday was Britain's Hanson Trust PLC, the conglomerate that has said it is looking for a major acquisition in the U.S. A Hanson spokesman denied that the company is interested in Owens-Illinois.    While a bidding battle could ensue, some analysts expressed skepticism that the price would go much higher than the $60-a-share offer. &quot;It seems curious,&quot; said Arthur M. Stupay, of Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben in Cleveland. &quot;I don't know if you want to pay big bucks for some of those divisions. Some of them are in limited-growth areas.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
