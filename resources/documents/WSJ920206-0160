Harsco expects to weather reductions in defense spendingthis year and next as a result of sizable order backlogs formilitary trucks and tank-like tracked vehicles. More thanhalf the orders are from overseas governments, includingSaudi Arabia, South Korea, Egypt and Taiwan. Mr. Gambillsaid, &quot;The market thinks poorly of defense stocks, and themultiples are bad, but we're not affected that much.&quot;   Harsco's defense unit is involved in pending legal mattersthat, if resolved this year, could affect 1992 results. Theseinclude a $62 million dispute with the Army over payment offederal excise taxes and $125 million of claims Harsco filedalleging defects in government contracts.   Mr. Gambill said Harsco is completing three years of jobcuts at its York, Pa., tracked vehicle plant as a result of adropoff in orders.
