(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The top judges in Connecticut's federaldistrict, state Supreme Court and state Appellate Court are women,but the members of this unique judicial troika say women still haveground to make up.   Ellen Bree Burns is chief judge for the U.S. District Court inConnecticut, Ellen Ash Peters is chief justice of the state SupremeCourt and Antoinette L. Dupont is chief judge of the Appellate Court.   The state attorney general also is a woman. Clarine Nardi Riddlewas promoted to acting attorney general when her former boss, JosephLieberman, won a U.S. Senate seat in November.   No other state has a similar combination of top female jurists,and the judges say the distinction underscores not how far womenhave come, but how far they have to go.   ``Overall, one can't be overjoyed by the fact that a few of us dohave positions that are conspicuous,'' said Peters, 58, who wasappointed to the Supreme Court in 1978 and became chief justice in1984.   ``There's more to be done and the fact that I'm the chiefjustice, Antoinette Dupont is the chief judge in the AppellateCourt, Ellen Bree Burns is the chief judge in the federal districtand Clarine Nardi Riddle is attorney general, doesn't mean it'sover.''   The country's only other female state Supreme Court chief justiceis Dorothy Comstock Riley in Michigan.   In the federal system, Judith W. Rogers serves as chief judge forthe District of Columbia Court of Appeals.   Of the state appellate courts, only Dupont serves as a chiefjudge, said Philip A. Lattimore, staff director for the NationalAssociation of Women Judges in Williamsburg, Va.   Nationally, 1,200 of 25,000 state judges are women. These include30 women supreme court justices and 66 appellate judges, Lattimoresaid.   ``We are at a point in our history where women are entering thestate courts of last resort (supreme courts),'' he said.   The ranks of female jurists is bound to increase because abouthalf of the students in law schools now are women, Lattimore said.   Elaine Martin, an assistant political science professor atEastern Michigan State University, said women are bringing a freshperspective to courtrooms.   ``Some say they are more compassionate and others say they aremore attuned to gender bias,'' said Martin, who has a $10,000 grantfrom the American Center for Women in Politics to study theinfluence of women in the nation's state supreme courts.   A state task force is preparing a report on gender bias inConnecticut courts based on testimony gathered during publichearings last year.   The report is expected to cite examples of bias including maleattorneys frequently addressing female witnesses by their firstnames while being more formal with male witnesses.   Members of the General Assembly's Judiciary Committee have askedfemale judicial candidates whether their family life would interferewith judicial affairs. One candidate was asked if she would be ableto meet mortgage payments on a judge's salary.   The three judges say signs of continuing gender bias don'tsuprise them. They saw plenty while breaking into the legalprofession in the 1950s.   ``You were often told: `We don't hire women because our clientsdon't like women lawyers,''' said 60-year-old Dupont, recalling herdays as an attorney in New York City.   Burns, 65, recalled the cold reception she got at lawyers'function years ago.   ``I went to a New Haven County Bar Association meeting and theytold me I was in the wrong place,'' she said. ``I assured them thatif this was a bar association meeting, then I was in the rightplace.''</TEXT></DOC>
