Analysts credited a four-year economic boom and confidence inthe future as helping push the Socialist Party over the top inSunday's general elections.   However, they said, the governing party's majority was sharplyreduced because organized labor was angry over Gonzalez'spro-business policies and unwillingness to further boost socialspending.   The man who first rose to power in 1982 has helped give SpainEurope's fastest growing economy.   In Sunday's balloting, the Socialists won 176 seats, or 39.55percent of the vote, the minimum needed for a majority of the 350seats in Parliament's powerful lower house. They had won 184 seatsin 1986 elections.   The biggest gains were won by the United Left coalition thatincludes the Communist Party, which increased its seats to 17, with9 percent of the vote, from the seven seats in 1986.   With all the votes counted, Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcueraalso announced these results early today in the Cortes, or lowerhouse: the conservative Popular Party, 106 seats, 25.83 percent ofthe vote; the Catalan Convergence and Union, 18 seats, 5 percent;the Democratic and Social Center of former prime minister AdolfoSuarez, 14 seats, 8 percent.   The remaining seats were divided among eight smaller parties.   The Popular Party under 36-year-old Jose Maria Aznar, aninexperienced former tax collector who took over just two monthsago, remained the largest opposition force. However, it gained justone seat in this election.   In the 208-seat Senate, the Socialists won 109 seats, thePopular Party 74, the Convergence and Union 10, the United Left 1and the Democratic and Social Center 3. The remaining seats went tothe smaller parties.   During the campaign, United Left leader Julio Anguita hammeredaway at the Socialists, saying they had failed to distribute fairlythe benefits of the country's newly generated wealth.   The Communists won 20 seats in 1977 general elections after thedeath two years earlier of Gen. Francisco Franco and Spain's returnto democracy. However, they had suffered a constant decline untilSunday's vote.   Gonzalez, a 47-year-old former labor lawyer and undergroundpolitical activist during the Franco era, has provided the countrywith firm leadership, guiding it out of near bankruptcy in 1982 tosolvency and a starring role in the 12-nation European Community.   ``With these results, it is possible to govern (alone),'' theprime minister said, ``and we're going to do it with the same hopeand democratic attitude we've shown since 1982,'' when he swept tovictory with a landslide.   Analysts said the United Left coalition won the protest vote bythrowing support behind the nation's two largest unions in theirbitter battle with the government for greater spending on pensions,unemployment insurance and wages for civil servants.   The coalition went from fewer than 1 million votes in 1986 to1.8 million votes Sunday, apparently snapping up the 900,000 votesthat the Socialists lost, according to electoral experts.   However, Economy Minister Carlos Solchaga quickly dismissed anynotion that the coalition would influence the Socialists to moveaway from the pro-business policies that have contributed toSpain's average growth rate of 4.5 percent over the past fouryears, the highest in Europe.   He said the Socialist government ``needs no leftward swing orallies.''   Inflation dropped from 14 percent in 1982 to 5 percent lastyear, although it is now running at 7 percent.   ``Despite the drop in votes, any way one looks at the thirdSocialist majority, it appears to be further confirmation that theSpanish society sees Gonzalez as its best leader,'' said veteranpolitical comentator Pedro Altares.   Spain is the third European country, after Sweden and Austria,to witness three successive terms of Socialist majority governments.   The 69.9 percent turnout rate among the nation's 29.5 millionregistered voters was up slightly from the 68.9 percent in the 1986elections. But it was significantly lower than the 80 percent inthe 1982 contest.</TEXT></DOC>
