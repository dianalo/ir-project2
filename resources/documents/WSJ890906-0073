The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up only 0.08 to 471.42, disappointing investors and traders who had hoped for a stronger start after the holiday weekend. By comparison, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped 0.3%.    Volume was a little slow, with 121.1 million shares changing hands. Advancing OTC issues finished narrowly ahead of those that declined, 943 to 937.    &quot;Everybody was expecting to come back from the Labor Day weekend and see some type of explosive market, and that didn't happen,&quot; lamented Len Hefter, head of Jefferies andamp; Co.'s OTC trading desk in Dallas.    Traders said concern over the future of interest rates soured the market. An article in this newspaper yesterday said that, for the first time in months, the presidents of a few regional Federal Reserve banks may be ready to consider raising rates again to suppress inflation. Recent economic reports have shown that the economy hasn't slowed as sharply as earlier believed.    Mr. Hefter and Robert O'Toole Sr., head of institutional OTC trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said the report triggered some selling. Mr. Hefter worried that &quot;if {the Federal Reserve} were to raise rates, that would kill the market dead in its tracks.&quot; But, he added that the market appears to have some underlying strength, and that most investors are assuming that rates won't go up.    Nasdaq's biotechnology stocks, subjects of recent articles in this newspaper and the New York Times, surged in active trading. Amgen jumped 1 5/8 to 41 1/4 on 324,300; Genetics Institute rose 1 to 28 1/4 on 84,700 shares, and Biogen gained 3/8 to 13 7/8 on 231,000 shares. On 277,200 shares, Chiron rose 3/8 to 25 1/8, while Xoma gained 1/2 to 20 3/4 on 159,300 shares. Centocor improved 1/2 to 19 1/4 on 52,200 shares, and Cetus added 1/4 to 16 5/8 on 355,800 shares.    The Nasdaq 100 Index, which includes Cetus and 99 other nonindustrial issues, rose 0.13 to 447.16. For the year, the index is up about 26%. The Nasdaq Financial Index, which has risen about 28% this year, slipped a bit. It finished off 0.02 to 468.26.    Profit-taking drove cellular stocks down from their Friday advance, traders said.    LIN Broadcasting dropped 1 1/2 to 107, McCaw Cellular Communications dropped 1 to 39 and Cellular Communication was down 5/8 to 39 1/4. The Nasdaq Utility Index, which includes those issues, dropped 2.82 to 743.10.    Another utility stock, MCI Communications, got a lift yesterday after Moody's Investors Service said it may upgrade the ratings on MCI's subordinated notes. The stock headed Nasdaq's most-active list with a gain of 3/8 to 39 1/4 on 1.9 million shares.    Moody's said the review of the ratings was &quot;prompted by the likelihood that MCI will continue to generate improving cash flow and profitability.&quot; The rating agency said MCI's strong earnings have recently enabled the company to strengthen its capital structure, and prospects for future profits could permit further improvements.    The Nasdaq Transportation Index was the OTC market's strongest sector, on a percentage basis, rising 2.68 to 470.48. Traders said talk that either Yellow Freight or Roadway Services, two of the index's biggest stocks, may be added to the Dow Jones Transportation Index helped boost the group.    Traders said the stocks would benefit because any index funds tied to the Dow Transports would be obliged to add positions in those stocks to their portfolios. Yellow Freight gained 1/8 to 31 5/8, and Roadway added 1/8 to 39.    Kirschner Medical ended with a gain of 1 1/2 at 24 1/2, after rising as much as 1 3/4 during yesterday's trading. Last Thursday, Alex. Brown issued a report on the company and repeated its recommendation that investors buy the stock, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.    Optical Radiation rose 1 to 21 3/4. Montgomery Securities was a heavy buyer of the stock, according to Professional Investor Report. Montgomery has recently recommended buying the stock.    A reference in Barron's boosted the stock of First Federal Savings Bank of Montana. The issue jumped 1 1/4 to 12 1/4. First Federal boasts some of the highest performance ratios in the business and might be a takeover target, according to Barron's. The publication noted, however, that the company hasn't yet been approached.    Base Ten Systems gained 3/4 to 4 1/2 after the electronics concern reported earnings from continuing operations of $920,000 for its third quarter ended July 31. For the year-earlier period, the company reported a loss from continuing operations. Base Ten's revenue grew about 23% in the latest quarter from a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
