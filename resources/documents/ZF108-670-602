(DEC) and IBMhosts, according to officials at the Waltham, Mass., company.andM;The other package, called Document Control Software (DCS), is a trimmed-downversion of CMS that only allows access to Oracle files on Sun workstations orDOS PCs, they said.andM;Both programs alleviate the burden for users to know where a particularOracle file is located.andP;  In addition, the software's menu-driven,point-and-shoot orientation makes query tasks easier than they are withOracle's own method, according to users.andM;&quot;CMS makes Oracle [databases] make more sense,&quot; said Jim Holland, a CADsystems coordinator at the Esab Group of North America Inc., a welding partsmanufacturer in Florence, S.C.andP;  The company is using CMS to give engineersaccess to 60,000 documents that are dispersed in Oracle databases on SunSPARCstations, DOS PCs and an IBM mainframe.andM;&quot;[CMS] unifies the [Oracle] databases on different platforms and makes iteasier to find documents in the database,&quot; Holland said.andM;Both CMS and DCS incorporate a system that allows users to save relateddatabase files in personal folders for more efficient access, according toJames Carney, president of Workgroup Technologies.andM;In addition, the new software programs have a built-in, low-levelelectronic-mail system, he said.andM;To help network managers do their jobs, Workgroup Technologies' softwaredelivers several administration tools, including a file-backup utility and asecurity mechanism that can be tapped to restrict users from accessingdesignated files, according to Carney.andM;Both CMS and DCS are available now from Workgroup Technologies.andM;The Configuration Management Systems software is priced at $19,500, plus$4,000 for training and installation.andM;Pricing for the Document Control Software is $4,000, with an additional$1,000 for training and installation.andM;Workgroup Technologies can be contacted at (617) 895-1500.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
