Relisys has a sound solution.andP;  As a representative explains, &quot;Youoffer more: quality monitors, good prices, and outstanding service.&quot;andO;According to our survey, Relisys delivers just that.andP;  Stable on reliabilityand customer loyalty, Relisys monitors score a significant 17 points aboveaverage in terms of satisfaction with all sources of technical support, and 9points above average for repair service.andM;Our survey responses reflect almost unbeatable performance by the technicalsupport department at Relisys.andP;  At most of the places where surveyrespondents have turned looking for technical support for their Relisysmonitors-the manufacturer, a retailer, or an in-house department-they got thehelp they needed, and they seem highly satisfied with the results.andP;  Fivesurvey respondents used Relisys's technical support department, and all ofthem give it the highest possible rating.andP;  Six respondents consulted theirretailers, and four of them give retailers the highest satisfaction rating,while another gives it the next highest.andP;  One respondent went to an in-housedepartment for support and gives it the highest rating.andM;Out of the 121 respondents who use Relisys monitors, only 15 report everhaving had even one problem with those monitors.andP;  Sergeant John Davis, who isstationed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, is a case in point.andP;  Davis has ownedhis Relisys monitor for a year and hasn't had reason to complain about itsperformance yet.andP;  &quot;The price was reasonable, it displays with no problem, andthe text is very legible, very sharp,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Even though my monitor isonly designed to display 800 by 600 resolution, I've displayed graphics andtext up to 1,024 by 768, and it did the job quite acceptably.andP;  Davis alsonotes that his monitor is so reliable that he hasn't needed to call Relisysfor technical support thus far.andM;Dr.andP;  Ronald A. Burnett, director and CEO of New Horizons Institute inSpringfield, Missouri, likewise praises his Relisys monitor for itsdependable, steady performance.andP;  &quot;It's excellent,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;I've had noproblems whatsoever.andP;  I've had other monitors, and they all gave me trouble.andO;But I've had my Relisys for over a year, and I've never once had to calltechnical support.&quot; Although primarily an educator, Burnett also does somecomputer consulting work and recommends Relisys monitors to his clients.andP;  Heplans to buy another Relisys soon.andP;  &quot;They've proven themselves as far as I'mconcerned,&quot; he says.andM;According to Relisys, producing reliable products and offering helpfulservice are necessities for keeping up with the market, particularly thehigher-resolution color monitor market.andP;  &quot; We manufacture our own monitors,so we can maintain close scrutiny.andP;  When something goes awry, our entirechain of command goes on alert.andP;  We solve the problem before the productleaves our supervision.&quot;andM;For support after the product goes out the door, Relisys provides severaloptions.andP;  &quot;Our policy is to send end users either to their dealers for repairservice or to the place from which they bought their monitors,&quot; says aspokesperson.andP;  &quot;We have been known, however, to repair some warranty-coveredmonitors for end users, especially if their dealers have moved or gone out ofbusiness.&quot;andM;Relisys also maintains a toll-free hot line for technical support; the phonesare answered from 11:00 A.M.andP;  to 8:00 P.M.andP;  Eastern Standard Time.andP;  SinceRelisys also provides monitors for a number of OEM companies, the companywhose label is affixed to the monitor usually performs repair service for it.andO;But if an OEM that bundles Relisys monitors has trouble with them, it cansend the broken monitors back to Relisys for repairs.andM;Overall, Relisys fares well on our survey.andP;  The solid reliability of itsmonitors and the loyalty of its customers, along with the excellent ratingsfor technical support and repair service, reflect the company's attitudetowards its products.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
