Yost Jr., said his agency's management recognizes the need forchange.andP;  He said the Cosst Guard is modernizing or replacing major computersystems.andM;Most of the new systems will not be in operation until the mid-1990s, thereport said.andM;GAO identified five Coast Guard systems and five problems associated withthose systems.andP;  The systems are the Aircraft Repair and Supply Center System,the Law Enforcement Information System (LEIS), the Search and Rescue DatabaseSystem, the Marine Safety Information System and the Personnel AssignmentManagement Information System.andM;All five have data integrity problems, the report said.andP;  Information isunreliable or redundant because of limited error checking or validationcontrols, inadequate user procedures and lack of systems integration.andP;  Thesystems have limited data query capability, obsolete hardware and software,and responsiveness and reliability problems.andM;GAO also identified several key weaknesses in Coast Guard informationmanagement including a lack of top-level information resources managementleadership and planning, the absence of a long-range strategic plan and alack of IRM policies, standards and procedures.andM;JayEtta Z. Hecker, director of resources, community and economic developmentinformation systems in GAO's Information Management and Technology Division,told the House Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Navigation in April thatinadequacies in information systems contributed to difficulties in respondingto last year's Alaska oil spill.andM;&quot;In the Exxon Valdez incident, the lack of such information contributed tothe Coast Guard's inability to respond effectively,&quot; Hecker said.andM;As another example of how systems fail to support the agency, Hecker said theCoast Guard's law enforcement units, which use the LEIS, lack timely accessto information necessary to make tactical decisions supporting druginterdiction and vessel inspection boardings.andM;In addition, Coast Guard headquarters is forced to rekey into its own systeminformation mailed from its field offices, she said.andM;Yost took issue with GAO's claim that top-level management has &quot;absenteditself from IRM planning, guidance and direction.&quot;andP;  Although he agreed thatthe agency needed to develop a long-range strategic plan, he took issue withGAO's conclusion that agency officials do not have a vision for theintegration of IRM throughout the Coast Guard.andM;&quot;In the past six years the Coast Guard has spent over half a billion dollarsdeveloping and operating its information systems,&quot; Hecker told thesubcommittee.andP;  &quot;Yet, despite this investment, system supporting criticalCoast Guard missions cannot provide the information needed to effectivelyperform program operations.&quot;andM;Coast Guard officials are in the process of replacing or enhancing many ofits systems, as well as developing several new ones.andP;  Of eight selectedsystems projects whose total cost is $70 million, GAO found some are beingmanaged better than others.andM;The eight systems are the Acquisition Management Information System, theAviation Maintenance Management Information System, the Corporate Data Base(CDB), the Law Enforcement Information System II (LEIS II), the Marine SafetyInformation System II (MSIS II), the Personnel Data Decision System, theSearch and Rescue Management Information System (SARAMIS), and the VesselIdentification Information System (VIIS).andM;GAO auditors found incomplete documentation for project developmentschedules, cost estimates or system deliveries for the CDB, SARMIS and LEISII projects, they said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
