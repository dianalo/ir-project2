Congress is actively consideringacid rain legislation and the Administration and Congress are consideringamendments to the Clean Air Act. The courts have stated that atmosphericdispersion, &quot;Tall Stacks,&quot; cannot be used as an SO/sub 2/ control measureto achieve ambient air SO/sub 2/ standards. The trend of these actionsis to lower SO/sub 2/ emission limits for existing boilers.
