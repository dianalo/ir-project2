The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issuedthat ruling Tuesday in turning down a petition attacking the lower1986 standards. The petition was filed by the state of California,the cities of New York and Los Angeles, and four public issuesgroups.   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's``consideration of the likelihood of economic hardship within itsassessment of `economic practicability' must be given due weight,''the court said in an opinion by Judge Ruth Ginsburg.   The agency's decision was based on an analysis that concludedthe higher standard would have severe economic effects throughoutthe auto industry, and therefore was not arbitrary or capricious asthe petitioners alleged, the court said.   NHTSA lowered the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE,standard automakers must meet in 1986 from the 27.5 mpg set byCongress to 26 mpg. Standards for 1987 and 1988 were also loweredto 26 mpg.   Petitions also have been filed asking for review of the 1987 and1988 standards. Con Hitchcock, an attorney for the public issuesgroups, said they would reevaluate the petitions for 1987 and 1988in light of the court's ruling.   Although Congress set the standard at the higher level, it alsoallowed NHTSA to set lower standards after considering economicpracticality, technological feasibility, the effect of other motorvehicle standards, and the nation's need to conserve energy.   The court rejected the petitioners' assertion that NHTSA failedto consider energy conservation in adopting the lower standards.   The agency had weighed increased fuel consumption againsteconomic harm under broad guidelines set by Congress.   ``Had Congress offered a more precise balancing formula for theagency to apply, ... we could more confidently discern the agency'scompliance with the congressional mandate,'' the court said.   Lacking precise standards, NHTSA properly accommodatedconflicting policies in lowering the standard, the court said.   Judge Abner Mikva joined Judge Ginsbug in the majority. JudgeLawrence Silberman dissented in part.   Public issues groups joining in the petition were PublicCitizen, the Center for Auto Safety, the Union of ConcernedScientists and the Environmental Policy Institute.</TEXT></DOC>
