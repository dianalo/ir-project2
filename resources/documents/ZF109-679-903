(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>What You'll Find on Our CompuServe ForumandM;Until just a few weeks ago, Date Based Advisor was merely the &quot;must-read&quot;trade monthly for database developers, and I was merely another loyal DBAsubsciber and avid CompuServe user.andP;  I mention Data Based Advisor andCompuServe together, but until recently, the two weren't related nor did theycomplement one another in any obvious way.andP;  Then, in October, the magazinebegan sponsoring a Forum on CompuServe Information Service (CIS).andP;  I thinkyou'll find that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.andM;I'm a sysop on the DBA Forum.andP;  it will be my job, once a month, to bring yousome of the highlights from the electronic side of the magazine.andP;  NAturally,the topics of conversation on our Forum will primarily revolve around issuesthat Data Based Advisor has dealth with in print.andP;  This page will make thefeedback loop complete, as I bring highlights of the electronic forum back tothe print side, where it can reach those of you who have not yet wanderedinto our little moderm village.andM;How we're set upandM;We've organized the Forum into areas by broad topic, some of which relate tothe topics covered by Data Based Advisor, and some much better suited to themedium of CompuServe.andP;  Unlike a magazine, where a multi-month lead time is aconstant frustration, CompuServe is instantaneous.andP;  Each message topic areahas a library associated with it where files will be stored for your access.andM;Liberary 10, Download DBA Source, is where the source code published in eachissue is available for download.andP;  We currently have the source from January1989 and later on-line.andP;  You can get earlier files simply by requesting themfrom us.andP;  Leave a message to &quot;Sysop.&quot;andM;File of the monthandM;Other files availab le for download are contributed by the membership.andP;  Forinstance, this month, you should check out a shareware marketing system thatis itself marketed as shareware.andM;It includes a DBF-format mailing list (ov er 1M in size) of sharewaredistributors and BBS systems to which copies of your shareware product shouldbe sent.andP;  The unique thing about this databes is that the entries are ratedfor performance.andP;  You can conserve your budget by restricting distribution tothe top-of-the-line outlets, or go for saturation.andP;  You'll also find textfiles with marketing tips and experiences from other sharewares publishers.andM;Registration is $10 to get the next quarterly update, or $30 to get the nextfour updates.andP;  The author also solicits more tips and stories to build up thecollection in the file.andP;  See the file SMWI90.ZIP in Lib 6.andM;How to save moneyandM;CompuServ e is a time-charged service (you pay for ev ery minute you'reonline--with a few exceptions), so it's important to use it efficiently toreduce your costs.andP;  A number of specialized communications products automatethe online processes allowing you to read and reply to messages off-line(where it's free!).andP;  This can reduce the amount of money you spend accesssingour Forum, believe it or not, by 75 percent or more.andM;The most popular package among Forum regulars is TapCis, available fordownload from the TapCis Forum Library 1.andP;  Other software programs you mightconsider are AutoSig and CIM.andP;  I'm currently working on a comparative reviewof these packages for a future article.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
