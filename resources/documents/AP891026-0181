In a written statement, Bush reiterated his belief that aconstitutional amendment is the only way to ensure that the flag isprotected.   The law, which will take effect at one minute after midnightFriday, provides a prison term of up to a year for anyone who``knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns,maintains on the floor or ground or tramples upon'' any U.S. flag.   ``While I commend the intentions of those who voted for thisbill, I have serious doubts that it can withstand Supreme Courtreview,'' Bush said.   He said the Supreme Court has held ``that the government'sinterest in preserving the flag as a symbol can never be compellingenough to justify prohibiting flag desecration that is intended toexpress a message. Since that is precisely the target of thisbill's prohibition, I suspect that any subsequent court challengewill reach a similar conclusion.''</TEXT></DOC>
