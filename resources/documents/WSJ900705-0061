But analysts, and even company officials, said the newmachine would do little to boost the company's tiny share ofthe world mainframe market, as the Japanese company stillclings to its own exclusive architecture, for whichrelatively little software is available.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's going to be tough for them to make inroads,&quot; saidSteven W. Myers, a technology analyst with the Tokyo officeof Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. &quot;I question whetherperformance alone is enough.&quot;   Hiroshi Hatta, general manager of product planning forNEC's information processing unit, added: &quot;We don't have anypositive plans to market this machine overseas.&quot; He explainedthat &quot;our machine is not compatible with {InternationalBusiness Machines Corp.}, and in the U.S. the market forIBM-compatible machines is very, very large.&quot;   Yesterday's NEC announcement comes a month after HitachiLtd. first showed its new generation mainframe, which it saidat the time was the fastest available. Industry officialstake the Hitachi announcement much more seriously, however,as its machines are based on IBM's architecture, theindustry's prevailing standard.   Fujitsu Ltd., which also makes IBM-compatible machines,and IBM itself, are expected to announce their nextgeneration machines within the next few quarters. AlthoughNEC has started taking orders for the machine, it won't beginshipping units for nine months.   NEC said its ACOS 3800 machine can compute 100 millioninstructions a second (mips) on one processor, and 500 mipswith six processors. Comparisons between companies aredifficult because they use different structures. But Mr.Hatta said that NEC's machine could run 360 mips with fourprocessors, compared with 210 mips for Hitachi'sfour-processor configuration.   Mr. Hatta said NEC could accomplish the high-processingspeed because of its advanced semiconductor technology. &quot;Thelarge-scale integration we're using on this machine isbasically the same technology we're using on oursupercomputers,&quot; he added.   NEC also claims to have the world's fastest supercomputer.In its most powerful configuration, the new NEC mainframe isnearly four times as powerful as the current generation. NECalso claimed to have the world's fastest mainframe when itlast announced a new round of machines in 1985 and 1986.   But NEC's share of the high-end market is still onlyaround 2% of the U.S. market, and 8% of the Japanese market,analysts said. The company said it expects to sell about 200of the ACOS 3800 machines in the next five years, comparedwith about 150 systems of the comparable machines in the pastfive years. Hitachi, in contrast, expects to sell 1,000 ofits machines, according to analysts.</TEXT></DOC>
