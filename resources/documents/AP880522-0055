(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Uniformed police officers will form abackdrop and presidential press secretary James Brady will look onin an elaborate ceremony planned for signing of a bill banning thesale of cheap handguns in Maryland.   Gov. William Donald Schaefer plans to sign the bill Monday atthe Maryland State House, where more than 200 police officers areexpected to take part, said Luther Starnes, Schaefer's assistantpress secretary.   The main speaker will be Sarah Brady, who became active ingun-control efforts nationally after her husband was seriouslywounded in the assassination attempt on President Reagan by JohnHinckley Jr.   Legislative leaders and other officials who helped push the billthrough the General Assembly last month also have been invited.   Schaefer aides say the ceremony is not intended to send amessage to pro-gun groups that are collecting signatures onpetitions to place the bill on the ballot for a public vote inNovember.   State officials characterize the bill as unique in that it setsup a board to determine what handguns can be sold in Marylandbeginning in 1990. It will be legal to possess guns approved by thereview board, but it will be against the law for anyone, includingprivate owners, to sell weapons not on the approved list.   The law is primarily aimed at the cheap handguns, known asSaturday night specials, that are often used in street crimes.   The review board also is directed to omit from the list ofapproved guns any weapons that have the serial number removed oraltered and guns made primarily of plastic that aren't easilydetected by metal detectors.   Weldon Clark, founder of a group called Stop Gun Prohibition,said his group is convinced it can easily collect the 33,044signatures needed to force a referendum on the bill in November.   Ted Lattanzio, the NRA's director of state and local affairs,said the bill was steamrolled through the Legislature in anatmosphere of emotional hysteria.   He said the public was deluded ``into thinking it (the bill)will have an impact on crime, which it won't.''   Vincent Demarco, who resigned as an assistant state attorneygeneral to head Marylanders Against Handgun Abuse, said his groupis concerned about a referendum even though public opinion pollsshow overwhelming support for a ban on the sale of Saturday nightspecials.   ``The NRA has won referendums in other states by spending a lotof money and misrepresenting the situation and telling peoplefalsehoods,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
