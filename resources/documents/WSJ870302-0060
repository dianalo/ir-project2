RobertsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> USWTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><DATELINE> VAIL, Colo.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   With its telephone company units stagnant, U S West Inc. is counting on non-telephone operations to boost its 1987 earnings 4% to 6%. That's below the growth target of as much as 8% that the company set for itself a couple of years ago.    Addressing securities analysts and money managers here, Howard P. Doerr, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said, &quot;We expect to see only modest earnings growth in 1987.&quot; As a group, the regional Bell holding company's non-telephone operations will be profitable this year for the first time since the company launched them after the 1984 Bell system breakup, he said. &quot;That is where we expect the earnings growth to come from,&quot; Mr. Doerr said.    In 1986, U S West, based in Englewood, Colo., had net income of $924.3 million, or $4.86 a share, including a $52 million restructuring charge. Excluding the charge, earnings would have been $976.3 million, or $5.13 a share. Mr. Doerr said the modest increase expected this year would reflect a rise from the $5.13 a share earned before the restructuring charge.    U S West's forecast of smaller profit gains reflects a likely pattern among all seven of the regional Bell concerns, securities analysts note. Also like U S West, the other six generally are increasingly relying on their non-telephone operations for any profit gains. Some analysts say that dependence means greater pressure on the managers of those operations, many of which have been started from scratch or acquired and have posted huge losses. &quot;It is going to be a tough managing process,&quot; Mr. Doerr said of U S West's diversified operations.    To the surprise of many Wall Street analysts, the seven concerns as a group have posted double-digit earnings increases in the years since the breakup of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., primarily because of sharp cost cutting at their local phone company units and rate increases granted by state utility regulators.    Now, however, &quot;you are going to see a slowing of earnings on the telephone company side&quot; of the Bell holding concerns, said Patrick Jurczak, analyst with E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. Joel D. Gross, analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., forecast earnings for the Bell concerns of 5% to 7% for the next two or three years.    In the short term, &quot;I don't see 6% to 8% growth,&quot; the target for earnings growth that U S West had set for itself, said Mr. Doerr, later adding, &quot;the business has changed.&quot;    The industry's downward earnings trend stems in large measure from the regional companies' sparkling earnings performance to date. Consequently, with the exception of St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell Corp., the regional companies generally are earning their allowed rates of return -- the earnings cap imposed by state utility regulators. For that reason, &quot;the regulated side of the Bell companies absolutely has to see a slower rate of growth,&quot; or else they would overearn, said Bruce Hyman, analyst with Fitch Investors Service Inc., a debt rating company.    In addition to reaching the earnings ceiling on intrastate calls, the Bell concerns' rate of return for connecting long-distance carriers to local customers was reduced, effective this year, to 12% from 12.75% by the Federal Communications Commission. For example, that factor alone will reduce U S West's 1987 net income $43 million, Mr. Doerr told analysts.    U S West's earnings this year face another pressure that is more severe than at the other six companies. It stems from a change ordered recently by the FCC in an arcane phone industry concept called &quot;separations.&quot; Separations involve the use of complex factors for deciding how much of plant and equipment -- for example, a pole -- is used for local calling and how much for long-distance calling. The change will reduce the company's net income $70 million this year, said Mr. Doerr. While the change applies to all seven companies, the impact is much more severe on U S West, said Robert Morris III, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. &quot;It is going to haunt U S West until the end of the decade,&quot; he added.    The company's depreciation expenses also are increasing $300 million this year, Mr. Doerr said. On a brighter note, earnings will be boosted about $60 million this year because of lower taxes, he added. The company also will post a pre-tax boost of $86 million stemming from a pension accounting change. </TEXT></DOC>
