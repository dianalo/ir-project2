Axisymmetricelectron beam transport in a homogeneous magnetic field with a sharpboundary is considered. The beam is assumed to be injected from the areawith a zero value of magnetic field strength. It is shown that of creationof the conditions for equilibrium injection and use of an external magneticfield may improve beam quality in high-current electron-optical instruments.</TEXT></DOC>
