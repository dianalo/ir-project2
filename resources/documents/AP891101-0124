Proposition 7 would eliminate the century-old section of theoath to which an officeholder must swear publicly that he or shedidn't bribe anyone to get the job.   If the proposed state constitutional amendment passes,officeholders still would swear to faithfully execute their dutiesand preserve, protect and defend the constitutions and laws of theUnited States and Texas.   And they would be required to sign a written oath denying thatany bribery took place.   But public disavowals of bribery would be out.   Opponents said during the legislative debate that the oath, asit stands, is no problem. They also said such amendments clutterthe ballot and detract from more important issues.   Secretary of State George Bayoud said he didn't find taking theoath undignified.   ``I kind of like it,'' Bayoud said. ``During my swearing in,there were people from around the state here and they said theyliked it.''   The bribery provision was added to the 1876 Texas Constitutionas a reaction to corruption during Reconstruction.   Backers of the change say it is an outdated remnant of anothertime. And it's not as if the constitutional oath were sacrosanct.It has been changed before.   Until approval of a 1938 amendment, officeholders were requiredto swear that they hadn't participated in a duel.</TEXT></DOC>
