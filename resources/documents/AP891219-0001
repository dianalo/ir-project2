Baker IIIexpressed ``regrets'' he may have misled Americans about high-levelU.S. contacts with Beijing.   The White House announced that Bush had approved the export ofthree communications satellites to be launched by China, and hadended a prohibition on the Export-Import Bank providing help tocompanies doing business in China.   The president's actions came as Baker said through a spokeswomanhe regretted that in a recent television interview, he may havemisled the public about the two trips to China by high-level U.S.officials.   Whether the administration was misleading the public promptedclose questioning of White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, whomounted a vigorous defense of President Bush's secret contact withthe Chinese leadership.   The furor erupted after it was learned Monday that nationalsecurity adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of StateLawrence Eagleburger had visited Beijing in secret in July, inaddition to their previously disclosed trip earlier this month.   Bush notified Congress that he was exempting the threecommunications satellites, which are being built or renovated bythe Hughes Aircraft Co., from economic sanctions imposed on Chinaafter last June's crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Hughes is sellingthe satellites to firms in Australia and Hong Kong for launch on aChinese rocket.   ``The sale of these satellites represents approximately $300million worth of business for U.S. firms,'' said a statement byFitzwater.   The statement said the move was ``consistent with thepresident's expressed determination, in imposing sanctions lastJune, to maintain commercial relations with China.''   The July trip came at a time when the administration saidhigh-level visits to Beijing were banned because of the violentsuppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in June.   Baker, appearing on ABC-TV Dec. 10, called the December trip byScowcroft and Eagleburger ``the first time we've had high-levelU.S. officials go to the People's Republic of China.'' Baker notedhe himself had publicly met high Chinese officials in othercountries.   Asked about the apparent discrepancy, spokeswoman Margaret D.Tutwiler said Tuesday that Baker ``felt obligated to protect thesecrecy of a mission that the President wished to have classified.He regrets that me may have misled some.''   She added: ``He felt that by acknowledging his own directinvolvement it was sufficient to make the point that this (Decembertrip) was not the first case of high-level contact.''   Before that statement, she had said Baker did not feel he hadlied.   On the satellites, the White House statement said, ``Approval ofthese licences is in keeping with the president's policy not todisrupt normal commercial relations with China.''   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., called Bush's approval ``a trueoutrage'' and ``another effort to curry favor with the hardlinersin Beijing and an insult to the memory of those who died fordemocracy in Tiananmen Square.''   Gore sponsored the legislation that forbids the launch ofU.S.-manufacturered satellites Chinese rockets unless the presidentdeclares it to be in the U.S. national interest, as Bush has done.   Before the satellite announcement, Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.,said Bush's sending of high-level emissaries to China after theviolent Chinese crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators ``makesthe president look like a wimp in Beijing and a hypocrite inWashington.'' His comments were in a statement issued while he wastraveling in Nepal.   Facing criticism from members of Congress that theadministration has been too friendly with China in the aftermath ofthe June crackdown, the White House issued a separate two-page``justification'' of the satellite action.   ``After launch, they will be controlled for civil use,'' theWhite House statement said. ``It is in the national interest of theUnited States to approve export licernses for the three satellitescurrently being prepared for launch in China.''   Two of the satellites are being built by Hughes Aircraft Co. forAUSSAT, an Australian company. The other one is being refurbishedby Hughes for AsiaSat, based in Hong Kong.   The White House also cited ``national interest'' in waivingrestrictions on the Export-Import bank's financing of U.S. businessactivities within China.   The bank is a government agency which helps provide a range ofassistance to U.S. companies, including low-interest loans, to helpthem set up overseas operations.   The White House said the waiver ``preserves a level playingfield for U.S. business. Additional business activity with Chinawill be considered on a case-by-case basis as part of a continuingreview process.''   Fitzwater, under close questioning by reporters, declared Bushhad not misled Americans, as critics contended.   ``It is not misleading to not tell you about everything he'sdoing,'' Fitzwater said.   At the State Department's daily briefing, Tutwiler was askedwhether she felt the American public had been misled on U.S. policytoward China.   ``I certainly don't think that I've lied,'' she said. ``I knowMarlin doesn't think that he's lied. Secretary (of State James A.)Baker doesn't think he's lied and the president doesn't think he'slied.''   Fitzwater said he could not comment on whether there had beenother trips to China that still remained secret.   But he said, ``There have been trips you don't know about. Therewill be more.''   Fitzwater said Bush dispatched Scowcroft and Eagleburger in Julyto make sure that China's hard-line leaders knew the seriousness ofU.S. anger over the crushing of the pro-democracy demonstrations.   He said it was important to keep the trip secret so the Chineseknew that denunciations of the crackdown were more than publicposturing.   Denying that the administration had violated its own ban onexchanges with China, Fitzwater said there never was any intentionto cut off all high-level contact. He said there was a distinctionbetween high-level ``exchanges'' and high-level ``contacts.''</TEXT></DOC>
