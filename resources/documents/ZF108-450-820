 From now on, you are a systemsengineer.&quot;andP;  Engineer, I thought, what's that?andP;  Then I recalled a saying I hadheard in college: &quot;Yesterday I couldn't spell engineer, and today I are one.&quot;andM;I didn't think that as a systems engineer I did anything diferently than Idid as a systems analyst.andP;  In fact, I was right.andP;  I was a systems analystalthough I followed orders and called myself an engineer.andM;Over the years, I have seen the job titles software engineer and systemsengineer often, and I have accepted the fact that people in informationsystems call themselves engineers.andM;A few years ago I began seeing the term &quot;re-engineering&quot; in the literature.andO;Shortly after that, I saw products that promised to perform re-engineering.andO;A great term, I though, but is re-engineering just a name for some otherfunction?andP;  It didn't take me too long to find out that a re-engineer reallywas someone involved in software maintenance who specialized in structuralchanges.andM;Re-engineering means reworking existing code to improve its effectivenessand/or maintainability.andP;  Vendors often refer to code developed by programmersas spaghetti code and use the term structured code for that spaghetti coderebuilt into a structured format.andM;Technological progress continues.andP;  We now know that systeme engineers designsystems that are coded by programming engineers.andP;  This code then deterioratesand is re-engineered back into structured code.andP;  Actually, the correct titlefor the programmer is &quot;forward engineer&quot; -- someone who moves the programspecs forward into executable code.andM;Technology now has progressed to reverse engineering.andP;  Wow!andP;  A reverseengineer!andP;  That must really be a high-priced job.andP;  I wanted to know what weused to call a reverse engineer.andP;  Guess what?andP;  I couldn't find a previouslabel.andM;Reverse engineering is the opposite of forward engineering.andP;  When a forwardengineer takes program specs an converts it into code, we can give that codeto a reverse engineer who will convert it back to program specs.andP;  In otherwords, a forward engineer moves the developmental process from requirementsto an operational computer system, while a reverse engineer takes anoperational computer system and converts it back to requirements.andM;Why would anyone want to take something that works and move it back to anearlier part of the development process?andP;  That seems like taking a houseapart to get back to the frame.andP;  The answer is that the transverse engineerwants code re-engineered into specifications.andM;Wait a minute.andP;  Our systems engineer designed something, which our forwardengineer turned into code, which our reverse engineer turned back into specs,so it could be given to our transverse engineer.andP;  Are you getting the feelingthat we are on a merry-go-round?andM;However, the transverse engineer is of value to an organization.andM;What the transverse engineer does is take the reverse-engineered design specsand &quot;transverse&quot; those current design specs into something that better meetsthe needs of the end customer.andP;  It is the transverse engineer who modifiesand improves both the system's functionality and its architecture.andM;The systems analyst generally begins with the customer/end user defining theneeds.andP;  The transverse engineer begins with the existing definition of anoperational system.andP;  The systems engineer has to create the initial design;the transverse engineer starts with the workable design.andP;  The systemsengineer generally takes a long time to develop a system; the transverseengineer can make significant changes quickly.andM;Why doesn't the systems engineer begin with the current design specs?andO;Usually the current design specifications don't exist.andP;  In many cases theywere lost years ago.andP;  No one in the end-user area and no one in informationsystems really understands the whole system well enough to document theoperational design specs.andP;  However, those design specs are embedded in theoperational code.andM;Once the design specs are in machine format, the transverse engineer can thenextend and improve on those design specs, often with the help ofcomputer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools.andM;Transverse engineering is a concept for the 1990s.andP;  It is a concept driven byre-engineering and reverse engineering tools.andM;Yes, Virginia, there really are transverse engineers.andP;  And yes, they can makea significant contribution to improving the hundred-plus billion lines ofcode that exist in the United States.andM;William E.
