This Order implements and supplements requirementsfound in 43 CFR Part 3160 relating to the measurement of gas produced underthe terms of Federal and Indian (except Osage) oil and gas leases, as wellas gas produced from State or privately owned when Federal and/or Indianleases receive a share of such production under the terms of an approvedagreement. The Order addresses gas measurement by orifice meter and gasmeasurement by other methods acceptable to the authorized officer of theBureau of Land Management. Gas measurement by electronic flow computers,utilizing an orifice, which calculate volume using the equations specifiedby the American Gas Association (AGA) Committee Report No. 3, may be approvedby the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) State Office having jurisdictionover the producing area. The Bureau of Land Management's existing internalguidelines on the subject of gas measurement were never formalized in aNotice to Lessees and Operators. Thus, this Order has no direct predecessor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>March 27, 1989; this order is applicable March27, 1989 for new facilities, August 23, 1989 for existing facilities measuring200 MCF or more per day of gas, and February 26, 1990 for existing facilitiesproducing less than 200 MCF per day of gas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS:</T2> Suggestions or inquiries may be submitted to: Director(610), Bureau of Land Management, Room 601, Premier Building, 1800 C Street,NW., Washington, DC 20240.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Richard T.

At the request ofseveral respondents, BLM published a <T4> Federal Register</T4> Notice on April 6, 1988 (53 FR 11318), whichextended the comment period through April 19, 1988.During the comment period, written comments were received from 44 sources:32 from business interests related to the oil and gas industry, 6 fromoffices of Federal agencies, 5 from associations, and 1 from a State agency.The time and effort spent in reviewing the proposed rulemaking and thehighly detailed responses offering constructive and skillful suggestionsfor improvement are appreciated. Many of the comments, both technical andeditorial, were adopted and are reflected in the final rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of General Comments  </ITAG>A number of comments supported formalizing measurement requirements andstated that promulgating rules will facilitate a better understanding ofthe requirements. Three comments objected to the entire concept of theproposed rulemaking, arguing that it is unnecessary. One comment statedthat the proposed rulemaking in its present form was not authorized bythe statutes. The necessary authority for the rulemaking exists at 30 U.S.C.1711 and 30 U.S.C. 189. The Order will benefit overall both the oil andgas companies and the various government agencies by providing the minimumstandards critical to accurate measurement and reporting of productionnationwide.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Custody Transfer/Allocation Meters  </ITAG>A number of comments stated that the proposed rule should apply only tocustody transfer measurements and not allocation measurements. They arguedthat the proposed rules are for application to single phase, homogeneousoil, gas, or condensate flows that have been cleaned up and stabilizedfor commercial pipeline transport. The comments also argued that allocationmeters may involve the two-phase flow of vapor and liquids and, therefore,the allocation meter should not be held to the same tolerances as the custodytransfer or sales meter. A custody transfer or sales meter is one fromwhose measurements royalty is determined directly. An allocation meteris a meter whereby production is measured and credited to a lease(s) orwell(s). BLM has the responsibility to designate or accept measurementpoints (meters) from whose measurements royalties will be determined. Allsuch designated measurement points are required to meet the minimum standardsof this Order. The designated or accepted measurement point may be a custodytransfer meter, a sales meter or an allocation meter. In any case, themeters are required to be measuring single phase flow. BLM requires thatall production removed or sold from the lease be placed into marketablecondition using appropriately sized and maintained production equipment,and that the oil, water, and gas be separated prior to measurement or thata variance be approved. To make it clear that the proposed standards applyto allocation as well as sales meters, the phrase ``and allocation'' hasbeen added to paragraph 2 of section III-B.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Responsibility for Proper Measurement  </ITAG>Several comments were received expressing concern that the proposed Orderwould hold the lessee/operator responsible for the handling and propermeasurement of lease production, when in some cases the sales meters areowned and operated by the purchaser/transporter. In such cases, the operatormay not have control over the measurement equipment. Most comments urgedthat the responsibility for proper sales measurement be placed on the ownerof the sales meter and that only the responsibility for allocation measurementshould be placed on the lessee/operator. It is recognized that the purchaseroften owns and maintains the custody transfer/sales meter. However, requirementsfor proper measurement are normally included in the purchase contract.Existing regulations hold the lessee/operator responsible for assuringthat all lease oil and gas production operations, including proper measurement,comply with Department of the Interior regulations, whether conducted bythe lessee or by parties having contractual agreements with the lessee.This Order does not change the responsibility of the lessee. The rationaleis that (1) the standards in this Order are generally AGI standards, (2)normal sales contracts require the purchaser to maintain the sales meterproperly, and (3) historically, holding the lessee/operator responsiblefor proper measurement has not created significant problems for the operatorsor purchasers. It is recognized that the operator is often personally unableto correct violations resulting from meter problems, and this has beentaken into account in setting abatement periods. In addition, 43 CFR 3163.2(f)(1)provides civil penalties up to $25,000 for any person who knowingly orwillfully prepares, maintains or submits false, inaccurate or misleadingreports. This regulation applies to the purchaser as well as the lessee/operator. <ITAG tagnum="84">Electronic Flow Computers  </ITAG>A few comments stated that electronic flow computers were widely used andaccepted by both the purchaser and seller, and recommended that the useof this type of secondary element be authorized without case-by-case approval.It is recognized that electronic flow computers are accurate and when properlyinstalled and used with an orifice will measure gas volumes correctly.However, because this type of secondary element is still not proven overlong periods of time, the capabilities of each instrument type, includingall limitations, will be subject to a review by appropriate BLM personneland approval by the State Director.  <ITAG tagnum="84">AGA Standards  </ITAG>Many comments referred to AGA Committee Report No. 3, most of them callingattention to the desirability of using the American National StandardsInstitute (ANSI) and API designation (ANSI/API 2530) in conjunction withAGA or in place of AGA. One comment suggested that, in order to ensurethat no confusion exists as to the standard to be used, Section III shouldstate the full title as follows: ANSI/API 2530-1985 hereafter referredto as AGA Committee Report No. 3, Second Edition. This comment was adoptedas a useful clarification. Other comments suggested adding several additionalreferences and stated that AGA Report No. 3 was insufficient for gas measurement.It is recognized that AGA Report No. 3 includes the required method forcomputing gas volumes, and that other data required are included in numerousother publications by the Gas Processors Association (GPA). However, itis not appropriate to expand the order to include all of the references. <ITAG tagnum="84">Phase-in Period  </ITAG>Specific comments were requested regarding a phase-in period of time afterwhich this Order will become effective. Seventeen comments were receivedstating that a phase-in period is necessary to avoid shut-in of productionand in some cases premature abandonment of some wells, and to allow timeto train field personnel. The recommended time for the phase-in rangedfrom six months to five years. It is agreed that a phase-in period is appropriatewhere the installation of new equipment or the modification of existingequipment, and the training of field personnel, is required. The phase-inperiod will also allow those companies desiring to obtain justifiable variancesto do so and be in full compliance on the effective date of this Order.Accordingly, all sales and allocation facilities measuring 200 MCF perday or more are required to be in full compliance within six months; andall other sales and allocation metering facilities are required to be incompliance within 12 months or to be in possession of a valid varianceissued by the authorized officer. The phase-in periods will commence onthe date this Order is published as a final rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.  During the phase-in period until the effective date of the Order, BLM willcontinue to inspect and enforce all current measurement standards. Thephase-in period is intended to allow time for the operator to bring alloperations, including all existing equipment, specified procedures, andreporting practices into full compliance, and does not in any way relievethe operator from complying with the orders of the authorized officer,or from being subject to the existing laws, regulations, and practicesunder which BLM has carried out the inspection and enforcement functionsin the past.      <ITAG tagnum="85">Exemptions for Low Volume Production </ITAG>Some wells producing gas may not be able to support compliance with someof the minimum standards for gas measurement. Numerous comments requestedexemptions for wells producing low volumes of gas, fields with decliningproduction and a projected production life of five years or less, and wellsdrilled into and producing from certain shallow producing horizons. Thesuggestions ranged from case-by-case exemptions based on economic hardshipto a broad exemption for all wells or any field sharing a common metermeasuring 1000 MCF per day or less. Some comments suggested that wellsqualifying for exemption should be exempt from the entire Order ratherthan selected standards. Other comments stated that standards B-1, 2, 4,and 7 were the ones most restrictive to low volume production, and withwhich it would be difficult or impossible to comply. It is recognized thatsome wells producing gas may not be able to support compliance with someof the minimum standards. Specific language exempting low volume productionand the standards involved has been added in Part III.C. Low volume wellsrequiring artificial means to draw gas to the surface, and fields witha remaining production life of five years where production rates are declining,may also qualify for a variance from some standards on a case-by-case basis.BLM will, however, be working with lessees/operators to designate consolidatedgas sales and allocation meters which may be required to meet all the standardseven though individual well production may be 100 MCF per day or less.<ITAG tagnum="84">Abatement Periods </ITAG>The proposed rulemaking specifically requested comments as to whether aspecific time period or firm deadline should be added to the abatementperiod ``prior to sales or removal''. One comment recommended that specificdeadlines should not be set. Another comment stated that many of the abatementperiods are entirely too short to provide adequate time to correct violations,and made specific recommendations for several standards recommending increasesof 5 to 30 days for abatement. Specific deadlines were not added wherethe abatement period is ``prior to sales or removal,'' but clarificationof that phrase has been added to Section III.C.3. A number of abatementperiods for specific violations were lengthened as recommended in the comments,where such extensions could be justified. Whenever the abatement periodis prior to sales or removal, the potential for permanent loss of royaltyexists and no oil or gas may pass the measurement point. It is assumedthat any irregularities in calibration of the gas meter will be correctedduring the calibration of the meter as prescribed in the Order. Accordingly,the abatement period in the appropriate section of the Order is statedas prior to completion of the calibration. Irregularities, (improper orinaccurate calibration of the gas meter) discovered after the calibrationwill be treated as a violation. An incidence of noncompliance will be issuedstating the appropriate corrective action required and abatement period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose </ITAG>One comment supported the stated intent to provide regulations pertainingto the rights of the operator to administrative and/or judicial reviewand appeal. The regulations pertaining to the rights to administrativereview and hearing on the record, as well as the right to appeal, are containedin 43 CFR Subpart 3165, and language of assurance from that regulationhas been added to the Order in this section, and a provision allowing extensionsof abatement periods for any violation under certain conditions, as well.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope </ITAG>One comment suggested that the description of the applicable lands subjectto this Order, in addition to all Federal and Indian (except Osage) oiland gas leases, be changed to the wording contained in 43 CFR Subpart 3161.1Jurisdiction. The suggestion was adopted and the wording in Section I-C,Scope, was changed to correspond with Subpart 3161.1. Another comment statedthat the scope is too broad, and that it was arbitrary for the Order tobe applicable to State or privately-owned lands, when Federal and/or Indianleases are entitled to share the revenues, no matter how small, from non-jurisdictionalwells. BLM will maintain the wording in 43 CFR 3161.1 as authorized bythe Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982. <ITAG tagnum="84">Definitions </ITAG>Numerous comments offered specific language for amending the proposed definitionsor suggesting the addition of new ones. The term ``authorized representative'' was removed to clarify the intentand ``authorized officer'' was added as recommended in several comments.A definition for ``business day'' was added and the term ``working day''was changed to ``business day'' throughout the Order. One comment observed that most of the major violations listed will notresult in a substantial adverse impact on royalty income. All of the violationsidentified as ``major'' in the proposed Order were re-examined to determinetheir effect on royalty income, and several were changed to minor violations.Violations designated as major involve improperly designed and/or installedequipment incapable of correct measurement, or other circumstances thatdirectly and adversely affect Federal or Indian royalty calculations.One comment requested clarification of the term ``minor violation'' becauseit could be construed to ripen ultimately into a major violation. ThisOrder uses the definitions of major and minor violations used in the regulations.They are separate offenses with separate penalties. However, a minor violationremaining uncorrected for as little as a few hours could indeed attainthe status of a major violation and the Incident of Noncompliance be reissuedas major. The civil penalties for failure to comply with written ordersto correct major and minor violations are contained in 43 CFR 3163.2(g)(2). One comment suggested the addition of definitions for ``operator'' and``operating rights owner''. These definitions were added in order to explainthe distinction between the terms. One comment suggested that the definitionof ``Production Unit Measure'' be changed from (Mcf) to (Mscf). This suggestionwas not adopted. The definition of standard cubic foot should suffice withthe change of 520anddegrees; , Rankine to 519.67anddegrees; Rankine, made inthe interest of accuracy as recommended in several comments.  Several comments addressed the definition of ``by-pass'', offering varyinglanguage. All references to ``by-pass'' were removed from this Order. Thisterm is adequately covered in Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 3.  One comment observed that the definition of ``Incident of Noncompliance''(INC) was not consistent with Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 4 on Oil Measurementand suggested that it be changed. The definition was rewritten to maintainconsistency between the measurement orders.  Several comments offered various changes to the definition of gas. Thesesuggestions were not adopted, because the definition used is taken directlyfrom the regulations. Several comments submitted additional terms theythought out to be defined, such as ``custody transfer'', ``purchaser/transporter'',``BTU content'', ``point of delivery'', ``allocation measurement'', and``primary and secondary elements''. The suggestions were reviewed and theterms found not sufficiently useful to be defined in this Order.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Requirements  </ITAG>Minimum standard no. 30 on recordkeeping was removed and relocated as anintroductory paragraph III.A. notifying the public of this requirement,because recording and reporting are a procedural requirement of the FederalOil and Gas Royalty Management Act rather than being an enforceable minimumstandard. To accommodate this insertion, section III.A. General was changedto III.B. General. Also, the words ``and allocation'' were inserted inIII.B.2. to clarify the intent of the Order.  Numerous comments asked questions as to the intent of the Order in generalterms and as to how the Government would respond in certain situations,such as whether equipment failure would result in a violation citationfor an operator. In response to such questions, section III.B. of the Orderwas greatly expanded to provide this information.  C. Gas Measurement by Orifice Meter  In response to many comments, the language in section III.C. was changedto exclude the requirement that metering stations in compliance with thisOrder be retrofitted, as a result of revisions to AGA Report No. 3. Theterm ``prior to sales'' was further defined, appropriate language for theexemption of certain low volume production was inserted, and a paragraphnotifying the lessee/operator that the authorized officer may require consolidatedmetering stations was added.  Standards No. C.1 and C.2  Numerous comments addressed the requirements for maintaining beta ratioswithin the AGA prescribed range. Most comments were concerned with exemptionsfor low volume wells. Other comments stated that the standards were toolengthy and needed clarification. Both standards were condensed and amendedto clarify the intent and to be consistent with AGA.  Standard No. C.3  One comment stated that the term ``normal'' when applied to flow conditionswas nebulous and suggested that substituting ``optimum'' would make themeaning clearer. The suggestion was adopted. Several comments were receivedcalling for clarification of the minimum length of pipe preceding and followingan orifice and suggesting the insertion of the word ``straight'' as a betterdescription of the length of (straight) pipe. The suggestion improves themeaning and was adopted. Two comments stated that the phrase ``shut-ingas meter'' in the corrective action was inappropriate and should be removed.The term has been removed from all the standards in this Order. One commentstated that a violation of this standard should not be classed as major.However, there is a potential for reductions in royalties collected thatmay not be recoupable, and the suggestion to change the violation to minorwas not adopted.  Standard No. C.4  Two comments stated that low volume producers (100 to 200 MCF/D) shouldbe exempted from this standard. It is agreed that production of 100 MCF/Dmeasured on a monthly basis should be exempt from this standard as statedin the Order. Several comments argued that maintaining recordings in themiddle one-third of the chart range was too restrictive. Some stated theouter two-thirds of the chart range was more acceptable, while others suggestedthat the middle one-third of the chart range be required where practicalor possible. It is agreed that the middle one-third is too restrictive.In the final Order the range has been expanded to include the outer thirdof the chart range to accommodate improved chart recordings for variousproduction rates.  Standard No. C.5  Numerous comments recommended that the standard be amended to require thestatic element to be sized so that it records in the 50 to 70 percent ofthe chart range. This is agreed to in part for the same reason discussedin the previous paragraph, and the standard is changed to read ``outertwo-thirds of the chart range''.  Standard No. C.6  Several comments recommended the removal of the sentence, ``Sample probesmay be installed upstream of the straightening vanes,'' because it servesno purpose and is confusing. The sentence has been removed.  Standard No. C.7  Numerous comments included recommendations ranging from exemption of wellsproducing 500 MCF/D from the requirement of a continuous temperature recorderto the use of indicating thermometers only, especially where the flowinggas temperatures did not vary more than 5 to 10 anddegrees;F. Following anintensive review, the standard has been removed and a new standard substitutedexempting a broad class of salas and allocation meters measuring 200 MCF/Dor less from the necessity of employing a continuous temperature recorder,and providing for possible issuance of a variance for sales and allocationmeters measuring between 200 and 500 MCF/D. It is not intended to exemptany sales or allocation meters from temperature measurements of the flowingas which are required by AGA for computing volumes. The relaxation of thestandard does allow for the use of indicating thermometers to measure thetemperature within the limitation of the new standard. Even small temperaturechanges will result in significant variations in royalty revenues wherelarge volumes of gas are measured and sold and in these cases strict adherenceto the standard is required.     Standard No. C.8 Several comments were received, one of which offered rewording for andanother suggested removal of the standard, arguing that the standard isrestrictive and not in accordance with AGA Report No. 3. The intent ofthe standard is to require compliance with AGA standards and avoid anyrecess of the orifice plate as measured parallel to the axis of the metertube. If the inside diameter of the meter tube pipe differs from the orificefitting the difference in sizes shall be within AGA specified tolerances.One comment stated that meter tube inspections are time consuming and requireshut-in, and recommended inspections at reasonable intervals not to exceedfour years. It is agreed that the inspection is time consuming and requiresshut-in, and that short intervals between inspections are not appropriate.Predetermined intervals are not intended to be set for meter tube inspections.The normal inspection for other minimum standards may reveal the need forinspection of the meter tube as well. However, the inspections will notbe regularly scheduled. It is recognized that some orifice fittings andpipe connections are of different sizes, but in some cases have been machinedor modified to consistent internal diameters. In these cases, the operatorsshould stamp notice of such modifications on the fitting where appropriate.An inspection may still be conducted to confirm the modification. Standards No. C.9 and C.10 Several comments stated that the standards were more restrictive than theAGA requirements and suggested removal of the phrase ``Shut-in gas meterand''. Recommendations for the abatement period were to change to 60 days.This is agreed to in part and the provision rewritten to combine the 2standards as number 9 and to refer to the recommended AGA requirements.Field experience has shown that shutting in the gas meter is not alwaysnecessary and could result in damage to the resource. The abatement periodrecommendation was not adopted because of a potential for nonrecoupableloss of royalty revenue. Standard No. C.11 Numerous comments suggested different wording and clarification. Afterreview, it was decided to remove the standard from this order, becauseit is adequately covered in Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 3. Standard No. C.12 (now no. 10) All the comments on this standard addressed the frequency of inspectionof the orifice plate. Two comments recommended changing the frequency ofremoval and inspection to every 6 months. This is agreed to in part andthe standard has been changed to read ``at least semiannually''. Standard No. C.13 (now no. 11) Several comments addressed this provision. One recommended changing theabatement period to 24 hours while another recommended 30 days or priorto sales whichever occurs first. Two comments agreed with the requirementand abatement period. Two comments suggested minor changes to the correctiveaction. No changes were made to the standard or abatement period. Minorchanges in wording were made to the corrective action, but did not changethe intent. The violation remains major because of the potential for nonrecoupableloss of royalty revenue. Standard No. C.14 (now no. 12) A few comments addressed the standard, suggesting only minor rewordingof the corrective action to include recording of the ``as found'' and ``asleft'' readings. This recommendation has been adopted. Standard No. C.15 (now no. 13) Several comments were received and some agreed with the standard. One commentsuggested changing the term ``meter pen'' to ``meter differential pen''and one observed that the zero position of the recording devices shouldbe checked every time data is collected from the recording device. Theformer suggestion has been adopted in part, to clarify the term ``meterpen'', and the words ``the static and differential'' inserted. The correctiveaction was also changed to require the recording of the ``as found'' and``as left'' readings as suggested by a comment. Standard No. C.16 (now no. 14) One comment recommended that the corrective action be changed to includethe ``as found'' and ``as left'' readings. This recommendation was adopted.Standard No. C.17 (now no. 15) Several comments were received addressing this standard. One comment recommendedchanges to the corrective action to include the word ``calibration.'' Therecommendation was not adopted. However, the corrective action was rewrittenand clarified. Several comments asked for clarification of the standardregarding the number of points in the chart range where accuracy of thedifferential pen should be tested. One comment observed that the differentialpen should be the most accurate within the recording range. The suggestionwas adopted in part and the standard was rewritten to include tests foraccuracy of the differential and static pens at only 3 points, one of whichmust be within the normal range of the differential recording. Standard No. C.18 (now no. 16) Two comments addressed this standard. One comment suggested that the correctiveaction and abatement period should be altered to include the words ``afterthe as found calibration is performed,'' while the other comment suggestedclarification of the standard. The former suggestion was not adopted, butthe standard was rewritten to clarify the intent and parts of the correctiveaction were merged into the standard. Standard No. C.19 (now no. 17) Numerous comments objected to the requirement that meters be tested monthlyfor the first 3 months following installation and repair. Most commentssuggested that if initial calibration of the meter is found to be adequate,the meter testing frequency should then be semi-annual. This was agreedto in part and the requirement for the monthly tests following installationor repair has been removed. However, the suggestion that meters be calibratedon a semi-annual basis rather than quarterly as prescribed was not adopted.The corrective action was simplified to read ``Test meter for accuracy.''The abatement period of prior to sales was removed and a two-part abatementprovision inserted to cover both abatement following installation and repairsand failure to calibrate the meter quarterly. Standard No. C.20 (now no. 18) Numerous comments objected to the requirement that the authorized officerbe given at least 24 hours notice when meter calibrations are conducted.Several comments urged that the abatement period should be changed to priorto next calibration. The suggestions to remove or change the requirementwere not adopted. The intent of this requirement is to permit the authorizedofficer to schedule visits to witness some of the meter calibrations. Thecalibration schedule may be submitted in advance for the current year ifdesired. It is recognized that schedules determined far in advance maynot be followed exactly. However, a schedule from each operator will permitthe BLM to arrange visits to witness calibrations and work with the operatorregarding later changes to the planned schedule. The abatement period waschanged as recommended. Standard No. C.21 (now no. 19) Several comments suggested that the abatement period should be lengthenedfor the submission of corrected volumes when meter inaccuracies exceed2 percent. Recommendations were to delete the current ``prior to completionof calibration'' and change to a time period ranging from 10 to 120 days.One comment recommended a dual corrective action and abatement period thatwould apply to (a) situations where the meter was being calibrated, and(b) the submission of a corrected volume report. This suggestion was adopted.Also, in response to requests to allow a more reasonable time to submita corrected volume report, the abatement period was changed to 60 daysin the final rulemaking. Standard No. C.22 (now no. 20) Several comments were submitted regarding estimating volumes when measuringequipment is discovered to be out of service. Most of the comments wereconcerned with the abatement period and recommended a longer period rangingfrom 30 to 120 days. A longer abatement period is justified because theviolation is minor and more time may be needed to obtain information fromother parties: The period has been extended to 60 days in the final rulemaking.No changes were made in the standard and the corrective action receivedminor word changes. Standard No. C.23 (now no. 21) Several comments recommended the deletion of the reference to paragraph6.3 of AGA Committee Report No. 3, stating that the reference would betoo restrictive in computing volumes of gas. One comment suggested thatvolumes of gas delivered should be calculated in accordance with the flowequations specified in AGA Committee Report No. 3. This suggestion wasadopted and the reference to paragraph 6.3 was removed. The abatement periodwas changed to 60 days because the violation is minor and 60 days may benecessary to obtain chart recordings from the purchaser and make recalculations.Standard No. C.25 (now no. 23) Several comments addressed the determination of the weighted average BTUcontent. Several stated that the term ``weighted average'' needs clarificationand that BTU content is not appropriate for noncombustible gases. Othercomments recommended the abatement period be changed to 30 days. Afterdue consideration the decision was made to remove the term ``weighted average''and the monthly reporting requirements, because it is more appropriatefor the authorized officer to prescribe or approve the variables used inthe BTU value determination on a case-by-case basis. The abatement periodwas changed to 30 days. Standard No. C.26 After a review of the comments this requirement was removed as unnecessaryand imposing too large a routine paperwork burden. Standard No. C.27 (now no. 24) Several comments objected to filing calibration reports with the authorizedofficer on a routine basis, preferring to file them only upon request.In addition, the abatement period was stated to be too short. The commentwas adopted and the Order includes the requirement to submit the metercalibration reports to the authorized officer ``upon request''. Also, theabatement period was changed to 15 days to allow sufficient time for mailingthe reports, considering that the calibration report may not be availableto the operator as the oil meter proving report is available to the operatorunder Order No. 4. Standard No. C.28 (now no. 25) Several comments addressed the method for determining the atmospheric pressureat the metering station for purposes of measurement and meter calibration.Three comments recommended extending the abatement period to 30 days, andone recommended that the atmospheric pressure be established by actualmeasurement at the elevation of the measurement station. The recommendationshave been adopted in the final rulemaking, because it was not the intentof the proposed Order to restrict the determination of the elevation ofthe measurement station, and because potential losses are recoupable byrecalculation after determination of the elevation. Standard No. C.29 (now no. 26) Several comments suggested that the term ``specific gravity'' should bechanged to ``relative density''. The 2 terms are related. Because of commonusage, ``specific gravity'' can be used synonymously and is a useful term.The abatement period has been changed to 30 days as suggested, becauselaboratory analysis may be necessary to determine specific gravity. Standard No. C.30 This standard was removed and made a notification at the beginning of SectionIII of the Order. D. Gas Measurement by Other Methods or at Other Locations Acceptable tothe Authorized Officer Several comments stated that any method of measurement approved by theAGA should be acceptable to the BLM, and that other methods as listed shouldnot be included without referring to the standards governing their use.43 CFR 3162.7-3 specifically approves gas measurement by orifice meteror other methods that may be acceptable to the authorized officer. Sincethe vast majority of metering stations employ an orifice for measurement,it has been determined that applications for the use of other methods ofmeasurement should be accompanied by the specific standards for the methodproposed on a case-by-case basis rather than make the Order more lengthyand complex. The suggestion to add the words ``participating area'' whereverunits are involved, and the recommendation of one comment to add ``positivedisplacement meter'' to the list of other measurements, were adopted. 1. Measurement on the Lease, Unit, Unit Participating Area, or CommunitizedArea Two comments were submitted. One comment stated that, because both workinginterest gas and royalty gas are involved, the classification of a majorviolation for unapproved alternate gas measurement methods was too severe.This comment was not agreed to because it has been determined that thereis a possible potential for nonrecoupable loss of royalty gas. Anothercomment recommended rewording of the conditions of approval wherein thealternate method could be approved if it did not adversely affect royaltyincome. The recommendation was adopted. 2. Measurement at a Location Off the Lease, Unit, Unit Participating Area,or Communitized Area A number of comments were received on this provision. To clarify the intentof this requirement, the BLM will continue to require prior approval foroff-lease measurement and emphasize that the application is required tobe complete and to justify the need and type of measurement method to beused. The violation is classed as major because there is the potentialfor adverse effects on royalty income. The phase-in time period is sufficientto obtain needed approvals. IV. Variances from Minimum Standards Two comments recommended that both oral requests and approvals be allowedso long as the oral request is followed by a written request not laterthan the fifth business day following oral approval. This recommendationis reasonable and has been adopted. In addition, the standard was expandedto include language allowing the authorized officer to issue a Notice toLessees (NTL) and establish modified standards or variances for specificgeographic areas of operation. A provision for the authorized officer toprotect royalty income and provide for proper product verification by requiringadditional standards was also included. While situations requiring additionalstandards should be infrequent, it should be remembered that the Orderconsists of minimum standards rather than optimum standards applicableto every situation on a nationwide basis. When additional standards arerequired, the operator/lessee will be notified in writing. All additionalrequirements will be reasonable and the rationale for imposing the standardswill be fully explained. The principal authors of this final rulemaking are Richard T. Hunter, Lakewood,Colorado; Terry Messerli, Billings, Montana; and Upendra Parikh, Jackson,Mississippi, of the Bureau of Land Management Orders Committee responsiblefor the development and issuance of this Order, assisted by the OrdersTask Group, the staff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management,Bureau of Land Management, the Office of the Solicitor, Department of theInterior, and Jim Fisher, retired from the Bureau of Land Management. ScottEllis, Minerals Management Service, was also a part of the Orders Committeeand assisted on royalty accounting issues. It is hereby determined that this final rulemaking does not constitutea major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C)of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C))is required.The final Order will have minimal adverse economic effects, because itsrequirements reflect the operating practices currently followed by prudentoperators when gas production is measured in accordance with the standardsand specifications published by the American Gas Association (AGA), officiallydesignated as American National Standard ANSI/API 2530, 1985, and AGA CommitteeReport No. 3, second edition. The final Order may provide a beneficialeconomic effect. Industry is less likely to be subjected to assessmentsor penalties resulting from violations and/or the requirement to undertakecostly remedial actions, if it has a better understanding of the requirementsof the Bureau of Land Management that relate to the measurement of gasproduction. The State Governments that share in the royalties collectedand Indian mineral owners will also benefit from assurance of more accurategas measurement. The minimum standards established by this Order essentiallyare those that have been required but not officially promulgated by thisDepartment and impose the same burden on all lessees and operators, regardlessof the size of the entity, on lands where the measurement of gas productionis under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management. Therefore,the Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 and will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>.).The information collection requirements contained in the Order have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et seq</T3>., and assigned clearance numbers 1004-0134, 1004-0135,and 1004-0136.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 43 CFR Part 3160</ITAG>Government contracts, Indian lands_mineral resources, Mineral royalties,Oil and gas exploration, Oil and gas production, Public lands_mineral resources,Reporting requirements.Under the authorities cited below, Part 3160, Group 3100, Subchapter C,Chapter II of Title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended asset forth below:<ITAG tagnum="6">James E.

Introduction</ITAG><T3>A. Authority</T3>This Order is established pursuant to the authority granted to the Secretaryof the Interior pursuant to various Federal and Indian mineral leasingstatutes and the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982. Thisauthority has been delegated to the Bureau of Land Management and is implementedby the onshore oil and gas operating regulations contained in 43 CFR Part3160. Section 3164.1 thereof specifically authorizes the director to issueOnshore Oil and Gas Orders when necessary to implement or supplement theoperating regulations and provides that all such Orders shall be bindingon the lessees and operators of Federal and restricted Indian oil and gasleases which have been, or may hereafter, be issued.Specific authority for the provisions contained in this Order is foundat: andSection;3162.7-1, <T3>Disposition of production</T3>; section 3162.7-3, <T3>Measurement of gas</T3>; and subpart 3163, Noncompliance and assessments.B. PurposeOne purpose of this Order is to establish requirements and minimum standardsfor the measurement of gas by the methods authorized in 43 CFR 3162.7-3,i.e., measurement by orifice meter or other methods acceptable to the authorizedofficer, Proper gas measurement ensures that the Federal Government, thegeneral public, State Governments which share in the proceeds, and Indianmineral owners receive the royalties due, as specified in the governingoil and gas leases.Another purpose of this Order is to establish abatement periods for correctiveaction when noncompliance with the minimum standards is detected. The assessmentsand penalties that will be imposed as a result of noncompliance and/ora failure to correct the noncompliance within the specified abatement period.This Order also serves as notice to any party cited for noncompliance thatit may request from the authorized officer an extension of the abatementperiod for any violation, provided that the request for extension is appliedfor and granted prior to the expiration of the abatement period previouslyallowed.C. ScopeThis Order is applicable to all Federal and Indian (except Osage) oil andgas leases. In addition, this Order is also applicable to all wells andfacilities on State or privately owned mineral lands committed to a unitor communitization agreement that affects Federal or Indian interests,notwithstanding any provision of a unit or communitization agreement tothe contrary.<ITAG tagnum="84">II.

Requirements</ITAG>A. Required RecordkeepingThe operator shall keep all test data, meter reports, charts/recordings,or other similar records for 6 years from the date they were generated,or if involved in an audit or investigation, the records shall be maintaineduntil the record holder is released by the Secretary from the obligationto maintain them. The authorized officer may request these records anytime within this period. Records submitted shall include all additionalinformation used to compute volumes so that computations may be verified.B. GeneralAll gas production shall be measured in accordance with an authorized methodof measurement. As set out in 43 CFR 3162.7-3, gas measurement authorizedfor gas produced from leases, units, and communitization agreements subjectto the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, as such jurisdictionis defined in 43 CFR 3161.1, may be by orifice meter or other methods acceptableto the authorized officer. The requirements and minimum standards for gasmeasurement are set out below.The requirements of this Order are based on the standards and specificationspublished by the American Gas Association (AGA) and officially designatedas ANSI/API 2530 and AGA Committee Report No. 3, second edition, 1985,hereafter referred to AGA Committee Report No. 3. The AGA published standardsand specifications are considered to be appropriate for proper gas measurementby both the Department of the Interior and the Oil and Gas Industry. Therequirements set minimum standards necessary to promote conservation ofnatural resources and to ensure proper measurement of gas production forsales and allocation purposes, so that the Federal Government and Indianmineral owners will receive the royalties due under governing oil and gasleases.All future sales and allocation facilities and sales or allocation facilitiesin existence on the effective date of this Order, unless covered by a validvariance, shall meet the minimum standards prescribed in this Order, provided,however, that all gas produced from or allocated to Federal and Indian(except Osage) oil and gas leases wherein the gas is measured through salesor allocation meters handling 100 MCF per day or less on a monthly basisare exempt from the standards in Section III.C.1, C.2, and C.4 of thisOrder. The authorized officer may, where apropriate and necessary for propermeasurement, work with the operators in designating consolidated gas salesand/or allocation meter stations.Meter installations constructed n accordance with the AGA Committee ReportNo. 3 standards in effect at that time shall not automatically be requiredto retrofit if the standards are revised. The Bureau will review any revisedstandards, and when it is deemed necessary will amend the Order accordinglythrough the rulemaking process.The intent of these minimum standards is to ensure that when equipmentmalfunctions that could result in inaccurate measurement occur, propercorrective actions are taken, the authorized officer is notified, and anamended production report is submitted.Failure to comply with these minimum standards will be considered as noncomplianceand an incident of noncompliance (INC) will be issued. Operators who discovernoncompliance with these minimum standards and take immediate correctiveaction will not be issued an INC. If the authorized officer or his representativeis present when an operator discovers a malfunction or uses incorrect proceduresas specified in this Order, an INC will be issued unless immediate correctiveaction is taken. Failure of equipment will not be considered a violation.However, the incidents of noncompliance which may result from equipmentfailure are considered violations and a partial list is as follows:Failure to install equipment properly.Failure to repair or correct equipment malfunction properly or in a timelymanner.Failure to submit report of alternate method of sales. Failure to submit amended production reports in a timely manner.Fail to adhere to the minimum standard procedures specified in this Order.The use of improper equipment, when discovered, will be considered as aviolation and a formal INC will be issued. The use of improper procedures will be considered as a violation and whenwitnessed by the authorized officer or his representative, immediate correctiveaction will be required. In the event that proper procedures are then usedas required by this Order, and prior to completing the operation, calibration,or proving, the violation will be considered as properly corrected. Inthis case, although the violation will be documented in the agency files,no INC will be issued.A major violation as defined in this Order will generally require an immediateshut-in of the metering device. However, where the non-recoupable lossis not significant or where damage to the resource is likely to occur ifa shut-in is required, an abatement period of 24 hours may be given.Where abatement is required ``prior to sales or removal'', this means thatnecessary action is required to be taken so that no gas may be removedbeyond the measurement point until properly measured.C. Gas Measurement by Orifice Meter The following are minimum standards for the measurement of natural gasusing orifice meters. 1. The orifice to pipe diameter ratio (d/D), or the beta ratio, with metersusing ``flange taps,'' shall be between 0.15 and 0.70. <T3>Violation: </T3>Major. <T3>Correction Action: </T3>Install an orifice of such size that subsequentmeasurements will be within the appropriate beta ratio range. If changingthe orifice causes the differential pressure to be recorded in the lowerone-third of the chart, then either the meter tube or the differentialelement shall be changed, sizing the straight pipe sections in a mannerthat will provide subsequent measurement within the appropriate beta ratiorange. <T3>Abatement Period: </T3>Prior to sales. 2. The orifice to pipe diameter ratio (d/D), or the beta ratio, with metersusing ``pipe taps,'' shall be between 0.20 and 0.67. <T3>Violation:</T3> Major. <T3>Correction Action:</T3> Same as A.1. above. <T3>Abatement Period</T3>: Prior to sales. 3.
