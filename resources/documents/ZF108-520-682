 The company saw pre-tax profit grow by 34% to #8m on turnover up33% to #141m.andP;  The hardware division was sold to Mitsubishi Electric Corplast month (CI No 1,405) for #39m in cash leaving ACT with a pre-tax profitof #17m on that sale.andP;  The hardware division, however, had continued toperform on extremely tight profit margins, only managing to make a #200,000profit over the year.andP;  The part of the company that ACT is retaining issoftware and services, which reported profit up 85% to #8.9m on sales up 69%to #59.3m.andP;  The sale of the hardware division has left ACT with assets of#25m with which Foster said the company would proceed cautiously.andP;  If a juicyacquisition came up it would be in a position to pounce, but it intendsorganic growth over the next year.andP;  ACT plans to be a #100m turnover companyby the end of the next financial year.andP;  It has five divisions: the mostestablished  of these is ACT Financial Systems with revenues up 14% to around#16m.andP;  This company has been around for seven years, but it is only since theappointment of Mike Hart as joint managing director last year that it hasdiversified from its core activity in the UK investment management market.andO;It now has distributors in Australia, Switzerland, Holland and Belgium, butis not in a position to set up an international organisation at this stage.andO;It has taken its Quasar product into the insurance market and has arelationship with the Swiss software company Fides (owned by Credit Suisse)to bring its dealing room system into the wider European market.andP;  Foster saysthat ACT has not seen a slow-down in the financial sector, but added that,unlike Logica, it was not in the bespoke software business and wouldn't touchit with a barge pole.andP;  ACT Medisys was an independent company that wasacquired with ITL.andP;  It used to trade under the name Silicon Lab and is amarket leader in pathology systems.andP;  Although small, it is the fastestgrowing company within the group, especially as it has now moved into theresources management area.andP;  ACT Logsys is about the same size as FinancialSystems and was formed in October to bring ITL and Apricot's Sigmexsubsidiary together to sell into the government area with Open Systems-basedproducts.andP;  ACT Cablestream is one of the group's smaller companies but itsimportance for ACT is that it has the best blue chip customer base of anydivision within the group, including Ford Europe, British Petroleum, andShell among its clients.andP;  It installs large data networks and works alongsidethe other divisions in the group.andP;  Finally, ACT's largest business, with aturnover of #22m, is ACT Computer Support which, supports both Apricot andACT systems, but following the acquisition of DDT last year is now movingaggressively into third party maintenance.andP;  Singer andamp; Friedlander now holdsjust over 20% of ACT's equity, which is the size of stake it always said itwanted.andP;  Foster said there was an ongoing dialogue between the two companiesand would not be drawn as to whether Singer andamp; Friedlander wantedrepresentation on ACT's board.andP;  As for ACT's trading agreement withMitsubishi, Foster said it would be impossible to put a value on it, but thatthe warranty work and maintenance for Apricot hardware that the two companieshad agreed was crucial to the survival of ACT's maintenance business.andM;Infamous &quot;Troubleshooter&quot;andM;ACT is also in a position to buy Apricot and Mitsubishi hardware atfavourable prices.andP;  In fact, however, Hart reckons that a mere 20% of systemintegration sales currently include Apricot hardware.andP;  This is a legacy ofthe autonomy of the Financial Systems division which had a reputation forselling 99% of its software on non-Apricot hardware (CI No 1,254).andP;  Asituation which, ironically, Hart was brought in to rectify.andP;  Furthermore,Mitsubishi and ACT have issued a statement of direction saying that they willwork together as a marketing team in Europe.andP;  As for that infamous TVprogramme &quot;Troubeshooter&quot; where Sir Harvey-Jones suggested that Foster sellApricot's hardware division and get rid of one of his joint managingdirectors (joint managing director Simon Hunt departed yesterday leaving MikeHart as group managing director), Foster said he wouldn't take part in such aproject again, claiming he had decided on Apricot's fate prior toHarvey-Jones arrival.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
