There's &quot;fear that if you make a move, it's going to be a wrong move,&quot; said Suresh Bhirud, a portfolio strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co. &quot;You're much better sitting where you are. It's a state where people aren't compelled to do much of anything.&quot;    The low daily trading volumes in recent months are a growing problem for securities firms, whose profits depend on revenue from securities trading. Many of them still are reluctant to bet on the direction of interest rates after the trauma of last October's stock market crash.    Federal Reserve Bank of New York data on primary dealer transactions in U.S. government and agency securities show trading slipped to a daily average of $92.6 billion in April from about $100.3 billion a day in the first 12 weeks of the year. Primary dealer transactions averaged $113 billion a day in the first quarter of 1987, when there were fewer primary dealers than currently, and $98 billion a day in the first quarter of 1986.    The Securities Industry Association's &quot;Investor Activity Report&quot; shows the average daily value of corporate bonds traded by institutions in the first quarter at $15.2 billion, down from $17.4 billion in the first quarter of 1987.    Carolyn Hildebrandt, SIA's director of macroeconomic studies, said last year's first quarter was marked by rallies in both bonds and stocks. But the first quarter this year was one of rising interest rates and reports of institutional preference for cash-equivalent securities.    The preference for cash among bond investors could continue in the months ahead amid growing speculation that the Federal Reserve may tighten credit further to restrain inflation. Since early February, the rate on Federal funds, or reserves banks lend each other overnight, has climbed about half a percentage point to more than 7%. Some traders expect the rate to average 7 1/4% in coming weeks.    Other money market yields, such as Treasury bills, are hovering at their highest levels since the stock market crash last Oct. 19. In the bond market, 30-year Treasury yields could break above 10% in the weeks ahead from about 9.33%, said Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. But within the next 12 months, the yield on the long-term issue likely will fluctuate between 7% and 8%, he said.    The prediction may be little comfort for readers of Merrill's weekly investment bulletins, which generally have been bullish on the bond market this year. Since the end of January, yields on long-term bonds have climbed about a percentage point.    Merrill Lynch's model portfolio for asset allocation, which was adjusted in April, currently stands at 40% in stocks, 45% in bonds and 15% in cash. In March, that portfolio was 45% stocks, 40% bonds and 15% cash.    Soviet Bond Offering   The Soviet Union plans to sell a 500 million mark ($294 million) Eurobond in West Germany soon, further increasing its debt to the West, banking sources said.    The offering will be the nation's second public borrowing in the European capital market, following a 100 million Swiss franc bond issue last January. The new issue follows a 3.5 billion mark credit agreement signed this month between Bonn and Soviet bankers.    Soviet net foreign debt is estimated at $24 billion. Since it amounts to 57% of the country's 1987 export revenues, it is the second lowest debt among East Bloc countries after Czechoslovakia.    The new Soviet borrowing could be completed within two weeks through the state-owned Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs (Vneshekonobank). The offering will be managed by an underwriting syndicate led by Dresdner Bank AG. A Dresdner Bank spokesman, confirming plans for the offering, said its chairman, Wolfgang Roeller, and the president of Vneshekonobank, Yuri Moskowsky, recently held talks in Moscow.    &quot;We expect (the rate on the new issue) to be close to the yield on the new West German government bond issue for sale next week,&quot; said an executive at the bank involved in the placement of the new Soviet issue. The German government bond is expected to pay between 6 1/2% to 6 5/8% and have a maturity of as much as 10 years.    Another German banker familiar with the deal said the bond placement has to overcome a legal hurdle first. German bourse regulations require that a bond prospectus disclose the issuer's debt and foreign exchange reserves. Such information, however, is highly classified under Soviet law.    But Soviet bankers, reached in Moscow, said the requirement isn't an obstacle. &quot;We were told that the prospectus we had for the Swiss bond (issue) will be good enough for the German one,&quot; said a Vneshekonobank official, who declined to be named.    The prospectus issued by Vneshekonobank for its Swiss-franc bond omitted a disclosure of Soviet foreign exchange reserves and debt. The sources familiar with the German bourse regulations said an escape clause lets the borrower on German capital markets withhold such data if the disclosure might harm it.    Foreign Bonds   Prices of Japanese government bonds rallied in heavy trading. For the first time in several months, over-the-counter volume in the bellwether issue soared to 2.6 trillion yen, or about $21 billion, traders said.    The combination yesterday of two parts of the benchmark 5% No. 105 bonds due 1997 into a single issue helped trigger a burst of activity among securities firms. The price of the bonds for June 20 settlement rose to 102.038 from 101.837 Monday as the so-called simple yield fell to 4.69% from 4.72% semiannually, according to Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    Traders said there still are jitters about the prospects for a new 10-year issue in June, terms of which would usually be set this week. Many traders say the market remains too weak for the Ministry of Finance and the official bond underwriting syndicate to reach agreement on a coupon. The government may take advantage of its favorable cash position and skip the issue altogether, traders said.    West German government bond prices fell as much as 1/4 point, though many issues were unchanged. The government's 6 1/4% issue due 1998 closed the day unchanged at 97.40 bid.    The dreary trading could affect many new offerings next week, traders said, including the latest public bond issue for the West German government via the Federal Underwriting Consortium. Traders expect Bonn to tap the market with a 10-year, 4 billion mark ($2.35 billion) issue with at least a 6 1/2% coupon.    British government bonds edged higher in quiet trading, as yields fell to levels almost identical with long-term U.S. Treasury issues. The yield of the benchmark 11 3/4% 2003/2007 stood at about 9.38%, just above the 9.33% yield on the Treasury's 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 in London trading. The price of the U.K. issue rose 6/32 to 118 5/8.    Corporate Issues   Prices of corporate bonds rose as much as 1/4 point, though many issues were unchanged. Underwriters bought $375 million of new offerings.    The new issues included Ohio Power Co.'s $100 million of 10-year first mortgage bonds, Keycorp's $75 million of five-year senior notes and Union Pacific Corp.'s $200 million of five-year notes.    Meanwhile, a $500 million scheduled debt offering by United Air Lines has been amended to include a so-called poison put feature. According to officials at lead underwriter First Boston Corp., if control of the company changes hands and the ratings on this issue are dropped to single-B-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. or single-B-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., investors have the option to sell the securities back to the company at a price of 101.    The preliminary ratings for the issue are single-B-1 by Moody's and single-B-plus by Sandamp;P.    Poison puts were incorporated in a number of industrial companies' bond issues a couple of years ago to allay investors' fears about the impact of leveraged buy-outs and mergers on their securities holdings.    Some investors who owned debt securities of companies that were taken over saw their holdings sink in value as the resulting companies were usually heavily leveraged, leading rating firms to downgrade the issues.    Treasury Securities   Prices of U.S. Treasury bonds and notes rose little more than 1/8 point. &quot;The market is definitely still bearish,&quot; said Bruce R. Lakefield, executive vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.    The new bellwether 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 rose to 97 28/32 from 97 22/32 as the yield fell to 9.34% from 9.36% Monday. The government's 10-year notes rose to 98 19/32 from 98 15/32 as the yield declined to 9.21% from 9.23%. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 3.12 points to 1206.42. The index ranged between 1200.94 and 1208.75.    In the money market, rates on the Treasury's latest three-month and six-month bills declined slightly. The rate on the new three-month bill eased to 6.30% bid from an average rate of 6.34% at Monday's auction. The rate on the new six-month bill declined to 6.70% bid from an average rate of 6.71% at the auction.    Federal funds traded at an average of 7.08%, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.). Monday's average was 7.21%, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said.    Traders said the Treasury's sale today and tomorrow of $15.75 billion of notes should go smoothly. In so-called when-issued activity, the $8.75 billion of new twoyear notes to be auctioned this afternoon were bid at 8.14%, unchanged from late trading Monday. The $7 billion of five-year, two-month notes to be sold tomorrow were bid at 8.71%, down one basis point.    Municipal Issues   Municipal bonds rose as much as 3/8 point, though many issues were unchanged in quiet trading. More than $485 million of new offerings were priced.    A Citicorp Investment Bank group had the winning bid for about $50.5 million of Florida general obligation pollution control refunding bonds. According to one official with the lead manager, only $10 million remained unsold late yesterday.    Initial orders for the $70 million of Gwinnett County School District, Ga., general obligation school bonds were strong, according to underwriters led by Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.    Underwriters led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. set the final pricing for $79 million of Michigan State Building Authority revenue bonds. The offering consists of serial bonds due 1989-1998, zero-coupon capital appreciation bonds due 1999-2002 and super-sinker term bonds due 2003 and 2004. Serial bonds due 1997 and 1998 were not formally re-offered.    Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities rose about 1/8 point.    Benchmark June Ginnie Mae 9% bonds were quoted at 92 17/32-21/32, up 5/32. The 9% securities yield about 10.26% to a 12-year average life assumption, or about 1.06 percentage points more than the 10year Treasury note.    In the new issue market, underwriters led by Alex. Brown andamp; Sons priced a $101.2 million issue from Holco Mortgage Acceptance Corp. The offering is backed by Ginnie Mae multiple-family mortgage securities. </TEXT></DOC>
