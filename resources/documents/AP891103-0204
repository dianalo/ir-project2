State money to the United Peasants Party and the DemocraticParty and to other social organizations also will end Jan. 1, butthe government said it will not try to recover past payouts.   The Peasant and Democratic parties this year ended a long anddocile alliance with the communists to form a majority coalitionwith Solidarity.   Officials told a news conference the cutoffs underlinegovernment determination to stop granting advantages to certainpolitical parties and start treating each equally.   Communist party spokesman Janusz Bisztyga was not available tocomment on the decision, his office said.   ``The strength of political parties and social and politicalorganizations should grow out of social support and dues, and notfrom any system of privileges,'' said Aleksander Hall, the ministerin charge of relations with political parties.   He said the Solidarity-led government of Prime Minister TadeuszMazowiecki recognizes as ``obvious'' the right to form newpolitical parties and will support constitutional changes to makethat right explicit in the constitution.   The position marked a sharp departure from the attitude of pastcommunist governments, which held that all parties were illegalexcept for the three mentioned in the constitution: the Communists,the Peasants and the Democrats.   Hall said his office plans to call a meeting of the establishedparties and the scores of new ones that sprang up this year duringPoland's sharp turn toward democracy to work out remaining problems.   Controversial points include whether a law should be passed toregulate the activities of political parties, as favored bycommunist legislators, and whether political parties should beallowed to be active at factories and other workplaces, and in thearmy, police, government offices and courts, Hall said.   The communist party now has offices at most state enterprises,functioning in many cases as a shadow management, and in recentmonths several instances have arisen in which workers demandedeviction of party officials.   Direct government subsidies to political parties have beenblocked for the rest of 1989 and no more subsidies will be granted,Marian Dabrowski, a deputy finance minister, told reporters.   He said tax exemptions to the communist party-owned publishingand news kiosk cooperative RSW Prasa, which has a virtual monopolyon newspaper and magazine publishing and sales, also will end Jan.1.   Subsidies to the communist party in 1989 totaled $5.4 millionand tax exemptions given RSW Prasa equaled $21.7 million, saidgovernment spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska.</TEXT></DOC>
