The InternalRevenue Service published proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulationsrelating to the disclosure of returns and return information on January3, 1989 (54 FR 39). The Internal Revenue Service received one written commentand two telephone inquiries pertaining to the proposed amendments. Allthree commentators inquired into the type of litigation support that theTax Division would utilize and about the safeguards to protect againstredisclosure of the returns and return information. The Service explainedthat the Tax Division contemplated the use of outside contractors to processpleadings, correspondence, and the voluminous amounts of documentary evidenceinvolved in large tax cases. These documents would be input into computersand would become part of a data base of case-related documents. This supportwould enhance the retrievability of the documents for use in the preparationand actual trial of these large tax cases. The Service acknowledged thatthe proposed amendments were drafted in a way that would allow the TaxDivision to utilize outside contractors for other tax administration purposesauthorized by 26 U.S.C. 6103(n), although no such other uses are currentlycontemplated. It was also explained that the proposed amendments includeda conforming amendment to andSection; 301.6103(n)-1(d) which already providedfor the safeguarding of returns and return information disclosed undersection 6103(n). Because no request for a public hearing was received,no hearing was scheduled.<ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions</ITAG>Section 6103(n) of the Code authorizes the disclosure, pursuant to Treasuryregulations, of returns and return information to the extent necessaryand in connection with the processing, storage, transmission, and reproductionof returns and return information, and the programming, maintenance, repair,testing, and procurement of equipment, for purposes of tax administration.Section 6103(b)(4) of the Code defines ``tax administration'' to includelitigation arising under the internal revenue laws.Existing andSection; 301.6103(n)-1 of the regulations authorizes disclosuresto third parties under section 6103(n) only by officers or employees ofthe Treasury Department, a State tax agency, or the Social Security Administration,for tax administration purposes. Under the current regulations, the TaxDivision, Department of Justice, cannot make disclosures to third parties.These amendments give disclosure authority to the Tax Division, Departmentof Justice, in order to allow the Tax Division to disclose tax returnsand return information for purposes of obtaining litigation support servicesduring the course of litigation arising under the Code. This authorityis necessary to enable the Tax Division to procure services from outsidecontractors in connection with the Tax Division's tax litigation responsibilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses</ITAG>These rules are not major rules as defined in Executive Order 12291. Therefore,a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. Although this Treasury decisionwas preceded by a notice of proposed rulemaking that solicited public comments,the notice was not required by 5 U.S.C. 553 since the regulations proposedin that notice and adopted by this Treasury decision are interpretative.Therefore, a final Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis is not requiredby the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) and the delayedeffective date requirement of 5 U.S.C. 553(d) does not apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of these amendments to the regulations is James N.Beyer of the Disclosure Litigation Division of the Office of Chief Counsel,Internal Revenue Service. However, personnel from other offices of theInternal Revenue Service, the Office of Chief Counsel, and the TreasuryDepartment participated in developing these amendments to the regulations,both on matters of substance and style.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 301</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Bankruptcy, Courts, Crime, Disclosureof information, Employment taxes, Estate tax, Excise taxes, Filing requirements,Gift tax, Income taxes, Investigations, Law enforcement, penalties, Pensions,Statistics, Taxes.Accordingly, title 26, part 301 of the Code of Federal Regulations, isamended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 301, PROCEDURE AND ADMINISTRATION</ITAG><T4>Paragraph 1.</T4> The authority for part 301 is amended by adding thefollowing citation:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 26 U.S.C. 7805; * * * section 301.6103(n)-1 also issuedunder 26 U.S.C. 6103(n).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 301.6103 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Amended]</ITAG><T4>Par. 2.</T4> Section 301.6103(n)-1 is amended as follows:1.
