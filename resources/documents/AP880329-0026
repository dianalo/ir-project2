(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 700 members of the Army's 82ndAirborne Division parachuted into their home base Monday in aflamboyant end to 12 days of exercises in Honduras, where they weresent in a show of U.S. might.   As family members, commanders and a military band waited, sevenhuge C-141 planes flew over at 5 p.m. Moments later, the first ofthe paratroopers began their descent to the base's Sicily DropZone, evoking a loud cheer.   ``I am glad you are home, Baby,'' Delores Piper told herhusband, Staff Sgt. Charles Piper, as their two young daughtersclung to their father's legs.   Later Monday night, about 100 soldiers from the 7th InfantryDivision Light returned to California, landing at Travis Air ForceBase to greetings from an Army honor guard and a band playing``Stars And Stripes Forever.''   Lt. Gen. John Foss, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps at FortBragg, welcomed the troops, who were dispatched to Honduras onMarch 17 to counter a reported incursion of Nicaraguan forces intothat country. The 82nd is a division of the 18th Airborne Corps.   ``Now, 12 days later, there are no Nicaraguan forces in thatcountry and a cease-fire exists,'' Foss said. ``We were watched byeveryone in the world, and everyone was impressed. I want you toknow I'm very proud of you.''   Some 2,000 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne were deployed toHonduras on March 17. There were part of a 3,200-troop force sentby President Reagan. The rest of the American troops are expectedto return by Wednesday.   ``The Nicaraguans ran back across the border as soon as wecame,'' Piper said. ``We did what we had to do.'' But he added itwas good to be home. ``Honduran ground is too hard to sleep on,''he said.   The mission ended just in time for 1st Lt. Steve Swimley, whosaid he was becoming bored.   ``We were doing the same stuff over and over,'' he said as hehugged his wife, Mary. ``It was clear to me we'd be coming homesoon because we had accomplished our objective.''   His buddy, 1st Lt. Jim Cooper, said he was looking forward ``totaking a shower and drinking a few beers.''   Earlier in the day, about 200 Hondurans demonstrated theirsupport for the Americans outside the Palmerola Air Base inHonduras.   They carried signs saying, ``Thanks for having helped usmaintain our liberty'' and ``Unity makes for democracy, thanks forbeing here.''   Nicaragua denied the reported incursion and claimed the UnitedStates was preparing to invade or was using the deployment as acover for providing equipment to the Contras. U.S. officials havesaid the troops are taking back all the equipment they brought withthem, including tanks and aircraft.   In addition to the 82nd Airborne, the reinforcements includesoldiers from the 7th Light Infantry in Fort Ord, Calif.   The U.S. troops never saw action, but Honduran President JoseAzcona Hoyo said all along he expected them to back him up if theSandinistas didn't withdraw.   By late last week, Honduran officials said the Nicaraguan troopswere back on their own side of the border.</TEXT></DOC>
