The Saudis have told U.S. officials that the threats to theirsecurity come mostly from the country's neighbors to the northeast_ Iran and Iraq _ and from South Yemen, along Saudi Arabia'ssouthern border.   The main items are 315 modern tanks, but two-thirds of the pricetag reflects the cost of equipment and ammunition, including hugetrucks to transport any tanks that break down. The deal is roughlyequivalent to one year's U.S. assistance to Israel.   The Bush administration on Wednesday informally notifiedCongress of the intended sale, setting in motion a 50-day period inwhich Congress either kills the deal by majority votes in theSenate and House or lets it go through. Deliveries will begin inabout 1993.   Israel has registered disapproval of the proposed sale of theM1A2 tank as a matter of principal but thus far has not raisedserious objections, the official said. The sale also faces littleapparent opposition from Israel's supporters on Capitol Hill.   The official, briefing reporters on the condition he not beidentified by name, said he expects some of the tanks will likelybe deployed at a military training school in northwest Saudi Arabianot far from the Israeli border.   This should not be a concern to Israel because ``you need onlyto look at a topographical map of Saudi Arabia to realize thattanks have a very difficult time indeed getting from Saudi Arabiato Israel in combat situations,'' the official said.   A pamphlet on the tank sale, published by the State and DefenseDepartments, said the M1A2 will give the Saudis improved mobilityover severe terrain. The M1A2 would replace French-built tanksdesigned 30 years ago.   The U.S. will benefit from the sale because the M1A2 willenhance the deterrent value of Saudi forces that guard naturalresources of ``critical strategic importance'' to the United Statesand the West, the pamphlet said.   It added that the tank will provide a $3 billion boost to U.S.exports, tens of thousands of man-years of employment for Americanworkers and over $680 million in savings and revenues to the U.S.Treasury.</TEXT></DOC>
