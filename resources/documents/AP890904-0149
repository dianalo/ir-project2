Their findings already are being challenged.   Advocates of more federal spending on homelessness contend thatthe count will be too low by far. And the Census Bureau doesn't denythat, saying that it will seek only to deliver demographic, socialand economic data on components of the homeless population.   It won't be a comprehensive survey and the numbers will beconservative, meaning it will err on the low side. But whatever theflaws, it will be the first major effort to count the homeless sincetheir plight became a national political issue.   That's why the arguments began early. Estimates of the number ofhomeless people in the United States range from 250,000 to 3million. With that margin of error, numbers are meaningless.   Activists demanding new and more extensive programs for thehomeless came up with the guess that there are 3 million of them, anumber that never has been substantiated but nevertheless is used inthe debate over action for the homeless.   In May, 1984, the Department of Housing and Urban Developmentreported after a six-month study of homelessness that the bestestimate of the number of homeless was 250,000 to 350,000. PresidentBush said during the 1988 campaign that a 1986 Harvard studysupported the higher of the HUD figures, 350,000. An Urban Institutereport in 1988 estimated the number of homeless at 567,000 to600,000. That also was criticized as too low by advocates for thehomeless.   The numbers send a political signal, and that puts the census inthe middle of the debate.   A sociologist and a housing expert contend the whole thing shouldbe called off. They contend the administration should ``forget aboutcounting the uncountable,'' and seek more money for housing programs.   ``We believe the census will severely undercount the homeless,pulling the rug out from under the few programs that presentlyexist,'' say Richard P. Appelbaum of the University of California atSanta Barbara, and Peter Dreier, director of housing for the BostonRedevelopment Authority.   ``The number of homeless people has become a politicalfootball,'' they contend in an article in the Chicago Tribune. ``TheBush administration, like its predecessor, does not like to think ofthe problem as too big or too costly. Small problems require smallnumbers, and small numbers apparently require large studies.''   On the other side of the argument, an urban planner writing in aconservative journal says the homeless lobby cooked up phony numbersin order to push its demands.   ``Prominent individuals and organizations acting on behalf of thehomeless have argued that not simply hundreds of thousands, butmillions of Americans on any given day are resigned to a life inshelters, institutions or the streets,'' says Carl F. Horowitz.   ``Beginning around 1983, the number 3 million _ approximately 1.2of every 100 Americans _ has come to be reported as the benchmarkfigure. Politicians, celebrities and corporations have found it aconvenient rallying point to elicit sympathy and tax deductiblecontributions for the homeless.''   In an article published by the Heritage Foundation, Horowitztraces the number to a 1982 study by Mary Ellen Hombes, now with theNational Coalition for the Homeless, and Mitch Snyder, whoseCommunity for Creative Non-Violence issued the report.   Their study concluded that about 2.2 million Americans werehomeless in 1980, and said the number ``could reach 3 million ormore during 1983.'' Snyder later said in congressional testimonythat the numbers were meaningless. The far lower HUD estimates alsowere dismissed as meaningless during House hearings on the subject.   Horowitz says a sound count of the homeless, and information onthe problems behind their homelessness, are vital in shapingpolicies that can help them. ``Advocates who disparage researchabout their numbers are doing a serious injustice to the people theyostensibly are trying to aid,'' he says.   Now the Census Bureau will try to produce meaningful figures,counting the homeless in shelters and cheap hotels and then, aftermidnight, on the streets. Census workers will seek to interview thepeople they find in shelters and on the streets to get demographicdata on the homeless population. But they won't awaken any sleepingstreet people. In those cases, they'll guess age, sex and race.   ``We are measuring components of the homeless on one night, notthe dynamics of homelessness,'' the Census Bureau said in astatement describing its survey. ``... We expect that the count ofthe street component will be very conservative. A general-purposesurvey such as the census cannot provide comprehensive data on thehomeless.''   Those caveats notwithstanding, next year's numbers are certain tostir a new round of debate on how many Americans really arehomeless, and what the government should do about it.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
