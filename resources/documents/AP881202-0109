In a joint release, the departments of Commerce and of Housingand Urban Development said sales increased to a seasonally adjustedannual rate of 733,000 units, the highest level in 20 months.   Adding to the robust picture, the government sharply revised itsSeptember figure to a 1.4 percent drop, up from the previouslyestimated minus 7.8 percent.   Last year, most economists were expecting 1988 sales to be loweras interest rates rose. However, sales in the first 10 months of theyear are a slight 0.2 percent higher than the same period last year.   Fixed-rate mortgages did rise from March through mid-August, buteased until early November before starting to climb again.Adjustable-rate mortgages, however, have risen steadily since thespring and now are nearly as high as before the October 1987 stockmarket crash.   This week, the average rate, excluding add-on fees known aspoints, was 10.44 percent for fixed-rate loans and 8.26 percent forthe most popular type of one-year adjustable rate mortgages, thosewith caps on how high the interest can go, according to the FederalHome Loan Mortgage Corp. Both were slightly higher than a weekearlier.   ``I think this is probably about as good as it gets,'' MichaelCarliner, an economist with the National Association of HomeBuilders, said of the sales rate. ``We have seen interest ratesrising over the past few weeks and the rate of economic growth islikely to slow somewhat.''   Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Associationof America, attributed this year's unexpected strength in thehousing market to the willingness of home purchasers to use eitherfixed- or adjustable-rate mortgages, depending on which was thebetter deal.   ``Consumers have switched back and forth ... such that theweighted average for mortgage rates has held steady at about 9.5percent since the beginning of 1987,'' he said.   By region, sales rose 14.6 percent in the Northeast to an annualrate of 110,000 units, 8.1 percent in the Midwest to a 107,000 unitrate and 5.1 percent in the West to 266,000. In the South, salesfell 3.9 percent to an annual rate of 249,000.   The rate in the West, boosted by strong population growth inCalifornia, has not been higher since March 1979, when 279,000 homeswere sold.   For the year, sales in the West are running about 12 percenthigher. They're holding steady in the Midwest and South. In theNortheast, they're running about 9 percent lower, which economistsattribute to high prices.   The median price of new homes nationally fell 0.9 percent inOctober to $115,900, meaning half sold for more and half for less.That followed a 6.4 percent increase in September.   The average price, which is pulled up by very expensive homes,fell 2.1 percent to $140,100 after an identical increase a monthearlier.   The median was 8.8 percent higher than a year ago, while theaverage was 11.4 percent more.</TEXT></DOC>
