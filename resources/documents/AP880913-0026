(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A wind-whipped fire racing throughthe Gold Rush country of the Sierra Nevada foothills Mondaydestroyed 138 homes and other structures and forced more than 8,000people to evacuate.   Some 4,500 residents of the Lake Wildwood area, where somehouses cost $1 million, were forced from their homes twice in thepast two days as the out-of-control wildfire raged through ruggedterrain.   Late Monday, hundreds more were ordered from the communities ofSmartville, Rough and Ready and Penn Valley, said state Office ofEmergency Services spokesman David Sandino, bringing to 3,500 thenumber evacuated from that area in two days.   Two firefighters were injured and others had to dive for coveras capricious winds drove the fire through timber and dry brushabout 60 miles northeast of Sacramento, or about 150 milesnortheast of San Francisco.   The latest evacuations were ordered after the fire's 70-footflames jumped a highway and headed southwest, threatening hundredsof scattered rural dwellings.   ``There are hundreds here and they are pouring in,'' said RedCross worker Elizabeth Quirk, at the Nevada Union High Schoolevacuation center. ``The school buses are bringing in seniorcitizens, and there are campers and motor homes in the parkinglot.''   By late Monday, the blaze dubbed the 49er Fire had burned anestimated 15,000 acres, or nearly 25 square miles, of westernNevada County. Flames threatened the high technology Grass ValleyGroup, the county's largest employer with 1,000 workers.Authorities said the fire reached three sides of the company'sgrounds, and that a storage shed had been burned.   The Yuba County Board of Supervisors met in emergency session inMarysville to declare the zone a local disaster area, and expressedconcern that the fire may threaten Beale Air Force Base nearMarysville, 20 miles to the west of the fire and the home base ofthe SR-71 ``Blackbird'' spy plane.   The blaze was fueled by drought-dry brush, wood shake roofs andpropane tanks which exploded like small bombs in the intense heat,said state Department of Forestry spokesman Charlie Jakobs.   The destroyed structures were valued at $9 million, according tothe U.S. Forest Service. Along with 84 homes, 54 outbuildings alsowere razed, said Ann Westling, a Forest Service spokeswoman. Shesaid the figure represented only a preliminary estimate of lossesand that it could climb higher.   Two firefighters were burned when their truck was caught inflames. One suffered leg burns, was wrapped in wet gauze and takenby helicopter to a nearby hospital. The other man was treated atthe scene.   About 40 men in two fire crews were forced to use their portablefire shelters when wind shifted suddenly and swept the flames overthem.   Flames engulfed a bulldozer, forcing the operator to wraphimself in an asbestos blanket and take refuge under the vehicle.   It was one of 11 fires that destroyed nearly 30,000 acres oftimber and brush in five rural California counties Monday.   Residents of this affluent mountain town of 4,500 people 45miles northeast of Sacramento and the tiny town of Rough and Readywere evacuated Sunday, and Highway 49 was closed.   They were allowed to begin returning home Monday morning, butwere ordered evacuated again later.   Smartville, evacuated later, is about 15 miles west of theNevada City-Grass Valley area, the largest communities in theregion. Penn Valley and Lake Wildwwood are about six miles west ofNevada City.   A force that had grown to 1,700 firefighters saved the majorityof the resort homes, but flames destroyed 13 large resort homes,five boats and a dock. Nineteen other structures outside of theLake Wildwood area were destroyed, including several residentialtrailers and agricultural buildings.   It skipped through the community, burning yards and oak treesbetween large houses, some valued at $1 million.   In some places, flames reached the town lake, igniting marinarailings, several boats and a dock.   ``I was coming back from the Bahamas, sitting in San FranciscoInternational Airport, and I see my father's house burning ontelevision,'' said insurance agent Don Sanzone, 41. He said the3,000-square-foot home was destroyed even though it was separatedfrom the forest by pavement.   ``It's amazing, one burns down right in between others thatdon't, and this one that burned had a tile roof.'' said FesVenardi, 67, who lives two house away from one destroyed home.   ``I never thought this would happen,'' Sanzone said. ``I didn'tthink there was enough underbrush, but the wind was blowing sobad.''   Wind was estimated at 25 to 30 mph Monday throughout most ofnorthern California, but higher gusts were reported on the firelines.   ``The wind is our biggest enemy out here today,'' said Jakobs.``We had a solid front of fire about a half-mile long moving at arapid rate through dense brush and timber.''   The 49er fire reportedly started along Highway 49 _ named forthe 1849 Gold Rush towns it winds among _ about six miles north ofNevada City by a transient burning toilet paper.   The fire spread southwest away from the nearest populated areas.But pushed by gusting winds, it quickly skipped in a matter ofhours over nearly 10 miles of unpopulated foothills to the poshLake Wildwood area.   A second Nevada County fire burned along Highway 49 in an areaof brush, light timber and scattered homes midway between GrassValley and Auburn.   Most schools were closed in the region. Thick smoke made itunsafe to operate school buses, and the Red Cross converted atleast three schools into temporary evacuation centers.   The Lake Wildwood residents, some of whom fought alongside firecrews, were first pulled out Sunday. They were allowed to returnearly today only to be ordered out later, said Jakobs.   State Department of Forestry information officer John Cartersaid about 5,000 state, federal and local firefighters werebattling nine other timber and brush fires Monday, mostly in remoteareas. No homes were destroyed in any of those blazes.</TEXT></DOC>
