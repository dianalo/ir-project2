(HP) and Silicon Graphics Inc.andP;  Each isdeveloping a proprietary, object-oriented graphical environment from theground up.andM;Unix GUIs are sophisticated programs that push the current technologyenvelope.andP;  This is partly because Unix has a huge, built-in Randamp;D communityrooted in universities and research labs.andP;  The Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology of Cambridge Mass., which developed the X Window System, isstudying the fundamental relationship between man and machine.andP;  CarnegieMelon University in Pittsburgh, another Unix hotbed, has some of the foremostspeech-recognition researchers in the world.andP;  Such leading-edge technologieswill most likely be introduced to the commercial marketplace initiallythrough Unix systems.andM;Another reason Unix delivers some of the industry's most exciting GUI goodsis because most Unix systems offer horsepower not commonly found on PCs:on-screen PostScript, 24-bit color, networked image servers and million-pixelmonitors are all standard configurations for Unix workstations.andM;Although Unix's ability to compute occurs behind the scenes, tapping intothis computational power should be as simple as possible for the user.andM;That's where Unix GUIs come in.andP;  To help users understand what the computeris doing, interface developers should try to provide as much feedback aboutuser actions as possible.andM;Ideally, a user's action should receive a response from the computer,preferably one that describes what it is doing.andP;  A familiar example is AppleComputer Inc.'s Macintosh stopwatch cursor, which indicates that the usermust wait until the computer has completed an operation.andM;Unix is becoming more appealing to business users due to its inherent poweras an operating system and the emerging crop of low-priced workstationsfeaturing the operating system.andP;  This year, the cost of many Unix-basedcomputers has dropped within the price range of most business users.andP;  SunMicrosystems Inc. and NeXT offer 13-and 15-million-instruction-per- second(mips) workstations, respectively, for less than $5,000.andP;  IBM offers anRS/6000 system running at 27 mips for a lower price than a comparablyoutfitted PS/2 Model 80 running at 3 mips.andM;Unix systems offer a favorable price/performance ratio, but even with thecurrent GUI technology, their ease of use -- especially regardingapplications software -- is still a critical issue for Unix acceptance in thecorporate mainstream.andM;Unix does not have a GUI heritage.andP;  It was designed around text and thecommand line.andP;  Its inventors, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, originallysold their idea for Unix to Bell Labs as a &quot;text processor.&quot; They integratedthe C programming language into Unix, using it as the general interface inthe C shell.andM;Searching for C ShellsandM;Inexperienced programmers usually start with a high-level language like BASICor COBOL.andP;  They then move on to Pascal or FORTRAN and eventually, if theyplow far enough, they get to C. The C language can be described politely asesoteric; the C shell is easier than programming but far from simple.andP;  Itlets programmers automate procedures using syntax similar to the C languagewithout having to compile and link the program.andM;Today most Unix graphical user interfaces are a compromise -- at some level-- between the programmers, engineers and computer scientists who like the Cshell and the commercial market that wants the ease of a graphicalenvironment.andM;This compromise has evolved into Unix's two principal graphical systems:Motif and ATandamp;T's System V release 4 Open Look.andP;  Both Unix GUIs run on top ofthe X Window System, allowing GUIs to work across networks transparently andon terminals with relatively little computing power of their own.andM;Like IBM's Common User Access (CUA), Motif and Open Look are specificationsfor interface design, with one exception: They also have graphical objectlibraries, such as pre-written windows, and programmers can writeapplications to access these graphical object libraries.andM;Motif and Open Look are not complete graphical environments like Windows orthe Macintosh's operating environment, because they lack file-management andsystem controls.andP;  They can, however, be combined with third- party offeringsto provide a full-featured graphical system.andM;There is a small but rapidly growing set of graphical Unix applications forthese environments.andP;  Open Look and NeXT's NextStep each have 50 to 60 majorapplications, including spreadsheets and publishing software.andP;  Motif trailsbehind with about 20.andM;Some common applications for these interfaces are FrameMaker, a high-enddesktop publishing application sold by Frame Inc., and Wingz, a spreadsheetby Informix Software Inc.andM;One Unix application domain that GUIs and the mouse have not yet conquered isnetwork management, where the C shell still reigns over most of theadministrator's duties.andP;  All the major vendors have development teams workingon GUIs for network managers, but Silicon Graphics and HP are the onlycompanies that currently have products on the market.andM;X Windows has been very influential in the development of GUIs forworkstations.andP;  X Windows is a protocol for distributed graphics applicationsthat lets an application run on one machine while requesting graphicaluser-interaction services from any other system on a network.andM;Workstations typically are characterized by few criteria -- they use Unix ora Unix-like operating system, they can perform multiple millions ofinstructions per second, and they have high-resolution monitors.andM;Standard Unix monitors have a resolution of 1,170 by 780 pixels, usually at72 dots per inch for accurate font rasterization and room to take fulladvantage of a multitasking windowing system.andM;Many Unix systems, most notably those from NeXT and Silicon Graphics, usedirect manipulation frequently, which is another aspect of a GUI.andM;When a window is moved, the entire image of the window also moves, not justthe outline of the box.andM;Direct manipulation will probably be a GUI standard within a few years.andO;Following this trend is Windows 3.0, which already provides directmanipulation in some text fields.andM;Sun Microsystems, the primary developer of Open Look, also created OpenWindows, an extension of Open Look that is a full graphical environment.andM;Open Windows insulates the user from 90 percent of Unix.andP;  Based on Sun'sSunView GUI, Open Windows comes standard on Sun computers with a basic filemanager and a set of system controls.andM;Because Sun Microsystems has the largest share of the workstation market,application development is substantial.andM;Open Look consists of a set of guidelines and three programming kits.andP;  Two ofthe kits, XView and Xt+, are interface development kits for X Windowssystems.andP;  The third kit is the Network Extensible Windowing System (NeWS), agraphics model based on PostScript, used for applications that need a highlevel of WYSIWYG, such as desktop publishing.andP;  Although it's not an Adobeproduct, NeWS complies with Adobe's PostScript specifications.andM;As an interface, Open Look is somewhat different from Mac and PC-based GUIs.andO;All three buttons on the mouse are used regularly and can be configured bythe user.andP;  Although menus are not required to be available at all times, someapplications include them in the window.andP;  Window-control menus pop up byclicking on the title bar.andP;  Application-specific menus are available byclicking in the work space of a window, and system menus come up by clickingon the desktop.andM;A nice feature of Open Look is its drag-and-drop capability.andP;  This allows auser to move a file onto a symbolic object to initiate an action.andP;  Forexample, moving a file onto a printer icon would initiate printing.andM;Motif is Open Look's rival for the Unix graphical interface standard.andP;  OSFhas said its aim is to create an open Unix standard not tied to any specificvendor, and to deliver a GUI, which they accomplished with Motif.andP;  The OSF'sOSF/1 Unix is now available, but Motif is already used by a number ofapplication vendors.andM;Motif is a hybrid that includes Digital Equipment Corp.'s (DEC's) DECwindowsinterface language, the behavior of Microsoft Corp.'s Presentation Managerand the beveled, 3-D look of HP's Visual Users Environment (VUE).andM;Motif is designed to be operated via one mouse button.andP;  Menus can be accessedfrom a menu bar on the window.andP;  The Motif style guide discourages developersfrom using pop-up menus, like those in Open Look, in their programs.andP;  Motif'sWindows architecture and controls are similar to the Presentation Managerinterface, making it easy to learn for users of OS/2 or Windows.andM;Motif has no file manager or system controls of its own.andP;  The two majorcontenders for file-system managers are Looking Glass from Visix SoftwareInc. and IXI X.desktop from IXI Ltd., a Motif interface with controls forbasic file management.andP;  Motif and Open Look reside on Unix workstations, butSCO Open Desktop, from The Santa Cruz Operation Inc., is the most popularUnix GUI for PCs.andP;  SCO Open Desktop is also based on the Motif interface andprovides basic system controls.andM;Looking Glass provides the full-featured desktop functionality that ismissing in Motif.andP;  It graphically displays files and directories, launchesapplications, manages files using extended file attributes and sets systempreferences like color, printer control and application execution.andM;A number of workstation vendors, including DEC, Intergraph Corp., MotorolaInc. and Data General Corp., are bundling Looking Glass as the environmentmanager for their workstations.andM;Taking the NeXT StepandM;Taking a different road from most of the other Unix vendors is NeXT, whichhas been dedicated from its outset to a graphical Unix environment.andM;Its NextStep graphical system has a complete built-in developmentenvironment.andP;  NeXT uses Carnegie Melon's Mach, a small, fast version of Unixthat is well-suited for multitasking and heavy graphics.andP;  NeXT also opted forDisplay PostScript system instead of X Windows because of its extensivegraphics feature set and a unified printing and viewing model.andM;NextStep also uses the Objective C programming environment from StepstoneInc. for a totally object-oriented system.andP;  NextStep is an easy environmentfor developing graphical applications, and it boasts a large, growing base ofapplications software rivaling that of Open Look.andM;NextStep is a proprietary environment available primarily on NeXT machines.andO;It is also being licensed by IBM for its RS/6000 line of RISC computers, tobe offered as a graphical environment along with Motif.andM;Graphically, NextStep works more like the Macintosh than any other graphicaluser interface.andM;Menus are always visible on-screen, although they appear as a list on a panelinstead of on a menu bar across the top of the screen.andP;  The two-buttonedmouse uses one button to initiate all on-screen activity and usermanipulation.andP;  The user can configure the other button to bring up the menupanel under the pointer, and set the right or left button as the primarybutton.andM;Frequently used applications are always available on the screen, in the listof icons.andP;  One of the icons is a file-deletion utility, the NeXT equivalentof the Macintosh's trash can, in the form of a recycler icon.andM;Silicon Graphics has a very robust, proprietary graphical system that offersthe same kinds of features found in NextStep, and Hewlett-Packard plans tooffer such features in a future proprietary system.andM;As the first commercial Unix vendor to adopt a GUI, Silicon Graphics hasquietly become a $400 million company by concentrating on graphics.andP;  Itsenvironment basically was written to be graphical.andM;As with NeXT, Silicon Graphics wrote its entire environment in anobject-oriented language -- in this case, C++.andP;  This provides a system-levelmessaging paradigm.andM;Silicon Graphics provides direct manipulation throughout the system in agraphical environment that combines X Windows, PostScript through the NeWSsystem and its own proprietary 3-D graphics library.andP;  Monitors come only incolor, and every machine has a proprietary graphics engine to accelerategraphics creation.andP;  Unlike most other GUIs, the graphical environment is notbit-mapped.andP;  All graphics have descriptions that are rendered on-the-fly intoa bit map by the graphics engine.andM;Although Silicon Graphics has developed its own environment, its stated goalis to make its systems compliant with Motif.andP;  This would allow Motifapplications to be ported to Silicon Graphics machines without modifying theinterface.andM;However, to take full advantage of the unique graphics capabilities of aSilicon Graphics workstation, it is still necessary to use the SiliconGraphics Library calls, which are not normally used by Motif.andM;Silicon Graphics' graphical system uses a three-button mouse; the right andleft buttons are used regularly.andP;  The left button is used to manipulateobjects, and the right button is used to access menus.andP;  The right button isused to access commands via pop-up menus.andP;  The Windows controls are similarto Motif's.andM;Silicon Graphics also provides a desktop manager called Workspace.andP;  It uses asemi-3-D field with file icons and directories linked together by lines,somewhat like a hierarchical tree.andP;  Workspace also provides for real-timedisplay of files, so network activity is always apparent.andM;Silicon Graphics is also the furthest along in developing a graphical networkmodel.andP;  Its NetVisualyzer software provides real-time visual analysis ofnetwork activity.andM;HP, like IBM, is hedging its bets on a number of interfaces.andP;  It is aprominent member of OSF and a contributor to Motif.andP;  HP uses VUE, developedby its Apollo subsidiary.andP;  And HP's stated goal is to provide a Unix versionof NewWave, HP's object-oriented system for personal computers.andP;  Motif andVUE are available now, but HP has not set a release date for NewWave forUnix.andM;Motif is an industry-standard, X Window-compliant system.andP;  VUE is part of theApollo Domain/OS, which provides powerful networking capabilities.andP;  NewWavewill provide a consistent user interface and an object-oriented system forall HP platforms.andM;HP may try to integrate these systems into one consistent interface oroperating system, but for now it offers each of these solutions separately.andM;It is difficult to talk about GUIs without mentioning Apple's Macintosh.andP;  TheMacintosh's success spurred industrywide acceptance of GUIs, and mostgraphical user interfaces borrow ideas from the Macintosh system.andM;Apple's A/UX operating system provides Unix services for Macintosh users.andO;Most Macintosh applications run on top of A/UX without any modification, andthe Mac interface is reserved for most system functions, including choosingprinters, moving files and setting system parameters.andP;  Both Motif and OpenLook applications are available for the Macintosh through X Windows.andM;All of the Unix vendors are developing and extending their interfaces.andP;  Theyhave committed to providing multimodal interfaces that incorporate sound,video and animation as methods.andM;Sun, Silicon Graphics and NeXT computers all have sound ports.andP;  NeXT has evenincluded Motorola's DSP56001 digital signal processor, a powerfulsound-processing subsystem, on all its machines.andP;  Silicon Graphics ananimated interface, and a real-time video display is available for Sun, DEC,NeXT and Silicon Graphics systems.andM;Unix workstations are 32-bit- native, so they have an advantage over personalcomputers, which are still struggling to pull away from the 8088 and DOS.andP;  Asa result, Unix is especially well-suited for the power-intensive requirementsof today's GUIs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
