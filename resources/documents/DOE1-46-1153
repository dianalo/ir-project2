<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-46-1153 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have measured convoy electrons produced by the passage of light ions(H/sup +/ at 150, 200, 250 keV/u and He/sup +/ at 100, 150, 200 keV/u)through equilibrium thickness carbon foils (rhox=5 {mu}g/cm/sup 2/) incoincidence with the charge states q/sub f/=0, 1 resp. q/sub f/=0, 1,2 of the outgoing projectiles. All charge state fractions were registeredsimultaneously by a position sensitive parallel-plate-avalanche detector(PPAD). The yield of coincident convoy electrons Y/sub c/(q/sub f/) isnormalized to the same number of outgoing probjectiles and mirrors thefraction of the emergent ions of each charge state q/sub f/. The FWHMof the coincident convoy electron peak is found to be independent ofq/sub f/. A transport length {lambda}/sub c/ for convoy electrons inthe range of the mean free path of free electrons is deduced from thedata. This result is in contradiction with recent measurements for D/sup+/ (150 keV/u).</TEXT></DOC>
