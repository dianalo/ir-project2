Dave Moorcroft was the world record-holder at the distance, butinjuries had destroyed his chances of winning in Los Angeles.   As Moorcroft fell farther and farther behind, Greenspan told hiscameramen to focus on the British runner.   ``They said, `Are you sure? He's last,''' Greenspan recalled.``And I said, `I know, just do it.' They thought I was crazy.''   Like a fox.   Moorcroft's battle to avoid being lapped by the winner, SaidAouita, is one of the memorable moments in ``16 Days of Glory,''Greenspan's six-hour documentary on the 1984 Games. It will bebroadcast in one-hour segments on public television beginningWednesday night.   The film features such well-known athletes as gymnast Mary LouRetton, track star Carl Lewis and diver Greg Louganis. What makesit special, however, are the athletes and stories that were ignoredor slighted in ABC's vast coverage of the 1984 Games.   ``I'm not just interested in winners,'' Greenspan said. ``Often,the losers make a better story.''   Greenspan, 61, has chronicled both in his career.   Since forming his film company in 1967, the former sportscasterhas written, produced and directed documentaries and televisionspecials on subjects ranging from the Heisman Trophy to the earlydays of baseball. He has also written several books and recorded 19spoken-word albums.   But his main passion is making movies about the Olympics.   Greenspan and his late wife, Cappy, won Emmy awards for ``TheOlympiad'' television series. ``Wilma,'' his 1977 TV movie on thelife of Olympic champion Wilma Rudolph, got rave reviews and highratings. And he's just completed his latest Olympic project, theofficial film of the 1988 Winter Olympics.   Greenspan's love affair with the Olympics began with the 1948Games in London.   One of the competitors that year was Karoly Takacs of Hungaria,a former pistol shooting champion whose right hand _ the one heshot with _ was shattered by a grenade in 1938.   ``He was so despondent he contemplated suicide,'' Greenspansaid. ``But in 1948, there he was, in London, and he won the goldmedal in pistol shooting. He had learned to shoot with his lefthand.''   That's the kind of human-interest story that excites Greenspanand gives his Olympic shows a distinct flavor.   ``16 Days of Glory'' includes segments on Japanese judo championYasuhiro Yamashita, who overcame a painful leg injury to win a goldmedal; U.S. runner Henry Marsh, who competed in the steeplechasewith a serious viral infection, and American swimmer John Moffet,who hurt his leg while qualifying for the 100-meter freestyle.   ``I'm interested in people, not statistics,'' Greenspan said.``I don't care about 10.2 dashes and .365 batting averages. I'm astoryteller. I want to make a connection between the athlete andthe audience.''   ``16 Days of Glory'' reflects Greenspan's idealistic view of theOlympics. The Soviet bloc boycott is mentioned only briefly, as isthe controversial Mary Decker-Zola Budd collision. In the women's3,000-meter race, Decker fell after tripping over Budd's trailingleg as the South African runner moved in front of the American.Greenspan prefers to shine his spotlight on Maricica Puica, theRomanian runner whose victory was overshadowed by Decker's fall.   ``I'm not naive. I know about the politics and thecontroversy,'' Greenspan said. ``But I would rather concentrate onthe athletes and the competition. That's what I do best.''   It took years of research, a first-rate crew and a million feetof film to make the 1984 Olympics film.   ``Logistically, it's like putting together the Normandyinvasion,'' Greenspan said. ``You do as much pre-production aspossible, but a lot of it is never used. We threw out about 80percent of the stuff we filmed before the Games.''   While Greenspan awaits the TV premiere of ``16 Days of Glory,''he is busy working on two other Olympic programs _ a docudrama onthe 1936 Berlin Games and a television special that followsteen-age athletes as they trained for the 1988 Games in South Korea.   Despite tight security in Seoul, some people are afraid theGames could be marred by terrorism or student riots. Greenspan, whojust returned from the South Korean capital, said the fears areunfounded.   ``It's safer than Central Park,'' he said.</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   TRACEY FLIES _ Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``The Tracey Ullman Show''will be shown on Trans World Airlines flights beginning this month.TWA passengers on some domestic and all transAtlantic flights willsee the ``skitcom,'' as will passengers on flights from Europe tothe Middle East.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, July 18</NOTE></DOC>
