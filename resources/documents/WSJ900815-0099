Vigilant as she might have been about governments thatpersecute, Mrs. Pilon could not have imagined the nightmareshe and her husband, Roger, would endure because of the U.S.government, because of the Justice Department no less.   The story of what happened to the Pilons is partly a taleof how people in Washington can be victims of &quot;ethics&quot;charges. They were falsely and publicly cited in an ethicsreport by the Justice Department for the serious crime ofleaking classified documents to the South African government.The most curious aspect of the case is that this report wasissued after the Justice Department had cleared the Pilons.   To his credit, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh last monthapproved an apology to the Pilons and an unprecedented$25,000 settlement. On the other hand, the problem remains ofunexplained misfeasance -- or malfeasance -- by ethicsofficers whose power shields them from internal scrutiny.   The Pilons were central-casting quality young Reaganites.They met as philosophy graduate students at the University ofChicago. When they came to Washington, Mr. Pilon served inseveral positions, including head of Justice's Asylum Policyand Review office. The trouble began in 1987 when Mrs. Pilon,who was at the Heritage Foundation, was nominated to becomean assistant secretary of the interior. There was a problemin her background check. The FBI set up simultaneous butseparate interviews with the Pilons, demanding to know if Mr.Pilon had leaked to his wife a State Department document,&quot;Report to Congress on Communist Influence in South Africa.&quot;She was asked if she then passed it on to a South Africandiplomat.   Both denied the accusations, but according to the Pilons,officers from Justice's ethics office, the Office ofProfessional Responsibility, told Mr. Pilon his securityclearance had been lifted and he was put on leave. Mrs.Pilon's nomination was eventually withdrawn. Finally, thePilons say, ethics chief Michael Shaheen told Mr. Pilon toresign or be fired. The Pilons' lawyer, Terrance O'Donnell,proposed that he be allowed to see the evidence and produce aclassified rebuttal.   Mr. O'Donnell's report went all the way to AttorneyGeneral Edwin Meese, who ordered a review of the allegations.In September 1988, a top Justice aide, Dee Benson, sent aletter dropping all charges and reinstating Mr. Pilon. Theletter said &quot;no implications adverse to you should be taken,&quot;thanking him for &quot;the outstanding cooperation and patienceyou have demonstrated.&quot; Mrs. Pilon, who now runs the NationalForum Foundation, guesses that the FBI wiretapped aconversation in which she offered a South African diplomat acopy of a Heritage Foundation study about Soviet activity atthe United Nations.   Mr. Pilon, who is now with the CATO Institute, recallsthat the investigation &quot;was so psychologically debilitatingbecause we were never told what the problem was, and so werealways flailing at shadows.&quot; The most bizarre aspect of whatthe Pilons call their Kafkaesque experience is that it onlygot worse after the charges were dropped.   This past November, Mr. Shaheen's office issued its annualreport on ethics investigations. It described four&quot;representative&quot; investigations of the more than 400conducted during the year. The first described a Justicelawyer who &quot;was the subject of a foreign counterintelligenceinvestigation.&quot; The report said the investigation found &quot;thatsufficient cause existed to terminate his politicalapppointment.&quot; No names were used, but reporters quicklylearned it referred to Mr. Pilon. This was the first publicmention of the case.   The Pilons were outraged. Mr. Pilon told a congressionalcommittee that power had &quot;corrupted&quot; Mr. Shaheen. Mr.Thornburgh had his deputy, Donald Ayer, investigate. Thispast March the Pilons were cleared for the second time, withMr. Ayer noting that Mr. Pilon had returned to his job&quot;unconditionally.&quot; Mr. Ayer then sent a follow-up letter inApril saying that &quot;the OPR report was erroneous in certainparticulars, but that Michael Shaheen and OPR cannot befaulted in any way.&quot; This did more than leave open thequestion of whose fault it was. Mr. Ayer was soon forced toresign in part, according to Mr. Thornburgh's aides, becausehe had no authorization to clear Mr. Shaheen.   Mr. Thornburgh ordered a third review of the case. Thelatest apology plus the cash settlement was issued byAssistant Attorney General Stuart Gerson, who says Justicewanted to &quot;do the fair thing&quot; by covering the Pilons' legalcosts.   The mystery remains how the ethics office could haveissued a report smearing the Pilons. Ethics officials knewthe details of the case. Mr. Benson, who is now the U.S.Attorney in Utah, confirms that he had informedrepresentatives from the ethics office back in September1988, that the investigation of the Pilons had ended with noevidence of wrongdoing.   If Mr. Shaheen issued the annual report despite knowledgethat Mr. Pilon had been cleared, this might be a case of J.Edgar Shaheen. Mr. Shaheen has been the only director of thepost-Watergate ethics office, which was formed in 1976.Longevity may breed a dangerous insularity. Mr. Shaheen didnot return phone calls.   No one at the Justice Department seems very interested indigging deeper to find out how the false ethics report couldhave been issued. They may not want to be accused of somehowinterfering. Or maybe they fear being smeared themselves; theethics office has initiated investigations of several pastattorneys general. It's worth noting, though, that Mr.Shaheen's office may be redundant. Last year, Congress forcedseveral departments, including Justice, to create an officeof inspector general to investigate alleged wrongdoing.   Mr. Pilon would like to get to the bottom of all this andsays, &quot;it is appalling that there are not betterinstitutional protections against this kind of abuse.&quot; Mrs.Pilon's book meanwhile will be published this year in Romaniaand Poland. Maybe she should add a postscript reminding thenewly liberated countries that justice does not always comeeasily even in the most advanced nations.</TEXT></DOC>
