(HP) and AST ResearchInc. said they are revising their dealer policies with an eye towardbolstering healthy prices and dealer profits.andM;And IBM, which eliminated its large-account discount program in January,announced that it too is considering a program that would tie dealerincentives to healthy pricing practices.andM;It was a humbler Businessland that appeared before Wall Street analysts lastweek to explain the company's $1.2 million loss for the fourth quarter.andM;&quot;As management, we erred in 1989,&quot; said Businessland President and CEO DavidNorman, acknowledging that the company's strategy of driving discounts to winsales backfired.andP;  By last June, he said, the company's gross margins hadfallen by two points.andM;Businessland, based in San Jose, Calif., will no longer play the discountinggame, said Norman.andP;  Faced with a customer demanding unprofitable discounts,Businessland will walk away from the sale, he said.andM;ComputerLand Corp.andP;  Chief Operating Officer Edward Anderson in Pleasanton,Calif., is advising his 760 franchisees to do the same thing.andP;  &quot;We have beentelling our dealers to pass on certain bids that are too low andunprofitable,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We have to raise prices.andP;  Our costs have gone up.andO;We have more requirements for technical support capability.andP;  We can't dobusiness the old way.&quot;andM;Businessland has implemented strict procedures preventing salespeople fromoffering steep discounts.andP;  Under its new sales compensation plan, the largerthe discount, the lower the commission.andM;Businessland's new strategy has already helped stabilize prices, said SeymourMerrin, president of PC consulting firm Merrin Information Services of PaloAlto, Calif.andP;  &quot;This is the first time in the last 18 months that there hasbeen a slight recovery of prices,&quot; he said.andM;Manufacturers are also joining in the drive to stabilize prices.andP;  HP, forexample, is discouraging dealers from listing prices in their ads for theLaserJet III by refusing to reimburse dealers for such ads.andM;IBM is considering a similar program that would tie cooperative advertisingfunds to a minimum advertised price, and AST will announce a program in thenext 60 days that will defer some dealer costs in a bid to improveprofitability.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
