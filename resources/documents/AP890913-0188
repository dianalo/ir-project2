The visit, coming as Quayle heads to Asia for 12 days, isintended to refocus attention on the nation's worst oil spill. Agrounded Exxon tanker last March dumped 11 million gallons of oilalong the state's shoreline.   Quayle will be ``briefed on the situation up there. We hope tomeet with some concerned citizens,'' as well as Coast Guard andstate officials during the 2{ hour stopover at Elmendorf Air ForceBase, said the vice president's press secretary, David Beckwith. Hesaid that it was undecided whether Quayle would meet with Exxonofficials, but that he was ``extremely interested in the company'sviews.''   Exxon has disagreed with state and federal officials throughoutthe course of the clean-up on the adequacy of the company's efforts.   ``There's still a good deal of uncertainty about the future ofthe clean-up program. We hope there's less uncertainty after weleave,'' said Beckwith.   The Alaskan stop as Quayle flies to Korea, Japan, the Philippinesand Malaysia.   President Bush had hoped to nonymity had said earlierthat administration officials convinced Bush it would not bepolitically beneficial to refocus attention on the spill, afterinitial criticism that he took too long to get the federalgovernment involved in the clean-up.   Asked about the administration position on the amount of oilstill not cleaned up, Fitzwater said ``I don't think we cancharacterize that situation. We're running into bad weather up thereand we'll have to see how things look in the fall in terms of thespill clean-up.''   Quayle and Skinner, who will not be going on the rest of Quayle'strip, will receive briefings from the clean-up coordinator, CoastGuard Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, and others on the progress ofcleaning up the March 24 spill from the Exxon Valdez tanker.   The Monday visit comes a week after an announcement by Alaskastate officials that they will continue the clean-up on a limitedscale when Exxon pulls out the last of its work crews Friday fromthe fouled coastline of Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska.   A spokesman for Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said details of thestate's follow up were being worked out but that the governor andstate Department of Environmental Conservation were expected toagree on a light, manual clean-up effort, plus research anddevelopment during the dark and stormy winter months.   The state is interested in various clean-up techniques thatinventers have proposed from coastal towns tainted by the spill.   The governor's office said the state would expect Exxon to payfor any clean-up costs it incurred.   Exxon estimates its expenses for the summer clean-up at more than$1.2 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
