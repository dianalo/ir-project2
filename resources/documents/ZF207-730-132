(interviews).andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Creating Consistency in a World of Differences GCN: How does informationmanagement at the State Department differ from other agencies?andM;CARR: The single biggest factor is that State has significant operationsoverseas.andP;  Other agencies such as the U.S.andP;  Information Agency, Commerce andthe Agency for International Development fall into the foreign affairsfamily, but State has the biggest representation overseas and the biggestpercentage of our activities overseas.andM;Our 265 posts are supported by minis, micros and a few mainframes for classicadministration and word processing.andP;  We have some substantive systems thatare unique to the State Department for visa processing, passports andassistance to citizens overseas.andM;Although processing goes on at most locations, it focuses on the big places-- Bonn, Paris, Tokyo and so on.andP;  Minicomputer installation goes down inmedium-size posts like Luxembourg.andM;Now, how do you manage a worldwide computer operation whose functionsessentially are identical?andP;  You have a configuration management problem ofrather significant proportions, because you don't want embassy A running oneversion of software and embassy B running another or modifying it for localconditions.andP;  Our need to maintain this worldwide standard is something manyother agencies don't face.andM;In systems design, we've got to take into account different factors indifferent places overseas.andM;To give you an example, more than 10 years ago I was working with some peoplefrom the Bonn embassy to design a system for inventorying non-expendableequipment.andP;  I had just come to Europe from the Middle East.andP;  I didn't seeanything in their equipment categorizations for air conditioning.andM;That's very important in the Middle East or Africa or East Asia.andP;  In Bonn,you wouldn't even think about it.andP;  Making sure your systems are designed forthe environments you face all over the world is a tricky problem.andM;GCN: What about the technologies available in other places?andM;CARR: In much of the Third World, communications are a problem.andP;  Even inplaces with satellite dishes, they have local loop problems.andP;  If yourfacility is right at the satellite, you're in great shape.andM;The ability to maintain hardware and software in those countries is shaky atbest.andP;  The State Department has had a hardware and maintenance contract withWang Laboratories Inc. for almost 10 years now.andP;  What made the contractunique was that it included operations and maintenance worldwide.andM;We've had to station equipment and a lot of spare parts in places wheremaintenance is shaky.andP;  You don't just send in a technician with a bagful ofcomputer boards -- they might get taken away from him by customs people atthe airport and you might not see them for six or eight months.andM;We have a problem stocking parts or maintenance.andM;Of course, in Third-World places, software and operating systems supporttends to be weak.andM;Employees we send over or hire there tend to be specialists by ourdefinition, but they are not for the most part hardware or softwareengineers.andP;  They tend to be systems analysts, people who have more generalcomputer or word processing skills.andM;We meet the need for more technical personnel in a number of ways.andP;  We relyand will continue to rely on software and hardware manufacturers to theextent we can.andP;  In State's new information management reorganization, we willmore and more use technical personnel who focus almost entirely oncommunications gear.andM;We'll be broadening the area of training.andP;  We expect the distinction betweencommunications personnel and systems personnel to disappear in the next fiveto 10 years, as these people cross-train into each other's skills or we justbegin to hire people with a more general skill base.andM;GCN: When State works with other agencies overseas, do you also supply theirdata communications?andM;CARR: In general, yes.andP;  There are minor exceptions but in general the StateDepartment provides automated data processing support overseas to the otheragencies, and we supply the telecommunications channels for official data.andO;That isn't to say some agencies don't have commercial circuits of varioustypes.andM;In some places agencies have their own processing capabilities.andP;  AID, forexample, is bigger than State in some posts and might own and operate its owndata processing equipment.andP;  But for administrative services, housing andprocurement and so on, State for the most part supports other agenciesoverseas in data and word processing.andM;GCN: How did your recent reorganization come about?andM;CARR: Well, it's been on people's minds since at least the early 1980s.andO;Ambassador Don Leidel formed a team to recommend how to consolidate ourinformation management functions into one organization.andM;Last year a series of task forces met and defined the functions of thevarious offices the Leidel report called for, and we've been implementingthat.andP;  We now have a transition team operating.andP;  We expect that by Novemberwe will be 100 percent operational.andM;GCN: What types of changes are you looking at?andM;CARR: We're bringing together all the organizations and individuals involvedin any aspect of information management, people who may not view themselvesas future organizational partners.andM;For example, the domestic telephone people pretty much ran their own showproviding telephone service to the department.andM;It's becoming more and more obvious that their technology is merging towardother technologies.andP;  It was logical to incorporate that office into the newIM organization.andM;The people in the Foreign Affairs Information Center, who maintain thedatabase of cables and official records back to 1973 in electronic format,clearly were an integral part of an information organization.andP;  We pretty muchdefined anyone involved in keeping, using, providing or moving information asa candidate for this reorganization.andM;We tried to look at information through its life cycle -- creation, editing,transmission, distribution, reuse and ultimately disposal or transfer to theNational Archives.andP;  It's a very broad reorganization.andM;GCN: Will it bring more responsibility to your office?andM;CARR: Yes, indeed.andP;  My office has within it the beginnings of an office ofuser services.andP;  One of the primary recommendations of the Leidel report wasthat the new organization be user-driven.andM;We are still staffing an office whose function will be to maintain liaisonwith users, and ascertain their needs and make sure the development andimplementation of information systems are responsive to those needs ratherthan technology-driven, as they often are in classic shops.andM;We have a troika leadership.andP;  There are three deputy assistant secretariesresponsible for information management.andM;My own bailiwick is information services.andP;  Bob Caffrey is responsible forsystems operations, and we're still seeking a third deputy assistantsecretary for planning and developing systems.andM;All three of us report to Sheldon Krys, the assistant secretary and thesenior designated official.andM;The Office of Information Services handles the central foreign policy recordsof the department.andP;  Prior to 1974, everything was on paper.andP;  Finally, thereis a growing office that handles public access programs, Freedom ofInformation, Privacy Act, executive orders and so on.andM;We knew it was impossible to design a finely tuned organization in theabstract, so we are committed to fine-tuning almost on a continual basis.andO;Within a year from official implementation as of Oct. 1, we're going to takea good hard look at how the organization is working and to what extent it mayneed to be modified.andP;  We think we've got it pretty close to right.andM;GCN: Most of your equipment is Wang, isn't it?andM;CARR: Yes, I would say so.andP;  That's the result of two contracts, one for dataprocessing and one for word processing when those were completely separatetechnologies.andP;  The first was let sometime in 1979, and those contracts havebeen extended.andP;  There is something like a $500 million installed base ofequipment procured through those two vehicles.andM;We now have a request for proposals on the streets for distributed systems toreplace those two [contracts].andP;  The award will be early in the next calendaryear.andP;  It's basically distributed systems -- minicomputers, PCs.andM;GCN: Is State going along with the trend toward more power for the desktopuser?andM;CARR: We definitely are going that route in some form.andP;  But one of ourphilosophies has been that we will not go into remote parts of the world withcutting-edge technologies.andP;  Local area network administration is not aself-evident kind of thing.andM;We have heavy skills in minicomputer-based networking and we are stilldeveloping skills in operation and installation of networks and PCs.andP;  Thenumber of PCs is growing very rapidly.andM;We see more and more of them connected to minicomputers, but I don't knowwhen we will get to the phase where the minicomputer will drop out of theequation.andM;In fact, I'm not sure that's where technology is leading us.andP;  But the numberof people with smart processors on their desks is going to continue to grow.andO;We are mindful of the fact that this is fairly new technology and we have tosupport it overseas.andM;To give you an example, we have hundreds of minicomputers overseas inunclassified administrative support.andP;  We have 50 or 60 classified systemsprimarily for word processing.andP;  We are just now designing the first PC LAN togo overseas for classified word processing.andP;  You are going to see more andmore PC-based and LAN systems than minicomputers on the classifiedwordprocessing side, but we're at the beginning of that process.andM;In my view, word processing has allowed a real evolution in how we dobusiness.andP;  The demand for clerical support has gone down, our budget andpersonnel ceilings have been going down, and we simply have less clericalsupport available.andM;The introduction of word processing allowed us to take this reduction withoutan impact on our operations.andP;  On the administrative support side, I think youcould say the same.andP;  It enables us to keep records of our growing presenceand to keep more accurate records with the same staff.andM;Clearly, the communications side is a major part of what we do.andP;  I haven'ttalked much about our mainframe operations.andM;We do have, as you know, a pretty good-sized mainframe center here with two[IBM Corp.] 3081s, and a coupled 4381.andP;  We have three mainframe centersoverseas that do financial processing, payroll and accounting.andM;GCN: Do you have remote processing sites in the United States?andM;CARR: At the moment, no.andP;  All our processing is done in this building, butconstruction will begin shortly on an addition to a facility in suburbanMaryland where our main communications switching now takes place.andP;  We'rebuilding an alternate site there for backup processing and load sharing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
