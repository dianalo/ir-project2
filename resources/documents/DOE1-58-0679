The Office of Emergency and Remedial Response(Superfund) uses these documents in preparing cost-benefit analyses underExecutive Order 12991 for decision making under CERCLA. All estimatesof acceptable intakes and carcinogenic potency presented in the documentshould be considered as preliminary and reflect limited resources allocatedto the project. The intent in these assessments is to suggest acceptableexposure levels whenever sufficient data are available. The interim valuespresented reflect the relative degree of hazard associated with exposureor risk to the chemical(s) addressed. Whenever possible, two categoriesof values have been estimated for systematic toxicants (toxicants forwhich cancer is not the endpoint of concern). The first, RfDS or subchronicreference dose, is an estimate of an exposure level that would not beexpected to cause adverse effects when exposure occurs during a limitedtime interval. The RfD is an estimate of an exposure level that wouldnot be expected to cause adverse effects when exposure occurs for a significantportion of the lifespan. For compounds for which there is sufficientevidence of carcinogenicity, q1*s have been computed, if appropriate,based on oral and inhalation data if available.</TEXT></DOC>
