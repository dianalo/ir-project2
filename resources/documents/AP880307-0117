The Federal Reserve said consumer credit grew at a seasonallyadjusted rate of 10.6 percent in January, following an increase of$3.98 billion in December, which translated to an annual rate of7.9 percent.   Growth in both months was greater than the 5.9 percent rate forall of 1987, which represents a considerable slowdown compared withrecent years. The rate was 10.5 percent in 1986.   The relatively strong January report is both a reflection of jobgrowth _ unemployment hit a nine-year low of 5.7 percent inFebruary _ and a sign that the rebound in consumer confidence afterthe October stock market crash is continuing, according to DavidCross, an economist with The Futures Group, a Washington consultingfirm.   ``What we're seeing right now ... is a sort of soft landing forconsumer spending,'' said Cross, whose firm is predicting growthbetween 6.5 percent and 7 percent this year. ``We're not reallylooking for a recession to occur, if anything just a bit ofslowness in the first half of the year.''   The January increase was the biggest advance since debt rose by$6.43 billion in September. The gains in both months were stronglyinfluenced by an upturn in car sales.   Auto loans rose by $1.54 billion in January, an annual rate of7.1 percent, and followed a stronger gain of 10.7 percent inDecember.   Credit card and revolving loans grew by $2.0 billion in January,a 16.5 percent annual rate, following an increase of 19.3 percent amonth earlier.   The debt category which includes bank and credit union loans notsecured by real estate grew by $1.73 billion, an 11.6 percentgrowth rate, following a decline of 3.5 percent in December.   Loans for mobile homes increased $142 million after falling $122million in December.   The various changes left total consumer debt at $617.5 billionin January.</TEXT></DOC>
