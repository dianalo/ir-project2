The action came as South Korea's security agencies and policeformed an alliance to investigate anti-government activity, andprotesters battled riot police in support of the Rev. Moon Ik-hwanand striking shipyard workers.   Police said they charged Lee Jae-oh, 45, and Koh Un, 56, withviolating security laws and jailed them for seeking unauthorizedcontact with North Korea.   Koh, a poet, was accused of attempting to take six literaryfigures to the North Korean border March 1 for unification talks.Lee, a co-chairman of South Korea's main dissident United NationalDemocratic Movement, also was charged with conspiring to planMoon's trip. Moon went to North Korea last week.   Government officials said they will arrest Moon when he returns.He left Pyonyang today and is expected to come back to Seoul viaother countries, they said.   North Korea has warned Moon's arrest would hurt its relationswith South Korea. The two Koreas maintain limited yet officialchannels of dialogue on unification of the divided peninsula andother matters.   South Korean officials say Moon's trip aids North Koreanattempts to cause unrest and discredit the Seoul government.   Dissenters in South Korea say the government is using it as anexcuse to clamp down on them.   Also today, police barred 25 dissident leaders from leaving thecountry, saying they might be wanted for investigations.   Security officials also seized hundreds of leaflets and books inraids on three Seoul offices, said sources requesting anonymity.   South Korea's police, prosecutors and officers of the Agency forNational Security Planning and the Defense Security Command todayannounced they are joining forces ``to guard the nation'sdemocratic system against all anti-state attempts by leftistforces.'' These include leftist publications and illegal contactwith North Korea, they said.   Today was the fourth day of clashes between thousands of radicalstudents and militant workers wielding firebombs, rocks and steeland wood clubs against police armed who fired tear gas to dispersedemonstrators.   There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries.   Dissidents were protesting the police storming of the HyundaiHeavy Industries Shipyard in the city of Ulsan, about 150 milessoutheast of Seoul, to end strikes that have crippled the yard forthree months.   Thousands of other students rioted in sympathy at collegecampuses in seven cities. They students command little supportamong rank-and-filed South Koreans.   Earlier reports said authorities had ended the strike to demandHyundai recognize a workers' union and increase wages.   However, Hyundai officials said today more than a quarter of theplant's 19,500 workers are either striking or sympathizing with thestrike. A newspaper said more workers had joined in other companysubsidiaries.   Lee Yong-jun, the vice minister of labor, and National Policedirector-general Cho Chung-suk flew from Seoul to Ulsan byhelicopter today to discuss the labor violence.</TEXT></DOC>
