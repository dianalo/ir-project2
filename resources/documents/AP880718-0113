The acceptance came just hours before the Security Council wasto resume debate on the U.S. Navy's downing of an Iran jetliner inthe Persian Gulf.   The secretary-general said he would begin consultations withIran and Iraq today to arrange a cease-fire and hopes it could takeeffect in a week.   ``I intend in the afternoon to start my consultations to beginto set up a D-day for the implemention for the resolution. Ofcourse, it has to begin with a cease-fire,'' said Perez de Cuellar.   He showed reporters at the U.N. Secretariat building the letterof acceptance signed by Iran's president, Ali Khamenei.   ``They say that have decided to officially declare that therepublic of Iran accepts Security Council Resolution 598,'' saidPerez de Cuellar.   When asked if Iran still insisted on punishment or denunciationof Iraq as a first step toward a cease-fire, the secretary-generalsaid:   ``There is no (such) reference in the letter. It is a veryfactual letter, there is no claim, no conditions ... It is veryclear that it is an acceptance which doesn't refer to anyconditions.''   ``It is what they (the Iranians) call `official acceptance.'They considered that before they have always tacitly accepted theresolution. Now they say, `We have officially accepted it,''' saidPerez de Cuellar.   Word of Iran's acceptance of the U.N. resolution first cametoday from that nation's Islamic Republic New Agency, which quoteda military statement. It also said Iran would not withdraw troopsfrom its borders.   Iraq already has agreed to the Security Council resolution,which passed on July 20, 1987, but Iran had not previously acceptedor rejected the resolution, claiming that Iraq must first beidentified as the aggressor in the war.   An Iraqi diplomat, U.N. counsellor Mudhafar A. Al-Amin, saidtoday that his government would have to study Iran's letter beforereacting to it. There has been no official reaction from Bagdhad.   Security Council members and guest speakers have been pressingIran to accept Resolution 598 during debate on the Iran jetlinerdisaster, which began Thursday when Vice President George Bush andIranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati presented theircountries' cases.   On Friday, Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union _ whoalong with America make up the five permanent members of theSecurity Council _ called on Iran to abide by the cease-fireresolution to end the nearly 8-year-old war.   Iran had effectively boycotted the council for eight years,contending that it favors Iraq.   In the council debate, Iran had initially called forcondemnation of America for shooting down the Iranian jetliner onJuly 3, killing all 290 peopl aboard, most of whom were Iranian.   Late last week, however, it became apparent that Iran could notmuster enough votes on the council to condemn the United States,and Iranian diplomats fell back to demanding that America acceptfull responsibility for the tragedy and that the U.S. Navy leavethe gulf region.   Iran's acceptance of the cease-fire resolution will strengthenits argument in the council that all foreign navies should leavethe region, since a cease-fire would make their presence to protectshipping unnecessary.</TEXT></DOC>
