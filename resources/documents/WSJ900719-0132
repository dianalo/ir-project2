This particular ghost was of a Swiss national who foughtwith the nation's insurgent Marxist guerrillas. Judging fromthe forensic report, the young Swiss may have been captured,tortured and executed by the Salvadoran army 19 months ago --months before Mr. Cristiani assumed the presidency. Mr.Cristiani was ready for the Swiss ambassador to bring up thedeath. Diplomats from several nations had brought similarcases to him, he said.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;They blame 70,000 deaths on me,&quot; said Mr. Cristiani,throwing up his arms in exasperation. &quot;This is a constantproblem.&quot;   As the government and the guerrillas grope toward anegotiated solution to El Salvador's 10-year-old civil war,the ghosts of the victims of that war -- in particular thoseof six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter,allegedly murdered by Salvadoran soldiers in November -- casta shadow on the future.   Nine soldiers, including Col. Guillermo Alfredo Benavides,who at the time of the killings was head of the militaryacademy here, have been arrested on murder charges. But sincetheir arrest, the investigation into the killings of theJesuits appears to have stalled. The priests were professorsat San Salvador's Central American University and key membersof the nation's intelligentsia.   Evidence that could implicate other high-ranking officershas been destroyed or lost. The missing evidence includesCol. Benavides's personal notebooks and a logbook recordingcomings and goings at the military school on the night of themurder. (The Salvadoran government says the case is movingforward, pointing to the recent detention by the military ofthe officer who destroyed the logbook. &quot;There have beenadvances,&quot; says Ernesto Altschul, vice minister of thepresidency.)   In Mexico, Miguel Saenz, a representative of the FarabundoMarti Liberation Front, the guerrillas' umbrella group thatis negotiating a cease-fire with the government, says that ifthe government can't clear up the case of the Jesuits, amongothers, then it won't be able to guarantee the guerrillas'physical safety if they put down arms and return to civilianpolitical life. &quot;How do you convince the guerrillas theywon't become the ghosts of the future?&quot; asks WilliamLeogrande, a Latin American expert at American University inWashington.   Outrage at the murders -- which many in Congress thoughtmade a mockery of the U.S. effort to turn the Salvadoranmilitary into a professional force -- and the slow pace ofthe inquiry were the main reasons that the House ofRepresentatives voted in May to cut this year's military aidto El Salvador 50%. U.S. aid to El Salvador is $315.4 millionthis year, of which $85 million is military aid.   Last month, the House approved the same level of militaryaid cuts for fiscal year 1991. The final aid cuts will besubject to negotiations between the administration andcongressional leaders, but opponents of military aid say theycount on a solid majority to cut back aid as part of a planto encourage a negotiated solution to the war. &quot;The Jesuitcase is the straw that broke the camel's back,&quot; says a Housestaffer.   Mr. Cristiani worries that such an aid reduction wouldjeopardize the current United Nations-sponsored peacenegotiations with the FMLN. For different reasons, both sidesthink the negotiations have a real chance of ending thecountry's bitter civil war.   &quot;What the {U.S.} Congress is doing is to pose thepossibility that the FMLN will take the military route,&quot; saysMr. Cristiani, as he drives a 10,000-pound armored jeepacross town.   Since the first round of negotiations in Caracas in May,the guerrillas have continued their attacks, even knockingout electricity in part of the capital on the anniversary ofMr. Cristiani's first year in office. Recently, unidentifiedgunmen killed an army major in the capital.   But even as the attacks continue, enormous pressures existon both sides to reach a negotiated peace. Internationally,the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, and theelectoral defeat of their Sandinista allies in next-doorNicaragua, have greatly isolated the guerrillas, challengingsome of their fundamental assumptions, although not theirability to wage war.   Conversely, the new era of U.S.-Soviet cooperation meansthat for the U.S., El Salvador has lost whatever strategicimportance it had. In an era of tight budgets, it becomesdifficult to justify continued U.S. involvement. &quot;The onlyproblem left is El Salvador,&quot; says Mr. Cristiani to avisiting diplomat. &quot;It's possible that the U.S. has grownbored with it.&quot;   Analysts say last year's bloody November guerrillaoffensive may have convinced both sides that the only way outis through negotiations, which are expected to resumesometime later this month. For, while the guerrillas failedto spark a mass insurrection, they nevertheless demonstratedimpressive military capacity and brought the war to thecapital's wealthy suburbs. &quot;The armed forces now sees that amilitary defeat is impossible, that it's better tonegotiate,&quot; says the FMLN's Mr. Saenz. &quot;The militaryoffensive opened up a political space for a negotiatedsolution.&quot;   But since the offensive the guerrillas have also softenedtheir demands. Both sides agreed to reach a mid-Septembercease-fire contingent on first reaching agreement on ways to&quot;demilitarize&quot; the country and instituting political andmilitary reforms. A second round of negotiations in MexicoCity failed to bring about agreement on those reforms, butboth sides say that tough issues were aired and progress wasmade. &quot;We see things with some optimism,&quot; says Mr. Altschul.&quot;We want to stop the armed encounters as quickly aspossible.&quot;   Analysts say Mr. Cristiani may not be able to deliver onthat, given strong opposition from hard-liners in the armedforces and in the ruling right-wing Arena party, where formerMaj. Roberto D'Abuisson, a charismatic politician withalleged links to death squads, holds sway. Mr. Cristianiinsists both the party and the military are ready tonegotiate in good faith. &quot;There are many people who havecriticized the armed forces,&quot; he says. &quot;They will bepleasantly surprised.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
