She opted instead for more fasionable blue leather flats, butthat didn't stop her from leading the charge up a steep pile of lavarock.   With a trail of Japanese scientists, U.S. Secret Service agents,White House staff members and reporters running to catch up, Mrs.Quayle hiked up a caldera on Mt. Mihara, the island's active volcanothat last erupted in 1987.   Nancy Reagan had drugs as her special concern, Barbara Bush hasilliteracy and Marilyn Quayle has disasters.   Friday's outing was the main event in Mrs. Quayle's naturaldisaster activities on a 5-day trip to Japan with Vice President DanQuayle.   While Quayle attended a meeting in Tokyo of the conservativeInternational Democratic Union, Mrs. Quayle toured this tiny islandof farmers and fishermen to focus attention on what she called alifelong interest in natural disaster prevention.   ``Being born and raised in Indiana, one can't help but be awareof the havoc nature, especially tornadoes, can wreak and the humandisasters that are caused,'' Mrs. Quayle said.   ``I'm pleased now that I have the opportunity to work to see thatall nations are prepared to meet natural disasters.''   Guided by seven of Japan's leading experts on volcanos, the vicepresident's wife visited the lookout station of the volcano's maincrater, the Oshima Seismic Monitoring Center, and at another cratershe forged ahead where even the experts dared not tread.   As Mrs. Quayle stepped over a rope and ventured out to get closerto the edge, Kunio Ando, of the Oshima Weather Station, hung backand marveled, ``She's very brave.''   Mrs. Quayle kept going.   ``She must come back,'' said Taiji Yoshida, director of the TokyoMeterological Observatory. ``It's dangerous.''   She walked on.   Minutes later, she returned bringing sighs of relief from staffmembers.   In November 1986, 11,000 people were evacuated from Oshima, about70 miles south of Tokyo, after hundreds of earthquakes rocked theisland and Mt. Mihara erupted, sending a stream of molten lava intothe air.   Residents of Oshima, located in an area considered one of themost volcanically active in the world, stayed off the island for amonth.   There are 77 active volcanoes in Japan. Since 1965, three peoplehave died in Japanese volcanic eruptions.</TEXT></DOC>
