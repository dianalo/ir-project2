Howard Metzenbaum is moving to blockhandgun shopping sprees by violent drug dealers by attaching hiswaiting-period proposal to a sweeping drug bill.   However, the move announced Tuesday by the Ohio Democrattriggered a skirmish at a congressional hearing with the NationalRifle Association, which says the proposal won't work.   Metzenbaum, who chaired the hearing of the Senate JudiciaryConstitution subcommittee, said drug traffickers are illegallypurchasing sophisticated, high-powered guns from legitimate dealersbecause there is no federal law to allow police to check whether apurchaser is a convicted felon or illegal alien.   ``I do not advocate, nor do I support legislation to confiscateor ban handguns from law-abiding citizens,'' said Metzenbaum. ``Butit is absurd for the federal government to stand idly by whileviolent and dangerous drug pushers arm themselves in federallylicensed and regulated gun stores.''   Metzenbaum's bill would require a seven-day waiting period priorto the purchase of a handgun to allow police time to conductbackground checks on would-be buyers. The senator said he would tryto attach it to the drug bill as an amendment when it comes beforethe full Senate.   But James Jay Baker, chief lobbyist for the NRA, said his groupopposed the bill.   ``We don't think it's going to work,'' said Baker. ``The peopleyou are trying to impact are the same ones that are going to havefalse IDs, the same ones who get their guns on the black market,not through gun stores.''   Metzenbaum told Baker that if the facts were presented honestlyto members of the NRA, he thinks most of them would support thewaiting period.   ``Unfortunately, you and the Washington lobbyists of the NRAhave not presented the case honestly to your members,'' he said.   ``I disagree with that, obviously,'' Baker replied.   Metzenbaum accused Baker of mailing NRA members a four-pageletter full of ``gross distortions'' and ``false statements.'' Thesenator said he has never called for banning the right of anylaw-abiding individual to own guns.   Baker said the first version of a Metzenbaum bill directed atplastic handguns would have banned a number of firearms.   Metzenbaum also said the NRA literature contends that thewaiting-period bill would set up a national handgun registrationsystem and that the Congressional Budget Office estimates it wouldcost law enforcement agencies $30 million to $40 million a year toimplement.   The senator said the bill requires that all forms generated bedestroyed within 60 days and that the CBO estimates are for anotherbill requiring different federal background checks.   Baker said there is nothing in the legislation that wouldprevent police from taking the information in the forms and puttingit into some centralized record-keeping file. However, heacknowledged that the cost estimate applied to a different, 14-daywaiting period proposal.   ``It was the best one we had,'' he said. ``It was an estimate.''   Baker charged Metzenbaum with running campaign ads which saidthe senator took on the gun lobby and passed a bill to outlawcop-killer bullets. Baker said the NRA in fact supported the finalbill on cop-killer bullets.   ``I don't think that the National Rifle Association is the onlyone that uses some hyperbole in their fund-raising documents,''said Baker.   Phillip McGuire, associate director of the Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms, told the subcommittee that a nationalseven-day waiting period would make it more difficult for drugdealers to buy handguns from licensed dealers.   McGuire said a drug dealer with dozens of convictions cancurrently buy an Uzi at a gun store by falsifying forms. The Uzi isdefined as a semiautomatic handgun that can fire 100 rounds aminute, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
