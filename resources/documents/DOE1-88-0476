In may cases multivariable processes canbe adequately controlled by multiple single input-single output controllers.A general framework is developed to aid the process engineer in determiningwhich output variables should be paired with which manipulated variables.In particular a new technique is presented to predict a priori when asetpoint change in one loop will affect the performance of another loop.Distillation is the most important separation process in the chemicalprocess industries. It is an energy intensive process that requires alarge percentage of the energy consumed in a typical plant. Dual compositioncontrol in distillation minimizes the energy consumption for a givenset of product specifications. The most common method that has been appliedto dual composition control is input decoupling. It was previously suggestedthat implicit decoupling can be achieved by the proper selection of aprocess measurements, which as the sum or difference of temperature measurements.This idea has motivated the research on non-interacting control systemdesign methods in distillation. This work provides a rigorous mathematicalformulation as well as a physical basis for implicit decoupling.</TEXT></DOC>
