Former Republican Gov. Pierre du Pont of Delaware was by just the other day. Vice President George Bush's son stopped over to say hello. Former Secretary of State Alexander Haig came in. Rep. Jack Kemp of New York has been sending autographed pictures.    &quot;I've gotten rather popular,&quot; says the frail woman in the delicate violet dress.    In a Georgian-style building on Amherst Street, behind a thick wooden door that still bears William Loeb's name, the widow of New Hampshire's most ferocious press baron sits in a wheelchair and takes it all in. She is trying to decide just who should be the next president of the U.S. No Democrats need apply.    With the death of Mr. Loeb six years ago, the nation's most controversial newspaper passed into the hands of a woman who learned newspapering from her grandfather, the founder of the Scripps chain. She learned politics from her husband, who referred to President Ford as &quot;Jerry the Jerk&quot; and President Eisenhower as &quot;Dopey Dwight&quot; and &quot;that stinking hypocrite.&quot; Sometimes he was even meaner.    But now, with the New Hampshire primary only months away, Mrs. Loeb, 63 years old, is tasting for the first time the peculiar power of her presses, which publish the only statewide newspaper here. She has continued the tradition of the front-page editorial -- the other day she described Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware as &quot;a master quick-switch artist when it comes to trading principles for popularity&quot; -- and is savoring the suspense revolving around her long-awaited front-page endorsement.    For months, New Hampshire political analysts have been scrutinizing the paper's every syllable. Can any candidate capture Mrs. Loeb's heart after the withdrawal of former Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada? What to make of the boomlet in positive references to Mr. du Pont? Is she too angry at Republican Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire for his aggressive questioning during the Iran-Contra hearings to look kindly on his ally and defender, Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas?    The value of the newspaper's endorsement, however, is a matter of some dispute.    Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty, Mr. Loeb's choice in 1972, never did make it to the White House. Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona lost the New Hampshire primary in 1964 to Henry Cabot Lodge despite the Loeb endorsement. Loeb backing in 1976 wasn't enough to catapult Ronald Reagan over President Ford. And although David Moore, a University of New Hampshire political scientist, argues that the Union Leader salvaged Mr. Reagan's candidacy in 1980, he has been unable to find more than a few other instances &quot;when the paper can be said to have exerted a crucial or even major role in the outcome.&quot;    Even so, the Republicans fight fiercely for the hand of Nackey Loeb -- if not in the expectation that they will win the endorsement itself, then in the possibly vain hope that a polite bearing and a kindly smile at Mrs. Loeb's door might insulate them from the frosty treatment that Mr. Bush earned in 1980. That year, not one positive story on his candidacy appeared on the front page, and he received a spate of nasty editorials (sample titles: &quot;Is Everybody Lying But George?&quot; and, worse still, &quot;George Bush Is a Liberal&quot;).    One political operative, whose candidate has been one of Mrs. Loeb's most aggressive suitors, says: &quot;The secret of this whole thing is not to be trashed -- and not to be caught in a bear hug.&quot;    Mrs. Loeb knows that mainstream journalists, along with most political candidates, regard her newspaper -- the largest in the state, with a daily circulation of 70,000 and a Sunday circulation of 86,000 -- as quirky, something of a broadsheet version of the Paul Harvey radio show.    &quot;I read it when I'm looking for an otherworldly experience, a visit to a galaxy far, far away and long, long ago,&quot; says Martin Nolan, who edits the liberal-minded editorial page of the Boston Globe. &quot;You have to look at it in small doses. To do it every day requires a willing suspension of disbelief.&quot;    By all accounts, Mrs. Loeb, who lives in nearby Goffstown, is more involved in the paper than her late husband was. She labors in an office just off the newsroom, and &quot;she's kept the bite in the newspaper,&quot; says GOP Gov. John Sununu. Under her leadership, the paper is better organized and the coverage has been expanded.    With the Boston Globe increasing its New Hampshire staff and publishing a special state supplement on Sundays and with cable and satellites extending the reach of television into faraway mountain villages, the impact of &quot;the paper&quot; -- almost everybody in political circles here refers to it that way -- may be reduced in 1988. But the Republican candidates still appear at her office, one by one, &quot;moving toward it,&quot; in the words of Richard Winters, a Dartmouth College political scientist, &quot;like a moth toward the light.&quot;    Even George Bush, whom Mr. Loeb described as a &quot;loser&quot; and a &quot;spoon-fed little rich kid,&quot; spoke at a dinner last March honoring the late publisher as a crusader for the conservative principles that &quot;bring all of us here tonight.&quot;    &quot;There are a lot of people who tell me how fond they were of what Bill wrote,&quot; says Mrs. Loeb. &quot;You can see through a lot of it, but the paper is important enough for them to make the trip.&quot;    One way or the other, the Union Leader almost always injects itself into the primary.    In 1972, Democratic Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine, responding to a barrage of criticism from the paper, mounted a flatbed truck in front of the Union Leader office, defended his wife against criticism and said of Mr. Loeb: &quot;This man doesn't walk, he crawls.&quot; Whether Mr. Muskie actually cried that day or whether the snow only made it seem that way has been a subject for anguished debate ever since, but Mr. Loeb's response to the Muskie attack was unambiguous. &quot;If ever a man stood convicted of telling a baldfaced lie,&quot; Mr. Loeb wrote in all capital letters, his trademark, &quot;that man is Senator Muskie!&quot;    Four years later, when President Ford made a pre-primary visit to the state, Mr. Loeb, an early Ronald Reagan supporter, wrote, again in all capital letters: &quot;To put it bluntly and perhaps a bit harshly, but we think accurately, Jerry is a jerk and we can't stand any more jerks in the White House if we are to survive as a free nation.&quot;    Mr. Loeb's editorials were dictated over the telephone, giving them a conversational air, but Mrs. Loeb, confined to a wheelchair after an automobile accident a decade ago, is somewhat less explosive. &quot;She doesn't use language as strong or as biting as her husband,&quot; says Charles Douglas, a former state Supreme Court justice and New Hampshire chairman for the Kemp campaign. &quot;But she is simple and direct. She doesn't write for members of the Harvard Club.&quot;    So hardly anyone was surprised when she urged New Hampshire voters to &quot;take ae close look at George Bush and decide whether we want the wimp of yesteryear to be the president of the future.&quot;    Now she is looking over the Republican field and isn't too enthralled with what she sees.    Mr. Haig &quot;had so much past that I don't think he's in our future.&quot; Mr. Dole is &quot;wishy-washy.&quot; The Rev. Pat Robertson has good ideas, &quot;but I don't think we're ready for him.&quot; There's &quot;something about&quot; Rep. Kemp &quot;that makes it impossible for people to understand what he is saying,&quot; and when a fellow GOP candidate told her Mr. Kemp reminded him of the Strategic Defense Initiative -- about 60% effective -- she asked whether she could borrow the line.    For a long time the smart money was on Mr. Laxalt, though Mrs. Loeb worried that he was &quot;running as a past president&quot; -- more as a Reaganite than as his own man. The one who has been getting the strongest praise lately is Mr. du Pont, whom she described in a recent editorial as &quot;a genuine conservative, with a genuine faith in Ronald Reagan's principles.&quot;    Yet some sharp observers believe that the infatuation with Mr. du Pont is only a diversionary tactic designed to highlight the faults of Mr. Bush.    &quot;This looks like the good preppie/bad preppie routine,&quot; says former New Hampshire Attorney General Thomas Rath, a top Dole aide. &quot;She's saying there's a guy with horn-rimmed glasses and starched shirts and silk ties but he's the good preppie. Bush is the bad preppie.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
