 First came Samna with Ami, then Ami Professional, and now there'sMicrosoft with Word for Windows.andP;  It's arguable that Microsoft should havebeen the first to enter the fray, but tardiness doesn't matter now.andP;  Whatmatters is that Word for Window is a better product than anyone expected itwould be.andM;Changing word processors is not something most people readily do, and a shiftfrom DOS to a graphical environment like Windows can make that move even lessattractive.andP;  But Word for Windows is so powerful, and its new tools souseful, that it may change the way you think about word processing, includingwhat you think a word processing program is and what a document ought to be,look like, and do.andM;Word for Windows is, first of all, a yeomanlike word processor that willstand tall with the best of the breed.andP;  Whatever your business or personalword processing needs, Word for Windows will accommodate them well.andP;  Thatgoes for everything from writing an ordinary letter or report to publishing anewsletter that has multiple, ruled columns and embedded graphics; it alsoincludes using data hotlinked from other Windows applications.andM;If you're a seasoned word processing user, you won't have much troublegetting used to Word for Windows.andP;  Most of the things you need to do --cutting, pasting, deleting, and moving text -- will come easily and naturallyenough, although if you're not used to Windows and its mouse-clicking,pulled-down menu ways, you will need to do a little bit of learning.andM;Word for Windows provides two optional graphics gizmos, called the Ribbon andthe Ruler, that sit atop your screen and provide quick, easy access tocharacter and paragraph formatting, and that make creating styles almosttrivial.andP;  Just click on the designated buttons of the Ribbon to format textfor bold or italic, change front or type size, add sub- or superscripts,underline text, or just about anything else.andM;Similarly, clicking on Ruler buttons lets you move paragraph indents andmargins, tune up line spacing, set tabs, or even change intercolumn spacingin a multiple-column document.andP;  If you feel uncertain, just click on any openarea of the Ribbon or Ruler and you'll be presented with the standard Wordfor Windows format dialog boxes, where every facet of the selection's formatis presented and can be changed.andM;To create a style, just format your paragraph and characters to look the wayyou want, and then click on the style button in the Ruler.andP;  When the styleselection box drops down, type in a new style name and, just like that,you've defined a new style.andP;  If you're modifying an old style, just click onits name, confirm the change, and it's done.andP;  Similarly, to apply a style totext, click on the button, click on the style name you want, and that's that.andM;You can edit headers and footers in page view or in a separate panel thatincludes yet another graphics gizmo that makes it easy to insert date, time,and page number fields.andP;  You can also insert other fields, such as authorname and document title, page count, and word count, anywhere in yourdocument.andM;Word for Window's tables are handy ways to organize sections of your documentinto rows and columns.andP;  You can use them for straight text tables orfornumeric tables in which mathematical relationships can be defined.andP;  Ifthis minispreadsheet capability isn't enough, you can either hotlink yourdocument via DDE to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or warmlink it to Lotus1-2-3.andP;  You can also insert any graphic saved in TIFF format, includingtables, into any part of your document.andM;Word for Windows offers formatting capabilities that are nearly as flexibleas any you'll find in a desktop publishing package; the program is equallyflexible in displaying the results.andP;  Views include everything from draftmode, which is ugly but fast, to page preview mode.andP;  You can edit textboundaries and graphics position in page preview mode, or you can go back tosomething in between, like page view mode, where you can edit everything onthe WYSIWYG screen.andM;Electronics spellers and thesauri have been around for a while, and thoughthey're all useful, none are perfect.andP;  Word for Windows is no exception here,but Microsoft's implementation of the Houghton Mifflin thesaurus is justabout the best thing around.andP;  it provides synonyms with definitions, and itlets you explore each synonym's meaning for more words to think about.andM;The program's outline processor is so much fun to use that it could makebelievers out of writers who never use outlines.andP;  The outline processor comeswith its own graphics gadget, called the Outline Icon Bar, that appears whenyou shift into outline view.andP;  Headings are demoted or promoted, collapsed orexpanded, moved, or even transformed into text as you click on theappropriate buttons.andP;  You can use the traditional outlining keys found in theDOS version of Word and other outline processors, but using the bar is somuch faster that you'll soon forget which keystrokes do what.andM;Style sheets and glossaries, long familiar to DOS Word users, have beenreplaced by Document templates in Word for Windows.andP;  These include styles,glossary entries, predefined document text, and macros.andP;  Templates set theenvironment for each document, and they can even direct the author in how tocreate and format a new document.andM;You can use the macro capability to customize the program to meet your ownneeds or your company's standards.andP;  You can shift menu items from one menu tothe next, delete them altogether, modify their text, or even change theirmeaning.andP;  You can also make Ctrl or Alt keystrokes whatever you want them tobe.andM;Standard Word for Windows menu items are on an equal footing withuser-created macros.andP;  Your macros can be run from menus or keystrokes or cantake off automatically when a new document is created, when an old one isopened, or when Word for Windows, is started.andP;  The macro language, whichlooks like a cross between C and BASIC, will seem quite familiar to MicrosoftExcel users.andM;Templates can include glossary items, such as boilerplate text, that can bemanually inserted, along with predefined Word for Windows fields, into textat any point.andP;  Macros can also insert text automatically or interactively.andO;You can specify that boilerplate text be inserted into a document attached toa particular template whenever you open the document.andM;For managing large projects involving many authors or editors, Word forWindows includes such helpful tools as a revision-mark facility and a filecomparison command that uses the revision-mark protocols to let you knowwhere changes have been made in the latest version of your document.andM;Editors or readers can insert comments into annotations rather than intonormal text.andP;  The annotations are hidden unless you choose to view them.andP;  Youcan lock your document so that only annotations can be inserted, deleted, orchanged.andM;If these features don't satisfy your project management needs, the programalso offers Goto and Macro buttons.andP;  The former will take you to a specifiedpoint in your document, and the latter will execute a macro or any Word forWindows command.andM;The Word for Windows help system is comprehensive, including hints for peoplefamiliar with the DOS version of the program and for those versed inDisplayWrite 4, MultiMate, Wang systems, WordPerfect, and WordStar.andP;  Ifthat's not enough, the &quot;Getting Right to Word&quot; handbook delivered with theproduct is full of tips for users of those products.andP;  Other documentationincludes a comprehensive, alphabetically organized reference manual, adocument and template sampler, and a pocket guide that's very useful, albeithardly pocket-sized.andP;  In addition, Word for Windows includes import andexport filters that let your documents peacefully coexist with those createdwith these other products.andM;No aspect of Word for Windows is flawless.andP;  Like any first-generationproduct, the program has imperfections and shortcomings.andP;  The worst defectsturn out to be inherent to Windows, however.andP;  The most important of theseinvolves the program's handling of screen fonts.andP;  Although Word for Windows'programmers have improved on what's available directly from Windows, thefonts are far from perfect, resulting in a WYSINQWYG(what-you-see-is-not-quite-what-you-get) screen rather than a WYSIWYG one.andO;It's a far cry from character-mode word processing, but a crying shame nextto Macintosh-based word processing.andM;Will you be happy with Word for Windows?andP;  If all you ever do is write memosin 12-point Courier, probably not; the program will be overkill for what youdo.andP;  But if you want to enter into a new generation of word processing andinformation management technology, take Word for Windows seriously.andP;  Youmight become the happiest word processing user on the block.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
