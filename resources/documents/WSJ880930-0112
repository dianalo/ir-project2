Ross Perot scored an important legal victory in the dispute over his Postal Service contract, but his problems stemming from the contract appear far from over.    A federal appeals court freed the Postal Service and Mr. Perot's Perot Systems Corp. to resume work under the contract. The General Services Administration, which adjudicates protests over contracts by most federal agencies, had blocked the Perot agreement, but the court ruled that the GSA doesn't have jurisdiction over Postal Service contracts.    Mr. Perot's potential gain from the contract -- originally estimated to be in the millions -- appears muddied by other factors, however.    The latest obstacle, and possibly the biggest Mr. Perot faces, is the suit filed Tuesday by General Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems Corp. charging that Mr. Perot has violated an agreement he signed when he left GM in 1986. Mr. Perot, who founded EDS 26 years ago and sold it to GM in 1984, agreed when he left the company not to compete for business with EDS for three years.    The dispute over the Postal Service contract began when EDS claimed that the no-bid award of the contract to Perot Systems was against government policies of competitive bidding. EDS also accused Mr. Perot of violating his parting terms by undertaking the Postal Service contract.    If the EDS lawsuit is successful, Mr. Perot's Postal Service contract would be threatened. The Fairfax County, Va., court handling the EDS suit said it will hear a motion for a preliminary injunction restraining Mr. Perot Oct. 13.    Meanwhile, J. Patrick Horner, president of Perot Systems, said the company was ready to resume work on the contract. &quot;We'll go back tomorrow, our team is ready to reassemble,&quot; he said.    The first part of the contract, a 90-day study, has a budget of as much as $500,000. The second part, which involves work on the cost-cutting measures proposed by the study, was potentially more lucrative.    In the original contract, Perot Systems would have been the contractor carrying out the measures for more than 10 years. The Postal Service also had agreed that it wouldn't hire anyone else to work on the measures for the first five years unless Perot Systems approved.    However, following protests by other companies as well as pressure from Congress, the generosity of the contract toward Mr. Perot has been scaled down considerably.    According to Perot Systems, a new contract has already been negotiated. The Postal Service, however, said it hasn't decided on its next step.    Perot Systems says it now will complete the first part of the contract, but will only oversee the cost-cutting measures. Work on cost-cutting measures will be granted on an open-bid basis.    EDS, meanwhile, dismissed yesterday's court decision as &quot;merely a jurisdictional decision, and not one made on the merits of the contract.&quot; The company said it will look to Congress to solve the dispute.    Congress has been critical of the Postal Service's decision to award a no-bid contract and has pressured Postmaster General Anthony Frank to &quot;modify&quot; the terms of the pact. </TEXT></DOC>
