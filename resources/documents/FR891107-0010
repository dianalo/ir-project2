The proposalwas prompted by service difficulty reports (39 since 1983) of scavengepump gear failures on certain TCM engines, models TSIO-520B, BB, D, DB,E, EB, J, JB, K, KB, N, NB, UB and VB. Failure of the scavenge pump gearsresults in total loss of engine power due to lack of lubrication. Thisproblem is addressed in TCM SB M89-4 which recommends a one-time inspectionof marked gears and replacement of any unmarked gear or any marked gearwhich fails the inspection. The gears, part numbers (P/N's) 635334 and639388, have a shallow hardness depth, and wear or pressure abrasive cleaningprocedures can destroy the hardened layer. TCM introduced carburized gears,P/N's 649157 and 649159, which have much greater resistance to wear. However,they did not mark the early production gears by drill point as is currentlybeing done. Therefore, there are unidentifiable carburized gears in use.These carburized gears (P/N's 649157 and 649159) are to replace P/N's 635334and 639388 and unmarked gears P/N's 649157 and 649159.Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate inthe making of this amendment. No comments were received.Accordingly, the proposal is adopted without change.The regulations adopted herein do not have substantial direct effects onthe States, on the relationship between the national government and theStates, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among thevarious levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order12612, it is determined that this final rule will not have sufficient federalismimplications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation involves 8,481 engines andwill cost approximately $310 per engine for a total cost of $2,629,110.Therefore, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``major rule'' underExecutive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); (3) does notwarrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impactis so minimal; and (4) will not have a significant economic impact, positiveor negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Engines, Air transportation, Aircraft, and Aviation safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) amends part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations (FAR) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="62">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

The scavenge pump gears, P/N 649157 and P/N 649159that are marked with a drill point should be inspected as follows: SeeFigure 1. <G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus. 282</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/>Prior to inspection, the scavenge oil pump gears should be cleaned withan approved carbon cleaner and thoroughly rinsed with a mineral spiritsolvent. After proper cleaning has been accomplished, the gears shouldbe inspected using the dimensions specified in the Table of Limits andthe Magnaflux procedures covered in the TSIO520 Permold Series OverhaulManual X30574A. If the gears are found to be within serviceable limits,they should further be visually inspected for uneven wear, pitting or excessivegalling. If these indications are revealed, the gears should be replaced.A light amount of polishing is normal and to be expected.CAUTION . . . Do not pressure abrasive blast gears. This may remove surfacehardness thus causing excessive gear wear.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-26169 Filed 11-6-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4910-13-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
