Northwest officials expressed immediate skepticism that theunion will carry out its threat, but said the airline hasmanagement workers and replacement attendants in training to keepthe airline operating if it does.   ``The Teamsters have set many deadlines ... and flightattendants continue to work,'' said Bob Gibbons, a Northwestspokesman. ``We'll just have to see if this deadline has any morevalidity than others the union has announced.''   Genoese met several hours at Teamster headquarters here with GuyCook, president of the Machinists Union's District 143 inMinneapolis, which represents Northwest's 20,000 mechanics andbaggage handlers.   ``I have no doubt that the membership I represent will honor anywork stoppage,'' said Cook ``We've got our own problems innegotiations with Northwest. If they want a war, they probably aregoing to get one.''   The Teamsters earlier had threatened to strike Northwest thelast weekend of February, when a 30-day cooling-off period orderedby the National Mediation Board expired.   Northwest, based in St. Paul, Minn., has announced it willunilaterally impose a new policy manual on April 1 replacing theold flight attendants' contract and stretching out from five yearsto eight years the time required for a newly hired attendant toreach top scale.   Absent from Monday's meeting were representatives of the AirLine Pilots Association, which represents 2,300 Northwest pilots.   ``The pilots have told us that when the time comes, they will dothe right thing,'' Genoese said.   Leaders of ALPA's Northwest locals could not be reached forcomment. But John Mazor, a spokeman at the pilot union'sheadquarters here, said its policy is to ``not announce anydecision on whether to support a strike by another union unless oruntil a strike occurs and a picket line goes up.''   Under the National Railway Labor Act governing labor relationsin the rail and airline industries, courts have frequently orderedmembers of unions not on strike themselves but honoring anotherunion's picket line to return to work.   Terms of a two-tier, A and B, wage system at Northwest underwhich new hires reach the pay level of veterans have been the majorstumbling block in the bargaining talks between the airline and theTeamsters.   The union originally proposed eliminating the lower B scaleentirely but had agreed to stretch it to six years before the talksbroke off.   Northwest's last contract proposal included raising base pay forbeginning flight attendants on the B scale would climb from $13,000to $15,000 over a five-year period. Base pay for full-time veteranson the top A scale would rise from $32,000 to $35,000 under thesame offer.</TEXT></DOC>
