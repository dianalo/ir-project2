With the blessing of the Defense Department, the association isholding its annual meeting this week featuring the customarybig-name speakers such as former Defense Secretary Frank C.Carlucci and information panels on topics like Soviet forces andnational security.   The main attraction, however, is the approximately 200 defenseindustry and Army exhibits on every imaginable aspect of weaponry.   ``The exhibits ... reflect the latest in military doctrine,technological advances and hardware improvements,'' says theassociation, which has held what it touts as ``the largestlandpower forum in the free world'' for the past 35 years.   Among the items on exhibit in the bowels of a Washington hotelwere a full-scale light armored vehicle, a handful of howitzers andseveral high-tech videos promoting helicopters, M-16 machine gunsand night-vision goggles.   Beribboned officers, fresh-faced cadets and defense industryofficials created traffic jams as they grabbed glossy brochures,closely examined the rifles and handguns and questioned thehundreds of company representatives.   Some sat transfixed as they watched a sophisticated video on theLHX helicopter displayed on 16 television monitors. It was acombination of James Bond and Top Gun.   ``Time to smell the coffee, sucker,'' said the helicopter pilotas he maneuvered his aircraft through mountain ranges and greenvalleys and located his target with the help of a British-soundingfemale voice.   ``Have a nice walk home, Ivan,'' the pilot said after asuccessful hit.   But beyond all the glitz, there was serious business asofficials from General Motors, McDonnell Douglas, General Electric,ITT Defense and John Deere briefed representatives from foreigncountries and the United States on their latest wares.   For the buyer who can't afford to fly from one company to thenext, the meeting provides a ``great place for networking in amarketing environment,'' said Joe O'Brien, an official with GeneralMotors, as he stood in front of the company's 14 1@2-ton lightarmored vehicle equipped with a 25mm gun.   The meeting, according to O'Brien, is strictly for the buyer whowants to browse.   ``No contracts. We don't even talk about contracts. If we didthe defense secretary could not endorse it,'' he said. ``Thosetypes of things are verboten.''   Instead, the companies tout the advantages and successes oftheir products with the hope that a telephone call or meeting at alater date will result in a sale.   General Motors' light armored vehicle is ideal for low-intensityconflicts and in fact, 14 of them were flown into Panama when therebel forces led a failed coup against leader Manuel AntonioNoriega, according to the General Motors official.   The vehicle has ``great acceleration, a low silhouette, whenit's smaller it's harder to hit, great mobility,'' O'Brien said.   Like in a car showroom where prospective buyers kick the tires,people have come up and knocked their knuckles on the vehicle andsaid, ``Oh boy, this is it,'' he said.   On the other side of the room, in front of a large video screen,representatives of Bell Helicopter Textron praised the V-22 Osprey,the aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but flies like aplane.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in his budget for the fiscal yearthat began Oct. 1, proposed killing the program. The move was metwith opposition on Capitol Hill where the Marine Corps aircraftenjoys a great deal of popularity.   House and Senate conferees hammering out a final defense billhave not yet reached a decision on the aircraft. But Dick Spivey ofBell Helicopter Textron is convinced the Osprey is key to thenation's defense.   ``Noriega may be here in jail now if we had the V-22,'' thecompany official said.</TEXT></DOC>
