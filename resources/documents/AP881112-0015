In the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops shot and wounded threePalestinians during protests Friday, hospital officials said. Twoboys aged 12 and 15 were wounded in an Arab neighborhood ofJerusalem in shootings that were under investigation, Israeltelevision said.   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile, isexpected to declare an independent Palestinian state in the WestBank and Gaza Strip during its four-day meeting beginning today inAlgiers, Algeria.   All Gaza residents were placed under curfew as of 9 p.m. Friday,including at least 250,000 who were confined to small concrete-blockhomes in refugee camps.   Troops standing guard at entry points to Jerusalem turned awayArab cars from the West Bank, the military spokesman said.   Earlier Friday, troops rounded up and detained hundreds ofPalestinians in an effort to prevent rioting during the councilmeeting. Israeli television said authorities cut phone links withmany West Bank areas to further isolate them and prevent organizedactivities.   Soldiers streamed into Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods, doublingthe standing police and Border Patrol forces to 1,100 men. PoliceMinister Chaim Bar-Lev said further steps would be taken as needed.   ``If necessary, we will seal or clamp curfews on neighborhoods onthe periphery of Jerusalem,'' he said on Israeli television, usingthe Arabic news program to reach Arab viewers.   ``Saturday, Sunday and Monday will be days of escalation,'' saidleaflet No. 28 of the Palestinian leadership. ``All the strikeforces ... should escalate protest and resistance against the forcesof occupation, wherever they are in the territories.''   The leaders called for a complete strike Tuesday, at the end ofthe Palestine Council session.   The Palestinian uprising in the territories has lasted nearly ayear and cost the lives of at least 310 Palestinians and 11Israelis. About 1.5 million Palestinians live in the territoriesIsrael seized from Jordan and Egypt during the 1967 Middle East war.   The commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank, Maj. Gen. AmramMitzna, also used Israeli television's Arabic news to appeal toPalestinians to ignore calls for protests.   ``No decision from the outside ... will bring change _ it willonly make things worse,'' Mitzna said, referring to the anticipateddeclaration of independence. ``I am appealing to residents ... toavoid clashes with the security forces.''   In the Gaza Strip Friday, troops shot and wounded three Arab menduring clashes in refugee camps, hospital officials said.   The camps were under curfew most of the day but clashes broke outin Jabalia camp during a temporary lifting of the restrictions,designed to let residents shop for food, an Arab reporter said.   Youths took to the streets to protest and hurl stones atsoldiers, the reporter said.   A 20-year-old was shot in the left foot and a 25-year-old wasshot in the back, hospital officials said.   In the Nusseirat camp, also in Gaza, a 27-year-old man was shotin the leg when he violated the curfew and left his home, a hospitalofficial said.   Israel television said police were investigating whether the twoJerusalem boys were shot by a civilian who fired live ammunition atstone-throwers who attacked his car.</TEXT></DOC>
