Gen. Henri Namphy mutinied against more commanders Wednesdayand civilians rallied to join the uprising. Witnesses said a12-year-old boy was killed when troops fired on a crowd.   Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, made president Sunday after a coup ledby Namphy's Presidential Guard, tried to quell the militaryuprising Tuesday by naming a new armed forces chief and retiringnine unpopular commanding officers.   ``The situation is precarious. After all, we are in the midst ofa general mutiny,'' a Western diplomat said Wednesday.   Coup leaders who put Avril in power demanded that he institutedemocratic reforms, including free elections that Haiti has not hadin 31 years. But even though Avril appealed for calm, the purgethat put him in power continued to spread to military barracks andthe streets.   Radio Haiti Inter said army units opposed to Avril attacked acrowd in this capital city at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday and that a12-year-old boy, identified as Nilo Chailes, was killed and threepeople were wounded.   Witnesses said the crowd was on its way to pillage the home of asergeant known for his brutality when soldiers fired.   The station said mutineers battled other soldiers, with onesoldier killed in a clash Tuesday in Jacmel, about 45 miles southof Port-au-Prince.   Mutineers on Wednesday were rounding up agents of Namphy'sBureau of Criminal Investigatons and leaving them at armyheadquarters in Port-au-Prince. before cheering crowds, Radio HaitiInter reported.   Radio stations said ousted military commanders were also beingdropped off _some in handcuffs _ at the headquarters, but theirfate was unclear.   Radio Soleil, the Roman Catholic radio station, reportedWednesday that Sergo Joseph, arrested Aug. 5 for writing ananti-government slogan on a wall, was freed by a judge Tuesdaynight.   He was severely beaten after his arrest and the human rightsgroup Amnesty International campaigned for his release.   In Cap Haitien, a crowd plundered the residence of Louis Noisin,a former Senate president, Radio Haiti Inter reported.   On Tuesday, civilians supporting the mutineers engaged in mobkillings and workers at government companies struck to unseatstate-appointed managers, actions apparently aimed at wiping outremnants of Namphy's rule.   ``The demands of the mutineers have been accepted; it has becomea people's army, at least for the moment,'' the diplomat said,speaking on condition of anonymity.   Organizers canceled a demonstration at St. Jean Bosco RomanCatholic Church planned for Wednesday to support the soldiers'rebellion and rescheduled it for Thursday. The organizers, membersof a leftist coalition, said they would meet instead with Avril andSgt. Joseph Heubreux, leader of Saturday's coup.   ``I came to Port-au-Prince from the country to participate inthe demonstration,'' said Andre-Juste Pierre, 32, an unemployedwelder from Cabaret, 20 miles north of the capital. ``I don't feelfrustrated because the military government is afraid. We'lldemonstrate tomorrow.''   About 100 people gathered in front of the burned-out ruins ofthe church, staring at the charred, mutilated body of a thug killedby a mob Tuesday.   Witnesses identified him as an ex-officer of the TontonMacoutes, the dreaded private army of the Duvalier dictatorship.They said the man took part in the Sept. 11 massacre of 13parishioners at the church that provoked Saturday's coup.   The government's dismissal of eight generals and a colonelfollowed the ouster by soldiers of at least 11 commandersnationwide since Monday.   In St. Marc, about 60 miles north of the capital, residents tookto the streets Wednesday to punish thugs allegedly allied with thelocal army commander. Soldiers fired rifles into the air todisperse them, Radio Metropole reported.   Among officers retired Tuesday was former Defense Minister Brig.Gen. Williams Regala, despised in Haiti for his ties to thedictatorship of Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier and his son,Jean-Claude. Namphy headed a three-man junta that ruled Haiti afterthe younger Duvalier was forced into exile on Feb. 7, 1986.   Central Bank employees went on strike Wednesday demanding theboard of directors resign, Radio Metropole said.   Employees of at least the state flour mill and electric companyjoined the military mutiny and ousted their bosses Tuesday.Unpopular managers of other government companies also wereexpelled, radio stations said, but details were sketchy.   Radio stations estimated that up to 12 Tonton Macoutes had beenkilled by mobs and soldiers since Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
