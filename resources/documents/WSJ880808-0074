Charles McVey was ordered returned on charges of wire fraud and attempting to defraud a computer company.    Justice Alan MacDonell of the British Columbia Supreme Court ruled that enough evidence was presented against the former Orange County, Calif., man to suggest that a jury could find him guilty of the charges in Canada, one of the conditions for extradition.    Mr. McVey, 63 years old, was arrested in a Yukon fishing village last year, and Cpl. Danny Fudge, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer who captured him, was invited to Washington to receive a special award.    Mr. McVey won an earlier extradition case June 20 when the British Columbia Supreme Court turned down a U.S. request for his return on smuggling charges. Crown prosecutors have appealed that judgment. There was no immediate word from Mr. McVey or his lawyers on whether he will appeal Friday's ruling to the British Columbia Court of Appeal.    The fraud charges were outlined during a three-week extradition hearing that concluded July 20.    Mr. McVey is under indictment in California on eight counts of wire fraud, and for allegedly devising and participating in a scheme to defraud Saxpy Computer Corp., Sunnyvale, Calif., of proprietary rights to the Saxpy Matrix-I Super Computer.    Mr. McVey's attorney, Robert Anderson, said the charges referred only to a &quot;scheme&quot; and that was &quot;not one of the listed crimes&quot; in the Canada-U.S. Extradition Treaty. But prosecutors argued successfully that the crime was the equivalent of fraud in Canada. </TEXT></DOC>
