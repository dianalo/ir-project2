Joseph Biden announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.    In a speech here in his hometown and in later appearances in Washington and Des Moines, Iowa, Mr. Biden crafted an appeal to the Baby Boom generation to &quot;reclaim its special legacy and redeem the promise of America for ourselves and our children.&quot;    The three-term senator -- at age 44 slightly older than the Baby Boomers -- portrayed the New Frontier of the 1980s as the task of reviving the economy and the national spirit, and criticized the &quot;protectionism&quot; of some of his Democratic rivals as &quot;defeatism.&quot; He signaled plans to make the welfare of children and the integrity of government touchstones in his campaign.    &quot;In the spirit of another time,&quot; Mr. Biden said, summoning memories of President Kennedy's inaugural address, &quot;let us pledge that our generation of Americans will pay any price, bear any burden, accept any challenge, meet any hardship to secure the blessings of prosperity and the promise of America for our children.&quot;    Sen. Biden sought to establish himself as a moral force that would attract younger voters and infuse Americans with a sense of selflessness. &quot;In 1988, the clarion call for my generation is not 'It's our turn,'&quot; he said, &quot;but rather 'It's our moment of obligation and opportunity.'&quot;    He launched his campaign with a hometown rally that emphasized his commitment to family -- his first wife and daughter were killed in an automobile crash shortly after he was elected to the Senate in 1972, and he has commuted to Washington by train ever since -- and the intimacy of politics in this tiny state. A high-school band, its gold and green standards hanging listlessly in the heavy June air, played &quot;It's a Small World After All.&quot;    As in his first Senate race, when the young, unknown New Castle County councilman upended two-term Republican Sen. Caleb Boggs despite the Nixon landslide, Mr. Biden begins his presidential campaign as an underdog. Despite months of travel and perhaps the best speaking style of any Democratic presidential hopeful, Mr. Biden has failed to generate much movement in the polls, and a recent survey of past Iowa caucus attenders showed him with the support of only 1% in that state, site of the first 1988 political test.    But Mr. Biden, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has assembled an experienced political staff, raised more than $2 million -- more than any other Democratic aspirant -- and hopes to fill the vacuum left by the withdrawal of former Sen. Gary Hart, who also fashioned a strong generational appeal.    His speech here yesterday was designed in large measure to set him apart from the other Democratic contenders, particularly Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, whose support of a strong trade-retaliation amendment in the House helped him emerge from the Democratic pack.    &quot;We cannot accept the naivete of free traders who ignore the flagrant abuses of our trading partners, nor can we accept the morally bankrupt, easy answer of protectionism -- an answer that smacks of defeatism,&quot; Mr. Biden said.    The theme of his first campaign day was what he called &quot;America at risk,&quot; and Mr. Biden sketched a nation that was jeopardizing its children, its economy, its environment and its spirit. He suggested that some workers don't work hard enough and that some managers don't manage well enough. &quot;In Ronald Reagan's America,&quot; he said, &quot;we have honored not the valiant but the victors, not the worthy but the winners.&quot;    Throughout the day he invoked the 1960s calls for challenge and commitment, arguing that &quot;this generation of Americans has the opportunity so rarely granted to others by fate and history.&quot;    The candidate repeatedly steered a middle path -- between protectionism and free trade, between profligate government spending and austerity, between President Reagan and the liberals of his own party.    &quot;We cannot succumb to the isolationist instinct of those who would put up trade walls to keep out the world, or others who would pull a Star Wars cover over our heads -- a Maginot Line that is ravaging our economic capital, nuclearizing the heavens and yielding the fate of our children's world to the malfunction of a computer,&quot; he said.    Sen. Biden said he hoped his campaign would mobilize the politically discontent -- the &quot;untapped legions, whose success in other fields prepares them by disposition, experience, confidence and creativity to transfuse the tired blood of our politics with new ideas, new approaches and new energy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
