Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov told reporters heexpected a meeting of the 15-member council by Wednesday. He saidthe Soviets will introduce a resolution demanding an end to thedevastating missile bombardment of both capitals.   Moscow, however, has been reluctant to push for a punitive armsembargo against Iran for delay in complying with a cease-fire asdemanded by the council last July 20. The Soviets have beenimproving relations with Tehran.   Belonogov said his government favors more time for diplomacybefore imposing a weapons ban against Iran or Iraq.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman onMonday urged the council to act quickly on an arms embargoresolution.   Iran meanwhile demanded that the council condemn Iraq forstarting the deadly war of the cities now in its second week.   Both sides claim the strikes on Tehran and Baghdad are defensiveand retaliatory. Both are believed to be using Soviet-made missilesin the missile attacks, the most intense in the 7{-year-old war.   As the council met behind closed doors to discuss the missilestrikes, Iran's attempt to stave off an embargo with an ambiguousnote to the council appeared to have failed.   The ``undated, unsigned scrap of paper'' does not ``constitute aclear acceptance'' of Security Council Resolution 598, BritishAmbassador Sir Crispin Tickell said Monday. ``If they accept, theyshould say so _ loudly, clearly and unequivocally.''   Redman said the United States sees nothing new in the``non-paper'' and ``very much doubts that anyone else does either.''   He told reporters that in pursuing the arms embargo, ``We arecontinuing active consultations with other council members toachieve consensus on this resolution, which we are convinced wouldhelp bring the gulf war to an end.'' The unsigned note handed byIran's U.N. envoy to the Security Council president last weekclaims a Feb. 28 letter from Iranian Foreign Minister Ali AlbarVelayati constituted acceptance of the council's cease-fireresolution.   The letter, however, did not say Iran endorsed the resolution.   ``We also note that several Iranian spokesmen have issuedstatements over the past few days disavowing the non-paper releasedin New York,'' Redman noted.   The agreement of all five permanent council members _ the UnitedStates, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ is needed topass an arms embargo resolution. Each has a veto. Washington hassaid the stumbling block is the Soviet Union.   Redman said Secretary of State George Shultz would probablyraise the issue in talks with Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian of Chinathis week.   The Soviets are close allies of Iraq but have also been tryingto improve relations with neighboring Iran.   Crowds in Tehran, angered at being the target of Soviet-mademissiles, tried to storm the Soviet Embassy over the weekend.Belonogov denied that ``the defensive weapons now used againstTehran and other cities'' are Soviet-made.   He also urged Iran and Iraq to stop the attacks and describedthe escalation in the war of the cities as a major development inthe gulf conflict.   ``We consider this as just not another espisode in the war ...We think that the war between cities adds some new dimension to theprotracted military conflict between the two neighboringcountries,'' he said.   Belonogov said he met Monday with Secretary-General Javier Perezde Cuellar and with the president of the Security Council thismonth, Yugoslav Ambassador Dragoslav Pejic, and urged them ``in themost energetic terms'' to try to persuade Iran and Iraq to stop themissile attacks.   ``The position of my country is clear. We are for the soonestpossible political resolution of the war conflict between Iran andIraq and for the speediest possible implementation of the SecurityCouncil Resolution 598.''</TEXT></DOC>
