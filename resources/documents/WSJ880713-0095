Inside, a song with mournful lyrics fills the gray-walled building. &quot;Mother, mother, why can't Daddy kiss me?&quot; asks the singer, a child whose father has been killed at the Iraqi front.    At times during Iran's eight-year-old war with Iraq, thousands of youngsters have mobbed this building, eager to volunteer for combat. But this week, despite government calls for increased recruitment in response to America's downing of the Iranian jetliner, the center is quiet.    &quot;People are busy with school exams,&quot; explains Mohamed Mohammedi, the center's personnel director. &quot;If you come back in two weeks you'll see many more people here.&quot;    But outside the center, a 19-year-old student also named Mohamed offers a different explanation. &quot;We are all afraid, especially of the chemical weapons,&quot; he says. &quot;My friends and I talk about nothing but how to avoid going to the war.&quot;    In today's Iran, the fading of revolutionary fervor is everywhere apparent -- not just in Republic Square. With a sick economy, a dying leader and an increasingly unpopular war, Iran no longer looks like a nation of inspired fanatics bent on conquering the world with its austere brand of Islam. Instead, the gulf war has left once-strident Iran psychologically exhausted and financially impoverished. At least for the moment, Iranians have become more outspoken in their criticism of national policy and the economic realities it has reaped.    On the streets of Tehran, women now boldly flout the dress code of the revolution: the wearing of the chador, the tentlike black robe. While many Iranians still are shrouded head-to-toe in the chador, many others are wearing fashionable wideshouldered jackets that fall to just below the knee. Underneath are tight blue jeans or fancy black lace stockings, while bright scarves are tossed over the head and plenty of hair is left visible.    A few months ago, street patrols of Revolutionary Guards would have reprimanded or punished women for dressing so daringly. But &quot;the government knows it can't push people right now,&quot; says a Western businessman who has lived in Iran for 10 years. &quot;People have to put up with the war and the rotten economy. They certainly aren't going to put up with harassment from Revolutionary Guards as well.&quot;    Even some of the revolution's most ardent supporters acknowledge these new limits. Saharnouz Davalou demonstrated against the shah in the angry protests of the late 1970s, and at 27 years old she is still very much a revolutionary. Wearing a chador and carrying a walkie-talkie, she helps control the crowd of worshippers at Tehran University's Friday prayers.    She concedes that this isn't the job it once was, when every street around the campus had to be closed to accommodate the overflowing throng. But &quot;if people don't come,&quot; she says, &quot;it doesn't mean they don't agree with the government. Maybe some don't agree, but you also have to realize that we've been almost 10 years now in revolution. People have their work to do, their holidays to enjoy. They don't have to come to every single meeting, every single demonstration.&quot;    Mrs. Davalou, however, happily continues to toe the fundamentalist line. She gave up a teaching job when she married, to conform to her husband's aversion to working wives. Now the family struggles to get by on the $435 a month her husband earns working a part-time job.    &quot;Maybe it's not enough,&quot; she says. &quot;Things are very expensive. But there is a war on and we have to make sacrifices.&quot;    As she speaks, a caravan of Mercedes and BMW cars sweeps from the campus, carrying the government officials who have led the Friday prayers. But despite the flashy cars, the government's coffers aren't much richer than Mrs. Davalou's.    One importer tells of arranging a government purchase of some much-needed industrial equipment. Payment was to be made by a check drawn on the account of the prime minister's office. But when the check was presented at the central bank, it bounced, the importer claims. The prime minister's account just didn't have the funds to cover it.    The symptoms of economic stress in Iran are obvious, from frequent power blackouts to prices that rise almost by the day. One shopper reports that a kilo of yogurt, for example, soared more than 70 cents in the past week. At more than $12 a kilo, this Iranian summer staple has become a luxury.    The government cushions the impact of these prices with a coupon system for lowcost, monthly food rations. But the ration is wildly inadequate, most Iranians say. &quot;You eat for half the month and starve for the other half,&quot; one man grumbles.    Within the government, views appear to be sharply divided on how to deal with these economic problems and the war that is causing them.    With Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini reportedly in the last stages of prostate cancer, an ideological tug of war is being waged over the direction the country should take after his death. Some officials want to continue the war and Iran's international isolation. Others seek a pragmatic solution to the military impasse and acknowledge that international support may be needed to help rebuild Iran's economy.    &quot;Every ministry tells you a different story, every official has a different view,&quot; says a European aid worker who deals frequently with the government.    Despite the turmoil and hardship, Tehran can look like a lively city, especially in the leafy and prosperous northern suburbs. And despite official saber rattling, Iranians are open and friendly to foreigners.    Late at night, laughing families pack kebab restaurants or ride Ferris wheels at a gaudy amusement park. Lines for movies rival the length of New York City's, with one new release, a film titled &quot;Visa,&quot; drawing especially large crowds. The film concerns an Iranian family trying to get out of Iran via Turkey, where visas aren't required and many Iranians go to try to get emigration papers.    &quot;I haven't seen the film, but I can tell you that the ending says you shouldn't leave the country,&quot; explains an English-language teacher, heading to class with a copy of Arthur Miller's &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; under his arm.    American films are also popular, he explains, but only in hard-to-get cassettes, which can be watched discreetly at home. Ironically, &quot;Footloose,&quot; about an American town where teen-agers rebel against a stern preacher's ban on dancing, is one of the hottest films getting passed around.    The teacher takes a visiting foreigner to an English-language bookstore, where titles range from John F. Kennedy's &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; to James Michener's &quot;The Source.&quot; &quot;This shop is still very good -- it used to be great,&quot; the teacher says. For about two years after the revolution, English was scorned and hated, he says, but now it is popular again.    &quot;Even the revolutionaries are interested, because they know it's necessary both to send out the revolutionary message and to bring in the science of the West.&quot;    Iranians don't believe the current openness will necessarily last. Repression and fanaticism still simmer close to the surface of this country.    Just a week ago, when revolutionary guards spotted a male European chatting over the fence with an Iranian woman neighbor, they hauled him and the woman's husband before a committee for a lecture on Islamic standards of moral behavior. &quot;You never feel quite secure,&quot; explains a European factory manager.    Women take off their headscarves when working in his office, he says, but they quickly don them if any visitors arrive. &quot;Just sitting here -- an unrelated man and woman talking together -- could be construed as an offense if a revolutionary guard wanted to make it one,&quot; he says.    At the recruiting center in Republic Square, a 21-year-old named Mosen Seroosh dismisses talk of flagging morale or waning revolutionary fervor.    Mr. Seroosh, the son of a factory worker, was just 15 when he first volunteered to go to the front, and he can't count the number of times he has served there since then. His worst experience was at Halabjah, Iraq, where he says Iraq used chemical weapons.    Mr. Seroosh's battered uniform is streaked with paint. When he isn't needed at the front, he explains, he paints revolutionary banners for the streets of Tehran. Today's slogan: &quot;The fever of war will not cool down while (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein is in power.&quot;    Even though the tide of the war has turned, and though government reports from Iraq now say Iran has been expelled from most of the last major Iraqi lands it occupied, Mr. Seroosh insists he is looking forward to returning to the front.    &quot;I've never been afraid,&quot; he says.&quot;According to our Koran, to die in battle is a gift from God.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
