The official Libyan news agency JANA, monitored in Rome, saidLibya called for an urgent meeting of the OPEC Ministerial Councilto ``take the necessary measures to stop the fall in prices,restore stability to the oil market and to take prices up to levelsthat are fair both to consumer and producer.''   Oil prices tumbled last week to the lowest level since 1986.Most analysts blame the sharp decline on the continued high amountsof Saudi Arabian crude flowing into the market.   The price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,fell Wednesday to $12.60.   JANA said Libya's decision to call for the extraordinary meetingwas made ``after consultation with some (of the 13) OPEC membercountries.'' It did not elaborate.</TEXT></DOC>
