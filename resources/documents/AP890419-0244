On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, had jumped$1.21 a barrel to $22.72 at about 11 a.m. EDT. The contract closedat $21.51 on Tuesday.   ``Details are still vague but there's a possibility that somecompanies aren't able to deliver on cargos due a week from today,''said Ed Ryan, energy broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``Thisis impacting the market in a very big way.''   The explosion and fire on the small oil Cormorant Alpha platformowned by Shell U.K. Exploration and Production on Tuesday shut downthe North Sea Brent oil field, interrupting production of nearly500,000 barrels a day of oil, officials said today.   ``The Cormorant is a gathering station. The Brent crude mustflow through this one smaller station,'' said Bob Baker, oilanalyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Shell officials were expected to examine the damage today anddecide how long the pipelines would remain closed, analysts said.   Energy brokers said the timing of the event, following theAlaskan oil spill, could drive prices significantly higher.   The spill off the Alaskan coast on March 24 closed down oilshipping lanes and disrupted the flow of oil to refineries in theUnited States for several days. Since then, prices of both crudeand refined products have risen by more than 10 cents.   Crude prices have risen nearly 80 percent since last Octoberwhen the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided toreduce oil production.   In addition, problems with other North Sea oil facilities andlower production by the United States have helped push priceshigher.</TEXT></DOC>
