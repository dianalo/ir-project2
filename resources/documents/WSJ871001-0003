Average prices received by farmers last month were 5.7% above their level a year ago.    Higher prices for eggs, milk, wheat and cattle in September were partially offset by lower prices for hogs, broilers and potatoes, the department said.    For the troubled farm sector, the continued climb of cattle prices was one of the bright spots in the department's latest price report. Calf prices, which averaged $86 for each hundred pounds in September, were at their highest level since February 1980, when they reached $90.90.    Prices for all beef cattle averaged $63.60 per hundredweight in September, and steers and heifers averaged $68. Both were the highest levels since August 1980, the department said. Cow prices, at $44.60, were higher than any month since February 1981.    The average price for all hogs dropped $5 in September to $53.60 per hundredweight. Sow prices rose slightly, however.    Food grain prices rose 6.4% from August, while vegetable prices rose 14%. Fruit prices, led by apples and peaches, rose 2.8% from August. Potato prices fell to $4.27 per hundredweight from $5.10, according to the department. </TEXT></DOC>
