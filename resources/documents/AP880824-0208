(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge rejected theproposed PTL reorganization plan Wednesday, saying it did not takeinto account the television ministry's poor financial health.   ``This plan does not work,'' Judge Rufus Reynolds said. ``Itdoes not reflect the situation.''   Reynolds gave bankruptcy Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton until Oct.1 to prepare a new plan, and until Sept. 10 to return withinformation on potential buyers for the ministry's assets.   Reynolds considered but rejected the idea of closing operationsdown, saying that would kill PTL's source of revenues, whichinclude donations from television viewers and proceeds from theHeritage USA Christian retreat near Fort Mill.   The ministry, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in June 1987after the resignation of founder Jim Bakker in a sex-and-moneyscandal, has been divided into the newly named Heritage Ministriesand a corporation holding PTL's assets.   The rejected reorganization plan would have given the trustee upto five years to sell assets and repay PTL's debts, which could bemore than $130 million.   After the 75-minute hearing, Benton said he would propose tosell the assets over a shorter period of six to seven months tosatisfy PTL's creditors and the court.   Benton did not say whether the rejection of the reorganizationplan would affect a proposal by Samoth Capital Corp., owned byCanadian businessman Peter Thomas, to buy PTL's satellitetelevision network, the Heritage USA property and 1,700 acres ofundeveloped property. Samoth has offered $113 million, but themoney would be paid over several years.   Benton said solidifying a sale within the next six to sevenmonths would let creditors know exactly how much they would receivemuch sooner than the five years allowed in the rejectedreorganization plan.   Benton said he expected to have a firm offer from Samoth bySept. 1, and possibly competing offers from Bakker; Charlotte,N.C., businessman George Shinn, who owns an NBA expansion franchisein that city, and an Oklahoma group he declined to name.   Both Reynolds and Benton said any potential buyer would need tomaintain a ministry on the property to support operations.   Reynolds also agreed to transfer $885,000 in proceeds from otherassets sales to the corporation holding the ministry's assets.Benton said the corporation has been losing $400,000 a month.   Reynolds did not act on a request for funds for HeritageMinistries, which Benton said was already some $400,000 in debt.   Afterwards, Heritage Village Church Pastor Sam Johnson blamedthe shortfall on legal expenses and the ministry's televisionprogram having to go through a name change.   He said he would once again appeal to ministry supporters forhelp and should know by the end of September the ministry's future.   ``If they respond we'll have a ministry. If they don't it willbe shut down,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
