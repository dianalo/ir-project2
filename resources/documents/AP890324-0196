Group Marks Anniversary Of British Journalist's Abduction</HEAD><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The wife of kidnapped British journalistAlec Collett, U.N. officials and fellow journalists appealedThursday for information about the hostage on the fourth anniversaryof his abduction in Lebanon.   A radical Moslem group has claimed that Collett was hanged inApril 1986 in retaliation for the U.S. bombing raid on Libya, andreleased a videotape purportedly showing his body hanging from ascaffold. His body was never found.   Collett was abducted on March 25, 1985, while on assignment withthe U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees. A grouplinked to Palestinian terrorists claimed responsibility for hisabduction.   ``We are heading into our fifth year,'' Collett's wife, Elaine,said Thursday during a service held by the U.N. Correspondents'Association. ``It must be several lifetimes for Alec. There seems tobe a lack of urgency concerning his whereabouts.   ``Have any of his fellow journalists let him down? Search yourhearts for solutions to get Alec and his fellow hostages home.''   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said in astatement that he and his senior staff were pursuing everyopportunity to obtain information about Collett.   Walid Mourani, president of the U.N. Correspondents Association,said his group was doing the same.   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing inLebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped on March16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
