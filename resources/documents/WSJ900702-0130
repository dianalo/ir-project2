Less effort has goneinto tracking the actual financial and structural conditionof an enterprise once control has been exercised by itsemployees. And even less research has been spent on employeeownership in those instances where employees are organizedand controlled by national unions.   As investors ponder the financing of the takeover ofUnited Airlines by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA),the International Association of Machinists (IAM), and theAirline Flight Attendants (AFA), they would do well to take acloser look at what union management has already cost thisonce-invincible airline.</LP><TEXT>   If the unions are successful, the employees will indeedown United, and will gain from improvements in profits thatresult. United will, however, be controlled by the unionleadership, despite the appointment of Chrysler's former No.2 man, Gerald Greenwald, as the chief executive if thebuy-out succeeds. While Mr. Greenwald certainly is qualifiedfor the position, his experience in union negotiations seemedto be paramount in his appointment. Thus, key decisions maybe made on a political basis rather than on a long-rangeeconomic basis, because union officials must make re-electiontheir prime objective.   To be sure, Mr. Greenwald will strive for a soundmanagement approach and there will be &quot;independents&quot; on thecompany board. But like Mr. Greenwald, they will be chosen bythe unions. Management personnel at United clearly understandthat being in the unions' good graces will help them holdtheir jobs, and any &quot;independent&quot; manager or board memberwill surely understand this too. But does all thisdecision-making power really affect the company's bottomline?   The pitfalls of union decision making at United are wellillustrated by the failed Frontier Airlines deal. Unitedcould have acquired this regional airline in 1986. But itneeded to maintain Frontier pilots' lower wages for fiveyears to make the deal profitable. The pilots union nixedthis proposed acquisition by refusing a wage deal, despitethe wishes of Frontier pilots whose jobs were at stake, anddespite the fact that the deal would have given Unitedcontrol of Denver, plus valuable planes, gates and hangars.   Here, ALPA stunted United's growth, and the airlineslipped behind American -- now No. 1 in the industry. Andwhen Frontier ultimately was taken over by Continental, itspilots were forced to work for much lower wages. The probablereason for ALPA's intransigence: A merger of United withFrontier would have added millions to the cost of ALPA takingover control of United. This kind of decision making -- plusthe sale of Covia, United's extremely valuable computerreservations system, to help finance the buy-out -- willlikely lead to a further loss of market share.   The democratic element of employee ownership is not alwaysapparent when union power and management control areconcentrated in the same hands. This also was illustrated byALPA's proposed United takeover agreement. The agreementreduces the seniority ranking of the pilots who were hiredduring its 1985 strike against United (or who crossed itspicket line). After the strike, ALPA attempted to have pilottrainees, who were not on the payroll during the strike,placed ahead on the seniority list of those who had workedduring the strike. The courts struck this down.   The proposed machinists union agreement also exhibitsunbridled union power. It sets terms and conditions fornonunion employees, for whom the IAM has no legal right tobargain. Most startling and sad is that the IAM deal givesthis union carte blanche to organize the thousands ofUnited's nonunion clerical and reservations employees whohave steadfastly remained nonunion and supported management.Unionization of this group will certainly not reduce costs.More significant is the desertion by current management ofthe employees who have supported it over the years. Such adeal is a clear demonstration of management subservience tounion power.   The unions have made much of their &quot;concessions&quot; as proofthat the takeover financing would be viable. But a close lookquestions that claim.   Each of the proposed contracts of the three unions are forfive-year periods, and promise no strikes. For mostemployees, these contracts establish &quot;book&quot; wage increases of4% a year, and then make &quot;concessions&quot; by providing wageincreases of 2% a year compounded. Also included are aprobable restoration of the fourth- and fifth-year book ratesin lump-sum form, and the right to negotiate -- or send toarbitration -- proposals for higher increases.   These vaunted &quot;concessions&quot; are in fact guaranteed wageincreases, regardless of business conditions for airlineemployees whose compensation averages 65% above the industrygenerally. The takeover will thus be saddled withever-increasing wage costs, which cast some doubt on thetakeover's viability.   Thus, while employee ownership and self-management maymake sense in certain instances, the concept should not beglamorized to the point where all forms are blindly acceptedas being more &quot;democratic&quot; and making economic sense. Whenunion power and management control are concentrated in thesame hands, the result, as may soon be demonstrated in theUAL deal, is likely to lead neither to fiscal responsibilitynor to more democratic participation by individual workers.   ---   Mr. Northrup is professor emeritus of management at theWharton School and has been researching airline laborrelations for more than 40 years.</TEXT></DOC>
