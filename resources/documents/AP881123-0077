Callers saying they were urban communist rebels claimedresponsibility for Tuesday night's attempt to kill Gen. Manuel JaimeGuerrero Paz, who was appointed defense minister just two weeks ago.   Surrounded by bodyguards, Guerrero Paz was leaving the DefenseMinistry at 8:15 p.m. EST when the 20-pound charge was detonated byremote control, police said. The blast destroyed a Toyota van andsent three bodyguards and their motorcycles into the air, they said.   The armor-plated Lancia automobile in which Guerrero Paz wasriding was not damaged, and its driver immediately drove it into thebuilding's courtyard, the ministry's press office said.   The explosion opened a hole in the pavement and blew out windowsof homes across the street from the Defense Ministry.   Three enlisted men who were guarding the minister were killed,and two others were hurt but out of danger in a police hospital, thepress office said.   People claiming to represent an arm of the communistRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla group called radiostations and claimed responsibility for the assassination attempt.   Guerrero Paz was named defense minister after President VirgilioBarco forced the resignation of his predecessor, Gen. Rafael ZamudioMolina, for ordering all-out war against leftist guerrillas.   The rebels have launched a recent campaign of terrorist attacksand sabotage that political analysts say have thrown the countryinto chaos.   Guerrero Paz promised last week to maintain the course advocatedby Barco, who seeks a negotiated political solution with leftistguerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
