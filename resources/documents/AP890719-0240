Employees affected range from clerical workers to upper levelmanagement in all 12 states where Santa Fe operates, said spokesmanRobert Gehrt.   ``Nearly all of these reductions are being achieved through avoluntary severance and early retirement program, although therewill be a limited number of involuntary separations,'' Michael R.Haverty, company president, said Tuesday in a news release.   Santa Fe Railway is a wholly owned subsidiary of Santa Fe PacificCorp. It operates approximately 11,500 miles of mainline freighttrackage linking Chicago with 11 other states, mostly in theSouthwest.   The railroad's total employment stood at 19,633 at the beginningof the year, and with Tuesday's announced cuts and other actions,the company said it expects a reduction to less than 18,000 by theyear's end.   More than half of those cuts have already been made, Gehrt said,and spokeswoman Susan Metcalf added that some of the remaining jobsto be eliminated involve normal attrition and retirement.   ``In order to survive and prosper in today's transportationenvironment, it is necessary that we provide high quality service atcompetitive prices. We must reduce our ongoing expenses if we are toaccomplish that,'' Haverty said.</TEXT></DOC>
