In many countries, among themDenmark, the calculation of tariffs is based on the costs of the utility,either book-keeping costs or marginal costs. However, the calculationof tariffs can also serve other purposes, for instance social purposes,consumption promoting or energy saving purposes, where the costs arenot determining the tariff. In the case of an energy saving tariff theamount immediately saved by the consumer as a result of the reductionof consumption is not in keeping with the reduction of costs obtainedby the utility, neither on a short nor on a long range. Therefore theutility has to raise the price of the remaining consumption. The consumeris very rarely aware of this connection. Is it fair to give the consumersuch a false price signal?</TEXT></DOC>
