(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A pregnant woman who asked to haveher 60-day jail sentence delayed so she could get an abortion wasrefused by a judge who retorted, ``So you can murder your baby _ isthat it?''   Pamela Forney, who began her third month of pregnancy this week,asked for a 10-day delay before the start of her sentence forviolating probation on a 1987 conviction of driving under theinfluence.   She said she needed the time because she was scared that whenshe got out of jail, it might be too late for a safe abortion.   Even though attorneys for both prosecution and defense agreed,Pasco County Judge Dan C. Rasmussen would have no part of it.   ``Being pregnant is not going to keep you from doing this jailtime,'' the judge said Monday before sending the woman directly tothe West Pasco Detention Center.``You want a continuance so you canmurder your baby _ is that it?''   A sobbing Ms. Forney pleaded with the judge, saying she isfinancially unable to care for a baby. Rasmussen suggested shecarry it full term and then give it up for adoption.   ``I thought it was my choice,'' Ms. Forney said in a jailinterview Tuesday. ``He's telling me I don't have a choice. It'snot right that he can choose for me.''   The decision provoked criticism from the American CivilLiberties Union, which moved Thursday to take over Ms. Forney'sdefense.   ``It's an outrage,'' said ACLU attorney Charlene Carres inTallahassee. ``Since when is the penalty for violating probationfor DUI a sentence of mandatory motherhood?''   Ms. Forney, a 26-year-old, part-time bartender, doubts thatshe'll have a job when she gets out of jail. She said she somedaywants children, but only when she can afford them.   ``I don't want to have to go on welfare, and I would have to ifI have a baby,'' she said. ``I knew when you went to jail you gaveup some rights, but the rights over your own body?''   In a statement, the judge said his personal views on abortionhad nothing to do with the sentence imposed.   ``It was only after the sentence was approved by the court thatthe defendant advised her attorney and the court of hercondition,'' Rasmussen said. He declined to comment further.   ACLU attorneys were considering whether to file an actioncontesting the sentence as cruel and unusual punishment, Ms. Carressaid.   Ms. Forney was arrested in December 1987 on a DUI charge. In1988, she was placed on probation, fined $250 and told to pay $100in court costs and $175 in public defender fees. She also was toperform 50 hours of community service.   She just recently finished the community service, but paid only$100 in her fines, court records show. Her probation violationcharge stemmed from her failure to pay.   At Monday's hearing, the judge asked Ms. Forney why she had notalready had an abortion. She said she did not yet have the money.Later, she said she had been saving money and this week's paycheckwould have given her enough.   ``He could have given me two or three days,'' she said. ``Itdoesn't take long. But now I may have to have a baby because thejudge doesn't believe in abortion.''</TEXT></DOC>
