McFarlane is named as an unindictedco-conspirator in the case against Oliver L. North and three otherIran-Contra defendants.   McFarlane was named in that capacity in the charge that theretired Marine lieutenant colonel and three co-defendants conspiredto divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits illegally to the Nicaraguanrebels, according to a defense brief filed Monday in the case.   The names of McFarlane and other unindicted co-conspirators inthe case are contained in a version of the indictment that wasfiled under seal in U.S. District Court.   But lawyers for North revealed McFarlane's legal status in arequest that North be tried separately from former nationalsecurity adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakimand retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord.   North's three co-defendants also filed motions for separatetrials.   Fawn Hall, North's former secretary at the National SecurityCouncil; Marine Lt. Col. Robert Earl, North's aide at the NSC; andJoe Fernandez, also known as Tomas Castillo, the CIA's formerstation chief in Costa Rica, were also identified in the defensebrief as unindicted co-conspirators.   Hall and Earl are cooperating with Walsh's investigation undergrants of immunity from prosecution.   The conspiracy count against all four defendants charges theyconspired illegally to set up the clandestine arms-supply networkto the Contras through a series of foreign companies with secretbank accounts in Switzerland.   As part of the conspiracy, the indictment charges, North andPoindexter made false statements to Congress and destroyed NSCrecords to thwart an investigation when the Iran-Contra affairbecame public in November 1986.   McFarlane, who resigned as national security adviser in late1985, has admitted to charges he gave Congress false assurancesthat his staff _ specifically North _ was not involved in givingcovert aid to the Contras at a time when direct U.S. military aidwas prohibited.   McFarlane traveled with North to Tehran in May 1986 on anarms-for-hostages mission, carrying a Bible signed by PresidentReagan and a cake baked in the shape of a key.   McFarlane, who is also cooperating with Walsh's investigation,could receive a prison sentence of up to four years and a $400,000fine for his guilty plea to the misdemeanor charges.   The defense motions were filed on a day that prosecutors madeanother attempt to obtain nearly 3,000 pages of diaries that Northkept while he was a White House aide.   Walsh, who tried unsuccessfully to subpoena the documents duringthe investigation, sought them during a routine request for ``anyand all notebooks, journals or ledgers kept by the defendants.''   The defendants said they needed to be tried separately in orderto use the congressional testimony of their co-defendants to provetheir innocence.   The defense contended that a joint trial would unfairlyprejudice the cases against them because all the defendants _except Secord _ testified before Congress under limited grants ofimmunity from prosecution.   The so-called use immunity grants prevent Walsh from using thecongressional testimony of individual defendants against them asevidence. But a defendant can use the immunized congressionaltestimony of a co-defendant to cross-examine that person during thetrial.   The defense, quoting a memo by Walsh, said that the testimonyMcFarlane gave after North's appearance was likely tainted becauseit was given in direct response to North's statements to theIran-Contra committees.   Neither McFarlane's lawyer, Leonard Garment, nor James Wieghart,a spokesman for independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, wouldcomment on the defense revelation.   Hakim and Secord, meanwhile, contended that they should be triedseparately because they are not accused of giving false testimonyto Congress or participating in a cover-up.</TEXT></DOC>
