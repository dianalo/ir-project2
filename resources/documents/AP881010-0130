The conservative Al-Anwar daily, which is based in Christianeast Beirut, on Friday quoted an unidentified source as predictingthat Waite would be freed in 72 hours.   Waite, 48, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his hotel inMoslem west Beirut for a rendezvous with the captors of twoAmerican hostages.   Lebanon's media has reported at least 25 times this year thatWaite or others among the 14 foreigners missing in Lebanon wereabout to be released. None was.   This year's release of five hostages _ three Frenchmen, a WestGerman and an Indian _ all were signaled in advance by communiquesfrom the captors.   None was independently predicted by Lebanese radio stations ornewspapers.   The weekly Ash-Shiraa magazine, which gained international fameafter breaking the story of the secret U.S. arms sales to Iran inNovember 1986, has published at least 10 erroneous predictions thata hostage release was imminent this year.   It reported Friday that the release last week of Indianprofessor Mithileshawr Singh, a legal resident alien of the UnitedStates, by Shiite Moslem kidnappers after 20 months in captivity,marked ``the beginning of the release of more American hostages.''   It said Waite would be freed ``very soon'' and American hostageswould be released before the U.S. presidential election Nov.8.   Waite was in Lebanon to help gain the freedom of Americans TerryAnderson and Thomas Sutherland when he disappeared. Although nogroup has claimed to hold him, Lebanese officials believe he isheld by Shiite extremists.   Anderson and Sutherland are held by Islamic Jihad, a pro-IranianShiite faction.   Apart from Waite, Anderson and Sutherland, seven otherAmericans, three Britons, an Irishman and an Italian are missing inLebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
