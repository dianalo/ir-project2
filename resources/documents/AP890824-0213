(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A restructuring plan announced by EastmanKodak Co. to bring in up to $1 billion in extra cash next yearprobably won't involve the sale of major divisions, analysts say.   Kodak officials said Wednesday that disappointing second-quarterearnings prompted the reorganization, under which it will eliminate4,500 jobs worldwide this year, or about 3 percent of its workforce, and sell or consolidate certain operations.   The company, which employs 145,000 people worldwide, including47,000 at its Rochester headquarters, previously announced plans tocut 1,000 jobs this year. That figure is included in the newcutbacks.   Robert Welk, a Rochester-based economics consultant, said paringthe payroll is wise because Kodak has too many employees comparedwith its competitors.   ``They're addressing what has to be done,'' he said. ``Itdefinitely is going to be a different company.''   ``It's not a massive restructuring,'' said Alex Henderson, ananalyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``It's a majorbelt-tightening, very much needed by Kodak.''   Company spokesman Paul Allen could not provide specifics on wherethe jobs would be eliminated.   The reductions will be targeted at divisions with combined salesof $1.25 billion, or about 7 percent of Kodak's overall $17 billionin sales last year, officials said. Kodak said it would sell, closeor reorganize those businesses to reduce operating costs.   The units most likely to be affected are smaller ones the companystarted or bought in the 1980s, analysts said.   Some have speculated its Information Systems operation, whichincludes copiers and microfilm and graphics equipment, would betargeted. That segment lost $144 million in the second quarter.   David Nelson, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., saidKodak apparently is avoiding ``a fire sale of assets.'' But, headded, ``You don't reassure your employees by leaving them to wonderwhether they're part of the $1.25 billion in businesses which are upfor grabs.''   Kodak laid off about 13,000 workers in 1986 and 10,800 in 1983.In both instances, profits rose substantially the next year.   ``We have dealt with adversity in the past, but never with suchbroad-based intensity,'' said Kodak's chairman and chief executiveofficer, Colby Chandler. ``These uncharacteristic actions are beingcarried out with great resolve by the entire management team.''   Chandler said the restructuring should improve operating resultsby up to $1 billion next year.   At company headquarters, Kodak said it would freeze workers' payin 1990 except in special cases and change the pay structure ofmanagers so it will be linked more closely to financial results.   Up to 40 percent of pay for top managers _ Chandler, PresidentKay Whitmore and Vice Chairman J. Phillip Samper _ will be tied tothe company's financial performance.   From 15 percent to 30 percent of the pay of other seniorexecutives and 15 percent of the pay of managers below the rank ofvice president also will be based on how well the company does,Allen said.   Chandler said divisions also would attack costs by cutting backon excessive inventories and shortening the length of time betweensales and receipt of payment.   On Aug. 1, the company announced earnings fell 85 percent in thesecond quarter, to $60 million, or 18 cents a share, from a record$390 million, or $1.20 a share, last year.   For the first half of 1989, earnings fell 60 percent to $260million, or 80 cents a share, from $650 million, or $2 a share, ayear earlier.   Kodak announced the restructuring after the stock market closedWednesday. Its shares rose $1 to finish at $50.75 in active tradingon the New York Stock Exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
