These include a maintenance shed,gun ammo and explosives buildings, and corrals. Other uses on the tractare an electrical sub-station, snow ranger house, powerline, and cemetery.Two permits to the Ski Corp. dated 11/02/83 are 30-year permits. The exchangepartner must recognize the continuance of the Special Use Permits or provideevidence that the permittee has agreed to relinquish the Special Use Permits.The exchange partner was selected from 7 proposals which were submittedin exchange for the federal land.Preliminary issues which have been expressed include:1. Potential development that might occur on the federal tract.2. Possible visual and other impacts from development of the federal tract.3. Obligations to special use permittees.4. Possible exchange of only part of the federal land; or exchange thefederal land with deed restrictions; or scenic easements to mitigate potentialimpacts on visual quality due to development on the federal tract.5. Avoid dividing existing land uses on the Federal tract by arbitrarilydrawing the west boundary at the 80 acre subdivision of the section.Alternatives for the Environmental Impact Statement have been formulatedusing the issues which surfaced during the previous scoping effort.1. No action. Do not complete the land exchange.2. Complete the land exchange with no restrictions on the federal tract.Teton County zoning requirements would be relied upon to mitigate the developmentand visual concerns.3. Complete the land exchange using mitigation measures to alleviate potentialdevelopment and visual concerns which have been expressed by the public.These mitigation measures could involve scenic easements given to a qualifiedpublic agency or non-profit conservation organization, deed restrictions,or reduction of acres. To equalize values reduced by mitigation measuresadditional federal land (10+ acres) would be added to the west side ofthe federal tract.The analysis is expected to take about 6 months. The draft environmentalimpact statement should be available for public review by May 1, 1990.The final environmental impact statement is scheduled to be completed byAugust 1, 1990. The comment period on the draft environmental impact statementwill be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's noticeof availability appears in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. It is very important that those interested inthis proposed action participate at that time. To be the most helpful,comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specificas possible and may address the adequacy of the statement or the meritsof the alternatives discussed (see The Council on Environmental QualityRegulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3).In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers ofdraft environmental impact statements must structure their participationin the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful andalerts an agency to the reviewers' position and contentions. <T3>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp</T3>. v. <T3>NRDC</T3>, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Environmental objections thatcould have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not raised untilafter completion of the final environmental impact statement. <T3>City of Angoon</T3> v. <T3>Hodel</T3>, (9th Circuit, 1986) and <T3>Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.</T3> v. <T3>Harris</T3>, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). The reason forthis is to ensure that substantive comments and objections are made availableto the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider themand respond to them in the final.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Brian E.
