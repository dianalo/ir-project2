LloydBentsen to draw attention to the Democratic vice presidentialnominee's support for aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.   Seeking to exploit the split on the Contra aid issue betweenDemocratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis and his runningmate, GOP leaders have jumped at the opportunity to spotlightBentsen's views on the emotional subject.   Unlike Bentsen, Dukakis has called Contra aid a ``failed andillegal policy'' that ``ought to stop.'' Dukakis says Bentsen'sviews don't bother him, however.   President Reagan, who coined the ``I'm a Contra, too'' phraseand routinely stings Democrats in his weekly radio address, hadnothing but praise for Bentsen's past record on Contra aid lastSaturday. He called Bentsen one of the ``strongest supporters'' ofassistance for the rebels.   And Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., on Tuesday quotedfrom a speech Bentsen delivered on Feb. 4, 1988, in which the Texancalled the Sandinistas ``violent revolutionaries _ men and womenwho are dedicated to spreading their brand of communism anywherethey can reach.''   ``I can only hope that Michael Dukakis and every other American,Republican, independent and Democrat, is listening, too,'' saidDole, author of a $47 million aid proposal for the NicaraguanContras seeking to oust the Sandinista regime. The package, whichincludes a $20 million escrow account for military aid, is pendingin the Senate.   On Tuesday, Bentsen said he would vote for a program thatprovides humanitarian aid to the Contras as well as ``fencedmilitary aid dependent on aggressive actions by the Sandinistas.''   Both Dukakis and Bentsen say they support a floundering regionalpeace plan advanced a year ago by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.   The Contras currently are receiving $17 million in assistancefor food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies. That moneyexpires at the end of September.   Neither Dukakis nor Bentsen has shied away from talking abouttheir positions on Contra aid, but some experts say the Democraticcandidates' divergence on the issue could put them in a ticklishspot.   Bentsen, for instance, is under pressure from liberal groups tooppose Contra aid.   ``A Bentsen `yes' vote on Contra aid will alienate millions ofDemocratic voters who care deeply about the Central American issue,and bring into question Governor Dukakis' sincerity about changingCentral American policy,'' the Council on Hemispheric Affairs saidin a statement. The group does research and releases policy papers.   ``This is going to be a real window into the Dukakis-Bentsenrelationship ... the first sign of what the nature of theirrelationship is,'' said Jay Winik, a congressional fellow at theCenter for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington thinktank.   How the Democrats handle the issue could provide clues intowhether Bentsen, as vice president, would help shape foreign policyor remain in the background in a Dukakis administration, saidWinik, a former aide to Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.   The so-called ``Reagan Democrats'' _ those whom Dukakis hoped tobring back into the party fold with his selection of a conservativeDemocratic running mate _ will watch Bentsen's actions closely, hesaid.   Aside from trying to take advantage of the Dukakis-Bentsensplit, Republicans are confident the Contra aid issue gives them adomestic political advantage at a time the Sandinistas' haveresorted to repressive tactics, said Richard Viguerie, aconservative fund-raiser.   In recent months, the Sandinistas have arrested oppositionleaders, closed an opposition newspaper and a Roman Catholic Churchradio station and expelled the American ambassador.   ``There is no mileage for the Democrats on the Contras,''Viguerie said. ``Democrats have lost more elections on thesoft-on-communism thing than anything else.''   John Burnstein, an associate at the Washington Office On LatinAmerica, a liberal group that is against aid, agrees the Democratswould be best served by keeping the ``issue off the front burner _which is not going to be easy.''   If the United States agrees to send military aid, ``you are justgoing to keep the thing on the front page,'' he said.   Democrats are aware that the issue is politically explosive. Inan effort to diffuse the charged atmosphere, a group of a dozen orso Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,are working to devise an aid package that could attract bipartisansupport.</TEXT></DOC>
