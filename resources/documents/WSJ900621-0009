When stock prices soared in 1987, the price of a seat onthe Big Board also rose to a record, with one seat changinghands at $1,150,000 -- triple its price of two years earlier.</LP><TEXT>   Stock prices again are close to record highs, but thestock of the exchange itself, as measured by the most recentseat sale price of $430,000, is languishing.   To put things in perspective, it now costs 42% more to getinto the business of flipping hamburgers at McDonald's, whichcharges $610,000 for a new franchise, than it does to buy aseat on the country's premier stock exchange.   &quot;{The exchange} had a terrific franchise for years, but{now} you have tremendous structural changes taking place,&quot;says George Bodine, managing director and head of stocktrading at Equitable Capital. &quot;You're seeing morefragmentation of the market. You're seeing more indexerstrying their utmost to reduce costs and transactelectronically.&quot;   The price of a seat, like the price of a restaurant or anyother franchise, reflects its present and anticipated futureearning power. And the earning power of a seat is suffering.   The 1,366 Big Board seats, in essence, convey a franchiseto buy and sell listed stocks on the exchange floor and tocharge a small commission to those who don't have access.Seats are owned by brokerage firms, independent floor brokersand the so-called specialists who each make a market incertain assigned stocks.   But institutions such as Equitable increasingly buy andsell Big Board-listed stocks in so-called third and fourthmarkets that circumvent the stock exchange. These includeJefferies Group's Posit, a highly automated system thattrades baskets of stocks off the exchange; Instinet, anelectronic order matching system owned by Reuters Holdings;and over-the-counter brokers such as Jefferies and Bernard L.Madoff Investment Securities. Jefferies and Madoff performmuch the same function as Big Board members -- except thatneither belongs to the exchange.   Thus, not only is the Big Board's volume down, but in thefirst quarter of 1990, only 68% of all transactions in BigBoard-listed stocks were actually conducted on the exchange.That was down from 85% in 1980 (though the Big Board stillhandled last quarter more than 80% of the total shares tradedin its own stocks).   One day this week, for example, First Boston Corp. tradednearly one million shares of Big Board stocks with 12different customers in London before the New York marketopened.   In addition, commissions are far lower than they werebefore deregulation. And with the rise of passive, orindex-oriented investing, the pressure is on for lowercommissions still.   &quot;The claim of indexers is that you're buying a commodityand that you should pay a commodity rate,&quot; says AustinGeorge, head of equities at T. Rowe Price Associates.   A traditional &quot;limit order,&quot; or an order to buy stock at aspecific price, is handled manually and entails a bigcommission. But such orders are on the wane. Passiveinvestors increasingly are buying stock over the Big Board'sautomated order system known as DOT, which can handle basketsof stocks at lower commissions. Or, they are buying asurrogate of the stock market in the form of Standard andamp;Poor's 500-stock index futures, which trade on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange. A seat on the Merc sold for $485,000yesterday.   In addition, brokerage firms, themselves under pressure tocut costs, are squeezing independent floor brokers to chargeless for handling trades. For all of these reasons, owning aseat is less lucrative than in the past.   &quot;The correlation between the market itself and seat priceshas broken down,&quot; says John Burke, an independent floorbroker or &quot;two-dollar broker,&quot; as they are known in thetrade. &quot;Guys on the floor have been under increasing pressureto decrease what they charge. You have anemic volume and youhave a lot of trading&quot; of Big Board stocks off the exchange.   &quot;If a two-dollar broker leases a seat,&quot; he adds, &quot;he hasto make about $200,000 a year in gross to afford the leaseand expenses. The average commission has gotten to a levelwhere it's unprofitable&quot; for some brokers.   Although stock exchange spokesmen declined to comment forthis article, the exchange is clearly aware that theirfranchise is under attack. Recently the Big Board unveiledplans to introduce afterhours and, ultimately, 24 hour-a-daytrading.   The notion that the exchange might succumb to anelectronic &quot;black box&quot; isn't new. Donald Stone, seniorpartner in the specialist firm Lasker, Stone andamp; Stern and avice chairman of the exchange, says that when he hears talkabout the demise of the exchange and of specialists he feels&quot;like Tom Sawyer attending his own funeral.&quot;   &quot;I am still here,&quot; he notes. &quot;I firmly believe that commonstocks are the investment of the future; the majority ofcompanies that went private in leveraged buy-outs will becomepublic again by re-selling stock.&quot; Mr. Stone's firm owns 8seats.   Another specialist, James Maguire, chairman of HendersonBrothers Inc., says, &quot;I am very bullish on seats.&quot; HendersonBrothers recently bought an additional seat, taking theirtotal to 19. Like Mr. Stone, Mr. Maguire thinks that therewill be a boom in stock issuance in the 1990s and that theresulting trades should spur &quot;new highs in seat prices.&quot;   Seats have in fact moved up from a five-year low inFebruary of $351,000. And at least in theory, the rentalmarket suggests that seats are a bargain. Investors can leasea seat to a user, such as a floor broker, for about $80,000 ayear; at today's seat price, that amounts to a hefty annualyield of 19%. But high yields often signal uncertain futures-- and few bodies have a murkier future than the Big Board.   &quot;What is the value of a seat? You don't know what kind ofexchange will be there {in the future},&quot; says the head ofequities at one Wall Street firm.   The number of companies listed on the Big Board continuesto climb, rising to a record 1,721 in 1990, including somenewly listed high-profile stocks such as L.A. Gear. However,overall volume this year, about 157 million shares a day, isrunning about 17% below its 1987 peak.   The Big Board's appeal is that, by matching the greatestnumber of buyers and sellers, it can set prices efficiently.Typically, orders are routed to a specialist's post; whenbuyers of a stock outnumber sellers, or vice versa,specialists step in to buy or sell stock, easing theimbalance. But as commissions have fallen, specialists'profits have dropped. As a result, investors say specialistshave become less willing to take risks.   &quot;The liquidity is gone and isn't going to come back,&quot; saysFred Moran, a portfolio manager. He says he's particularlyincensed by one specialist because &quot;if you go to this guywith 5,000 shares,&quot; he'll declare an order imbalance and haltthe stock. Mr. Moran, who began his career with GoldmanSachs, says that in the past &quot;we were willing to take a hitwhen commissions were 25 to 30 cents. At six cents a sharewho wants to put capital on the line?&quot;   Mr. Bodine, of Equitable, says that &quot;if there are two orthree buyers on the floor and I would be the fourth buyer, itmay be to my advantage if I can get the merchandise viaanother source.&quot; Commissions in off-exchange trades generallyare lower.   Even the exchange's proposal to expand into night tradingdilutes the value of a seat, some say, because the plan callsfor electronic trading, which would circumvent thespecialists. In effect, the afterhours exchange would becomeone more competitor to the traditional, daytime Big Board.   In fact, some say the very notion of a franchise in anelectronic market is anachronistic. Junius W. Peake, chairmanof the Peake/Ryerson Consulting Group, says exchanges&quot;shouldn't be clubs&quot; with members, but public utilities thatgrant wide access.   &quot;When the exchange talks about the possibility of anelectronic system, the value of a seat for a specialist oranyone else goes way down,&quot; says a senior official at onemember firm. He adds: &quot;I don't know that there's muchpossibility for a rebound with all this volume moving off theexchange.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
