Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.   The 18-member Cabinet was sworn in Friday night by PresidentGhulam Ishaq Khan. The ministry portfolios were announced today.   Defense was the only portfolio that was not assigned. Butanalysts say Sharif probably will keep it, following the traditionof his predecessors.   The new Cabinet is dominated by veterans of the Muslim League,the largest of 18 parties in the right-wing Islamic DemocraticAlliance that swept into power in the Oct. 24 parliamentaryelections.   Sharif, a 41-year-old industrialist who launched his politicalcareer during Zia's rule, was sworn in as prime minister Wednesdayto head the country's fifth civilian government in 43 years.   Sharif's Cabinet is one of the smallest, especially compared tothe record 58-member Cabinet of his predecessor, ousted PrimeMinister Benazir Bhutto.   Two of the most important portfolios will remain with veteranpoliticians who have links to the Zia era. They were also membersof the caretaker government handpicked by the president after hedismissed Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old government Aug. 6 on charges ofcorruption and mismanagement.   Sahabzada Yaqub Khan will remain foreign minister and SartajAziz will stay as finance minister.   Political analysts said there was only one surprise in thelineup - the establishment of a Narcotics Control Ministry. RanaChandar Singh, a Hindu minority member of Parliament, was appointedby Sharif to head the ministry.   Pakistan is one of the world's largest heroin-producingcountries. The United States heavily finances its anti-drugprogram, which several Western diplomats have criticized assluggish.   Pakistan's poppy crops are concentrated in a lawless tribal beltin the Northwest Frontier Province, bordering Afghanistan. It is astronghold of traditional orthodox Moslems and several Pakistaniobservers questioned Singh's ability to penetrate the area.   Since its creation in the 1947 partition of the Indiansubcontinent, Pakistan has been ruled by the military for more thana quarter century.   Zia, many of his top generals and U.S. Ambassador Arnold L.Raphel died in a mysterious plane crash in August 1988, clearingthe way for Pakistan's first free elections in more than a decadeand resulting in Ms. Bhutto's election Nov. 16 of that year.</TEXT></DOC>
