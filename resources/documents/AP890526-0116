Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., congressionalsources said today.   The two-way race for the No. 2 leadership post shaped up as,sources said, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., had decided againstseeking the job.   The jockeying came in expectation that Rep. Jim Wright, D-Texas,would resign as House speaker next week in the wake of charges thathe committed 69 rules violations and Majority Leader Thomas Foley,D-Wash., would replace him.   Gephardt had been urged by some House Democrats to challengeCoelho, whose own personal business dealings have come underscrutiny, to spare the party further embarrassment should an ethicsprobe ensue.   One source said Gephardt was interested in running for Coelho'scurrent job of majority whip, the No. 3 spot in the HouseDemocratic heirarchy.   Spokeswoman Deborah Johns said Gephardt was ``waiting to seewhat the speaker is going to do. He's listening to people and atthis time he just hasn't made a decision.''   Jenkins ``will be a candidate for the position when the speakerresigns,'' said a source close to the Georgia lawmaker, who isrunning with support from the powerful chairman of the House Waysand Means Committee, Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.   Rostenkowski ``usually supports the members of his committee andonly one of them (Jenkins) is in the race right now,'' said asource close to the chairman.   None of the House sources would allow their names to be used.   ``When a vacancy occurs for the position of majority leader, Ifully expect Tony Coelho to be in with both feet and running towin,'' said one source.   Asked if Gephardt would run against his close friend, Coelho,the source said, ``That's not going to happen.'' The sourceindicated the information came from a personal conversation betweenthe two congressmen.   Coelho spokesman David Dreyer would not reveal the Californian'sfuture plans.   Early in 1988, Coelho organized a campaign trip for severaldozen colleagues and lobbyists who flew to Iowa to boost thepresidential campaign of Gephardt. The two have remained close.   A group of Gephardt's supporters on Thursday urged him to run,viewing the Missouri Democrat as a ``white hat'' figure who couldhelp his party recover from the ethical problems that appear tohave ruined Wright's career.   Some House Democrats worried that ethics questions recentlyraised about Coelho's financial dealings could make him a politicalliability if the Californian succeeded Foley as majority leader.   But Coelho also is remembered fondly by many Democrats from hisdays as the Democratic congressional campaign chairman who doledout the money that got many of the lawmakers elected.   Coelho not only organized the campaign trip for Gephardt, butwas present for the ex-candidate's most triumphant moment duringthe 1988 Democratic primary season _ when the Missouri congressmanwon the Iowa precinct caucuses on Feb. 8 that year.   Wright is expected to resign next week just as he facesdisciplinary proceedings over House ethics committee charges of 69rules violations.   That would free Foley to move up to speaker and likely triggerraces for majority leader, majority whip and possibly caucuschairman.   Some House Democrats suggested that the party quickly elevateFoley and allow several weeks to pass before deciding on otherleadership positions.   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said he favors such a course, butadded that the Coelho camp wants the incumbents to quickly move upthe ladder.   Coelho's strongest support appeared to come from his ownCalifornia Democratic delegation, whose chairman, Rep. Don Edwards,said, ``We just think Tony has been the best whip in the history ofthe House, and deserves to be majority leader.''   Another Californian, Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., said he backsCoelho for majority leader but admitted that ``members will takeinto consideration the public reaction to the situation.''   ``We must make sure nobody who is in a replacement mode has anyimpediments that cause problems,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.``If we have a secondary ethics problem, it could be verycatastrophic for our party in the House. We're on somewhat shakyfooting now and need to re-establish our stability.'   News stories have detailed, and Coelho has confirmed, that aCalifornia savings and loan official purchased a $100,000,high-yield junk bond for the lawmaker in 1986 _ after Coelho foundhimself unable to finance the purchase himself.   A month later, the bank official sold the bond to Coelho for theinitial offering price, which saved the lawmaker about $4,000compared with the market price at the time.   House rules prohibit members from accepting gifts from anyonewith a direct interest in legislation. Coelho said he did notviolate House rules, and asked the ethics committee to review thetransaction.   On Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reported that the JusticeDepartment is conducting a preliminary criminal investigation ofwhether Coelho received favors from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,the firm that issued the junk bond.   Coelho said in a statement, ``I am confident the story isinaccurate and I so advised the Los Angeles Times, which chose togo ahead with the story anyway. In Washington's current atmosphere,such stories based on rumors or leaks are perhaps inevitable, butno less regrettable.''   The Associated Press reported earlier this week that Coelhoowned an interest in a dairy management company at the same time hewas pushing legislation to help maintain the profitability of somedairy farms.</TEXT></DOC>
