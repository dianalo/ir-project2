Frazee Jr.,chairman and chief executive officer.   In an interview -- conducted before GTE Corp.'s about $6billion bid yesterday for another telecommunications concern,Contel Corp. -- Mr. Frazee outlined Centel's efforts tostrengthen its cellular capabilities, seek regulatory changesfor its telephone operations, and boost its technologicalposition in an industry that he expects to prove &quot;more andmore competitive.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   GTE's Contel offer pushed up the stocks of many cellularand telephone concerns yesterday, and Mr. Frazee's enthusiasmfor the industry's prospects seem buttressed by yesterday'sdevelopments. Contel closed at $36.875, up $2.25, in New YorkStock Exchange composite trading yesterday.   Mr. Frazee also addressed the concerns recently voiced byboth major ratings agencies about the company's near-termprospects. Moody's Investors Service recently downgradedabout $1.2 billion in Centel debt, citing the company's&quot;aggressive expansion of its cellular operations.&quot;   Moody's said it thinks the &quot;capital expenditurerequirements, external financing burden, and earningspressure accompanying the development of these propertieswill result in increased business risk,&quot; although it notedthat the cellular operations &quot;can provide Centel withconsiderable cash flow and profit potential over the longerterm.&quot; Standard andamp; Poor's expressed similar concerns.   Much of Centel's debt stems from the company's $775million acquisition of United Telecom Inc.'s cellular-phoneoperations in 1988 -- a move that vaulted it into the topranks of the fledgling industry. The leverage is also linkedto Centel's subsequent outlays to solidify its positionthrough construction and staff increases, as well as anadditional $225 million in smaller cellular acquisitions.   &quot;Any time your debt is increased, risk is increased,&quot; Mr.Frazee said. &quot;I certainly can't dispute&quot; the ratingcompanies' contention that Centel's enlarged debt hasincreased its downside exposure. But &quot;we believe the ultimaterewards of the cellular communications business far and awayjustify the attendant risks,&quot; he said.   In the United Telecom deal, Centel paid an average ofabout $93 a &quot;pop,&quot; the industry term for potentialsubscribers. Analysts now put the value of those holdings atbetween $175 and $225 a pop.   The cellular operations &quot;may be double their worth,&quot; saysMr. Frazee, but &quot;we don't think they're anywhere near thelongterm value they're going to have.&quot;   Mr. Frazee says the company's cellular operations haverecently achieved a positive cash flow, on an operatingbasis, although it hadn't originally expected to reach thatmark until the end of the year. And &quot;we look forward topositive earnings before interest and taxes by the end ofnext year,&quot; also ahead of original plan.   The cellular industry &quot;is proving itself to be more thanjust a service for the business person or the affluent.&quot;Propelling the growth is an ongoing decline in the price ofcellular equipment for consumers.   The industry, however, &quot;isn't without its problems,&quot; Mr.Frazee concedes. Regional-service quality concerns andinadequate staffing, he feels, reflect a business that hasexperienced &quot;growth so rapid that the industry has sufferedfrom the same maladies cable TV suffered from&quot; in its earlyyears. Centel's heavy outlays in cellular construction andhiring are aimed at defusing such potential problems, hesaid.   The company, having repurchased about 16 million commonshares in the past two years under a 21-million-shareauthorization, has slowed its share purchases as it spends oninternal projects, Mr. Frazee said. But he continues to feelthe stock's recent price doesn't fully reflect the company'spotential.   So do some analysts. &quot;We think that stock should be worthat least $45 a share,&quot; said Joel D. Gross of DonaldsonLufkin, adding that investors made skittish by the company'scurrent price-to-earnings ratio aren't properly valuing thecellular operations' potential.   In the interview, Mr. Frazee also discussed the efforts ofthe company's Central Telephone unit to seek regulatorychanges. &quot;Telecommunications consumers need a regulatoryscheme that rewards, rather than penalizes, efficiency,&quot; hesays.   Central Telephone, which operates in nine states, isseeking changes in utility regulations that would permitincentives that would split cost savings between shareholdersand customers. The Central Telephone unit, which has spentheavily to establish modern digital and fiber-optic networks,would be in a strong competitive position if such incentivesare ultimately approved, Mr. Frazee said.   Mr. Frazee said he expects Centel's second-quarter resultswill be at the &quot;high end&quot; of the 10 cents to 15 cents a shareanalysts have projected. &quot;Given everything, I wouldcharacterize us as having a strong quarter . . . It's hardfor people to understand because of the losses {beingincurred for expansion}, but we're right on track and verypleased with our units.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
