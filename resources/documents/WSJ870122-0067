But however difficult it is to reckon from a distance who holds the military advantage, it's clear that the Gulf war is at one of those moments that compel attention.    This is not just for the scale of the immediate slaughter, though that is enormous, with thousands of corpses on the battlefield. In the past, single battles in the Gulf war have claimed more lives than all the Arab-Israeli fighting since 1948. Even against the backdrop of such a war the fall of Basra, a city of a million people, would loom large.    The capture of Basra would change the situation in important ways: tactically by putting the Iranians within potential striking distance of Kuwait; strategically by raising the question in capitals around the globe of just how far they will go, and politically by giving the Iranians a base from which to set up a government in opposition to the regime of President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. And it would present the Iranians with another opportunity for using religious passions to their advantage; for southern Iraq, like Iran, is predominantly Shiite Moslem, while the Iraqi government is dominated by Sunni Moslems.    Whether any of this will come to pass is something for which the world will have to wait. The Iranians are vowing to fight through to the conquest of Basra, while the Iraqi authorities are reaffirming that they have &quot;sufficient troops and weapons&quot; to crush any such assault. But it's not too soon to start thinking about what an Iranian breakthrough might mean for the West.    It could have positive elements, hastening the downfall of Saddam Hussein's government, one that, until it got into a military bind, was operating against every Western goal -- local, regional and global -- often hand-in-glove with the Soviets. It could also give the rulers of Saudi Arabia enough of a scare that they might actually let the Americans put some troops on the peninsula. That would place the West in a stronger position than before.    But an Iranian breakthrough would also mean profound dangers, the principal one being that nothing suggests the Iranians would stop at Basra. No gains that might result from injury to the Baghdad regime could compensate for an Iranian rampage through Kuwait and Saudi Arabia or for the damage Iran could do by extending its zealotry throughout that region.    As the world watches this grim scenario play out, President Reagan's attempt to simultaneously win the release of U.S. hostages and make contact with Iranian moderates inevitably factors into the equation. In recent days two Germans have been kidnapped in Beirut to use as bargaining chips for the alleged Lebanese terrorist arrested in West Germany. It's clear that this is a dirty business and that doing deals for hostages is a treadmill for Western governments. The initiative to Iranian moderates is another matter.    It is by no means a settled issue whether important officials in Iran exist who, unlike the fanatical Khomeini faction, understand there is a point at which military and strategic developments in the Gulf could become a great-powers issue. At that point Iran's future will depend on leaders with more political subtlety than the ayatollah, and in the hard calculus of this dangerous mess, these men would necessarily be called moderates. A year or so ago would have been none too soon to start looking for them. </TEXT></DOC>
