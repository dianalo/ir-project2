 We will treatthe announcements first, then turn to the patent brouhaha.andM;The announcementsandM;Adobe is clearly working hard to maintain its leadership in PostScriptimplementations and its position as the company that sets the PostScriptstandard.andP;  At the Computer Publishing Conference last fall, Adobe promisedthat it would make public the specifications for the proprietary Type Onefont format and announced that it would host a PostScript developer'sconference this spring, at which point it would lay out plans for the nextevolution of the PostScript language.andM;It kept its promise on Type One specifications when it passed out copies ofthe spec at the Seybold Seminars in March.andP;  It followed this action with theunveiling of the Emerald controller--the first RISC-based Adobecontroller--in April and May.andM;The most recent suite of announcements is the most impressive step yet.andP;  Wethink that Adobe has done exactly what it had to do in order to maintain itsinitiative.andP;  In particular, the announcements include:andM;1.andP;  PostScript Level 2, a &quot;second generation&quot; enhancement to the language.andO;It incorporates into PostScript features that had previously been found inapplication-specific language extensions, and it adds important newfacilities, especially in the area of color reproduction.andM;2.andP;  Adobe printer drivers.andP;  Adobe will supply its own printer driver softwarerather than relying on the computer system vendor to provide it.andM;3.andP;  Additional RISC controllers.andP;  Adobe is moving to RISC-based PostScriptcontrollers across its product line.andM;4.andP;  ATM for Windows 3.0.andM;5.andP;  Adobe PostScript controller for the LaserJet II.andM;PostScript Level 2andM;It is time for Adobe to put a new stake in the ground.andP;  User applications areoutgrowing the capabilities of the original &quot;Red Book&quot; PostScript definition.andO;PostScript Level 2 provides significant enhancements in virtually all of theareas of most concern to users.andP;  It will send PostScript clone vendorsscrambling to catch up.andM;Here is an overview of the most important additions in Level 2.andM;Extensions.andP;  Over the years, Adobe has developed application-specificextensions to the PostScript language.andP;  These have been incorporated intoLevel 2.andP;  They include:andM;1.andP;  Display PostScript.andP;  In order to improve the performance of PostScriptfor interactive display screens, Adobe added new operators and algorithms.andO;These are now available in Level 2 PostScript as well.andP;  They will yieldimproved performance for printer output just as they do for screen display.andM;2.andP;  ATM.andP;  As we have noted before, the rasterizing routine Adobe developedfor ATM yields both faster rasterizing and improved rendering quality at textsizes on low-resolution devices.andP;  The ATM rasterizing technology is alreadybuilt into the Hewlett-Packard PostScript cartridge for the LaserJet IIP andLaserJet III.andP;  As you can see from our tests published elsewhere in thisissue (see p. 47), the results are impressive.andP;  The ATM technology will beincluded with all PostScript Level 2 controllers.andM;3.andP;  Composite font technology.andP;  Adobe developed composite font technology tohandle non-Roman languages; it gets around the limit of 256 characters perfont by combining sets of primitives into a composite font.andP;  This technologycan support large character sets (such as Kanji) as well as vertical writing.andO;The technology has applications in Roman languages, as well; Adobe has foundthat many languages have so many diacritics they won't fit in the256-character limit either.andM;All of these PostScript extensions added up to significant improvements inboth functionality and performance of the language, but they were not a partof the base language, so you could not, for instance, use the very efficientrectangle-drawing Display PostScript operator in a file sent to a PostScriptprinter.andP;  By integrating these extensions into the base language, Adobeachieves two objectives: it assures the integrity of the language by poolingall of its PostScript technology, and it offers access to the added speedthat operators and algorithms in Display PostScript and ATM have.andM;Color and imaging.andP;  The most talked-about new features will almost certainlybe those related to color output and halftoning.andP;  Level 2 includes theearlier PostScript color extensions and adds the following features:andM;1.andP;  Compression/decompression.andP;  A number of compression/decompressiontechnologies will be supported for different purposes: CCITT Group III and IVfor monochrome bitmapped images, run-length encoding for grayscale data, JPEGfor color files, and ASCII85 for 7-bit communication channels.andP;  Thesecompression technologies should help conserve disk space by creating smallerfiles and improve performance by sending the files with images compressedover the network, thus reducing transmission time as well as networkoverhead.andM;2.andP;  Color halftoning.andP;  Adobe and Hell never reached agreement on the use ofthe Hell color screening patents in Adobe PostScript devices.andP;  Instead, Adobesays that it has developed its own improved algorithms for determining screenangles and screen frequencies of color separation screens.andP;  It claims thatthe results are &quot;nearly comparable&quot; to thoose achieved using the methodscovered by the Hell patents.andM;Adobe claims that its approach does not violate the Hell patents and that itis applying for its own patent.andM;3.andP;  Device-independent color spaces.andP;  The previous Adobe color extensionsinvolved support for RGB and CMYK color, black generation adn undercolorremoval, screen and transfer functions for four separate color components anda color image operator for rendering sampled color images.andM;PostScript Level 2 adds support for device-independent color.andP;  To cover mostbases, this includes support for CIELAB, calibrated RGB (also called CIEXYZ)and indexed color space.andP;  It also includes CIE-Y and CIe Lightness (theachromatic luminance components of the CIEXYZ and CIELAB models).andM;Standards for device-independent color are absolutely crucial for thedevelopment of open multivendor color systems.andP;  We expect that PostScriptLevel 2 will give major impetus to widespread support for CIELAB inparticular.andM;Increased sophistication.andP;  Other enhancements provide additionalsophistication:andM;1.andP;  Forms.andP;  One of the facilities PostScript has lacked is the ability tocache templates that can be invoked on command.andP;  Level 2 can accept inputdata streams, rasterize them, store them either in RAM or on the printer'shard disk, and merge them onto an output page on command.andP;  Because thetemplates are prerasterized, execution is very fast.andP;  Images stored in rasterform can eat up memory, but Adobe will take advantage of the compressiontechniques describe above.andP;  Where printer resources permit, images might alsobe stored as display lists or even uninterpreted PostScript code.andP;  In effect,Adobe will be treating such images the way fonts are handled today.andM;One obvious application is forms.andP;  Users can download a form or a library offorms of the printer, then print filled-in forms very quickly by invoking thestored form and sending only the variable data.andP;  But we can envision lots ofother applications as well.andP;  In general, this facility should be extremelyuseful whenever you want to use the same image repeatedly.andM;2.andP;  Patterns.andP;  New pattern operators will describe an image that can be tiledonto the page.andP;  A pattern tile can contain any arbitrary graphic, text orsampled image.andP;  Once the patterns are created, they are saved in a patterncache in order to improve performance.andP;  In addition, the patterns aredisplayed in a resolution-independent manner.andM;3.andP;  Memory management.andP;  Adobe has changed the way PostScript uses printermemory.andP;  Instead of segmenting memory to specific uses, Level 2 will make onepool of memory available and assign it dynamically.andP;  Automatic memoryreclamation will be able to recycle memory that is no longer needed.andP;  Theeffect of all thii should be a more efficient use of memory, an eliminationof an arbitrary memory limit, and the ability to use all of the memory inprinter upgrades.andM;4.andP;  Device-specific support.andP;  The language will include device-independentoperators for printer-specific features: payer trays, paper sizes, staplersand sheet feeders.andM;Compatibility.andP;  Since PostScript Level 2 is essentially an evolution of theexisting PostScript standard, applications that support PostScript will beupwardly compatible with Level 2.andP;  What existing applications will lack willbe the ability to use many of the functional and speed advancements found inLevel 2.andP;  But we expect that to change quickly.andP;  Application developers haveeverything to gain by making use of the new features.andM;Existing Level 1 printers will be able to print documents composed with Level2 features provided there is an intelligent printer driver to substitute theappropriate data.andP;  Such a driver will be required to know something aboutboth Level 1 and Level 2 commands to be able to translate Level 2 commandsinto commands that Level 1 machines can handle.andM;Although there are occasions where command substitution will be needed, lmostof the time a simpler solution will be available: printer drivers that knowwhether the printer can accept Level 2.andP;  The driver might be able tointerrogate the printer (where both are on a network), or it might read aprinter-description file.andP;  Where the printer has Level 2 capability, thedriver will use the newer features; where not, the driver will fall back toLevel 1 functions.andM;Level 2 is set for release in early 1991.andP;  Adobe expects that each OEM willevaluate wheter its products can support the new functionality and whetherthe upgrade makes business sense.andP;  Level 2 will require 1.5 MB of RAM and 1.5MB of ROM.andP;  This is a higher minimum hardware level than Level 1 needs, so itmight not be indicated for rock-bottom-priced-products.andP;  Adobe's royaltyschedule to OEMs will remain the same.andM;A new &quot;Red Book,&quot; the POSTScript Language Reference Manual, Second Edition,will be published by Addison-Wesley.andP;  It will document the entire PostScriptlanguage: Level 1, Level 2 and Display PostScript.andP;  The book is expected tobe available in the fourth quarter of this year.andM;The future.andP;  Adobe has high aspirations for the PostScript language.andP;  Itsvision of the future is all-electronic distribution of documents.andP;  To achievethis goal, data will have to be in a common, editable format.andP;  Adobe wantsPostScript to be that format.andM;Beyond the printed document, Adobe is planning to integrate sound and videointo PostScript eventually.andP;  Stay tuned.andM;Printer driversandM;In order to be able to increase system throughput by taking advantage of allLevel 2 features, Adobe has decided to start writing its own printer drivers.andO;Adobe also expects its drives to provide much faster printing on Level 1printers, because it knows a lot about writing efficient PostScript code.andM;It does not intend to build printer drivers for every environment.andP;  Rather,it will start by introducing printer drivers for the largest market segments:Macintosh, Windows 3.0 and 0s/2 Presentation Manager.andP;  For other segments,Adobe will provide a library of routines to allow third parties to developtheir own drivers.andM;Printer controllersandM;Adobe intends to provide a number of PostScript controllers for numerouspoints along the price/performance path.andP;  Last month it announced a newhigh-end RISC processor controller, the Emerald (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  9).andP;  Nowit has announced two other RISC-based controllers designed for theunder-10-page-per-minute market.andM;Using a Weitek 8220 microprocessor, the Sapphire controller can run at 16 or25 MHz and includes an on-chip instruction cache.andM;The Ruby controller uses an Intel 80960-KB microprocessor running at 20 MHzand includes an on-chip floatingpoint unit.andM;According to Adobe, the future of PostScript controllers definitely lies withRISC technology.andP;  For PostScript controllers, CISC microprocessors are at theend of their life cycle, and RISC microprocessors at the beginning of theirs.andM;PostScript cartridgeandM;Looking to tap into the huge base of some 2.5 million LaserJet IIs andcompatibles, Adobe will offer a PostScript cartridge for LaserJet II seriesprinters.andP;  Adobe claims that its PostScript cartridge is from 1.5 to 3 timesfaster than PostScript-compatible cartridges available on the market today.andO;The Adobe cartridge uses Adobe Type Manager technology for rasterizing type.andM;Included with the cartridge are the standard 35 typefaces in ROM as well asscreen fonts for display.andP;  Additional faces will be available as downloadedfonts, individually or in sets with type cartridges.andP;  Initially there are twotype cartridges.andP;  Adobe Type Cartridge 1: Display Faces has 15 differentdisplay faces, while Cartridge 2: Best Sellers offers 19 of Adobe's mostpopular faces.andP;  The type cartridges work in conjunction with the PostScriptcartridge; they will not work with third party PostScript cartridges.andP;  Theseproducts will only work on the LaserJet series II printers.andM;To use the Adobe PostScript cartridge, a LaserJet II must have at least 1.5MB of RAM.andP;  The PostScript cartridge will have a suggested retail price of$495 and the type cartridges will be $395 each.andP;  They will be available inJuly.andP;  Since this is suggested pricing, the street price is expected to befar less.andM;ATM for WindowsandM;At a recent analyst briefing, Adobe showed ATM for Windows.andP;  The immediatething that struck us was show similar the product was to the Macintoshversion; it looks and works the same.andP;  Like the Mac version, ATM for Windowscan generate bitmapped fonts that can be used to drive non-PostScriptprinters.andP;  This means that you will be able to print Adobe fonts on your dotmatrix printer or download Adobe-generated character bit-maps to anon-PostScript printer.andM;The product will ship with the basic four type families: Times, Helvetica,Courier and Symbol.andP;  An add-on package containing the other typefaces foundin most PostScript printers will be available as the &quot;Plus Pack.&quot;andP;  Two othertype packages will also be sold, each containing seven display faces.andM;ATM for Windoww will have a suggested retail p rice of $99; the Plus Packwill be $198; and the additional type packages, Adobe Type Set 1 and 2, willeach be $99.andP;  Again, this is suggested pricing; street prices should be farless.andM;Xerox and AdobeandM;Adobe has announced a general PostScript licensing agreement with XeroxCorporation.andP;  There are no products to announce at this time.andP;  This probablymarks the final step in the evolution of Xerox from its own Interpress pagedescription language through PostScript clones and ultimately to acceptanceof Adobe PostScript.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
