It was proposed to replace the number of counts on theleft and right limit of the peak by other numbers obtained as a resultof manifold parabolic interpolation according to Bessel. A ratio of varianceof modified and unmodified TPA methods was calculated for various ratiosof peak area to background and for various FWHMs. For small values ofthe peak area to background ratio, the variance ratio is about 0.5.</TEXT></DOC>
