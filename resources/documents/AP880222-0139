SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic presidential candidate MichaelDukakis derided President Reagan's anti-terrorism policies onMonday as worthless in light of the Iran-Contra affair, promptingReagan's spokesman to retort that candidates shouldn't make ahostage situation a political issue.   The Massachusetts governor, using the White House as a backdropafter a meeting of the National Governors' Association with Reagan,issued a stinging critique of the administration's Iran-Contrainvolvement and the problems it might pose for the next president.   Asked how he would respond to the latest hostage-taking, Dukakissaid, ``You never, ever make concessions to terrorism. If you everdo it, then your policy is worthless. And that's what we did.''   Referring to the sale of arms to Iran during secret negotiationsto free American hostages, Dukakis said, ``We'll be living with theconsequences of what happened for a long time.''   His remarks came as the administration struggled to deal withthe kidnapping of another American in Lebanon, Lt. Col. William R.Higgins, a Marine detailed to a U.N. truce-monitoring force.   Queried by reporters, Dukakis said he would have ``a muchtougher, and much more consistent anti-terrorist policy'' thanReagan.   ``What happened in 1985 was devastating ... to our ability to becredible when it came to putting together a very tough,no-compromise policy on terrorism,'' he said.   ``This is international crime, pure and simple, and you fight itthe way you fight crime _ with tough police work, with effectiveundercover operations, with military operations against terroristbase camps if necessary,'' the governor added.   Dukakis' remarks brought a quick rebuke from presidentialspokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   ``I think it's very dangerous to make terrorism a politicalissue, especially when you're talking about specific episodes,''Fitzwater said.   The spokesman asserted that past experience has shown that``there are any number of aspects to individual hostage-takingsthat can be exacerbated by political talk or media talk orpolitical statements.''   ``I would simply urge caution on everyone's part, includingpolitical candidates,'' he said.   Besides hitting Reagan's performance on terrorism, theMassachusetts governor took advantage of the attention of the WhiteHouse press corps to question Reagan's approach to welfare reformand child care.   On a strictly political topic, he also said he was heading intoTuesday's South Dakota and Minnesota contests aiming to prove hehas wider appeal than shown by his New Hampshire primary victory.   ``If I can do well out there, that will be proof positive thisis a national campaign, and a national candidacy,'' he said, addingthat he hoped victories there would be a boost for the multipleshowdowns March 8 on Super Tuesday.   Dukakis joked that he'd used the governors' visit to look theWhite House over as a possible residence. ``No commuting, don'teven have to take the street car, just walk to work _ it'sterrific,'' he said with a broad smile.   As dozens of camera and microphone-toting technicians andcorrespondents crowded around him on the White House lawn, Dukakiseven offered to ``meet with the press two or three times a week''if he were elected.   And to reporters' delight, he dangled the option of Hawaiianwinter vacations before the oft-traveling pack.   It would be tough to top Santa Barbara,'' one correspondenttaunted when the subject came up, noting the lush California resorttown near Reagan's vacation ranch.   ``How about Cape Cod _ what do you think?'' asked theMassachusetts governor with a grin.   Mild murmurs of approval were made. Then, a query about hiswinter vacation plans.   ``The Berkshires,'' Dukakis replied firmly, only to be met bysilence.   Sensing a need to offer a new slant on the subject, thecandidate quickly shifted gears.   ``On the other hand, my wife expressed a preference for Maui theother day,'' he offered.   Cheers erupted from the crowd.</TEXT></DOC>
