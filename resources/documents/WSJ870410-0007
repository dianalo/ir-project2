Market jitters raise new concern about his tenure.    Some Wall Streeters urge an early reappointment of the Fed chief to calm unstable markets. &quot;If the president is going to reappoint the chairman, it would be a very good thing to do it right now,&quot; says Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman. But most White House insiders don't expect a decision before June at the earliest.    White House chief Baker is sensitive to fears that Volcker's departure would cause further market disruption. But Volcker opponents argue for naming a GOP loyalist who might be more accommodating during the 1988 elections. A new candidate to replace the Fed head is Treasury Undersecretary George Gould. But economist Alan Greenspan remains a favorite.    In a move that wouldn't endear Volcker to Reaganites, the Fed may have to raise interest rates to keep the dollar from plunging.    STAR WARS SUFFERS from lack of an administration strategy.    Reaganites grope for ways to move ahead on the missile-shield project. They all but give up efforts to loosen the interpretation of the ABM treaty, partly for fear that opponents of such efforts would seek even deeper budget cuts in Star Wars. A push for Reagan to set a deployment schedule also fizzles. &quot;The decision is still some time away,&quot; a defense official says.    It is a &quot;tragedy&quot; that the administration became ensnarled in a &quot;lawyers' debate&quot; over the ABM treaty, gripes Indiana Sen. Quayle. Such backers worry that funding support will dry up unless the program can be moved out of the research incubator. At a White House meeting, conservative leaders vow to make Star Wars their No. 1 priority in the 1988 elections.    GOP HOPEFULS scramble the party's presidential picture.    A likely Laxalt bid undercuts claims by Bush and Kemp to the Reagan mantle. &quot;When the president's best friend runs, it changes the dynamics,&quot; says GOP candidate du Pont. The presence of Nancy Reynolds, a friend of Mrs. Reagan, as a Laxalt adviser reinforces the Reagan ties. Nevertheless, conservatives applaud Kemp's early emphasis on defense and family issues.    Du Pont predicts a &quot;generational semifinal&quot; between himself and Kemp and between Dole and Bush. Dole begins a blitz of town meetings in Iowa to try to put Bush on the defensive there. Robertson, back from Israel and hurt by the unholy war among TV ministers, plans a new effort to win Jewish votes. Moderates search for a candidate; some think former Tennessee Gov. Alexander may run.    Former Arizona Sen. Goldwater is expected to join the Bush campaign as national co-chairman in a move to win conservative backing for the vice president.    SHULTZ PLANS to probe for Soviet flexibility on strategic arms, too, during his talks next week in Moscow on eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. Top U.S. officials want to press for deep cuts in long-range missiles. Shultz will explore whether Gorbachev might soften his demands for tight restrictions on Star Wars.    PAC PROTEST: The huge American Medical Association and National Association of Home Builders political-action committees boycott the Democratic congressional campaign groups' annual dinner to protest the Senate leadership's support for PAC-donation limits. &quot;Ordinarily, we would contribute to the maximum,&quot; says a builder official.    ON THE ROAD AGAIN: More presidential trips are planned to deflect attention from the Iran-Contra flap. Staffers urge Reagan to use the presidency as a &quot;bully pulpit&quot; to promote such issues as &quot;family values.&quot; &quot;Everybody feels he is most effective when he's out of Washington,&quot; one aide says.    TIMELY EXODUS: Several Pentagon officials depart before a law takes effect April 16 barring procurement aides from taking jobs with contractors that they do business with. But a study ordered by the law's co-author found that only 645 of 5,755 defense employees who joined contractors in 1983-84 would have been affected by the ban.    NASA SLIPS in its struggle to regain momentum from space setbacks.    The agency's first full-scale test-firing of a shuttle booster rocket since last year's tragedy is put back to mid-May from late March. Its recent loss of a rocket launched during a nearby thunderstorm stirs new criticism in Congress. &quot;What in the world is driving this kind of decision-making?&quot; asks Rep. Walker, the ranking Republican on a space subcommittee.    NASA will seek to recoup in the Senate some of $1.1 billion expected to be cut by the House from its proposed budget. Scientists also worry that Reagan's scaleback of the space station will leave many worthwhile experiments earthbound. To bounce back, some suggest a dramatic, long-term space exploration.    &quot;Mars,&quot; says one NASA official, &quot;is a hot topic around here.&quot;    MINOR MEMOS: A letter addressed only &quot;Model-Secretary, Washington D.C.&quot; is delivered by the post office -- correctly, as it turns out -- to Fawn Hall at the National Security Council. . . . After spending months to get into an elite group of finance ministers, Italy's Giovanni Goria has to leave early -- because his government collapsed. . . . EPA trivia: What is the only major-league-baseball city that meets federal clean-air standards? Answer: Minneapolis-St. Paul. </TEXT></DOC>
