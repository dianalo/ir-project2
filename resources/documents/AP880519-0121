The Senate voted 91-6 Wednesday to reject the first conservativeattack on the treaty. That was a point of order raised by Sen.Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who claimed Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachevwasn't authorized to sign the pact and the Senate therefore shouldnot ratify it.   ``The first vote would indicate the Senate did not think it wasa serious point. I did not think it was,'' said Byrd.   Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said, ``we need to get someaction...We need to have the debate, have the vote, and move on.''   ``I feel a particular responsibility in this instance'' becausethere is a Republican in the White House and Republicanconservatives are the chief critics of the treaty, Dole said.   ``The burden is on the Republicans to move this along,'' saidDole, noting that the only proposed amendments have been spelledout by members of his party.   ``Maybe we could even get lucky and finish this by next Tuesdayor Wednesday,'' said Dole. ``I hope we continue to expedite thisprocess.''   Reagan leaves Wednesday for his Moscow summit meeting withGorbachev and he has said he hopes he take a ratified treaty withhim.   After the vote late Wednesday, Dole said, ``I think the votewe've just had is an indication of the strong support we have forthis treaty. Let's get on with it.''   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., agreed with Dole. ``Let's do our work.Let's not fool around, which I think we are doing to a large extenton the amendment that was just defeated. ... I don't know whatbenefit there is in waiting until after the summit begins to ratifythis treaty.''   ``There is no cause for further, untimely delay,'' said Exon.   Sen. Robert Stafford, R-Vt., said ``the American people want thepresident to have a ratified treaty in his briefcase when hemeets'' Gorbachev.   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, signed Dec. 8 byReagan and Gorbachev, calls for the elimination of all missileswith a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles.   Helms contended that because Gorbachev was signing as thegeneral secretary of the Soviet Union's Communist Party, herepresented a political party and not the Soviet state.   ``This document now at the desk is not binding on the SovietUnion. It is only an agreement between the president of the UnitedStates and the head of a foreign political party,'' said Helms.   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, agreed with Helms, noting that ``ifGorbachev is removed from power someday, they could easily comeback and say he was only the head of the Communist Party andtherefore the treaty is invalid.''   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., responded that ``there is nosubstance whatsoever to the claim that the treaty was not legallysigned. ... Treaty making is a matter of common sense and wisejudgment.''   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign RelationsCommittee, said there was no question that Gorbachev wasrepresenting his nation when he signed the pact.   ``It is clear that Mr. Gorbachev and no one else in thatdelegation was the chief representative of the Soviet Union,'' Pellsaid.   Helms rejected what he said he were insinuations that he wasraising technical points simply for the sake of delay. ``What isoccurring is not dilatory, but is instead and, in fact,deliberative,'' he told his colleagues.   The Senate still faces an unresolved fight over the legalinterpretation of treaties.   That dispute arises from Reagan's claim that he has the legalright to unilaterally change how a treaty is viewed by the UnitedStates. He has asserted that right in relation to the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   Democrats who control the Senate have added an amendment to theINF pact which says no future president can reinterpret the pactwithout Senate approval. Republicans object to the addition.   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said Wednesday that theinterpretation amendment was a ``booby trap'' that ``createsconfusion and confrontation.'' He called it ``a turf battleextraordinaire in which the Senate is seeking primacy in thetreaty-making process.''   But Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., disagreed, arguing that theSenate should protect its rights. ``If we do not do this, theSenate's role in treaty-making will be completely obliterated,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
