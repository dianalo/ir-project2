After all, month-to-month fluctuations in economic indicators aren't new, but recent swings have been confounding.    Well, blame it largely on the new tax law -- with the weather getting a supporting role.    Last year ended on a spurt of activity as consumers rushed to beat the law's curtailment of many tax breaks, including the sales-tax deduction, and businesses sought to purchase goods under the old law's more generous depreciation schedules. Paced by surging auto sales, retail sales gained 4.4% in December from the previous month, and orders for big-ticket factory goods jumped 5.3%.    The rosy picture quickly faded, however, as the tax law took effect Jan. 1. January statistics described an economy stumbling badly: Big-ticket factory orders plunged 9.9% and retail sales fell a record 7.4% as car sales nosedived.    But the figures for February show the economy booming again with retail sales rising 4.1%, industrial production gaining a strong 0.5% and major orders up 6%.    &quot;I've never seen so much volatility,&quot; says Aubrey Zafutto, vice president for economics at J. Henry Schroder Bank andamp; Trust Co. in New York.    The tax-law change is playing havoc with other statistics as well. For example, the legislation included disincentives on consumer-debt growth. Among other provisions, the tax law phases out the deductibility of consumer-debt interest costs.    An initial look at the Federal Reserve Board's latest consumer-credit statistics suggests the disincentives are already hugely successful. Credit growth has slowed sharply in the last few months. Revolving credit and a category called miscellaneous credit, which includes cash loans and certain retail transactions, actually declined in January.    Closer analysis, however, suggests that consumer borrowing isn't drying up so fast. The Fed and private economists say that the slowdown in credit growth reflects the substitution of home-equity loans, which aren't included in the credit statistics, for credit-card debt and other borrowing that are included.    But the government doesn't keep separate figures on home-equity loans, which are lumped together with mortgage lending, so it isn't possible to know whether the overall debt burden of consumers is increasing rapidly or slowly.    The tax law is also distorting personal income and spending statistics. Disposable personal income, the amount of money people have to spend, is apparently being buoyed in the first quarter by the W-4 fiasco. Because of confusion over the withholding form, millions of people have failed to adjust their tax payments to the new law, and many have been receiving too much take-home pay. Partly for this reason, disposable after-tax income rose 1.2% in February, while personal income increased 0.9%.    &quot;Clearly it is boosting income and I think it's probably boosting spending to some extent,&quot; says Kathleen Cooper, chief economist at Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. But since the tax-law change will mean higher take-home pay for many, &quot;it's hard to differentiate how much should be happening and how much shouldn't be,&quot; she says.    These tax overhaul-related blips, unfortunately, are striking just as the statistics are being distorted by the weather. Most indicators are adjusted for predictable seasonal variation, but that can be tricky in the winter, especially for data on the construction and housing industries, where activity slows markedly.    Richard Peterson, senior vice president at Continental Illinois Bank in Chicago, suggests that some of the recent strong employment gains, especially for construction, reflect the unseasonably warm weather this winter in some regions.    Finally, periodic revisions of several major indicators are skewing the figures. For example, following revision of the consumer-credit statistics, which partly reflected updated seasonal-adjustment factors, credit growth in November was slashed to a 1.6% annual rate from the previously reported 6.7%. Seasonal updating of the unemployment statistics changed the jobless rate for six of 11 months in 1986. The consumer price index was updated this year to reflect changes in spending patterns and shifts in population.    The distortions are likely to ease as the economy adapts to the tax law, warmer weather and updated data. Meantime, where is the economy going? Most economists think growth is picking up somewhat from the fourth quarter's paltry 1.1% annual rate. Others say it will top 3%. </TEXT></DOC>
