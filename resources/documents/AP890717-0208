The 24-hour stoppage over pay was one of a string of walkoutscreating the worst industrial unrest of Prime Minister MargaretThatcher's 10 years in power.   Railwaymen, city hall employees and dock workers were alsostriking or engaged in sporadic walkouts and firefighters atLondon's Heathrow airport were discussing a strike which could closethe world's busiest international airport next week.   Unions were angered by pay hikes lagging behind a nationalinflation rate of 8.3 percent, the highest in the 12-nation EuropeanEconomic Community, while dock workers were demanding retention ofnational bargaining.   The capital faced more travel chaos on Tuesday in a fifthcombined one-day strike that would all railway trains in Britain andthe London subway.   The National Union of Railwaymen, which has started weeklyone-day strikes, was meeting to discuss a revised pay offer by theBritish Rail board, which hiked its rejected 7 percent increase to8.8 percent last week.   The train crews' union, the Associated Society of LocomotiveEngineers and Firemen, has banned voluntary overtime and rest-dayworking indefinitely, causing cancelation of trains.   British Rail was hoping Monday's negotiations might get Tuesday'sstrikes called off but union leaders said that was unlikely as therewould not be time to ballot their members.   A three-day strike over pay by 500,000 white collar workersemployed in public services by city halls throughout Britain was setto start at midnight Monday, the third walkout in three weeks.   The city hall strikes stop care services for children and theelderly, shut slaughterhouses as meat inspectors are not availableand close local tax offices, museums and libraries.   On the seventh day of an indefinite national docks strike at 60of the country's 162 ports, dock workers' leaders from Belgium,France and West Germany were expected in London to discuss possiblesolidarity action at European ports.   The visitors were meeting at the headquarters of the 1.4 millionmember Transport and General Workers Union, Britain's largest laborunion. The union organized the strike in support of demands thatport employers maintain national bargaining after the abolition of agovernment system guaranteeing dock workers' jobs whether they hadcargoes to handle or not.   The union said the International Transport Workers Federationcalled the one-day conference to discuss the British strike and thatthe Dutch had already asked their members to organize sympathyaction.   The 80 firefighters at Heathrow airport were balloting overstrike action in protest at the airport's rejection of their claimfor a 20 percent pay hike.   A spokeswoman for the management said: ``The airport has to havefire cover for operations, so potentially operations could shut downif there was a strike.''</TEXT></DOC>
