Toshiki Kaifu became the leading choice to replace Sousuke Uno,who has been in power only two months, after 78-year-old ToshioKomoto said he would not run for president of the deeply troubledLiberal Democratic Party.   That cleared the way for Kaifu, Komoto's protege, whosecandidacy drew support from other factions in the conservativegoverning party.   ``I'm overwhelmed by the honor and will do my best,'' Kaifu saidat a news conference after Komoto's faction, with 30 members one ofthe smallest in the party, united behind him.   Kaifu, who earlier had said he supported Komoto for partyleader, was the only declared candidate for the post. The LiberalDemocrats' president is certain to be elected prime ministerbecause of the long-governing party's commanding majority in thelower house of parliament.   Kaifu said it was too early to speak in detail about hispolicies, ``but political reform is the biggest issue that has beenraised by the people.''   He said he had received about $110,000 in political funds overfive years from the Recruit Co. conglomerate at the center of theinfluence-buying scandal that originally rocked the politicalestablishment in Japan.   But Kaifu said all the donations had been reported, and that hehad stopped receiving money from the company after the scandalemerged last year.   The Liberal Democrats are to choose a new leader on Tuesday.   Uno is resigning to take responsibility for the setback in theJuly 23 election in which the Liberal Democrats lost their majorityin parliament's upper house for the first time in the party's 34years, with opposition Socialists gaining strongly.   Komoto, whose faction ranks a lowly fifth in size among theparty's power blocs, told reporters he had decided not to be acandidate after canvassing opinion in the party, where many memberssay they want a younger president to help repair the party's image.   ``I've decided that having Kaifu run is the most appropriate andthe best,'' the party elder said.   Kaifu, a 10-term member of the lower house, was a follower ofthe late Prime Minister Takeo Miki, who led the government from1974 to 1976 following Kakuei Tanaka's scandal-plaguedadministration.   Miki was known as the ``Mr. Clean'' of Japanese politics forefforts he made to throttle back corruption, and Kaifu served asdeputy chief Cabinet secretary under Miki.   Later, Kaifu served twice as education minister, totaling abouttwo years.   He is a member of the party reform committee that was set up inthe wake of the Recruit scandal.   The Liberal Democrats, in power for more than three decades,have lost popularity amid a series of scandals that accentuated theparty's image as arrogant and complacent. The party also railroadedthrough Parliament a new 3 percent sales tax that is extremelyunpopular.   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita stepped down June 2 because ofthe party's low popularity and was succeeded by Uno, whosescandal-free image quickly crumbled amid allegations he had keptpaid mistresses.</TEXT></DOC>
