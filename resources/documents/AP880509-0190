At one time Numero's ships chased salmon across the Pacific soonafter the harbor ice thawed in April. Now they lie in port, victimsof shrinking fish quotas in nearby waters, shortened fishingseasons and an off-limits zone around islands where many ofNumero's people were born _ all laid out by the Soviet Union.   The Japanese lost its Kuril Islands to the Soviets at the end ofWorld War II. In the late summer of 1945, Soviet troops arrived onthe southernmost of the islands and routed their 17,000 Japanesedwellers.   Nemuro, in northern Hokkaido, is just two miles from KurilIslands now occupied by Soviet troops, weapons and warplanes.   Nemuro's is caught in a chokehold, and its population of 39,000is in decline because of it.   ``This town is sinking economically,'' said Mayor Kaiji Ohya.``For more than 100 years, fishing has been our livelihood. Now wecan't fish near the islands we pioneered.   ``We want them back.''   Japan maintains the Soviet occupation of the Kurils is illegal.The Soviet Union, however, cites a wartime Allied pact giving itcontrol of all the Kurils. The dispute keeps the two countries fromsigning a formal World War II peace treaty.   But the worst part for Nemuro is that the harder Japan campaignsfor the islands' return, the tighter the Soviets draw the netaround Japanese fishing.   ``If we raise our voices, they take it out on us fishermen,''said Akimi Kubota, captain of a 90-ton ship.   Nowadays he has to steer his vessel past the islands where hewas born to waters south of the Soviet territorial line to fill his50-ton quota.   Thirty years ago, before the limits began to shrink, his shipcould take on 100 tons. The salmon and trout seasons then weretwice as long as the current three-month season, and the fishablewaters were closer to home.   Nemuro's pre-eminence in Japan's lucrative salmon market hasfaded, and businesses in Nemuro are going bankrupt at an increasingrate _ from four in 1977 to 25 eight years later.   ``If you squeeze the fishing industry, Nemuro becomesunlivable,'' Kubota said. ``There is that basic link. Half myfriends are gone. Many are still without work. It may be all rightto lose your job while you're young, but what do you do if you'realready getting old?''   Nemuro's people speak hopefully of the new course set out byMikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. His signing of the missiletreaty with President Reagan in December and the upcommingwithdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan have eased two majorobstacles to normalizing Japanese-Soviet relations.   ``This is a golden opportunity,'' said Professor Hiroshi Kimura,director of Hokkaido University's Slavic Research Center. ``Fishmust be sacrificed for the islands. Be patient three or four moreyears.''   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno of Japan has applauded Gorbachev'sactions.   One former islander is Sadao Nishida, a fisheries dealer whokeeps a rock in his hallway from Shikotan, the island he left as achild.   He remembers summers riding wild horses and swimming with themin clear, icy waters.   He was 10 years old on Sept. 1, 1945, two weeks after Japan lostthe war.   ``We never thought the Russians would come,'' he said. ``Japanlost to the Americans, after all.   ``That night we saw the lights of a ship. Was it American? Andthen around six in the morning we saw the red flag with the hammerand sickle.''   One-third of the island's people fled that day and eventually 60percent of the territories' 17,385 residents resettled in Nemuro.   Nishida said the Soviets permitted him to return to Shikotantwice to visit graves of relatives.   ``There wasn't a single house from the past,'' he said. ``Allthe buildings were Russian. And most of the Soviets were women.   ``They were such nice people. If you gave them something, theyabsolutely had to give you something in return.   ``I thought they might give back the islands.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs May 13</NOTE></DOC>
