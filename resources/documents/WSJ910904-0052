A group of researchers from Syracuse University reportedthey optically stored and retrieved data in three dimensionsin a tiny block made of molecules of the proteinbacteriorhodapsin. To date, information can be stored only intwo dimensions in the silicon chip.</LP><TEXT>   Separately, another group of scientists from Wayne StateUniversity in Detroit and the Max Planck Institute in Munichreported that they genetically manipulated the bacteria toproduce a mutated protein that's five times more sensitive tolight than the natural version, thus increasing theefficiency of the molecule as an optical memory device.   An emerging field, molecular electronics promises to pushelectronic computing beyond the fast approaching practicallimits of silicon chips. The biological molecule, whichnature has perfected to carry out a variety of complexfunctions in the living, offers a greater potential thansilicon chips for storing and processing data, researcherssay. They hope that molecular memory devices will helpdrastically shrink the size of computers and open up newpossibilities for creating &quot;associated memory&quot; devices thatwould function like the human brain in robotics and computervision.   In the last ten years, researchers have been testing avariety of organic and synthetic molecules as a storagedevice. But bacteriorhodapsin, is turning out to be themolecule of choice because of its high speed and efficiencyin converting light into chemical and electrical signals,said Robert Birge, who's leading the research at Syracuse.The molecule changes its shape back and forth when hit with alaser beam, and the original and the new shape act as on-off,or zero-one, sequences; the building blocks of computermemory.   Mr. Birge, who presented papers on his research at aninternational symposium of the Chemical Congress of NorthAmerica in New York last week, said one virtue of thebacteriorhodapsin molecule is its ability to capture twophotons simultaneously, more effectively than any otherorganic or inorganic molecule he has tested. A photon is thesmallest packet of light that can be created. It's thisability to capture two photons simultaneously that allowsinformation to be stored three dimensionally.   Mr. Birge said his group recently fashioned aone-centimeter cube made of the protein molecules anddemonstrated its ability to store data in three dimensions.&quot;Six of these cubes can store the entire Library ofCongress,&quot; he said, and added that research at Syracuse andelsewhere on the use of the protein in molecular electronicshave &quot;now verified the promises the field made five yearsago.&quot; Before that, &quot;Three dimensional storage existed only inour wildest imaginations,&quot; he said.   The genetic engineering of modified bacteriorhodapsin alsohas made the protein suitable for storing holographic images,said Nordert Hampp, who is working on its applications at theMax Planck Institute. The modified protein can storethree-dimensional images five times faster than does thenatural version. The higher speed is essential to storingsuch images, he said.   With the ability to store three-dimensional images, theprotein can be employed as a memory device capable ofcomparing and analyzing characters and pictures. In thesilicon chip's digital system, a computer requires enormouscapacity and speed to recognize objects. But in the opticalsystem, a computer with three-dimensional images in itsmemory bank would simply look for certain crucialsimilarities to identify an object. &quot;If you have a complexpicture, the optical computer doesn't require any complexcomputing,&quot; said Mr. Hampp.   The protein has an additional advantage, &quot;With thisprotein, you can record and erase and take another picture,&quot;he said.   Bacteriorhodapsin, which was first isolated about 20 yearsago, is similar to the protein on the retina of the eye andreacts to light in a similar way: It converts light energyinto chemical energy, which an optical memory device requiresto store information. But unlike the protein in the eye, theprotein in the bacteria found in salt marsh can withstandextreme heat and a corrosive environment.   Computers and robots endowed with artificial vision usingthis protein as a memory bank, however, are still many yearsaway. &quot;Robert Birge is close to developing a realisticdevice, but a lot more work needs to be done before we'll seeany commercial products,&quot; said Paul Saia, who is familiarwith advances in molecular electronics, and is an assessor oftechnology at Digital Equipment Corp., a maker of computersand communications hardware based in Maynard, Mass.   &quot;I have been tracking developments in molecularelectronics for the last five years, and we are beginning tosee some exciting things and an excellent collaborativeeffort on an international scale,&quot; Mr. Saia said.</TEXT></DOC>
