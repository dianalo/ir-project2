The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said that although the townof Novy Uzen was quiet on Wednesday, its airport ``is packed withfamilies'' trying to flee.   Pravda also said the disturbances had spread to settlements about40 miles away in the Kazakhstan republic. About 500 peopledemonstrated in Zhetibai and two people were hurt in Munaishi, thenewspaper said.   It said ethnic Kazakhs in Novy Uzen demanded Sunday that allmembers of Caucasus ethnic groups be evicted within a week. Morethan one-third of Novy Uzen's 56,000 residents are from the Caucasus.   ``The demand was accompanied by threats,'' Pravda said withoutelaborating.   The government newspaper Izvestia called the demand``anti-constitutional'' and said it could not be met.   The violence began Friday during a fight at a dance, and morethan 50 police officers and soldiers were injured in rioting overthe next four days.   Hundreds of Interior Ministry soldiers were sent to the town andauthorites imposed a 9 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew.   Officials on Thursday tightened their control over Novy Uzen'swater, sewer and electrical systems, as well as food stores and abread factory _ all targets of rioters who want to ``be able todictate their own conditions to the authorities,'' Izvestia said.   Ethnic Kazakhs say the Caucasus settlers dominate the oilindustry jobs on which the town depends and receive preferentialtreatment in housing and other benefits.   The settlers also have set up private businesses that sellsupplies in the isolated desert town for exorbitant prices, Izvestiasaid.   Corrupt party and government workers in Novy Uzen alsocontributed to widespread discontent by ``getting involved in dirtydeals,'' the official news agency Tass quoted top Kazakhstanofficials as saying.   In Alma Ata, the republic's capital, an ethnic Kazakh was namedthe region's new party chief to replace Gennady Kolbin, an ethnicRussian. He left the post to become chairman of the People's ControlCommittee, which monitors government ministries, Tass reported.   The appointment of Kolbin as party chief in 1986 touched offwidespread rioting in Alma Ata that left hundreds injured and atleast two dead.   The new party chief, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been premier ofKazakhstan since 1984. The 49-year-old Nazarbayev was the firstSoviet official to admit the 1986 unrest was ethnically motivatedand not hooliganism as press reports claimed.   The former metal worker backs greater economic independence forthe republic of more than 16 million, Tass said.   The unrest in Novy Uzen was the third outbreak of ethnic riotingin Soviet Central Asia in the past six weeks.   In the worst of the violence, native Uzbeks attacked the MeskhiTurk minority in the Fergana Valley of eastern Uzbekistan and about100 people were killed. Most of the victims were Meskhi Turks, whowere forcibly resettled in the valley in 1944 by the late dictatorJosef Stalin.   The Fergana region has quieted down, and police there have beendetaining people for ``inciting unlawful actions,'' Tass saidThursday.</TEXT></DOC>
