The Nicaraguan statement said two American-made F-5 jets stageda 10-minute attack Saturday afternoon in the Bocay area about 65miles northeast of Managua, dropping four bombs against Sandinistaarmy positions but causing no damages.   The ministry said that two F-5 warplanes flew over Sandinistapositions Saturday morning in the frontier sectors of Mukuwas, SanAndres de Bocay, Waniwas and Wayawas, producing no damage.   The Defense Ministry said the area of the Saturday's attack wasthe same where Honduran jets dropped several bombs on Thursday.   There was no comment from the Honduran government on theNicaraguan report. Honduras has several thousand soldiers in theBocay border area under orders to drive out any Nicaraguan troopsthey find in Honduran territory.   The Bocay zone is where Honduras said Sandinista troops invadedHonduran territory last week to attack bases of U.S.-backedNicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.   Honduran armed forces officials had said earlier Saturday thatthe Nicaraguans were withdrawing.   President Daniel Ortega, speaking Saturday before his governmentreported the Honduran air raids, said he would ask theInternational Court of Justice for an injunction preventingmilitary activities that could ``raise tension'' between Hondurasand Nicaragua.   The move appeared designed to step up political pressure on theUnited States, which last week sent 3,200 American troops toneighboring Honduras as a warning to Nicaragua.   The tribunal at The Hague, Netherlands, also known as the WorldCourt, has no power unless both sides of a dispute agree to itsjurisdiction.   Ortega made his announcement in a talk show appearance ongovernment television during which he accused neighboring Hondurasof ``being an accomplice in the criminal activities'' of Contrarebels against his regime.   While he did not name the United States in his announcement,Ortega appeared to be referring to the dispatch of American troopsto Honduras.   Ortega asked the court to issue an injunction calling forunspecified ``interim measures of protection'' against any militaryactivities ``that could raise tension even more between Hondurasand Nicaragua.''   In Washington, Reagan administration officials said the dispatchof troops to Honduras was in response to an appeal for help by thatcountry's president, Jose Azcona Hoyo.   Azcona claims Sandinista troops are still inside Honduranterritory. But the Sandinistas say they are on their own side ofthe border chasing U.S.-supported Contra rebels.   Ortega said his appeal was part of a lawsuit that Nicaraguafiled several months ago with the World Court, demanding that itcondemn Honduras for allowing rebels to use its territory to mountcross-border attacks.   Honduras and the Contras claim the rebel camps are on theNicaraguan side of the ill-defined, sparsely populated border. TheSandinistas contend the camps are inside Honduras.   Nicaragua's civil war has taken more than 40,000 lives sinceNovember 1981, when the Contras began fighting the Sandinistagovernment.</TEXT></DOC>
