While oil is plentiful and relatively cheap, we should devote our creative energies to the long-term development of alternative energy resources. Unfortunately our country and most others already have forgotten the lessons from the oil embargoes -- that the world's oil supply can be manipulated by a few and is ultimately finite.    As you noted, the Japanese attitude toward energy development &quot;is that Randamp;D has a long lead time and that we can't be swayed by the short-term energy situation.&quot; Government agencies work with private industry, spend billions of yen and take a lot of the risk in securing the future. In the U.S., however, there seems to be an antagonistic relationship between government and industry in which neither side wants to spend money or take risks. We have removed most of the tax incentives for the renewable energy industry, killed off our synfuels program, and allowed erratic regulations to cripple our coal and nuclear-energy capabilities.    If another energy crisis comes, the Japanese, as one businessman said, &quot;will have the best know-how in the world.&quot; Will we have to buy that from them, too?    Lynn E. Weaver   Dean of Engineering   Auburn University   Auburn, Ala.   ---   Your article is useful in evaluating and understanding Japan's concerns about future energy supply. But the likely implications or inferences for the U.S. could be misleading because the story does not start far enough back.    When I first entered the alternative energy sources business 50 years ago, nearly all the sources identified in your article already were under consideration. During the next 25 years I evaluated the economic potential not only of 80% to 90% of the dozen sources mentioned, but of another dozen or so as well. With proper allowance for more technical information and changes in raw material recovery costs and labor cost (i.e., general inflation), these projections are still useful for basic guidance.    But private industry's contribution -- only alluded to in your article -- is of primary importance in the U.S. Government support has come into the picture only in the past 25 years, and then only to repeat much of the work private industry already had covered. In fact, the political aspects of government have done far more harm than the dollar support has done good in the energy field. When long-range planning is permitted by government, including the removal of bias against large private activities, private industry will move alternative sources into operation based on, and the time schedule of, what gives the most economic results.
