All told, according to the filings, six executives anddirectors of the Watertown, Mass., manufacturer ofmedical-alert devices trimmed their holdings by 58,666shares. That is equivalent to 87,999 shares adjusted for athree-for-two stock split of July 15.</LP><TEXT>   Four of the insiders sold all of their stock, althougheach of them continues to hold options to purchase additionalshares.   Roughly half of the insider sales involved sharespurchased with options within the past nine months.Option-related sales are usually considered less significantas an indicator of insider sentiment by those who trackinsider-trading patterns. The SEC filings show that some ofthe insiders could have exercised their options and sold thestock at a profit as early as 18 months ago.   Lifeline sells and leases small radio transmitters andrelated monitoring equipment designed to aid people who needurgent medical attention but who can't get to a telephone.The stock has been a Wall Street success story, rising 34% inthe year to date and 387% in 1990.   The insiders sold their shares at split-adjusted prices of$13.43 to $16.58 a share, for a total of about $1.3 million,SEC filings show. Since last Thursday, the stock's price haseased 11% following news that second-quarter earnings were 15cents a share compared with 16 cents in the yearearlierquarter. In over-the-counter trading, Lifeline shares closedyesterday at $16.375, up 37.5 cents.   Kathleen Barry, the company's chief financial officer,said the insiders sold because they consider the stock ascompensation. She also said the stock price has fallenrecently because investors misunderstood the company'searnings release, not because of lessened prospects.&quot;Earnings appeared flat&quot; because the 1990 quarter's resultswere inflated by six cents a share from one-time items, suchas the sale of leased equipment, she said.   Ms. Barry said the company is branching out and will soonoffer systems that alert relatives or neighbors, designed tobe used by the elderly and by children.   Nicholas Pantazis, analyst at Monness, Crespi andamp; Hardt, aNew York investment firm, said the company has Lifeline stockin several of its investment accounts but that some of itsclients have &quot;scaled out&quot; of the stock. &quot;It's a goodlong-term story, and demographics are favoring the company,but it's valued pretty dearly in the market. There comes apoint where you say, `thank you,' and look at it later.&quot;   ---   BANKING ON FIRSTIER: Last week, when bank stocks ralliedon merger news, the largest stock purchase by a bank insiderreported to the SEC was Charles F.
