L.P. will report highersecond-quarter earnings, thanks to the recent rise in demandfor lumber, plywood and raw products, Rick R. Holley, vicepresident and chief financial officer, said.   Mr. Holley said earnings were about $4 million, or 25cents a unit, compared with $3.3 million, or 21 cents a unit,a year earlier. Revenue rose to about $100 million from $83million. The forest-products limited partnership expects toreport its second-quarter results tomorrow.</LP><TEXT>   The estimated earnings exceeded analysts expectations ofbetween break even and 10 cents a unit. The company reporteda net loss of $3.3 million, or 25 cents per unit, for thefirst quarter, reflecting a general industry downturn. Demandand prices for logs, lumber and plywood were all downcompared to the year-earlier first quarter, when the companyposted a profit of $13 million, or 81 cents a unit.   Demand picked up during this year's second quarter,boosting prices for logs, lumber and plywood between 6% and12% from the previous quarter, Mr. Holley said in aninterview. About 70% of the company's business is providinglumber and plywood for the repair and remodeling industry,while much of the rest is exporting logs to Japan.   At the same time that demand began picking up, Mr. Holleysaid, there was little product available. Since Plum Creekhad its plants running at capacity, he said, the company wasable to capitalize on the fresh demand. Other competitors, hesaid, had scaled back or closed mills during the slowdown,leaving Plum Creek in a better competitive position.   Cornelius Sewell, an analyst at Argus Research Corp., saidPlum Creek enjoyed a good second quarter because it was soheavily concentrated in lumber and plywood. Mr. Sewell saidmost other forestproduct firms specialize in paper and thatmany experienced a sluggish quarter because of continuedsoftness in the paper markets.   Mr. Holley said Plum Creek expects the third quarter to beeven stronger than the second, because both demand andproduction typically peak during the third period. For theyear, he estimated net income at 50 cents to 75 cents a unitcompared with $1.33 a unit in 1990.   Plum Creek was spun off in 1989 from Burlington ResourcesInc., a Seattle-based energy and natural resources concern.Plum Creek owns about 1.4 million acres of timber land in thePacific Northwest.</TEXT></DOC>
