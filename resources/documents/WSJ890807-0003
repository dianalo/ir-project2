The legislation, agrees Dennis Jacobe, the director of research for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, &quot;will bring the most dramatic change since the 1930s. There is no doubt about it.&quot;    The huge cost is shockingly clear: Regulators will spend at least $166 billion to close or sell hundreds of insolvent savings institutions over the next decade. What is less obvious is the way the legislation will largely dismantle the $1.2 trillion thrift industry, not just by speeding the disappearance of about 750 dead or dying Sandamp;Ls, but also by freeing commercial banks, for the first time, to buy healthy thrifts. In addition, it will permit healthy savings institutions choosing to remain independent to convert themselves into banks.    However, the legislation will severely damage about 1,500 marginally profitable thrifts, which can't readily afford some of its financial penalties and restrictions nor the fiercer competition for market share. In the next several years, experts estimate, 1,000 to 2,000 thrift institutions will sell out or fail, and the industry's assets will shrink by as much as $250 billion.    Other big losers will include depositors and mortgage borrowers who won't find the many bargains once offered by desperate thrift lenders. The real-estate industry, already battered by the deflation of the 1980s, will feel continuing downward pressure on prices as regulators unload tens of billions of dollars worth of repossessed real estate. Another possible victim is the thrift-rescue effort itself. As the industry shrinks, the deposit-insurance funds will receive less and less premium money and may be less able to cope with accelerating losses at some thrifts.    The big winners will be the commercial banks and money-market funds, which will get a flood of savings diverted from the shrinking thrift industry, and the shareholders of many healthy Sandamp;Ls, who are expected to receive premiums of 100% or more on their shares, above current market prices, from acquirers. Even if not sold, many of the top 750 Sandamp;Ls will probably reap a profit bonanza from a marked drop in their cost of funds as the irksome competition from insolvent thrifts wanes.    &quot;There is a massive restructuring to take place under this law,&quot; says Sen. Donald Riegle, the Michigan Democrat who, as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, helped steer the bill to adoption.    The sweeping and sometimes harsh nature of many of the thrift legislation's provisions surprised the financial community. The 1,000-page law is loaded with dozens of changes so extreme that they once would have outraged the industry and provoked warfare among lobbyists on Capitol Hill.    But in one fell swoop, banks were authorized not only to buy thrifts immediately but to meld them into their branch networks if they so desire. Sandamp;Ls are required to have tangible capital -- the excess of real assets over liabilities -- equal to 1.5% of their assets immediately and reach 3% by the end of 1994; a total of 672 thrifts don't meet the 1.5% standard now, and more than 300 more currently don't meet the 1994 standard. The premiums paid by banks into their federal deposit-insurance fund will be almost doubled, to $1.50 for every $1,000 of deposits, but the thrifts' premiums will rise to $2.30 next year and could ultimately reach $3.25.    Under the new law, they must keep nearly 70% of their assets in mortgage-related investments, compared with almost-unlimited investment powers for many thrifts previously, and separate capital requirements will make it difficult for them to continue direct investment in real estate and other high-risk endeavors. They can convert to a less-restrictive bank charter but won't be able to escape the higher insurance premiums for at least five years. Their $1.8 billion of retained earnings in the Federal Home Loan Banks, which they own, was expropriated; so was much of the $1.2 billion of dividends paid them out of the FHLBs' annual earnings. The funds will repay borrowings that finance the closing of insolvent thrifts and also subsidize low-income housing.    For the weaker Sandamp;Ls, the thrift bill is in many ways a legislated replay of the Depression, which wiped out 10,000 mostly tiny banks and sparked an era of strict regulation of depository institutions. The bill reintroduces strict regulation of Sandamp;Ls and is expected to encourage or finance the demise of hundreds of thrifts, which generally are much larger than the Depression's victims.    Among the first to go will be the 250 insolvent thrifts held in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s conservatorship program, whose operating losses are growing the fastest. Since President Bush unveiled the bill in February and the FDIC took charge of the insolvent Sandamp;Ls, its greatest disappointment has been its inability to bring down the high interest rates those institutions pay. The &quot;Texas premium&quot; -- industry jargon for the premium interest rates that insolvent Sandamp;Ls generally pay to attract deposits, to the detriment of solvent institutions -- has risen to more than one percentage point in the past year.    &quot;We're going to be looking first at institutions that have a high cost of funding,&quot; apart from loan write-offs, says Roger Watson, the FDIC's research director.    Based on that, thrifts likely to be sold or merged in the first wave include Southwest Savings, a Dallas thrift that was supposedly rescued in a regulatory merger last year but is currently running net interest losses at a rate of $227 million a year, according to an analysis by Veribanc Inc., a Woburn, Mass., bank research firm. Southwest Savings isn't officially in the conservatorship program because of its previous &quot;rescue.&quot; Other big bleeders include University Savings, of Houston; San Jacinto Savings of Bellaire, Texas, and Commonwealth Savings, of Houston. Most of the Sandamp;Ls in the program either made bad real-estate investments or were dragged down by the energy-belt depression.    The next most vulnerable are the 300 or so insolvent Sandamp;Ls not yet in conservatorship. Some also made reckless or ill-fated real-estate bets, but many are refugees from the interest-rate squeeze of the early 1980s, when inflation drove their deposit costs far above their investment yields. Some of the biggest were created by regulatory mergers, in which the regulators allowed them to count the unrecognized losses in their loan portfolios as &quot;good will.&quot; This often-fictional capital, which the government relied on as a tool to keep ailing thrifts from collapsing, has been disallowed by the new legislation, which requires that good will to be stricken from the books over a five-year period.    The impact of all this is clearly illustrated at Empire of America, a Buffalo, N.Y., thrift with $11.6 billion of assets, including $750 million of regulatory good will. Empire was created out of the merger of 13 insolvent Sandamp;Ls. Its liabilities exceed its real assets by about $600 million, but it has been able to claim solvency by reporting the $750 million of good will as capital. Partly because this capital doesn't generate any earnings, Empire was inundated by red ink. Trying to restructure, it is seeking $900 million from regulators plus $720 million of debt and equity to be raised by Drexel Burnham Lambert.    &quot;We think we have a proposal that is less expensive than any alternative,&quot; says Paul Willax, Empire's chairman. If the FDIC doesn't go along, Mr. Willax says, a sale of Empire by the FDIC to an outside acquirer would be more expensive. And he estimates that a straight liquidation of Empire would cost $1.5 billion.    These two groups of thrifts will just about exhaust the $50 billion to be raised through bond offerings under the legislation. In addition, the bill provides about $40 billion, to be raised through higher deposit-insurance premiums, the sale of repossessed real estate and other means, that will be used to pay the continuing costs of closing 223 thrifts in 1988.    The FDIC, through a new entity called the Resolution Trust Corp., will generally use the $50 billion for cash infusions that will bring the insolvent Sandamp;Ls' tangible capital up to about zero. Then, the regulators will hunt for investors willing to provide enough additional capital to meet the new regulatory requirements. Such deals won't halt or even reduce the losses being incurred by the insolvent institutions, as is commonly believed; they will simply pay the already-incurred costs.    In contrast to 1988, investors aren't likely to be offered &quot;yield-maintenance&quot; agreements, under which they were guaranteed a high return for keeping bad assets on the books as long as 10 years, the FDIC says. Nor will they be given the lucrative tax breaks handed out last year; Congress, in a fit of outrage, banned them. &quot;It's going to be pretty much cash only,&quot; the FDIC's Mr. Watson says.    But the FDIC will still probably have to protect investors against any as-yet-unrecognized losses in the insolvent thrifts' loan portfolios or other assets, as the FSLIC did. If the restructured Sandamp;Ls still lose money despite the FDIC's assistance, the investors will lose their investment and the agency will have to take the institutions over again, infusing more cash.    It isn't clear how much corporate investors will be enticed by the less lucrative terms. If the FDIC succeeds, it could indicate that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. may have acted hastily last year in giving investors tax breaks and yield-maintenance agreements.    Publicly offered limited partnerships giving individual investors the chance to get in on the action have been formed by or sold through Salomon Bros., Shearson Lehman Hutton, Oppenheimer andamp; Co. and Merrill Lynch. The American First fund, sold through Shearson, last year acquired Eureka Federal, a $1.7 billion institution in San Carlos, Calif., in a largely cash deal. Oppenheimer has a small $30 million fund to look at small assisted deals.    &quot;There is an almost limitless amount of interest,&quot; asserts Gerard Smith, an official of the Salomon fund.    A further $24 billion is supposed to be raised though the higher premiums and other means after the third year of the legislation's passage, through the 10th year, to handle additional insolvencies.    However, the bill may actually hasten those future collapses. The 1,500 Sandamp;Ls with marginal or average earnings will have a hard time paying the extra deposit-insurance premiums while simultaneously suffering the expropriation of most of their FHLB dividends. Such dividends accounted for a third of the solvent thrifts' $3.5 billion of net income last year. At the same time, some institutions can't meet the new capital requirements and aren't strong enough to attract outside capital. Without adequate capital, they won't be allowed to &quot;grow&quot; profits by adding assets.    Only now are once-sleepy mutual Sandamp;Ls across the country awakening to the challenge of raising capital to levels that will satisfy the regulators. Ronald Riggins, a Washington Sandamp;L consultant, says his small business has increased by 50% in the past month. He is conducting presentations for mutual Sandamp;Ls that must convert to stock institutions to raise capital. &quot;Our clients are stunned as we go through the evaluation of the capital requirements, and what it means to them,&quot; he says.    Many weak, undercapitalized Sandamp;Ls won't be able to sell stock or find merger partners, and their only recourse will be to shrink. Money-losing CenTrust Bank, of Miami, agreed last month to sell 63 branches with $2.4 billion of deposits to Great Western Bank, of Beverly Hills, Calif., for $150 million. The proceeds will be used to bolster CenTrust's tangible capital from a negative $42 million to a positive $79 million. Homestead Savings, a San Francisco lender, has sold $2 billion of assets, mostly mortgage-backed securities, since the start of the year. The move caused a $14 million loss but raised tangible capital to 2.35%.    &quot;Shrinkage will be the mode for a number of institutions,&quot; says John Atherton, the chief executive of City Federal Savings, of Bedminster, N.J. The unprofitable thrift has tangible capital equal to less than 1% of assets. It plans to reduce its assets by nearly $1.5 billion in the second half, mostly by selling mortgage-backed securities. The recent drop in long-term rates has increased the value of such securities by about $100 million for each $1 billion held, a godsend to ailing Sandamp;Ls.    Many industry officials question the long-term viability of the shrinkage strategy, however. They say weak Sandamp;Ls would tend to sell their best assets and keep the worst, because selling bad assets would force them to recognize losses that they can't bear. CenTrust, for instance, is selling a branch system that generated low-cost funds, and must now depend largely on the volatile high-cost money markets to finance its assets.    &quot;Congress has developed a very hostile environment for a very significant portion of the industry,&quot; says Mr. Willax, Empire's chairman. &quot;It's going to cost the taxpayers a lot of money.&quot; Adds Herbert Sandler, the chairman of Golden West Financial Corp., a big California thrift holding company: &quot;The very large taking from the FHLBs, and the very large insurance premium, defeat the ability of middling institutions to build up capital.&quot;    But Mr. Sandler's main problem is likely to be fending off unwanted suitors. His thrift unit, World Savings, is among the top 25% of the industry that has been able to generate robust profits, mostly by keeping costs low and dominating healthy mortgage markets. Such thrifts can afford to lose their FHLB dividends and pay higher insurance premiums. Commercial banks are eager to acquire such Sandamp;Ls, and even mediocre earners that have large branch networks with low-cost retail deposits, because it is the opportunity of a lifetime to buy market share cheaply. Here's why:    Banks have to pay the equivalent of eight to 20 cents for each dollar of deposits when they buy individual bank branches, an expensive way to acquire market share. But thrift stocks are cheap -- often 50% below the price/earnings multiple of bank stocks. So, banks could acquire Sandamp;Ls for the equivalent of 4.5 cents per dollar of deposit, a price that would still be 60% to 100% above many thrifts' current stock prices, according to an analysis by Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., a New York securities firm.    For instance, GlenFed Inc., the giant California thrift-holding company, is currently selling at $20.75 a share. A price equal to 4.5% of its deposits would be $36.50 a share, or 76% above the current price. Shareholders of TCF Financial, which has one out of every four Minnesotan adults for customers, would receive a 60% premium if an acquirer offered 4.5% of deposits.    &quot;It just doesn't cost that much to take down one of these thrifts,&quot; says Donald Crowley, a Keefe analyst. Indeed, the seven biggest candidates on Keefe's list, with assets totaling $105 billion, could be acquired for a 100% premium and the price still would be a relatively modest $4.4 billion. The market value of a single strong bank, Security Pacific Corp. of Los Angeles, is $5.8 billion.    That's powerful arithmetic, compounded by the fact that the banks can probably eliminate the differential that even healthy thrifts, compared with banks, have been paying on deposits. The biggest Sandamp;Ls now pay about 85 basis points (a basis point is one-hundreth of a percentage point) more on six-month certificates than the biggest banks do, according to a survey by Sheshunoff andamp; Co., a research firm in Austin, Texas. Since even highly profitable Sandamp;Ls' net income is 75 to 100 basis points or so as a percentage of assets, that much of a differential severely damages earnings. If acquiring banks eliminate the differential, as expected, the target thrifts' core earnings could jump 50% or more.    So, commercial banks are out hunting. Wells Fargo andamp; Co., which has been trying to expand into the Southern California market, is believed to be interested in both GlenFed and Great American First, which have big shares there. Before the moratorium on thrift conversions two years ago, Comerica Inc., a Michigan bank, had bought a $200 million Grand Rapids, Mich., thrift and had converted it to a bank. Now, Comerica is looking for more.    &quot;A savings and loan is an interesting vehicle to get you into a market,&quot; says J. Michael Fulton, the bank's senior vice president for corporate development. Comerica's trust operations in Florida, for example, may make that state a logical target, he adds. &quot;We've hired our advisers, we have candidates' names, and we're making calls,&quot; he says.    But the banks in certain markets will have to move fast or be prepared to make hostile bids. Big thrifts are thinking about merging with each other within their states, increasing earnings by paring overlapping operations. GlenFed, for instance, recently held merger talks with another Los Angeles giant, CalFed Inc., but the two couldn't agree on terms. They may try again. Moreover, the healthy thrifts think that they can signficantly reduce the deposit differential without being acquired by banks, thus boosting their earnings and stocks. Some deem their prospects so good that their shareholders would be better off spurning a bank's offer.    Mr. Sandler, for instance, says his big California thrift isn't for sale. So does William Cooper, TCF's chief executive. &quot;In my humble opinion, we can do better over a period of time on our own,&quot; Mr. Cooper says.    Healthy Sandamp;Ls can't lose, concludes Alex Sheshunoff, who heads Sheshunoff andamp; Co. &quot;The legislation is very positive for healthy thrifts in three major ways,&quot; he says. &quot;It brings stability and respectability back to the industry, it improves earnings because rational competitors will be paying rational deposit rates and, most importantly, it will end up maximizing shareholder value as a result of healthy banks buying healthy thrifts.&quot;    ---@ Some Large Potential Acquisition Candidates @ MARKET @ ASSETS VALUE @ NAME (millions)* (millions)** @ CalFed, Los Angeles $28,346 $621 @ GlenFed, Glendale, Calif. 25,626 611 @ Great American, San Diego 16,497 254 @ Coast, Los Angeles 12,829 231 @ First Fed, Detroit 11,942 175 @ TCF Financial, Minneapolis 5,319 113 @ SFFED, San Francisco 4,494 147 @ *As of June 30, 1989 @ **Based on Friday's closing prices @ Source: Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods, Inc., New York @ --- @ Insolvent Sandamp;Ls Most Likely to Lead Liquidation March @ ANNUAL @ OP.
