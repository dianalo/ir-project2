SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan, as promised, today vetoedlegislation tightening curbs on textile, apparel and shoe imports.He said the bill would have ``disastrous effects'' on the U.S.economy.   Reagan's action set the stage for a congressional override votenext week. One prime backer estimated he was within eight votes ofthe two-thirds majority needed to overrule the president.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan vetoed thebill as soon as it arrived from Capitol Hill.   ``We vetoed it as soon as we got it,'' Fitzwater said.   The bill, intended to protect American industries againstforeign competition, won final congressional approval last Friday,but without a two-thirds margin.   Reagan, in a statement released by the White House, charged thatthe measure ``would have disastrous effects on the U.S. economy.   ``It would impose needles costs on American consumers, threatenjobs in our export industries, jeopardize our overseas farm sales,and undermine our efforts to obtain a more open trading system forU.S. exports. president said.   ``This bill represents protectionism at its worst. At a timewhen American exports are booming, the United States must notembark on a course that would diminish our trade opportunities.''   Asked about possible repercussions of the veto on Vice PresidentGeorge Bush's election effort in the South, where even some staunchRepublicans had backed the bill, Fitzwater replied, ``It's ourbelief that, politics aside, ... protectionism is the issue here.''   But a chief Senate sponsor of the bill, Ernest F. Hollings,D-S.C., issued a statement saying, ``We gave President Reaganexactly what he asked for.''   ``Seven years ago, the European Community globalized its quotasand President Reagan recommended we globalize our quotas. We didwhat the president wanted. This is political demagoguery at itsworst.''   The bill would:   _Freeze textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels this year andlimit growth to 1 percent annually starting in January.   _Freeze imports of non-rubber footwear with no provision forincreases.   _Impose import quotas on 180 categories of textile products and30 types of footwear, a system that would be reviewed after 10years.   _Set up a one-year program under which the government wouldauctioned off import licenses and set a special quota for silkneckties.   Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., said he hoped to vote on the vetoTuesday. ``We figure we're about seven or eight votes off right nowand we hope to wangle those by then,'' he added.   ``I expected the veto,'' Derrick said. ``Reagan is misguidedwhen it comes to his idea of protectionism. He thinks there's sucha thing as free trade and there is no such thing as free trade inthe world.''   Fitzwater said he was confident the veto would not be overridden.   The House approved the bill on a vote of 248-150 on Friday.Earlier this month, the Senate approved the measure 59-36.</TEXT><TEXT>   The textile and apparel industries, along with a number ofunions and their congressional allies, had called the bill vital tohalting job losses of more than 400,000 in those industries,hammered by a surge of foreign-made goods early in the decade.Worse, they say, those imports are still flooding American markets.   Those claims are dismissed by critics, who point to burgeoningearnings in the textile industry this year brought on by automationand greater efficiency in the plants.   The critics, including retailers and businesses fearing newcurbs would trigger retaliation against their exports, say theincrease in efficiency and automation were the result of theincreased competition. Protectionism, the critics argue, would dullthe American competitive response.   Also today, Reagan signed legislation implementing theU.S.-Canadian free trade agreement, saying it will mean lowerprices for consumers and many new jobs for workers.   The action clears the way for the United States to phase outtariffs on $131 billion in merchandise that crosses the U.S.-Canadaborder each year. Leaders of the Canadian Senate, however, havesaid the chamber will delay action on the agreement until PrimeMinister Brian Mulroney calls an election, which could come inNovember.</TEXT></DOC>
