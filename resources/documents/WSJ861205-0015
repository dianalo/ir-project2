Boesky amassed stock positions in advance of significant news announcements.    An analysis of the transactions under scrutiny also suggests that instead of limiting its investigation to traditional insider trading, the government is conducting a broad inquiry into takeover tactics. Others involved in the dealings include some of America's best-known corporate raiders: T. Boone Pickens, Carl Icahn, Victor Posner and Saul Steinberg -- all Drexel clients.    In its inquiry, the SEC has looked at transactions involving 14 takeover-related stocks. The 14 stocks were apparently involved in a total of nine corporate dealings. Lawyers familiar with the investigation say there's no evidence that Dennis B. Levine, who implicated Mr. Boesky in other instances of insider trading, was a source for Mr. Boesky in these deals. The SEC is also known to be investigating other transactions that haven't yet been identified and could involve firms other than Drexel. As a result, examining the nine known transactions provides only a glimpse at the SEC's continuing investigation.    The 14 stocks were named by the SEC in subpoenas issued in connection with its inquiry. They are Diamond Shamrock, Fischbach, Gulf andamp; Western, Harris Graphics, Lorimar, Lorimar-Telepictures, MGM/UA Entertainment, Occidental Petroleum, Pacific Lumber, Phillips Petroleum, Trans World, United Artists, Unocal and Wickes.    Seven of the nine transactions involved takeover bids or asset sales. Drexel represented the initiator of those bids in all but one case, and in that case Drexel officials were investors in the target company and helped initiate the takeover bid. One transaction involved merger negotiations that were broken off. Drexel issued an advisory opinion for the suitor in those talks. In a ninth situation, Drexel represented a company rumored to be making a bid and later represented another company that publicly threatened a bid.    These facts emerge from an examination of documents, from transactions known to figure in the SEC's investigation and from scores of interviews with participants in the deals. The facts could be coincidence. Drexel and some of its officials, including Michael Milken, who heads the operation that finances takeovers using high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds, have been subpoenaed. But that doesn't mean that Drexel or any of its officials are suspected of wrongdoing.    It is also possible that government investigators have already discarded some of the nine transactions, having concluded that there isn't any evidence of wrongdoing.    Asked to comment, a Drexel spokesman said: &quot;It is hardly news that Drexel Burnham had an investment banking relationship with the particular companies you have chosen to focus on. It's also well understood that Mr. Boesky took positions in most large merger transactions, and that some of these were Drexel clients would not be surprising. Apart from Dennis Levine, who stole information and sold it to Mr. Boesky, we know of no one at Drexel Burnham who provided inside information to Mr. Boesky. We in no way would condone any violation of the securities laws.&quot;    Still, the subpoenas that identified the nine transactions were issued shortly after the SEC's announcement Nov. 14 that Mr. Boesky had settled insider-trading charges. Mr. Boesky agreed to pay a record $100 million penalty, plead guilty to a felony and cooperate with the government. While it isn't known what Mr. Boesky has confessed to investigators, similar patterns emerge in many of these transactions.    For example, Mr. Boesky amassed stock positions in advance of public announcements of market significance in all nine instances. According to SEC filings, he began buying Fischbach stock in late April 1984. In July 1984, a company controlled by Mr. Posner first indicated publicly that it would seek more than 50% of Fischbach's shares.    Mr. Boesky began buying stock in Pacific Lumber on Sept. 27, 1985; three days later, Maxxam, a Drexel client, said that it would begin a tender offer for the company. Mr. Boesky disclosed that he owned a large stake in Harris Graphics on Oct. 1, 1985. An offer to buy Harris by AM International was announced in April 1986. Mr. Boesky's Pacific Lumber and Harris purchases were disclosed in SEC filings.    Moreover, according to officials in the companies or securities firms involved, Mr. Boesky:    --Owned a large stock position in Phillips Petroleum prior to a takeover bid by Mr. Icahn.    --Held a large Unocal stake prior to Mesa's public tender offer.    --And began acquiring a large stock position in Gulf andamp; Western prior to a June 1985 announcement that Wickes would pay $1 billion for Gulf andamp; Western's consumer-products division, which caused Gulf andamp; Western's stock to rise sharply.    Mr. Boesky also amassed positions in two stocks that were targets of bids that never materialized, Diamond Shamrock and Trans World, according to participants in negotiations and officials of the companies. Occidental Petroleum sought unsuccessfully to acquire Diamond Shamrock in January 1985, and Mr. Boesky identified himself as the owner of a stake in phone calls to participants seeking information about progress in the talks.    And at some time during the past six months, Mr. Boesky told Trans World that he held a large block of its stock, according to officials close to Trans World. They say that Mr. Boesky appears to have acquired Trans World stock about the time that the company heard rumors that it was the target of a takeover bid by Golden Nugget. No such bid ever materialized, but Trans World shares rose sharply on the rumors in October 1985. Golden Nugget later disclosed in SEC filings that as of the end of 1985, it held close to 5% of Trans World's stock. Eventually, Trans World became the target of Revlon.    Mr. Boesky won't comment on these investments, and whether he acted on the basis of inside information can't be determined. The timing of his purchases may have been luck, or there may be other explanations. His lawyer, Harvey Pitt, cautions that while he can't comment on any specific stock purchases by Mr. Boesky, &quot;it would be a mistake to extrapolate from his settlement with the SEC that trading in any particular stock was improper.&quot;    Many people involved in these transactions had access to the kind of inside information that would explain Mr. Boesky's purchases, including company insiders, lawyers and investment bankers. But Drexel was the only firm involved in all nine of the transactions. Mr. Levine apparently didn't provide Mr. Boesky with inside information about any of these nine transactions even though he worked on two of them, Unocal and Phillips Petroleum. In several of the transactions, Drexel was the only firm involved or was the only firm that knew about impending transactions at the time Mr. Boesky made his purchases.    For example, participants in Maxxam's Sept. 30, 1985, bid for Pacific Lumber recall that it was Drexel's Mr. Milken who promoted Pacific Lumber as an acquisition candidate based on a study of the company prepared by his Beverly Hills, Calif., office. Although David Kay, Drexel's co-head of mergers and acquisitions, often handled negotiations, &quot;everything he said was, 'Mike believes in this; Mike says the values are there.' It was clear that Milken was behind this,&quot; says a participant. (Mr. Milken, by virtue of his position, often acted for Drexel. Others at Drexel were aware of his activities.) Mr. Kay says that it would be inappropriate for him to comment on a transaction under investigation.    Moreover, in financing the bid, Drexel listed a number of entities committing funds that were unknown to Pacific Lumber and its advisers. When the Pacific Lumber people tried to find out the investors' identities, Drexel refused to disclose them, saying that the information was confidential. People close to Pacific Lumber say that in refusing to divulge the identities, Drexel indicated that Drexel officials or clients were involved.    In the case of Unocal, a small group of Drexel officials in the Beverly Hills office knew that Mesa could finance a bid for a majority of Unocal's stock even before Mesa Chairman Pickens did. According to participants, about a week before Mesa's tender offer for Unocal on April 8, 1985, Mesa officials traveled to Beverly Hills, where they met with Peter Ackerman, a top aide of Mr. Milken, who was in Hawaii. At the meeting, they indicated their interest in a bid for at least part of Unocal.    Later that week, the participants say, Drexel officials told Mr. Pickens that Mr. Milken said Drexel could raise $3 billion for the bid -- enough to buy majority control of Unocal. The news took Mr. Pickens by surprise, participants say, because Drexel had never raised such a large amount before. Mesa and Drexel worked together over Easter weekend and publicly announced the tender offer the following Monday.    Mr. Milken also played a major role in a Wickes-Gulf andamp; Western transaction last year. According to participants, it was he who suggested to Gulf andamp; Western Chairman Martin Davis in February 1985 that Mr. Davis get together with Wickes's chairman, Sanford Sigoloff, to discuss the sale of the consumer-products division. They met in March, and the deal was announced in June. Drexel was the only investment-banking firm involved; Gulf andamp; Western used its own executives. &quot;Milken was the key guy; he coordinated it all,&quot; says a participant.    Drexel represented Mr. Icahn in his bid for Phillips, was involved in several Lorimar-MGM transactions and gave Occidental a fairness opinion in connection with its effort to acquire Diamond Shamrock. Drexel has represented Golden Nugget in numerous transactions, and Golden Nugget is a major investor in the junk bonds underwritten by Drexel. A Drexel official says the firm was aware of Golden Nugget's stake in Trans World but wasn't asked to analyze the company as a takeover target; a Golden Nugget official didn't return calls seeking comment. Later, Drexel represented Revlon when it was considering a bid for Trans World.    Two of the transactions suggest that more is being investigated than insider trading.    Fischbach is a New York-based contractor that became the target of a bid for control by Mr. Posner in 1984. Mr. Posner had reached a standstill agreement with Fischbach that limited his holding to less than 25% unless another entity acquired more than 10%. Before Mr. Boesky began acquiring Fischbach stock in April 1984, Drexel client First Executive Corp., led by Fred Carr, acquired more than 10% of Fischbach. Mr. Posner later argued that that freed him from the standstill accord. Fischbach later bought out Mr. Carr's stake.    During the summer of 1984, Mr. Posner increased his stake in Fischbach to 28% and sought antitrust clearance to acquire more than 50%. Just before that announcement, Mr. Boesky disclosed that he had raised his Fischbach stake to 13.4%.    On Feb. 28, 1985, Mr. Boesky sold all of his Fischbach stock for $45 a share on the London Stock Exchange, according to documents filed with the SEC. Fischbach shares were trading that day on the New York Stock Exchange in the high 30s. He also sold $5.7 million in Fischbach convertible debentures in the over-the-counter market at a price that represented a premium over their face value, the SEC filings show.    The same day, a company controlled by Mr. Posner purchased an identical number of shares for $45 each in the so-called third market, according to SEC filings by the Posner-controlled company, Pennsylvania Engineering. It also bought precisely the same amount of convertible debentures that Mr. Boesky sold. Pennsylvania Engineering disclosed that it bought the stock with the proceeds of debt and equity offerings; Drexel handled the debt offering.    Mr. Posner has never disclosed from whom he made his purchases, and Mr. Boesky has never identified who bought his interest. But the timing and the size of the transactions strongly suggest that Mr. Posner bought the stake of Mr. Boesky, presumably through intermediaries.    The day after Mr. Boesky sold, the Posner entity bought more Fischbach shares on the Big Board for just over $39 each, and it bought more of the debentures at a price that represented only 88% of their face value. Mr. Posner ultimately acquired more than 50% of Fischbach's stock and was named its chairman in October 1985.    The Fischbach transactions raise questions that go well beyond insider trading, lawyers familiar with the case say. Were Drexel and Messrs. Posner, Boesky and Carr -- or some combination of them -- secretly working in concert to gain control of Fischbach for Mr. Posner? If so, lawyers suggest, they may have violated SEC disclosure laws, which also carry criminal sanctions. Did Mr. Boesky receive inside information about Mr. Posner's plans? Was Mr. Boesky's stock sale at a premium price a payoff by Mr. Posner for Mr. Boesky's cooperation?    Mr. Carr, First Executive's chairman and president, notes that First Executive began buying Fischbach securities years before Mr. Posner surfaced, adding, &quot;We had no agreement with anyone.&quot; Mr. Posner didn't return calls.    Broad questions also arise from transactions involving Harris Graphics. The company is a Melbourne, Fla., maker of printing equipment that was taken private in 1983 with the help of Drexel. Drexel officials became major shareholders, and a top Drexel merger official, Leon Black, became a Harris director. The company went public again a year later.    In August 1985, Mr. Boesky, who already had a stake in Harris, began heavy buying of additional Harris shares. That same month, AM International privately told Harris that it was interested in acquiring the company, and negotiations began, according to SEC documents. Nothing was disclosed publicly about the talks. In early October, Mr. Boesky increased his stake to 8.4%. Soon after, the talks with AM International broke off.    Mr. Boesky retained his stake. Beginning last March 20, Saul Steinberg-controlled Reliance Financial Services, which was already a Harris shareholder from the original buyout, added to its stake, eventually reaching 5.9%. (Mr. Carr's Executive Life also owned stock in Harris from the original buyout.) At almost exactly the same time, talks between Harris and AM International resumed, according to a participant. On April 17, AM International publicly offered $21 a share for Harris. Harris subsequently accepted AM's sweetened $22-a-share offer.    Messrs. Boesky and Steinberg weren't the only ones who profited handsomely from owning Harris stock in advance of AM's bid. More than 20 Drexel officials, including Mr. Milken, his brother, Lowell, Mr. Ackerman and Dort Cameron, then a senior vice president in the Beverly Hills office, had acquired large amounts of Harris stock at $1 a share when the company originally went private.    According to a former Harris director, a Drexel official from Beverly Hills brought Harris and AM together before they began their merger negotiations in August; at least one meeting between Harris and AM actually took place in Drexel's Beverly Hills office. The Drexel officials were eager to promote a sale of Harris, participants in the talks say, because they would realize huge profits on their holdings.    Drexel didn't represent either Harris or AM in the actual negotiations; other firms did. Nonetheless, participants in the talks say that Drexel officials were actively involved in the negotiations.    Among the unanswered questions: Did Messrs. Boesky or Steinberg receive inside information about the secret merger talks? Did their large, potentially unfriendly positions in Harris encourage Harris officials to complete a sale? Were they working together, separately or in concert with Drexel officials to bring about a sale of Harris?    A spokesman for Mr. Steinberg and Reliance would only say: &quot;The company was a longtime holder and a major holder of Harris stock for three years. All purchases of Harris stock resulted from Reliance's own investment analysis by its own investment professionals.&quot;    Mr. Black, the Drexel official who was a Harris director, says, &quot;It was a classically successful buyout where everyone involved, both private and public, seller and buyer, did well.&quot;    ---         Nine Transactions in the Boesky Investigation  Transaction: Victor Posner acquires control of Fischbach.
