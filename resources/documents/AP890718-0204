The center-right weekly La Cronica said the U.S. official,Bernard Aronson, and the Nicaraguan official, Victor Hugo Tinoco,met during the inauguration of Argentine President Carlos Menem inBuenos Aires on July 8.   ``The news was made known to La Cronica by sources at theNicaraguan Foreign Ministry who are above doubt,'' La Cronica said.``The meeting was absolutely secret and no one else took part exceptMr. Aronson and Mr. Tinoco.''   The United States has turned down a request by President DanielOrtega for talks aimed at improving relations.   Washington has said Nicaragua instead should seek talks with theinternal political opposition.   There was speculation here, but no confirmation, that Aronson metwith Tinoco last week in San Jose, the capital of neighboring CostaRica. Aronson and Ortega both were in Costa Rica on Friday.   Aronson came to Central America on a four-country tour that didnot include Nicaragua.   Ortega had gone to San Jose on Friday on what was announced as aone-day trip to speak with Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. Ortegadid not return to Managua until the following day. Aronson also lefton Saturday.   While in San Jose, Ortega said he would be willing to start talkswith the Nicaraguan political opposition on further reforms toelectoral and news media laws in preparation for general electionsFeb. 25.   Vice President Sergio Ramirez, in an interview with a small groupof journalists on Friday, praised Aronson as ``a civilized man, withwhom one can talk, converse, discuss.''   Ramirez was comparing Aronson with his predecessor, ElliotAbrams, a strong supporter of Contra rebels fighting to overthrowthe Sandinistas.   When asked if he had met with Aronson, Ramirez said, ``No, butTinoco has.'' He did not elaborate.</TEXT></DOC>
