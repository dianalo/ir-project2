(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Five military astronauts boarded thespace shuttle Columbia today and prepared to fly on a secretmission to deploy a high-tech satellite to spy on the Soviet Union.   The weather was perfect and there were no technical problems asa blacked-out countdown advanced toward a liftoff expected about 8a.m.   Because most details about the flight are classified, thePentagon would allow NASA to announce only that liftoff would occurbetween 7:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. The countdown was to be madepublic just nine minutes before the planned liftoff.   A van carrying the astronauts, accompanied by security cars anda hovering helicopter, arrived at the launch pad shortly after 5a.m.   The flight will be the first for Columbia in 3{ years. Duringthe hiatus, the craft has received 258 safety modificationsdictated by the 1986 Challenger explosion.   The ship's return to space will give the space agency a fleet ofthree orbiters to handle an increasing flight schedule. Three moreflights are planned this year and nine in 1990.   The commander is Air Force Col. Brewster Shaw, a veteran of twoearlier missions. The others are Navy Cmdr. Richard Richards, ArmyLt. Col. James Adamson, Air Force Maj. Mark Brown and Navy Cmdr.David Leestma, who flew once previously on a shuttle.   Although mission details are classified, sources close to theprogram said the astronauts will deploy a sophisticated 10-tonreconnaissance satellite to gather intelligence information over awide area of the globe, including much of the Soviet Union, Chinaand the Middle East.   The satellite is designed to take highly detailed photographs oftroop movements, military installations and other targets ofinterest.   The sources said that in the shuttle's cargo bay was a packageof scientific instruments for military research, possibly for the``Star Wars'' missile defense project.   What the astronauts do will not be reported by the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration or the Pentagon.   A blackout was to be imposed throughout the flight, and onlythree brief announcements were planned to report on the health ofthe shuttle and to reveal when it will land at Edwards Air ForceBase, Calif.   The mission is expected to last five days.   The flight is the eighth for Columbia, the oldest of theshuttles, but its first since it flew the last mission before theJan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion.   After the accident, NASA concentrated on modifying the newerorbiters, Discovery and Atlantis, and Columbia spent much of thepast few years as a ``hangar queen,'' stripped to provide spareparts for its sister ships.   Discovery and Atlantis each have made two trips into space sincepost-Challenger flights resumed last September.   During the flight, the astronauts were to check out 258modifications made to Columbia to improve safety and reliability asa result of the accident.   The flight is the 30th for the shuttle program and the fourthdedicated solely to a Defense Department mission.   The Defense Department had planned at least 13 more militarylaunches from the shuttle through the 1990s, but, in the wake ofthe Challenger accident cut that number to seven, shifting severalpayloads to unmanned rockets to get away from reliance on a singlelaunch vehicle.   The Pentagon contends the secrecy of the shuttle militaryflights is necessary to make it more difficult for Sovietsatellites and spy ships off the Florida coast to monitor theflight and know its purpose.   Critics argue that the secrecy is unnecessary because theSoviets, with their intelligence capabilities, undoubtedly alreadyknow a great deal about Columbia's mission, and that once thesatellite is in orbit, the Russians will be able to track themprecisely and know what they are doing.</TEXT></DOC>
