(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA starts the countdown Monday,but Thursday's launch of the space shuttle Atlantis depends onwhether a federal judge permits its five astronauts to dispatch thenuclear-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter.   Anti-nuclear activists have sued to halt the flight, arguingthat a launch accident could spread radioactive plutonium overdensely populated parts of Florida. The space agency maintains thedanger is almost non-existent.   Both sides will argue their cases in U.S. District Court inWashington, D.C., at 10 a.m. Tuesday. Judge Oliver Gasch then willdecide whether to grant a temporary restraining order to stop thelaunch, or to let the countdown proceed. This is the first timeanyone has gone to court to stop a NASA launch.   The plutonium argument overshadows the fact that the missioninvolves the most expensive, most sophisticated unmanned spaceprobe ever built, a vehicle one mission official calls ``theRolls-Royce of spacecraft.''   After a six-year outward journey, Galileo, priced at $1.4billion, is to shoot a probe into Jupiter's atmosphere and thenorbit the planet for two years.   Mission planners say its investigation of Jupiter and its moonswill be the most scientifically rich that interplanetaryexploration has witnessed. The 1979 Voyager views of Jupiter andits satellites were fascinating, but Galileo's images will be 1,000times clearer, they say.   The countdown is to start at 8 a.m. Monday. If Gasch does notrule quickly, the count will pause at the 11-hour mark, for severaldays if necessary, awaiting a decision. Several critical steps,including fueling the shuttle, occur after that point.   If Gasch gives the green light, and no other problems arise,Atlantis is scheduled to blast off at 1:29 p.m. Thursday.   The activists vow that if they lose in court, they willphysically try to stop the liftoff.   ``We are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit onthe launch pad,'' said Bruce Gagnon, coordinator for the FloridaCoalition of Peace and Justice, one of three groups that filed thesuit.   Extra security measures have been in force several days,including closing to the public several roads approaching KennedySpace Center. These roads are normally closed only on launch days.   NASA officials are concerned that Thursday's brief, 10-minutelaunch window would vanish if protesters penetrate the launch zonewith a boat or plane in the count's final minutes.   At issue are Galileo's two generators and their fuel: 48 poundsof radioactive plutonium-238 dioxide.   The activists say that if the space shuttle crashed or exploded,as the Challenger did in 1986, the poisonous plutonium would bereleased into the air.   NASA has said the ``highest probability of launch-area releaseof plutonium due to a shuttle accident is less than 1 in 2,500 andsuch a release would have no appreciable adverse effects on thepopulation.''   The agency quotes health physicists who say this type ofplutonium is relatively harmless unless a particle is inhaled orlodges in an open wound, where it could cause cancer. Generally theparticles do not travel far in air and can be stopped by a piece ofpaper or unbroken human skin.   In tests, empty graphite plutonium containers have been blownup, shot at and burned to determine how they survive all types ofaccidents. They have withstood pressures far greater than thosegenerated by the Challenger explosion, say NASA and the EnergyDepartment, which took part in the testing.   The space agency notes that similar generators have flown on 22space vehicles, including five manned Apollo moon missions, andthat in three instances the well-protected devices survived severeaccidents: two unmanned rockets that blew up in the 1960s and theexplosion aboard Apollo 13 in 1970, which forced abandonment of amoon landing.   Plutonium 238's normal decay gives off intense heat, whichGalileo will convert to electricity. No other power source ispractical for space missions too far from the sun to use solarenergy.   The five astronauts who will fly the mission say they are notconcerned about flying with plutonium.   ``I have no absolutely no qualms about the devices,'' saidcommander Donald Williams.   Pilot Mike McCulley was more blunt: ``I don't see how it canhurt anyone unless it hits him on the head, and that's prettyremote. I think it is a complete non-issue except as aphilosophical issue to some people.''   ``My family is going to be down there watching the launch, aswell as other people that I love, and so I'm not concerned aboutit; I feel it's safe,'' said mission specialist Ellen Baker.   The other crew members, mission specialists Shannon Lucid andFranklin Chang-Diaz, expressed similar feelings.   Six hours after liftoff, the astronauts are to release Galileofrom the cargo bay. An hour later, an attached motor will start the6,700-pound craft on a six-year trip that will cover 2.4 billionmiles on the path to Jupiter, the largest planet in our solarsystem.   Along the way, Galileo will obtain fly-by data about the moon,Venus and at least one asteroid, Gaspra. It will make two returnswings to within 600 miles of Earth.   In December 1995 a 737-pound probe released from the spacecraftis to plunge into Jupiter's cloud layers at 115,000 mph and makethe first direct sampling of the Jovian atmosphere. Slowed quicklyby the thickening atmosphere, the probe will pop a parachute andtransmit data to the Galileo mother ship for about an hour as itdescends about 360 miles before it is crushed and vaporized byextreme heat and pressure.   Galileo will fire into orbit about the planet, and its 10scientific instruments will gather information on temperatures,magnetic fields, radiation, cloud characteristics and gravityfields.   Of particular interest will be the dynamics of a weather systemthat produce the ever-changing bands, whirls and plumes seen fromEarth and from the two Voyager spacecraft.   The weather includes storms up to 25,000 miles across that haveraged for centuries. Among them is the mysterious Great Red Spot,which the Voyagers determined is a tremendous atmospheric stormsimilar to Earth's hurricanes.   The Voyagers also found that Jupiter, 318 times more massivethan Earth, is a whirling ball of mostly liquid hydrogen, topped byan atmosphere that is mostly hydrogen and helium. They discovered anarrow ring of debris around the planet and found three new moons,raising the toal to 16.   The four largest moons bear the same relationship to theirplanet as planets in our solar system do to the sun _ the nearestbeing solid rock, like Mercury, and the farthest being a slush ballwith a rock in the center, like gaseous Neptune.   Thus, Galileo will examine data and transmit pictures of aminiature solar system as it orbits Jupiter, said Edward C. Stone,professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, whois one of the mission scientists.   ``Galileo will give us more than just snapshots in passing, asthe Voyagers did,'' Stone said. ``Being there and observing over aperiod of nearly two years will allow us to sort out the dynamicsof Jupiter and its moons.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 8</NOTE></DOC>
