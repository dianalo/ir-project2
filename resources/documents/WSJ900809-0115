About 40,000 of China's workers in the nuclear industryare idle, a result of a sharp decrease in the demand formilitary orders in the past few years and a two-yearausterity program that tightened credit to halt runawayinflation, the China Daily reported. Last year, the industryposted a profit for the first time in three years, duelargely to its civilian products, the report said.   In 1989, civilian goods accounted for 42% of theindustry's production -- six times more than in 1980. Theyincluded rare earth metals, man-made diamonds and medicalequipment as well as such non-nuclear items as smoke alarmsand chemical fertilizers, the report said.   The nuclear industry has set a goal of producing twobillion yuan ($422 million) of civilian goods by 1995 -- a150% increase over last year, the paper said.
