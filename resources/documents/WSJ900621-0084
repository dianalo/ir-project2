The new service, called MCI Vision, is based on a flatper-minute charge and is targeted at companies that spendbetween $500 and $50,000 a month on long-distance service.</LP><TEXT>   Timothy Price, MCI's vice president for general business,said the package includes flat-rate pricing, volumediscounts, virtual private-line services, and a comprehensivebill that lists credit-card calls as well as domestic andinternational long-distance charges for all of a company'sbranch offices. Calls can be tracked by employee, departmentsor calling cards.   The $18 billion smaller-business segment of thelong-distance industry is getting more attention ascompetition has squeezed margins in the residential andbig-business segments. &quot;MCI is focusing its sales force onthe middle market because that's where the richest marginsare,&quot; said Edward Greenberg of Morgan Stanley. &quot;Frankly, themargins are drying up in the high end.&quot;   Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber, said the MCImove shows that competition is shifting away from pricecutting. &quot;This isn't some deep discount,&quot; he said. &quot;It's anattempt to bring down functionality to a lower marketsegment.&quot; MCI, he said, is &quot;clearly reacting to ATandamp;T'ssuccess in defending its share of the middle market.&quot;   While American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s share of themiddle market is about 50%, MCI figures it has 14% to 15%. Toincrease its share, MCI has beefed up its sales force byabout 500 since the beginning of the year, Mr. Price said.   At ATandamp;T, Joseph Nacchio, vice president-marketing forbusiness communications services, said ATandamp;T could replicatethe MCI package in a couple of days, but wants to watch MCI'sperformance first. &quot;We were waiting for some killer product,&quot;he said. &quot;But I didn't find anyone here lying down becausebullets were flying.&quot;   Investors apparently expected a more significantannouncement as well. MCI's shares fell 87.5 cents to $41.625in national over-the-counter trading. ATandamp;T's shares rose 37.5cents to $43.125 in New York Stock Exchange compositetrading.   To promote the new service, MCI launched amultimillion-dollar advertising campaign developed by Wells,Rich, Greene Inc. The campaign, which uses the tag line&quot;Big-business long distance for your business,&quot; includes 15-and 30-second television spots. The spots are being airedduring network morning and evening news shows and sportsprograms, as well as CNN business shows and ESPN baseballgames. The company also has a print campaign that will be runin newspapers and local business journals.   Among the MCI Vision features is a &quot;hotline&quot; service thatallows a caller to connect automatically to a telephone inanother city. Another is a &quot;remote&quot; service that allows acompany to maintain a local number that actually rings at adistant location. If a company does a lot of business in onecity, but doesn't want to maintain an office there, it canset up a number that would be answered at the company's mainoffice.   Basic rates for domestic service are 20 cents a minutebetween 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. for direct dialed calls into theMCI network and 15 cents for calls placed through a directconnection between the customer and the MCI network. Off-peakcalls are 20% less. Rates for international calls are basedon the destination, time of day and type of access to the MCInetwork. MCI also is offering customers the option ofdelivering bills on paper or magnetic tape.   &quot;This is a one-size fits-all product,&quot; Mr. Price said. &quot;Itcan grow as the company grows. Some companies that end upbuying this product may not use every feature -- yet.&quot;   Earlier this year, in another major attempt to gain marketshare in the general business market, MCI announced plans toacquire Telecom USA for $1.25 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
