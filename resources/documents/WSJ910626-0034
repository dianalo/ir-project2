Toronto-Dominion uses the word &quot;green&quot; to identify morethan 20 products and services, including its &quot;Green Machine&quot;automatic teller machines and &quot;Green Line&quot; securitiesservices.</LP><TEXT>   The bank seeks interim and permanent injunctions toprevent Canada Trust, the principal financial services arm ofCT Financial Services Inc., from using the word or colorgreen to sell any financial services. It also is seeking 55million Canadian dollars (US$48.1 million) in relief.   &quot;The trust company is using the word and color green toidentify its financial services and {Toronto Dominion} isconcerned that this will cause confusion in the public's mindand is infringing on the bank's trademarks,&quot; the bank said.   Canada Trust last September introduced a &quot;green&quot; savingsaccount program. By designating their accounts &quot;green,&quot;customers agree to automatically donate one cent for everydollar of interest earned to their local chapter of theFriends of the Environment Foundation. The donation ismatched by Canada Trust.   &quot;It's pretty hard to patent the word `green',&quot; said JohnRichardson, executive vice-chairman and chief financialofficer of CT Financial. He said Canada Trust plans to fightthe action.   The bank said it has &quot;no concerns about how green is usedby nonfinancial institutions for their products.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
