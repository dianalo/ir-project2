 While a low-cost pen plotter may be appropriate for precision colorgraphics, other companies select a more expensive electrostatic plotter forits fast performance and high-quality output.andM;Direct-imaging plotters are another option for buyers who don't need thecolor capabilities of a pen or electrostatic machine.andM;Tom Fisher, a facilities engineer at General Electric Aircraft Engines'jet-engine maintenance center in Arkansas City, Kan., chose Raster GraphicsInc.'s Colorstation electrostatic plotter for its speed.andP;  The Colorstation,which only operates on D-sized (24-by-36-inch) paper, can plot 1.75 inchesper minute, according to officials at Raster Graphics in Sunnyvale, Calif.andM;&quot;We were using a andlsqb;Hewlett-Packard Co.andrsqb; pen plotter, but the speed wasn'tthere,&quot; Fisher said.andM;The electrostatic plotter is used by the center's facilities department,which manages the building, to output drawings of the building layout, Fisherexplained.andP;  The Colorstation plotter is connected to two 386-based Compaqcomputers running Autodesk Inc.'s AutoCAD software.andP;  The plotter is hooked toa printer-sharing device instead of operating on a network, Fisher said.andM;The Colorstation provides four primary colors, a feature Fisher needs inorder to differentiate between hazardous areas, plumbing and machinery on thedraft of the building layout.andP;  When these four colors -- cyan, magenta,yellow and black -- are mixed in the computer, the palette expands to 256colors.andM;&quot;But there is a limitation of the AutoCAD software, which only supports 16colors,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;If you want to do special colors, andlsqb;the colorsandrsqb; have to beandlsqb;configuredandrsqb; in the plotter,&quot; Fisher said.andM;Maintaining the plotter can be burdensome.andP;  Cleaning the Colorstation meansreaching behind the machine, Fisher said.andP;  In addition, the cleaning solventcontains highly flammable isopropyl alcohol, so the cleaning rags must behung to dry before they are discarded.andM;But Fisher is generally satisfied with the Colorstation.andP;  &quot;This is not reallyan inconvenience,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I had more problems with the andlsqb;HPandrsqb; pen plotterthan I've had with this.andP;  The pens were always drying out, and the drawingswould have various line widths.&quot; John Kenderesi is another supporter ofelectrostatic plotters.andP;  As the manager of CAD operations at OlympicReprographics Inc. in Seattle, Kenderesi produces plots for architects andengineers.andP;  He needs a high-quality machine that is fast and reliable becausehe generates about 1,000 plots a week.andP;  He also needs to have a color option.andM;The firm uses two of Graphtec Precision Image Corp.'s C448 electrostaticcolor plotters and a Versatec 8836-II laser monochrome plotter from XeroxEngineering Systems, a subsidiary of Xerox Corp. in Santa Clara, Calif.andM;&quot;We can't use pen plotters because a lot of these andlsqb;drawingsandrsqb; are solidplots,&quot; Kenderesi said.andP;  Pen plotters are designed for drawing lines; whenthey plot a solid block of color, the paper becomes saturated.andM;But Kenderesi said that the speed of the C448 electrostatic plotter is itsmost attractive feature.andM;&quot;andlsqb;The C448andrsqb; is faster than anything else I've used or seen,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Ittakes about 2 minutes to do the same thing that a pen plotter would do in anhour and a half.&quot;andM;The C448 electrostatic plotter is even faster than Kenderesi's Xerox laserplotter.andP;  The Xerox plots solid, black images and has the ability to drawabout 45 E-sized (36-by-48-inch) plots per hour, he said.andM;Unlike electrostatic plotters, laser plotters don't require specially coatedpaper.andM;Although Kenderesi and Fisher prefer electrostatic plotters, other buyerssaid they prefer pen plotters.andM;A spokeswoman at a large commercial railroad in Fort Worth, Texas, who askedto remain anonymous, said pen plotters best fit her department's needs.andM;&quot;We have an electrostatic plotter in another department, and in my opinion,the resolution is not as good as pen,&quot; she said.andM;The company uses Oce Graphics USA Inc.'s G1845-AC and G1835-S model penplotters to produce maps and business graphics, which need high-qualityoutput.andM;Oce pen plotters were chosen because of their emulation and hardwareconnection options, the spokeswoman said.andM;One of the models is already operating off an IBM 3090 mainframe and aDOS-based PC via a printer-sharing device.andP;  The railroad also plans toinstall one of the Oce plotters on a Unix LAN.andM;But the company has had one problem with the Oce Graphics 1835S model.andP;  &quot;Itdoesn't have an automatic pen-sensing capability so that the plotter knowswhat kind of pen is in there,&quot; the spokeswoman said.andP;  A plotter withoutpen-sensing must be manually adjusted.andM;Direct-imaging plotters are also preferable to electrostatic plotters becausethey are easier to maintain, buyers said.andM;Paul Chalker, a senior aerospace engineer at the Garrett Engine Division ofAllied Signal Aerospace Co., builders of turbine engines in Phoenix, foundproductivity rose when the division switched from electrostatic plotters todirect imaging, he said.andM;The Garrett Engine Division is using seven CalComp Computer Graphics GroupDrawingMaster Plus Model 52236 direct-imaging plotters on an Ethernet LAN.andM;Direct imaging &quot;has reduced manpower,&quot; Chalker said.andP;  &quot;It's easy to use, andthere is no toxic waste.andM;&quot;The maintenance is zero,&quot; Chalker said.andP;  &quot;I used to have a person who spent20 hours a week cleaning the electrostatic plotters.andP;  Now it's 5 minutes amonth.&quot;andM;During the summer in Phoenix, when the humidity is low, the electrostaticplotters also required a humidifier because the coated paper used by theseplotters is sensitive to varying temperatures.andP;  Environmental factors are notan issue with direct imaging, Chalker said.andM;The engineering division also has two Calcomp pen plotters, but they are usedfor different applications.andM;&quot;We need pen plotters for optical comparisons,&quot; Chalker said.andP;  &quot;The absoluteaccuracy produced by pen cannot andlsqb;be obtainedandrsqb; on the andlsqb;direct-imagingplotterandrsqb;.&quot;andM;However, the pens in pen plotters can run out unexpectedly and ruin theoutput, he said.andM;The reliability of the direct-imaging plotter appeals to Chalker.andP;  &quot;We runthousands of E-sized plots without problems,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
