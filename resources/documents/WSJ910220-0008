Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, reported abigger-than-expected pretax loss for 1990 and said it plansto seek a hefty capital injection from a national bankguarantee fund.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile in neighboring Sweden, surging credit losses andprovisions against suspected bad loans slashed 1990 operatingprofit by 26% at the nation's No. 1 bank, SkandinaviskaEnskilda Banken.   By contrast, Svenska Handelsbanken, also of Sweden,managed to hold credit losses in check, boosting 1990operating profit by 17% and underscoring its position asScandinavia's most profitable bank.   Den norske Bank said it tumbled to a pretax loss of 1.29billion kroner ($223.3 million) last year from a pretaxprofit of 343 million kroner a year earlier. The big Oslobank said operating profit last year -- excluding loan lossprovisions -- skidded 29% to 2.54 billion kroner from 3.58billion kroner the previous year.   Pretax profit for the SE Banken group, which includesfinancial units in Sweden and banking units abroad, skidded36% to 2.92 billion Swedish kronor ($528.2 million) from 4.58billion kronor a year earlier.   Crosstown rival Svenska Handelsbanken deftly digestedseveral small 1989 acquisitions. And in sharp contrast tosome big Stockholm banks that inherited a spate of problemloans along with acquisitions made at about the same time,Handelsbanken's new additions swelled profit, not loan lossprovisions.   Operating profit last year for the Handelsbanken groupclimbed to 4.56 billion kronor from 3.88 billion kronor theprevious year.</TEXT></DOC>
