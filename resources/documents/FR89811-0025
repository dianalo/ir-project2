On July 6, 1988,MMS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (53 FR 25349) to amend the regulationsto recognize the API quality assurance program using API Spec Q1 in combinationwith API Spec 14A and Spec 14D as an acceptable alternative to the ANSI/ASMEquality assurance program using ANSI/ASME SPPE-1 and to incorporate the1988 edition of ANSI/ASME SPPE-1 in lieu of the 1985 edition. Since thattime, API has issued its August 1989 Supplements to API Spec 14A and Spec14D. These supplements provide for operators to report receipt of API Spec14A and Spec 14D equipment to manufacturers. They also provide for thereporting of equipment failures to API and the manufacturers. Since severalof the comments received in response to the proposed rule concerned similarreporting provisions, MMS is reopening the comment period to allow partiesto review the supplements to API Spec 14A and Spec 14D and to submit additionalcomments on the basis of these supplements.The proposed rule remains unchanged from the rule proposed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice of July 6, 1988, except that the editionsof API Spec 14A and Spec 14D proposed to be incorporated by reference includeSupplement 1 of August 1989 for each of the documents.The MMS is also holding a public meeting to discuss the proposed rule.The public meeting will be held at the time and location given above.Comment submitted during the original comment period need not be resubmitted.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 4, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William D.
