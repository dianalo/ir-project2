(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal grand jury today indicted thehead of Pennsylvania's student loan agency and his former top aide,charging that they were involved in a scheme to extort money from acontractor.   The indictment names Kenneth Reeher, executive director of thePennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, who is the state'shighest-paid employee; and Harry Casoni, a former deputy whoretired in 1986.   Also charged was Gabler Educational Management Services Inc., ofLibertyville, Ill., according to an announcement by U.S. AttorneyJames West. He said the company is expected to plead guilty to abribery charge later today.   The investigation, which has spanned more than a year,continues, he said.   Reeher, the only state employee to make more than $100,000 ayear, counting bonuses, has denied any wrongdoing.   John Ebersole, a spokesman for the student loan agency, saidReeher ``told us he would have no comment today. He expects to meetwith the officers of the board early next week, and he may havesomething to say at that time.''   The agency operates a financial-assistance program for collegestudents and holds contracts with lenders and agencies in otherstates to service student loans.   Last week, officials said an internal review of the case foundno evidence of wrongdoing by any current loan agency employee orofficial.
