(social issues surrounding theuse of computers in criminal investigation)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Jerome, Marty.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Civil liberties disputes may arise more frequently with theincreased use of computers in criminal investigation.andP;  The keyissues will involve the type of information collected, theintegrity of the information, and how it is used in fightingcrime.andP;  Computers must not be used as scapegoats to allow users toescape accountability for the information entered and the use ofthe information.andP;  Additionally, information once entered must beguarded from tampering, a task which becomes more difficult asmicrocomputers replace mainframes as the machines of choice.andO;Finally, civil libertarians believe that the practice of'profiling' the perpetrator of a crime violates the constitutionalconcept of 'innocent until proven guilty' when a group of suspectsincludes persons with no criminal record.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     MicrocomputersIssues-Society.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Question of Civil LibertiesandM;A known drug kingpin is murdered.andP;  Police investigators enter clues to thehomicide into an expert system, which generates a composite description ofthe murderer and a list of suspects who match it.andP;  A judge issues an arrestwarrant based on the expert system's results.andM;* Statistics show that most home burglaries in one area of Chicago arecommitted by young, unemployed Hispanic males.andP;  A home is broken into in thatpart of the city, and witnesses claim that a yellow Camaro was parked outfront for about an hour.andP;  No other information is available.andP;  Police pullfrom their database a list of all young, unemployed Hispanic males in thearea who own yellow Camaros.andP;  They dispatch officers to bring in the youngmen named on the printout for questioning.andM;* A qualified applicant for a high-security position at a defense plant isturned down.andP;  Six months later, she is wrongly picked up by the police onsuspicion of cocaine smuggling.andP;  The mistaken identity arose from a dataentry error in the police department's database--the same error thatdisqualified her for the defense plant job.andM;Though hypothetical, these cases illustrate the civil liberties conflictsthat may arise with increasing frequency as police departments make heavieruse of computers to investigate crime.andP;  The key to such disputes will be whatkinds of data law enforcers can collect, the integrity of the information,and how it can be used for fighting crime.andM;The trouble lies partly with accountability.andP;  Some observers fear that theability to blame a mistaken arrest on a computer will encourage policeofficers to be casual about hauling people down to the station.andP;  &quot;Ultimately,someone has to be held responsible for making those decisions,&quot; says MarcRotenberg, counsel to the Senate Subcommittee on Technology and the Law.andO;&quot;They can't hide behind an expert system.&quot;andM;Such errors are inevitable, say rights advocates.andP;  They contend that a systemsuch as Los Angeles's HITMAN is flawed because it leads detectives to believethat the computer can find meaningful patterns in random observations enteredabout a number of crimes.andP;  &quot;Unless you have a very rigid coding procedure,the search can miss real matches or can give you erroneous hits,&quot; says GaryChapman, executive director of Computer Professionals for SocialResponsibility.andP;  This could result in false arrests, which many view asharassment.andM;Once collected, information must be protected against accidental ordeliberate alteration.andP;  This problem becomes nettlesome as informationmigrates from well-secured mainframe computers into PCs, where it can besabotaged with relative ease.andP;  &quot;Anytime you have data degradation in thedatabase,&quot; Chapman contends, &quot;you have potential civil liberties problems.&quot;andM;Equally troubling is the way police departments use the information that isgathered.andP;  A case in point is the expert system developed by Edward Ratledgeat the University of Delaware.andP;  Ratledge's system sifts through crime datafor clues to what the perpetrator is like; thes characteristics can then bematched to suspects.andP;  Although the courts have not ruled definitively, civillibertarians believe that this practice, called profiling, tramples on theconstitutional presumption of innocence when a group of suspects includespersons with no criminal record.andM;Similar concerns are voiced about the Los Angeles Police Department's use ofcomputers to monitor gang activity.andP;  &quot;If police subjectively decide thatsomebody is a gang member and then enter him into a database, that woulddefinitely be a [civil liberties] problem,&quot; says Chapman.andM;Police don't need high technology to infringe on civil liberties, of course.andO;Equally unfair practices can occur using data collected on paper.andP;  Butcomputers--especially PCs--make abuse much easier.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
