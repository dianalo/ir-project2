On other markets, orange juice futures plunged; grains andsoybeans were higher; energy futures were mixed; and livestock andmeat futures were mixed.   Gold settled $6.10 to $6.40 lower with the contract for deliveryin August at $372.20 a troy ounce. Silver was 0.8 cent to 1.5 centshigher with July at $5.207 a troy ounce.   Analysts attributed gold's retreat mainly to the LaborDepartment's report of a 0.1 percent decline in wholesale prices inJune. The market had been expecting the report to show an increaseof 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent.   The Commerce Department's report of a 0.4 percent drop in retailsales last month _ making for the first back-to-back drop in morethan two years _ was also discouraging to gold traders.   But the Federal Reserve's report of slowing industrial productionand factory use sent a mixed message to the inflation-sensitive goldmarket, suggesting both a reduction in inflationary pressures _which is bearish for gold _ and the possibility that the Fed willcontinue to ease up on interest rates, which is bullish for gold.   ``The economic reports were not all that bearish,'' said FredDemler, metals economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in NewYork.   Demler pointed out that gold prices had risen by about $20 anounce since early June and said that when the wholesale-pricesreport came out Friday morning, ``traders saw it as an opportunityto take profits.''   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures fell the permitted5-cents-a-pound daily limit on the New York Cotton Exchange and thesoon-to-expire July contract, which has no limit, plunged 6.3 centsto settle at $1.7135 a pound.   Analysts linked the sharp drop to rumors that a large Floridaprocessor planned to cut prices due to a large Brazilian orange crop.   Grain and soybean futures prices finished moderately higher onthe Chicago Board of Trade on bullish weather forecasts andindications of Soviet purchases of South American soybean meal.   Soybean traders shifted their attention back to supply-and-demandfactors after focusing for two days on wrangling between theexchange and a large Italian company over the exchange's demand thattraders reduce their holdings in the July soybean contract.   Soybean prices had fallen in early trading Friday following afederal court ruling Thursday evening that upheld the exchange'sorder.   Two subsidiaries of the Italian agribusiness firm FerruzziFinanziara SpA had sought a court order blocking the directive,which Ferruzzi claimed was aimed at weakening its market position.   Wheat settled 1 cent to 4{ cents higher with July at $3.95\ abushel; corn was { cent to 3{ cents higher with July at $2.59} abushel; oats were 2\ cents higher across the board with July at$1.50{ a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 13{ cents higher with Julyat $7.03{ a bushel.   Energy futures finished lower in a light, lackluster session onthe New York Mercantile Exchange.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents lower to 14cents higher with August at $20.32 a barrel; heating oil was .11cent lower to .06 cent higher with August at 49.33 cents a gallon;unleaded gasoline was .02 cent to .62 cent lower with August at56.84 cents a gallon.   Cattle futures finished narrowly mixed on the Chicago MercantileExchange as late profit-taking erased earlier gains linked tostronger cash markets. Pork futures were mostly higher, boosted bystrong cash markets.   Live cattle settled .17 cent lower to .50 cent higher with Augustat 71.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent lower to .15cent higher with August at 82.95 cents a pound; hogs were .08 centlower to .58 cent higher with July at 47.50 cents a pound; frozenpork bellies were .25 cent lower to .50 cent higher with July at29.37 cents a pound.</TEXT></DOC>
