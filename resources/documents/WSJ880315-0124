The 485 workers, represented by the Confederation of National Trade Unions, voted Friday in favor of a new, three-year collective agreement, despite the recommendation of their union executive to reject the pact. Montreal-based Alcan immediately lifted a lockout that it imposed Oct. 31.    An Alcan spokesman said that it will begin to restart potlines at the smelter tomorrow and that the facility should be back in full operation by early May. The smelter has annual capacity of 84,000 metric tons of aluminum. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.    The new contract, which expires in March 1991, is similar to a pact approved earlier this month by 6,000 Alcan workers at three other Quebec smelters. Those workers, who were represented by another union, approved the pact without a strike or lockout.    The contract here calls for wage increases totaling 11% over the three years. The average hourly wage at the end of the old pact was 16.85 Canadian dollars ($13.41). The workers here also will receive a signing bonus of a maximum of 286 dollars. The workers at the other Quebec smelters received a 1,000 dollar bonus. </TEXT></DOC>
