He does what he can to set them right. In the meantime, though, he is making an end run around their snobbery: He is selling wine to the French.    &quot;Our customers buy it as a curiosity item at first,&quot; says Louis Jarrousse, a Parisian distributor. &quot;But when they try it, they find it is a correct wine.&quot; Stephen Spurrier also admires Mr. Carr Taylor's wines and has sold them at his two Paris wine stores. In all, the French consume 20,000 bottles a year from Mr. Carr Taylor's small vineyard in the misty hills of southern England.    A lot of other Englishmen have started producing wine lately, although almost no one encourages them to. At last count there were 350 English wineries; just a handful existed when Mr. Carr Taylor started.    Long ago, however, the English countryside was a bountiful producer of wine. The Romans drank it, monks drank it, and English kings drank it. But in 1154 Henry II acquired a chunk of France and lowered the tariff on imported wine. It was downhill from there until the 16th century, when Henry VIII finally closed the last wine-producing English monastery.    Then in the early 1970s Mr. Carr Taylor took a crack at it. A mild-mannered engineer who used to install industrial heating systems, he decided to plant part of his small farm in white grapes from the colder regions of Germany and Switzerland. To cope with the shortage of sunshine, he invented a special trellis that exposed more of the vine to light. Between this and England's slightly longer summer days, he figured, the vines should get about as much light as in Germany.    But English wine making isn't for the faint-hearted. Last summer Mr. Carr Taylor's 21-acre vineyard survived three solid weeks of rain, only to be hit by a hurricane that blew in tons of salt water and overturned many of his trellises.    Meanwhile, English badgers have found they can enjoy the new grape varieties by tearing out vines and eating them from the roots up. Badgers are a protected species in England.    The Common Market, overflowing with wine and wary of new competition, requires that all bottles from England bear the label &quot;table wine.&quot; This tells consumers the wine is nothing special.    But the greatest obstacle of all to English wine making is the attitude of Englishmen. Start with the government: Instead of subsidizing wine making, as many European countries do, it slaps on a stiff tax, equal to about $1.30 a bottle. It is particularly burdensome when you are restricted to selling &quot;table wine.&quot;    Then there are the shops and restaurants. English vineyards have begun to win international awards for their wines, which are mostly fresh-tasting whites with a pleasant, fruity &quot;nose.&quot; But getting London's liquor stores and fancy eateries to take as much as a sniff has been &quot;a long, hard slog,&quot; Mr. Carr Taylor says.    Consumers, when they can find English wines at all, sometimes confuse them with &quot;British wines,&quot; which are made from imported grape juice and fortified with alcohol. British wines appeal to a different clientele, which is occasionally seen sipping them from a bottle in a paper bag.    Most dismaying to vintners are the notions of English wine critics. An influential one named Robin Young, for instance, sampled 20 English wines and condemned them as &quot;flat, dull, dead, foul, acidic, sulphurous&quot; and &quot;nasty.&quot; His column was headed &quot;Don't Drink the Flag.&quot;    Mr. Carr Taylor, upset, challenged the critic to a blind taste test: 10 English wines against 10 world-class whites picked by Mr. Young. When a jury of English wine experts selected the dozen they liked best, half turned out to be English. The experts pronounced themselves duly impressed, with the exception of Mr. Young.    Geoffrey Bond, the head of the English Vineyards Association, is attempting to build on such successes. He often drives around the country in his truck with an assortment of English white wines, trying to turn public opinion around. It isn't easy. &quot;The English impression is the only really good wines are red and come from France,&quot; Mr. Bond says. &quot;Everywhere I go, people are surprised to know that there are any English wines at all.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
