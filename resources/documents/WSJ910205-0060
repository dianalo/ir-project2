Last week, as the Feshbachs' losses mounted, they quietlyput out a call for more money from their investment partners.The Feshbachs denied yesterday that their business was in anytrouble, but conceded that their portfolios have fallen about15% in value so far this year.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's never fun to lose money,&quot; Joe Feshbach, one of thefirm's partners, said in an interview.   Short-sellers, of course, make money betting on fallingstock prices and lose if prices rally. They borrow shares andimmediately sell them, hoping to repurchase the stock laterat a lower price.   Wall Street traders watch the Feshbachs closely. The threebrothers run a $1 billion pool of capital, and they are abarometer of bearish sentiment. Yesterday, traders were abuzzwith speculation that the powerful stock-market rally mightforce the Feshbachs and other short-sellers to &quot;cover&quot; theirpositions by buying back borrowed stock at a higher price.This process is known as a &quot;short squeeze&quot; and can sometimesheighten a stock market rally.   &quot;A lot of guys are buying stocks because of unfoundedrumors that we will be out of business next week,&quot; Mr.Feshbach said. And, denying that the Feshbachs are coveringtheir short positions, he vowed, &quot;People who are buying inthe hope that they can sell to us when we cover are likely towake up with a bad hangover.&quot;   Mr. Feshbach asserted that his partnership is solicitingmore capital merely on the belief that the market's surge hascreated a good opportunity for shorting stocks, much as aplunge creates an opportunity for buyers.   That's not the way many investors see things. In thecurrent rally, buyers apparently have been putting particularemphasis on stocks that have been targeted by professionalshort-sellers. Shares of Marriott Corp., for instance, surgedmore than 10% yesterday. In part, it was because the lodgingcompany negotiated a new credit agreement. But some analystswho follow the stock also said short-sellers of Marriottmight lose their nerve.   Some 12 million shares of Marriott have been sold short --13% of the total outstanding -- on the belief that Marriottis overleveraged. The new credit agreement &quot;could shake shortsellers' convictions,&quot; C.J. Lawrence analyst James Murrensaid in a report to clients yesterday.   Other stocks, all shorted by the Feshbachs, that have beenswept up in the rally include Citicorp, Wells Fargo andamp; Co.,McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Westinghouse Electric Corp. Suchpopular short-seller targets as Household International Inc.,HomeFed Corp. and News Corp also have recently risen. &quot;A lotof hot-money types are buying stocks just because there arebig short positions,&quot; one money manager said.   Some shorts are already running for cover. One activetrader who had sold financial stocks short last year isRichard Perry, managing partner of Perry Partners, a New Yorkmoney management firm. Mr. Perry said he covered the last ofthose short positions last week, after merger talks werereported between Wells Fargo and Security Pacific Corp. Whileshort-selling financial stocks was a winning strategy in1990, he said, &quot;it's working badly this year.&quot;   Stocks shorted by the Feshbachs, in particular, appear tobe rising more than most. According to unconfirmed reports,some traders have made a strategy out of buying stocks thatthe Feshbachs have shorted. Mr. Feshbach didn't dispute that.&quot;You don't have to be paranoid to think we're beingtargeted,&quot; he said.   The Feshbachs, somewhat like the banks whose stocks theyhave sold short, use borrowed money to increase their assets.Thus, their losses can widen more quickly in a rising market.   However, Mr. Feshbach maintained that because no one stockrepresents more than 5% of the group's equity, &quot;no oneposition could put us out of business.&quot; He also pointed outthat the Feshbachs have survived numerous stock-marketrallies. Last year, he said, the Feshbachs' portfolios roseby 57%. &quot;The stocks of these companies may be rising,&quot; hesaid, &quot;but that won't help the companies pay their debts ordevelop better products.&quot;   ---   James A.
