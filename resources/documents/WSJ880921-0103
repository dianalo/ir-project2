Michael Dukakis's presidential campaign is investing enormous resources in Washington state and across much of the West on voters such as these three, all of whom voted twice for Ronald Reagan, and on places such as Snohomish County, critical swing areas that have helped the Republicans keep a two-decade lock on the region.    &quot;I'm disappointed with the Republicans,&quot; says Mrs. Priebe, who has never voted for a Democrat for president. Mr. Anderson, who has four college-bound sons, says he's &quot;tired of seeing the schools being a poor country cousin to defense.&quot;    In what has been a dismal campaign for the Democrats, the mainland West, where the party has won only one state in presidential voting since the Lyndon Johnson landslide of 1964, may provide the one surprising bright spot. The Democrats are taking an important gamble by emphasizing places such as the highlands of Snohomish County and refusing to relinquish the region's 111 electoral votes without a fight -- though it is, as Rep. Pat Williams of Montana says, a decidedly uphill struggle.    California, with its 47 electoral votes, is an important battleground that the Democrats believe they must win. Outside California, the Dukakis campaign has its greatest opportunity here in the Pacific Northwest, where polls in both Oregon and Washington place the Massachusetts governor even with Vice President George Bush or slightly ahead. Democratic strategists also see openings in Colorado, New Mexico and Montana, all states where unemployment has been a problem.    In the past several elections, the Republicans have had a lock on victory by piecing together 109 electoral votes from Dixie (excluding Texas), 107 from the West (excluding Hawaii) and enough from the Great Plains and a handful of other dependable GOP redoubts to get more than the 270 needed for election -- before even touching the populous industrial states and Texas.    The new Democratic offensive here is based on the belief that Mr. Bush doesn't have the natural Western appeal of President Reagan, who galvanized the anti-government sentiment of the region and capitalized on his own brand of gunslinger politics, particularly on questions of national security.    &quot;People look at Bush,&quot; Democratic state Rep. Michael Kopetski of Salem, Ore., says bluntly, &quot;and they know he's a pansy.&quot;    The Dukakis strategists believe that voters who elected Democratic governors such as Washington's Booth Gardner and Oregon's Neil Goldschmidt -- men known as crisp, efficient managers who emphasize regional economic development -- will feel comfortable with a Democratic nominee who shares the same approaches. And they hope that the economic distress in the lumber towns, farming communities and mining areas of the region will prompt voters to reject the Republicans.    &quot;There's still a lot of hurt in a good portion of the West,&quot; says Democratic Rep. Ron Wyden of Oregon.    Even so, Mr. Dukakis faces a formidable challenge.    &quot;If they write off the West, they're playing to lose, but for the life of me I can't guess what appeal Dukakis has for those folks,&quot; says Ed Rogers, a top Bush aide. &quot;The West is just not going to vote against a Republican candidate who is for a less intrusive federal government.&quot;    Although the West depended on the federal government in opening up the region for settlement, passing the Homestead Act and spurring the development of the railroads, Westerners retain a skepticism of the nation's capital. In modern political terms, that skepticism translates into problems for the Democrats, who are perceived here more than anywhere else as the party of government.    &quot;The New Deal social welfare programs of the national Democratic Party have almost no appeal here,&quot; says Michael Lyons, a Utah State University specialist in Western politics. James Klonski, a University of Oregon political scientist, says, &quot;For decades the West saw the Democrats as an urban, Eastern party who always seemed a long way -- geographically, socially, economically -- from us out here.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis has problems, too, because he is seen as weak and inexperienced on matters of national security and vulnerable on the issue of gun control, important in a region where a popular bumper sticker proclaims: &quot;I'd rather trade my wife than my gun.&quot;    Although Mr. Bush voted for landmark gun-control legislation in Congress after the assassinations of the Rev. Martin Luther King and Sen. Robert Kennedy in 1968, he is a life member of the National Rifle Association. The Bush campaign is reminding Westerners that Mr. Dukakis, who has taken pains to reassure hunters that he supports their right to own guns for recreation, nonetheless supported a 1976 referendum that would have forced Massachusetts residents to turn in their handguns.    &quot;If someone in the West is looking for one reason to oppose Dukakis, this is it,&quot; says Democratic Rep. Richard Stallings of Idaho.    Now that his campaign is focusing on the West, Mr. Dukakis is hurrying to bring his positions into line with Western sentiment on such questions as opening oldgrowth forests to the timber industry.    The Dukakis campaign originally issued a position paper pledging to &quot;take immediate measures to protect old-growth forests.&quot; That's a standard impulse for an Eastern politician looking for the environmentalist vote. But it's a position that Patrick McCormick, prominent in Oregon Democratic circles, says &quot;makes people out here less willing to take a risk with a Democrat.&quot; Last week, the governor's Oregon campaign director, Anne Day, backed off, issuing a statement saying Mr. Dukakis isn't and never has been a supporter of a ban on harvesting old-growth timber.    The two non-contiguous Western states are expected to split, with Hawaii going Democratic and Alaska Republican. The Democrats hope a ballot question to make English the official language of Colorado will spur a big turnout in that state. But former Democratic Gov. Richard Lamm cautions that it would &quot;take a political earthquake for the Democrats to take Colorado.&quot;    Elsewhere, Democrats are counting on resentment over the Reagan administration's handling of the summer's big forest fires in the West and worries about the mining and farming industries to help Mr. Dukakis carry Montana, where Democratic polls now give him an edge.    But their greatest hopes are in the Pacific Northwest. Mr. Dukakis won the Democratic primaries in Washington and Oregon, and Washington was the only state where Pat Robertson recorded a clear GOP primary victory, handing Mr. Bush his only defeat on Super Tuesday.    Both candidates have made several visits to the area. But Mr. Bush's campaign stop at Northwest Marine Iron Works in Portland, Ore., this month was an enormous embarrassment, with workers confronting him over low wages and chanting that he is a &quot;union-buster.&quot;    The Democrats also appear to have the organizational edge. In Oregon, Ms. Day has hired 21 paid staff members, opened seven state offices, formed steering committees in all 36 counties and enlisted 500 precinct captains. In Washington, the Dukakis state director, Susan Jacobson, also has hired 21 paid staff members and has opened four regional offices, including one in Snohomish County.    &quot;I'd guess their monthly overhead is larger than twice our entire budget from the convention to the election,&quot; says Michael McKay, vice chairman of Mr. Bush's campaign here. &quot;We've got a real fight on our hands this time.&quot;    ---         Western States: Elusive Targets for Democrats                                             Last Time                             Electoral         Voted    State                      Votes         Democratic    California*                 47              1964    Washington*                 10              1968    Colorado*                    8              1964    Arizona                      7              1948    Oregon*                      7              1964    New Mexico*                  5              1964    Utah                         5              1964    Hawaii*                      4              1980    Idaho                        4              1964    Montana*                     4              1964    Nevada                       4              1964    Wyoming                      3              1964    Alaska                       3              1964    TOTAL ELECTORAL            111   *Indicates states where Democrats are considered competitive</TEXT></DOC>
