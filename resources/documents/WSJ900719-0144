Dingell Assails Air Force on Decision   By U.S. Not to Pursue Northrop Lawsuit   ----   By Rick Wartzman   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/19/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12</SO><CO>   NOC FREST</CO><IN>AEROSPACE (ARO)</IN><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)</GV><LP>   A congressional panel charged that a Justice Departmentdecision not to pursue civil charges against Northrop Corp.for alleged B-2 Stealth bomber mischarges stemmed from afinding that &quot;the Air Force was fully aware that Northrop'sreports were false&quot; but did nothing about it.   Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the Housesubcommittee on oversight and investigations, asserted in aletter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that the Air Force&quot;abandoned its fiduciary responsibilities to protect theinterests of the taxpayers while making the single largestinvestment in a weapons system in this country's history.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Separately, Northrop confirmed it lost a South Koreanarbitrator's decision in a dispute over a $6,250,000 paymentit made to some Seoul businessmen. The company said it willappeal the decision by the Korean Commercial ArbitrationBoard. Northrop, which said it's pursuing other attempts torecover the money, insists the money was earmarked for ahotel venture and that the company was bilked out of all ofit.   Mr. Dingell's investigators and two federal grand juries,though, are trying to determine whether Northrop executivesinstead intended the money as a bribe so that Koreanofficials would buy F-20 jet fighters, in violation of theU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The company and itsexecutives, including Chairman Thomas V. Jones, deny anywrongdoing.   Both the B-2 and F-20 controversies are sure to surfaceduring a Dingell subcommittee hearing, possibly this month,into Northrop's business activities.   Citing a 1988 memorandum prepared by Howard Daniels, civildivision chief of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles,Mr. Dingell noted that the Justice Department concluded thatNorthrop &quot;did, in fact, present inaccurate cost andscheduling data . . . and earned-value estimates&quot; on theStealth bomber project. The Daniels memo called Northrop'sscheduling system &quot;essentially a farce.&quot;   Mr. Dingell's staff said the government attorney's memo,still unreleased by the Justice Department, didn't allege theamount of the overcharging. A private lawsuit brought byseveral former employees contends the fraud totaled more than$20 billion.   A Northrop spokesman in Los Angeles and an Air Forcespokesman both declined to comment; Mr. Daniels couldn't bereached for comment.   The allegations of B-2 mischarges first were raised twoyears ago by some former Northrop managers and auditors.Under the federal False Claims Act, the U.S. reviewswhistle-blower cases to decide if it wants to join as aco-plaintiff.   &quot;Just because the government knows of fraud does noteliminate its obligation to take action against it,&quot; saidHerbert Hafif, a Claremont, Calif., attorney representing thewhistle-blowers.   In his letter, Mr. Dingell asked Mr. Cheney to &quot;convene acourt of inquiry&quot; analyzing the Justice Department findings.   The Daniels memo, according to the congressman, said thatwhile some whistle-blower allegations were essentiallyaccurate, &quot;the Air Force has known of these facts for sometime but has chosen to take no remedial action.&quot; The memosaid: &quot;Accordingly, there is no provable fraud because thereis no detrimental reliance on false representations.&quot;   Noting that the memo claimed only two government auditorswere checking on the B-2 through the early 1980s, Mr. Dingellfumed: &quot;That breaks down to about $10 billion per auditor.Using that ratio, we could oversee the entire $300 billiondefense budget with 30 auditors.&quot; He called the situation&quot;nothing short of criminally negligent,&quot; adding that the memosuggests &quot;a conspiracy between the Air Force and Northrop tomislead&quot; the defense secretary and Congress on a &quot;petprogram&quot; carrying a $65 billion-plus price tag. He called theconcerns &quot;cause enough to terminate this program.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
