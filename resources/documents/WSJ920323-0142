Reebok had told the SEC that it didn't plan to letshareholders vote on the proposal for &quot;Creation of anIndependent Compensation Committee,&quot; by the New York CityEmployees Retirement System.</LP><TEXT>   However, John Brosseau, special counsel of the SEC'sdivision of corporate finance, wrote: &quot;In view of thewidespread public debate concerning executive compensation .. . proposals relating to senior executive compensation nolonger can be considered matters relating to ordinarybusiness.&quot; Ordinary business isn't subject to shareholdervotes at annual meetings.   The New York Retirement System, which held 166,928 Reebokshares when it made the proposal last fall, has $20 billionin pension funds. Its proposal calls for restricting thecompensation committee to board members who aren't paid byReebok except as board members, don't work for it orsignificant suppliers or customers, and other conditions.   John P. Douglas, Reebok's vice president and generalcounsel, said the only part of the rule that would affectcurrent members of Reebok's compensation committee is onethat says members can't be in the final year of their threeyear terms as director. He said Reebok directors willrecommend shareholders turn down the proposal.   Reebok Chairman Paul Fireman had been routinely rankedamong the nation's best paid executives, averaging $13.6million a year from 1985 to 1990 under a unique pact thatpaid him $357,200 in salary plus 5% of the amount by whichReebok's pretax earnings topped $20 million.   However, in 1990, Reebok rewrote his contract to give him$1 million in salary and up to $1 million in bonuses a year.Oddly, some compensation experts then said this action mightlead to a slowdown in the salary surge nationally. Mostcompensation crtics agree that executive salaries have kepton rising.</TEXT></DOC>
