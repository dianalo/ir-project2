Dorfman</HL><DD> 11/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   Suddenly, it seems as if everything has changed.    After one of the most potent and prolonged stock-market rallies, the bear reappeared last month with a vengeance. It was bad enough that the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged a record 508.00 points in one hectic trading session that wiped out $500 billion of stock market value. But the gyrations and economic uncertainty since then have left many of us uneasy about our personal financial plans.    &quot;The shock effects we've had are off the Richter scale,&quot; says David Dreman, managing director of Dreman Value Management, a New York money management firm. &quot;We've got to have some secondary shocks to come.&quot;    Facing such extreme volatility and anxiety, it can be hard to know what to do. Some investment professionals see gleaming bargains. Others warn of the risks of more big losses if the market plunges again -- or slow torture if stock prices decline slowly as the economy slides into recession.    Unfortunately, it isn't possible to duck the issue. True, making no moves at all could be the smart move for some, at least until the markets settle down. But simply avoiding decisions about the best -- and worst -- places to put one's money is really making a decision by default.    There really is no getting around it. Turbulence and uncertainty notwithstanding, you've got to buckle down and make some tough choices -- not just about buying or selling specific stocks, but also about your short-term and long-term financial goals, how much risk you're willing to take to achieve them and how to deploy your investment funds among the alternatives.    William Harnisch, president of Forstmann Leff Associates, says that by moving assets with perfect timing among stocks, bonds and cash on a quarterly basis, investors could have tripled their return in the past 15 years. No one can always time the markets just right, of course. But &quot;you have a lot of room to make mistakes&quot; and still come out ahead, Mr. Harnisch says. &quot;If you go back over the years, you find that no one of those sectors -- cash, bonds or stocks -- outperforms (the others) for more than a couple of quarters&quot; except in rare instances.    In times like these, it's natural to look to the past for guidance. The table labeled &quot;What to Buy When&quot; looks at how 10 types of investments fared during periods of economic boom, recession, high inflation or low inflation. Although the lessons of history aren't always clear-cut, seeing how certain investments have performed under various economic conditions could be a reference point when reviewing one's long-term investment strategy.    As the table shows, stocks generally outperformed other investments under most conditions. But stocks were one of the worst places to be during times of high inflation.    The 17% average gain in stock prices during recessions is usually the result of a &quot;V&quot; pattern movement. Stock prices generally decline before a recession hits and during its early stages. Around the middle of a recession, stock prices typically start to rise, economists and investment professionals say. That's because stock investors try to gauge the conditions that lie around the next bend, making the stock market a leading indicator, one that often anticipates economic trends.    Gold, silver and diamonds all shone when inflation was high. However, they had poor to average performances under most conditions.    Treasury bills, predictably, provided a steady but modest return. The same was true, on average, for home prices, although the averages conceal fairly sharp year-to-year variations.    While the results for commercial real estate also look fairly steady, such figures have been kept for only a relatively short period. Of course, real estate, unlike most investments, is heavily influenced by local market conditions.    In evaluating different investments, a vital consideration is the trade-off between risk and reward. How much of the former are you willing to accept to get how much of the latter? And how do you really know what to expect? Although it's generally accepted that investments with the potential for an unusually high return involve a greater risk of loss, it doesn't necessarily follow that a risky investment will be a rewarding one.    For this special report, 25 financial experts were asked to assess the risks of a wide variety of investments, on a scale from 1 (very safe) to 5 (very risky). Their average judgment about each investment is shown in the table headed &quot;What's Risky, What's Safe?&quot; The panel consisted of 15 financial planners and 10 other investment professionals, chosen to represent a variety of investing perspectives.    On some investments, the panelists were almost unanimous. Nearly everyone hailed Treasury bills as safe; all hands allowed that race-horse ownership is risky. But the panelists reached no consensus on some other investments, notably gold, silver, diamonds and put options. For each of those investments, every possible risk grade, from 1 to 5, was picked.    The 25 experts were surveyed by questionnaire last August, when the stock market was near its peak. In late October, we telephoned them to see if they wanted to change their answers. Few did; the overall results hardly budged. Clearly, it takes more than the emergence of a nasty bear from hibernation to make most financial experts change their basic views on investing.    But the stock market crash has refocused attention on the virtues of diversification. True, a diversified portfolio won't match the results of one or two spectacularly good investments. But it's safer because the risks are spread out, avoiding lopsided holdings of a single type of asset -- say, stocks or real estate -- that could dive in a crash. And the results aren't generally that bad, either.    Bailard, Biehl andamp; Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., money management firm, is one of the best-known advocates of a diversified approach to investing. Larry Biehl, a director and co-founder of the firm, says he recommends a fixed mix of assets for individual investors who like to buy and hold for the long term: 20% in money market funds, 20% in long-term Treasury bonds, 20% in U.S. common stocks, 20% in foreign stocks and 20% in real estate investment trusts.    A mix of that type, he says, has provided a 10.4% average annual return for the past 19 years. &quot;It is darned hard over time to beat the fixed mix,&quot; he says.    John Bogle, chairman of the Vanguard Group of mutual funds, agrees. &quot;Anybody's ability to predict the stock and bond market is essentially zero,&quot; he declares. &quot;People tend to be optimistic at tops and pessimistic at bottoms.&quot;    Mr. Bogle says individuals should keep a fixed percentage of their assets in stocks -- perhaps 75% for young people, 35% for retirement-age investors -- and just ride out the fluctuations.    For those with &quot;greed in their vocabulary&quot; who just can't resist trying for extra return by making more frequent changes in their investment mix, Mr. Biehl currently suggests this blend: 15% cash, 33% bonds (high-grade corporates and Treasurys), 9% international bonds, 16% U.S. stocks, 10% international stocks, 5% precious metals and 12% real estate.    Achieving a truly diversified portfolio -- one that contains both a mix of investment types and a variety of investments within each category -- can require several hundred thousand dollars if you buy individual stocks, bonds and other investments. But people without such ample resources can get instant diversification through various types of mutual funds and similar investment vehicles such as real estate investment trusts.    One professional investor who is still putting his chips on stocks is Mr. Dreman. &quot;The worst thing to do is to sell your stocks at the height of a panic,&quot; he says.    Indeed, Mr. Dreman believes this can be a good time to add selectively to one's portfolio. &quot;We're seeing values now which are really values we would have bought before the bull market began,&quot; he says. &quot;If some of the first-rate growth stocks fall below the market multiple (that is, the average ratio of price per share to company earnings per share), we might buy in, and sell something that's not as exciting.&quot;    Charles Kroll, publisher and author of the newsletter Diversified Investor's Forecast, represents the other extreme. He thinks stocks should now be avoided like the plague. &quot;I expect a recession, followed by a depression,&quot; says Mr. Kroll, a former financial planner whose newsletter is read in large part by other planners. &quot;I'm 90% convinced that Oct. 19 was a true market crash ending the bull market that began in 1982.&quot;    Mr. Kroll reduced the percentage of stocks in his model portfolio to 12.5% from 25% in July, and to zero in early October. He would keep most assets in cash equivalents such as bank accounts and money market funds for at least the next few months, he says.    Connie Moak Mazur, a partner at Glickenhaus andamp; Co., is calmer: She thinks that the 1987 crash will prove to resemble the 25% stock market slide of 1962. That one didn't lead to a recession; in fact, the country &quot;went on to some good prosperity,&quot; she notes.    Ms. Mazur suggests that individuals stick with a 50-50 blend of municipal bonds and stocks. &quot;Munis provide income and some security,&quot; she says. &quot;Over the long haul, stocks are where you're going to make money.&quot;    Several of the money managers agree with Fredric E. Russell, a Tulsa, Okla., money manager, that investors who do venture back into the stock market now should emphasize companies' balance sheets, and avoid debt-laden firms. Mr. Russell's late-October blend was about 50% stocks, 25% bonds and 25% cash. On the bonds, he's sticking to those with high safety ratings and maturities of three years or less.    There's also wide support for the view that consumer stocks should be avoided for the time being, in case frightened consumers clamp their wallets shut and precipitate a recession. Most of the managers say they aren't sure whether a recession is coming, but won't be surprised if one does. Says Kenneth S. Hackel, president of Systematic Financial Management Inc.: &quot;The stock market has already discounted a normal recession.&quot;    ---   Mr. Dorfman reports on personal finance and investing from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.    ---   The 25 individuals listed below provided evaluations of the riskiness of various investments and other information for this special issue.
