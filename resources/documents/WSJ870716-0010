The brokers are Philip Buswell, formerly of the Manchester, N.H., office of E.F. Hutton and Co.; David Drozda, formerly of Hutton's Omaha, Neb., office; Michael Frazin, a former CBOE member; and Charles E. Safford, formerly of the New Orleans office of PaineWebber Inc.    All four men agreed to the sanctions without admitting that exchange rules were violated. None of the four men could be reached.    The penalties were determined by the exchange's business conduct committee.    Mr. Buswell was permanently barred from the exchange. The CBOE alleged that he misappropriated funds and made false statements to customers.    Mr. Drozda was suspended from the exchange for one year. The exchange alleged that he signed a dead man's name to several Hutton forms and made several unauthorized transactions from a customer's account.    Mr. Frazin was fined $10,000 and suspended from the exchange for 30 days. The CBOE alleged that he misreported various transactions to the exchange's price reporting system.    Mr. Safford was suspended from associating with any exchange member for five business days. The exchange alleged that he made numerous transactions without prior approval of the registered options principal, the options supervisor in a PaineWebber branch office. </TEXT></DOC>
