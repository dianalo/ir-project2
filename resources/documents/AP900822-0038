The huge crowd on Tuesday overflowed Wenceslas Square indowntown Prague, the site of confrontations 22 years ago betweenSoviet tanks and weeping, angry Czechoslovaks who pelted them withrocks and garbage.   The Aug. 21, 1968 military intervention crushed the PragueSpring reform movement that tried to introduce Communism with ahuman face.   Havel, the dissident playwright catapulted to the presidency byNovember's peaceful democratic upheaval, cautioned the crowd thatreform remains unfinished.   ``It is the burdensome heritage of the totalitarian system thatwe haven't yet come to grips with,'' he said. ``In many communitieshuge bureaucratic monsters continue to rule.''   But Soviet tanks no longer back them, he said, adding:   ``We will have only ourselves to blame if we allow them tooverpower us. It is necessary for all the people to put their nosesto the grindstone. We've lost 20 years, and we cannot afford tolose another single day.''   Havel's comments concentrated on the future, blasting what hecalled the Communist legacy: inefficiency, corruption anddilettantism that he said threatened Czechoslovakia's buddingdemocracy.   Tuesday's observances marked the first free commemoration of theinvasion anniversary.   Last year, before Czechoslovakia's hard-line Communist leaderswere ousted, riot police waded into thousands of people whogathered in Wenceslas Square to remember the Soviet-led invasionand to demand reform.   The official CTK news agency estimated the crowd fillingWenceslas Square on Tuesday at 100,000.   It was believed to be the largest gathering there sinceNovember's revolution when hundreds of thousands of Czechoslovakscrowded the square repeatedly to press their demands fordemocratization.   Those demonstrations culminated in the toppling of Communistrule and led to democratic elections in June in which Havel's CzechCivic Forum political movement and its Slovak counterpart, PublicAgainst Violence, won a parliamentary majority.   Alexander Dubcek, the reformist Communist Party leader whospearheaded the Prague Spring movement, also addressed the crowd.   Dubcek, who emerged from years in oblivion to become speaker ofthe freely elected Parliament, was greeted with chants of ``LongLive Dubcek!'' as he spoke.   Bulgaria's premier, Andrei Lukanov, told state TV: ``As a nationand as a party we must be ashamed of ourselves for taking part inthe events in Czechoslovakia in 1968.''   The Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies who participated in theinvasion now condemn it.   Although a normal working day, much of Tuesday was given over toobserving the invasion's 22nd anniversary.   At daybreak, costumed members of the ``Jester Society'' studentgroup swarmed through subway stations in a mock invasion of thecity.   Also Tuesday, Mayor Jaroslav Koran made seven Soviets honorarycitizens of Prague. The seven were arrested after they staged ademonstration in Moscow protesting the invasion shortly afterWarsaw Pact troops moved into Czechoslovakia.   Koran also formally stripped the honorary citizenship of Sovietdictator Josef Stalin; Klement Gottwald, Czechoslovakia's firstCommunist president, and Gustav Husak, the Communist Party leaderinstalled by Moscow after the invasion.</TEXT></DOC>
