TANKS is a sophisticated software systemdesigned to assist in the decisionmaking process regarding tank managementstrategies. TANKS can address important questions. What should be donewith current tanks? What are the best leak detection and other managementoptions for these tanks, and when should they be replaced? What typesof tank systems should be installed when a new or replacement tank isneeded: What leak detection is best for the selected system? What arethe priorities for replacement and leak testing? What are the risks andcosts of delaying action? How large are the savings associated with improvementsin strategy? How much are risks reduced? Management options that canbe assessed include: double-walled tanks and other forms of secondarycontainment, combinations of leak detection methods, aboveground tanks,tank repair or relining, testing of cathodic protection, and maximumtank age policies. 110 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
