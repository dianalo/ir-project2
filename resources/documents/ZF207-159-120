 Word processing has come to be the processing ofwords and graphics within a document.andP;  A drive toward multivendorenvironments and various hardware platforms has forced theindustry toward common standards for file sharing such as DigitalEquipment Corp's Compound Document Architecture.andP;

said JeffWeidler, vice president of marketing and sales for word processing vendorMarc Software International.andP;  &quot;Word processing has redefined itself.&quot;andM;SOME LIKE IT SIMPLEandM;In contrast, makers of basic packages have generally chosen to keep thingssimple.andP;  Instead of bundling in electronic publishing features, they havemade their packages act as front ends to more sophisticated publishingsystems.andM;Nonetheless, sophisticated and simple packages alike continue to beintegrated with graphics, spreadsheet and database management software.andP;  Theability to integrate word processors with DEC's All-in-1 office automationproduct is becoming increasingly common.andP;  And what-you-see-is-what-you-get(WYSIWYG) formats are now the rule.andM;The drive toward multivendor, integrated environments has boosted interest inUnix products and cross-platform document sharing.andP;  During the past year,both Marc Software and WordPerfect have introduced Unix versions of theirword processing packages.andP;  DEC announced its Compound Document Architecture(CDA), which is designed to let users share files across multiple hardwareplatforms.andM;Vendors are beginning to pay more attention to another little-known butimportant standard called CALS (Computer-Aided Acquisitions and LogisticsSupport).andM;By 1991, CALS adherence will be required on all word processing packages usedby companies doing business with the federal government.andM;A handful of products--including DEC's WPS-Plus, Microsystems EngineeringCorp.'s (MEC's) Mass-11, WordPerfect's WordPerfect and Data ProcessingDesign's Word-11--continue to dominate DEC word processing sales.andP;  Most ofthe new product and feature announcements during the past year came fromthese big players.andM;DEC's WPS-Plus still has the largest installed base at VAX sites, either as astandalone product or as part of DEC's All-in-1 office automation system,according to Computer Intelligence, a La Jolla, Calif.-based market researchcompany.andP;  DEC has made no significant product announcements over the pastyear, though new word processing products are thought to be underdevelopment.andM;DEC has made no significant changes to WPS-Plus, but the company's new CDAmay have profound implications for DEC word processor users.andM;CDA provides an open, integrated architecture intended to let DEC usersexchange compound documents across multiple platforms, including VAX/VMS,Ultrix, MSDOS, OS/2 and Apple Macintosh systems.andP;  According to DEC, CDA willallow users to integrate data from a variety of applications--wordprocessing, spreadsheet, graphics and database mangement system (DBMS)packages, for example--into compound documents.andM;CDA is designed to be compatible with both PostScript and internationalstandards, including the International Standards Organization's (ISO's) OpenSystems Interconnect (OSI) model and Office Document Architecture/OfficeDocument Interchange Format (ODA/ODIF).andM;According to Ronni Marshak, editor in chief of the Office Computing Reportfrom the Patricia Seybold Office Computing Group in Boston, interchangestandards are going to be important for word processor applications.andP;  Shepredicts that CDA will become a de facto standard.andP;  &quot;The internationalstandard is ODA,&quot; she said, and &quot;Digital's CDA complies with ODA, but is muchricher.&quot;andM;DEC does not yet have a word processing product that is compatible with CDA,but Marshak said she expects that the company will eventually release astate-of-the-art offering.andM;CDA has already received the support of some key third-party vendors.andP;  Amongthem are MEC, Apple Computer, Eastman-Kodak, Polygen of Waltham, Mass., andOdesta of Northbrook, Ill., as well as desktop publishing bigwigs aldus ofSeattle and Interleaf of Cambridge, Mass.andM;MANY TO CHOOSE FROMandM;Of all the big word processing vendors that have introduced productsrecently, probably the busiest has been MEC.andP;  Over the past year, the companyhas announced a software bridge, a drawing program and version 8.0 of itspopular Mass-11 word processor.andM;MEC's SuperCom, a communications software bridge, provides seamless,bidirectional document transfer between VAXes and PCs for Mass-11 users.andM;Files can be transferred in batch or background mode, in ASCII mode, or in abinary mode that can transfer MacDraw or MacDraft executables.andP;  SuperCom forPCs is priced at $195; a separate module, ranging in price from $995 to$2.875, is necessary for VAX hosts.andM;The newest version of Mass-11 features on-screen text and graphics previewcapabilities for the VAXstation 2000.andP;  Also featured are multiple zoomingcapability and font sizes and a WYSIWYG capability that lets users previewwhat their documents will look like before they're printed out, a companyspokesman said.andM;Version 8.0 also includes a new thesaurus and a new macro facility thatallows as many as 30,300 sequences.andP;  Graphics integrated with Mass-11documents can be stored separately from the text rather than be embedded init.andM;Mass-11 Draw for the VAXstation 2000 provides freehand-sketchingcapabilities.andP;  A mouse is used like a stylus to create and edit drawings.andO;The Mass-11 Draw program also provides interactive editing of text tostretch, pull-down or pull-up words, and it provides 100 shades of black, sixlevels of zooming, and the ability to scan in and edit pictures or photos.andM;MEC Corporate Communications Manager Carol Karels considers word processors abackbone application that should have links to &quot;peripheral&quot; applications likegraphics and spreadsheets.andP;  &quot;We can link up with multiple databases,&quot; shesaid.andP;  &quot;Graphics processors can pull in graphics from almost anywhere andtranslate them into [Mass-11] documents.&quot;andM;WordPerfect also had a busy year.andP;  In October, the company announced version4.2 of WordPerfect, which not only runs on VMS, but also on DEC's Ultrix-32systems and Unix 386 systems from Altos Computer Systems of San Jose, Calif.andM;The vendor also announced plans to port WordPerfect Office, an officeautomation package, to Unix this year.andM;WordPerfect's latest version offers what the company's executives describedas having &quot;75 percent of [all available] desktop publishing features.&quot;andP;  Theseinclude enhanced graphics, PostScript support, automatic kerning, adjustableleading and as many as 250 fonts (depending on printer capability), accordingto a WordPerfect spokesman.andP;  &quot;This is just a natural evolution&quot; of wordprocessing, he said.andM;Data Processing Design's newest Word-11 release lets users printidentical-looking fonts regardless of whether they're sending documents toDEC LN03, Talaris, HP LaserJet or any PostScript-compatible printers.andP;  Othernew features include multiple document editing capability, support forscientific characters and VMS Mail links.andM;Marc Software introduced an Ultrix version of its WordMarc Composer+ wordprocessing package that includes support for version 11.3 of MIT's X WindowSystem, which was released in December.andM;Candy Burbridge, a Marc Software marketing manager, said, &quot;Providing Xwindows is really a step toward supporting an industry-standard operatingenvironment that's becoming more critical every day, with more people jumpingon the [X windows] bandwagon.&quot;andM;WordMarc's new features include mouse support, enhanced scientific typingcapabilities, and support for color displays and alternate characters.andM;In addition, the company announced that an interface to All-in-1 for WordMarcCompose+ would be available this spring.andP;  The interface will range in pricefrom $1,250 for Micro VAXes to $9,500 for high-end VAXes.andM;MANY BUSINESS DEALSandM;Several companies have moved to strengthen their positions in theDEC-compatible word processor industry through marketing alliances.andM;For example, Saturn Systems has taken over U.S.andP;  distribution of and supportfor the Lex word processing and office automation package from EEC Systems inSudbury, Mass.andP;  The package is now available from Saturn as Saturn-Lex.andP;  Lexis manufactured by Ace Microsystems of Kew Bridge, Midlesex, England.andM;According to Mary Kuntsmann, Saturn Systems' communications manager, Saturnhas also signed a joint development agreement with Ace Microsystems.andM;The two companies have announced an integrated graphics and word processingpackage for VAXes, PDPs and Unix platforms--Saturn-Lex version 9C--which isat test sites now and which is scheduled to be announced for general sale byJanuary.andM;&quot;Saturn still has its own package called Saturn-WP,&quot; Kuntsmann said, &quot;butwe're phasing it out over the next two years.andP;  We'll be building what'simportant in it into Saturn-Lex.&quot;andM;Saturn's Saturn-Calc and Saturn-Graph--spreadsheet and graphics packages,respectively--are available separately now but will be available as integralcomponents of the new version of Saturn-Lex, Kuntsmann said.andM;&quot;It's the kind of thing people expect from their PC products--to be able toflip back and forth between two or three modules,&quot; Kuntsmann said.andP;  &quot;AtSaturn, I also work on documentation, and it's something we could use a lot,to draw graphs in the middle of [word processing] files.&quot;andM;The new version will also feature redlining, pull-down menus, an interactivethe-saurus and spelling checker, a box-drawing capability, RMS file access,PostScript support, a menu-designing facility, proportional spacing andon-line help via pop-up menus.andM;Saturn also recently struck a deal with relational database supplierInteractive Technology Inc. (ITI) of Beaverton, Ore.andP;  Under the jointmarketing and development agreement, Saturn will replace its Saturn-Basedatabase offering with ITI's RDM database management package.andP;  At the sametime, ITI will market Saturn-Lex, Saturn-Calc and Saturn-Graph with RDM.andM;Another key trend that continued this year was the integration of wordprocessing packages with other applications.andP;  Interestingly, some keyannouncements came not from word processing vendors, but from makers of otherapplications.andM;Access Technology of Natick, Mass., for example, unveiled its WP Connection,which Mass-11, WordPerfect, WordMarc and WPS-Plus users can use to exchangefiles with Access' 20/20 spreadsheet without ever leaving the word processingor 20/20 session.andM;Vendors still differ about what constitutes true WYSIWYG word processorperformance.andP;  According to Seybold's Marshak, most VAX packages have stillnot reached the ideal: &quot;It's really most often WYSIWYNG--what you see is whatyou nearly get.&quot;andP;  She noted, however, that oftentimes that's enough.andM;&quot;You only need an approximate font,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;You don't need to see itexactly on screen.andP;  You wouldn't know exactly how it would look, but wouldknow things like position, hyphenation and line endings.&quot;andM;Colin Finlay, vice president of marketing and sales at Data ProcessingDesign, said limitations beyond the word processing vendor's control candetract from true WYSIWYG presentation.andP;  &quot;We're limited by what our customersare using, which are mostly character-oriented terminals,&quot; Finlay said.andO;&quot;There's no way to display a 24-point font on a VT220.&quot;andM;OUT OF MANY, ONEandM;Many word processing vendors continue to offer packages that run in a varietyof other hardware environments, including IBM's PCs and PS/2s, and Apple'sMacintoshes.andM;The packages are generally designed so that users can read documents createdon any of the hardware platforms.andM;The biggest advantage to this approach, vendors say, is that it letsorganizations standardize on one word processing package.andP;  Thus, they don'thave to spend extra time and money training people on different wordprocessing packages.andM;For example, Marc Sotfware's WordMarc runs on VAX, Unix, MS-DOS, Prime, Sun,Hewlett-Packard and other systems.andP;  According to Marc Software's Weidler,each operating system version is identical and documents are &quot;100 percenttransportable&quot; between any of the supported hardware platforms.andM;WordPerfect also runs on a variety of operating systems.andP;  &quot;You can't beeverything to everybody,&quot; Seybold's Marshak said, &quot;but WordPerfect hassuccessfully spanned DOS to OS/2, Mac, Unix, VS and VMS.&quot;andM;According to Lauren Horton, DEC's marketing managerfor document processing,DEC sees two distinct word processing environments.andP;  &quot;The VT and PC are oneenvironment,&quot; she said, and &quot;the workstation is another.andP;  We intend toaddress both markets, with WPS-Plus for the first environment and DECwritefor the other.&quot;andM;Another product introduction designed to increase cross-platform documentsharing came from Odesta.andM;The Odesta Document Management System is a series of modules that allowsusers to organize, track and retrieve documents--including those createdusing a VAX word processor--whether generated from a Macintosh or a DECterminal.andM;&quot;This offers VAX services to Mac users that haven't really been providedbefore--for instance, the ability to integrate documents on the Mac withdocuments from other places, such as WPS-Plus or Mass-11,&quot; Odesta PresidentDaniel Cheifetz said.andP;  &quot;What we're trying to put out there is the concept ofa document server,&quot; he explained.andM;Special utilities intended for use with VAX and other word processingpackages are continuing to emerge.andP;  For example, the DEX Document ExchangeSystem 3.03 from Systems Compatibility of Chicago, and the Keypak EditableDocument Exchange from Keywork Office Technologies of Calgary, Alberta, areVAX/VMS office automation systems that let VAX users convert documentsbetween different word processing systems, both VAX- and microcomputer-based,and retain all function or format codes in the source document.andM;Despite the attention given to word processing sophistication, many vendorsof DEC-compatible word processing packages believe most users don't wantdesktop publishing features.andP;  These vendors' approach is to provide wordprocessing essentials.andP;  If users want, they can link packages with electronicpublishing systems.andP;  Data Processing Design's Word-11, for example, can belinked with Aldus' PageMaker.andP;  Also among the backers of thisseparate-but-integral approach is DEC.andM;At the far extreme of those who prefer simplicity are DEC purists likeprogrammers, engineers, scientists, technical writers, professors andstudents.andP;  Fans of barebones text editors say that such tools are cheap,functional and fine for simple tasks like producing memos, lists, softwarecodes and reports.andM;But others see text editors EDT and EVE and DEC's Runoff document processingutility as archaic.andP;  To these buyers, it makes more sense to use one of themany good third-party word processors available.andM;BUYER'S TIPSandM;1 Decide whether you need word processing software that offers just thebasics or more sophisticated electronic publishing features.andM;2 Select a package available in compatible PC versions if you need toexchange word processing documents with personal computers.andM;3 Plan for growth.andP;  Buyers contemplating significant expansion may need wordprocessors that run on Unix and Ultrix as well as on VAX/VMS operatingsystems.andM;4 Look for word processors that can be integrated with applications such asspreadsheet, database management system and graphics packages as well asDEC's All-in-1..andM;5 Be wary of WYSIWYG.andP;  Features differ from product to product, so it's wiseto comparison-shop.andM;6 Make sure the word processor you purchase supports both your present andyour planned terminals and printers.andM;7 Look for packages offering interfaces that your users will findcomfortable.andM;What's in a wordandM;Processing PackageandM;As VAX word processors gain more features and become more sophisticated, thelines between &quot;word processing,&quot; &quot;document processing,&quot; &quot;electronicpublishing&quot; and other related categories are becoming less clear.andM;Creative Strategic Research International, a computer industry research andconsulting company in Santa Clara, Calif., offers a helpful method ofdistinguishing between the various types of document processing.andP;  Accordingto the company:andM;&quot;word processing&quot; refers to software used to prepared, edit, store anddistribute simple documents like letters, memoranda and reports.andP;  Wordprocessors are most often used in business environments.andM;&quot;Document processing&quot; is one step higher in sophistication.andP;  Such softwarecan handle documents that are larger and more complex than can typical wordprocessors.andM;&quot;Desktop publishing&quot; leaps beyond word processing and document processing,allowing users to include sophisticated graphics and granting them greatercontrol over page layouts.andP;  Most often, desktop publishing programs run onmicrocomputers or single-user workstations.andM;&quot;Dedicated publishing&quot; refers to specialized systems designed to producelarge documents in volume.andM;Most often used by large corporations, dedicated publishing systems requirebig CPU workhorses and an array of related software, so they involve asignificantly greater financial commitment than desktop publishing packages.andM;Entire departments are often devoted to managing such publishing systems.andM;Last but not least, &quot;commercial publishing&quot; systems are used to create itemssuch as manuals and books, usually in large volumes.andP;  At this level, thetypical users are big companies or publishers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
