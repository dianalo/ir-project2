Some EastEuropean officials have even explored the unlikely prospectof membership, senior Western officials say.   Hungarian, Polish and Czechoslovakian leaders will meettoday in Visegrad, Hungary, to discuss how to separatethemselves from Moscow militarily and guard against againfalling under outside domination. It is the first suchtrilateral meeting.</LP><TEXT>   It follows a proposal this week from Soviet PresidentMikhail Gorbachev to disband the Warsaw Pact's militarystructures April 1, after which the alliance would continueas a political organization. Mr. Gorbachev's proposal hasleft unresolved the question of how former Soviet militaryallies would provide for security in the future.   At first, many East Europeans believed the best solutionwas to create new structures under the umbrella of the34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.However, East European leaders are increasingly skepticalthat the CSCE can fill that role. They particularly point tofutility of the CSCE's recent condemnation of Soviet use offorce in the Baltics.   Czechoslovakia's President Vaclav Havel, who was one ofthe most outspoken proponents of the CSCE, said this weekthat NATO is Europe's &quot;only functioning democratic securitystructure.&quot; Mr. Havel recognizes that membership is still faroff, but he agreed during meetings this week with a visitingNATO delegation that Czechoslovakia and the alliance wouldexpand exchanges of information and military observers.   And yesterday, Romanian Foreign Minister Adrian Nastasesaid his country is interested in an associate membership inNATO. He said the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact was disintegrating,leaving its members with no security guarantees.   Hans Binnendijk, of the International Institute forStrategic Studies, says the Eastern European nations &quot;areslowly leaning westward. What each of these countries has inmind is to slowly make inroads in the West and live in theprotective shadow of NATO.&quot;   Senior NATO officials, however, warn East Europeans thatany formal relationship would be premature. They tell EastEuropean colleagues that expanding the alliance now wouldonly further isolate Moscow and feed the growing strength ofKremlin hard-liners. For now, say senior NATO officials, EastEuropean countries must be satisfied with closer politicalcontacts and a series of exchanges that range from observerstatus at NATO plenary and assembly sessions to more than 250scholarships each year for postgraduate studies of democraticstructures.   &quot;What we can offer them is an expanding cooperative andconsultative arrangements,&quot; says one senior NATO official.&quot;What we can't offer is military integration. No one believesthat would further security in Europe now or help achieve ourgoal of bringing the Soviet Union out of its shell and makeit feel unthreatened.&quot; He says Moscow was so nervous aboutNATO's borders being moved to the Polish border throughGerman unification that a further move of NATO eastward wouldtrigger alarm.   But East European leaders argue to their NATO counterpartsthat the Soviet Union is isolating itself through its newhard line and lack of economic reform. Mr. Binnendijk warnsthat NATO shouldn't make &quot;gray area commitments&quot; to EasternEurope that can be misinterpreted.   Nevertheless, Moscow is increasingly left without Europeanallies, a predicament best illustrated by the increasingtestiness of troop withdrawal negotiations with its WarsawPact partners. Moscow has promised to remove its remaining14,000 troops from Hungary and 18,000 from Czechslovakia bythis summer.   East European governments have demanded reparations forecological damage left by departing troops, and the Sovietsare demanding huge sums for buildings and militaryinstallations they are leaving behind. Hungarian officialsfear that the Soviets may stop withdrawing troops until theypay a huge bill Moscow has presented.   &quot;There isn't an amicable agreement anywhere,&quot; says DouglasL. Clarke of the Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty ResearchInstitute in Munich. &quot;The Soviets have given indications thatthey may slow down their withdrawal and play hardball.&quot;   The most acrimonious talks are with Poland, where theSoviets insist on keeping the bulk of their 48,000 troopsstationed there until it has completed its withdrawal of338,000 troops from former East Germany by 1994. Polishofficials, however, have refused to allow Soviet troops topass through during their withdrawal from eastern Germany.The Poles are demanding more money from Moscow for thethousands of trains and trucks that must pass through. Theyalso want promises that all 48,000 Soviet troops in Polandwill be out by mid-1991.   Yet the Poles last summer had been the least willing todisband the Warsaw Pact and send Moscow's troops home, whichit had viewed as security against a resurgent Germany. Nowthat Germany has signed an agreement recognizing theOder-Neisse line as the permanent border between the twocountries, Poland has shifted its focus to creating an armedneutrality similar to that of Sweden's.   The Poles have become the strongest advocates of forming aregional alliance with Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Yet anysuch formal agreement is unlikely in Visegrad. Hungary won'tmake any decision that it fears would endanger futuremembership of NATO.   For its part, NATO has increasingly included EastEuropeans in its consultations. The six major Warsaw Pactcountries all now have ambassadors to NATO in Brussels.   East European officials have also explored alternativearms-supply possibilities with NATO members. They fear asituation where they receive all their weaponry from thecountry they consider their greatest threat. But they lackthe money to buy Western weaponry and convert the outmodedSoviet systems that Moscow provided them.   For now, it appears, East European countries will have toexist in a security-structure vacuum, where the Warsaw Pacthas disappeared but nothing has taken its place. &quot;The EastEuropeans are going to be very nervous over the next fewyears while they are in this strategic limbo,&quot; says Mr.Binnendijk.</TEXT></DOC>
