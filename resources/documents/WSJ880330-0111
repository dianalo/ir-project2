Bishop (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GNE BECHY ABT </CO><IN> PHA </IN><DATELINE> ATLANTA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Heart attack victims treated with the blood clot dissolver streptokinase and aspirin had a 40% lower death rate than patients receiving conventional treatment, directors of a major international clinical trial reported.    The trial, involving 17,000 patients rushed to hospitals with heart attacks, also found that the clot dissolver reduced the risk of death even if used as long as 24 hours after the heart attack began. Heretofore, it was thought clot dissolvers had to be used within four hours or so after the first symptoms of a heart attack to be effective.    The new report, delivered at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology, is the latest of several recent reports on the use of the clot dissolvers to stop a heart attack before it inflicts fatal damage. On the commercial front, the reports are harbingers of a major marketing battle shaping up between makers of the clot dissolvers.    Streptokinase, one of the oldest of the clot dissolvers, is produced and sold by various units of Hoechst A.G., the big West German drug and chemical company. Since late last year, another clot dissolver, genetically engineered tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), has been sold by Genentech Inc., San Francisco, under the trade name Activase. Beecham Group PLC, the big British drug maker, is in the final stages of testing still another clot dissolver, Eminase. A fourth clot dissolver, urokinase, is sold by Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, under the name Abbokinase.    In the big trial reported here yesterday, researchers said that doctors at 400 hospitals around the world gave about a fourth of the 17,000 heart attack patients infusions of streptokinase as soon as they reached the hospital after a heart attack. These patients also received the equivalent of half an aspirin tablet daily. At the end of five weeks only 7.8% of these patients had died.    By comparison, 12.8% of an equal number of patients who received placebo infusions and tablets were dead at the end of five weeks. Overall, those receiving both streptokinase and aspirin had a 39% lower death rate, according to Rory Collins of the University of Oxford in England, coordinator of the Second International Study of Infarct Survival.    If the treatments were begun within the first four hours after the heart attack the death rate was as much as 60% lower than in those patients receiving placebos, Dr. Collins said. Equally important, he added, even those patients treated six to 24 hours after a heart attack began had a 20% to 30% lower death rate, an unexpected finding.    The streptokinase and the aspirin each had an independent effect on survival, Dr. Collins said. The one-fourth of the patients who received streptokinase only had a death rate about a third lower than those on placebos. The one-fourth of the patients who received aspirin only had a death rate about a quarter lower than those on placebos.    The surviving patients have been followed as long as 33 months after their heart attacks, and the lower death rate in the treated patients is persisting, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
