SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Saudi Arabia has signed an agreement topurchase 315 of the Army's most advanced tanks in a deal worth morethan $3 billion, the Pentagon announced Monday.   The M-1A2 tank, the most up-to-date version of the Abrams, theArmy's main battle tank, is manufactured by the Lands SystemsDivision of General Dynamics Corp.   The tanks are scheduled for delivery from 1993 through 1995.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, citing lessening chances for U.S.involvement in a major European land war, had proposed terminatingthe M-1 tank program in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.   The Saudi deal means that the nation's tank production lines, atplants in Lima, Ohio, and Warren, Mich., will not be shutting down.   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., applauded the arrangement as ``goodnews for Michigan and for the nation.''   Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, said the Saudi order alone isn'tenough to prevent scheduled cutbacks at the two plants, but willenable the United States to offer lower prices for tank sales toother countries.   The $3 billion agreement includes support equipment, spareparts, training, munitions and the construction of maintenancefacilities, the Pentagon said in a statement.   The M-1A2 version is outfitted with a 120mm gun and toughenedarmor to protect it against Soviet-produced antitank weaponssystems.   It also features special viewers for the gunner and tankcommander that will allow each to seek out targets in the dark.   The systems are separate from one another, enabling the gunnerto shoot at one target while the commander seeks out the next one.   Congress was told last year that the deal was pending. Bushadministration officials have said that United States would ensurethat Israel maintains a qualitative edge over Arab armed forces.   Oxley said the Saudis wanted to tanks to patrol their borderwith Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
