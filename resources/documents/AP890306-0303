The airline said it would retainits most profitable routes _ the Northeast shuttle and three flightsweekly between Miami and Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Santiago,Chile.   Using managers and workers who crossed picket lines, Easternmanaged to fly about one-third of its 62 shuttle flights between NewYork and Boston and Washington. Snow in New York hampered servicefurther. Supervisors de-iced planes, loaded baggage and worked asflight attendants. Planes that did leave were delayed by up to fivehours. Few non-shuttle flights made it into the air.</TEXT><NOTE>PILOTS:</NOTE><TEXT>   Eastern filed a motion in federal court in Miami against thepilots. The airline said the pilots' walkout was illegal and askedU.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis to force them back to work.   The pilots, who argue they are not striking but merely honoringMachinists' picket lines, said they were studying the managementmotion and were not surprised by it.   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell blamed the pilots for theshutdown. ``The pilots are conducting their own economic strikeagainst the company,'' he said. The 41,000-member Air Line PilotsAssociation reiterated a pledge to begin a job action at dawnTuesday that could delay every flight in the country.</TEXT><NOTE>PICKETS:</NOTE><TEXT>   Machinists and supporters picketed Eastern terminals. No problemswere reported Monday. The Machinists' strike was joined by mostEastern flight attendants and pilots.   In New York, former Screen Actors Guild president Ed Asner joinedpicketers, calling Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo one of the``corporate raiders who take what they can get and leave behind thedesiccated hulls of the companies.''   In Atlanta, the Rev. Jesse Jackson urged Eastern to giveemployees a chance to buy the failing airline and try to save itfrom bankruptcy. ``If Lorenzo can't fly it, let the workers buyit,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>NEGOTIATIONS:</NOTE><TEXT>   None scheduled. The last talks were Friday; they failed toproduce an agreement, and the Machinists union strike began at 12:01a.m. EST Saturday.</TEXT><NOTE>RAILROADS:</NOTE><TEXT>   U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson issued a temporaryrestraining order Monday against secondary picketing at Amtrak.   The judge on Sunday issued a similar order against three majorrail lines that carry 320,000 commuters daily between New York Cityand New Jersey, Long Island and northern suburbs.   Nine other commuter railroads nationwide and Amtrak had beenpotential targets of sympathy actions. But the Machinists union saidit decided to appeal Patterson's orders and did not set up picketlines at railroads Monday. A hearing was scheduled on both rulingsWednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
