MITI's role in the Japanese economy has long been the subject of debate. But if its power has sometimes been overstated, MITI nonetheless plays a crucial role in several respects.    MITI and other Japanese agencies fund research that's a long way from commercialization -- and therefore involves extraordinary risk. One example is biocomputing, where MITI organized a project in 1986. The research is coordinated by government, but the work is done by government, university and industry labs.    One of the more far-fetched biocomputing projects uses living substances in electronics -- a biochip. &quot;This idea has been bombarded like Dresden and Berlin during the war,&quot; says Michio Sugi, a section chief at the Electrotechnical Laboratory of MITI. &quot;But there's a building to be constructed on the ruins.&quot;    MITI can also invoke the needs of the Japanese nation, a powerful weapon. Its influence is such that Japanese Randamp;D executives say there's nothing better to bring to a budget meeting than a document showing that MITI has targeted a field as a national priority.    MITI is neither infallible nor all powerful. Back in the 1950s, the forerunner of Sony Corp. fought MITI bureaucrats, who at first tried to stop the company from buying the rights to the transistor, developed at Bell Laboratories. In later years, Honda Motor and other upstart auto makers successfully resisted MITI's plan to slim down the Japanese auto industry.    Some Japanese firms may quarrel with MITI, but most still show plenty of fear and respect. &quot;In MITI, if an assistant section chief makes a phone call to the corporation asking for some information, immediately the president of the company rushes to the agency to report,&quot; says Noboru Makino, chairman of Mitsubishi Research Institute. This sort of stepping and fetching stirs resentment.    Nonetheless, over the years MITI-sponsored projects have yielded superb results, including some unexpected ones.    One of the largest Japanese-government-sponsored projects of the 1970s was the $125 million Pattern Information Processing Systems, or PIPS project. The goal was to develop a machine that could read the Chinese characters used in the Japanese language. This is fantastically difficult, since each person's handwriting is slightly different, and Japanese companies are still struggling to develop equipment for the commercial market.    But the byproducts of the PIPS project have been widely acclaimed for stimulating the development of the bar-code scanner, the technology of machine vision in robots and thermal heads for printers.    The kind of cooperative research sponsored by MITI has brought about calls for an &quot;industrial policy&quot; by some policy makers and intellectuals in the U.S. No serious attempt to create an American version of MITI has been tried as yet. One notable step in this direction is Texas-based Sematech, a joint government-industry effort to regain competitiveness in the semiconductor-manufacturing business. </TEXT></DOC>
