The male refugees, ages 15 to 40, were hiding in the jungle inthis border area after fleeing their homes in Myawaddy village inBurma.   The refugees said government troops surrounded their villageFriday and led off males to haul artillery and mortar shells fortroops fighting ethnic minority rebels along the border. Thaiauthorities confirmed their report.   The Burmese are launching a major offensive against the ethnicKaren, who field the strongest force among a dozen ethnic minorityrebel groups seeking greater autonomy from the central government inRangoon.   That government has been sharply criticized in the past by humanrights groups, including the London-based Amnesty International, forforcing villagers and Rangoon residents to do forced labor underallegedly inhuman conditions.   Burmese interviewed by The Associated Press last year said theyescaped from troops who had forcibly taken them from Rangoon tocarry heavy loads of equipment without pay. They said they weregiven very little food and water.   Maung Tun, a 40-year-old Burmese merchant among the latestrefugees, said the Burmese troops had seized 200 men in the villageWednesday for forced labor. He said some villagers decided to fleeto other places inside Burma and to Thailand when the troopsreturned to take more people Friday.   Maung Hla, 28, quoted a Burmese soldier as saying troops werealso recruiting villagers to build a road to Kler Day, a former campof ethnic Karen insurgents. Burmese troops seized the camp on Jan.14.</TEXT></DOC>
