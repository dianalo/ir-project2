rocket called the MacintoshIIfx.andP;  With configurations available for just under $10,000, it is the mostcostly--but by far the fastest--Mac available to date.andP;  The IIfx goes a longway toward addressing the needs of high-end users who had hit a wall inperformance with previous-generation Macs.andP;  Therefore, it should stempotential defections to the Sun Sparcstation or the Silicon Graphics PersonalIris, both of which have moved down into the Mac's price range.andM;At the same time, Apple is hoping the IIfx will defuse the threat posed byfast '386 and '486 PCs.andP;  At the product launch, it provided to the press abevy of independent tests that attempt to show that the $10,000 Mac IIfxdelivers considerably better price/performance than similarly configuredmachines from IBM and Compaq.andP;  With the impending release of Windows 3.0,which is already attracting Mac application developers in droves, this &quot;PepsiChallenge&quot;-style comparison might give pause to would-be defectors from theranks of developers and users alike.andM;Of course, PC buyers have a choice of machines from manufacturers other thanIBM and Compaq, with many offering equal or superior performance for muchlower costs.andP;  So Apple's price comparisons are somewhat misleading, and theyignore one of the PC world's greatest strengths: competition.andM;RISC-based graphics coprocessor.andP;  Apple also made several otherannouncements.andP;  It is replacing all existing Macintosh display cards but onewith three new models--one of which, the Macintosh Display Card 8.24 GC,employs an AMD 29000 RISC coprocessor to speed up QuickDraw routines 30times.andP;  It released a new version of its A/UX operating system, whichincorporates the complete Macintosh desktop as well as X Window supportwithin ATandamp;T's Unix System V.2.2 (with BSD 4.3 extensions).andP;  And to top it alloff, it announced the Extended Keyboard II ($229).andM;Brave new world.andP;  It was appropriate that Apple announce these products atthe NCGA conference, since this venue attracts the pocket-protector crowdthat Apple desperately wants to keep in the Macintosh camp.andP;  And there is nodenying that a fully loaded IIfx, equipped with the 8.24 GC displaycontroller and a 19&quot; gray-scale or color screen, and running A/UX 2.0,delivers considerably more bang for the buck than do most Unix workstations.andM;But at what price?andP;  With the IIfx, Apple has introduced its thirdprocessor-direct slot architecture in as many machines.andP;  The machine's memoryis based on a new SIMM form factor that, although offering higherperformance, will mean higher memory prices for users because of theirproprietary nature.andP;  To support the new hardware, a new release of the Systemsoftware (6.0.5) is required, the installation of which has already proven inour shop to be like walking through a mine field--you never know what willblow up next.andP;  Most incredible of all, the IIfx has a new SCSI cableterminator that will require users to disconnect all existing SCSIterminators in disk drives and scanners to for use with this machine!andP;  Thesedevices will then have to be reconverted for use with older Macs.andP;  It'salmost as if each new Macintosh represents a new product line, consisting ofitself and only itself.andM;High performanceandM;It has been reported that the IIfx is the product of a new development teamat Apple, one recruited from the workstation world.andP;  It is also said that theIIfx is Apple's &quot;Next killer,&quot; since it incorporates many of the sameinnovations that its founder has built into his black cube.andM;The IIfx achieves its performance by cranking up a 68030 to 40 MHz andmarrying it with a 40-MHz 68882 math coprocessor.andP;  It also incorporatesseveral other innovations designed to squeeze the maximum performancepossible from the hardware and to make power users salivate.andP;  We would havebene more impressed with a 68040-based offering at this price, but Appleevidently is saving that chip for even bigger and better (and more expensive)things later this year.andM;A faster memory subsystem.andP;  Apple has added 32k of zero-wait-state,25-nanosecond static RAM cache and a latched-write design within the memorysubsystem to increase the speed with which the processor retrieves, reads andwrites information.andP;  The new latched-write capability allows the 68030 toread information from the cache as previous computational results are storedto memory.andP;  Apple claims to achieve a 95% cache-hit rate on read requests.andM;The IIfx also comes with a minimum of 4 MB of 80-ns DRAM, packaged inproprietary 64-pin SIMMs that provide a full 64-bit-wide memory path forparallel address and data transfers.andP;  Only Apple-supplied SIMMs or those madeby third parties expressly for the IIfx will work in the IIfx.andP;  Electrically,these are the same SIMM form factors as those used in the LaserWrite IIseries, so there should be some incentive for third parties to tool up tomake these modules.andP;  Nevertheless, Mac users who have gotten used to thefalling price of memory will have a rude shock when they go to upgrade thismachine.andM;Apple has also upgraded the IIfx's ROM to 512 KB of 32-bit clean ROM that isinstalled as a ROM SIMM.andP;  This will make future system upgrades easier, sincethe capacity of SIMM ROMs can vary substantially.andP;  As with the IIci, a paritymemory option will be available &quot;for a small additional fee,&quot; and has to bespecified when the system is ordered.andP;  This approach has never made sense tous.andP;  Why not just build it into every system?andM;An intelligent I/O subsystem.andP;  Borrowing a page from the Next cube, Appleemploys two I/O processors (basically, Apple IIc's on a chip) dedicated tocontrolling various I/O activities, such as serial communications, floppydisk access and Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) processes.andP;  Each of these operationspreviously used some of the CPU's bandwidth.andP;  In addition, a new SCSI DMAcontroller is employed to further accelerate system performance.andM;We predicted when Steve Jobs introduced the Next machine that his competitorswould eventually copy many of his innovations.andP;  Although I/O controllertechnology has been around since the earliest days of the microprocessor (thelittle-heralded 8089 was designed as a dedicated I/O coprocessor for the 8086family, for example), it wasn't until Steve Jobs used it that the rest of theindustry put I/O and DMA subsystems on its list of must-have enhancements.andM;Processor-direct slots.andP;  The wonderful thing about Apple's bus architectureis that there are so many of them.andP;  There's the processor-direct slot (PDS)on the SE/30, the NuBus, the several bus types on the Portable, the cacheaccess slot on the IIci--and now the processor-direct slot on the IIfx.andO;Described as a &quot;superset&quot; of the SE/30's PDS, the IIfx's slot is designed tolet developers have direct access to the 68030's internal bus.andP;  Apple expectsthird parties to develop enhancements such as special communication, videoand coprocessor cards.andM;But realistically, how many different bus designs can the Macintosh support?andO;The PC world, which is many times the size of the Macintosh installed base,has been having epic clashes over two basic designs: IBM's Micro ChannelArchitecture and the so-called &quot;classic&quot; AT bus, which has been extended byCompaq and others into a 32-bit superset known as EISA.andM;Will you see dozens of third-party products for each of the Apple busarchitectures?andP;  Aside from the NuBus, which is standard on all Mac IIs, wethink not.andM;System 6.0.5.andP;  Apple introduced a new enhancement to the operating system forthe IIfx, version 6.0.5 (not the 6.1.5 printed on the disks--evidently atypo).andP;  System 6.0.5 provides support for the IIfx, the Macintosh DisplayCard 8.24 and 8 .andP;  24 GC, and &quot;third-party software products that require6.0.5.&quot;andP;  (There are currently none that we know of.)andP;  In additional, Applerecommends using 6.0.5 on the IIci and the Portable as well as with 32-bitQuickDraw applications.andM;Apple claims that the new release will run virtually every existingapplication.andP;  Right.andP;  As time goes along, we have discovered each new Applesystem release to be very machine specific.andP;  We now run only System 6.0.2 onour Mac IIs, and 6.0.3 with the IIcx and SE/30.andP;  Ignoring this rule of thumbis a risk, because with each new release something invariably breaks.andP;  Whenone of us switched to a IIci with 6.0.4, we knocked him off our network forseveral months until 3Com and other third-party developers could figure outhow to fix their device drivers.andM;For the record, System 6.0.5 corrects problems on both the Portable and theIIci associated with previous releases of the system, and it enhances 32-bitQuickDraw by adding more dithering capabilities, support forvariable-resolution PICT images, and storage of font information in PICTimages.andM;Connectivity.andP;  As with every Macintosh introduced since the product familywas launched via the infamous &quot;Big Brother&quot; Super Bowl ad in 1984, the IIfxcomes equipped with a serial port and built-in LocalTalk.andP;  We can understandApple's attachment to this low-cost networking topology it invented, butgiven the intended market for this machine, we think that the omission of abuilt-in thin Ethernet adapter is inexcusable.andP;  Given that Ethertalk is awell-defined standard and that thin Ethernet has become standard on everylow-end Unix workstation from the Next cube on up, Apple is long overdue inproviding this capability.andP;  Please, Apple, by the time you introduce your68040-equipped models, make thin Ethernet a standard option.andP;  As it is, usingthe IIfx with its built-in LocalTalk over a network is like driving aMaserati on a set of four flat tires.andM;Configurations.andP;  Apple is offering the IIfx in three basic configurations.andO;All three come with 4 MB of Super-SIMM memory, the operating system andmanuals.andP;  The entry-level model, which has an internal floppy diskSuperDrive, lists for $8,969.andP;  The next model up, which comes with an 80-MBhard drive, will sell for $9,869.andP;  And the top-of-the-line version comes witha 160-MB hard disk and lists for $10,969.andP;  Additional memory is available in4-MB chunks for $999.andM;Upgrades.andP;  Apple is also offering the IIfx as an upgrade option to Mac II andIIx users.andP;  For $2,999 you get the IIfx logic board, System 6.0.5., HyperCard1.2.5 and manuals.andP;  You do not get the precious IIfx SIMMs, which have to bepurchased separately from an authorized Apple dealer.andP;  Be certain to removeall of your existing SIMMs if you want to reuse them in other machines (theywon't work in the IIfx) before turning your system over to a dealer for theupgrade, because you won't get them back otherwise.andM;Macintosh Display CardsandM;Previously, Apple offered a Chinese-menu assortment of display optionsconsisting of seven separate cards.andP;  Six of these have been replaced by threecards, two of which are variations on the same theme.andP;  Only the entry-levelmonochrome card has been retained.andM;Graphics has always been one of the Macintosh's principal strengths.andP;  Itmarries sophisticated graphics capabilities with the ease of installation andconfiguration that is the envy of PC and workstation users everywhere.andM;What was lacking before was consistency; the new products provide consistencyin spades.andP;  Each card can be used with any of Apple's monitor products.andO;Multiple cards can be used simultaneously in a single Mac, creating a&quot;virtual canvas&quot; that allows an application developer to use each to displaypart of a single screen or image, much like the matrix TV displays at the LasVegas airport's arrival lounge.andM;The new Macintosh display card product line consists of three models:andM;* Macintosh Display Card 4.8.andP;  This bread-and-butter model displays images in8-bit mode (256 grays or colors) on Apple's 12&quot; monochrome and 13&quot; colormonitors, or in 4-bit mode (16 gray levels) on the larger Portrait Display orTwo-Page Monochrome Monitors.andP;  The 4.8 can be upgraded to support &quot;true&quot;color and gray scale, similar to the 8 .andP;  24, via a video-RAM upgrade kit.andO;The basic card costs $648, and the VRAM upgrade kit $349.andP;  Both will beavailable this summer.andM;* Macintosh Display Card 8.24.andP;  Apple's entry into the 24-bit colorsweepstakes, this card provides access to 16.7 million colors on the 13&quot;color monitor and 256 gray levels on the portrait and two-page displays.andO;Additionally, the 8.24 card supports Apple convolution, a process thatprovides flicker-free images on interlaced devices such as televisions andvideo recorders.andP;  This is an important feature for use in creating multimediapresentations, since it allows the easy integration of high-quality imageswith other media.andP;  (You will need an additional third-party converter box toconvert the interlaced signals generated by the Macintosh controller card toNTSC or PAL television signals.)andP;  The 8.24 is available immediately.andP;  Itlists for $899.andM;* Macintosh Display Card 8.24 GC.andP;  This is by far the most interesting of thenew graphics products, and one that will help make the IIci and IIfxcompelling platforms for high-end color and engineering work.andP;  The 8.24 GCincorporates all of the features of the 8.24 and, according to Apple, boostsgraphics performance by as much as 30 times.andP;  This increase in speed in dueto the inclusion of two new technologies:andM;--Risc coprocessor.andP;  The GC card accelerates all graphics routines throughthe use of a dedicated AMD 29000 RISC processor running at 30 MHz.andP;  The 29000offloads much of the graphics processing from the system's main processor.andM;--QuickDraw acceleration.andP;  The GC card comes with a single software file thatcontains a version of QuickDraw optimized for a coprocessed environment,thereby accelerating the entire imaging model.andP;  And since this card iscompletely programmable on the microcode level, improved versions of theQuickDraw routines can be delivered to users on disk.andP;  The GC card can beupgraded to 2 MB of on-board DRAM, which will improve performance ofanimations, 3-D rendering, etc.andP;  The 8.24 GC will be available this summerfor $1,999.andP;  The DRAM upgrade kit will be available at about the same timefor $499.andM;Concurrent with the Apple announcement, SuperMac Technology announced 21&quot;monochrome and color monitors that can be driven by the Apple cards.andP;  Note,however, that even when equipped with the accelerator, the 24-bit Applecontrollers support full 24-bit color only on the smaller 640 X 480-pixelscreens.andP;  They will driver larger color displays such as the 21&quot; SuperMacscreen only in 8-bit (256-color) mode.andP;  Apple still does not sell productsfor users who want to work with full 24-bit color images on a large screen.andO;For this you will still have to buy third-party screens, such as the two-pagecolor displays from Radius and SuperMac.andM;A/UX 2.0andM;Our trials and tribulations with Unix have been well documented in thesepages over the last few years.andP;  We have long felt that Unix had the operatingsystem functionality that the PC industry was aiming for.andP;  what it lacked wasa user interface that mortals could use.andM;When A/UX was announced in March 1987, we immediately started thinking that aMacintosh front end to Unix would be a fabulous product.andP;  In essence, itwould combine a powerful multitasking operating system with a great userinterface.andP;  Indeed, we had argued with Apple that Unix should become themultitasking operating system for the Macintosh--as long as Apple preservedthe Macintosh toolbox.andM;Back-door os.andP;  But this was not to be.andP;  Apple originally developed A/UX soMacs.andP;  could get on the government buy lists, which dictated compliance withUnix.andP;  In essence, the early A/UX was strictly a back-door strategy.andP;  Sure,Apple claimed that it was developing an A/UX with the Mac front end, but itwasn't very high in development priority.andP;  Indeed, the A/UX with a Mac userinterface has just been announced, three years after its initialintroduction--an eternity in this business.andM;While the product will not actually be released for another few months (Appleis being vague on the exact release date), we have had the opportunity on twooccasions to play with it, and for the most part we are impressed.andM;User interface.andP;  Just as we imagined years ago, A/UX 2.0 is nearlyindistinguishable from the normal Macintosh finder.andP;  Applications and fileswork within the familiar point-and-click interface.andP;  It is a thrill to seeMac, Unix and X Window applications all on the screen at once.andM;The Unix interface has been modified to make it more accessible in a numberof ways.andP;  For instance, inserting a floppy disk into the machine brings up adialog box asking the user to specify whether the disk should be mounted as aUnix, Macintosh or DOS disk (the high-density floppy drive included with allMacintoshes capable of running A/UX can read DOS and A/UX disks).andP;  A featurecalled Commando allows the user to specify all the various options for Unixcommands via a dialog box rather than having to memorize all of the commandmodifier options.andM;Multitasking.andP;  The way that A/UX juggles the Mac and Unix is singular.andO;Basically, the Mac OS is run as a Unix task within a MultiFinder-lookinginterface.andP;  The Mac OS and Unix run concurrently with true multitasking.andP;  Macapplications can run under Unix, provided they are &quot;32-bit clean.&quot;andP;  (Thiswill also be required by System 7.)andP;  An older program can be run under theMac OS.andP;  However, MultiFinder apparently is incompatible with Unix'spreemptive multitasking.andP;  Consequently A/UX 2.0 is not the next-generationmultitasking Mac operating system, but it is fairly neat all the same.andM;Whether Mac window or Unix, full cut-and-paste functionality is preserved.andO;It warmed our hearts to be able to open a Unix file with Microsoft Word, usethat program's rich text processing, then save it back as a Unix file.andO;Anyone who has worked with the Unix text editor vi would appreciate this.andM;The bottom line.andP;  We are anxious to get A/UX 2.0 in our office.andP;  We alreadyhave a Next cube and a Sun Sparcstation 1, and we can't wait to sit down andanalyze the different approaches to these graphical user interfaces for Unix.andO;Then all we will have to do is find a good use for Unix in its many flavors.andM;.  .  .What price innovation?andM;It has long been evident to Apple's management that it risked losing itspower users to the hot new Unix workstations and PCs unless it could offer aproduct that delivered the performance these people crave.andP;  The MacintoshIIfx, along with the 8 .andP;  24 GC display card and A/UX 2.0, provideseverything these users have been looking for except big-screen 24-bit color.andO;Its perceived performance is better than that of a workstation, particularlywhen you take into account all the overhead imposed by Unix, X Window, OpenLook and/or Motif.andP;  With the Mac System alone it is a screamer, and as a Unixbox it gives better than average performance.andM;All of this will help keep users within the Apple family, since they can havewithin their organizations a wide range of compatible machines with differentcompute power and price points, all running a (more or less) commonapplication software base and an identical user interface.andM;But at what price has this innovation come?andP;  We have already enumerated the&quot;gotchas&quot; and incompatibilities--some small, some not so small--that haveplagued each recent system release.andP;  Moreover, each new model, as attractiveas it is in its own right, leads us to wonder if the Apple hardwaredevelopers of different products ever talk to each other.andM;Different strokes by different folks.andP;  This state of affairs may beinevitable in a company where products are developed by different engineeringgroups, each of which appears to be striving to maximize the efficiency ofits own given product with little or no concern as to how that product fitsinto the product line in general.andM;We are not prima donnas; we realize that over time certain architectures willhave to be abandoned so that the line can evolve.andP;  But this process must becarefully managed.andP;  Someone has to look at the problem, decide what newarchitectures should be developed and make sure that all new products in thepipeline use them.andP;  In short Apple needs to think in terms of offering aproduct family, with common architectural elements across a wide variety ofsystems.andM;First, do away the myriad bus architectures and settle on one for allmachines.andP;  We suggest NuBus plus a single common processor-direct slot.andO;Second, invent the hardware to run the software, not the other way around.andO;IBM or Compaq would be roasted alive in the trade press if each new PCshipped required a different version of DOS or OS/2.andP;  Third, innovate in aplanned, evolutionary way.andP;  Not every new product release needs to representa walk on the wild side.andP;  Consistency and conformity is OK, especially if itprovides users with a seamless, hassle-free upgrade path within a specificrange.andP;  You shouldn't have to gut all of your existing SCSI devices, forexample, to take advantage of increased performance.andM;Apple has been taking a lot of lumps lately from all around the computingindustry, and we hate to be thought of as just another set of analystsheaping on the criticism.andP;  Bill Joy of Sun once remarked that Apple is likeeverybody's grandmother--no matter what it does, you can't quite bringyourself to criticize it the way you would Sun or IBM.andP;  It appears now as ifsome of Apple's Teflon is beginning to wear thin.andM;But the reality is that the incompatibilities we are talking about poseserious problems for Macintosh users, for third-party software developersand, especially, for companies trying to develop add-on hardware thatenhances the Macintosh.andP;  The truth is, with each subsequent Macintosh that isput on the market, it becomes harder and harder simply to plug newer modelsinto the existing network.andP;  Plug and play, which used to be the hallmark ofthe Apple line, is quickly becoming a thing of the past.andP;  Pretty soon, theonly compatibility that we will see from Mac to Mac is the user interface!andM;P.S.andP;  The day before this article went to press, we took our IIfx out of thebox, plugged an E-machines large monitor into it, and turned it on.andP;  Itdidn't work.andP;  So now we have to contact E-machines, and then try it out withour network card and software, and then fire up our favorite applications.andO;Maybe, just maybe, they will work.andP;  Then again, they might not.andM;It's the uncertainty, more than anything, that defines the gap that hasarisen between what Apple promises and what it delivers.andP;  if that gap growstoo big, we might all be reading of further Troubles in Cupertino before toolong.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
