Temperature curves for outside, core andinside insulation are presented as well as for monolithic constructionand high K-values. Further information concerns thermal bridges and surfacetemperatures. Furthermore, information is given on humidity (condensationof damp air, surface condensation and K-values, partial aqueous pressure),and estimations, in terms of construction physics, are made of six constructions(constructive consequences). In conclusion, details are given on damagecaused by dampness and its treatment (heat flow, condensation, steamdiffusion and formation of condensation). (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
