Cf-252 was discoveredin 1950 but its potential for cancer therapy was not postulated until1965. Early sporadic clinical trials were used to treat only a few patients.The recognition of its curative properties and usefulness for bulky localizedand radioresistant cancer therapy was not made until recently. In 1985,the Lexington Workshop led to a sharing of independent experiences fromthe USA, Japan, and the USSR; early trial experiences were related toneutron beam results. Localized neutron therapy using brachytherapy methodswas found effective against radioresistance and bulky tumors. However,it needed to be used properly and with full appreciation of clinicaloncology and the role of photon adjuvant therapy.</TEXT></DOC>
