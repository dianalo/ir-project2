Under the agreement, Seafirst Bank, a unit of SanFrancisco-based BankAmerica Corp., won't have to pay forremoving hazardous waste from the entire bay adjoining thesite, and any future owners of the property will also bereleased from liability for the bay's cleanup. In return, thebank will clean up the foreclosed property and willcontribute $350,000 toward cleaning up the bay, which isexpected to cost millions of dollars.</LP><TEXT>   The prepurchase agreement was hailed by creditor groupsand the bank's lawyers as an important precedent for lenderswho seek to foreclose on contaminated property. FederalSuperfund law requires &quot;owners and operators&quot; of pollutedsites to pay for cleaning them up. A federal appeals court inAtlanta has ruled financial institutions can be held liableas operators by virtue of lending money to the owners oftainted property or being able to affect hazardous wastedisposal decisions.   &quot;This arrangement was in the best interest of the borrowerand the public. The bank gets to take action on anonperforming asset. The property gets cleaned up. Hopefully,there will be more of these agreements in the future, andthey will become easier and easier,&quot; said Michele Corash, anenvironmental law partner at Morrison andamp; Foerster in SanFrancisco, who negotiated for the bank. The Department ofJustice has concurred in the agreement, she said.   John Byrne, general counsel for the American BankersAssociation, a trade group, called the EPA agreement &quot;apositive step.&quot; But he said federal legislation is necessaryin order to clarify lender liability under the Superfund law.   Several bills are pending in Congress that wouldstrengthen an existing exemption for parties that own asecurity interest in a property but don't participate in itsmanagement. The EPA itself has proposed a rule, now underreview by the Office of Management and Budget, that wouldgive bankers broader protections under Superfund.   Washington, D.C., environmental lawyer Peter Gillon of thelaw firm of Weil, Gotshal andamp; Manges, criticized the agreementas the product of &quot;a form of blackmail&quot; by the EPA. &quot;Whyshould a bank have to pay nearly half a million dollars incash to remove waste before it's even involved, when it nevereven derived any benefit from the polluting activity?&quot; heasked.   Allan Bakalian, the assistant regional counsel for the EPAin Seattle who negotiated on behalf of the agency, cautionedthat the agreement isn't a signal that the federal agencywill take this approach in all lender liability cases. Henoted that the loans on the property in question -- a formerfoundry on Commencement Bay, near Tacoma, Wash. -- wereassumed by Seafirst as part of a portfolio from another bank.The borrower had been dissolved under bankruptcy law.   &quot;This isn't something that EPA is going to be doing withall banks that hold mortgages on Superfund property. Theseagreements are too complex and involve too many resources tobe handled on an individual basis,&quot; Mr. Bakalian said.   ---   PUNITIVE DAMAGES AWARDED in maritime asbestos case.   A Cleveland jury in federal court awarded $650,000 inpunitive damages to the estate of Maurice J. Moline, amerchant seaman who died in 1988 at the age of 61 frommesothelioma, a rare form of lung cancer believed to becaused by asbestos.   Until the 1970s, merchant ships were built using asbestos.The suit alleged that 13 companies that owned ships on whichMr. Moline sailed from 1944 until 1969 knew about the healthdangers associated with asbestos and failed to warn Mr.Moline and other crew members. Among the defendants areAmerican President Lines Ltd. and Matson Navigation Co., bothbased in San Francisco.   The punitive award is believed to be the first by a juryagainst a shipping company in a maritime asbestos case andcould have implications for the more than 20,000 similarcases pending around the country, said Leonard Jaques, aDetroit admiralty lawyer who is handling the majority ofthose cases.   But Thomas O. Murphy, a Cleveland lawyer who representedthree of the defendants, said punitive damages areinappropriate because the shipping companies &quot;didn't know anymore about the dangers of asbestos than anyone else.&quot;   He said an appeals court has yet to address whetherpunitive damages are viable in maritime asbestos cases. Hesaid his clients will appeal.   ---   CHESEBROUGH-PONDS HIT with $21.5 million in damages overQ-Tips.   The award to a five-year-old child includes $20 million inpunitive damages. A circuit court jury in St. Louis foundthat the company, a unit of Unilever N.V. in Rotterdam,marketed the Q-Tips without providing safety warnings toparents or child-resistant packaging, despite of a history ofear injuries to children.   The case involved Gregory Strothkamp, a gifted boy whopoked his eardrum with a Q-Tip in 1987, permanently damaginghis inner ear. The injury affected his balance and hishearing, which plaintiff's lawyer Arthur G. Muegler Jr. ofSt. Louis contended retarded the boy's learning and reducedhis IQ.   According to evidence in the case, Chesebrough made 12billion Q-Tips a year and controlled 55% to 60% of themarket. Company studies showed that Q-Tip buyers werepredominately households with two or more children under age12.   Yet despite an average of 932 complaints of ear injuriesto children a year from 1984 through 1986, Chesebroughdeclined to add an adequate warning label or switch tochild-resistant packaging, according to the suit. Mr. Mueglersaid the company argued at trial that the injury rate tochildren was &quot;statistically insignificant&quot; compared tooverall sales.   A spokeswoman for Chesebrough said the company'sinstructions for proper use on the back of Q-Tip boxes aresufficient to warn users of potential hazards. She saidChesebrough stands behind the safety of its products and isplanning an appeal. She declined to comment on the specificsof the suit. The company's packaging is under review, shesaid.   ---   A PATENT DISPUTE over videocassette recorders is settled.   The settlement brings to an end a four-yearpatent-infringement battle over three patents sold to RefacInternational Ltd., a licensing company, by Jerome Lemelson,an inventor of a mechanisms used in many of the videocassetterecorders marketed in the U.S.   Refac, a unit of Refac Technology Development Corp. of NewYork, sued Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Sony Corp. andother Japanese and South Korean electronics companies infederal court in Newark, N.J.   Mr. Lemelson said that under the terms of the settlementsigned last week, about two dozen companies will obtainlicenses under the patents. Mr. Lemelson said the agreementalso awards him lump sum payments &quot;in the multimillion dollarrange.&quot; It isn't known if the agreement calls for anypayments to Refac. Eugene Lang, president of RefacTechnology, wasn't available to comment.   Matsushita's attorney, Morton Amster, and Sony confirmedthat the case had been settled but declined to commentfurther.</TEXT></DOC>
