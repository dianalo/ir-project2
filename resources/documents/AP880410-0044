They insisted she wasshot by an Arab.   The settlers and right-wing legislators, including some fromPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc, condemned the army forleaking details before the probe of Wednesday's clash was finished.   They demanded tough sanctions on Palestinian rioters, includingthe expulsion of stone-throwers from Israel, and called for thedestruction of every home in Beita, the West Bank village where15-year-old Tirza Porat was killed during a holiday outing lastWednesday.   Ms. Porat was killed during a clash between Arabs and Jewsoutside the town. Two Arabs also died in the melee, and 15 people,including 13 Jewish teen-agers and two Arabs, were wounded.   Israel's Supreme Court barred the army from destroying any morehomes in Beita pending an appeal from a civil rights group. Thearmy says it already has destroyed 13 homes belonging to people itsays incited last week's clash.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told a weekly Cabinet sessionSunday that an army autopsy showed Ms. Porat was apparently killedby a shot from the M-16 rifle of Romem Al Dubi, a Jewish settleraccompanying the teen-agers on their hike, Israel radio said.   Israeli media quoted the unpublished report as saying Al Dudimay have fired the fatal bullet accidentally as he struggled withthe rioters.   A senior military official confirmed the fatal bullet came fromAl Dubi's weapon. But the official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said the army had not yet determined who fired the shot.   Outraged settlers and right-wing legislators challenged thearmy's findings Sunday and accused the military of acting onpolitical motives.   Geula Cohen, a legislator from the nationalist Tehiya party,demanded Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron resign. She contendedhe based statements about the clash on Arab reports and not oninterviews with teen-agers who had accompanied Ms. Porat.   Teen-agers who went on the hike said Ms. Porat was killed not byAl Dubi's gun but by an Arab who shot her with a Soviet-madeKalachnikov rifle from a rooftop.   According to an Israel television account of the army findings,the events leading to Ms. Porat's death began when the 16 hikersfrom the Elon Moreh settlement stopped at a dry riverbed nearBeita, 10 miles south of Nablus, to eat breakfast.   There, the group was attacked from above by stone-throwingyouths from Beita, and Al Dubi fired into the air with his M-16,the TV account said.   At that point, Menachem Ilan, the group guide, told Al Dubithere was no need to fire. But Al Dubi said, ``Shut up,'' andcontinued firing, killing one Beita youth, the report said.   The Israelis continued on a route leading them to Beita, theaccount said.   When the group got to the village, according to the TV account,an Arab tried to mediate and asked Al Dubi to surrender his gun.But the settler refused.   Soon after, the mother and daughter of the Arab killed earlierhit Al Dubi with a huge rock on the head, causing him to loseconsciousness and fire ``in all directions,'' killing a second Araband wounding two others, the account said.   The TV account did not say how Ms. Porat was killed, but notedshe was struck by an M-16 bullet.   Rami Hoffman, a 17-year-old settler, and other hikers denied theTV account.   Hoffman said Al Dubi only fired near the river bed when he wasjumped by an Arab who tried to take his weapon. He and other hikerstold reporters the Arab was only slightly wounded. They could notaccount for either of the Arab deaths.   Hoffman said the group was then surrounded by about 400 Arabyouths armed with knives and axes who forced them to the village.   Ariel Avivi, another hiker, said he believed that Ms. Porat wasshot by an Arab in the village.   ``I looked up and saw an Arab man with a masked face shooting aKalachnikov from a rooftop,'' Avivi told The Associated Press. ``Iwas in front of Tirza. When I looked down, she was lying therebleeding from the head.''   Hoffman said group members were never questioned by militaryofficials about the clash. Other Elon Moreh residents, however,said an army brigadier general came to the settlement Saturdayevening and spent several hours talking to settlers.   An army spokeswoman would not comment on the settler's versionof events.   Since Palestinians began violent protests against Israeli rulein the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in early December, 141Arabs, one Israeli soldier and one Israeli civilian have beenkilled.</TEXT></DOC>
