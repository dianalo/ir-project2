In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, American Income closed at $16.375 a share, down 12.5 cents.    Bernard Rapaport, American Income chairman, last week said he was working on a buy-out proposal.    The Waco, Texas, insurance company, which markets its products through trade unions and credit unions, said any buy-out is subject to financing and board and stockholder approval.    In a leveraged buy-out, a company is taken private in a transaction financed largely through debt. The borrowing is repaid from the company's profit or through the sale of assets. </TEXT></DOC>
