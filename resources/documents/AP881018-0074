Colleagues said Allais, trained as an engineer, changed fieldsto economics after a visit to the United States during theDepression, when he saw factories idled and men out of work.   ``My motivation when I was young was an idea of being able toimprove the conditions of life, to try to find a remedy to many ofthe problems facing the world,'' Allais told a group of reporters.``That's what led me into economics. I saw it as a way of helpingpeople.''   Allais was working at his home when he received the news he hadwon.   ``It was completely unexpected. It was just mindboggling,'' hesaid.   The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize,said Allais was chosen ``for his pioneering contributions to thetheory of markets and efficient utilization of resources.''   Although little-known outside France, Allais was extremelyinfluential at home, where senior officials in key governmentministries and state-owned industries have enormous economic power.   Jacques Levy, director of the Ecole Nationale des Mines _ fromwhich Allais officially retired nine years ago, while continuinghis research and writing _ said the new laureate had a decisiveeffect on economic thinking for more than two decades.   ``He was the mentor for everyone involved in the economy inpostwar France between 1945 and 1968, all the people who were incharge of the biggest enterprises and of the state planningapparatus,'' Levy said.   Within the world of French economic thought after World War II _in which leftists and rightists agreed the state should play amajor role in the economy _ Allais established a place for relianceon market forces.   He worked on ``a system of definition of prices which wouldpermit the economy to function at its best,'' Levy said.   Allais's work provided ``a very strong base for those opposed togovernment direction of the economy,'' said Jacques Lautman,scientific director for human sciences at France's National Centerfor Scientific Research.   Allais said he hoped the Nobel Prize would allow him to continuehis work, even though he is past the official retirement age.   ``I'm happy to have the Nobel Prize to show how absurd thissituation is,'' he said. ``It's amazing that politicians think it'snormal that they should not retire, while they think it's normal topush scholars into retirement.''</TEXT></DOC>
