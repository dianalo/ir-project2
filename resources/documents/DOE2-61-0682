<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-61-0682 </DOCNO><TEXT>Coker kerosine distillate 160-270/sup 0/C was subjected to urea adduction.The product contained about 70% n-paraffins and 30% essentially terminalolefins. Effects of important process parameters on the product yieldand its olefin content were studied. Solvent methanol/fed ratio higherthan 2.0 and urea/linear hydrocarbon ratio 5.3 are necessary for gettingoptimum product yield. The adduct formation was complete in less than10 minutes at room temperature. Studies on adducts from coker middledistillates indicated that substantial quantities of C/sub 10/-C/sub18/ alpha olefins can be made available from its source.</TEXT></DOC>
