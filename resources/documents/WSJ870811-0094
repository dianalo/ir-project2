The purchase, expected to be completed later this year, would add the equivalent of more than 100 million barrels of oil to Exxon's already burgeoning reserves. The package includes nine oil fields in California and 23 oil fields off the coast of the state.    Many U.S. oil companies have been snapping up rapidly diminishing U.S. oil reserves rather than pursuing costly exploration programs. Growing uncertainty in transporting Persian Gulf crude oil &quot;could add even greater dividends to this strategy,&quot; said William Brown III, analyst for Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    The purchase has been in the works for at least seven months. Exxon first became aware of an opportunity to buy Celeron when Goodyear's investment adviser contacted Exxon late last year.    The transaction is part of Exxon's continuing program to acquire oil and gas properties. Since early 1984, Exxon has spent more than $1.5 billion to buy more than 300 million barrels of oil and gas reserves in the U.S., said Randall Meyer, president of Exxon Co. U.S.A.    Exxon recently bid to acquire Dome Petroleum Ltd., the troubled Calgary, Alberta, oil and gas company. Dome has agreed to be acquired by the Canadian unit of Amoco Corp.    Sale of the reserves also marks a major step in completing Goodyear's restructuring. An unsuccessful takeover attempt last year by Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier, sparked a massive reorganization at Goodyear, including a $2 billion stock buy-back program.    Robert Mercer, Goodyear chairman, said the company is using proceeds of the restructuring to reduce debt.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Exxon shares closed at $98.25, up $2.875. Goodyear closed at $76 a share, up $2.75 in Big Board trading.    Celeron has a work force of 30 employees, according to Exxon, which said it would keep &quot;those we need to continue operating the properties.&quot;    Celeron would increase Exxon's U.S. oil and gas reserves, which total 5.6 billion barrels, about 2%. Exxon has 13.6 years of U.S. reserves, more than any U.S.-based international oil company, said Paul Mlotok, analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. Internationally, Exxon's reserve base of 11.4 billion barrels is surpassed only by that of Royal Dutch/Shell Group.    With the purchase, Exxon will pick up an additional 17,000 barrels a day of oil and gas production from 450 wells in two oil fields in California's Kern County.    The transaction doesn't include Goodyear's All American Pipeline System, which probably will be sold to a group of companies rather than to a single entity. The 30-inch pipeline carries crude oil from offshore and onshore oil fields in California to refineries in the Gulf Coast and midcontinent areas.    Exxon's purchase of Goodyear's reserves raises the likelihood that Exxon will participate in the group that buys the Goodyear pipeline. Though a company spokesman said Exxon hasn't made an offer for the pipeline, the company wouldn't rule out interest in the system. The spokesman said &quot;plans haven't been finalized,&quot; and &quot;we intend to cooperate with (Goodyear's pipeline subsidiary) to evaluate options.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
