Under the aluminum producer's plan, a pool of funds will be created when earnings from its U.S. aluminum operations exceed a return of 6% on assets. Seventeen percent of the profits above this threshold will be placed in the pool.    Alcoa, illustrating its plan, said that if its domestic aluminum operations were to achieve the same level of profitability in the second half of this year as in the first half, the payout this year would equal about 7% of each employee's annual salary. Payments will be made by March 15, 1989, the company said.    The company offered profit sharing to its hourly workers, but the proposal was rejected by the two major unions representing some 14,000 Alcoa workers, a spokesman said.    Alcoa's plan, said Chairman Paul H. O'Neill &quot;is intended to reward employees for their part in excellent corporate financial performance, to motivate greater team performance and involvement and to make variable compensation a part of Alcoa's reward system.&quot;    Other major manufacturers with profit-sharing plans are General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Caterpillar Inc., and Deere andamp; Co. </TEXT></DOC>
