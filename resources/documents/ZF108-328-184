(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>IBM's Second Generation RISCandM;IN TRADITIONAL IBM STYLE, it was one of the industry's worst-kept secrets.andO;Many of the details of the RISC System/6000 (code-named Rios), IBM'snext-generation RISC platform, have been plastered all over the tradepublications for almost a year.andP;  By announcement time, bookies were stilltaking bets on the month in which the platform would appear.andP;  The premiere ofthe RS/6000, originally set for October, was delayed till mid-February.andP;  Thereason?andP;  Speculation has ranged from operating system problems to the lack ofapplication software.andP;  The reason was a little of both.andM;But there is another dimension to IBM's introduction of the RS/6000.andP;  Thecompany's developers were determined not to repeat past mistakes.andP;  IBM hadbeen severely humiliated by the failure of its first RISC platform, theRT/PC.andP;  Not only was the platform limited in power, but it also lacked thegraphics required for the applications IBM had targeted.andP;  In addition, IBMintroduced only workstations, not servers.andP;  When it became apparent that theindustry wanted servers as well, IBM wasn't prepared to compete withcompanies like Sun Microsystems and Apollo Computer.andM;The company that invented RISC had failed to implement it well enough tocapture any meaningful market share.andP;  IBM quickly realized that it would needa new-generation platform to compete.andP;  It started working on the RS/6000 in1986, just after the RT was released.andP;  This time, IBM was obsessive in itsdevelopment efforts.andP;  It was out to prove its workstation manhood.andM;Despite all the pre-announcement speculation, there were surprises.andP;  Thebasic information was correct.andP;  But the depth and magnitude of IBM'snew-generation RISC machine were underestimated.andP;  It offered morefloating-point performance than anyone had expected--up to 13 MFLOPS.andP;  Itexceeded expectations in areas such as graphics performance and busperformance.andP;  It also expanded the levels of support available to developers.andO;The level of activity is similar to IBM's efforts to encourage third partiesto port software to the AS/400 several years ago.andM;The RS/6000 is clearly a second-generation RISC platform.andP;  Its CMOS design issix times denser than the RT chip.andP;  The RISC System/6000 has as much as 30times faster floating-point performance than the RT, and 16 times as muchmemory.andP;  IBM's 32-bit version of the MicroChannel is 10 times faster than theRT bus.andP;  Perhaps its most important single achievement is its ability toprocess up to four instructions per cycle, made possible by theimplementation of what is called superscalar.andP;  This is a much higherperformance implementation of RISC, which allows the system to process aninstruction in a single cycle.andP;  In contrast, superscalar allows for multipleinstructions to be handled in one cycle.andM;The bottom line is that IBM has gone all out.andP;  Its goal for the RS/6000 is toestablish RISC leadership in terms of both price and performance.andP;  It isleading with exceptional floating-point performance and throughput, and IBMhas also announced optical cabling for the new systems, which adds to itsperformance and throughput.andP;  The RS/60000 leapfrogs the competition in termsof performance.andP;  This fact buffers the impact of the four-month delay in theintroduction.andP;  However, the delay did give key competitors such as Sun,Digital Equipment, MIPS, and Hewlett-Packard more time to prepare responses.andO;IBM seems to understand the challenge, and it promises to double performanceevery 12 months.andP;  To compete, it will have to keep that promise.andM;The RS/6000 FamilyandM;IBM announced the RS/6000 as a family of four workstations and five servers,and an X terminal.andP;  In the future, IBM will be providing diskless softwaresupport to lower the price of the offering.andP;  In the future, IBM will expandthe product line on the low end as well as the high end.andP;  All of the familyuses the Power (Power Optimization With Enhanced RISC) architecture.andP;  (Powerrefers to the internal CPU.)andM;All of the workstations and servers come with a minimum of 8MB of mainmemory.andP;  The maximum memory on the upper end of the spectrum is 256MB.andP;  WhenIBM begins implementing 4MB chips, all the boxes except the desktop modelwill support 512MB of memory.andP;  The desktop model will be able to expand to128MB of memory.andP;  Also included are: the internal 3.5-inch diskette, 19-inchdisplay (gray scale), color monitors in either 16, 19 or 23-inch sizes(1024x1080 megapel displays), mouse, operating system (AIX Version 3),graphical user interface (either AIXwindows based on Motif or NextStep fromNeXT), and Ethernet.andP;  MIPS performance ranges from 27.5 MIPS on theentry-level workstations to 41.1 MIPS on the high-end server.andP;  A rack-mountedserver configuration has a MIPS rating of 34.5.andP;  MFLOPS rating ranges from7.4 MFLOPS on the low-end workstation to 13 MFLOPS on the high-end server(non-rack-mounted).andM;The following is a description of the various workstations and servers.andM;XStation 120.andP;  XStation 120 (IBM's own X-station design) can be configuredwith up to 8.5MB of RAM memory, and it supports a range of displays from thePS/2 8503 monochrome display to high-performance graphics displays.andP;  Pricetag is $2,525 (with gray-scale display).andM;The Powerstation 320.andP;  The powerstation 320 is the low-end workstation.andP;  Itincludes a 20 MHz processor with 8KB of instruction cache, a 32KB data cache,and a 64-bit memory bus.andP;  It includes only two memory slots and four I/Oslots.andP;  It has a price tag of $12,995.andP;  On the low end, IBM has not touchedthe magic under $10,000 price tag that Sun Microsystems set with theSPARCstation 1.andP;  IBM's pricing is therefore a little bit higher than or onpar with its competitors', but the performance for the money is better.andP;  Inaddition, IBM is adding a one-year, on-site maintenance agreement as part ofthe package.andP;  While other vendors (including H-P and Digital) offer aone-year warranty as well, users must carry their machines to a servicecenter for repair.andP;  (Sun's warranty is 90 days).andP;  Pricing also includeshigh-quality black-and-white or color monitors.andP;  IBM may have a bit of aproblem with some VARs and OEMs; they may perceive its pricing as higher thanit actually is.andM;The Powerstation 520.andP;  The only difference between the Powerstation 520 andthe 320 is the availability of a larger internal disk (from 355MB up to2.5GB), and the number-memory and I/O slots have been expanded to eight.andO;There are 2-port optical slots built into the direct memory bus of all modelsexcept the 320.andP;  These have not been implemented yet but will be in thefuture.andP;  The price tag is $30,425.andM;The Powerstation 530.andP;  This is a full implementation of the Powerarchitecture.andP;  IBM uses a 25-MHz processor in the Powerstation 530, comparedto a 20-MHz version in the 320 and 520.andP;  This faster clock speed combinedwith the 64KB cache and 128-bit memory bandwidth (which results in a 400-Mbitper second transfer rate) translates into 34.5 MIPS and 10.9 MFLOPS.andP;  Mainmemory begins at 16MB; cost is $41,125.andM;The Powerstation 730.andP;  The Powerstation 730 is IBM's high-performancegraphics workstation.andP;  The only difference between the 730 and the 530 isgraphics capabilities.andP;  The 730 processes approximately 990K vectors persecond and 120K polygons per second.andP;  This compares to graphics on the otherworkstations of 90K vectors per second and 10K polygons per second.andP;  Itsprice is $73,815.andM;RS/6000 ServersandM;The Powerserver 320.andP;  The processor on the Powerserver 320 is the same asthat on the Powerstation 320.andP;  The difference is that the Powerserver 320 hasbeen configured with 16MB of memory rather than 8MB.andP;  No display or graphicluser interface is included since this is a server.andP;  It is intended to supportbetween 5 and 50 users.andP;  The price is $20,375.andM;The Powerserver 520.andP;  The Powerserver 520 is the same processor as used inthe Powerstation 520.andP;  It has been configured with 16MB of main memory ratherthan 8MB.andP;  No display or graphical user interface is included.andP;  It isintended to support between 25 and 150 users.andM;The Powerserver 530.andP;  The Powerserver 530 is identical to the Powerstation530, and it is priced $1,580 less than the workstation because it includes nodisplay or user interface.andM;The Powerserver 540.andP;  This is IBM's high-end server and the only one to use a30-MHz processor.andP;  Main memory starts at 64MB.andP;  It is the only model thatwill include the 4Mbit chips initially.andP;  Also, internal disk begins at 640MB.andO;Price on this machine is $92,885.andM;The Powerserver 930.andP;  The Powerserver 930 is a rack-mounted version of thePowerserver 530.andP;  Like the 530, it operates at 25 MHz, but it supports moreusers because internal disk size has been increased.andP;  The rack-mountedversion has two optical slots (each card has two ports).andP;  With the opticaltechnology, users would be able to link three floor-standing systems togetheror link five rack mounted systems.andP;  Starting disk size is 670MB to 11.9GB.andO;Price is $62,230.andM;IBM intends to provide aggressive discounts to third parties as well as toend users.andP;  For example, it will offer VARs as much as a 35-percent discount.andO;Discounts for software developers will be up to 50 percent.andP;  A developercould easily pick up a low-end Powerstation 320 for as little as $6,500.andM;Does this aggressive pricing mean that IBM will lose money?andP;  Probably not.andO;IBM is using the same manufacturing facilities and, in some instances, thesame parts used on the PS/2.andP;  The rack-mounted server uses the same racksused for the 9370 systems.andP;  IBM has also leveraged some of the technologydeveloped in its laboratories, such as the optical cabling between systems.andO;And, because IBM was able to pick up software from the various Unix vendorsand industry consortia, its costs were lower than it is accustomed tospending.andM;RISC WARS: PLAYING BY THE RULES.andP;  But, when a company is as big and ascomplex as IBM, nothing is simple.andP;  When a vendor has both its traditionalsystems offerings and Unix boxes, strategies are bound to conflict.andP;  IBMwants to be a major player in the RISC marketplace for open systems ingeneral and for workstations in particular.andP;  In this game, price/performanceis king.andP;  But any hardware leader is only king for a day.andP;  Things tend tochange so fast that it doesn't take long for a competitor to finesse theleader into a second-place finish.andP;  This is a market that IBM is not used toplaying in.andP;  In fact, it is much more analogous to the semiconductormarketplace of the late 1970s and early 1980s.andP;  In those days, the joke wasthat semiconductor makers would compete by slashing their wrists and waitingto see who would bleed to death first.andP;  This story could well be told aboutRISC hardware vendors today.andM;IBM may take some time to learn the rules of the game.andP;  But it is eager tobegin.andP;  In the traditional minicomputer and mainframe world, IBM could alwaysbe a little more expensive and get away with it.andP;  Users often looked for theIBM seal of approval and were willing to pay extra to get it.andP;  The samecannot be said of the aggressively paced workstation market, which has a verylow tolerance for games that vendors might want to play to keep theirexisting systems looking good.andP;  Having two different and competing productlines has been an agonizing struggle for IBM, but, of course, the company isnot alone here.andP;  Digital Equipment, for example, has trouble making peacebetween its VAX and MIPS-based product lines.andM;The price of having two competing product lines is steep.andP;  Digital has cometo understand this well.andP;  The difference in price/performance between itsRISC and VAX product lines is enormous and has impacted VAX sales.andP;  To makematters worse, Digital's sales force still does not understand how to sellUltrix, its Unix product line, and feels more comfortable pushing what itknows--the VAX.andP;  Traditionally, the VAX and the VMS have been the platformsfor innovation in areas such as office, compound document architecture anddecision support.andP;  Digital's new transaction processing software will beintroduced on VMS, not Ultrix.andM;IBM will face the same challenge as it is forced to position the AS/400against the RISC servers.andP;  In the short run, IBM will legitimately claim thatthere is an incredible amount of software on the AS/400 for the turnkey,small business market.andP;  Much of this software has migrated from earlier IBMsystems, including the Systems/34, /36, and /38.andP;  In the long run, however,this may no longer be true.andP;  We expect that traditional Unix turnkey softwarevendors will provide solutions that will operate on the RS/6000.andP;  Thesevendors are motivated by price and are likely to find the RS/6000 to be anattractive server.andM;On the workstation side, IBM will find the RS/6000 competing against the highend of the Intel-based PS/2 line.andP;  This, too, will generate problems: Thepower and pricing of these two lines will intersect.andP;  The PS/2 systemconfigured with he i860 processor Wizard board as a graphics coprocessorcreates an impressive high-performance offering.andP;  However, IBM is beingcareful to position this PS/2 configuration at the OS/2 applications market.andM;How well will the RS/6000 withstand the internal pressures to keep other IBMproprietary platforms vibrant?andP;  When different IBM platforms were positionedfor different markets, there was internal jockeying.andP;  However, top managementwithin IBM has made it clear that the RS/6000 must be free from internalpolitics.andP;  In fact, we understand that the project team had a direct line ofcommunications into IBM CEO, John Akers.andP;  Akers asked to be informed if theseupstarts found their path being obstructed from within.andP;  Obviously, the topechelons within IBM wanted to make sure that the new RISC family would notfail because of any internal forces.andP;  This does not mean that there will beno internal conflicts among the groups.andP;  This will be one of the mostcritical areas for IBM to manage.andP;  Internal fighting for market share willhurt the AS/400 and PS/2 as well as the RS/6000 platforms.andM;TECHNICAL VERSUS COMMERCIAL.andP;  To reduce market conflicts with the AS/400, IBMis positioning the RS/6000 at the technical, numeric-intensive marketplace.andO;While this makes sense given the power, speed, and graphics of the newRS/6000 platforms, it is also clearly a defensive move.andP;  First, it givesAS/400 marketers some breathing room; second, it allows IBM time to build upthe perception that the platform is &quot;best of breed.&quot;andM;In fairness, IBM is leaving a window open for the commercial market in thefuture because management is smart enough to realize that commercial Unix isbecoming a reality.andP;  From our perspective, IBM's strongest appeal will be inthe commercial arena.andP;  While IBM will have to fight hard to win a covetedplace in the numeric-intensive workstation market, it is in the best positionto understand the needs and requirements of commercial data processingorganizations.andP;  As Unix slowly moves into corporations because of the freedomit offers, IBM will be well positioned.andP;  The company still has an excellentreputation and relationship with traditional MIS organizations.andP;  If thesemanagers are forced or decide on their own to pursue Unix, they are morelikely to trust IBM than an unknown Unix hot-box maker.andM;The Hardware ArchitectureandM;IBM's objective in developing the RS/6000 was to achieve its goal ofleadership in terms of price/performance in the workstation and server arena.andO;As part of this goal, IBM intends to provide competitive products in terms ofhigh-performance processing and graphics.andP;  High on this list iscommunication, not computing leadership.andP;  High on this list is communication,not only between members of its own family, but also with other Unixplatforms and between AIX and SAA.andP;  IBM's most ambitious goal is to properlthe RS/6000 into becoming the development platform of choice.andP;  IBM will haveto lure the best-of-breed developers.andP;  Its first chore will be to encouragethem to add an AIX port.andP;  Its second challenge will be to foster enoughconfidence so they'll write to the RS/6000 first.andM;Considering the magnitude of its goals and the place where it is starting(with only about 2 percent of the workstation market), IBM will not achieveits plan overnight.andP;  It will be a journey that will take years to achieve.andO;How does the score card look?andP;  IBM gets its best grades for developingexcellent price/performance and design.andP;  IBM seems to understand thelong-term commitment required and therefore plans to &quot;double theprice/performance every 12 to 24 months.&quot;andM;BUS ARCHITECTURE AND I/O.andP;  One problem that can sink the most powerfulprocessor is inadequate bus bandwidth.andP;  The RISC architecture combines widebuses with high memory bandwidth.andP;  IBM has two separate high performancebuses.andP;  One is the memory bus (either 64 or 128 bits, depending on the model)that transfers data between memory, cache, and the processor.andP;  The second busis a new generation of the MicroChannel architecture.andP;  This I/O bus allows 40Mbits per second burst mode transfers.andP;  This is double the data transfer rateon the first-generation PS/2 MicroChannel.andP;  Future versions of thistechnology will produce transfer rates of up to 80 MB and, at some point, to160 MB per second.andP;  When such a powerful version of the MicroChannel will beavailable is anyone's guess.andM;This 40MB per second transfer rate is attainable when long blocks of data aretransferred.andP;  The burst (or streaming data mode, as IBM calls it) isimportant for large quantities of data.andP;  It allows multiple data cycles to betransferred all at once within one bus envelope.andP;  Therefore, rather thanrequiring the user to send an address with every data transfer, the streamingdata works so that only the starting address has to be sent; then multipleconsecutive data packets can be transferred without multiple addresses beingsent.andP;  This doubles the performance for large groups of data beingtransferred together and also serves to improve error recovery because of theprecise I/O load and store interrupts.andM;Graphics.andP;  For the RS/6000 to become a primary developer's platform ofchoice, high-performance graphics are a given.andP;  In fact, the lack of advancedgraphics was one of the key problems with the RT.andP;  IBM has done a good jobdeveloping a high-performance graphics environment.andP;  IBM's goal is to makethe RS/6000 into an integrated multimedia system.andP;  Over time, the samecapabilities will be available on all platforms--across SAA and AIX.andP;  Eventhe entry-level, monochromatic workstation includes 16 gray shades.andP;  Thecolor displays provide 256 of 16 million colors.andP;  IBM will support 2-D aswell as 3-D graphics.andP;  Its high-end workstation, the 730, provides microcodedgraPHIGS (PHIGS is the IEEE-sanctioned distributed protocol for X-Window) andover 100 MFLOPS of dedicated throughput.andP;  And it also has the performance ofa million vectors per second.andP;  To improve performance, IBM has added hardwareassists for graphics.andP;  This workstation is specifically geared tographic-intensive 3-D applications such as molecular modeling and willcompete with the Apollo/HP DN 10000 and high-end machines from Sequent andStardent.andP;  In addition, IBM is providing the Silicon Graphics' GL library.andM;Memory.andP;  In the RS/6000, IBM has gone for a larger amount of real memory thanthat on the RT.andP;  The RS/6000 can support from 8 to 512MB (with 4Mbit chips).andO;In addition, IBM has improved virtual memory management so that programs ordatabases can span multiple physical disks.andP;  (See Illustration 1.)andM;System BalanceandM;Since the success of the original PC, vendors have traditionally integratedtechnology from different sources into a single system.andP;  But, as theworkstation market grows more competitive, this is no longer enough.andO;Leadership in this market requires attention to detail and attention toperformance.andP;  IBM wants so badly to succeed in the hot workstation arena thatit had to do better.andP;  Again, IBM is not alone here.andP;  MIPS has been aggressivein eking out the most performance possible from its 6000 line.andP;  However,because the 6000 is based on ECL technology, it is a high-end processor witha price tag of more than $100,000.andM;THE POWER DESIGN.andP;  The foundation of IBM's Power family is both RISC and CMOStechnology.andP;  RISC will ensure speed, and CMOS allows for low powerconsumption.andP;  Unlike the many RISC implementations that are based on thesingle CPU chip design, IBM has chosen to use multiple chips with moretransistors than are usually implemented in a single CPU.andP;  This allowed thecompany to construct a balanced system at the chip level.andP;  As CMOS technologygets denser, we expect the Power architecture to move to a single-chipimplementation.andM;IBM achieves its performance in several specific ways.andP;  It has hard-wiredinstructions rather than implementing them in microcode.andP;  To be able toachieve multiple instructions per cycle, IBM uses a pipelined implementationof RISC that allows for several different kinds of instructions to beprocessed simultaneously.andP;  IBM calls its POWER architecture for the RS/6000 aReduced Instruction Set Cycle architecture, based on concurrent execution offixed, floating point, and branch operations.andP;  Therefore, a user couldprocess--in parallel--four instructions and five operations in one cycle.andO;IBM has also embedded as much technology in the hardware as possible in areassuch as database assist and compiler-optimized performance.andM;Yes, there are definitely some advantages to owning the hardware environmentand not worrying about selling silicon to other vendors.andP;  Here, IBM has aunique advantage.andP;  There are very few companies that can develop a platformintended for the open systems arena and develop and market their ownprocessor without fear of offending users.andP;  Users will not be afraid to beboxed into an IBM-only hardware platform.andP;  The same cannot be said of smallerplayers in this market.andP;  In the future, IBM may decide to license some or allof its hardware technology.andM;Functional Units.andP;  The Power architecture is based on three independentfunctional units, each comprising its own chip: a branch processor, afixed-point processor, and a floating-point processor.andP;  Also include in thearchitecture are instruction and data cache units (DCU) as well as mainmemory and I/O registers and devices.andP;  The key to the Power design is thefact that the units were designed for maximum concurrence.andP;  The 184 RS/6000instructions are divded among the functional units to minimize interactionand synchronization.andM;Floating Point.andP;  Floating-point performance is an integral part of IBM'sstrategy.andP;  In order to capture the attention of numeric-intensive applicationdevelopers, floating-point performance has to be good.andP;  IBM has tightlycoupled the floating-point coprocessor to the rest of the CPU.andP;  Therefore,the floating-point unit and the fixed-point unit have equal priorities andindependent functional units.andP;  The floating-point unit has adouble-precision, wide data path, and it executes floating-point arithmeticoperations.andM;Multiprocessing Support.andP;  IBM supports concurrent parallel execution within asingle processor.andP;  But there is no multiprocessor support at introduction.andO;However, because IBM using optical cabling, coupled processors should providegood throughput and speed.andP;  In the future, IBM has stated, it will bebuilding N-way multiprocessing systems.andP;  IBM's use of optical cabling willhelp increase speed even on clustered processors as well as futuremultiprocessor designs.andM;The Software EnvironmentandM;IBM has done a credible job developing a superb hardware platform for the'90s.andP;  But the real test will be how well it will be able to apply itssophistication in hardware to software.andP;  The name of the game is volume ofapplications--at least initially.andP;  Competitors in the market will have afield day over the next few months because there will be so few softwarepackages available at announcement.andM;By first customership, some 200 products will be completed or nearcompletion.andP;  Several hundred other vendors will be at some stage ofnegotiation or completion of development.andP;  IBM has targeted about 1,500&quot;leading&quot; applications by the end of the year, but it will have to have manythousands of appliations in the pipeline.andP;  Luckily for IBM, it won't have todo all of the work.andP;  The company's job will be to lure developers to porttheir software to the RS/6000.andM;This is also IBM's most vulnerable area.andP;  Vendors like Sun, which has 3,000applications, and Digital, which is quickly building a base of applications,will be quick to point out that IBM doesn't have the same applications ortools.andP;  IBM, aware of its weaknesses here, is being extremely aggressive inluring developers.andP;  Those we've talked to have been pleased with theperformance and the support IBM has provided.andP;  IBM has 22 porting centers andintends to build more.andP;  For those developers IBM considers the most critical,the company has paid for ports and provided technical coding support.andP;  It hasinvited software developers to bring their applications to the Austin Labswhere the development team is based.andP;  Already, some 300 loaner systems are inthe hands of developers.andP;  Also, IBM is providing technical hot-line telephonesupport and electronic support.andP;  Discounts for developers will be up to 50percent.andP;  Therefore, a developer could buy an entry-level system for aslittle as $6,500.andP;  At the same time, IBM is training its own technical andmarketing staff.andP;  During 1989, IBM's AIX training accounted for 40,000student days; during 1990, it will provide 50,000 student days.andP;  In addition,IBM sent members of its technical staff for three-week internships withsoftware developers.andM;IBM expects 1,500 RT applications and 2,000 PS/2-based AIX applications to beported to the RS/6000.andP;  If IBM accomplishes this goal, it would definitelyhelp in the applications race.andM;Target MarketsandM;Initially, IBM has staked out the most power-hungry applications to show offthe power and throughput of the RS/6000.andP;  These include CAD/CAM/CAE, CASE,research, technical publishing, securities and trading systems, financial andeconomic analysis, statistical analysis, mapping, 3-D visualization, andanimation.andP;  To begin the cautious move into the commercial market, IBM hasalso targeted the personal productivity requirement of technicalprofessionals.andP;  This gives the company a foot in the door to the generalcommercial market.andP;  IBM is also including &quot;multiuser&quot; as a target market.andM;BASE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT TOOLS.andP;  To encourage CASE developers to jump onboard, IBM has included a toolkit for CASE programmers.andP;  Many of these areexisting tools for X-Window development.andP;  Others are conventional Unixcommands and libraries that IBM has packaged for developers.andP;  IBM has alsolined up some key CASE tools developers, such as Cadre (Teamwork product foranalysis and design); Oasys (C, Glockenspiel C++ preprocessor,cross-compilers); Sabre (Sabre-C for development and testing); Verdix (Adadevelopment system called VADS); Rational (Ada language developmentenvironment); and Atherton Technology (Software Backplane).andM;NATIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT.andP;  To support multiple language characters, IBM issupporting full eight-bit multibyte, multilingual message facilities.andP;  IBM issupporting 14 national languages including Japanese (with full Kanji),French, German and Italian.andM;PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT.andP;  The availability of languages and tools will be keyto IBM success in the technical Unix workstation market.andP;  To start, IBM willbe offering C, Fortran, Pascal, Cobol, C++, Lisp, Basic, and Ada, and it willneed the support of many of the ISVs specializing in tools.andP;  It will beespecially important for IBM to gain access to tools and compilers that runin a distributed environment.andM;USER INTERFACE AND USABILITY.andP;  AIXwindows, IBM's implementation of Motif, isthe key user interface for Rios.andP;  In fact, Motif was a gift to IBM, sinceIBM's Presentation Manager look was adopted for consistency with what OSF(Open Software Foundation) expected would be the commercial norm.andP;  Therefore,IBM has a good story to tell about having a common look and feel for userinterface on AIX and SAA.andM;IBM has added its own enhancements to Motif.andP;  For example, it has addedDisplay PostScript as an extension to X-Window.andP;  It has also tightlyintegrated the X Server into the hardware, which is transparent to the Xapplication.andP;  It writes to the hardware to gain speed for window-clipping andcolor tables.andM;As a desktop manager, IBM has adopted IXI's X.desktop.andP;  X.desktop providesPM-like icons that hide Unix commands by graphically representing files andprograms.andP;  From within X.desktop, uses can run programs and carry out filemanagement tasks such as copying, deleting, creating new fields anddirectories, printing, and archiving.andP;  Administrators can configure menus andrules from within X.desktop.andM;IBM is also providing traditional Unix interface shells such as the Korn (thedefault shell for AIX), Bourne, and C shells.andP;  In order to be able to runNextStep in the Unix environment, IBM is offering virtual terminal support sothat users can hot-key between environments.andP;  To satisfy the requirements ofuniversity researchers and other BSD aficionados, IBM is providing supportfor BSD job control.andM;One of the more interesting IBM-developed software is a new hypertext Help, adocumentation and navigation tool called InfoExplorer that comes as part ofthe operating system.andP;  The Help system allows users to navigate to specificHelp screens by selecting high-lighted words within a Help screen.andP;  The Helpsystem is intended to be used in conjunction with CD ROM technology, but itcan also be used with conventional storage media.andP;  In the future, IBM willmake InfoExplorer available to software developers so that users can use thesame help for the system and the application.andM;In addition to Motif, IBM has made NeXT's NextStep available as analternative user interface and development environment.andP;  While NextStepprovides IBM with the opportunity to give its third-party developers a set ofadvanced tools, it also causes some problems.andP;  First, users may be confusedby having a choice of two user interfaces.andP;  This problem is fairly easy tosolve if IBM positions NextStep as a development environment.andP;  However, amore difficult problem is the fact that NextStep does not run under X-Window.andO;Therefore, developers working with the NextStep tools cannot port theirapplications outside of that closed environment.andP;  The stumbling block isSteven Jobs's reluctance to port NextStep to X-Window.andP;  Some developers atMIT have found a way to display an X-Window inside NextStep, but they havenot figured out how to have the NextStep tools run directly under X.andP;  But,because IBM is trying to position itself on the leading edge oftechnology--both hardware and software--it makes sense for the company to beable to offer a set of tools like NextStep.andP;  IBM's managers would like tooffer lots of tools like NextStep for developers.andP;  It is part of the overallstrategy to provide developers with best-of-breed tools and technology.andM;AIX AND DOS.andP;  IBM has enhanced its PC Simulator software.andP;  The emulation ishandled in the software rather than in hardware.andP;  It also supports extendedmemory.andP;  PC Simulator will now enable binary shrinkwrapped 20 MHz, 386 DOSapplications to run unaltered.andP;  This makes AIX a more attractive environmentfor users who want to maintain their DOS environment.andM;CommunicationsandM;IBM has two goals for its communications environment.andP;  The first is toprovide a robust distributed computing environment for AIX (see Illustration3).andP;  In the long term, IBM would like to be able to proclaim DE Corum the RFTsubmission to the Open Software Foundation from itself, HP/Apollo, Locus,Digital, and Microsoft.andP;  However, IBM is intent on proving that it isconforming to industry standards (see Illustration 4).andP;  Therefore, it wantsto wait and make sure DE Corum is accepted by OSF.andP;  IBM would be in anawkward situation if it gave all-out support to DE Corum and then had tobacktrack if OSF adopted another solution or even parts of other solutions.andM;We expect that, once OSF makes its decision this spring, IBM willaggressively begin to implement DE Corum for the RS/6000.andP;  In addition, IBMhas indicated that it will also port this distributed computing technology toits proprietary SAA environment.andP;  The implications are intriguing.andM;The part of DE Corum that IBM has not hesitated about supporting is Apollo'sNetwork Computing System (NCS).andP;  Interestingly, NCS will also be adopted aspart of OS/2.andP;  The NCS Remote Procedure Call mechanism is nowwell-acknowledged and is accepted as sophisticated technology.andP;  In addition,IBM plans to adopt the HP/Apollo Location Broker, a directory system for NCS.andO;In deference to industry de facto standards, IBM has adopted Sun's NetworkFile System (NFS) Version 4.0 with locking and Yellow Pages, and has killedoff its own Distributed Services (DS).andM;It is no surprise that TCP/IP is a key part of IBM's strategy for handlingcommunications between systems.andP;  TCP/IP also supports interoperabilitybetween AIX and SAA.andP;  TCP/IP has been ported to OS/2, the AS/400, and will beavailable on MVS and VM.andM;Other protocols supported include:andM;* Basic Networking Utilities (BNC/UUCP), available for either asynchronouscommunication or for any networks supported by TCP/IP via the IP protocolandM;* X.25 application support, including messaging and file transfer, and a linkcontrol and line monitoring programandM;* Ethernet and Token-Ring supportandM;MAIL.andP;  IBM is supporting two mail facilities: the Tahoe 4.3 BSD mail-basedapplication or the Mail Handling (MH) application.andP;  MH, originally developedby the Rand Corporation, includes message annotation, mail folder-handling,message-sequencing, message-packaging, and date-sorting.andP;  In the future, IBMplans to provide an X.400 mail gateway between OfficeVision and Unix mail.andO;SNA connectivity is part of AIX, including support for LU0, 1, 2, 3 andLU6.2.andP;  Long term, IBM will provide native OSI protocols across both AIX andSAA.andP;  (See Illustration 5.)andM;Network Management has traditionally been a weakness in IBM Unix strategysince it relies on a 370 to manage systems via NetView.andP;  IBM will provideNetView alerts from RS/6000 systems networks into a NetView mainframeenvironment.andP;  However, for a user who chose not to implement a member of the370 family, this network management software would not be available.andP;  Toremedy this situation, IBM is offering network management through the TCP/IPSimple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).andP;  Long term, IBM intends to provideCMIS (Common Management Information Services) and its assocaited protocolCMIP (Common Management Information Protocol).andM;One missing piece from the interoperability story is the lack of a definedApplications Programming Interface (API) between AIX and SAA.andP;  While IBM hasestablished CPI-C (Communications Programming Interface-C) as the API forSAA, it is not yet available under Unix.andP;  In the long term, this could besolved because IBM provided CPI-C to X/Open.andP;  If CPI-C can evolve outside ofthe SAA environment, it will h elp IBM tremendously.andP;  In the meantime, IBMdoes not have a good story to tell in terms of interoperability at theapplicaitons level.andP;  However, even if CPI-C becomes a generalized interfaceadopted by X/Open, additional work is required before developers will be ableto make good use of the technology.andP;  CPI-C is a low-level protocol that isextremely difficult for developers to write to.andP;  IBM needs to develop higherlevel APIs.andM;Database.andP;  IBM, in its initial release of the RS/6000, will be relying on thedominant Unix database management systems.andP;  Therefore, it will have ports ofthe major offering, including Ingres (the first to be available), Informix,Oracle, Sybase, Unify, Data Access, and Progress.andP;  Long term, however, IBMhas greater ambitions in the database arena.andP;  First, it plans to have its ownSQL Distributed Daabase for AIX that will be based on DB2 and will be muchlike the database manager on OS/2.andP;  IBM also has plans to provide anobject-oriented data repository for AIX (similar to the SAA repository),which will be aimed at the CASE market.andM;Office.andP;  The same issue facing IBM in the Unix database arena faces IBM inthe office.andP;  Initially, the best IBM will be able to do is to provide pors ofthe usual suspects (Quadratron, Uniplex, R Sysems, and Applix).andP;  In addition,IBM has picked up two lesser known vendors--BBN's Slate product (see Vol.andP;  3,No.andP;  8), which includes a compound document editor, mail system, andcalendar; and Decathlon's Medallion, an integrated office package that hasbeen bid to the government.andP;  IBM's first announced spreadsheet will beInformix's innovative Wingz product.andP;  We wouldn't be surprised to see Lotus1-2-3 in the near future.andM;IBM has stated publicly that it will port OfficeVision for AIX.andP;  However, notime frame is indicated for such a port.andP;  We question whether IBM could orshould move this code base.andP;  OfficeVision has not been widely accepted incorporations so far, and it is less rich than some of hte stable of existingUnix office products.andP;  IBM might be beter off providing a more open officeenvironment by providing enablers and communications underpinning andallowing users to add in their productivity applicaitons of choice.andM;The Operating System (AIX 3.1)andM;AIX has been big news since OSF decided to adopt it as the foundation for itsoperating system.andP;  It was even bigger news when OSF decided to replace theAIX kernel with the Mach kernel from Carnegie Mellon.andP;  However, as IBM iseager to point out, OSF still will use its commands and libraries as part ofOSF/1.andP;  Although IBM has licensed OSF/1, it is still studying theramifications of replacing its own kernel with the OSF operating system.andP;  Ithas not yet made the decision.andM;IBM has done a major rewrite of its operating system, a task made difficultby the scope and ambition of the plan.andP;  While IBM wanted to add a lot ofvalue, it also had to remain within the acceptable standards.andP;  AIX is anindustry-standard operating system, inasmuch as any Unix vendor's operatingsystem is.andP;  It is fully compliant with Posix 1003.1, and all compilers forthe operating system are ANSI compliant.andP;  However, to compete, each vendor inthe market tends to make changes (some more extensive than others) to providevalue-added.andM;IBM has not, however, moved to ATandamp;T System V.3.andP;  IBM is missing Streams, theTransport Library Interface (TLI), and the file system switch (fss).andP;  IBMdoes support the NFS Vnode switch.andP;  Because it does not support fss, IBM willhave to develop its own optical disk file system.andP;  IBM's version of Unixcomplies with ATandamp;T's System V.2 (based on a System V.3 license) and BSD 4.3.andO;(Version 3.2 will fully comply with XPG 3 guidelines.)andP;  The previous versionof AIX provided many System V.2 functions but was deviant in many areas.andO;This is an improvement.andP;  IBM is leaving out Streams and TLI from System V.3.andO;IBM even now talks about its relationship with Unix International in additionto its well-documented relationship with OSF.andP;  This is definitely a change inattitude.andM;To keep the research and university community happy, IBM added to AIX 3.1 allof the Berkeley operating system (BSD 4.3).andP;  Commands that conflict or arecontradictory to a System V command are taken out and included in a separatelibrary.andP;  These folks want nothing to do with System V.andP;  As far as they areconcerned, only BSD counts.andM;IBM has gone to great lengths to completely merge (including the interfaces)these two operating systems, which has not been easy.andP;  ATandamp;T did not go thisfar when it developed System V.4.andP;  The coupling of System V and BSD is lesswell integrated in System V.4.andP;  However, if System V.4 should become anindustry standard, IBM will have to make more changes to AIX Version 3 to becompliant.andM;IBM has also gotten rid of one of its biggest impediments--the VirtualResource Manager (VRM), which was closely tied to the 370 architecture.andP;  TheVRM had enabled IBM to quickly get up and running with a version of Unix, butdetracted from its ability to move to other architectures.andP;  VRM has beenmerged into the kernel.andP;  Much of this work was initiated so that AIX couldbecome a portable operating system for OSF.andP;  (See Illustration 6.)andM;* IBM's extensions to the standards are impressive.andP;  Some of the mostinteresting changes include:andM;* Extension of the kernel so that users can install code when the system isrunning.andP;  Therefore, for example, a user who has installed an SNA subsystemand seen a mistake can reinstall the system without taking it down.andM;* Full support for shared libraries.andM;* A paged kernel that runs in 52-bit virtual memory.andM;* Support for real-time and priority scheduling and dynamic linking as wellas support for preemption, which is useful in tightly coupledmultiprocessing.andM;* Journaled file system, an extension to the Unix file system.andP;  It doesdatabase journaling and allows all files to be swapped in and out of virtualmemory with one I/O mechanism.andP;  The biggest benefit of this is that a userdoes not have to rebuild a file system if there is a crash or if not enoughspace has been allocated for files.andM;* A buffered cache mechanism, allowing the file system to keep track of thestatus of files.andP;  If something happens, a user can rerun the log and notallow any partial records to be brought forward.andP;  This is important foronline transaction processing applications.andM;System Management.andP;  The System Management Interface Tool (SMIT) includes1,000 menus for system administration to help guide administrators throughsuch thorny processes as system configuration and administration (seeIllustration 7).andP;  It will prompt the administrator in installing differentsystems such as NFS, device drivers, and logical and mini disks.andP;  Havingeasily installable device drivers will be a major benefit to users who havestruggled with the intricacies of installing drivers on traditional Unixsystems.andP;  Also included with SMIT are some base application and graphicsdevelopment tools.andM;Diagnostics.andP;  The diagnostics run on top of Version 3 and are used forelectronic customer support.andP;  They include tracing and error-logging, andwill indicate how much file system space is available and allocated.andM;The Logical Volume Manager (LVM).andP;  The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) willallow applications and files to span physical disks.andP;  It also includes theability to automatically maintain several copies of files at the logicalvolume level.andP;  Thus, AIX provides disk-mirroring capability, which isimportant for transaction processing applications.andP;  The LVM will beimplemented as part of OSF/1.andM;Security.andP;  Initially, AIX Version 3 will support C2 security.andP;  However, B1 isIBM's goal for this year.andP;  This is a key requirement for government andinternational bids.andM;MIGRATION FROM THE RT.andP;  With the RS/6000, the RT has been replaced.andP;  Toencourage RT customers to migrate, IBM is offering them an 80 percenttrade-in option (for all systems installed until the end of 1990).andP;  Theoperating system is designed so that applications are source-code compatiblewith the RT.andP;  In many cases, code will have to be recompiled only to migrate.andO;The exception is where developers have written code to the hardware interfacelevel, such as graphics, to develop applications.andM;Service and SupportandM;IBM will try to leverage its solid reputation in service and support as a wayto gain market share in the Unix arena.andP;  For example, IBM is bundling aone-year, on-site service warranty with its workstation and server.andP;  It willalso offer remote electronic problem-determination.andP;  If IBM has done a goodjob training its support team, this could be a valuable asset, especiallywhen the company starts trying to sell into the commercial market.andP;  In thissame vein, IBM has initiated a program called SystemXtra to provide &quot;a totalservice solution after system installation.&quot;andP;  It will support both IBM's ownsystems and third-party hardware and software.andP;  This is the first time IBM isundertaking such a multivendor support program.andP;  Included is an 800 numberfor both hardware and software support.andM;The Bottom LineandM;IBM has paid its dues and has done a credible job of completely revamping itsUnix platform.andP;  It is now clearly in the running and can play in the bigleagues.andP;  The company will be under incredible pressure to get as manyenablers and products out on the platform before the end of the year.andO;Because of the frantic and competitive pace of this market, IBM will not haveany grace period for enjoying its initial success.andP;  Its competitors arebreathing down its neck and are poised to respond.andP;  HP is incrediblyaggressive in terms of price/performance on the combined Apollo/HP RISCplatforms coming by the end of '90.andP;  MIPS is also hot, and it can claim thesame level of price/performance.andP;  Sun Microsystems and its partners clearlywill not stand still.andP;  Digital Equipment has lots of equipment in thepipelines.andP;  And there will certainly be other start-ups that will be able tomove fast to leapfrog them all.andM;The one benefit IBM has over these guys is the fact that it is IBM.andP;  It willgain respectability that will go a long way in encouraging third parties tomove to its platform.andP;  The fact that IBM fell flat on its face with the RThas motivated its developers to go all-out for the Rios platform.andP;  They havelearned a lot of lessons about what it takes to fail: that they need todifferentiate between workstations and servers, that applications andgraphics and high levels of performance are critical, and just how importantit is for a company to pledge allegiance to standards.andP;  IBM's developers aregoing to make sure this time that they succeed.andM;The coming year will be a critical period for IBM.andP;  It will have to continueto work with developers and end users, begin to position the RS/6000 in thecommercial as well as the numeric-intensive market, exploit the distributedcomputing technology it has begun to make use of, and continue to ramp up theproduction of more powerful boxes.andP;  The RS/6000 is a good first step on atough road.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
