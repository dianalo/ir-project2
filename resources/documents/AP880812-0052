Dr. Stephen C. Joseph said in an interview published in today'sNew York Times that the experiment is expected to begin in about 10weeks.   Needles are already distributed in several other countries. Butdespite nationwide debate, no government agency has yet done so inthe United States.   If New York's start-up program is successful, officials hope tobroaden the distribution among the city's estimated 200,000intravenous drug-abusers. Sample blood tests indicate about halfthat group are already infected with the AIDS virus.   The experiment was approved this week by the state HealthDepartment and local prosecutors have judged it to be legal, theTimes said.   Critics of the needles plan, including some prosecutors andblack officials, contend it will promote illicit drug abuse.   ``The end is commendable, of course,'' said Manhattan BoroughPresident David N. Dinkins, a black who is against the plan. ``ButI maintain that drug use is unacceptable, and I do not accept thenotion that we can make drugs safer.''   In New York City, needle use has become the leading method ofinfection for new AIDS cases.   The 200 people to receive needles will be chosen from waitinglists of addicts seeking drug treatment. Another 200 will be chosenas a control group; they will not receive needles but their drugbehavior and AIDS infection will be monitored.   Anyone who receives free needles will be required to turn inused ones each time they get another, to prevent improperdistribution of the needles.</TEXT></DOC>
