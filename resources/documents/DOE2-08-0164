The percentage error of the Angstroms turbidityparameter due to the aureole flux density involved in the sunphotometrybecomes more serious for clear conditions than for turbid conditions.The colorimetric property of the solar aureole varies noticeability placeby place for the atmosphere containing larger particles, although themost reddish point does not change its position of about 1.6{sup 0} fromthe sun for different turbidity conditions. Comparing with non-absorbingaerosols, absorbing aerosols make the aureole region in the colorimetricdistribution more bluish for clear conditions, and more reddish for turbidconditions.
