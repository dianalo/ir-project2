He adds, however, that such &quot;serious scrutiny and criticism&quot; of Israeli actions can be found only in the Israeli press, never in the American press.    If by describing me as a &quot;devoted yes man,&quot; Mr. Cockburn means to suggest that, as a Jew, my love for Israel is constant and, as an American, my commitment to its security is unqualified, he described me accurately. It is in this sense that I would consider Mr. Cockburn a &quot;devoted no man,&quot; that is, someone whose ill-will toward Israel is constant and whose efforts to undermine the close relations between Israel and the U.S. are unrelenting.    If, however, Mr. Cockburn meant to suggest that I am unwilling to challenge and criticize specific Israeli policies that I believe to be misguided or unjust, he is simply wrong. He is equally wrong in stating that such criticism is voiced only in the Israeli press.    My criticism of Israel's dealings with Iran, to which his article refers, appeared not only in Israel's Ha'aretz, as he notes, but in Moment magazine, an American publication. My criticism of Israel's handling of the Pollard affair, to which he does not refer, appeared in the Los Angeles Times.    Over the years, I have taken issue with former Prime Minister Golda Meir's notion that the Palestinians are not a people, with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's conception of the role of American Jews vis-a-vis Israel, and, more recently, with Israel's handling of the so-called Shin Bet affair, in which there occurred a cover-up of the killing of two Arab terrorists by intelligence agents after they had been taken into custody. Israel's trade with South Africa, its administration of the West Bank and the treatment of Jewish terrorists as compared with Arab terrorists have also been the subject of &quot;serious critical scrutiny.&quot; And virtually every one of these issues was taken up in the American press.    In short, there is virtually no aspect of Israel's public life that has escaped the frank critical attention of &quot;devoted yes men.&quot; The difference between Mr. Cockburn and critics such as myself is that we know what Mr. Cockburn deliberately chooses to ignore -- that even after one takes full critical account of Israel's many shortcomings, it remains a singularly freedom-loving and humane society. Israel's public, its press and its judiciary have asserted themselves time and time again to vindicate Israel's reputation as one of the world's most vigorous and irrepressible democracies.    To be sure, the Pollard affair (particularly the promotion of his Israeli &quot;handlers&quot;), the Iranian fiasco and the South African connection, among other problems, are indications of a distressing arrogance and insensitivity on the part of various Israeli officials. But such arrogance is hardly endemic to the Israeli government, as our own Irangate scandal should have made abundantly clear. And contrary to Mr. Cockburn's &quot;j'accuse,&quot; it is precisely those people whom he dismisses as yes men who often were the first to publicly criticize these policies.    I do not deny Mr. Cockburn's assertion that there are many Jewish organizational leaders, still fearful of Israel's ability to repel the onslaught of its enemies if it no longer enjoyed U.S. protection (a protection Mr. Cockburn has been doing his level best to undermine), who do not condone public criticism of Israel. However, there are other Jewish leaders who believe they are wrong, and who have expressed their disagreement publicly, as I have. They do so not only in the belief that frank and critical exchanges between American Jewry and Israel can only, in the long run, strengthen the ties that bind our two democracies, but also because they know that in the absence of such candor, it is critics with unrestrained ill-will toward Israel who &quot;will get away with anything.&quot;    Henry Siegman   Executive Director   American Jewish Congress   New York</TEXT></DOC>
