MichCon, which has annual revenue of about $1.4 billion, represents about 90% of Primark's total assets. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Primark rose $1.75 a share on the news to close at $20.50. Based on that price, the MichCon spinoff would have an indicated market value of about $365 million.    The proposal, which was endorsed by Primark's board, requires shareholder approval. A meeting of holders is planned in May to vote on the plan.    Robert W. Stewart, Primark's 63-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, said he will retire if the spinoff is approved. He said he would be succeeded by Joseph E. Kasputys, who was named president and chief operating officer last summer. Before joining Primark, which is based in McLean, Va., Mr. Kasputys was executive vice president of New York-based McGraw-Hill Inc.    Separately, Primark said it will take a charge of $53.2 million in the 1987 fourth quarter for costs related to restructuring its aviation group. In the 1986 quarter, Primark reported net income of $15.6 million, or 79 cents a share.    In recent years, Mr. Stewart has pushed to transform Primark from a natural-gas utility into an ambitious conglomerate with interests in leasing, mortgage banking, aviation services and health-care telecommunications.    The proposed spinoff would leave Primark with a modest revenue stream and much smaller profits. In 1986 MichCon contributed all but about $100 million of $1.5 billion in revenue and about $49.9 million of the parent company's $53.8 million of earnings.    &quot;I always knew the company had to be separated sometime,&quot; Mr. Stewart said. &quot;We wanted to find a way to increase the value for shareholders and to draw a distinction between our utility and diversified units. I thought this was the right time.&quot;    Under the plan, about 95% of MichCon's 10.3 million common shares outstanding, all of which are held by Primark, would be distributed to Primark shareholders. The proposal also provides for stock options and other incentives designed to retain Mr. Kasputys and other executives.    Primark also said its board adopted a shareholder-rights plan as a temporary precaution. Rights issued under the plan would expire 30 days after completion of the proposed spinoff, unless extended.    The company said the plan is designed to deter &quot;coercive or unfair takeover tactics,&quot; although it isn't being proposed in response to any known takeover threat.    Analysts generally reacted favorably to the spinoff idea. Gary Hovis, a utilities-industry analyst at Argus Research in New York, said the move would let Primark concentrate &quot;on things that they're more interested in.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
