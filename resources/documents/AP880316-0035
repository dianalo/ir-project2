WAKIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Investigators are trying to learn whetherFerdinand Marcos was behind a plot to ship weapons from the UnitedStates to forces loyal to him in the Philippines, federal officialssay.   U.S. officials suspect the ousted Philippines president may havebeen instrumental in abortive plans to supply automatic rifles andsubmachine guns for an 80-member force.   Marcos' chief American attorney, however, denies Marcos wasinvolved in any arms shipments. ``That's a dry well for you, myfriend,'' Richard A. Hibey said Friday in Washington. ``There's notruth to that allegation.''   Details of the planned arms sale surfaced here last fall duringa federal trial of Leon Dicker, a disbarred Hewlett, N.Y., lawyerconvicted of conspiring to export weapons illegally.   At trial, the government said the arms were bound for Thailand.But two federal officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said last week that authorities believe the weapons were forpro-Marcos forces in the Philippines.   Dicker, two men acquitted in the case and one who pleaded guiltyand testified for the prosecution were arrested in a U.S. CustomsService ``sting.'' No arms were alleged to have changed hands.   The officials said New York businessman Robert L. Steele is afocus of the continuing investigation. During the trial, theprosecutor said Steele had worked with Dicker on the arms deal, butSteele was not charged.   Steele and Dicker have been linked to Orlando C. Dulay, a Marcossupporter and former provincial governor later linked by Philippinemilitary sources to an August 1987 coup attempt in the Philippines.   Dulay, detained by authorities in August 1986 on the grounds ofa Marcos-owned estate near Princeton University, said Steel andDicker were his ``lawyers'' who had sent him to clean up thecourt-sealed property at Marcos' request.   A newspaper in Manila reported last week that Dulay wascontacted by U.S. authorities who traveled there seeking hiscooperation in the investigation of alleged arms shipments topro-Marcos groups.   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Peyton in Honolulu on Mondayconfirmed that he met with Dulay last week, but said he could notcomment further because of an ``ongoing criminal investigation.''   Raul Rabe, deputy chief of mission at the Philippines Embassy inWashington, said Dulay recently ``surfaced in Honolulu and joinedMr. Marcos'' before being deported to the Philippines, where hefaces charges in the 1986 slayings of three campaign workers ofPresident Corazon Aquino.   Marcos has been living in exile in Honolulu since his 1986ouster and the election of Mrs. Aquino as president. He has said hewishes to return to his homeland. Marcos supporters failed in two1987 coup attempts.   Last year, two U.S. businessmen testifying before a Housesubcommittee played secretly recorded conversations with Marcos andsaid that Marcos had sought to buy weapons for shipment to thePhilippines.   The weapons discussed in the House testimony allegedly were tobe used for a coup attempt in late June, four months after Dicker'sarrest. It could not be determined if the alleged June coupattempt, the Dicker case and the Honolulu investigation wererelated.   A government source said U.S. authorities suspect a link betweenMarcos and the New Jersey arms case, but declined to providespecifics.   Abelardo Morua, Dicker's co-defendant who pleaded guilty, wasquestioned recently by federal authorities about a possible linkbetween Marcos and the weapons deal, said Morua's attorney, ChrisFranzblau. He said Morua provided no information.   Several government officials with knowledge of theinvestigation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that todiscuss the case openly could jeopardize a prosecution.   Neither U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. nor Richard Mercier,head of the Customs Service's Newark office, would comment on thecase.   ``Our policy is never to confirm or deny any inquiry,'' saidLeonard S. Walton, Customs' director of illegal exportinvestigations in Washington.   On Monday, Marcos issued a statement denying he was ``bent ontaking control (of the Philippines) through violent means.''   The news that authorities are pressing the investigation in thisnew direction surfaced last Wednesday when U.S. District JudgeAlfred J. Lechner Jr., in sentencing Morua here, referred to acontinuing probe.   Steele did not return repeated phone calls this week and last athis Manhattan conglomerate, Commonwealth Group Ltd., a privatecompany.   Dicker, sentenced to four years, said he could not comment onthe matter because he was appealing his conviction.</TEXT></DOC>
