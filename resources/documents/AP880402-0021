Shultz hasrecommended kidnapping Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriegaand a CIA-coordinated military coup as ways of unseating thegeneral, a newspaper reported today.   Shultz and Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state forLatin America, also suggested landing more than 3,000 U.S. soldiersin Panama to encourage Panamanian military officers opposed toNoriega, said the Los Angeles Times.   The proposals were strongly opposed by the CIA and DefenseSecretary Frank C. Carlucci, who labeled them dangerous andill-timed, said the Times, quoting unidentified administrationofficials on both sides of the discussion.   However, actions still being considered by the Cabinet includefomenting a coup against Noriega and landing more than 3,000soldiers at U.S. installations in Panama in a show of force, theTimes said. A group of Panamanian officers attempted a coup lastmonth, but failed.   State Department spokesman Charles Redman, traveling with Shultzin Rome, would not comment on the report.   Shultz and Abrams suggested sending a special operations team tokidnap Noriega and bring him to the United States for trial on drugtrafficking charges, the newspaper said.   A kidnapping was ruled out after opponents argued that theUnited States' image would be blackened if Noriega wereaccidentally killed during such an attempt, the Times said. Theyalso warned Shultz of the repercussions of arresting a foreignleader in his own country to face criminal charges in the UnitedStates.   Shultz and Abrams also proposed taking unspecified militaryaction inside Panama in response to a request from deposed civilianPresident Eric A. Delvalle, the newspaper said. Delvalle was oustedby Noriega last month after he attempted to fire the general.   The Pentagon announced Friday that it was sending about 1,300additional military personnel to Panama to improve security forU.S. bases and for U.S. civilians living there.   The move fell far short of the steps advocated by Shultz, whourged the use of force against Noriega after aides concluded U.S.economic pressure on the troubled Central American country wasfaltering, the Times said.   The United States already has about 10,000 troops in Panama toprotect the strategic Panama Canal. An additional 17,000 U.Scitizens live in Panama.   Pressure against Noriega's regime has been mounting since he wasnamed in a federal indictment alleging he helped drug traffickersmove cocaine into the United States.   U.S. officials have also alleged that Noriega was dealing withCuban President Fidel Castro while was ostensibly cooperating withU.S. drug and intelligence agencies.   The Reagan administration precipitated an economic crisis inPanama last month by cutting off the supply of U.S. dollars toPanamanian banks. But the maneuver appeared to weaken this weekafter Noriega broke a general strike, seized flour mills andreopened Panama's ports.</TEXT></DOC>
