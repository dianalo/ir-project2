(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ladies of the night who have kept the redlights burning at America's best-known brothel have a new employer- Uncle Sam, by way of federal Bankruptcy Court.   The Mustang Ranch, Nevada's oldest legal bordello, shut downTuesday after filing for bankruptcy liquidation. On Wednesday, acourt trustee took charge of the money-losing business until it canbe sold or creditors are paid off.   Prostitutes who had earlier fled out of fear that tax collectorswere about to raid the place filtered back Wednesday, some to pickup belongings and others to resume work at the 105-room brothel.   ``I want to come back, but I'm not going to work for nogovernment,'' said a woman who identified herself only as Beth.   ``A lot of girls don't like the idea of working for Uncle Sam,''said 22-year-old Bree. ``They don't like the idea of having to paytaxes. But I know I'm going to give it a try. If I don't like it,I'll go to the Chicken Ranch outside Las Vegas.''   A lawyer for owner Joe Conforte said Internal Revenue Serviceharassment killed a $5 million deal to sell the bordello and forcedit into liquidation. Officials said Conforte owes $13 million infederal taxes. Conforte put his debt at no more than $7 million.   The Mustang was an illegal operation when Conforte and his wife,Sally, opened it on a 440-acre ranch 10 miles east of Reno in the1950s. It became the state's first legal brothel in 1971.   The bordello had been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protectionsince 1982, meaning it operated under court supervision while ittried to pay off creditors. Two attempts to sell the businessthrough stock offerings failed.   Jeri Coppa, who previously managed smaller brothels in Nevada inher role as bankruptcy trustee, said she hopes to have the Mustangreopened for business by the weekend. She said officials fromBankruptcy Court will be on location at all times to make surethings run smoothly and that the government gets its due.   ``My whole thing is if you're running a business, you're runninga business,'' said Coppa.   Plans to reopen immediately were blocked by state health rules,which require any prostitute who leaves the premises to be retestedfor sexually transmitted diseases. That can take three days.   The prostitutes must undergo monthly checkups. Clients must wearcondoms.   Some 45 prostitutes, bartenders and floor supervisors signed upto resume work. Coppa said the IRS assured her it would not harassthe women for back taxes.   When the Mustang first opened, prostitution was tolerated butillegal in Nevada. It was burned down by local authorities in 1960as a public nuisance.   Conforte won Storey County approval for the brothel 11 yearslater, pioneering the movement to allow prostitution in 11 ofNevada's 18 counties.   Prostitutes rented rooms at the ranch, which also got half theirearnings. They accepted credit cards, in advance.   Conforte fled to Brazil in 1981 after being convicted of taxevasion but returned in 1983 in a deal with prosecutors to testifyagainst U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne. Conforte claimedClaiborne took $85,000 in bribes.   After a hung jury resulted in a mistrial, prosecutors droppedcharges related to Conforte. Ultimately Claiborne was convicted ofhiding more than $100,000 in income from the IRS. He was laterimpeached.</TEXT></DOC>
