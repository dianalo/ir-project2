(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hospital Corporation of America saidWednesday that it will take $100 million less than the expected$1.225 billion for its psychiatric company, the largest HCA unit forsale to help finance the company's management-led takeover.   HCA executives said in March, when shareholders voted to sell thecompany for $3.6 billion, that subsidiaries would be sold to repay a$1.3 billion bridge loan due in two years.   ``We are ahead of schedule of our repayment of the bridge loan,''HCA spokesman David McFadden said.   The company said in a news release that it has received seniorloan financing commitments and other financing details involved inselling HCA Psychiatric Company. Psychiatric company executives andan employee stock ownership plan support the sale.   While HCA will accept the lower purchase price, it will retainownership of $150 million in the psychiatric company's common stockand preferred stock along with warrants to buy additional shares ofcommon stock.   Officials said $650 million in financing will be provided by GECapital and The Bank of Nova Scotia. GE Capital also will buy $60million of the psychiatric company's senior discount notes.   Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. will arrange the placement of debt andpreferred stock of HPC for $530 million, accounting for the rest ofthe financing.   Financing still has to be approved by HCA's board with closingexpected to be completed by the end of the year.   The psychiatric company owns 52 facilities with about 5,500 beds.   HCA owns 78 medical-surgical hospitals with more than 18,000 bedsin the United States.   HCA Chairman Thomas Frist Jr. said in March that the companywould likely sell its psychiatric division, its management companyand its international division to held finance the leveraged buyout.   In a leveraged buyout, the assets of the company are used ascollateral to borrow money needed to purchase the company. Such atransaction usually increases the company's debt substantially.   Sale of HCA's Allied Clinical Laboratories already was beingconsidered when the merger was approved March 15.   At the time, Frist said he wanted to streamline HCA to get backto the basic business of owning and managing hospitals.</TEXT></DOC>
