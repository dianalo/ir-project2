He said Iran would be considered a provisional member of the124-member federation as soon as it pays its back dues.   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, the late Iranian leader, bannedchess following the 1979 revolution. Last fall, however, he saidthe game was acceptable so long as it did not involve gambling.   The general secretary of the Iranian Chess Federation, KhosraHirandi, told chess officials that women and men would not beallowed to play one another, according to Boris Kutin ofYugoslavia, a member of the international federation's 14-manexecutive council.   Campomanes said Iran would compete with the other countries ofthe Middle East.   ``There was a question of whether it was compatible for Iran tobe in that zone, when Iraq was in the same zone, and Mr. Harandisaid there was no problem from that direction,'' he said.   Campomanes said the last Iranian to compete in a federationcompetition was in 1979, although it continued to pay membershipdues until 1982.   Casto Abundo of the Philippines, the federation's generalsecretary, said he did not know how much the Iranian ChessFederation owed in unpaid dues.</TEXT></DOC>
