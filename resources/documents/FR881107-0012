Wilhelmsen.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ ICCO identified two distinct types of MFS clauses. Underthe first, if the contract carrier or conference offers to any other shipper(by service contract or by tariff) a lower rate for that commodity forthat service than is offered to the contract shipper under the servicecontract, the contract shipper will prospectively receive the lower rate.The second type is referred to by ICCO as a ``Crazy Eddie'' clause. Underthis arrangement, if, during the contract term, the contract carrier orany other carrier offers the contract shipper or any other shipper (byservice contract, by tariff, or by other means), a lower rate for thatcommodity for that service than is provided to the contract shipper underthe service contract, the contract shipper will prospectively receive thatlower rate from the contract carrier.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ ICCO would classify as ``<T3>de minimis,</T3>'' damages for cargo shortfall that are less than seventy-fivepercent of the contract rate.After consideration of the forty-one comments received, the Commissionpublished a Proposed Rule prohibiting MFS clauses in service contracts(53 FR 8775, March 17, 1988). The Proposed Rule defined a ``most-favored-shipperclause'' as:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * a service contract provision that allows a service contractrate or rate schedule(s), or any other essential term(s), to be changedto adopt (by direct match, formula or by any other means) any provisionoffered to the contracting shipper or another shipper, by tariff filing,other service contract, or any other offering, by any other carrier orconference.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">However, the Proposed Rule would have permitted adjustments in servicecontract rates based upon charges in a carrier's or conference's own tariffsor service contracts. Accordingly, proposed andSection; 581.5(a)(4) statedthat the essential terms of a service contract:<ITAG tagnum="21">May incorporate by reference additional charges, surcharges, allowances,or adjustment factors as set forth in the service contract carrier's orconference's tariff of general applicability or service contract essentialterms publication in the same trade in effect on the date of executionof the service contract. The reference must be made by specific FMC tariffor essential terms publication number to an active publication. The servicecontract may also provide for adjustments in such charges as effected byadjustments in the carrier's or conference's tariff of general applicabilityor essential terms publication. Each service contract shall describe anyrestriction(s) or limitation(s) which apply to such adjustments.</ITAG>The Commission declined to propose any regulations dealing with the issueof the level of liquidated damages. Although the Commission determinedthat it had the legal authority to issue rules in this area, it concludedthat such action was not warranted at the time.Comments on the Proposed Rule were received from thirty-eight interestedparties.

Instead, comments of certain partiesrepresentative of the basic carrier or shipper positions will be presentedand addressed. Unique comments of the remaining parties will also be noted.A. Carrier CommentsICCO recognizes that the Proposed Rule would prohibit that type of MFSclause it characterizes as the ``Crazy Eddie'' clause, <T3>i.e.</T3>, one that references another carrier's tariffs, service contracts,or other offers. It further recognizes that the Commission has indicatedthat service contracts containing <T3>de minimis </T3>liquidated damages for breach of a shipper volume commitmentviolate the proscriptions of the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act'' or``Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1701-1720. Nonetheless, ICCO continues to arguethat <T3>all </T3>MFS clauses should be prohibited (including those that referencea carrier's own tariffs or service contracts) and that the Commission shouldby rule set the limits on acceptable liquidated damages provisions.ICCO submits that ``Crazy Eddie'' clauses are contrary to section 10(b)(1)of the 1984 Act, which prohibits a carrier or conference from chargingdifferent compensation than the rates and charges that are shown in ``its''tariffs or service contracts.\7\<NOTE/> ICCO also contends that, to the extent the legislative historyof the 1984 Act indicates that Congress contemplated a carrier incorporatingby reference material in its service contract, it did not contemplate referenceto any other entity's rates, charges, or allowances. ICCO argues that Congressintended to apply longstanding tariff policy and tariff rate filing requirementsto service contracts. Among these requirements are those prohibiting acarrier's tariff from referencing rates in other tariffs, either of anothercarrier or the same carrier. This leads ICCO to conclude that Congresslikewise intended that service contracts not reference rates in other servicecontracts or tariffs. As a result, ICCO contends that <T3>all </T3>MFS clauses, not simply what it refers to as ``Crazy Eddie''clauses, should be prohibited.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Section 10(b) states, in part, that: No common carrier,either alone or in conjunction with any other person, directly or indirectly,may_(1) charge, demand, collect, or receive greater, less, or differentcompensation for the transportation or property or for any service in connectiontherewith than the rates and charges that are shown in its tariffs or servicecontracts * * * * 46 U.S.C. app. 1709(b)(1).ICCO further notes the requirement in section 10(b)(1) that rates be ``shown''in tariffs or service contracts. It argues, however, that the rates tobe charged under an MFS clause (whatever variety) are, at the time thecontract is filed, unknown and, therefore, not ``shown.''ICCO also asserts that MFS clauses, as a class, are contrary to section3(21) of the 1984 Act, because they result in service contracts that donot contain a ``certain'' rate.\8\<NOTE/> ICCO refers to several statements in the legislative historyto the 1984 Act that it argues demonstrates a Congressional intent thatservice contracts include specific numerical rates or rate formulas. Inaddition, ICCO contends that the Commission's proposal to allow referenceto a carrier's own tariff rates or service contract rates results froma misinterpretation of certain language in a Report of the Senate Committeeon Commerce, Science, and Transportation that accompanied S. 504, a predecessorto the 1984 Act.\9\<NOTE/> ICCO submits that this discussion only contemplates referenceto a carrier's ``additional charges'' or ``allowances,'' and not to thebase rate for a commodity. In this regard, ICCO notes that the Commission'sservice contract rules distinguish between ``rates'' and ``charges andallowances,'' citing 46 CFR 581.5(a)(3)(iii).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Section 3(21) states: ``service contract'' means a contractbetween a shipper and an ocean common carrier or conference in which theshipper makes a commitment to provide a certain minimum quantity of cargoover a fixed time period, and the ocean common carrier or conference commitsto a certain rate or rate schedule as well as a defined service level_suchas, assured space, transit time, port rotation, or similar service features;the contract may also specify provisions in the event of nonperformanceon the part of either party. 46 U.S.C. app. 1702(21).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The discussion at issue reads: The ``line-haul rate,''referred to in paragraph (4) includes all compensation to be paid and mustalso be disclosed. Many service contracts may provide for charges or allowancesfor transporting or handling the goods involved that may be different fromthose published in the otherwise applicable general tariff and, accordingly,any such variance must be identified in the line-haul rate disclosure.To the extent any contract charge or allowance is the same as that in thecarrier's or conference's general public tariff, incorporation by referencewill suffice. S. Rep. No. 3, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 31-32 (1983) (``SenateReport'').ICCO notes that MFS clauses were never mentioned_by a shipper or a memberof Congress_in the legislative history to the 1984 Act. Moreover, ICCOconsiders a prohibition of MFS clauses to be a modest step, in that servicecontracts with staged rates for staged volumes would still remain as options.ICCO believes that MFS clauses decrease rate stability and could frustratethe system of common carriage by undercutting the requirement that servicecontracts be made available to similarly situated shippers. ICCO claimsthat, at the point when a rate reduction is triggered under a contract,otherwise similarly situated shippers may have shipped different quantitiesof cargo and will, therefore, receive different rate treatment.As a technical matter, ICCO suggests that the last six words of proposedandSection; 581.1(f) could be construed as prohibiting only reference toanother <T3>ocean common carrier's </T3>rates and might, therefore, allow referenceto rates offered by tramps, non-vessel operating common carriers (``NVOCCs'')or other entities. ICCO would strike the words and substitute in theirplace: ``by any other carrier, conference, or other person or entity.''ICCO also states that even though the Commission intended to prohibit only``Cracy Eddie'' clauses, the wording of proposed andSection; 581.5(a)(4)would appear to proscribe all MFS clauses, consistent with ICCO's position.ICCO, therefore, suggests that the word ``only'' be inserted before theword ``additional'' in andSection; 581.5(a)(4).Finally, ICCO reaffirms its position that <T3>de minimis</T3> liquidated damages clauses should be prohibited byrule. ICCO recognizes that the Commission declined to address the issueof liquidated damages by rule partly because a staff survey indicated that6% of the contracts in a sample provided liquidated damages of $100 orless. ICCO questions whether $100 per container is an appropriate thresholdfor declaring damages to be <T3>de minimis</T3>, especially with regard to high rated commodities.In any event, ICCO believes that 6% is a sufficiently high number of servicecontracts to warrant rulemaking in this area. ICCO further argues thatwhen the level of damages in a service contract for shipper breach is verylow, or nothing, the stability which service contracts are intended toprovide is lost. <T3>De minimis</T3> liquidated damages provisions also allegedly providean incentive for unscrupulous shippers to engage in deceptive practices.ICCO believes that a rule regarding <T3>de minimis</T3> liquidated damages would be more effective than adjudicationon a case-by-case basis. It suggests that, at a minimum, such a rule shouldstate that:<ITAG tagnum="20">service contracts including clauses specifiying damages for cargoshortfall which the Commission finds to be </ITAG><T3>de minimis</T3> will be rejected.However, ICCO also supports a more specific rule that would create a rebuttablepresumption that, if a contract set less than a specified percentage offreight charges, the parties would have to explain to the Commission whythe level is a valid attempt to approximate damages. ICCO indicates thatit could accept a percentage of less than 75%, but also notes that theappropriate percentage should be determined after notice and opportunityfor comment.Most of the other Carrier Comments support the Proposed Rule but also urgethat it be expended to include all MFS clauses. In addition, most requestthat the Commission reconsider its decision to treat the level of liquidateddamages on a case-by-case basis and propose instead a rule of general applicabilityin this area. In support of this position, most of the Carrier Commentsraise the same or similar arguments as those presented by ICCO and theywill not, therefore, be repeated here. Others, however, offer additionalinsights which warrant specific mention.Some conferences note that the Commission's service contract rules requirethat if a service contract does not provide damages for termination orbreach, all cargo moving under the contract must be rerated at the otherwiseapplicable tariff rate_46 CFR 581.7(b)(2). They further point out thatthis provision was intended to prevent collusive action by the partiesto avoid contract commitments. They argue, however, that <T3>de minimis</T3> liquidated damages undercut the purpose of this rule.The Inter-American Freight Conference requests that if the Commission decidesnot to prohibit MFS clauses entirely, it should at least require such provisionsto state the specific carriers or conferences whose rates may affect theservice contract rates and that the rates involved must cover shipmentsof exactly the same commodity in the same volume as that specified in theservice contract.The New York Foreign Freight Forwarders and Brokers Association (``NYFFBA'')questions whether the Commission, as a procedural matter, properly disposedof ICCO's Petition. It contends that ICCO petitioned for a rule prohibiting<T3>all</T3> MFS clauses, and not for the rule the Commission proposedwhich would allow certain MFS clauses.NYFFBA also contends that the Proposed Rule is contrary to section 2 ofthe 1984 Act,\10\<NOTE/> in that it would allow large shippers to enjoy an advantageover small shippers. Moreover, NYFFBA submits that, if MFS clauses areallowed, more shippers will choose to use service contracts, thereby erodingthe common carriage system and perhaps reducing the effectiveness of theconference system.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Section 2 states, in part: The purposes of this Act are_(1)to establish a nondiscriminatory regulatory process for the common carriageof goods by water in the foreign commerce of the United States with a minimumof government intervention and regulatory costs * * *. 46 U.S.C. app. 1701(1).B.Shipper CommentsCommenters representing shippers, shippers' associations and related organizationsgenerally support the Commission's decision not to propose rules regardingliquidated damages. They also support that aspect of the Proposed Rulewhich would allow service contracts to reference a contracting carrier'stariff rates or other service contract rates. However, they oppose anylimitation on a service contract referencing other carriers' tariff ratesor service contracts.The National Industrial Transportation League (``NITL'') claims that contractsthat protect both parties from adverse price consequences based on changingmarket conditions are an accepted business and contractual practice. Unrestricted``meeting competition'' clauses (MFS clauses) are said to allow similarlysituated shippers to compete without changing carriers when a foreign competitorcan lower its transportation costs from another carrier. NITL argues thatsuch clauses also allow the contracting carrier the choice of claimingthe business if it elects to continue at the reduced rate, consistent withnormal business practices.First International Shippers Association believes that all of the mattersincluded in ICCO's Petition are commercial matters subject to negotiationand that the market should not be disrupted to create additional unfairadvantage for carriers. If basically contends that carriers will not agreeto MFS clauses unless it is to their commercial advantage and that carriersand shippers should have the ``right'' to negotiate these matters.The Wine and Spirits Shippers Association (``WSSA'') contends that Congressdid not intend for the Commisssion to regulate the commercial form andaspects of contract carriage. WSSA also argues that inclusion of MFS clauseswill put carriers on notice of the consequences of predatory rate reductions,thereby limiting their use and enhancing revenues for all carriers. Lastly,WSSA asserts that shippers' associations are unique, in that they do notown cargo and cannot compel their members to ship exclusively through them.If a non-contracting carrier or conference undercuts the contract rate,members of the association will allegedly be induced to use those lowerrates. WSSA believes that the net effect would be that the associationcould not meet its commitment, through no fault of its own.The American Institute for Shippers' Associations (``AISA'') advises thatit represents two types of shippers' associations_(1) ``full service''associations, which, it explains, handle all aspects of the freight movementas cooperatives, and (2) ``rate negotiator'' associations, which are saidto enter into rate arrangements on behald of their collective memberships.AISA contends that the Commission lacks jurisdiction to regulate the formand substantive content of service contracts, but particularly the pricingterms. AISA believes that the Commission's interpretation of the 1984 Act'sinitial policy goal, as a general policy exhortation only, is incorrect.It claims that Congress specifically identified service contracts as requiringa minimum of government regulatory interference, citing S. Rep. No. 3,98th Cong., 1st Sess. 18 (1983). It also avers that the level of ratescharged shippers was another area specifically identified as being outsidethe Commission's jurisdiction. <T3>Id. </T3>at 16, 18. This governmental non-intervention policy is allegedlyfurther underscored by the fact that the exclusive remedy for breach ofa service contract is an action in court, unless otherwise agreed. 46 U.S.C.app. 1707(c).AISA questions the Commission's determination that service contracts are``special'' contracts subject to regulation. It argues that the essentialterms set forth in section 8(c) of the 1984 Act are not mandatory, butmerely examples of terms that may be agreed to.\11\<NOTE/> AISA further contends that a pricing term is not mandatoryand that both the common law and the Uniform Commercial Code recognizecontracts which do not have specific pricing terms.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Section 8(c) states: SERVICE CONTRACTS._An ocean commoncarrier or conference may enter into a service contract with a shipperor shippers' association subject to the requirements of this Act. Exceptfor service contracts dealing with bulk cargo, forest products, recycledmetal scrap, waste paper, or paper waste, each contract entered into underthis subsection shall be filed confidentially with the Commission, andat the same time, a concise statement of its essential terms shall be filedwith the Commission and made available to the general public in tariffformat, and those essential terms shall be available to all shippers similarlysituated. The essential terms shall include_(1) The origin and destinationport ranges in the case of port-to-port movements, and the origin and destinationgeographic areas in the case of through intermodal movements; (2) The commodityor commodities involved; (3) The minimum volume; (4) The line-haul rate;(5) The duration; (6) Service commitments; and (7) The liquidated damagesfor nonperformance, if any.<ITAG tagnum="28">The exclusive remedy for a breach of a contract entered into underthis subsection shall be an action in an appropriate court, unless theparties otherwise agree. 46 U.S.C. app. 1707(c).</ITAG>AISA also takes issue with the conclusion that the works ``certain rateor rate schedule'' in sections 3(21) and 8(c) of the Act indicate a requirementthat service contract rates be an established, numerical value rate. Itargues that ``certain'' is not limited to previously existing events, butincludes items ``in law, capable of being identified or made known, withoutliability to mistake or ambiguity, from data already given.'' <T3>Black's Law Dictionary </T3>204 (5th ed. 1979). This definition issaid to be consistent with an alternative definition for ``certain'' in<T3>Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary </T3>182 (1975). AISA argues thatunder these definitions, MFS clauses contain certain rates, because therate can be determined from data which is specified in the contract. Thisinterpretation is allegedly consistent with statements in the Senate Reportimplying that service contracts need contain no provision concerning prices,on the condition that they provide meaningful commerical disclosure. S.Rep. No. 3, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 32 (1983).AISA also submits that the policy of allowing a carrier to reference itsown published rates but not the rates of its competitors is arbitrary.If the Commission is attempting to achieve rate certainty in service contracts,AISA claims that it must either uniformly prohibit or uniformly allow <T3>all </T3>MFS clauses.Further, AISA believes that the Commission's prohibition against cross-referencingof tariffs should not be applied to service contracts. AISA states thatthe policy against cross-referencing tariffs to reduce the burden on shippersdoes not apply in the case of a service contract, where the shipper negotiatesan MFS clause and voluntarily assumes the burden of ascertaining the marketrate. The 1984 Act is said to consistently treat tariff rates and servicecontracts as distinct systems.To the extent that rate instability is one of the reasons for prohibitingMFS clauses, AISA contends that no cause and effect relationship has beenestablished. Because AISA views complaints against MFS clauses as complaintswith the statute itself, it suggests that these issues await the resultsof the Commission's section 18(a) study. <T3>See </T3>46 U.S.C. app. 1717(a).AISA advises that the Department of Justice prohibits shippers' associationsfrom requiring their members to ship exclusively through the association.As a result, shippers' associations and particularly ``rate negotiator''associations are said to be susceptible to having their members raidedby a contracting carrier or conference or by competing carriers.AISA suggests that the Proposed Rule may inhibit the use of service contractsfor intermodal transportation. This allegedly may occur because inlandtransportation contracts do allow MFS clauses. AISA explains that if ashipper can obtain an MFS clause for the domestic portion of its transportationmovement but is unable to do so for the foreign portion, it may have nochoice but to use a carrier's tariff rates for the ocean transportationrather than enter into an intermodal service contract. This result is arguedto be contrary to the policy of the 1984 Act to develop and promote intermodalservices.AISA also maintains that the Proposed Rule is vague and does not clearlypermit that which the Commission intended to permit. AISA states, for example,that while proposed andSection; 581.5(a)(4) permits cross-referencing ofa contracting carrier's ``additional charges, surcharges, allowances, oradjustment factors * * *,'' this language does not make it clear that ``rates''may be cross-referenced. AISA also believes that the Proposed Rule is broaderthan that requested by ICCO, in that it prohibits incorporation by referenceof <T3>any </T3>essential term, not simply a rate term. It suggests, therefore,that the phrase ``or any other essential term(s)'' be deleted. Lastly,AISA takes issue with certain other wording of the Proposed Rule, in particularthe meaning of the phrases ``allow to be changed to adopt,'' ``direct match,formula or by any other means,'' and ``any other offering.''The Chemical Manufacturers Association (``CMA'') states that the Commissionhas overstepped its proper statutory role under section 8(c) of protectingthe rights of similarly situated shippers and involved itself in second-guessingthe business judgments of contracting parties to protect carriers and/ortheir competitors. It believes that certain statements by the Commissionin Docket No. 86-6, <T3>Service Contracts, </T3>52 FR 23989 (June 26, 1987), delineate itsproper role in this regard, and are consistent with the legislative historyof the 1984 Act. The requirement in the Commission's rules that similarlysituated shippers be notified of a change in essential terms due to theoperation of a contingency clause (<T3>e.g. </T3>an MFS clause) is said to be adequate to implement section8(c) of the 1984 Act.CMA further contends that the Commission has failed to explain why existingrules will not ensure compliance with section 10(b)(1) of the 1984 Act,which prohibits a carrier from charging a different rate from that shownin <T3>its </T3>tariff or service contract. It argues that a carrier thatadjusts a service contract rate in accordance with the terms of its contractis charging a rate as shown in its service contract for purposes of section10(b)(1).CMA views the Proposed Rule as designed to protect either the contractingcarrier from its own folly or a contracting carrier's competitors fromthat carrier's competition. Under either case, the rule is alleged to reflect``administrative paternalism.'' Moreover, to the extent the Proposed Ruleis intended to limit competition and stabilize rates, it allegedly couldbe considered as a form of price support for ocean carriers. CMA notesthat section 4(a)(7) of the 1984 Act \12\<NOTE/> gives conferences the ability to prohibit or regulate theirmembers' use of service contracts to limit competition, and CMA contendsthat the Commission should not assume this role.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ Section 4 states, in part: (a) Ocean Common Carriers_ThisAct applies to agreements by or among ocean common carriers to_* * * (7)regulate or prohibit their use of service contracts. 46 U.S.C. app. 1703(a)(7).CMA notes the Commission's statement that, as a practical matter, a carriersignatory to a service contract could meet the rate of a competitor bysimply adjusting its own <T3>tariff rates</T3>. It argues, however, that such an approach wouldmake service contracts more restrictive than general tariffs and woulddiscourage the use of service contracts.The American Paper Institute, Inc. (``API'') points out that the TranspacificWestbound Rate Agreement (``TWRA'') no longer enters into any service contractsand suggests that this alone is reason enough to deny the Petition. Italso questions how MFS clauses can be upsetting any balance between shipperand carrier interests. API claims that carrier opposition to the conceptof service contracts was rejected by Congress in enacting the 1984 Actand submits that the Commission should not now ``second-guess'' Congress.API further questions the Commission's reliance on a Report of the HouseCommittee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries (``House Report'') \1\\3\<NOTE/> for the proposition that Congress intended that the Commissiontake an active role in regulating service contracts. API suggests, rather,that the controlling legislative history is the Conference Report \1\\4\<NOTE/> and then the Senate Report. It reads the Conference Reportas indicating that service contracts can be employed in a discriminatoryfashion and are not, therefore, constrained in any way by common carriageconcepts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ H.R. Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 600, 98th Cong., 2nd Sess. (1984)(``Conference Report'').API takes issue with the Commission's interpretation of the statement_``tothe extent any contract charge or allowance is the same as that in thecarrier's or conference's general public tariff, incorporation by referencewill suffice.'' Senate Report at 32. This language is allegedly not meant``* * * to tie the referenced tariff to any particular carrier or conference'srate, but rather to emphasize that incorporation by reference will be allowedfor a `general public tariff.' '' After citing additional language in theSenate Report, API concludes that the concern of Congress was not <T3>whose </T3>rates are referenced, but rather that publicly availablerates be referenced.API furthers suggests that the Commissions reliance on precedent undersection 18(b)(3) of the Shipping Act, 1916, 46 U.S.C. 817(b)(3) (repealed1984), is inapposite to service contracts, which are entirely new underthe 1984 Act and are intended to provide certain preferences.Du Pont claims that the definition set forth in proposed andSection; 581.1(f)is not a ``most-favored-shipper'' clause, but rather a ``meeting competition''clause. It submits that valid ``meeting competition'' clauses do not resultin a lack of mutuality of consideration. To the contrary, Du Pont suggeststhat the common law recognizes contracts that provide relief from adverseprice consequences based on changing market conditions as valid. Du Pontalso questions ICCO's references to a lack of balance or the overwhelmingmarket power of shippers over carriers, especially in light of the factthat the TWRA has <T3>no </T3>service contracts, with or without ``meeting competition''clauses.Du Pont further proposes that the Proposed Rule be modified so that shipperscould use only written offers from comparable carriers that are firmlycommitted, in writing, to provide the service, either under a tariff orunder a service contract, if the contract carrier elects not to continueto carry the cargo. Moreover, Du Pont proposes to preserve the statutoryrights of similarly situated shippers by treating a carrier's decisionto meet competition as a new, limited service contract, thereby affordinga 30-day period for similarly situated shippers to exercise their ``me-too''rights.Subaru fully supports the Proposed Rule as a fair and equitable solutionto the concerns raised by ICCO's Petition. It believes that if carriersare free to adjust rates in a service contract upward (by reference toa general rate increase), they should also be free to allow reductions,when market conditions dictate. In addition, Subaru notes that the propertime for a carrier to address an MFS clause is at the time the contractis negotiated, because such a provision need not be included if a carrierdoes not desire it.The National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America, Inc.(``NCBFAA'') likewise supports the Proposed Rule. It notes that, historically,after a shipper executes a service contract, conferences have adjustedrates downward to a point where a non-signatory shipper has a lower ratethan a competing signatory. In addition, NCBFAA asserts that after a shippertenders cargo for a period of time and establishes its ability to generatea certain volume of cargo, carriers, may approach the shipper and seekto deal directly with it by offering a lower than contract rate. The ProposedRule is seen as preventing this conduct.C. Other CommentersSenator Breaux advises that service contracts were not intended to replacethe system of common carriage in ocean transportation. He states that theywere intended to provide greater stability to ocean freight rates and toenable both shippers and carriers to make mutual commitments which wouldadd greater predictability to rates, volume and service. Senator Breauxfurther states that the essence of service contracts is the long natureof these commitments as opposed to the unpredictable tendering of cargounder tariff rates that may fluctuate.Congressman Jones expresses support for the standards in the Proposed Rulethat define, by exclusion, what may be considered an acceptable servicecontract. He also notes the importance of the Commission's reiterationof its policy to require meaningful rate and service commitments for shippersand meaningful service commitments for carriers. Congressman Jones viewsthe Proposed Rule as reducing the burden on the Commission if MSF clauseswere allowed and numerous contract amendments were filed with it.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>MFS clauses are provisions in service contracts that permit the contractrate to vary based on some external activity or event. There are essentiallythree different types of MFS clauses. The first allows a service contractto meet or adopt any rate offered by the contracting carrier or conferencein its tariffs or service contracts. The second allows the contract tomeet the rates of other carriers or conferences, whether in tariffs orservice contracts. The last category permits changes to the contract ratebased on unpublished offers of other carriers.ICCO originally petitioned the Commission for a rule that would prohibitall three forms of MFS clauses. ICCO also requested a rule establishinga minimally acceptable level for liquidated damages provisions in servicecontracts for a shipper breach of its volume commitment. The Proposed Rule would have allowed a carrier's service contract rateto be adjusted based on its own tariff rates or service contract rates.Reference to other carriers' rates or offers would have been prohibited.However, the Commission also suggested that a basis might exist to distinguishand permit MFS clauses referencing other carriers' rates. In addition,the Commission declined to issue a rule addressing the acceptable levelof liquidated damages, but instead indicated that it would deal with thatissue on a case-by-case basis. After consideration of all the comments to the Proposed Rule, the Commissionhas determined to prohibit only those MFS clauses that allow a servicecontract rate to meet unpublished offers of carriers or conferences. Inaddition, the Commission notes that the issue of <T3>de minimis </T3>liquidated damages was outside the scope of the ProposedRule. Nonetheless, because this issue was reargued by some commenters,the Commission will take this opportunity to reaffirm its earlier decision.The reasons for these determinations follow, with the latter subject treatedfirst. Liquidated damages are sums a party to a contract agrees to pay to theother party in the event a promise is breached, and are good faith effortsto estimate the actual damages which might ensue, taking into account thedifficulties in proving actual damages. <T3>See Black's Law Dictionary </T3>353 (5th ed. 1979). The appropriatenessof any given liquidated damages provision is generally judged on its ownunique circumstances. In the area of service contracts for ocean transportation,liquidated damages are most often included to address the situation ofa shipper failing to meet its volume commitment. However, given the shipper,carrier, commodity, and trade characteristics that influence the determinationof liquidated damages, it may be particularly difficult to quantify ina universally applicable rule, what might be an acceptable level of liquidateddamages. The Commission has never stated, however, that it lacks authority to issueregulations concerning <T3>de minimis </T3>liquidated damages. In fact, in the Supplemental Informationto the Proposed Rule, the Commission stated that, although it<ITAG tagnum="20">* * * lacks the authority to directly regulate the use of liquidateddamages provisions [this] does not necessarily mean that the Commissionis without authority to preclude service contract liquidated damages provisionswhich may permit evasion of the otherwise applicable tariff rate contraryto the 1984 Act and the policies underlying it, regardless of whether bothparties to the contract willingly or unwillingly agree to those provisions.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Proposed Rule at 28, 29. In this regard, the Commission noted thatit would be extremely difficult to devise ``an efficient and appropriateregulatory requirement'' and that it would only consider such a courseof action if there were a showing that ``the use of <T3>de minimis </T3>liquidated damages clauses is widespread and presentsa serious problem that threatens the viability of the overall legislativescheme of the 1984 Act.'' Although the Commission recognized that there is a potential for illusorycontracting through the use of <T3>de minimis </T3>liquidated damages clauses and that such contractingmay on occasion have occurred, it did not find such contracting to havebeen shown to be of sufficient magnitude to warrant the significant restrictionson service contracting that effective regulation would entail. ProposedRule at 30. In this connection, the Commission also noted a random surveyof service contracts by its staff that indicted that only 6% of the contractsreviewed had liquidated damages provisions at less than a level that mightbe considered clearly <T3>de minimis. </T3>The Commission nevertheless advised that it wouldclosely scrutinize filed service contracts and reject any with potentiallylow levels of liquidated damages.\15\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ As the Commission noted: * * * it is the stated policyof the Commission to require meaningful rate and volume commitments onthe part of the shipper and meaningful service commitments on the partof the carrier in all service contracts entered into under the authorityof section 8(c) of the 1984 Act. The Commission will scrutinize contractscarefully at the time of filing to ensure that they contain such commitments,pursuant to the requirements of 46 CFR 581.1(n). Failure to comply withthe requirements of 46 CFR 581.1(n), as herein interpreted, will resultin the rejection of the contract pursuant to 46 CFR 581.8 or other appropriateCommission action. Proposed Rule at 27.No new facts or arguments have been presented that persuade the Commissionto alter its earlier determination. Moreover, more recent Commission staffsurveys reveal only about seven to nine percent of the service contractsreviewed having provisions for deadfreight at a level that might be consideredclearly <T3>de minimis. </T3>The Commission therefore will treat such matters ona case-by-case basis. The Commission intends to be particularly vigilantin this regard, and intends to require parties to any service contractcontaining suspect levels of liquidated damages to justify their provisions.It is the Commission's belief that under certain circumstances liquidateddamages of an extremely minimal amount could violate section 10(a)(1) ofthe 1984 Act and may also indicate a failure of consideration on the partof the shipper, calling into question whether the arrangement is indeeda ``contract.''ICCO's Petition indicated that MFS clauses may, in certain instances, betriggered not only by some rate offer contained in a tariff or servicecontract, but also by other means, including telephone quotes. The Commissionconcluded, in issuing the Proposed Rule, that this type of MFS clause appearedto be contrary to section 8(c) of the 1984 Act. The Commission explainedthat tying a service contract rate to an unpublished, nonbinding rate ``offer,''that cannot be readily ascertained by interested third parties, did notappear to provide the ``meaningful commercial disclosure'' contemplatedby Congress. Proposed Rule at 22 and 27. The only two commenters that directly addressed this type of MFS clauserepresented shipper interests. Notwithstanding their predeliction in favorof MFS clauses generally, these commenters concede that clauses tied tounpublished offers might be legally prohibited by the Commission. Thus,API states that, to the extent an MFS clause references an unpublishedand unknown rate which is not thereafter filed with the Commission, prohibitionwould constitute a ``viable enforcement action designed to provide meaningfulcommercial disclosure.'' Likewise, AISA indicates that it could supporta regulation prohibiting reference to unpublished offers as being withinthe Commission's jurisdiction to require rate certainty. The Commission concludes that service contract provisions that allow acontract rate to match a vague, unwritten and unpublished offer of someother carrier are unlawful and should be, therefore, prohibited. Thesetypes of provisions do not provide <T3>any </T3>commercial disclosure to other interested parties, let alonethe meaningful commercial disclosure required by section 8(c) of the Act.Accordingly, the Proposed Rule has been modified to clarify that this typeof MFS clause will no longer be countenanced. Specific language will beadded to 46 CFR 581.5(a)(3)(iii) to indicate that the ``contract rate''essential term may not be changed based on rate offers of other carriersnot published in a tariff or service contract.\16\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ The Final Rule thus amends existing paragraph (a)(3)of andSection; 581.5, rather than adding several new paragraphs to Part 581,as had originally been proposed. As for the remaining two types of MFS clauses, there is little or no practicaldifference between them. A service contract that references a carrier'sown tariff or service contracts and a contract that references rates containedin other carriers' tarriffs or service contracts both operate in a similarmanner. The only question is whether the kinds of materials to which theyrefer (<T3>i.e., </T3>one's own rates versus the rates of others) have been somehowdistinguished by statute or by Congressional intent. Upon review of the comments and further consideration of the relevant language,the Commission does not believe that the Senate Report can serve as a sufficientbasis to distinguish between these two types of MFS clauses.\17\<NOTE/> The language in this Report discussing incorporation by referenceto a carrier's general public tariff makes reference only to a carrier'sadditional ``charges'' or ``allowances'' and not the base rate for thecommodity covered by the contract. Therefore, because the Senate Reportdoes not distinguish between MFS clauses referencing a carrier's own ratesand those referencing other carriers' rates, both types of clauses mustbe assessed together against other possible restrictions contained in the1984 Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ The pertinent section of the Senate Report states: The``line-haul rate,'' referred to in paragraph (4) includes all compensationto be paid and must also be disclosed. Many service contracts may providefor charges or allowances for transporting and handling the goods involvedthat may be different from those published in the otherwise applicablegeneral tariff and, accordingly, any such variance must be identified inthe line-haul rate disclosure. To the extent any contract charge or allowanceis the same as that in the carrier's or conference's general public tariff,incorporation by reference will suffice. Senate Report at 31, 32. ICCO has argued that service contracts containing MFS clauses do not contain``certain'' rates for purposes of section 3(21) of the 1984 Act. The Commissiondisagrees. As we noted in the Proposed Rule, a contract must be draftedso as to permit a person to ascertain the agreed upon rate from the faceof the document or a specified rate schedule. The initial rate to be chargedunder a contract containing an MFS clause is a specific, numerical rateand is, therefore, ``certain'' for section 3(21) purposes. Moreover, tothe extent that that rate is subsequently adjusted based upon circumstancesspecifically set forth in the MFS clause, that ``adjusted'' rate is capableof being ascertained from objective data, although published elsewhere.In fact, when such a contingency is invoked, the Commission's rules alreadyrequire that this fact must be brought to the Commission's attention. 46CFR 581.3(a)(3)(viii) and 581.5(b)(1). At all times, the applicable rateunder a contract with an MFS clause will be ascertainable and known tothe Commission. ICCO has also argued that MFS clauses that reference other carriers' ratesviolate section 10(b)(1) of the 1984 Act. The Commission again disagrees,after full consideration of all the comments and reexamination of the applicablestatutory language. A carrier that adjusts a service contract rate in accordancewith an MFS clause referencing other carriers' rates is charging a rate``shown in its service contract.'' Although the rate ultimately chargedmay be affected by another carrier's rates, the method of determining theservice contract rate is stated in the contracting carrier's service contract.And, as indicated above, that rate is ascertainable from objective data.The Commission does not therefore believe that section 10(b)(1) can beused to distinguish between acceptable MFS clauses.One further issue raised in the Supplemental Information to the ProposedRule is whether MFS clauses are in any way inconsistent with the Commission'spast policy and precedent which precluded a carrier's tariff from referencingrates published in any other carrier's tariff.\18\<NOTE/> The Commission noted that this policy was designed to lessenthe burden on shippers to refer to other carriers' tariffs to determineapplicable freight rates. However, given the ``greater commercial freedomsservice contracts appear to have been intended to provide,'' the Commissionspecifically recognized that ``a direct application of tariff case lawand policy to service contracts may be inappropriate.'' Proposed Rule at28. For the reasons stated below, the Commission finds the tariff, no-cross-referencingpolicy to be not directly applicable to service contracts. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ Although the Commission raised the question of the applicabilityof tariff rules and precedent in the context of MFS clauses that referenceother carriers' rates, several commenters have suggested that these argumentsapply with equal force to MFS clauses that reference a carrier's own rates.The relevant tariff rules, 46 CFR 580.6(k)(2), 580.5(g), and 580.13(b),allegedly reflect a longstanding Commission policy of prohibiting a carrierfrom incorporating by reference <T3>any </T3>rates, even its own. In the process leading up to enactment of the 1984 Act, the issue of whetherto require tariff filing at all was thoroughly debated. Ultimately, Congressdecided to continue the system of tariff filing and with it the Commission'sprior interpretation and rules. However, there is no clear indication thatCongress at any time intended that the Commission's practices <T3>vis-a-vis </T3>service contracts were to track its existing tarifffiling practices.\19\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ There is language in the Senate Report to the effectthat ``* * * a service contract must be filed and is subject to the tarifffiling requirements and common carrier obligations of the bill.'' SenateReport at 21. However, the ``tariff filing requirement * * * of the bill''to which the Report refers appear to be any requirement that a statementof the essential terms of a service contract be ``made available to thegeneral public in tariff format.'' <T3>See </T3>section 8(c). Moreover, Congress specifically distinguished service contracts from ratesin tariffs. The Conference Report notes that section 8(a) of the Act ``** * does not require service contracts to be filed in tariffs.'' ConferenceReport at 29. As a result, conferences are not required to permit theirmembers a right of independent action on service contracts pursuant tosection 5(b)(8). <T3>Id. </T3>Tariff rates are open to all and must be employed in a non-discriminatorymanner. However, service contracts may favor certain shippers and are expresslyexempted from certain statutory prohibitions against discrimination. <T3>See e.g. </T3>46 U.S.C. app. 1709(b) (6) and (11). Further support for not applying the tariff, ``no cross-referencing'' policyto service contracts can be drawn from the policy underlying the rule itself.As the Commission noted in the Supplementary Information, the reason thetariff policy was adopted was to lessen the burden on a shipper to ascertainthe applicable rate. However, in the case of an MFS clause, as noted inshipper comments, it is the shipper who negotiates the clause and voluntarilyassumes the burden of becoming aware of other rates that might triggerthe clause. Based on the foregoing, the Commission cannot find that MFS clauses thatreference published rates of the same or other carriers are <T3>per se </T3>contrary to the Shipping Act of 1984 or otherwise warrantregulation. The Commission will not, therefore, adopt any rules that wouldprohibit such clauses. The Commission further concludes, however, thatMFS clauses referencing unpublished offers are contrary to section 8(c)of the 1984 Act, and will modify its service contract regulations to precludesuch provisions. The Federal Maritime Commission has determined that this rule is not a``major rule'' as defined in Executive Order 12291, 46 FR 12193, February27, 1981, because it will not result in: (1) An annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, orgeographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovations, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. The Chairman of the Commission certifies pursuant to section 605(b) ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq., </T3>that this Rule will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small organizational units, and small governmentaljurisdictions. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 581 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Contracts, Maritime carriers, Ratesand fares.
