Gorbachev was overwhelmingly electedpresident today by the country's new congress, winning more than 95percent of the vote.   The sole candidate, Gorbachev received 2,123 of the 2,210 votescast, Yuri A. Osipyan, chairman of the commission that counted theballots, reported during nationally televised proceedings ofCongress of People's Deputies. Eighty-seven deputies voted againstthe Communist Party chief, Osipyan said.   Gorbachev, who was unanimously elected president on Oct. 1 bythe Supreme Soviet, replacing Andrei A. Gromyko, secured 95.6percent of the votes cast by deputies in today's secret balloting,Osipyan said.   Earlier today the congress, the first competitively electedSoviet parliament, nominated Gorbachev as the sole candidate afterrejecting demands he first report on his accomplishments andfailures.   Maverick communist Boris N. Yeltsin withdrew his nomination bid.   A little-known Leningrad deputy, Alexander Obolensky, offeredhimself as an alternative to Gorbachev, but two-thirds of the2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies rejected him.   Obolensky, who is not a member of the ruling Communist Party,said he knew he had little chance of winning the nomination butwanted to ``set a precedent of an alternative.''   Yeltsin, whose anti-etablishment campaign garnered 90 percent ofthe vote in an election in Moscow, took himself out of the running,saying simply ``I'm withdrawing myself.'' He said as a member ofthe party's Central Committtee he was bound by the committee'sdecision to support Gorbachev's election.   Before the vote, human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov saidhe would not take part in the secret balloting for the presidency.   ``We can't let these elections just be a formality,'' the 1975Nobel Peace Prize winner said. Sakharov was one of four deputieswho abstained when the congress voted to place Gorbachev's name onthe ballot.   Noone voted against Gorbachev's nomination.   Estonian activist Marju Lauristen offered Gorbachev her vote oncondition he answer some tough questions first. For instance, shewanted to know who in the ruling Politburo knew of plans to usetroops to break up a pro-independence demonstration in SovietGeorgia, and how soon Gorbachev learned of the plans.   Nineteen people died in the ensuing clash.   Others demanded explanations of privileges enjoyed by Sovietleaders and of a decree banning statements that discreditauthorities.   As the inaugural session opened, the congress immediatelyplunged into spirited debate over its agenda and powers. The lackof parliamentary experience showed.   Gorbachev led the proceedings, sitting behind two microphoneswith a giant statue of Vladimir I. Lenin at his back. Hearbitrarily called for votes on some procedural issues whileignoring others. Only a few deputies objected.   At one point, the Soviet president took the microphone for 20minutes, and in one of his most impassioned political speeches,pledged not to abuse power if re-elected.   Gorbachev vowed ``to pursue the line of democracy until the veryend so that what has happened in this country will never again berepeated.'' His remark was an obvious reference to pastauthoritarian Soviet regimes.   One of the first deputies to take the floor was Sakharov, whowas banished from Moscow until December 1986 for human rightsactivities.   Sakharov praised Gorbachev for changing the face of Sovietsociety and said he should be re-elected president but demandedthat Gorbachev first give congress an account of the mistakes andachievements of his reform efforts.   Sakharov also argued for changing the agenda of the congress,chosen in the country's first contested elections in seven decades.He said the congress should act as the nation's principallaw-making body. That is supposed to be the job of a new 542-memberSupreme Soviet being elected by the congress.   Gorbachev cut Sakharov off after five minutes, set a time limiton subsequent speakers, and moved to end debate on the agenda.   The agenda was adopted by a wide margin. However, in a countrywhere legislative proceedings traditionally have been by unanimousconsent, there were 379 votes against the agenda and nineabstentions.   Not all parliamentarians were happy with the morning session.   ``It's not at all democratic,'' said Egidijus Klumbys, a memberof the Lithuanian reform group Sajudis. Klumbys said he doubtedother sessions would be different.   At least 80 percent of the deputies are Communist Party members,but a small band of reformers assured the congress will differsharply from the docile, rubber-stamp assemblies of the past.   Formally, the congress has little power other than to elect thepresident and members of the Supreme Soviet and review thepresident's appointments for top government posts.   Two-thirds of the delegates were chosen by voters and the restwere chosen by official organizations.</TEXT></DOC>
