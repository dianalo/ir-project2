Justice Scaliagot some of this burden off his chest in a rare public speechon Tuesday.   Speaking at George Washington Law School, Justice Scaliaput the problem plainly: &quot;You have a process in which theSenate takes nominees and asks them a whole list ofquestions. `Judge so-and-so, do you think this right is inthe Constitution?'&quot; This, he said, &quot;is an absurd spectacle.You don't look for a good lawyer, somebody who knows how toread a text, who asserts the tradition that goes behind thattext, who has a good legal mind.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;But you ask whatever the current hot issue is. You haveto go through a whole litany of those rights that the peoplewant right away to put in their Constitution.&quot; Thistransformation of judges into politicians &quot;is inevitable oncepeople come to believe&quot; that the Constitution is &quot;an evolvingdocument, an empty bottle that you fill up as you please,&quot; hesaid.   Justice Scalia's critique of the Borking process contrastswith comments from Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,who now says the gutter politics of judicial nominations isthe President's fault. He proposes &quot;meaningful consultations&quot;on nominations, meaning Democratic vetoes of nominees.   Liberals have clearly decided that since they can't winthe White House they'll treat presidential nominations offederal judges as mainly interest-group politics. One result,as Justice Scalia has said, is that many people think a courtcase is well or badly decided based on whether thepolitically sympathetic party wins -- regardless of what thelaw is.   INS v. Elias-Zacarias, which the Justices decided onJanuary 22, is a perfect example. A Guatemalan tried to getasylum in the U.S. based on a threat from guerrillas that heshould join their armed forces. The typical headline on theopinion was: &quot;Supreme Court Limits Political Asylum.&quot; Ifeditors didn't think judges were mini-legislators, theheadline would have read: &quot;Supreme Court Says Federal StatuteLimits Political Asylum.&quot;   The issue in the case was not how the Justices felt aboutrefugees, but about the meaning of the Immigration andNationality Act, 8 U.S.C. Section 1101(a)(42). This law,which the Court didn't write, says that a refugee can getasylum if there is &quot;a well-founded fear of persecution onaccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in aparticular social group, or political opinion.&quot;   Lawyers for Jairo Elias-Zacarias argued that he qualifiedfor asylum, but in a 6-3 opinion Justice Scalia said that thephrase, &quot;on account of . . . political opinion,&quot; has a plainmeaning that doesn't cover this case. There was no evidencethat he opposed joining the guerrillas because he helddifferent political views; it could have been a &quot;fear ofcombat, a desire to remain with one's family and friends, adesire to earn a better living in civilian life.&quot;   As a political matter, we'd guess that a Senator Scaliawould vote for legislating a far more open asylum policy. Butuntil Congress changes the law, the Supreme Court's only jobis to enforce the clear language of the statute.   A generation of activist judges acting like legislatorsdid much to reduce the nobility of law to so much politics.Much of the public now regards a trip to the courthouse as acrapshoot. This public cynicism is one result of the era ofEarl Warren and William Brennan. Justice Scalia is right towant judges only to judge, and to be judged by Congress onlyas judges.</TEXT></DOC>
