The bill, introduced by Sens. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) and Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.) defines insider trading as direct or indirect theft and use of information that violates &quot;any fiduciary, contractual, employment, personal or other relationship of trust and confidence.&quot;    The measure also seeks to combat the transmission of nonpublic information in the form of stock tips, making both those who give the tip and those who receive it liable to civil and criminal penalties. Tipping nonpublic information to a third party in order to stimulate trading of a security would also be barred.    Under the legislation, traders who possessed nonpublic information and who entered into a transaction on a related security would be presumed to have violated the law unless they could prove that within their firm there existed an effective &quot;Chinese Wall&quot; between the information and the transaction. A &quot;Chinese Wall&quot; is a barrier imposed by an institution preventing one of its divisions from communicating nonpublic information to another division.    Employers who didn't participate in or induce illegal actions wouldn't be liable for the insider trading abuses of an employee.    The proposed legislation, described by one of its framers as a &quot;living&quot; measure, would empower the Securities and Exchange Commission to create additional rules consistent with the provisions of the bill.    Currently, the Securities and Exchange Commission relies on case-by-case litigation to enforce its theory of &quot;misappropriation&quot; of nonpublic information. The principle holds that it is illegal to trade on material, nonpublic information that has been misappropriated or obtained in breach of a fidiciary duty.    But some lawmakers note that the misappropriation theory faces a key test in a pending Supreme Court case involving R. Foster Winans, a former Wall Street Journal reporter. Mr. Winans is accused with two other individuals of conspiring to profit from advance knowledge of Journal articles. Some lawyers say the court may rule that the misappropriation theory hasn't been adequately developed to provide a proper legal guideline for use in criminal cases.    At a hearing on the bill yesterday before the Securities Subcommittee, Sen. William Proxmire (D., Wis.), chairman of the parent Senate Banking Committee, said that Congress could count on his support for a &quot;tough bill&quot; to crack down on insider trading abuses, so long as such a measure wouldn't hamper the SEC's current enforcement powers.    He added that laying down a set definition of insider trading is &quot;very, very, very tricky&quot; because it would encourage lawyers to carve out exceptions to the law. &quot;If there's a loophole to be found, they'll find it,&quot; he said.    On the House side, Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has also expressed reservations about fixing a specific definition of insider trading. An aide to Rep. Dingell said, &quot;He will look at what the Supreme Court does in the Winans case, but at this point he doesn't think anything is broken and needs fixing.&quot; The Supreme Court isn't likely to rule on the case before next spring. </TEXT></DOC>
