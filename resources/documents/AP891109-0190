President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arescheduled to hold shipboard meetings off Malta on Dec. 2-3.   Ambassador Sally Novetzke, who presented her credentialsThursday to President Vincent Tabone, also said she considers itunlikely any meeting would be arranged between Bush and Libyanleader Moammar Gadhafi during the summit.   The Socialist Party leader and former prime minister, KarmenuMifsud Bonnici, on Wednesday called on the government to try toarrange a Bush-Gadhafi meeting in an effort ``to reduce tensionsbetween the two countries.''   The Bush administration has said previously it was not preparedto hold talks with Libya. It said last month that Libya is stillproviding funds, weapons, haven and training facilities toterrorists.   Bonnici was the prime minister in April 1986, when Malta gaveLibya advance warning of the U.S. air raids on the Libyan cities ofBenghazi and Tripoli.   However, Libya apparently did not act on the information.Then-President Reagan said the bombing raids were intended topunish Libya for its alleged support of international terrorism.   The Socialists were voted out in 1986 after 16 years in powerand the conservative government of Prime Minister Eddie FenechAdami has moved closer to the United States and Western Europe.   Mrs. Novetzke said the fact that Libyans are allowed to freelyvisit Malta does not pose any special security risk for the summit.``It is not a worry,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
