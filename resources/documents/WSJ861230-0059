Jan Brener and Elaine Ordower, who teach voice control, list a whole bunch of awful things that can happen from overuse of the vocal chords. But happily, these problems, as with other ills that Americans bring on themselves through excess, can be avoided with proper care. The two suggest more use of the abdominal diaphragm, or maybe learning to whistle instead of yell. Other possibilities, we suppose, would be to go to bed early on New Year's Eve or to leave the TV set turned off on Super Bowl Sunday. </TEXT></DOC>
