It achievesautomatic control in plants involving complex processes which cannotbe represented by a model without difficulty, embodies EIXAX, an AI tool,as its heart, and is intended to be a system that can be developed, fabricated,and maintained by users who are acquainted with the processes. The featuresof this system are as follows: A numeric calculus scheme and an statisticalanalysis scheme are systematically combined and implemented on a 32-bitmicrocomputer; basic application programs and rules are embodied in thesystem so that the system can be readily used.
