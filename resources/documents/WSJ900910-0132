A conservativereport -- issued, incidentally, by the Department of Energy-- concludes that renewables could provide nearly 30% of ourtotal energy supply. Yet federal research and developmentbudgets for renewable technologies have taken draconian cuts,dropping to less than $95 million from $557 million in thepast decade (non-adjusted).   Concerted federal efforts to encourage &quot;economies ofscale&quot; in the development of renewables, combined withincreased emphasis on energy efficiency, could mitigatesignificantly the strategic consequences of Saddam Hussein'sbelligerence.   Michael L. Marvin   Director   Governmental Affairs   American Wind Energy Association   Washington   ---   I was surprised and disappointed, in reading your Aug. 17page-one article on &quot;Energy Options,&quot; to see not one mentionof the potential contribution of ethanol from renewableagricultural resources as a fuel enhancer and extender. Thisis a one-billion-gallon-per-year industry today. Americanfarmers certainly have the capacity and the desire to make aneven greater contribution to reducing America's reliance onimported oil for motor fuel. With today's corn prices, oilprices and government incentives the production of ethanolfrom grain is profitable. This home-grown resource should notbe ignored in responding to our current energy problems.   Donald M. Senechal   Danvers, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
