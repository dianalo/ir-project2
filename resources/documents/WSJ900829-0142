The railroad, real estate and natural-resources concernlast month announced a refinancing plan for its $780 millionof 16% pay-in-kind senior subordinated debentures, due in2003.</LP><TEXT>   As part of that plan, the company said it would offerdebenture holders a chance to swap $1,000 face value of thedebentures for Santa Fe Pacific common stock valued at$1,060, up to a maximum of $200 million face value of thedebentures. Santa Fe shares closed at $19.625 on July 30, theday the swap offer was publicly announced; the company saidthe exchange would be made based on a minimum price of $18 ashare.   But Santa Fe shares -- hammered by the market's downturn-- have declined sharply to a price below the earlierminimum.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Santa Fe shares closed at $15.625, down 75 cents.   The company said that about $145 million principal amountof debentures had been tendered before the originalexpiration date of 12:01 a.m. yesterday. &quot;Rather than proceedwith the exchange of those debentures,&quot; the company said, &quot;wefelt that in fairness to our investors we should modify theoffer.&quot;   In addition to reducing the exchange value to reflect aminimum share price of $15 each, the company extended theoffer to 12:01 a.m. Sept. 12. As in the earlier offer, theactual exchange value will be based on the average of theshare's closing price for the 10 trading days prior to theoffer's expiration.   Yesterday's moves suggest that unless the company's stockshows a sharp upturn, Santa Fe will issue more common sharesin the swap than it had originally anticipated.   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,Santa Fe's 16% senior subordinated debentures closed$103.625, up $1.50.</TEXT></DOC>
