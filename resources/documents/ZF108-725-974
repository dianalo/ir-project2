It is best to start as close to the top asyou can get.andP;  Start with &quot;the leader.&quot;andP;  The person that everybody else in thecompany looks up to - not necessarily the CEO.andP;  If that person uses your EIS,everybody is going to want it.andM;What are your user's needs? There are different levels, different depths toan EIS.andP;  The deeper you go, the more difficult to implement it becomes.andO;Before you start the design, determine how deep you intend to go.andP;  Meet withyour development team.andP;  Discuss the problem and decide which level is thedeepest your users will ever go.andP;  That is the target of your design.andP;  Thelevels are:andM;1.andP;  electronic delivery of current reportsandM;2.andP;  customized reportsandM;- This requires manipulation of (mostly, at least)andM;existing data.andM;3.andP;  variance analysisandM;- Requires new data.andM;4.andP;  investigation (What if?&quot; analysis)andM;- Requires new relationships among the data.andM;5.andP;  modelingandM;- Requires a whole new scenario.andM;The objective is to go as deep as necessary, but no further.andP;  Keep in mindthat you must design for the long term  but your system will probably beevaluated in the short term.andP;  Wayne suggests you consider two points in time:after the first six months, and three years out.andM;&quot;Create a vision of your system.&quot; What do you want it to be? How will itlook? What will it provide? Do that for the initial system you plan todeliver and for the system as it will be 3 years hence.andP;  Then consider whatwill have to be done to make your vision a reality.andM;Among the many things to consider - others will be unique to yourorganization and your users - are:andM;1.andP;  How many users do you anticipate?andM;2.andP;  What is the level of &quot;information sophistication&quot; ofandM;your users?andM;3.andP;  Will they need cross-function use?andM;4.andP;  Will they need cross-division use?andM;5.andP;  How diverse must the report formats be?andM;6.andP;  How diverse will the data be?andM;7.andP;  What size do you reasonably expect your EISandM;support staff to be?andM;- The size will limit the amount of support youandM;can provide.andP;  The average size is 3 (range is 2andM;to 4) for 15 to 45 users.andM;8.andP;  List the products (hardware and software) thatandM;you know (a priori) must be included in yourandM;design.andM;- They may (probably will) become constraints.andM;9.andP;  List your data sources.andM;- Identify those to which access may be difficult.andM;10.andP;  List all critical failure factors.andM;Complete that list before you look at any technology (available packages).andO;Different technologies support different needs.andP;  If you know your needs, youwill be in a better position to judge which technologies satisfy them.andM;Factor into your design the unique characteristics of your organization.andO;Unfortunately, they may hinder your plans.andM;Wayne presented a helpful formula:andM;FUNCTIONALITY = TECHNOLOGY + SUPPORTandM;&quot;Functionality&quot; represents the benefits to the user.andP;  They can be limited -or expanded  - by the technology you choose, whether you make or buy thattechnology, and by the amount of support you can provide.andM;Other considerations that should be contemplated are:andM;*  Will you use set formats and fill in the data? If youandM;do, the formats must be maintained.andP;  Every timeandM;someone wants something different, you have to addandM;another format.andM;*  Will you create a new report every time a report isandM;requested? In that case, no formats have to beandM;maintained, but the amount of work done for eachandM;request is much larger.andP;  An important point thisandM;method provides the user with great flexibility.andP;  AnyandM;report can be requested, no matter how unique it isandM;(providing the data is available).andM;*  Can you directly access the files? Or, are youandM;restricted to accessing reports produced from theandM;files? If so, your ability to customize - or to createandM;new reports - is severely limited.andM;*  What security demands will be placed on the reportsandM;you generate? Will the executive need a password orandM;other identification?andM;*  Who will be evaluating your system? Will theirandM;criteria for success match yours? Will it match theandM;user's (for whom the system was designed)?andM;An early decision win have to be  make or buy.&quot; Even if you intend to  make,'you may want to investigate what is available from the vendors, just to getsome ideas on what can be done.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
