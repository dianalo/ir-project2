While Wright declined to take a stand Friday on the politicallyrisky pay plan, he said lawmakers would ban speaking fees andcertain other outside income for themselves if the proposal wereenacted.   The large pay raise was recommended by a presidential commissionand endorsed Thursday by President Reagan, who will formally sendthe proposal to Congress with his budget plan on Monday.   ``We must ensure that the door to service remains open toAmericans who must work to support their families, educate theirchildren and save for their retirement,'' the president wroteCongress in a letter explaining his position. Reagan also proposedan end to the often-criticized outside income system for members ofCongress.   The raise will become law automatically unless each house ofCongress rejects it by Feb. 8 _ 30 days after Reagan's budgetsubmission.   ``I think that the speaker (House Speaker Jim Wright) iscommitted to making sure there is no vote,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke,R-Iowa, who has proposed legislation requiring Congress to vote onany pay raise, while delaying enactment until the next Congress.   Wright said Friday, ``I will neither encourage nor prevent avote. Regular procedure will be followed.''   Regular procedure normally means legislation would go to acommittee, be the subject of hearings, and return to the House floorafter committee approval. Such a process normally takes far longerthan 30 days.   Referring to outside income for lawmakers, called honoraria,Wright said, ``If the pay raise takes effect, there will be a ban onspeaking fees and certain other forms of outside income-earninglimitations are being drafted in bipartisan consultations.''   In the Senate, Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, haspromised a vote.   Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H., called the pay raisepreposterous and said he had asked Senate leaders to schedule anearly vote on a resolution of disapproval.   Reagan chose not to modify the presidential commission'srecommendation that members of Congress and federal district judges,who now make $89,500 a year, be paid $135,000.   The speaker's annual salary would go from $115,000 to $175,000,and that of majority and minority leaders from $99,500 to $155,000.   Top executive-branch officials such as Cabinet members would getraises from their current $99,500 a year to $155,000.   Reagan's proposal would raise a president's annual pay to about$350,000 from the current $200,000, where it has stood since 1969.However, such a hike would not take effect until 1993 because of aconstitutional prohibition on raising a president's pay during histerm.   President-elect Bush said Friday he supported Reagan's decision,but may take another look at the issue when he becomes president.Bush takes office Jan. 20.   Asked by reporters if the nation could afford the big payincrease at a time when it is grappling with huge budget deficits,Bush said: ``Well, I don't know whether we can afford anything thanto get this deficit under control.''   David Keating, executive vice president of the National TaxpayersUnion, said Reagan has a personal stake in his recommendationbecause his pension would rise by 56 percent if the pay raise isapproved. The pension is tied to Cabinet salaries.   The pension increase from $99,500 to $155,000 annually also wouldapply to former Presidents Ford, Carter and Nixon.   Keating said Reagan and the three former presidents should refusethe increase.   A White House press spokesman, B.J. Cooper, said the taxpayerunion figures were accurate, but had no comment on the call forReagan to refuse the increase.   ``The president was not aware of that when he approved the payraise,'' Cooper said. ``I don't know whether it would have changedhis decision, the other factors being so overwhelming.''</TEXT></DOC>
