 Gen.andP;  Peter Kind during an interview earlier this year,CHS will be the one system supporting the broad array of critical battlefieldfunctions now being integrated under the Army Tactical Command and ControlSystem (ATCCS) program.andP;  Kind is the Army's program executive officer (PEO)for command and control systems.andM;The umbrella ATCCS program embraces five battlefield functional areas ofapplications software performing maneuver control, fire support, air defense,intelligence/electronic warfare and combat service support.andM;Field commanders will rely on CHS for a breadth of purposes.andP;  Various CHSconfigurations will be used to command units in battle, automatically detectthe capability of enemy aircraft, generate reports for and by intelligenceofficers, produce battle plans and provide updated summaries of availablesupplies, Kind said.andM;The system also is being targeted for use by the Army's PEO for strategicinformation systems, Feliciano Giordano.andP;  During a recent interview, Giordanosaid the Army's portion of the Worldwide Military Command and Control Systemand a Europe-based C2 system are among those currently being developed forCHS compatibility.andM;In its &quot;spare time&quot; the CHS system can be configured to run Standard ArmyManagement Information Systems (STAMIS) like the medical system shipped toPanama in December, Kind said.andM;The Army has a long way to go before its systems are fully integrated,according to Gen.andP;  Emmett Paige, the retired commander of the InformationSystems Command.andP;  Paige said in a speech last year that the Army uses morethan 50 tactical computer systems.andM;Full integration under ATCCS will result in about &quot;30,000 [CHS] automationdevices for the tactical field Army if we fill out all our units,&quot; said BobGiordano, Kind's deputy.andP;  The Giordanos are not related.andP;  For applicationssuch as air defense, CHS will be the first form of automation ever used bycommanders.andM;In other cases, CHS replaces hardware that Kind said is &quot;older or slower ordoesn't have user assist or speed-type enhancements to get you from onefunction to the next.&quot;andM;The addition of a mouse and windows for the latest version of the maneuvercontrol system shows the Army hopes to make its system compatible with theincreasingly computer-literate base of users in the field, Kind said.andM;The General Accounting Office has pointed to the fact that there has beenonly one real-life use of a CHS device as evidence of snags in work on thefive major ATCCS functions.andP;  One former Army official said those snags boileddown to &quot;tedious software development cycles and budget problems.&quot;andM;Congress limited CHS hardware spending to $24 million last year because ofATCCS software delays.andP;  Among other factors, budget cuts during the late1980s slowed air defense and maneuver control systems development, GAO hasreported.andM;Kind conceded that ATCCS would be nearer completion had the Army settled onits hardware platform in advance of developing the major applicationssoftware, most of which is in the Ada programming language.andM;&quot;I guess you can look back and say we would have been better off if we werecommon earlier on in the process,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;But that's not the way ithappened.&quot;andM;In addition to the procurement of common hardware, he said ATCCS not acrucial shot in the arm when management of all its components was integratedunder the PEO system in early 1988.andM;Among potential delays in the ATCCS fielding schedule that loom ahead is anew concern about how susceptible the battle-field system might be toenemy-induced computer viruses.andM;Anti-virus measures could add several years to development cycles, oneindustry official said.andM;The Bush administration earlier this year requested $250 million for ATCCS inthe 1991 budget.andP;  Last year, ATCCS got $200 million.andM;Although the requirement on which it is based pre-dates the dramatic changesin Eastern Europe by years, Kind and other Army officials have argued that itis precisely in theaters such as the Panama invasion that superior C2 systemshave their most meaningful impact.andM;&quot;A capability that allows you to gather your information, process it, get itinto a useful form and disseminate your orders and instructions to the rightpeople in a synchronized manner, that sort of thing becomes even moreimportant on the battlefields we're likely to be going to,&quot; he said.andM;In their recent comments, a number of senior Defense officials have noted ablur in the line between traditional tactical computing, which tended to beconfigured within secure militarized systems, and conventional informationprocessing, which is performed by commercial off-the-shelf devices.andM;The fact that the first operational use of the CHS platform was for running aprototype STAMIS medical information system shows it is &quot;a smart thing forthe Army to use the CHS wherever possible, to use one standard system in thefield,&quot; Kind said.andM;Eventually, officials have said, all STAMIS applications will be converted ordeveloped for CHS.andP;  As well, Kind said some commercially obtainableapplications have been built into the CHS and five major C2 systems.andM;&quot;We are trying to take advantage of the progress in the automation industryto leverage technology rather than call for development of special processeswhich have a shorter lifetime,&quot; Bob Giordano said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
