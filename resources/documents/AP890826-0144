Cohan Have Things in Common</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Malcolm Forbes might measure up to George M.Cohan as a showman, but the multimillionaire motorcyclist doesn'thold a candle to the vaudevillian hoofer when it comes to outdancingthe Internal Revenue Service.   Forbes dropped some vague hints that he might seek a taxdeduction for his belly-dancing ``party of the century'' lastweekend in Morocco, where such swells as Henry Kissinger andElizabeth Taylor ate pigeon under tents.   After a small public outcry, Forbes called a news conference tosay he would not be taking a deduction for his 70th birthday partyand in fact had never considered doing so.   Clearly business entertainment is not what it was 59 years ago,when the late George M. Cohan scored a victory over the IRS sosweeping that tax lawyers still talk about ``the Cohan rule.''   Cohan, the original Yankee Doodle Boy, claimed $55,000 indeductions for entertaining his actors, employees, drama critics andlawyer in the early 1920s. The IRS disallowed the deductions becausehe hadn't kept records.   In 1930, a federal appeals court ruled that since Cohan obviouslyhad some legitimate expenses, the IRS appeals board should find away to grant him some deductions in spite of the lack of records.   The Cohan rule hamstrung the IRS over the following decades, and``people who knew how to milk the system probably got more than theyshould have,'' said Nancy Anderson, senior tax research and trainingspecialist for Handamp;R Block Inc. in Kansas City, Mo.   In the 1980s, Congress has tightened the tax laws on businessentertainment considerably, not only toughening record-keepingstandards to eliminate the Cohan rule but cutting the deduction rateto 80 percent and gradually limiting or disallowing deductions thatonce were routine: golf club dues, nights out at cheesy discos, skyboxes at the Superdome.   Malcolm Forbes argued this past week that he could have qualifiedfor some deductions if he had wanted to, since many of his guestswere advertisers in his magazine, but several tax experts said themagazine publisher was living in the past.   ``I don't know where Forbes was coming from,'' said Mario Borino,national tax director for the accounting firm of BDO Seidman. ``Evenunder the old law, before tax reform, I would have serious questionsas to whether the cost of any part of that birthday was deductible.''   ``It used to be kind of fair game, you go to a sporting event oryou go out to a nightclub-type restaurant and have a great time, andjust because you happen to do business with the people, you deductit. That just doesn't fly anymore,'' said Handamp;R Block's Ms. Anderson.   Forbes is not the only victim of changing times: A Philadelphiarabbi, Arnold H. Feldman, was turned down by the Tax Court in 1986when he tried to deduct the $4,000 cost of his son's bar mitzvahreception for 725 people.   Under Section 274 of the tax code, the taxpayer must establishthat ``the item was directly related to or ... associated with theactive conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business.''   For Forbes, discussing hot-air balloons with Lee Iacocca thuswould not qualify. Moreover, there is no deduction for ``amountswhich are lavish or extravagant under the circumstances,'' whichwould seem to disqualify a party featuring 600 belly dancers and athundering horde of 200 Berber marksmen on horseback.   ``It's a very good example of what used to be, and would be areal hard sell now,'' Ms. Anderson said.   In other business and economic news this past week:   _The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks set a record onThursday, one day short of the second anniversary of its previouspeak. The 56.53-point surge to 2,734.64 was hailed by some analystsas closing the book on the stock market crash of 1987. But onFriday, stocks retreated slightly and the Dow average fell 2.28points.   _Holiday Corp., once known as ``America's Innkeeper,'' agreed tosell its Holiday Inn division to Britain's brewing giant Bass PLC,which will pay $125 million in stock and assume about $2.1 billionof Holiday debt. The deal marked the end of an era for the nation'sfirst motel franchise, founded 35 years ago by entrepreneur KemmonsWilson.   _Texas Air Corp.
