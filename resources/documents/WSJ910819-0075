Rumors of the acquisition agreement had apparentlysurfaced in the stock market, because On-Line's stock rose $1to $10.75 on Thursday in New York Stock Exchange compositetrading, after holding steady right below $10 for a month.Trading was about five times the normal volume for the stock.On-Line stock rose another $1 on Friday before the agreementwas announced. Afterward, the stock shot up a further $3 toclose at $14.75, within striking distance of the$15.75-a-share purchase price.</LP><TEXT>   Sanjay Kumar, a senior vice president at ComputerAssociates, Garden City, N.Y., said he wasn't aware of anyunusual trading activity. On-Line executives couldn't bereached for comment.   The acquisition would be a good fit. OnLine, Fort Lee,N.J., sells software that helps data-processing managers testand debug the huge programs that run on their mainframes.Similarly, one of Computer Associates' main product lines isso-called utility software, which helps companies run theirmainframe data centers more efficiently.   &quot;There's very little overlap,&quot; Mr. Kumar said. &quot;They fitvery well into our strategy.&quot;   On-Line had been a lackluster company in recent years,posting an operating loss for fiscal 1989 ended May 31 and anearnings decline for the fiscal 1991 first quarter. Its stockhad been as low as $4 as recently as November. But earningspicked up as fiscal 1991 progressed, and On-Line posted a 37%increase in earnings for the year to $4.6 million, or 79cents a share. Revenue rose 13% to $101.3 million. Thebiggest splash the company had made in recent years was in1989 when its founder, Jack M. Berdy, then 42 years old,surrendered day-to-day control of the company to attendmedical school.   The situation at Computer Associates also appears to havestabilized. Often criticized for acquiring companies andexpanding too fast, Computer Associates finally ran intoproblems with the acquisition of Cullinet Software Inc. twoyears ago, and earnings sank. But Computer Associates manageda tiny increase in earnings in fiscal 1991 ended March 31, to$159.3 million, or 86 cents a share, on a 4% rise in revenueto $1.35 billion.   &quot;The biggest swing factor remains the economy,&quot; Mr. Kumarsaid. &quot;When that turns around, we and a lot of other peoplewill do a lot better.&quot;   Computer Associates stock fell 12.5 cents, to $9, in NewYork Stock Exchange trading Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
