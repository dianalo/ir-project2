This paper presents an actual case study in which the impactof power system disturbances on the University of Alberta's computersystem are analysed in some detail. An overview of the existing outagereporting systems (e.g., utility's and customer's) is presented to revealthe effectiveness of the existing reliability data bases. Based on thesedata bases a Markov model of the computer system's performance is presentedto define the operational states of the computer system.</TEXT></DOC>
