Klein</HL><DD> 03/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> NEW ORLEANS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   It is NCAA basketball Final Four time again, and the nation is atingle with anticipation over this newest sports classic. The tournament it climaxes has uniquely captured the public fancy in recent years. Unlike professional games, which are big-city based, the college-hoops showdown is truly national in scope, and the fervor of the contestants stands in welcome contrast to the workaday air that surrounds too many of our entertainments.    My journalistic participation in this season's tourney is not without uneasiness, however. I keep coming across evidence that my colleagues and I are doing no favors to the young men who play these games by lavishing attention on them.    I have long suspected this to be the case, and have shied away from writing intensively about athletes who have not reached their majority. Sure, I write about college and, occasionally, even high-school sports, but I try to focus on the coaches and the schools rather than on the kids. I claim no special merit for this, by the way; I realize that writing 1,000 or so words twice a week for a business publication allows me to pick and choose from the almost infinite number of subjects the field provides. If I were a sports editor with six or eight daily pages to fill, and a clamorous readership to satisfy, I might well do otherwise.    One recent story, however, should give all sportswriters and editors pause. It's the cover piece in the March 16 issue of Sports Illustrated, in which Gary McLain, a star of the Villanova team that won the 1985 NCAA basketball crown, confesses to having been a cocaine addict while he played.    I was neither shocked nor surprised at McLain's revelation. One reads far too much about cocaine addiction these days for either reaction. What caught my eye were a couple of lines in which McLain explains why he felt he was above the kind of constraints that might have led him to think twice about using the illegal and harmful drug.    &quot;All my life, being an athlete made me different, and now {at Villanova} we were being treated like kings,&quot; he wrote. And again: &quot;{I would} go into a bar after a game and have people buy me drinks and line up to talk to me. It's unrealistic worship . . . but how was I to know different? I was taught to play basketball and assumed that these were some of the fringe benefits, my just rewards.&quot;    Who gave him those ideas? The adults he grew up around, his coaches and teachers, and a news corps that gave his activities equal play with events of greater import.    McLain's story made a particular impression on me because it jibed with similar or related points made by a couple of people I'd interviewed recently. Tom House, the pitching coach of the baseball Texas Rangers, just completed a Ph.D. thesis on the difficulties of many former professional athletes in adjusting to their lives after sports. He traces this to their &quot;terminal adolescence,&quot; which, he thinks, stems partly from the adulation heaped on them as youths.    &quot;Kids who excel in sports have everything done for them and handed to them,&quot; House said. &quot;A lot of them never have to learn the responsibilities of being a child, son or student. It's no wonder they have trouble being a husband, father or employee.&quot;    Skip Dillard, a three-year starter on the crack DePaul University basketball teams of the early 1980s, tied the distractions of media attention to his failure to earn a degree from the Chicago school. &quot;There'd be reporters at every practice, interviewing us,&quot; he said. &quot;My head'd be buzzing all day wondering how I'd look on TV or how my quotes'd come out in the papers. It was tough to pay attention to the books with that going on.&quot;    The glorification of the young athlete is, of course, nothing new. Moreover, one school of thought holds that participation in the give-and-take of the news interview can be a valuable part of a young athlete's education. Coaches such as John Thompson of Georgetown, who limit news-media access to their players, regularly are taken to task for unneccessarily &quot;sheltering&quot; their charges.    But Thompson is protecting his players against a much heavier barrage of sports-news coverage than used to be aimed at athletes in the past. About 1,000 media credentials have been issued to this weekend's Final Four, against 250 10 years ago. There's very probably a qualitative difference, too. It's one thing to get a write-up in your home-town paper, and another to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated or a star of a prime-time, coast-to-coast TV extravaganza.    Further, I submit that while the process of media contact might be beneficial to a young man or woman, the result sometimes isn't, even in the short run. Sports Illustrated, which functions (uncomfortably, I hope) as both the conscience of college sports and one of its main publicity engines, put Brian Bosworth, the ferocious and vociferous Oklahoma linebacker, on the cover of its 1986 football-preview issue. &quot;The Boz&quot; also fronted a late-season SI -- for flunking a test for steroid drugs he took believing perhaps that they would sustain his &quot;superman&quot; persona.    This winter, SI reached even further down the age scale for a piece on the nation's single &quot;best&quot; basketball players in each high school and junior-high grade. How would you like to be a 12- or 13-year-old boy taking the court with that label? How would you like to be the boy's parent?    It's time for news people to give fresh thought to their treatment of young athletes. It should be possible to cover their games without warping their tender psyches. If no other reasons prevail, self-interest may suffice: We are helping to create the thorny characters we must deal with when they turn pro. </TEXT></DOC>
