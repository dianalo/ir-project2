But many of them probably won't be happy about it.</LP><TEXT>   President Bush announced that the Treasury is changing thetax-withholding tables to reduce overpayments: Many peoplewho typically get refunds will get smaller ones, startingnext year, while others will owe money. Meanwhile, paycheckswill increase about $25 billion over the next 12 months, arise designed to give a welcome jolt to the economy in theelection year. The increase will be as much as $172 a job forsingle workers and $345 a job for married workers.   The change will affect single people making $53,200 orless a year in wages subject to withholding, and marriedcouples making $90,200 or less. People who don't want theirwithholding reduced can fill out a new W-4 form, which theygive to their employers.   The withholding provision, which originated in theTreasury and was dubbed Project X, was a closely guardedsecret until it was announced in the president's State of theUnion address. Although it was reflected in the budgetnumbers, it was never explained or referred to in the text.   &quot;In theory, this is an absolutely beneficial thing,&quot;asserted David Berenson, national director of tax policy atErnst andamp; Whinney. &quot;For the vast majority of people, it isbetter to have the money than to make an interest-free loanto government.&quot;   Tax professionals and economists, however, questionwhether the plan will work well in practice. &quot;The Americantaxpayer doesn't want to have to run to a finance company orbank on April 15 to get a high-interest loan to pay histaxes,&quot; said Robert Resichauer, director of the CongressionalBudget Office. &quot;Given that situation, they've chosen toover-withhold. There's a rationality to this behavior.&quot;   To ease taxpayer anxiety, the Internal Revenue Servicesaid it would waive penalties for any underpayment of taxesfor 1992 that is caused by the change in the withholdingtables, although taxpayers would still owe interest. Inaddition, the agency will review all returns for 1991 andnotify those taxpayers who are likely to owe money next yearas a result of the change, suggesting that they adjust theirwithholding for 1992.   Administration officials said that even after thewithholding change, the average refund will total around$700, down from about $1,000 currently. About 88% of thepeople in the affected income categories that currently getrefunds will continue to do so.   Still, because the changes will go into effectautomatically and the increase in individual paychecks willbe small, many taxpayers may not realize they will oweadditional taxes or get smaller refunds until they fill outtheir tax returns next year. &quot;You can't imagine the shrieksof horror you will get when people realize they have to paymore money,&quot; said Sheldon Cohen, a former tax commissioner.&quot;People want to be over-withheld.&quot;   Moreover, the prospect of tackling the calculations neededto determine whether the withholding changes would bebeneficial may be intimidating to some taxpayers. &quot;The W-4 isan incredibly complex document,&quot; said Peter Merrill, seniormanager at Price Waterhouse. &quot;It's complicated.&quot;   The IRS said employees seeking to opt out of the changeshould give their employers a new W-4 form claiming the samenumber of withholding allowances. But they should ask thatextra tax be withheld. Married couples should divide $345 bythe number of pay periods each year and ask for that amountto be withheld each payday. Single taxpayers should divide$172 by the number of their pay periods.   The Treasury is urging employers to put the revised tablesinto effect as soon as possible. New withholding tables weremailed Tuesday night to big employers. Small employers willget their revised tables by mid-February. Officials said theagency won't crack down on small businesses that aren't ableto begin using the tables by the March 1 deadline.</TEXT></DOC>
