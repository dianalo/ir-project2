Following completion of the downhole system, final preparationswere made for a reservoir-energy-extraction test. This Initial Closed-loopFlow Test was planned to obtain operating characteristics for planninga much longer test for thorough reservoir evaluation. The 30-day ICFTsucceeded with final production of about 10 MWt at 192{sup 0}C, whileinjecting 285 gpm at 4600 psi and producing 206 gpm at 500 psi. The waterloss rate and flow impedance were high, 27% and 18 psi/gpm respectively,but were declining. Radioactive tracer tests indicated reservoir volumegrowth during the experiment which was continuously monitored for acousticor microseismic activity. Following circulation shut-in conditions weremonitored for about one month - venting still produces fluid at eitherwellhead. Attempted repair operations in the production well EE-2 metserious problems of collapsed conductor and casing at 3200 m, 335 m abovethe reservoir zone. Optional EE-2 operations, in preparation for theLong Term Flow Test, are being considered.</TEXT></DOC>
