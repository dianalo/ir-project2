After rising fromless than $1 billion in 1980 to a peak of more than $60billion in 1988, buy-out volume has fallen dramatically, toless than $4 billion in 1990. Among the casualties of thiscrash are certain theories that were put forward torationalize the enormous surge in dealmaking in the late1980s.   One often heard view during the boom was that buy-outactivity was driven by a need to restructure inefficientcorporations and discipline wayward managers. According tothis view, the staggering debt-service burdens associatedwith leveraged buy-outs are beneficial, because they forcemanagers to cut costs and trim wasteful capital expenditures.Although there is significant merit to this theory, it failsto explain the sharp decline in buy-out activity since 1988.Surely the available supply of inefficient corporations andwayward managers did not dry up overnight?</LP><TEXT>   Another explanation of the leveraged buy-out boom has alsobeen damaged by the bust: the view that the buy-outs of thelate 1980s were largely a tax-driven phenomenon. There is nodoubt that tax considerations have played an important -- andin some particular cases a dominant -- role in buy-outactivity. But tax factors alone cannot explain theriches-to-rags evolution of the buy-out market.   How, then, does one make sense of what has transpired?According to a wide range of observers, from financiers tojournalists, the story is a relatively straightforward one,albeit one that does not fit comfortably with economists'traditional notions of efficient markets. Simply put, thebuy-out market overheated. The success of early dealsattracted a large inflow of unsophisticated money. By thelate 1980s too much financing was chasing too few good deals.The end result was that many transactions were overpriced,recklessly structured, or both.   Although this story may sound compelling, the evidencemarshalled to support it has usually been anecdotal. In aneffort to arrive at a more systematic analysis, Steven Kaplanof the University of Chicago and I examined detailed data onthe pricing and financial structure of 124 large managementbuy-outs undertaken between 1980 and 1989.   The first fact that jumped out from our sample was that itwould indeed have been smart to have invested in the buy-outsof the early 1980s but to have avoided many of the buy-outsof the late 1980s. Of 41 deals done between 1980 and 1984, wehave found only one instance of a company defaulting on itsdebt payments -- a default rate of just over 2%. In starkcontrast, 19 of 78 deals put together between 1985 and 1988have defaulted -- a rate of over 24%. And this surelyunderstates the proportion of the later deals that willeventually run into problems, since many of them are just afew years old.   Of course, hindsight is always 20/20, and it could be thatthe negative outcomes in the later deals are at least partlythe product of after-the-fact bad luck (unexpected adversechanges in product market conditions, interest rates, etc.)rather than just poor deal pricing and structuring. In orderto address this possibility, our study focused for the mostpart on information available at the time the buy-outs wereput together. We asked: Was there anything systematicallydifferent about the buy-outs of the late 1980s that shouldhave given reasonable investors cause for concern? The answeris yes.   In particular, Mr. Kaplan and I identified three &quot;problemareas&quot; that worsened in the late 1980s: buy-out pricing,capital structure design, and the incentives of managementand other interested parties.                                                                                                          Buy-out Pricing: This is perhaps the most obvious place tolook for signs of trouble. Clearly, the higher the buy-outprice relative to company fundamentals, the lower the returninvestors can expect to receive. And indeed, the ratio ofbuy-out price to company cashflow followed a broad upwardtrend in the latter part of the 1980s. Not only did buy-outvaluations move with the general level of the stock market,reaching a peak just before the stock market crash of 1987,but buy-out premiums -- the amount by which deal pricesexceeded the pre-transaction stock price of the company --also rose steadily and sharply over the late 1980s. Thesepremiums nearly doubled in three years: to 48.1% in 1988 from25.7% in 1985. Lofty premiums tend to confirm the thesis thattoo much money was chasing too few good deals.   Where was the additional money coming from? Before 1985,the junk bond market played virtually no role in our samplebuy-outs-subordinated debt financing typically came fromprivate placements. After that, however, the junk bond marketbecame extremely prominent, contributing financing for morethan 50% of the transactions. Thus there is a closecorrespondence between the use of junk debt and the trendtoward higher buy-out premiums. Even within a given yearthere was a tendency for buy-outs that made use of the junkbond market to have higher price-to-cashflow ratios thanthose that didn't.                                                                                                          Capital Structure Design: At first glance, many aspects ofbuy-out capital structure appear to have remained relativelyunchanged over the 1980s. Debt as a proportion ofenterprises' total capital hovered steadily in the 87% to 90%range. Thanks to the advent of deferred interest securitiessuch as payment-in-kind and zero coupon bonds, the ability ofcompanies to cover interest obligations out of operatingcashflows also remained fairly constant, even as buy-outprices rose.   However, subtler changes were taking place. As pricesrose, senior bank lenders moved to protect themselves bytrying to extract their money from deals more quickly.Beginning in 1986 the principal paydown schedules on banks'loans to buy-outs accelerated. While this may well have madesense from the narrow perspective of the banks, it came atthe expense of both subordinated lenders and the companiesthemselves, which now faced greatly increased debt-serviceburdens. The ratio of gross operating cashflow to total debtobligations (interest plus principal) was cut almost in half-- from a median of about 1.2 in the period 1980-1984, toapproximately 0.7 in the period 1986-88. In the absence oflarge asset sales at favorable prices, many of the laterbuy-out companies had no hope of servicing their total debtobligations.   Unfortunately, to the extent that the deals of the late1980s do get into trouble, these changes in capital structuredesign also imply that they may have a more difficult timerestructuring their way out. The widespread use of diffuselyheld public bonds should make renegotiation with subordinatedlenders much more difficult.   This is exacerbated by the virtual disappearance ofso-called &quot;strip financing&quot; in the buy-outs of the late1980s. In earlier deals, subordinated lenders were oftengiven an equity kicker. In addition to enhancing theirreturns this kicker could play a positive role in situationsof financial distress, by helping to align the interests ofdebt and equity investors. Such equity strips were present inmore than 70% of pre-1984 buy-outs, but in fewer than 25% ofpost-1985 buy-outs.   Finally, the fact that senior bank lenders in later dealsare scheduled to have their loans largely repaid beforesubordinated junk bond investors see any cash at all islikely to reduce the banks' incentives to contribute freshcapital to a workout situation -- the banks may already seethemselves as quite well protected, and thus may be unwillingto subsidize subordinated lenders by putting in new money.   Incentives: Our evidence also shows that, over the courseof the 1980s, management and other interested partiesincreasingly took money out of buy-out transactions rightaway, rather than retain a stake in the success of thecompanies. Arguably, this increased the incentive to simplyget a deal done, rather than ensure that the deal was soundlypriced and structured.   For example, in the period 1980-84, managers typicallyleft 57 cents invested in the post-buy-out company for everydollar they had invested in the pre-buy-out company. In theperiod 1985-88, this figure dropped to 35 cents. In otherwords, managers began &quot;cashing out&quot; their ownership stakes toa significantly larger degree in later deals. In a paralleldevelopment, other interested parties (investment bankers,lawyers, buy-out promoters) saw their fee income skyrocket,to as high as 6.0% of deal value by 1988 from about 2.5% ofdeal value in the period 1980-84.   So what does all this mean for the future of leveragedbuy-outs? While there were certainly excesses in the late1980s, it is important to bear in mind that these excesseswere in part a response to the legitimate success of earliertransactions. Thus it would be incorrect to dismiss theentire leveraged buy-out phenomenon as a speculative &quot;bubble&quot;of some sort. Barring dramatic regulatory or tax changes,leveraged buy-out activity should continue at a moderatepace. What is most likely to change are the structuralattributes that made the deals of the late 1980s particularlyfragile.   For example, there will probably be much more emphasisplaced on designing debt contracts that facilitate workoutsif things go wrong. This may mean a permanent return to thetype of privately placed deals (with equity strips forlenders) that were the norm up through the early 1980s. Soalthough leveraged buy-outs are far from a thing of the past,those financed with large amounts of publicly issued junkbonds may well be.   ---   Mr. Stein teaches at MIT's Sloan School of Management, inCambridge, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
