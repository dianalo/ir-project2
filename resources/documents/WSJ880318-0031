A spokesman for Texas Air said that the $16-a-share offer for as many as 1.6 million shares of 20% participating non-cumulative convertible preferred stock &quot;no longer makes economic sense&quot; because Eastern's financial condition has deteriorated since last summer. The spokesman added that there aren't any plans to offer to buy the shares at a lesser price.    Texas Air's offering circular stated that the employee trusts which held the shares had fiduciary obligations to tender them. But Eastern's unions fought the tender offer in court, believing that by holding the shares they had rights as shareholders and could block Texas Air from transferring assets away from Eastern. A judge last August enjoined the trusts from tendering shares until the fiduciary obligations were resolved.    It wasn't immediately clear what would become of the lawsuits surrounding the tender offer that had been expanded to contest the transfer of Eastern's reservation system to a low-cost subsidiary of Texas Air.    A Texas Air attorney advised the court yesterday that portions of the lawsuit should be considered moot. Charles Bryan, who heads the union representing machinists at Eastern, said he wasn't sure whether the trusts would proceed with the lawsuit. &quot;But we certainly characterize this as good news,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
