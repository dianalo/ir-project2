Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (theStafford Act, or the Act), and to implement the Office of Management andBudget's (OMB) ``common rule,'' Uniform Administrative Requirements forGrants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments (effectiveon October 1, 1988). The ``common rule'' was recently adopted by FEMA at44 CFR Part 13. The President signed the Disaster Relief and EmergencyAssistance Amendments of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-707) on November 23, 1988. Thislaw amends the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93-288, and retitlesit the Stafford Act. As a result, FEMA is adding new Parts 206 and 207to 44 CFR. The interim regulations which are being published at this timewill govern disasters or emergencies declared by the President on or afterNovember 23, 1988. Existing regulations at 44 CFR Part 205 will remainin effect to govern those major disasters and emergencies declared priorto enactment of the amendments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>These interim rules will be effective on March 21, 1989,except paragraph (b)(2) of andSection; 206.253 which is effective May 22,1989.

However, public comments are welcome andwill be considered in adoption of the final rule. These interim rules will be published in three phases. The subparts appearinghere include individual assistance, public assistance, and certain unchangedprovisions of hazard mitigation requirements. Subparts A, B, and C of thispart, relating to general agency policy, the declaration process, and FEMA'snew emergency assistance authorities, will be published as interim rulesin a few weeks, along with Subpart N, covering the new hazard mitigationgrant program. New 44 CFR Part 207, covering the Great Lakes planning grant,will be published separately. A related document containing a proposedrule to modify 44 CFR Part 206,  Subpart M, relating to hazard mitigationplanning requirements, will also be published separately. Many sections of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 have been amended, butsome have not. In the supplementary information below, each section forwhich FEMA is today establishing interim rules (Subparts D, E, F, G, H,I, J, K, L, and M) will be discussed, whether changed or not, and a contactperson will be named to provide further information on each subject. Inall sections, including those which have not been changed, a new numberingsystem has been established, and conforming changes have been made. Whenpublished later, the document dealing with Subparts A, B, C, N, and Part207, will complete interim rules to implement the new legislation. TheStafford Act is also published in this document, for the reader's reference,in the appendix.General Information [Subpart A, Reserved] The Stafford Act makes several changes to the section on generally applicableinformation (e.g., definitions and policy). Since many parts of the newprogram are affected, FEMA will include a new subpart covering generalinformation in its later submission. This subpart is therefore reserved.The Declaration Process [Subpart B, Reserved] This subpart is also reserved for future publication. The Stafford Actmakes technical changes to the declaration process, and FEMA will includethem in the second phase of interim rulemaking. Emergency Assistance [Subpart C, Reserved] The Stafford Act authorizes emergency assistance only for essential workand services to save lives, to protect property and public health and safety,or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe, including debris removaland temporary housing. In addition, section 501(b) of the Stafford Actauthorizes the President to make an emergency declaration without a requestfrom a Governor when the primary responsibility for response to a particularsituation rests with the Federal Government. Interim regulations for emergencydeclarations will be issued in the second phase of publication. Temporary Housing Assistance (Subpart D) The Stafford Act made several major changes to the Temporary Housing Assistanceprogram, which have been incorporated in the regulations. They include:1. The definition of adequate alternate housing has been changed to includethe categories of the population identified in the new law. 2. The term ``minimal repairs'' which previously appeared in the DisasterRelief Act of 1974 has been changed to ``home repairs.'' However, the dollarlimitations established by the Associate Director, State and Local Programsand Support, for the purposes of authorizing such home repairs in lieuof other forms of housing assistance, have not been changed. They continueto be a minimum of $100 and a maximum of $5,000. 3. The paragraphs of the regulations which relate to the use of mobilehomes have been modified to include the 75 percent Federal/25 percent Statecost sharing on the construction of group sites, as required in section408 of the Act. Temporary housing expenses which are not cost-shared, i.e.,which are fully Federally funded, are also clarified. 4. The sections of the regulations on reconsiderations and terminationof assistance have been combined and titled ``Appeals.'' The only changesare to provide for a 60-day appeal period for applicants, as required bysection 423 of the Stafford Act, and two paragraphs in the regulationswhich govern the prior disaster law, 44 CFR 205.52 (m) and (p), have beencombined to form one appeal paragraph. FEMA's response time remains at15 days from receipt of the appeal. 5. The period of temporary housing assistance has been increased from upto 12 months to up to 18 months. 6. With respect to the Stafford Act's requirements that applicants be notifiedof the assistance which can be provided, the regulations now specify thateach applicant be provided with information regarding all forms of assistance,specific criteria which must be met to qualify for each form, the applicablelimitations, and how to request changes and file appeals. 7. The regulations now specify, in accordance with the law, that in providingtemporary housing, consideration will be given to the location of schools,employment, and the location of any crops or livestock the applicant musttend. 8. Throughout the regulations the word ``livability'' has been substitutedfor ``habitability.'' The meaning is the same in each case; the changewas made only to make the regulations more understandable. For further information on the temporary housing assistance program, contactF. Scott Martin at 202-646-3650. Individual and Family Grant Programs (Subpart E) The Stafford Act makes several changes to the IFG program, which have beenincorporated in the regulations.1. The maximum grant amount has been changed to $10,000. This amount willbe adjusted at the beginning of each fiscal year to reflect changes inthe Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Departmentof Labor. This change creates the need for a corresponding change in thedollar value of the required flood insurance policy for housing and personalproperty grants where the applicant resides in a flood zone. The requirementwill be for a policy to cover the grant amount. Currently, FEMA will require$7,000 building and $3,000 contents for a homeowner, and $10,000 contentsfor a renter. FEMA will continue to award a grant for the first year ofthe required 3-year policy. Public comments are welcome on whether FEMAshould continue to require flood insurance coverage on the entire maximumgrant amount. 2. The section on advance of the State's 25 percent share of the IFG programhas been eliminated from the IFG regulations. The Stafford Act provides,in section 319, that the President may lend or advance the non-Federalshare of any cost-shared assistance provided under the Act to an eligibleapplicant or State in certain defined circumstances. FEMA will publishthe regulations implementing this new feature in Subpart A, General Information,in the next two months. It is worth noting here that the loan will nowbear interest from the date of disbursement. In the past, interest wasnot assessed on IFG advances to States. 3. The Stafford Act changed the allowable administrative expenses from3 percent to 5 percent. FEMA will provide the State the option of receiving3 percent automatically, with no documentation requirement, or 5 percentif appropriate justification is submitted for the full amount. Public commentson this approach are welcome. 5. Changes to the duplication of benefits provisions (section 312 of theStafford Act) have been incorporated into the IFG regulations. The Statemay make grants in advance of receipt of other assistance if the applicanthas not received the other assistance to which they may be entitled bythe time of application for IFG assistance. For further information on IFG, contact Donna M. Dannels at 202-646-3660.Other Individual Assistance (Subpart F) Several other programs and provisions have been changed as a result ofthe Stafford Act. 1. Disaster unemployment assistance (DUA) has been substantially changed,as follows: _The maximum assistance period has been reduced from 52 to 26 weeks fromthe disaster declaration date, to reflect current unemployment insurancepractices. _The feature which formerly allowed regular unemployment insurance recipientsto get a DUA supplement for the same week to bring them up to the DUA maximumweekly benefit amount has been eliminated. _Persons entitled to unemployment insurance benefits are not entitled toany DUA until their insurance benefits have expired, and then they mayreceive DUA only for the remainder of the 26-weeks-from-declaration timeperiod. _FEMA will no longer fund the ``waiting week.'' The Secretary of Labor has the delegated authority to implement the DUAprogram and to publish rules in accordance with general policy guidancefrom FEMA. FEMA has provided the above policy guidance to the Department,and the Secretary has agreed to publish amendments to 20 CFR Part 625 toeffectuate the new Act. To replace a similar section published in old 44CFR 205, a brief text is published at 206.141 for convenience of the reader.For further information, contact Karen Keefer at 202-646-3658. 2. The Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training program has been changedin the following respects: _Although the Stafford Act eliminates the explicit requirement that grantsunder this section should be made through the National Institute of MentalHealth (NIMH), FEMA is making no changes with respect to NIMH involvementin the administration of this program. _A 60-day period for the State to appeal FEMA's decision for both the ``immediateservices'' and ``regular program'' portions of the crisis counseling programhas been established, in accordance with the Stafford Act. To make theseparate appeals processes distinct, FEMA is establishing an immediateservices application submission period of 14 days after the declarationdate. _Documented eligible expenses are now reimbursable from the incident date,rather than the declaration date, as specified in section 424 of the StaffordAct. These expenses will be allowed under the immediate services portionof the program. In accordance with the grant criteria of the NIMH, underwhich the regular program funding is provided, expenses are allowable onlyfrom the date of the regular program grant award. To obtain reimbursementfrom the incident date, the State may apply for an immediate services grant._The regulations have been reorganized for the reader's convenience, toseparate the ``immediate services'' and ``regular program'' provisionsand to allow clearer explanations of the changes to each portion of thecrisis counseling program. For further information contact Donna M. Dannels at 202-646-3662. 3. Section 312 of the Stafford Act makes important changes to duplicationof benefits policies. The regulations now state that FEMA will ensure uniformityin procedures established to prevent assistance duplication. They alsoprovide that assistance given to individuals and families under the Act,and comparable assistance provided by States, local governments, and disasterassistance organizations (such as the American Red Cross), will not beconsidered as income for the recipients in any eligibility determinationsmade for Federally funded income assistance or resource-tested benefitprograms (such as welfare or food stamp programs). Each of the assistanceprogram regulations which are affected by section 312 have adopted languagecomplying with this general provision; specifically, that Federal assistancemay be provided by an agency prior to when it would normally be providedif the person has not received the other benefits to which he/she is entitledby time of application of the Federal assistance. For more information contact Sharon A. Hordesky at 202-646-2778 or theprogram officer for the particular program. No changes have been made to the regulations dealing with food commoditiesand disaster legal services. Public Assistance Project Administration (Subpart G) The Stafford Act and the ``common rule,'' adopted by FEMA at 44 CFR Part13, require a number of changes in the administration of public assistancegrants. The most significant changes result from requirements of the ``commonrule'' and are discussed first. 1. In accordance with the ``common rule,'' FEMA has determined that Statesshould be given as much flexibility and authority as possible in the managementof the public assistance program. For many years FEMA has considered allfunds approved for public assistance to be a grant to the State. Fundsgoing to individual applicants have been considered subgrants. However,the method used by FEMA to process public assistance funds has not trulyrecognized the State as the grantee in that separate applications and supplementshave been processed for subgrantees by FEMA. The issuance of 44 CFR Part13 has required that changes be made in the method used to process publicassistance grants. Although Part 13 was published in March 1988, FEMA didnot publish proposed regulations covering the changes it required due tothe fact that new legislation which would impact on FEMA's administrationof the public assistance program was pending in Congress. Since FEMA believedthat there would be new legislation, it would have been premature to publisha proposed ``project administration'' regulation before the legislationwas enacted. By the time FEMA learned that Congress had passed the legislationand that the President had signed it, the effective date of Part 13 hadalready passed. Therefore, since Part 13 was effective on October 1, 1988,FEMA feels obligated to publish the changes that regulation required onan interim basis. Part 13 establishes uniform administrative rules for Federal grants, oneof which is that the grantee (the State) is the organization which is requiredto sign the grant application (Standard Form 424, Application for FederalAssistance) and administer all subgrants. In the past, FEMA has used amodified SF 424 as an application from eligible subgrantees. The granteedid not sign the individual grant applications and was not responsiblefor administering subgrants. Thus, a change is required in FEMA's proceduresfor processing public assistance grants to comply with Part 13. The changerequired is not extensive as far as procedures for the initial processingof grants is concerned, but significant changes are required in the areaof State administration of public assistance grants. The changes are discussedbelow:_FEMA will continue to prepare, review, and process Damage Survey Reports(DSR's) in the same manner that they have been in the past, up to the timethat DSR's are combined into a grant or supplement. At that time FEMA willcombine all DSR's that are ready for approval and approve one basic grantor one supplement instead of separate grants or supplements for each subgrantee.The State will be the grantee, and DSR's covering all eligible work relatedto the disaster will be approved for the State. The State will approvesubgrants to individual ap- plicants using FEMA approved DSR's as the basisfor approval and will be responsible for overall management of the grantfunds. _The State will be responsible for managing the day-to-day operations ofthe grant and subgrant supported activities. This will include monitoringthe activities of subgrantees to assure compliance with FEMA requirementsand that performance goals are being met, as well as reporting to FEMAon performance and financial aspects on a quarterly basis. The State willbe required to develop procedures through which it will manage the programand which will form the basis for FEMA approval of funds to cover Statemanagement costs. _The State has been given new authority to approve extensions of time forpublic assistance projects. Since most time extension requests in the pasthave been justified and FEMA has ultimately approved them, sending themto FEMA for approval merely adds administrative cost. _The State will be required to review all claims (partial claims coveringmore than one subgrantee will be accepted), recommend to FEMA an amountfor approval, and certify that all funds have been expended in accordancewith the FEMA-State Agreement. _The State must ensure that all audits required by the Single Audit Actof 1984 are performed. The State will be required to review such auditscompleted for each subgrantee and, if adverse findings are reported inany audit, the State must ensure that appropriate action is taken and reportthat action to FEMA. The State will also be required to have a single auditperformed on State operations and submit a copy of such an audit to theFEMA Inspector General. 2. The Stafford Act authorizes Federal funding for projects costing lessthan $35,000 (adjusted annually in accordance with the Consumer Price Index)based on the Federal estimate of cost of such small projects. Therefore,the criteria for payment of claims has been changed. FEMA estimates thatmore than 90 percent of all public assistance projects will meet the criteriafor small projects and final payment may be made upon approval of the project,thereby getting funds to disaster affected communities much sooner. 3. Funding options under the Stafford Act are very similar to the optionsavailable previously. The ``Grant-in-lieu'' option remains the same buthas been renamed ``Improved Project.'' ``Flexible funding'' has also beenrenamed and is now called ``Alternate Project.'' Previously, when flexiblefunding was selected, all permanent restorative projects approved for anapplicant had to be included. Therefore, very few applicants took thatoption. The Stafford Act authorizes applicants to select the alternateproject option on a project by project basis, thereby giving the applicantmuch greater flexibility. There is still a 10 percent reduction in eligiblecosts when this option is selected, but it is only for those individualprojects which are selected, not for all permanent work. 4. A change in the appeals procedures has been made in accordance withthe Stafford Act. The grantee (the State) is given 60 days to submit anappeal of any FEMA decision. FEMA then has a maximum of 90 days in whichto make a decision on that appeal. Since a proper determination cannotbe made without all related information, the regulations provide that the90 day period will start upon receipt of an appeal and all related information.Also, the regulations allow the FEMA Associate Director, upon agreementof the State, to refer appeals of a highly technical nature to an independentscientific or technical group for review. In such a case FEMA and the Statemust mutually agree to a longer decision period and to share the cost ofreview by the independent group with FEMA. This approach will provide FEMAand the State with the advantage of an independent review without FEMAgiving up its ultimate responsibility to make final determinations relativeto the public assistance program. For further information contact John Lundberg at 202-646-3688. Public Assistance Eligibility (Subpart H) The enactment of the Stafford Act brought about a number of changes toeligibility requirements for assistance to State and local governmentsand eligible private nonprofit organizations. In addition, the implementationof the new ``common rule'' for grant administration changed eligibilityrequirements as well. Changes to individual provisions are discussed in the following paragraphsin generally the same sequence as they appear in the existing 44 CFR Part205 Subpart E regulations. 1. The term ``immediate threat,'' which is used to define the extent ofemergency protective measures, now has a specific definition although theterm was previously used without definition. Previously, emergency protectivemeasures to protect against an event which could be expected to occur notless than every 5 years were eligible. Something which might happen in5 years cannot really be considered to be in the ``immediate'' future orof an emergency nature. Therefore, ``immediate threat'' is redefined asa threat from an event which can be reasonably expected to occur within1 year. In practical application there is very little difference betweena protective facility to guard against 1-year storm and one to guard againsta 5-year storm.2. The definition of ``predisaster condition'' is deleted because its useis covered by the requirement that eligible work must be disaster related.The previous usage of the term was redundant and is no longer used in theregulation. 3. The definition of ``educational facilities'' under ``private nonprofitfacility'' is changed so that the only exclusion is for facilities usedprimarily for religious purposes or instruction. 4. Private nonprofit irrigation districts would be eligible the same asother private nonprofit utilities. Support facilities for private nonprofitemergency organizations would also be eligible. 5. A sixth category of private nonprofit facility has been added in theStafford Act. The new category is defined as ``other private nonprofitfacilities which provide essential services of a governmental nature tothe general public.'' This will include facilities such as: community centers,libraries, homeless shelters, senior citizen centers, shelter workshopsand similar facilities which are open to the general public. This new categoryof private nonprofit facility will include most facilities which previouslyqualified under the criteria for ``public entities.'' Other public entitieswill continue to be eligible for assistance when their applications aresubmitted by an eligible applicant. Many facilities serving a rural communityor unincorporated town or village may also qualify for assistance underthis new category. 6. The definition of those standards which may be included in eligiblework now includes the upgrading of a facility when required by a Stateor Federal agency regulation. 7. The criteria to be used when considering assistance which may be availablefrom another Federal agency is changed. Previously, if an agency had theauthority to perform an item of work or grant assistance but did not havefunds available at the time, FEMA would step in to grant the assistance.FEMA would grant assistance regardless of the reason the funds were unavailable.The new policy is that when an agency has the specific authority to restorefacilities or grant assistance, FEMA will <T3>not</T3> grant assistance regardless of the availability of funds.FEMA believes it should not override the decisions made by the Congressor the Administration not to fund another agency's program from money appropriatedto the President's Disaster Fund. 8. Previous regulations covering facilities leased to or from an eligibleapplicant provided that repairs were eligible for assistance if they werethe responsibility of the applicant under the lease (andSection; 205.73(c)).This policy is not being changed. However, this section was redundant inview of the general requirement that eligible work must be the responsibilityof the applicant. Therefore, the section has been deleted from the revisedregulation. 9. The paragraph discussing assurances (andSection; 205.73(d)), has beendeleted because the assurances referred to are primarily procedural innature and are dealt with in Subpart G, Project Administration, which isbeing published concurrently with this subpart. 10. Under the law, two types of applicants, public entities and rural orunincorporated communities, are required to apply through a State or politicalsubdivision of a State. Under new procedures in Subpart G, Public AssistanceProject Administration, the State will be making a single application toFEMA on behalf of all subgrantees. Therefore, the requirement in the lawis met and the separate requirement in the regulations is removed. 11. The eligibility criteria for facilities serving an unincorporated ruralcommunity are changed slightly. The facility must be open for the use ofthe general public. For example, a road system or any other facility ownedand maintained by a private nonprofit neighborhood association which couldbe open to the public would not be eligible if its use was restricted toresidents in that neighborhood. On the other hand, facilities such as awater or sewer system which must be connected to a residence and thereforecannot be open to the public, would not be ineligible because of this restriction.12. The discussion of grants-in-lieu, which is a funding mechanism, andtime limitations, which is a grant administration matter, are moved toSubpart G. A ``grant-in-lieu'' is now referred to as an ``improved project''in that subpart. 13. Work which is of the same type as maintenance is no longer discussedseparately, as had been the case in 44 CFR 205.73(h). The determinationof what was ``of disaster scope and magnitude'' was difficult to make andoften resulted in delays in approving eligible work. The use of the thresholdof a $250 dollar minimum DSR will still screen out the truly insignificantdamages. 14. Debris removal is now covered as a separate section rather than a subheadingunder Emergency Work. The general emergency work section is removed becausedebris removal and emergency protective measures which are the two subdivisionsof emergency work have slightly different eligibility criteria. These criteriafor debris removal and emergency protective measures are discussed in theirrespective subsections. Debris removal which is necessary to eliminatea threat to lives, public  health or safety, or of significant damage toimproved property, is eligible. In addition, if disaster related debrisis widespread on public or private property, and its removal is necessaryto ensure the economic recovery of the community as a whole, it may beeligible. 15. The removal of debris from drainage facilities is no longer coveredseparately in this subsection. Under the general criteria for restorationof facilities, debris in drainage channels, reservoirs or debris basinswill be eligible if the facility is actively used and maintained. 16. When emergency protective measures are being performed to eliminateor lessen an immediate threat of additional damage, such work is limitedto that necessary to protect against an immediate threat. The change inthe definition of ``immediate threat'' is discussed earlier. Such workmust also be cost effective when public or private property is to be protected.17. In the permanent restoration of facilities, much of the specific guidanceof previous regulations has been eliminated in favor of more general requirements.The individual categories of facility are no longer discussed separately.The general guidance applies equally to all types of facilities almostwithout exception. The few exceptions are noted in the regulation._The first change is in the area of standards. If an applicant is willingto adopt a standard, either of its own development or based upon a nationalstandard, FEMA will apply that standard to the restoration of the damagedfacility. The cost of that standard is an eligible cost. This practiceis basically the same as the old procedure of having the Associate Directorprescribe a standard to be adopted by the applicant. The new procedure,however, places emphasis on the applicant's initiative in keeping withExecutive Order 12612 on Federalism. _In the restoration of bridges, FEMA will no longer require constructionto FEMA's bridge width standards. Reconstruction will be to the standardwhich the applicant was using at the time of the disaster or one adoptedprior to FEMA's approval of assistance. In the absence of a standard, reconstructionwill be to predisaster condition. _The discussion of specific hazard mitigation measures is replaced withthe general statement that the costs of mitigation measures required byFEMA are an eligible cost. Measures required after review of floodplainmanagement, environmental, or Coastal Barrier Resources Act requirementsare examples of these. The new legislation specifies that these costs areeligible. FEMA will review projects for mitigation opportunities and mayrequire that cost effective mitigation measures be incorporated into therestoration of the facility. 18. In the area of cost eligibility, most of the discussion of specifictypes of costs is now covered in 44 CFR Part 13 (the ``common rule'') andthe associated OMB Circular A-87, Revised. Therefore, those items are removedfrom this subpart. Significant changes in eligible costs as a result ofthe new legislation are the inclusion of fringe benefits for an applicant'sown employees, and allowances for administrative expenses for individualapplicants and for the State to manage the public assistance program inaccordance with the ``common rule.'' In the Stafford Act, at section 406(f),there is an administrative allowance to be calculated as a percentage ofcertain assistance. However, the base to which the percentage is appliedis different for subgrantees and grantees. In section 406(f)(1)(A) through(D) the percentage for subgrantees is applied to the net eligible costs.Net eligible costs are defined in section 406(e) as the total cost of restoration.In section 406(f)(2)(A) through (D), the percentage for grantees is appliedto ``such total amount,'' referring back to ``total amount of assistanceprovided'' in 406(f)(2). The term ``assistance provided'' means the Federalshare provided to the grantee or subgrantee. Secondly, in these same twosubparagraphs, 406(f)(1) and (2), the designation of what is covered bythese indirect cost allowances is different for subgrantees and for thegrantee. For subgrantees, the administrative allowance covers all costsof requesting, obtaining, and administering the grant. For the grantee,the administrative allowance covers only extraordinary costs of certainactivities. Therefore, there is an additional eligible direct cost itemto cover costs for the State to manage the program. For further information contact Charles Stuart at 202-646-3691. Public Assistance Insurance Requirements (Subpart I) The new Subpart I, Public Assistance Insurance Requirements, reflects animportant limitation of Federal assistance described in the Stafford Act.It also condenses what were two subparts_General Insurance Requirementsand Flood Insurance Requirements_into one subpart. Other changes have beenmade to achieve consistency with the ``common rule,'' to more accuratelyinterpret existing statutory language, and to clarify regulatory intent.1. The regulations now provide a strong incentive for government and privatenonprofit entities to purchase flood insurance for their insurable facilities.In accordance with section 406(d) of the Stafford Act, all buildings andtheir contents in an identified flood plain will be treated as if theywere fully covered by the standard flood insurance policy available throughthe NFIP. As such, the Federal estimate of eligible damages will be reducedby the maximum amount of the insurance proceeds which would have been receivedhad the building and contents been fully covered. This provision becomeseffective on May 22, 1989. In the meantime, FEMA will highlight its importancein a separate <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, provide written notice to each communityparticipating in the National Flood Insurance Program, contact governmentassociations, and take other reasonable measures to disseminate this information.It should be noted that, in accordance with section 406(d)(3) of the Act,private nonprofit facilities in special flood hazard areas which are notcovered by flood insurance solely because of the local government's failureto participate in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) are exemptedfrom this reduction. However, even though this exemption is reflected inandSection; 206.253(b)(2), it is misleading. This is because the Flood DisasterProtection Act of 1973 prohibits Federal assistance in special flood hazardareas of nonparticipating communities. Therefore, where local governmentshave opted not to participate in the NFIP, private nonprofit organizationscan not acquire NFIP-issued flood insurance for their flood prone facilities.Consequently, they will be unable to certify that they will obtain andmaintain flood insurance for their flood-damaged facilities. An inabilityto make such a certification precludes such private nonprofit organizationsfrom receiving assistance under the Stafford Act. However, the host communityhas the option of qualifying for and joining the NFIP within 6 months ofthe disaster declaration. The operator of the private nonprofit facilitycould then purchase the required flood insurance and become eligible forassistance. 2. Consistent with revised OMB policy, as expressed on the SF 424, Applicationfor Federal Assistance, insurance will not be required for grants associatedwith DSR estimates of less than $10,000. This minimum does not in any wayaffect the reduction of Federal assistance described above. 3. Section 311 (b) of the Stafford Act, which is unchanged from section314 of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, stipulates that no further assistancemay be provided for a facility for which the insurance required as a conditionof previous Federal disaster assistance was not purchased or properly maintained.We had previously interpreted this stipulation as allowing for reducedassistance; that is, assistance could be provided, but had to be reducedby the amount of insurance which should have been carried by the facility.On review of this section, we found that, contrary to our past interpretation,there is no basis for providing even reduced assistance where the insurancehas not been purchased or properly maintained. Section 206.253(a) incorporatesthis finding. Because this is a provision of the Disaster Relief Act of1974 (before the current amendments) which was carried forward unchangedin the Stafford Act, FEMA believes it is necessary to make the change effectiveimmediately. Therefore, this change is being published in this interimrule. For further information contact Alex Burns at 202-646-3670. Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Subpart J) This subpart required only conforming changes as a result of the StaffordAct or implementation of the ``common rule.'' Its sections have been renumbered.For more information contact Charles Stuart at 202-646-3691. Community Disaster Loans (Subpart K) This subpart was recently revised under 44 CFR Part 205, Subpart F. Itwas issued as a proposed rule on April 28, 1987 (52 FR 15348) and as afinal rule on April 18, 1988 (53 FR 12681). For this publication, thissubpart required only conforming changes as a result of the Stafford Actor the ``common rule.'' Its sections have been renumbered. For more informationcontact Eugene Morath at 202-646-3683.Fire Suppression Assistance (Subpart L) This subpart required conforming changes as a result of the Stafford Act.The paragraphs were renumbered in accordance with the new numbering systemfor Part 206. Section 206.394, Cost Eligibility, was revised to deletecost principles covered in the ``common rule.'' However, program specificcost eligibility items considered necessary for developing fire suppressionassistance grants were retained. Section 206.395, Grant Administration,was revised to delete uniform grant administration procedures in the ``commonrule.'' However, since Subpart L is activated without a major disasterdeclaration, the grant administration section was retained to incorporateother CFR subparts which normally are effective upon a major disaster declaration.For further information contact Eugene Morath at 202-646-3683. Hazard Mitigation Planning (Subpart M) This subpart required no substantive changes as a result of the StaffordAct or the ``common rule.'' However, to distinguish this subpart from thenew hazard mitigation grant program, as provided in section 404 of theStafford Act, the name has been changed from ``Hazard Mitigation'' (asit appears in Subpart M of 44 CFR Part 205) to the above name. It has alsobeen renumbered, and conforming changes have been made. A proposal to amendthis subpart will be made soon, to be based on refinements and experienceover the past few years.

Hazard Mitigation Grant Program [Subpart N, Reserved] <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Considerations </ITAG>The majority of the provisions of the interim rule have either been assessedby prior environmental assessments or represent actions which are categoricalexclusions pursuant to FEMA's regulation at 44 CFR Part 10, EnvironmentalConsiderations. An environmental assessment covering the remaining itemsled to the determination that there will be no significant impact causedby implementation of this interim rule and that the preparation of an EnvironmentalImpact Statement is not required. Environmental assessments are on fileand may be inspected or obtained at the Office of Disaster Assistance Programsfor each program area, or at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Officeof General Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street,SW., Washington, DC 20472. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility </ITAG>FEMA has determined that this rule is not a major rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291, and will not have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.Hence, no regulatory impact analyses have been prepared. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Assessment </ITAG>In promulgating this rule, FEMA has considered the President's ExecutiveOrder on Federalism issued on October 26, 1987 (E.O.12612, 52 FR 41685).The purpose of the Executive Order is to assure the appropriate divisionof governmental responsibilities between national government and the States.Among other provisions, this rule implements the requirement in 44 CFRPart 13, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and CooperativeAgreements to State and Local Governments, that agency administrative provisionsin regulations be consistent with Part 13. There are significant changesin grant administration procedures which have Federalism impacts and therefore,a Federalism Assessment has been prepared. Interested parties may inspector obtain copies of this assessment at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk,Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reporting Requirements </ITAG>The Office of Management and Budget has approved the information collectionrequirements contained in this rule under the provisions of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et. seq., </T3>and has assigned the following OMB Control Numbers:<ITAG tagnum="16">_For the IFG program: 3067-0146 and 3067-0163 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_For the crisis counseling program: 3067-0166 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_For the temporary housing assistance program: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">3067-0009 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">3067-0043 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">3067-0124 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_For the public assistance program: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">3067-0026 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">3067-0033 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">3067-0034 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">3067-0048 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">3067-0066 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">0348-0006 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 44 CFR Part 206 </ITAG>Disaster Assistance: general, the declaration process, emergency assistance,individual assistance, public assistance, the Coastal Barrier ResourcesAct, community disaster loans, fire suppression, hazard mitigation, andGreat Lakes planning assistance.

(b) <T3>Program intent. </T3>Assistance under this program is made availableto applicants who require temporary housing as a result of a major disasteror emergency that is declared by the President. Eligibility for assistanceis based on need created by disaster-related unlivability of a primaryresidence or other disaster-related displacement, combined with a lackof adequate insurance coverage. Eligible applicants may be paid for authorizedaccommodations and/or repairs. In the interest of assisting the greatestnumber of people in the shortest possible time, applicants who are ableto do so will be encouraged to make their own arrangements for temporaryhousing. Although numerous instances of minor damage may cause some inconvenienceto the applicant, the determining eligibility factor must be the livabilityof the primary residence. FEMA has also determined that it is reasonableto expect applicants or their landlords to make some repairs of a minornature. Temporary housing will normally consist of a check to cover housing-relatedcosts wherever possible. (c) <T3>Definitions. </T3>(1) ``Adequate alternate housing'' means housing that: (i) Accommodates the needs of the occupants. (ii) Is within reasonable commuting distance of work, school, or agriculturalactivities which provide over 25% of the household income. (iii) Is within the financial ability of the occupant in the realizationof a permanent housing plan. (2) ``Effective date of assistance'' means the date the eligible applicantreceived temporary housing assistance but, where applicable, only afterappropriate insurance benefits are exhausted. (3) ``Essential living area'' means that area of the residence essentialto normal living, i.e., kitchen, one bathroom, dining area, living room,entrances and exits, and essential sleeping areas. It does not includefamily rooms, guest rooms, garages, or other nonessential areas, unlesshazards exist in these areas which impact the safety of the essential livingarea. (4) ``Fair market rent'' means a reasonable amount to pay in the localarea for the size and type of accommodations which meets the applicant'sneeds. (5) ``Financial ability'' is the determination of the occupant's abilityto pay housing costs. The determination is based upon the amount paid forhousing before the disaster, provided the household income has not changedsubsequent to or as a result of the disaster or 25 percent of gross postdisaster income if the household income changed as a result of the disaster.When computing financial ability, extreme or unusual financial circumstancesmay be considered by the Regional Director. (6) ``Household'' means all residents of the predisaster residence whorequest temporary housing assistance, plus any additions during the temporaryhousing period, such as infants, spouses, or part-time residents who werenot present at the time of the disaster but who are expected to returnduring the temporary housing period. (7) ``Housing costs'' means shelter rent and mortgage payments includingprincipal, interest, real estate taxes, real property insurance, and utilitycosts, where appropriate. (8) ``Occupant'' means an eligible applicant residing in temporary housingprovided under this section. (9) ``Owner-occupied'' means that the residence is occupied by: the legalowner; a person who does not hold formal title to the residence and paysno rent but is responsible for the payment of taxes, or maintenance ofthe residence; or a person who has lifetime occupancy rights with formaltitle vested in another. (10) ``primary residence'' means the dwelling where the applicant normallylives during the major portion of the calendar year, a dwelling which isrequired because of proximity to employment, or to agricultural activitiesas referenced in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. (d) <T3>Duplication of benefits</T3>_(1) <T3>Requirement to avoid duplication. </T3>Temporary housing assistanceshall not be provided to an applicant if such assistance has been providedby any other source. If any State or local government or voluntary agencyhas provided temporary housing, the assistance under this section beginsat the expiration of such assistance, and may continue for a period notto exceed l8 months from the date of declaration, provided the criteriafor continued assistance in paragraph (k)(3) of this section are met. Ifit is determined that temporary housing assistance will be provided underthis section, notification shall be given those agencies which have thepotential for duplicating such assistance. In the instance of insured applicants,temporary housing assistance shall be provided only when: (i) Payment of the applicable benefits has been significantly delayed;(ii) Applicable benefits have been exhausted; (iii) Applicable benefits are insufficient to cover the temporary housingneed; or (iv) Housing is not available on the private market. (2) <T3>Recovery of funds. </T3>Prior to provision of assistance, the applicantmust agree to repay to FEMA from insurance proceeds or recoveries fromany other source an amount equivalent to the value of the temporary housingassistance provided. In no event shall the amount repaid to FEMA exceedthe amount recovered by the applicant. All claims shall be collected inaccordance with agency procedures for debt collection.(e) <T3>Applications_</T3>(1) <T3>Application period. </T3>Applications for temporary housing assistanceshall be accepted for a 60-day period following the date of a declarationof a major disaster or emergency, unless additional time for submissionof applications is authorized by the Regional Director in order to achieveuniformity of application periods in contiguous States. After the establishedperiod, applications shall be accepted; however, processing shall not becompleted unless authorized by the Regional Director on a case-by-casebasis. (2) <T3>Household composition. </T3>Members of a household shall be includedon a single application and be provided one temporary housing residenceunless it is determined by the Regional Director that the size of the householdrequires that more than one residence be provided. (f) <T3>General eligibility guidelines. </T3>Temporary housing assistance maybe made available to those applicants who, as a result of a major disasteror emergency declared by the President, are qualified for such assistance.(1) <T3>Conditions of eligibility. </T3>Temporary housing assistance may beprovided only when <T3>both </T3>of the following conditions are met: (i) The applicant's primary residence has been made unlivable or the applicanthas been displaced as the result of a major disaster or emergency because:(A) The residence has been destroyed, essential utility service has beeninterrupted, or the essential living area has been damaged as a resultof the disaster to such an extent as to constitute a serious health orsafety hazard which did not exist prior to the disaster. The Regional Directorshall prepare additional guidelines when necessary to respond to a particulardisaster; (B) The residence has been made inaccessible as a result of the incidentto the extent that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to gainentry due to the disruption or destruction of transportation routes, otherimpediments to access, or restrictions placed on movement by a responsibleofficial due to continued health and safety problems; (C) The owner of the applicant's residence requires the residence to meettheir personal needs because the owner's predisaster residence was madeunlivable as a result of the disaster; (D) Financial hardship resulting from the disaster has led to evictionor dispossession; or (E) Other circumstances resulting from the disaster, as determined by theRegional Director, prevent the applicant from occupying their predisasterprimary residence. (ii) Insured applicants have made every reasonable effort to secure insurancebenefits, and the insured has agreed to repay FEMA from whatever insuranceproceeds are later received, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.(2) <T3>Conditions of ineligibility. </T3>Except as provided for in section408(b), Temporary Housing Assistance shall not be provided: (i) To an applicant who is displaced from other than their primary residence;or (ii) When the residence in question is livable, i.e., only minor damageexists and it can reasonably be expected to be repaired by the applicant/owneror the landlord; or (iii) When the applicant owns a secondary or vacation residence, or unoccupiedrental property which meets their temporary housing needs; or (iv) To an applicant who has adequate rent-free housing accommodations;or (v) To an applicant who has adequate insurance coverage and there is noindication that benefits will be delayed; or (vi) When a late application is not approved for processing by the RegionalDirector; or (vii) To an applicant who evacuated the residence in response to officialwarnings solely as a precautionary measure, and who is able to return tothe residence immediately after the incident (i.e., the applicant is nototherwise eligible for temporary housing assistance). (g) <T3>Forms of Temporary Housing Assistance. </T3>(1) Temporary Housing Assistanceis normally provided in the form of a check to cover the cost of rent oressential home repairs. The exceptions to this are when existing rentalresources are not available and repairs to the home will not make it livablein a reasonable period of time, or when the eligible applicant is unableto physically leave the home due to the need to tend crops or livestock.(i) Government-owned, private, and commercial properties. When an eligibleapplicant is unable to obtain an available temporary housing unit, FEMAmay enter into a leasing agreement for the eligible applicant. Rent paymentsshall be in accordance with the fair market rent (FMR) rates establishedfor each operation for the type and size residence. (ii) Transient accommodations. Immediately following a Presidentially declaredmajor disaster or emergency, disaster victims are expected to stay withfamily or friends without FEMA assistance, or to make use of mass sheltersto the fullest extent possible for short-term housing. Transient accommodationsmay be provided when individual circumstances warrant such assistance foronly a short period of time or pending provision of other temporary housingresources. Transient accommodations may be provided for up to 30 days unlessthis period is extended by the Regional Director. Authorized expendituresfor transient accommodations shall be restricted to the rental cost includingutilities except for those which are separately metered. Payment for food,telephone, or other similar services is not authorized under this section.(2) Mobile homes, travel trailers, and other manufactured housing units.Government-owned or privately owned mobile homes, travel trailers, andother manufactured housing units may be placed on commercial, private,or group sites. The placement must comply with applicable State and localcodes and ordinances as well as FEMA'S regulations at 44 CFR Part 9, FloodplainManagement and Protection of Wetlands, and the regulations at 44 CFR Part10, Environmental Considerations. (i) A commercial site is a site customarily leased for a fee because itis fully equipped to accommodate a housing unit. In accordance with section408(a)(2)(B), the Associate Director has determined that leasing commercialsites at Federal expense is in the public interest. When the Regional Directordetermines that upgrading of commercial sites or installation of utilitieson such sites will provide more cost-effective, timely, and suitable temporaryhousing than other types of resources, they may authorize such action atFederal expense. (ii) A private site is a site provided or obtained by the applicant atno cost to the Federal Government. Also in accordance with section 408(a)(2)(B),the Associate Director has determined that the cost of installation orrepairs of essential utilities on private sites is authorized at Federalexpense when such actions will provide more cost-effective, timely, andsuitable temporary housing than other types of resources. (iii) A group site is a site which accommodates two or more units. In accordancewith section 408(a)(2)(A), locations for group sites shall be providedby State or local government complete with utilities. However, the AssociateDirector may authorize development of group sites, including installationof essential utilities, by the Federal Government, based on a recommendationfrom the Regional Director; provided, however, that the Federal expenseis limited to 75 percent of the cost of construction and development (includinginstallation of utilities). In accordance with section 408(a)(4) of theStafford Act, the State or local government shall pay any cost which isnot paid for from the Federal share, including long-term site maintenancesuch as snow removal, street repairs and other services of a governmentalnature. (3) Temporary mortgage and rental payments. Assistance in the form of mortgageor rental payments may be paid to or be provided on behalf of eligibleapplicants who, as a result of a major disaster or emergency, have receivedwritten notice of dispossession or eviction from their primary residenceby foreclosure of any mortgage or lien, cancellation of any contract ofsale, or termination of any lease entered into prior to the disaster. Writtennotice, for the purpose of this paragraph, means a communication in writingby a landlord, mortgage holder, or other party authorized under State lawto file such notice. The purpose of such notice is to notify a person ofimpending termination of a lease, foreclosure of a mortgage or lien, orcancellation of any contract of sale, which would result in the person'sdispossession or eviction. Applications for this type of assistance maybe filed for up to 6 months following the date of declaration. This assistancemay be provided for a period not to exceed 18 months or for the durationof the period of financial hardship, as determined by the Regional Director,whichever is less. The location of the residence of an applicant for assistanceunder this section shall not be a consideration of eligibility. (4) Home repairs. Repairs may be authorized to quickly repair or restoreto a livable condition that portion of or areas affecting the essentialliving area of, or private access to, an owner-occupied primary residencewhich was damaged as a result of the disaster. Installation of utilitiesor conveniences not available in the residence prior to the disaster shallnot be provided. However, repairs which are authorized shall conform toapplicable local and/or State building codes; upgrading of existing damagedutilities may be authorized when required by these codes. (i) <T3>Options for repairs. </T3>Eligible applicants approved for repairsmay be assisted through one or a combination of the following methods:(A) Cash payment. Payment shall be limited to the reasonable costs forthe repairs and replacements in the locality, as determined by the RegionalDirector. This will be the method normally used, unless unusual circumstanceswarrant the methods listed under paragraph (g)(4) (i)(B) or (C) of thissection. (B) Provision of materials and replacement items. (C) Government awarded repair contracts when authorized by the AssociateDirector. (ii) <T3>Feasibility. </T3>Repairs may be provided to those eligible applicants:(A) Who are owner-occupants of the residence to be made livable; (B) Whose residence can be made livable by repairs to the essential livingarea within 30 days following the feasibility determination. The RegionalDirector may extend this period for extenuating circumstances by determiningthat this type of assistance is still more cost effective, timely and otherwisesuitable than other forms for temporary housing; and (C) Whose residence can be made livable by repairs to the essential livingarea, the cost of which do not exceed the dollar limitations establishedby the Associate Director. The Regional Director may, on a case-by-casebasis, waive the dollar limitations when repairs are more cost effectiveand appropriate than other forms of housing assistance or when extenuatingcircumstances warrant. (iii) <T3>Scope of work. </T3>The type of repair or replacement authorized mayvary depending upon the nature of the disaster. Items will be repairedwhere feasible or replaced only when necessary to insure the safety orhealth of the occupant. Replacement items shall be of average quality,size, and capacity taking into consideration the needs of the occupant.Repairs shall be disaster related and shall be limited to: (A) Repairs to the plumbing system, including repairs to or replacementof fixtures, providing service to the kitchen and one bathroom; (B) Repairs to the electrical system providing service to essential livingareas, including repairs to or replacement of essential fixtures; (C) Repairs to the heating unit, including repairs to duct work, vents,and integral fuel and electrical systems. If repair or replacement throughother forms of assistance cannot be accomplished before the start of theseason requiring heat, home repairs may be authorized by the Regional Directorwhen an inspection shows that the unit has been damaged beyond repair,or when the availability of necessary parts or components makes repairimpossible; (D) Repairs to or replacement of essential components of the fuel systemto provide for cooking; (E) Pumping and cleaning of the septic system, repairs to or replacementof the tank, drainfield, or repairs to sewer lines; (F) Flushing and/or purifying the water well, and repairs to or replacementof the pump, controls, tank, and pipes; (G) Repairs to or replacement of exterior doors, repair of windows and/orscreens needed for health purposes; (H) Repairs to the roof, when the damages affect the essential living area;(I) Repairs to interior floors, when severe buckling or deterioration createsa serious safety hazard;(J) Blocking, leveling, and anchoring of a mobile home; and reconnectingand/or resetting mobile home sewer, water, electrical and fuel lines, andtanks; (K) Emergency repairs to private access routes, limited to those repairsthat meet the minimum safety standards and using the most economical materialsavailable. Such repairs are provided on a one-time basis when no alternativeaccess facilities are immediately available and when the repairs are morecost effective, timely or otherwise suitable than other forms of temporaryhousing. (L) Repairs to the foundation piers, walls or footings when the damagesaffect the structural integrity of the essential living area; (M) Repairs to the stove and refrigerator, when feasible; and (N) Elimination of other health and safety hazards or performance of essentialrepairs which are authorized by the Regional Director as not availablethrough emergency services provided by voluntary or community agencies,and cannot reasonably be expected to be completed on a timely basis bythe occupant without FEMA assistance. (iv) Requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act. FEMA has determinedthat flood insurance purchase requirements need not be imposed as a conditionof receiving assistance under paragraph (g)(4) of this section.

The Governoror his/her designee is responsible for the administration of the grantprogram. The provisions of this regulation are in accordance with 44 CFRPart 13, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and CooperativeAgreements to State and Local Governments. (b) <T3>Purpose. </T3>The grant program is intended to provide funds to individualsor families to permit them to meet those disaster-related necessary expensesor serious needs for which assistance from other means is either unavailableor inadequate. Meeting those expenses and needs as expeditiously as possiblewill require States to make an early commitment of personnel and resources.States may make grants in instances where the applicant has not receivedother benefits to which he/she may be entitled by the time of applicationto the IFG program, and if the applicant agrees to repay all duplicatedassistance to the State. The grant program is not intended to indemnifydisaster losses or to permit purchase of items or services which may generallybe characterized as nonessential, luxury, or decorative. Assistance underthis program is not to be counted as income or a resource in the determinationof eligibility for welfare or other income-tested programs supported bythe Federal Government, in that IFG assistance is intended to address onlydisaster-related needs. (c) <T3>Definitions used in this section. </T3>(1) ``Necessary expense'' meansthe cost of a serious need. (2) ``Serious need'' means the requirement for an item or service essentialto an individual or family to prevent, mitigate, or overcome a disaster-relatedhardship, injury, or adverse condition. (3) ``Family'' means a social unit living together and composed of: (i) Legally married individuals or those couples living together as ifthey were married and their dependents; or (ii) A single person and his/her dependents; or (iii) Persons who jointly own the residence and their dependents.

(5) ``Dependent'' means someone who is normally claimed as such on theFederal tax return of another, according to the Internal Revenue Code.It may also mean the minor children of a couple not living together wherethe children live in the affected residence with the parent who does notactually claim them on the tax return.(6) ``Expendable items'' means consumables, as follows: linens, clothes,and basic kitchenware (pots, pans, utensils, dinnerware, flatware, smallkitchen appliances). (7) ``Assistance from other means'' means assistance including monetaryor in-kind contributions, from other governmental programs, insurance,voluntary or charitable organizations, or from any sources other than thoseof the individual or family. It does not include expendable items. (8) ``Owner-occupied'' means that the residence is occupied by: The legalowner; a person who does not hold formal title to the residence but isresponsible for payment of taxes, maintenance of the residence, and paysno rent; or a person who has lifetime occupancy rights in the residencewith formal title vested in another. In States where documentation provingownership is not recorded or does not exist, the State is required to includein its administrative plan a State Attorney General approved set of conditionsdescribing adequate proof of ownership. (9) ``Flowage easement'' means an area where the landowner has given theright to overflow, flood, or submerge the land to the government or otherentity for a public purpose. (d) <T3>National eligibility criteria. </T3>In administering the IFG program,a State shall determine the eligibility of an individual or family in accordancewith the following criteria; (1) <T3>General. </T3>(i) To qualify for a grant under this section, an individualor family representative must: (A) Make application to all applicable available governmental disasterassistance programs for assistance to meet a necessary expense or seriousneed, and be determined not qualified for such assistance, or demonstratethat the assistance received does not satisfy the total necessary expenseor serious need; (B) Not have previously received or refused assistance from other meansfor the specific necessary expense or serious need, or portion thereof,for which application is made; and (C) Certify to refund to the State that part of the grant for which assistancefrom other means is received, or which is not spent as identified in thegrant award document. (ii) Individuals and families who incur a necessary expense or seriousneed in the major disaster area may be eligible for assistance under thissection without regard to their alienage, their residency in the majordisaster area, or their residency within the State in which the major disasterhas been declared except that for assistance in the ``housing'' category,ownership and residency in the declared disaster area are required (seeparagraph (d)(2)(i) of this section). (iii) The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, Pub. L. 93-234, as amended,imposes certain restriction on approval of Federal financial assistancefor acquisition and construction purposes. This paragraph states thoserequirements for the IFG program. (A) For the purpose of this paragraph, ``financial assistance for acquisitionor construction purposes'' means a grant to an individual or family torepair, replace, or rebuild the insurable portions of a home, and/or topurchase or repair insurable contents. For a discussion of what elementsof a home and contents are insurable, see 44 CFR Part 61, Insurance Coverageand Rates. (B) A State may not make a grant for acquisition or construction purposeswhere the structure to which the grant assistance relates is located ina designated special flood hazard area which has been identified by theDirector for at least 1 year as floodprone, unless the community in whichthe structure is located is participating in the National Flood InsuranceProgram (NFIP). However, if a community qualifies for and enters the NFIPduring the 6-month period following the major disaster declaration, theGovernor's Authorized Representative (GAR) may request a time extension(see paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section) from the Regional Director forthe purpose of accepting and processing grant applications in that community.The Regional Director or Associate Director, as appropriate, may approvethe State's request if those applicable governmental disaster assistanceprograms which were available during the original application period areavailable to the grant applicants during the extended application period.(C) (<T3>1</T3>) The State may not make a grant for acquisition or constructionpurposes in a designated special flood hazard area in which the sale offlood insurance is available under the NFIP unless the individual or familyagrees to purchase adequate flood insurance and to maintain such insurancefor 3 years, or as long as they live in the residence to which the grantassistance relates, whichever is less. Any previous grant recipient whomay have been required to maintain a policy for a longer period of time(under previous regulations) but who kept it for at least 3 years, is deemedto have satisfied this requirement. This provision need be applied onlyduring the 3-year period prior to a new disaster declaration. Adequateflood insurance, for IFG purposes, means a policy which will cover at leastthe amount of the grant award. If the grant recipient fails to obtain therequired flood insurance, he/she must return to the State the amount ofthe grant received for acquisition and construction on insurable real estateand personal property, and the flood insurance premium. If a grant recipientcancels a required policy within the 3-year period, he/she is ineligiblefor subsequent IFG assistance for the remainder of the 3-year period, upto the amount which should have been insured by flood insurance. The costof the first year's policy is a necessary expense for those required underthis section to buy flood insurance. (<T3>2</T3>) After a determination that flood insurance is required andafter disbursement of a grant, States shall require the grant recipientto provide proof of purchase of the required flood insurance. (D) A State may not make a grant for acquisition or construction purposeswhere an applicant who is required to apply to the SBA or Farmers HomeAdministration in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this sectionis denied loan assistance because of failure to have obtained and/or maintaineda flood insurance policy required as a condition of previous loan assistance.(E) A State may not make a grant for acquisition or construction purposeswhen the applicant is deemed to have assumed the risk knowingly, that is,when property is located within a flowage easement, or in an area betweena river and a levee (where the family built the home after the levee wasbuilt, or was compensated for future flood damage at the time the leveewas built), or when a residence is located on land leased to an individualwhere that lease holds the government harmless from the risk of damages.This restriction does not apply if an applicant is going to use the fundsto move out of the risk area. (iv) In order to comply with the President's Executive Orders on FloodplainManagement (E.O. 11988) and Protection of Wetlands (E.O. 11990), the Statemust implement the IFG program in accordance with FEMA regulations 44 CFRPart 9. That part specifies which IFG program actions require a floodplainmanagement decisionmaking process before a grant may be made, and alsospecifies the steps to follow in the decisionmaking process. Should theState determine that an individual or family is otherwise eligible forgrant assistance, the State shall accomplish the necessary steps in accordancewith that section, and request the Regional Director to make a final floodplainmanagement determination. (2) <T3>Eligible categories. </T3>Assistance under this section shall be madeavailable to meet necessary expenses or serious needs by providing essentialitems or services in the following categories: (i) Housing. With respect to primary residences (including mobile homes)which are owner-occupied at the time of the disaster, grants may be authorizedto: (A) Repair, replace, or rebuild; (B) Provide access.

Brown of Kansas City,Missouri, who left a portion of her estate to the United States for helpingvictims of natural disasters and other disasters not caused by or attributableto war. FEMA intends to use the funds, and any others that may be bequeathedunder this authority, in the manner and under the conditions describedbelow. (b) <T3>Purposes for awarding funds. </T3>Money from the Cora Brown Fund mayonly be used to provided for disaster-related needs that have not beenor will not be met by governmental agencies or any other organizationswhich have programs to address such needs; however, the fund is not intendedto replace or supersede these programs. For example, if assistance is availablefrom another source, including the Individual and Family Grant programand government-sponsored disaster loan assistance, then money from theCora Brown Fund will not be available to the applicant for the same purpose.Listed below are the general categories of assistance which can be providedby the Cora Brown Fund: (1) Disaster-related home repair and rebuilding assistance to familiesfor permanent housing purposes, including site acquisition and development,relocation of residences out of hazardous areas, assistance with costsassociated with temporary housing or permanent rehousing (e.g., utilitydeposits, access, transportation, connection of utilities, etc.); (2) Disaster-related unmet needs of families who are unable to obtain adequateassistance under the Act or from other sources. Such assistance may includebut is not limited to: health and safety measures; evacuation costs; assistancedelineated in the Act or other Federal, State, local, or volunteer programs;hazard mitigation or floodplain management purposes; and assistance toself-employed persons (with no employees) to reestablish their businesses;and (3) Other services which alleviate human suffering and promote the wellbeing of disaster victims. For example, services to the elderly, to children,or to handicapped persons, such as transportation, recreational programs,provision of special ramps, or hospital or home visiting services. Thefunds may be provided to individual disaster victims, or to benefit a groupof disaster victims. (c) <T3>Conditions for use of the Cora Brown Fund. </T3>(1) The Cora BrownFund is available only when the President declares that a major disasteror emergency exists under the Act, only in areas designated as eligiblefor Federal disaster assistance through notice in the Federal Register,and only at the discretion of the Assistant Associate Director, Officeof Disaster Assistance Programs, FEMA. The fund is limited to the initialendowment plus accrued interest, and this assistance program will ceasewhen the fund is used up. (2) A disaster victim normally will receive no more than $2,000 from thisfund in any one declared disaster unless the Assistant Associate Directordetermines that a larger amount is in the best interest of the disastervictim and the Federal Government. Funds to provide service which benefita group may be awarded in an amount determined by the Assistant AssociateDirector, based on the Regional Director's recommendation. (3) The fund may not be used in a way that is inconsistent with other federallymandated disaster assistance or insurance programs, or to modify othergenerally applicable requirements. (4) Funds awarded to a disaster victim may be provided by FEMA jointlyto the disaster victim and to a State or local agency, or volunteer organization,to enable such an agent to assist in providing the approved assistanceto an applicant. Example: Repair funds may be provided jointly to an applicantand the Mennonite Disaster Service, who will coordinate the purchase ofsupplies and provide the labor. (5) Money from this fund will not duplicate assistance for which a personis eligible from other sources.(6) In order to comply with the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub.L. 93-234), as amended, any award for acquisition or construction purposesshall carry a requirement that any adequate flood insurance policy be purchasedand maintained. The Assistant Associate Director shall determine what isadequate based on the purpose of the award. (7) The fund shall be administered in an equitable and impartial mannerwithout discrimination on the grounds of race, color, religion, nationalorigin, sex, age, or economic status. (8) Funds awarded to a disaster victim from this fund may be combined withfunds from other sources. (d) <T3>Administrative procedures. </T3>(1) The Assistant Associate Director,Office of Disaster Assistance Programs, shall be responsible for awardingfunds and authorizing disbursement. (2) The Comptroller of FEMA shall be responsible for fund accountabilityand, in coordination with the Assistant Associate Director, for liaisonwith the Department of the Treasury concerning the investment of excessmoney in the fund pursuant to the provisions contained in section 601 ofthe Act. (3) Each FEMA Regional Director may submit requests to the Assistant AssociateDirector on a disaster victim's behalf by providing documentation describingthe needs of the disaster victim, a verification of the disaster victim'sclaim, a record of other assistance which has been or will be availablefor the same purpose, and his/her recommendation as to the items and theamount. The Assistant Associate Director shall review the facts and makea determination. If the award amount is below $2,000, the Assistant AssociateDirector may appoint a designee to have approval authority; approval authorityof $2,000 or above shall be retained by the Assistant Associate Director.The Assistant Associate Director shall notify the Comptroller of a decisionfor approval, and the Comptroller shall order a check to be sent to thedisaster victim (or jointly to the disaster victim and an assistance organization),through the Regional Director. The Assistant Associate Director shall alsonotify the Regional Director of the decision, whether for approval or disapproval.The Regional Director shall notify the disaster victim in writing, identifyany award as assistance from the Cora Brown Fund, and advise the recipientof appeal procedures. (4) If the award is to be for a service to a group of disaster victims,the Regional Director shall submit his/her recommendation and supportingdocumentation to the Assistant Associate Director (or his/her designeeif the award is below $2,000), who shall review the information and makea determination. In cases of approval, the Assistant Associate Directorshall request the Comptroller to send a check to the intended recipientor provider, as appropriate. The Assistant Associate Director shall notifythe Regional Director of the decision. The Regional Director shall notifya representative of the group in writing. (5) The Comptroller shall process requests for checks, shall keep recordsof disbursements and balances in the account, and shall provide the AssistantAssociate Director with quarterly reports. (e) <T3>Audits. </T3>The Inspector General of FEMA shall audit the use of moneyin this account to determine whether the funds are being administered accordingto these regulations and whether the financial management of the accountis adequate.

A copy shall be provided to the Comptrollerfor the same purpose. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;andSection; 206.182 through 206.190</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.191</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Duplication of benefits. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Purpose. </T3>This section establishes the policies for implementingsection 312 of the Stafford Act, entitled Duplication of Benefits. Thissection relates to assistance for individuals and families. (b) <T3>Government policy. </T3>(1) Federal agencies providing disaster assistanceunder the Act or under their own authorities triggered by the Act, shallcooperate to prevent and rectify duplication of benefits, according tothe general policy guidance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.The agencies shall establish appropriate agency policies and proceduresto prevent duplication of benefits. (2) Major disaster and emergency assistance provided to individuals andfamilies under the Act, and comparable disaster assistance provided byStates, local governments, and disaster assistance organizations, is notconsidered as income or a resource when determining eligibility for orbenefit levels under federally funded income assistance or resource-testedprograms. Examples of federally funded income assistance or resource-testedprograms are the food stamp program and welfare assistance programs. (c) <T3>FEMA policy. </T3>It is FEMA policy: (1) To prevent duplication of benefits between its own programs and insurancebenefits, and between its own programs and other disaster assistance. Assistanceunder the Act may be provided in instances where the applicant has notreceived other benefits to which he/she may be entitled by the time ofapplication and if the applicant agrees to repay all duplicated assistanceto the agency providing the Federal assistance; (2) To examine a debt resulting from duplication to determine that thelikelihood of collecting the debt and the best interests of the FederalGovernment justify taking the necessary recovery actions to remedy duplicationwhich has occurred when other assistance has become available; (3) To assure uniformity in preventing duplication of benefits, by consultingwith other Federal agencies and by performing selected quality controlreviews, that the other disaster relief agencies establish and follow policiesand procedures to prevent and remedy duplication among their programs,other programs, and insurance benefits; and (4) To coordinate the effort of agencies providing assistance so that eachagency understands the prevention and remedial policies of the others andis able to fulfill its own responsibilities regarding duplication of benefits.(d) <T3>Guidance to prevent duplication of benefits. </T3>(1) Delivery sequence.FEMA provides the following policy and procedural guidance to ensure uniformityin preventing duplication of benefits.(i) Duplication occurs when an agency has provided assistance which wasthe primary responsibility of another agency, and the agency with primaryresponsibility later provides assistance. A delivery sequence establishesthe order in which disaster relief agencies and organizations provide assistance.The specific sequence, in accordance with the mandates of the assistanceprograms, is to be generally followed in the delivery of assistance. (ii) When the delivery sequence has been disrupted, the disrupting agencyis responsible for rectifying the duplication. The delivery sequence pertainsto that period of time in the recovery phase when most of the traditionaldisaster assistance programs are available. (2) The delivery sequence is, in order of delivery: (i) Volunteer agencies' emergency assistance (except expendable items suchas clothes, linens, and basic kitchenware); insurance (including floodinsurance); (ii) Temporary housing assistance (to include provision of a housing unitand minimal repairs); (iii) Small Business Administration and Farmers Home Administration disasterloans; (iv) Individuals and Family Grant program assistance; (v) Volunteer agencies' ``additional assistance'' programs; and (vi) The ``Cora Brown Fund.'' (3) Two significant points about the delivery sequence are that: (i) Each assistance agency should, in turn, offer and be responsible fordelivering assistance without regard to duplication with a program laterin the sequence; and (ii) The sequence itself determines what types of assistance can duplicateother assistance (i.e., a Federal program can duplicate insurance benefits,however, insurance benefits cannot duplicate the Federal assistance). Anagency's position in the sequence determines the order in which it shouldprovide assistance and what other resources it must consider before itdoes so. (4) If following the delivery sequence concept would adversely affect thetimely receipt of essential assistance by a disaster victim, an agencymay offer assistance which is the primary responsibility of another agency.There also may be cases when an agency (Agency B) delivers assistance whichis normally the primary responsibility of another agency (Agency A) becauseAgency A has, for good cause, denied assistance. After the assistance isdelivered, Agency A reopens the case. If the primary response Agency Athen provides assistance, that Agency A is responsible for coordinatingwith Agency B to either: (i) Assist Agency B in preventing the duplication of benefits, or (ii) In the case where the disaster victim has refused assistance fromAgency A, notify Agency B that it must recover assistance previously provided.(e) <T3>Program guidance. </T3>(1) Programs under the Act vs. other agencyassistance. (i) In making an eligibility determination, the FEMA Regional Director,in the case of federally operated programs, or the State, in the case ofState operated programs, shall determine whether assistance is the primaryresponsibility of another agency to provide, according to the deliverysequence; and determine whether that primary response agency can provideassistance in a timely way. (ii) If it is determined that timely assistance can be provided by theagency with primary responsibility, refrain from providing assistance underthe Act. If it is determined that assistance from the agency with primaryresponsibility will be delayed, assistance under the Act may be provided,but then must be recovered from the applicant when the other assistancebecomes available. (2) Programs under the Act vs. insurance. In making an eligibility determination,the FEMA Regional Director or State shall: (i) Remind the applicant about his/her responsibility to pursue an adequatesettlement. The applicant must provide information concerning insurancerecoveries. (ii) Determine whether the applicant's insurance settlement will be sufficientto cover the loss or need without disaster assistance; and (iii) Determine whether insurance benefits (including flood insurance)will be provided in a timely way. Where flood insurance is involved, theRegional Director shall coordinate with the Federal Insurance Administration.The purpose of this coordination is to obtain information about flood insurancecoverage and settlements. (3) Random sample. Each disaster assistance agency is responsible for preventingand rectifying duplication of benefits under the coordination of the FederalCoordinating Officer (FCO) and the general authority of section 312. Todetermine whether duplication has occurred and established procedures havebeen followed, the Regional Director shall, within 90 days after the closeof the disaster assistance programs application period, for selected disasterdeclarations, examine on a random sample basis, FEMA's and other governmentand voluntary agencies' case files and document the findings in writing.(4) Duplication when assistance under the Act is involved. If duplicationis discovered, the Regional Director shall determine whether the duplicatingagency followed its own remedial procedures. (i) If the duplicating agency followed its procedures and was successfulin correcting the duplication, the Regional Director will take no furtheraction. If the agency was not successful in correcting the duplication,and the Regional Director is satisfied that the duplicating agency followedits remedial procedures, no further action will be taken. (ii) If the duplicating agency did not follow its duplication of benefitsprocedures, or the Regional Director is not satisfied that the procedureswere followed in an acceptable manner, then the Regional Director shallprovide an opportunity for the agency to take the required corrective action.If the agency cannot fulfill its responsibilities for remedial action,the Regional Director shall notify the recipient of the excess assistance,and after examining the debt, if it is determined that the likelihood ofcollecting the debt and the best interests of the Federal Government justifytaking the necessary recovery actions, then take those recovery actionsin conjunction with agency representatives for each identified case inthe random sample (or larger universe, at the Regional Director's discretion).(5) Duplication when assistance under other authorities is involved. Whenthe random sample shows evidence that duplication has occurred and correctiveaction is required, the Regional Director and the FCO shall urge the duplicatingagency to follow its own procedures to take corrective action, and shallwork with the agency toward that end. Under his/her authority in section312, the Regional Director shall require the duplicating agency to reportto him/her on its attempt to correct the duplications identified in thesample. (f) <T3>Recovering FEMA funds: debt collection. </T3>Funds due to FEMA arerecovered in accordance with FEMA's Debt Collection Regulations (44 CFRPart 11, Subpart C). <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;andSection; 206.192 through 206.199 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart G_Public Assistance Project Administration </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.200</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Purpose. </T3>This subpart establishes procedures for the administrationof Public Assistance grants approved under the provisions of the StaffordAct.

The regulationentitled ``Uniform Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements toState and Local Governments,'' published at 44 CFR Part 13, places certainrequirements on the State in its role as grantee for the public assistanceprogram. The intent of this ``common rule'' is to allow States more discretionin administering Federal programs in accordance with their own proceduresand thereby simplify the program and reduce delays. FEMA expects Statesto make subgrants with the Act's requirement in mind. Subgrantees shouldreceive the full payment approved by FEMA and the State contribution asprovided in the FEMA-State Agreement as soon as practicable after paymentis approved.

CBRA prohibitsnew expenditures and new financial assistance within the Coastal BarrierResources System (CBRS) for all but a few types of activities identifiedin CBRA. This subpart specifies what actions may and may not be carriedout within the CBRS. It establishes procedures for compliance with CBRAin the administration of disaster assistance by FEMA. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.341</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy. </ITAG>It shall be the policy of FEMA to achieve the goals of CBRA in carryingout disaster relief on units of the Coastal Barrier Resources System. Itis FEMA's intent that such actions be consistent with the purpose of CBRAto minimize the loss of human life, the wasteful expenditure of Federalrevenues, and the damage to fish, wildlife and other natural resourcesassociated with coastal barriers along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts andto consider the means and measures by which the long-term conservationof these fish, wildlife, and other natural resources may be achieved underthe Stafford Act. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.342</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the definitions set forthin Part 206 of Subchapter D are applicable to this subject. (a) ``Consultation'' means that process by which FEMA informs the Secretaryof the Interior through his/her designated agent of FEMA proposed disasterassistance actions on a designated unit of the Coastal Barrier ResourcesSystem and by which the Secretary makes comments to FEMA about the appropriatenessof that action. Approval by the Secretary is not required in order thatan action be carried out. (b) ``Essential link'' means that portion of a road, utility, or otherfacility originating outside of the system unit but providing access orservice through the unit and for which no alterative route is reasonablyavailable.

In addition, a legally valid building permit or equivalentdocumentation, if required, must have been obtained for the constructionprior to October 18, 1982. If a facility has been substantially improvedor expanded since October 18, 1982, it is not an existing facility. Forany other unit added to the CBRS by amendment to Pub. L. 97-348, the enactmentdate of such amendment is substituted for October 18, 1982, in this definition.(d) ``Expansion'' means changing a facility to increase its capacity orsize. (e) ``Facility'' means ``public facility'' as defined in 206.201. Thisincludes any publicly owned flood control, navigation, irrigation, reclamation,public power, sewage treatment and collection, water supply and distribution,watershed development, or airport facility; and nonfederal-aid street,road, or highway; and any other public building, structure, or system,including those used for educational, recreational, or cultural purposes,or any park.(f) ``Financial assistance'' means any form of Federal loan, grant guaranty,insurance, payment rebate, subsidy or any other form of direct or indirectFederal assistance.

Permanent construction for a structuredoes not include land preparation such as clearing, grading, and placementof fill, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, or piers.For a facility which is not a structure, start of construction means thefirst activity for permanent construction of a substantial part of thefacility. Permanent construction for a facility does not include land preparationsuch as clearing and grubbing but would include excavation and placementof fill such as for a road. (i) ``Structure'' means a walled and roofed building, including a gas orliquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a mobilehome. (j) ``Substantial improvement'' means any repair, reconstruction or otherimprovement of a structure or facility, that has been damaged in excessof, or the cost of which equals or exceeds, 50 percent of the market valueof the structure or placement cost of the facility (including all ``publicfacilities'' as defined in the Stafford Act) either: (1) Before the repair or improvement is started; or (2) If the structure or facility has been damaged and is proposed to berestored, before the damage occurred. If a facility is a link in a largersystem, the percentage of damage will be based on the relative cost ofrepairing the damaged facility to the replacement cost of that portionof the system which is operationally dependent on the facility.

In addition, State law must not prohibitthe local government from incurring the indebtedness resulting from a Federalloan. (2) Criteria considered by FEMA in determining the eligibility of a localgovernment for a Community Disaster Loan include the loss of tax and otherrevenues as a result of a major disaster, a demonstrated need for financialassistance in order to perform its governmental functions, the maintenanceof an annual operating budget, and the responsibility to provide essentialmunicipal operating services to the community. Eligibility for other assistanceunder the Act does not, by itself, establish entitlement to such a loan.(b) <T3>Loan eligibility</T3>_(1) <T3>General.</T3> To be eligible, the local government must show that itmay suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenuesas a result of a major disaster or emergency and must demonstrate a needfor financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions.Loan eligibility is based on the financial condition of the local governmentand a review of financial information and supporting justification accompanyingthe application. (2)<T3> Substantial loss of tax and other revenues.</T3> The fiscal year ofthe disaster or the succeeding fiscal year is the base period for determiningwhether a local government may suffer or has suffered a substantial lossof revenue. Criteria used in determining whether a local government hasor may suffer a substantial loss of tax and other revenue include the followingdisaster-related factors: (i) Whether the disaster caused a large enough reduction in cash receiptsfrom normal revenue sources, excluding borrowing, which affects significantlyand adversely the level and/or categories of essential municipal servicesprovided prior to the disaster; (ii) Whether the disaster caused a revenue loss of over 5 percent of totalrevenue estimated for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred orfor the succeeding fiscal year; (3) <T3>Demonstrated need for financial assistance.</T3> The local governmentmust demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to perform itsgovernmental functions. The criteria used in making this determinationinclude the following: (i) Whether there is sufficient funds to meet current fiscal year operatingrequirement; (ii) Whether there is availability of cash or other liquid assets fromthe prior fiscal year; (iii) Current financial condition considering projected expenditures forgovernmental services and availability of other financial resources; (iv) Ability to obtain financial assistance or needed revenue from Stateand other Federal agencies for direct program expenditures; (v) Debt ratio (relationship of annual receipts to debt service); (vi) Ability to obtain financial assistance or needed revenue from Stateand other Federal agencies for direct program expenditures; (vii) Displacement of revenue-producing business due to property destruction;(viii) Necessity to reduce or eliminate essential municipal services; and(ix) Danger of municipal insolvency. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.364</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Loan application. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Application.</T3> (1) The local government shall submit an applicationfor a Community Disaster Loan through the GAR.

The loan application shallbe prepared by the affected local government and be approved by the GAR.FEMA has determined that a local government, in applying for a loan asa result of having suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenueas a result of a major disaster, is not required to first seek credit elsewhere(see andSection; 206.367(c)). (2) The State exercises administrative authority over the local government'sapplication. The State's review should include a determination that theapplicant is legally qualified, under State law, to assume the proposeddebt, and may include an overall review for accuracy for the submission.The Governor's Authorized Representative may request the Regional Directorto waive the requirement for a State review if an otherwise eligible applicantis not subject to State administration authority and the State cannot legallyparticipate in the loan application process.

(2) Operating Budget. For loan application purposes, the operating budgetis that document or documents approved by an appropriating body, whichcontains an estimate of proposed expenditures, other than capital outlaysfor fixed assets for a stated period of time, and the proposed means offinancing the expenditures. For loan cancellation purposes, FEMA interpretsthe term ``operating budget'' to mean actual revenues and expendituresof the local government as published in the official financial statementsof the local government. (3) Operating budget increases. Budget increases due to increases in thelevel of, or additions to, municipal services not rendered at the of thedisaster or not directly related to the disaster shall be identified. (4) Revenue and assessment information. The applicant shall provide informationconcerning its method of tax assessment including assessment dates andthe dates payments are due. Tax revenues assessed but not collected, orother revenues which the local government chooses to forgive, stay, orotherwise not exercise the right to collect, are not a legitimate revenueloss for purposes of evaluating the loan application. (5) Estimated disaster-related expense. Unreimbursed disaster-related expensesof a municipal operation character should be estimated. These are discussedin andSection; 206.366(b). (c) <T3>Federal review. </T3>(1) The Associate Director or designee shall approvea community disaster loan to the extent it is determined that the localgovernment has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues anddemonstrates a need for financial assistance to perform its governmentalfunction as the result of the disaster.

Decision by the AssociateDirector on the resubmission is final. (d) <T3>Community disaster loan. </T3>(1) The loan shall not exceed the lesserof: (i) The amount of projected revenue loss plus the projected unreimburseddisaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character for the fiscalyear of the major disaster and the subsequent 3 fiscal years, or (ii) 25 percent of the local government's annual operating budget for thefiscal year in which the disaster occurred. (2) Promissory note. (i) Upon approval of the loan by the Associate Directoror designee, he or she, or a designated Loan Officer will execute a PromissoryNote with the applicant. The Note must be cosigned by the State (see andSection;206.364(d)(2)(ii)). The applicant should indicate its funding requirementson the Schedule of Loan Increments on the note. (ii) If the State cannot legally cosign the promissory note, the localgovernment must pledge collateral security, acceptable to the AssociateDirector, to cover the principal amount of the note. The pledge shouldbe in the form of a resolution by the local governing body identifyingthe collateral security.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Approved by Office of Management and Budget under Control Number3067-0034) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.365</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Loan Administration. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Funding. </T3>(1) FEMA will disburse funds to the local governmentwhen requested, generally in accordance with the Schedule of Loan Incrementsin the Promissory Note. As funds are disbursed, interest will accrue againsteach disbursement. (2) When each incremental disbursement is requested, the local governmentshall submit a copy of its most recent financial report (if not submittedpreviously) for consideration by FEMA in determining whether the leveland frequency of periodic payments continue to be justified. The localgovernment shall also provide the latest available data on anticipatedand actual tax and other revenue collections. Desired adjustments in thedisbursement schedule shall be submitted in writing at least 10 days priorto the proposed disbursement date in order to ensure timely receipt ofthe funds. A sinking fund should be established to amortize the debt.(b) <T3>Financial management. </T3>(1) Each local government with an approvedCommunity Disaster Loan shall establish necessary accounting records, consistentwith local government's financial management system, to account for loanfunds received and disbursed and to provide an audit trail. (2) FEMA auditors, State auditors, the GAR, the Regional Director, theAssociate Director, and the Comptroller General of the United States ortheir duly authorized representatives shall for the purpose of audits andexamination have access to any books, documents, papers, and records thatpertain to Federal funds, equipments, and supplies received under theseregulations. (c) <T3>Loan servicing. </T3>(1) The applicant annually shall submit to FEMAcopies of its annual financial reports (operating statements, balance sheets,etc.) for the fiscal year of the major disaster, and for each of the 3subsequent fiscal years. (2) The Headquarters, FEMA Office of Disaster Assistance Programs, willreview the loan periodically. The purpose of the reevaluation is to determinewhether projected revenue losses, disaster-related expenses, operatingbudgets, and other factors have changed sufficiently to warrant adjustmentof the scheduled disbursement of the loan proceeds. (3) The Headquarters, FEMA Office of Disaster Assistance Programs, shallprovide each loan recipient with a loan status report on a quarterly basis.The recipient will notify FEMA of any changes of the responsible municipalofficial who executed the Promissory Note. (d) <T3>Inactive loans. </T3>If no funds have been disbursed from the Treasury,and if the local government does not anticipate a need for such funds,the note may be cancelled at any time upon a written request through theState and Regional Office to FEMA. However, since only one loan may beapproved, cancellation precludes submission of a second loan applicationrequest by the same local government for the same disaster. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.366 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Loan cancellation. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Policies. </T3>(1) FEMA shall cancel repayment of all or any part ofa Community Disaster Loan to the extent that the Associate Director determinesthat revenues of the local government during the full three fiscal yearperiod following the disaster are insufficient, as a result of the disaster,to meet the operating budget of the local government, including additionalunreimbursed disaster-related expenses for a municipal operating character.For loan cancellation purposes, FEMA interprets that term ``operating budget''to mean actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as publishedin the official financial statements of the local government. (2) If the tax and other revenues rates or the tax assessment valuationof property which was not damaged or destroyed by the disaster is reducedduring the 3 fiscal years subsequent to the major disaster, the tax andother revenue rates and tax assessment valuation factors applicable tosuch property in effect at the time of the major disaster shall be usedwithout reduction for purposes of computing revenues received. This mayresult in decreasing the potential for loan cancellations. (3) If the local government's fiscal year is changed during the ``full3 year period following the disaster'' the actual period will be modifiedso that the required financial data submitted covers an inclusive 36-monthperiod. (4) If the local government transfers funds from its operating funds accountsto its capital funds account, utilizes operating funds for other than routinemaintenance purposes, or significantly increases expenditures not disasterrelated, except increase due to inflation, the annual operating budgetor operating statement expenditures will be reduced accordingly for purposesof evaluating any request for loan cancellation. (5) It is not the purpose of this loan program to underwrite predisasterbudget or actual deficits of the local government. Consequently, such deficitscarried forward will reduce any amounts otherwise eligible for loan cancellation.(b) <T3>Disaster-related expenses of a municipal operation character. </T3>(1)For purpose of this loan, unreimbursed expenses of a municipal operatingcharacter are those incurred for general government purposes, such as policeand fire protection, trash collection, collection of revenues, maintenanceof public facilities, flood and other hazard insurance, and other expensesnormally budgeted for the general fund, as defined by the Municipal FinanceOfficers Association. (2) Disaster-related expenses do not include expenditures associated withdebt service, any major repairs, rebuilding, replacement or reconstructionof public facilities or other capital projects, intragovernmental services,special assessments, and trust and agency fund operations. Disaster expenseswhich are eligible for reimbursement under project applications or otherFederal programs are not eligible for loan cancellation. (3) Each applicant shall maintain records including documentation necessaryto identify expenditures for unreimbursed disaster related expenses. Examplesof such expenses include but are not limited to: (i) Interest paid on money borrowed to pay amounts FEMA does not advancetoward completion of approved Project Applications. (ii) Unreimbursed costs to local governments for providing usable siteswith utilities for mobile homes used to meet disaster temporary housingrequirements. (iii) Unreimbursed costs required for police and fire protection and othercommunity services for mobile home parks established as the result of orfor use following a disaster. (iv) The cost to the applicant of flood insurance required under Pub. L.93-234, as amended, and other hazard insurance required under section 311,Pub L. 93-288, as amended, as a condition of Federal disaster assistancefor the disaster under which the loan is authorized.(4) The following expenses are not considered to be disaster-related forCommunity Disaster Loan purposes. (i) The local government's share for assistance provided under the Actincluding flexible funding under section 406(c)(1) of the Act. (ii) Improvements related to the repair or restoration of disaster publicfacilities approved on Project Applications. (iii) Otherwise eligible costs for which no Federal reimbursement is requestedas a part of the applicant's disaster response commitment, or cost sharingas specified in the FEMA-State Agreement for the disaster. (iv) Expenses incurred by the local government which are reimbursed onthe applicant's project application. (c) <T3>Cancellation application. </T3>A local government which has drawn loanfunds from the Treasury may request cancellation of the principal and relatedinterest by submitting an Application for Loan Cancellation through theGovernor's Authorized Representative to the Regional Director prior tothe expiration date of the loan. (1) Financial information submitted with the application shall includethe following: (i) Annual Operating Budgets for the fiscal year of the disaster and the3 subsequent fiscal years; (ii) Annual Financial Reports (Revenue and Expense and Balance Sheet) foreach of the above fiscal years. Such financial records must include copiesof the local government's annual financial reports, including operatingstatements balance sheets and related consolidated and individual presentationsfor each fund account. In addition, the local government must include anexplanatory statement when figures in the Application for Loan Cancellationform differ from those in the supporting financial reports.

The application may include a narrative presentationto amplify the financial material accompanying the application and to presentany extenuating circumstances which the local government wants the AssociateDirector to consider in rendering a decision on the cancellation request.(d) <T3>Determination. </T3>(1) If, based on a review of the Application forLoan Cancellation and FEMA audit, when determined necessary, the AssociateDirector determines that all or part of the Community Disaster Loan fundsshould be cancelled, the principal amount which is cancelled will becomea grant, and the related interest will be forgiven. The Associate Director'sdetermination concerning loan cancellation will specify that any uncancelledprincipal and related interest must be repaid immediately and that, ifimmediate repayment will constitute a financial hardship, the local governmentmust submit for FEMA review and approval, a repayment schedule for settlingthe indebtedness on timely basis. Such repayments must be made to the Treasurerof the United States and be sent to FEMA, Attention: Office of the Comptroller.(2) A loan or cancellation of a loan does not reduce or affect other disaster-relatedgrants or other disaster assistance. However, no cancellation may be madethat would result in a duplication of benefits to the applicant. (3) The uncancelled portion of the loan must be repaid in accordance withandSection; 206.367. (4) Appeals. If an Application for Loan Cancellation is disapproved, inwhole or in part, by the Associate Director or designee, the local governmentmay submit any additional information in support of the application within60 days of the date of disapproval.

If any portion of the loan is cancelled, the interestamount due will be computed on the remaining principal with the shortestoutstanding term. (3) Each payment made against the loan will be applied first to the interestcomputed to the date of the payment, and then to the principal. Prepaymentsof scheduled installments, or any portion thereof, may be made at any timeand shall be applied to the installments last to become due under the loanand shall not affect the obligation of the borrower to pay the remaininginstallments.

(b) <T3>Applicability.</T3> This subpart covers actions, procedures, standards,and criteria for accomplishing optimum results in reduction, avoidanceand mitigation of all types of future disasters. These regulations areintended for the use of federal, State and local governments, as well asorganizations and individuals administering or receiving Federal grantor local assistance as the result of a major disaster or emergency. Theyare also intended to complement and reinforce implementation in other subpartsof these regulations:(1) The President's executive Order 11988 on Floodplain Management andExecutive Order 11990 on Protection of Wetlands; and (2) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 Pub.

As used in this subpart: (a) ``Avoidance'' means to eliminate a hazard through measures such asrelocation or prohibition of construction within an area susceptible torisk or danger, or by other means. (b) ``Construction practices'' means codes, standards, and specificationsapplicable to repairs, or to alterations or new construction of a facilityor structure. (c) ``Disaster proofing'' means those minimum alterations or modificationsto damaged facilities that could be expected to prevent or substantiallyreduce future damages to the repaired or reconstructed facility, or tomake it disaster resistant. (d) ``Hazard'' means any natural source of danger or element of risk identifiedfollowing a major disaster or emergency. (e) ``Land use regulations'' include zoning for purposes compatible withprudent floodplain management and both preventive and corrective restrictionson construction, repairs, or alterations of facilities within specifiedareas. Preventive restrictions provide regulation of new land use, i.e.,nonstructural disaster control measures such as use of high hazard areasfor parks, farms, and recreational areas. Corrective restrictions include:(1) Floodproofing; (2) Acquisition; (3) Insurance; (4) Removal of non-conforming uses. (f) ``Mitigation'' means to alleviate by softening and making less severethe effects of a major disaster or emergency and of future disasters inthe affected areas, including reduction or avoidance.(g) ``Reduction'' means to diminish in strength and intensity or to restrictor lessen the size, amount and extent of damage resulting from the majordisaster or emergency or to be expected as the result of future disasters.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.402</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy. </ITAG>(a) The FEMA role under section 409 of the Act is one of providing leadership,not through mandates, but through governments and assistance to them intheir initiatives to develop and maintain effective mitigation standards.FEMA must provide realistic and attainable mitigation options for theirconsideration and adoption. Ultimately, improved programs can only be developedwhen each party understands the benefits to be gained through hazard mitigationand is willing to work in a shared environment of cooperation and commitment.(b) While the need to respond quickly to disaster and life-threateningcondition must remain paramount, FEMA shall assure that the ultimate benefitsto be gained through effective hazard mitigation programs are not diminishedand remain a primary objective. (c) FEMA shall provide technical advice and assistance for hazard mitigationto local or State governments and to certain private nonprofit organizationseligible for grant assistance under section 406 of the Stafford Act. Suchtechnical advice and assistance shall be supplementary to that availablefrom any other State or Federal agencies under their existing programs.Technical advice may also be provided for water conservation measures inaffected areas short of water as the result of the major disaster or emergency.(d) FEMA shall encourage local or State governments to adopt safe land-useregulations and construction practices or standards. When such action istaken, after the declaration of a major disaster or emergency, the AssociateDirector may approve such regulations, practices or standards as applicabledeviations as a condition for any Federal grants under section 406 of theStafford Act. When such action is not taken, the Associate Director maystill prescribe appropriate standards as applicable to federally-assistedprojects resulting from the major disaster or emergency being restoredunder section 406 of the Act. The Associate Director may also prescribesuch standards for prospective applicability to all similar repairs ornew construction of facilities within the applicant's jurisdiction. Insuch instances, the applicant shall be notified in writing by the RegionalDirector through the State of these prescribed standards and that any futuredamages or destruction of facilities due to failure to comply with suchprescribed standards would not be eligible for FEMA grant assistance undersection 406, except under unusual circumstances when approved in the publicinterest by the Associate Director. (e) Local governments usually have the decision-making responsibility withintheir jurisdictions for hazard mitigation measures, including sound land-useregulations and safe construction practices. The State has the centralrole in resource management and in hazard mitigation throughout the State.Federal technical advice and assistance is supplementary in nature. (f) FEMA recognizes the heavy administrative workloads of local and Stategovernments in coping with major disasters or emergencies and, in initiatingany hazard mitigation programs, it will be sensitive to these existingworkloads. In developing any proposed implementation plan and procedures,FEMA emphasis is to focus the efforts of all participants on achievingpositive results in hazard mitigation. It encourages initiative by Stateand local governments within the context of their laws, regulations, andcustoms.(g) For all major disasters and emergencies involving actions or affectingin floodplains or wetlands appropriate hazard mitigation measures shallbe taken as required by FEMA's Floodplain Management regulations (44 CFRPart 9).(h) Nonstructural disaster protection methods or measures shall be fullyconsidered and emphasized where consistent with primary program purposesof the Act. (i) As a condition for any grant for federally assisted projects undersection 406 of the Act, the Associate Director has prescribed as a standard,floodproofing measures which the Regional Director determines are appropriateand practicable as disaster-proofing under E.O. 11988 for facilities withinthe 100-year floodplain or for critical facilities within the 500-yearfloodplain. (j) During hazard mitigation actions involving water resources under thesubpart, the State shall be the focal point for water resource management.(k) As a condition for any grant or loan under the Act for municipal watersupply or waste water treatment facilities or systems, appropriate waterconservation requirements shall be included and any disincentives to waterconservation shall be removed. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.403</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Responsibilities. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>After a declaration of a major disaster or emergencycoordinated effort of all participants is required to identify the significanthazards and appropriate mitigation measures to cope with those hazards.(b) <T3>FEMA. </T3>The Regional Director shall include appropriate provisionsfor hazard mitigation under this subpart in the FEMA-State Agreement. He/sheshall coordinate with the Governor's Authorized Representative to providefor a joint Federal/State team to survey the disaster affected area soonafter a major disaster or emergency declaration for these purposes:(1) Identify significant hazards in the affected area, giving priorityto disaster-related hazards;(2) Evaluate the impacts of these hazards and measures which will mitigatethese impacts; and(3) Recommend appropriate hazard mitigation measures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Regional Director shall designate a FEMA staff member to serveas Hazard Mitigation Coordinator (HMC) on the FEMA/State survey team andto confer with local, State and Federal officials concerning these hazardsand hazard mitigation measures. Based on these consultations by the FEMAHMC and the Regional Director, and on decisions by local or State agencieswhich may establish new or modified land use regulations or standards,the Regional Director may recommend that the Associate Director approveor prescribe appropriate standards. The Regional Director shall also designatea FEMA planner to serve on the FEMA/State planning teams. Concurrentlywith the FEMA/State survey team activities, the FEMA planner shall coordinatewith the State planner designated by the Governor's Authorized Representativein working with participating Federal, State and local agencies, organizationsor individuals in accomplishing hazard mitigation planning as requiredby the Regional Director in accordance with 44 CFR 206.403(e), 206.405,206.410(b), and  206.411(c). The Regional Director may provide technicaladvice and assistance to local or State agencies for the purpose of accomplishinghazard mitigation activities under this subpart. He/she shall review Stateevidence of compliance with approved hazard mitigation activities and shallprovide to the Associate Director an after-action report when all suchhazard mitigation activities are completed or terminated. Because the RegionalDirector requires that each applicant take appropriate hazard mitigationmeasures as a condition for approval of a FEMA grant or loan, he/she shallfollow up with the State to recover Federal funding whenever an applicantfails to satisfy any conditions upon which the approval of the grant wasbased. The Regional Director may arrange for other Federal agencies toparticipate in hazard mitigation activities under this subpart. (c) <T3>State. </T3>The Governor's Authorized Representative is responsiblefor State performance of hazard mitigation activities under the FEMA-StateAgreement and this subpart. He/she shall designate a State Hazard MitigationCoordinator (HMC) to serve on the FEMA/State survey team and a State plannerto serve on the FEMA/State hazard mitigation planning team. The Governor'sAuthorized Representative shall arrange for State and local participationin FEMA/State surveys and FEMA/State planning in the affected areas ofthe State for purposes stated above. The State HMC shall arrange for consultationson the findings and recommendations from the joint survey and shall followup to assure that timely and adequate local and State hazard mitigationactions are taken. Whenever appropriate, he/she shall arrange for Statefunding or technical assistance to eligible applicants for the purposesof accomplishing State-approved hazard mitigation actions. He/she shallarrange for State inspection or audit to verify compliance with approvedhazard mitigation measures. When these activities are completed in accordancewith the FEMA-State Agreement, he/she shall submit a final report of compliancewith hazard mitigation requirements by State and local governments to theRegional Director for review and acceptance. Similarly, the State plannershall work with the FEMA planner in accomplishing the tasks referencedin paragraph (b) of this section. (d) <T3>Local. </T3>The applicant is responsible for local performance of hazardmitigation measures under the FEMA-State Agreement and this subpart. Eachapplicant shall designate a local Hazard Mitigation Coordinator (HMC) towork with the FEMA/State survey team as required by the State HMC. Workingwith the FEMA/State survey team, the local HMC will assess the damage withinthe local jurisdiction. The local HMC shall arrange for local participationin consultations with FEMA/State survey teams about hazard mitigation actionsunder this subpart. The local HMC is responsible for informing local officialsand interested citizens about significant survey teams activities. He/sheshall also collect any local comments on these matters and report themto the State HMC. With any project application, each applicant shall submitadequate assurances that any required hazard mitigation measures have beentaken or will be completed. The applicant, to the extent of its legal authority,is responsible for implementing and enforcing land use regulations andsafe construction practices which are conditions agreed upon for FEMA grantsor loans. The applicant shall provide evidence of compliance with conditionsfor any approved FEMA grants or loans as required by the Governor's AuthorizedRepresentative. The applicant's local Authorized Representative shall arrangefor the applicant's planner to work with the FEMA/State planning team inreviewing and updated existing hazard mitigation plans, or in developingnew hazard mitigation plans as may be scheduled by the Governor's AuthorizedRepresentative and requested by the Regional Director. (e) <T3>FEMA-State Agreement. </T3>When necessary to clarify responsibilitiesunder this subpart for a major disaster and emergency, clarification shallbe provided by amendment to the FEMA-State Agreement. The following isa typical paragraph: <ITAG tagnum="75">Hazard Mitigation Clause Added to the Federal-State Agreement </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``The State agrees that, as a condition for any Federal loan or grant,the State or the applicant shall evaluate the natural hazards in the areasin which the proceeds of the grants or loans are to be used and shall makeappropriate recommendations to mitigate such hazards for federally assistedprojects. The State further agrees: (1) To follow up with applicants, withinState capabilities, to assure that, as a condition for any grant or loanunder the Act, appropriate hazard mitigation actions are taken; (2) toprepare and submit not later than 180 days after the declaration to theRegional Director for concurrence, hazard mitigation plan or plans forthe designated areas, and (3) to review and update as necessary disastermitigation portions of the emergency plans.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``The Regional Director agrees to make Federal technical advice andassistance available to support the planning efforts and actions.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.404</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Surveys. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Damage assessments. </T3>Prior to a declaration of a major disasteror emergency, local State and Federal preliminary assessments of damagemay identify major hazards and opportunities for hazard mitigation actions.This information will be transmitted to the FEMA/State survey team as indicatedbelow. During the period immediately following a major disaster or emergency,each applicant is expected to use its resources and capabilities as necessaryto perform emergency work, such as debris removal or emergency measuresto save lives, or to protect public health and safety or to protect property.The identification of hazards by the damage assessment team and the performanceof the emergency work may result in significant hazard mitigation. DamageSurvey Reports (DSR) completed by Federal inspectors will also includeidentification of hazards and recommendations of mitigation measures tobe incorporated in the repair work. (b) <T3>Survey activities. </T3>After a declaration of a major disaster oremergency, the Governor's Authorized Representative shall schedule a briefingfor State staff members about their participation in FEMA/State surveyteam activities. The survey team shall be made up of the FEMA HMC and theState HMC, plus other Federal or State staff members or consultants. ThisFEMA/State survey team shall work with the appropriate local HMC. Utilizingthe information from the preliminary damage assessments, the DSR's referredto above, and all other pertinent information readily available, the surveyteam shall visit the sites of significant damage to evaluate the hazards.This evaluation may include investigation of selected individual damagedfacilities plus review of applicable land use regulations, constructionstandards, and other appropriate hazard mitigation measures. The federal/Statesurvey team shall work with the local HMC and other local officials asnecessary during this evaluation. The FEMA HMC shall supply model regulations,suggested standards, and other pertinent references for use by the surveyteam. For each identified significant hazard the survey team shall includeappropriate recommendations of hazard mitigation measures in its finalreport (see 44 CFR 206.411(c)). <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.405</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Hazard mitigation plans. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Plans. </T3>For each hazard-prone area, the FEMA/State planning teamshall review and evaluate existing local or State emergency plans for hazardmitigation. Particular attention shall be given to the adequacy of plansfor warning and evacuation. In those cases where no such plans exist, thisplanning team shall report its findings and recommendations concerningspecific needs to develop and maintain such plans. The Regional Directorshall require the State to update existing State or local plans or to developsuch new hazard mitigation plans as he/she deems necessary in consultationwith the Governor's Authorized Representative. In determining whether toimpose such a requirement on a local government, consideration shall begiven to the opportunities presented for effective hazard mitigation, thesize and composition of the local government, the local government's authorityto regulate land use and to require safe construction practices, and thelocal government's exercise of such authority. The Governor's AuthorizedRepresentative, or Regional Director, may provide technical advice andassistance to State agencies or local governments in developing new plansor updating existing plans to mitigate hazards identified as the resultof the major disaster or emergency within the affected areas. (b) <T3>Objectives. </T3>The identification of hazards following a major disasteror emergency and accomplishment of appropriate hazard mitigation measuresare the short-term planning objectives to be required by the FEMA-StateAgreement. The Regional Director and the Governor's Authorized Representativeshall focus with highest priority on these objectives in verifying compliancewith the Agreement as a condition for Federal loans or grants. (c) <T3>Mapping. </T3>The FEMA/State planning team shall verify the impactof the major disaster on disaster frequencies computed prior to the majordisaster through contacts with agencies maintaining such records. Thisplanning team shall also consider the advisability of redefining boundariesof high-hazard areas as the result of their findings and shall make recommendationsto the Regional Director on any needs for new mapping of high hazard areas.(d) <T3>Schedules. </T3>In its recommendations of appropriate hazard mitigationmeasures, the planning team shall suggest target dates and schedules foraccomplishment of each recommended measure. (e) <T3>Measures as conditions for FEMA assistance. </T3>Measures which relateonly to specific construction projects shall be specified as conditionsfor approval of applicable FEMA grants or loans. Those hazard mitigationmeasures which require other actions by applicants for FEMA grants of loansshall be reported by the FEMA/State survey team to the Governor's AuthorizedRepresentative, for referral to the FEMA/State planning team or other appropriateaction. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.406</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Hazard mitigation measures. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>Certain types of actions may be taken to achieve hazardmitigation including: (1) Avoidance, (2) Reduction, and(3) Adoption and enforcement of land use regulations and of safe constructionpractices.(b) <T3>Avoidance. </T3>For siting new construction of facilities or structures,location outside of high hazard areas is the preferred solution. For eachhazard identified following a major disaster or emergency, the survey teamshall assess the feasibility of avoidance of high hazard areas in caseswhere new construction, alteration, or major repairs are involved in restorationof damaged or destroyed facilities. The survey team shall also make specificrecommendations concerning land use regulations and rezoning to achievethe objectives of avoidance whenever appropriate. (c) <T3>Reduction. </T3>Reduction of the effects of hazards on facilities andpeople may be achieved by reducing the area or level of the hazard itselfor by reducing the impact of the hazard on individual facilities. Examplesof the first are flood control projects such as dams, levees, floodwallsor channel improvements. In some situations, these may be the only practicablemeasures to protect facilities or structures already located in the floodplain.Reducing the impact on a facility may be accomplished by such measuresas installing shearwalls or bracing in buildings or installing check valvesin utility lines in earthquake-prone areas. In flood-prone areas, tie downsmay be used for mobile homes, lower levels of building may be waterproofed,water damage resistant materials may be used in reconstruction, or suchlower levels may be restricted to nonhazardous uses. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 205.407 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Land use regulations. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Local zoning. </T3>Regulation of land use within its jurisdiction isnormally a function of local government. In some cases, the local governmentmay have already adopted land use regulations or zoning prior to a majordisaster or emergency. Modification or updating based on current maps andmodel regulations may be necessary. Some re-mapping may frequently be required.In certain cases, the existing land use regulation may be adequate to copewith the identified hazards, if properly enforced. State, federal, or privateinterests may propose model zoning regulations, but adoption and enforcementof such regulations remain with the responsible State or local government.Certain State or Federal restrictions may be locally adopted and enforcedby mutual agreement, or as a condition for certain types of financial assistance.The survey team shall make its recommendation based on field observationsand evaluation of hazards within the affected areas. Consultations withthe applicant, the State HMC, and the FEMA HMC may then be necessary toidentify the applicant's options for decision making. The State or FEMAHMC shall provide encouragement, technical advice, and assistance to theapplicant to adopt and enforce appropriate land use regulations. The FEMA/Stateplanning team shall follow up on contacts with the State or local governmentif appropriate. (b) <T3>State land use regulations. </T3>For State-owned properties outsideof local jurisdiction, the responsible State agency adopts and enforcesland use regulations. In some cases, these State regulations may serveas model regulations for local governments. The planning team may makerecommendations on new State land use regulations for State lands and providetechnical advice and assistance to the State for developing such regulations.The State may require local adoption of Statewide land use regulationsas a condition for State aid, such as grants, loans, or technical assistance.(c) <T3>Federal land use regulations. </T3>For federally owned lands outsideof local or State jurisdictions, the responsible Federal agency adoptsand enforces land use regulations which may serve as models for local orState regulations in like circumstances. The FEMA/State planning team mayencourage the Federal agency to adopt land-use regulations currently usedlocally as being applicable to the Federal property. A Federal agency mayrequire local or State governments to adopt and enforce certain hazardmitigation regulations as a condition for Federal assistance or participationin federally assisted programs. For example, the National Flood InsuranceProgram requires certain minimum floodplain management regulations forparticipation by State or local government. Executive Order 11988 alsoimposes additional constraints on Federal grants or loan assistance withinthe floodplains. After reviewing a project application in accordance withFEMA's Floodplain Management regulation (44 CFR Part 9), the Regional Directormay determine that no practical alternative to locating in floodplain exists.The Regional Director then shall require appropriate measures to minimizeharm to the facility, to other property and to the floodplain and to preserveand restore the natural and beneficial values of the floodplain. Non-structuraluses of floodplains and wetlands, such as open space and parks, shall beencouraged whenever practicable. Coastal zone management plans impose similarrequirements for local, State, and Federal floodplain management regulation.As model hazard mitigation regulations become available to cope with othertypes of major disasters or emergencies including earthquakes, windstorms,and fires, the survey team may recommend them as requirements for federallyassisted projects, or for adoption and enforcement by applicants for Federalgrants or loan assistance. Survey or planning teams shall make findingsand recommendations as appropriate for development or updating of modelhazard-mitigation regulations by various Federal agencies for mitigationof hazards identified following a major disaster or emergency. The FEMAplanner may arrange for Federal technical advice and assistance to localor State governments in modifying model land use regulations to satisfylocal governments.(d) <T3>FEMA land use standards. </T3>As the result of a major disaster oremergency, the Regional Director may determine that there is no practicablealternative to permitting approval of a grant or loan for an action withina high hazard area. For example, refer to 44 CFR Part 9 covering the eight-stepdecisionmaking process for floodplain management. In these cases wherea practicable alternative exists outside the base floodplain, the RegionalDirector shall decline to approve a FEMA grant or loan unless the facilityor structure is relocated. The Regional Director may take similar actionfor other types of disasters, such as tornadoes or earthquakes, where apracticable alternative exists outside the high hazard area. Under theAct, the Associate Director may prescribe appropriate standards as applicablefor FEMA assisted projects as the result of a major disaster or emergency,as discussed in 44 CFR 206.402(d). When the Regional Director determinesthat restoration of a damaged or destroyed facility in a hazard area isnot a practicable alternative, he/she may decline to authorize FEMA disasterassistance to restore facilities at the original site, or within the hazardarea where such facilities are subject to repetitive heavy damages or destruction.When an applicant decides to relocate facilities being restored under section402 of the Act outside of a high hazard area, purchase and developmentof the site is the applicant's responsibility. The Regional Director mayapprove Federal grant assistance for permanent restoration of eligiblefacilities erected on the new site: Provided, That the Regional directordetermines that the Federal grant assistance for such project is practicableand in the public interest. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.408</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Construction practices. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>In certain cases, permanent repairs, alterations, ornew construction to predisaster design may not provide usable facilitiesor structures safe from identified hazards. Alternate actions availableare relocation; restorative work to conform to updated safe constructionpractices; or no approval for Federal funding of the proposed work. ForFEMA-assisted projects under the Act, the applicant's decision on standardsfor restorative work shall be subject to review and approval by the Governor'sAuthorized Representative and the Regional Director. In identifying hazardsand in its damage evaluation, the survey team shall inventory existingconstruction practices or standards related to damaged or destroyed facilitiesand may recommend adoption and enforcement by each applicant of additionalsafe construction practices. (b) <T3>Local standards. </T3>When a major disaster or emergency occurs, theFEMA/State survey team shall inventory and evaluate the standards alreadyadopted by the applicants for the types of repairs, reconstruction, orrestorative work for which Federal grant or loan assistance is being requested.During the field surveys this team, or the FEMA/State planning team mayalso have model State or Federal standards available for considerationby the applicants. Such standards for new construction may be differentfrom those for repairs or alterations to existing facilities or structures.Federal or State agencies may provide technical advice and assistance tolocal governments, particularly in the form of model standards to be modifiedfor local use. In discussions of hazard mitigation measures, the surveyteam or the planning team may develop appropriate recommendations to theapplicant for updating existing standards, or for adopting new ones. Asthe result of the major disaster or emergency, each applicant has the responsibilityfor adopting or updating appropriate standards and for enforcing them.Such local action for nonfederally funded projects shall be encouragedby the survey team and the planning team working together for a commonpurpose. An applicant may request State or FEMA technical advice and assistancein taking these actions. A new standard which the applicant submits forapproval by the Associate Director shall include the scope of applicationof the standard; that is, whether the standard covers all public facilitiesor certain federally funded projects only. The standard shall also be accompaniedby a description of local or State enforcement procedures. (c) <T3>State standards. </T3>For State-owned buildings, structures, or facilitiesoutside local jurisdictions, the responsible State agency adopts and enforcesapplicable standards. In some cases these may serve as a model for similaraction by local governments. As a condition for State approval of grantor loan assistance as the result of a major disaster or emergency, theGovernor's Authorized Representative may recommend to the Regional Directorthat the Associate Director prescribe certain standards for the FEMA-assistedproject for hazard mitigation purposes. The State HMC may also providetechnical advice and assistance on hazard mitigation measures to applicants,private organizations, and individuals. (d) <T3>Federal standards. </T3>(1) For Federally owned buildings, structures,or facilities outside local or State jurisdictions, the responsible Federalagency adopts and enforces applicable Federal standards. These may serveas models for local or State adoption and enforcement in similar circumstances.(2) The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) prescribes certain Federalstandards for repairs, alterations, and new construction within floodplainsas a condition for acceptance of a flood-prone community within the program.The Associate Director has prescribed as a standard, floodproofing measureswhich are appropriate as disaster proofing and practicable under E.O. 11988for facilities within the 100-year floodplain or for critical facilitieswithin the 500-year floodplain. For other types of disaster, similar standardsfor hazard mitigation may be available and appropriate for local, Stateand Federal use.(3) The FEMA/State survey team, and the planning team, shall be aware ofexisting standards and shall recommend appropriate examples to applicantsfor consideration as hazard mitigation related to the major disaster oremergency. (e) <T3>FEMA standards. </T3>Working with the State and applicants, throughthe survey team and the planning team, the Regional Directors shall encouragelocal adoption and enforcement on all projects, including nonfederallyassisted projects, of appropriate standards for hazard mitigation. Whena local or State government takes such action, the Regional Director mayrecommend that the Associate Director approve such standards as applicablefor FEMA-assisted projects, after appropriate consultations with FEMA,with local and State officials, and with appropriate elected officials,and with appropriate local governments. Based on these consultations andall available information, the Associate Director may approve such standardsas deviations applicable to FEMA assisted projects. When the local or Stategovernment declines to adopt and to enforce them for non-FEMA-assistedprojects, the Associate Director, after appropriate FEMA, State and localconsultations, may prescribe appropriate standards which are applicableonly to FEMA assisted projects. (Refer also to 44 CFR 206.402(d).) TheRegional Director may then approve FEMA grant or loan assistance to enablethe applicant to comply with them on FEMA assisted projects. The RegionalDirector may suspend or refuse to approve any project application untilhe/she is satisfied that the approved work will result in a facility orstructure safe and usable for the predisaster function, or for alternatefunctions proposed as flexible funding by the applicant in accordance withthese regulations. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.409 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Consultations. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>It is the intent of these regulations to provide opportunityfor State and local officials and interested individuals to participatein the hazard mitigation process. At various points in the process, consultationsand meetings with the FEMA/State survey team or planning team will provideinput from these sources as detailed in the following paragraphs. (b) <T3>Survey team. </T3>Members of the survey team shall make frequent contactsand have consultations with various applicants until the filed surveysare completed and appropriate hazard mitigation measures are recommended.The State HMC is responsible under the FEMA-State Agreement to arrangefor appropriate consultations and notices to inform the public on thosedecision making processes involved in the work of the survey team. An applicantor the FEMA HMC may request such arrangements when desired. (c) <T3>Planninq team. </T3>Similarly, members of the FEMA/State planning team,in coordination with the survey team, shall make contacts and have consultationswith various applicants or their planners as the planning team may requireto accomplish its assigned tasks. (d) <T3>Meetings. </T3>After the declaration of a major disaster or emergency,the Governor's Authorized Representative, in coordination with the RegionalDirector, schedules one or more meetings with local and State officialsrepresenting potential applicants for Federal assistance. These are generallyknown as ``Applicant's Briefings''. At these meetings FEMA and State staffmembers brief these local and State officials on FEMA policies and proceduresfor Federal grant or loan assistance under the Act. The Governor's AuthorizedRepresentative may arrange for the survey team and the planning team toparticipate in these briefings when desirable. The FEMA/State survey teamand the planning team will normally schedule followup meetings later todiscuss hazard mitigation measures with State and local officials. Whennecessary under FEMA's regulations pertaining to floodplain managementand environmental review (44 CFR Parts 9 and 10) early public notice maybe given of pending Federal actions. Based on the responses to such publicnotice, or when otherwise appropriate, the Regional Director may requestthe Governor's Authorized Representative to schedule public hearings forpurposes of consultation with interested parties on hazard mitigation measuresor problems. (e) <T3>Project management. </T3>Normal FEMA procedures for damage survey reports,project applications, final inspections, audits, and final payments requirelocal, State, and Federal contacts and coordination. Appeal proceduresprovide for further reviews and consultations of all interested partiesincluding the Associate Director and his/her staff. These procedures providedocumentation to support the hazard mitigation measures taken under section409 of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.410 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Compliance. </ITAG>(a) <T3>FEMA-State Agreement. </T3>Requirements for evidence of compliancemay vary for each major disaster or emergency depending on its nature,severity, and magnitude as well as on variations in the sources, capabilities,organization, and staffing of the local and State governments. Any specificrequirement for State evidence of compliance with hazard mitigation measuresmay be spelled out in the FEMA-State Agreement. (b) <T3>Plans. </T3>Review and acceptance of hazard mitigation plans submittedby the applicant or by the State in accordance with the FEMA-State Agreementprovides the Governor's Authorized Representative in coordination withthe Regional Director opportunities to schedule spot inspections, audits,and follow-up consultations. Through these activities, compliance withhazard mitigation objectives, schedules, and commitments may be verified.(c)<T3> Project administration.</T3> As a condition for approval of a projectapplication, and subsequently for approval of a voucher for final payment,the Governor's Authorized Representative and the Regional Director shallrequire documentation of required hazard mitigation measures, includingcompliance with applicable land use regulations or construction standards.In making Final Inspection Reports, Federal and State inspectors shallbe specifically asked to verify compliance by the applicant with approvedhazard mitigation standards. Similarly, auditors shall be required to verifysuch compliance in their audit reports. (d)<T3> Reporting.</T3> The Regional Director may specify in the FEMA-StateAgreement that the State provide reports of compliance with approved hazardmitigation plans or actions. The Governor's Authorized Representative mayalso require such progress reports from each applicant or he/she may submitone comprehensive report when scheduled. Prior to termination of the FEMA-StateAgreement, the Governor's Authorized Representative shall submit a finalreport of compliance with hazard mitigation requirements by State and localgovernments to the Regional Director for review and acceptance.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.411</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Evaluation. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Critiques.</T3> If requested by the Regional Director, the Governor'sAuthorized Representative shall arrange for a special critique of hazardmitigation plans and actions as the result of the major disaster or emergency.Each applicant shall be notified of the critique and may be invited toparticipate. As an alternative, a critique of hazard mitigation plans andactions may be scheduled to be covered at the FEMA/State critique coveringall disaster assistance activities as the result of the major disasteror emergency. (b) <T3>Final survey team report.</T3> Prior to terminating the survey teamactivities, the FEMA HMC and State HMC shall prepare a joint report oftheir activities and recommendations to the Governor's Authorized Representativeand to the Regional Director. (c) <T3>Final planning team report.</T3> Upon completion of its assigned mission,as discussed in 44 CFR 206.405, the FEMA/State planning team shall makea finaI report of its activities, findings and recommendations to the RegionalDirector through the Governor's Authorized Representative. This final reportshall specifically identify any remaining planning requirements for hazardmitigation as the result of the major disaster or emergency requiring Stateor FEMA followup. (d) <T3>Followup actions.</T3> The Regional Director shall review the reportsfrom the survey team and the planning team plus the report of compliancefrom the Governor's Authorized Representative. The Regional Director'sreport to the Associate Director shall focus on the positive results achievedthrough hazard mitigation plans and actions as the result of the majordisaster or emergency. He/she also shall provide in the report specificfindings and recommendations for Federal follow-up action which shouldbe taken after termination of the FEMA-State Agreement to provide mitigationof such hazards as the result of future disasters.
