Inside the jail, which was heavily guarded by barricades andhundreds of riot police, High Court prosecutor Chen Yao-nengquestioned the dissident, publisher Hsu Hsin-liang, about seditioncharges filed against him in connection with riots 10 years ago.   The demonstrators, mostly members of the oppositon DemocraticProgressive Party, waved banners and shouted ``Hsu Hsin-liang notguilty!'' They demanded he be released on bail. Several protestersset off firecrackers to celebrate Hsu's return.   The four-hour protest ended without incident.   Prosecutors have rejected a request by Hsu's lawyer, ChenShui-pien, that Hsu be freed on bond.   Hsu, 48, was arrested Wednesday after coast guard officialsfound him hiding in a fishing boat off the southern Taiwanese portof Kaohsiung as he was attempting to sneak back into the country.   He had tried three other times since 1979 to return to Taiwanbut was turned back when airliners observed a Taiwan governmentdemand he not be allowed to board Taiwan-bound flights. Governmentofficials feared Hsu's return would trigger political unrest.   Military prosecutors in 1980 filed sedition charges against Hsufor his alleged involvement in anti-government riots in Kaohsiungin 1979.   The riots broke out two months after Hsu left for the UnitedStates, but authorities said he helped organized them.   Military authorities also accused Hsu of advocatinganti-government movements that support an independent Taiwan.   The Nationalist government, which fled to Taiwan after losing acivil war to Communist forces in 1949 on the Chinese mainland,still claims to be the ruler of all China and opposes anindependent state of Taiwan.   Hsu has denied the charges against him.</TEXT></DOC>
