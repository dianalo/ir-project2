Li's report to the 2,970 delegates of China's legislature alsosaid that in the next five years, China will maintain its policiesof market-oriented reforms, opening itself to the outside world andmaking its political system more democratic.   Li, 59, is expected to be confirmed as head of government at thelegislative session, which will last 20 days. With his report, Lidisplayed his full support, at least publicly, for the reforms setin motion by his protege, senior leader Deng Xiaoping.   In the next five years, Li said, China must ``put reform at thecenter of all our undertakings and integrate it more closely witheconomic development so that the two are coordinated and promoteeach other.''   Veteran military leader Yang Shangkun, 81, an ally of Deng, islikely to replace Li Xiannian, 79, in the largely ceremonial postof president.   Deng, 83, who entered semi-retirement last fall at a majorCommunist Party meeting, sat on the podium between Li and ZhaoZiyang, the former premier who now heads the Communist Party.   The delegates also are expected to pass laws giving greaterauthority to factory managers.   Li, a Soviet-trained technocrat regarded as being cautioustoward reforms, also sounded several conservative themes oneconomic problems in his speech, the keynote address of thecongress.   Among those problems, he said, are rising prices, ``theoutstanding problem in our economic and social life today,''inadequate investment on agriculture, and economic crimes committedby those seeking personal gains.   In the past five years, reforms have brought China an annualgrowth rate of 11.1 percent, provided jobs for 37 million people,substantially raised living standards and opened China to foreigninvestment and trade, he said.   Li outlined 10 objectives for the next five years, led by theneed for further reforms in agriculture. Chinese leaders have beenconcerned about stagnating grain production as farmers switch tomore lucrative cash crops, and Li stressed that more money andeffort must be spent to ``mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm foragricultural production.''   Li also stressed that China must revitalize its enterprises byinstituting contract systems for managers and reducing governmentinterference in factories. Heading the legislation to be passed atthe congress is an industrial enterprise law to guarantee therights of managers to operate their factories without interference.   He hit hard on the problem of rising prices and said inflationmust be fought by reforming the irrational, heavily subsidizedpricing system and expanding supplies while controlling some prices.   Officially, inflation was 7.3 percent last year, but prices inmost larger cities rose at double-digit rates.   Li mentioned March 5 anti-Chinese riots in the Tibetan capitalof Lhasa, saying the Buddhist monk-led demonstrators ``violated thelaw and undermined the unity of the motherland. The rioters must beseverely punished.''   Congress officials have promised that the session will be themost open ever, with foreign journalists allowed to attend some ofthe legislature's discussion groups as well as the opening andclosing sessions.   Access to the discussions is part of the government attempt toshow the outside world that the congress, long belittled as arubber-stamp body for policies set by the party, has become moredemocratic and influential.   All major decisions are still made by the party Politburo andits standing committee, but under outgoing congress chairman PengZhen, 86, the body has gained some stature as a forum to debate,and sometimes revise, policies handed down by the party.</TEXT></DOC>
