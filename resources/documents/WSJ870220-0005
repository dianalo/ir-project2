Mr. Reagan also named Frank Donatelli, a longtime Reagan political supporter and partner at the Washington law firm of Patton, Boggs andamp; Blow, as White House political director. The 37-year-old Mr. Donatelli, who served as President Reagan's public-liaison chief from 1984 to 1985, succeeds Mitchell Daniels.    Messrs. Buchanan and Daniels recently announced their departures in order to enter the private sector. Both jobs will change hands March 2.    Shortly after Mr. Koehler's appointment was announced yesterday, a controversy arose about his participation in a Nazi youth group as a youngster growing up in Germany. &quot;Sure it was a forerunner to the Hitler youth. I just got bored with it and got out,&quot; Mr. Koehler said in an interview. He said he was in the Jungvolk group for only about six months when he was 10 years old.    &quot;When it first started it was great, had uniforms, you marched around and so forth,&quot; he said. He said he quit when he found the marching too boring and because he preferred &quot;to go out and collect rocks.&quot; Mr. Koehler said he's not worried that this will sidetrack his new job since, he said, he isn't a Nazi sympathizer and he's been married twice to Jewish women, including his current wife. The White House had no comment.    The 56-year-old Mr. Koehler, who retired from the AP two years ago and heads his own international public-affairs consulting firm, has been working as a consultant to Charles Wick, director of the United States Information Agency. Mr. Wick, a longtime friend of the president's, backed Mr. Koehler for the post, which oversees presidential speechwriting.    Mr. Donatelli worked as a regional political director for Mr. Reagan's primary and general presidential campaigns in 1979 and 1980, and before that he worked on Treasury Secretary James Baker's unsuccessful campaign for Texas attorney general in 1978.    The White House also said that Ronald Cass, a 37-year-old Boston University Law School professor, was named to fill a vacancy on the U.S. International Trade Commission. The nomination requires Senate approval. Mr. Cass would succeed Paul Stern, who resigned from the six-member trade panel in January. </TEXT></DOC>
