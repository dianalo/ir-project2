The National Wildlife Federation and other conservation groupsargue that the Commerce Department must uphold the law requiringshrimpers to equip their nets with turtle excluder devices, andthat limited trawling is ineffective in protecting sea turtles suchas the Kemp's ridley.   Under a rule that took effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT today, shrimperswere to begin pulling their nets every 105 minutes to check forentangled sea turtles.   Mosbacher predicted compliance with the limiting trawling timeswould be far better than with the turtle excluder devices thatshrimpers loathe. But conservationists said only TEDs can save theKemp's ridley from extinction before the end of the century.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Caution Urged in Sri Lankan Travel</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The State Department has warned Americans toavoid unnecessary travel in Sri Lanka because of political tensionand the widespread potential for violence.
