Carlucci said it is too early to specify a date for a halt inthe 1-year-old administration policy of protecting the reflaggedKuwaiti tankers from Iranian attacks.   ``It's a little hard to make that kind of judgment at thispoint,'' Carlucci said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' when asked abouta date for ending the escorts.   ``We want to watch the negotiations. We'd probably want to takesome reasonable interval to make certain that the ceasefireholds,'' he said. ``But there's no desire to keep 27 ships thereany longer than possible.''   Carlucci noted that Navy ships will remain in the gulf, as theyhave for 40 years, but said ``we would certainly draw down (thenumber of U.S. ships) as soon as feasible.'' Until the reflaggingpolicy began, the Navy had only five or six ships in the waterway.   Iran last week agreed to accept the terms of United Nationsresolution 598, which proposes a ceasefire as the first major steptoward a negotiated peace. That raised hopes that the bloody8-year-old conflict would soon end.   But as representatives of both countries prepare to meet thisweek at the United Nations, Iraq has launched a series of attacksinto Iran.   Carlucci and John Whitehead, the deputy secretary of state, bothsaid Reagan administration policies deserve credit for influencingIran's decision to accept the resolution.   ``The fact that we have been resolute, that we have stood by ourfriends, that we have stood by the principles of freedom ofnavigation and that he (Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini)has not been able to drive us from the gulf has had a significantimpact on Iranian thinking,'' Carlucci said.   ``Furthermore, our staunchness in this area has helped toisolate Iran in the world community,'' Carlucci said. ``We havebeen quite successful in preventing our countries from shippingarms to Iran, so gradually Iran came to the realization that theirpolicies were not succeeding, that they were not going to drive usout of the area.''   Whitehead, appearing on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley,''said, ``this is a time if not for bragging, at least it's a time, Ithink, for all of us to be proud that our policy has been asuccess.''   ``Certainly Iran's decision is not solely attributable to U.S.policy,'' he said, ``but our firmness of our military presence inthe gulf, our indication that we planned to stay there as long asit was necessary, and at the same time our diplomatic track,principally at the United Nations, has finally achieved success.''   Both men also said an end to the war could eventually lead toimproved U.S.-Iran relations and the possible release of Americanhostages held in Lebanon by Iranian-backed groups.   Carlucci said he didn't know about any ``specific message'' fromIran seeking improved relations, but added, ``We have consistentlysaid that we're prepared to enter into a dialogue with Iran, allthey have to do is designate somebody who is officially empoweredto talk to us and we'd be glad to talk with them about policyissues, about terrorism, about bringing peace to the region, aboutwhatever is appropriate.   ``If they want to talk about policy issues, hostages, terrorism... we'd be pleased to do that,'' he said.   Asked specifically about reports the U.S. hostages might bereleased, Carlucci said, ``We're obviously not going to discuss anyquid pro quo (with Iran), but if the Iranians want to talk to usabout the hostage situation and how they're going to go aboutinfluencing their release, we'd be delighted to talk to them aboutit.''   Nine Americans are being held hostage in Lebanon.   ``I'm not in the slightest suggesting that there would be anydeal for the hostages. That is contrary to our policy,'' he said.   As President Reagan boarded Air Force One to return toWashington from California, he was asked whether the United Stateswas ready for talks about the hostages.   He appeared not to hear the question and did not respond.   Later, aboard the plane, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwatersaid the hostage situation is easy to solve.   ``All they have to do is release them,'' he said.   ``They don't need negotiations to release the hostages. We arewilling to talk to anybody any place but we are not willing tonegotiate. We are not willing to pay ransom. There is no need. Theytook them they should release them. As far as we are concernednothing has changed in regard to the hostages,'' said Fitzwater.</TEXT></DOC>
