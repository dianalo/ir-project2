Panamanian pilot Eduardo Pardo has cooperated with the U.S.attorney's office in its investigation of the deposed Panamanianleader, and will continue to do so, his attorney told U.S. DistrictJudge William Hoeveler.   Pardo, 44, pleaded guilty in February to one count of illegaltravel for flying $800,000 in cocaine profits from Florida toPanama in 1983.   Pardo had faced a maximum five-year federal prison sentence anda $10,000 fine.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan recommended leniencyfor Pardo. He said the defendant had turned over evidence thathelped investigators track the movements of other co-defendants,including his flight log.   ``We intend to talk to him more,'' Sullivan said.   Tears ran down Pardo's face as his attorney, William Meadows,pleaded for probation. Pardo declined an opportunity to speak onhis own behalf.   He pleaded guilty ``because he knew that he did somethingwrong,'' Meadows said. ``He was deeply remorseful for it, and hesaid he has not done anything similar before or since.''   Meadows noted that Pardo had no previous criminal record andsurrendered voluntarily to U.S. authorities in Panama Cityfollowing the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama.   Under sentencing guidelines, Pardo would be freed in 20 months,including five already served. But Hoeveler made a point of tellingMeadows he would welcome a motion to reduce the sentence if Pardocontinued cooperating with investigators.   Outside the courtroom, Samuel Burstyn, attorney for co-defendantLuis del Cid, said the sentence would keep Pardo in the UnitedStates until after the Noriega trial planned for early next year.   Burstyn said the sentence was ``obviously'' aimed at keepingPardo available to the government.   The attorney also revealed that his client, who'd beennegotiating a plea bargain, has run into difficulties becausePanamanian authorities have said they will not necessarily acceptany agreement he makes with U.S. prosecutors.   The attorney said he could not reach an agreement with federalprosecutors ``only to have the Panamanians in their zeal seek toextradite him.''   Del Cid, a former top aide to Noriega, is considered thehighest-ranking defendant in custody after the former Panamanianleader himself.   Noriega, del Cid and Pardo are among 16 people indicted in Miamiin February 1988 on charges of taking part in a conspiracy thatmade Panama a way station and processing center for Colombia'sMedellin drug cartel.   Pardo and co-defendant Daniel Miranda flew a Lear jet fittedwith secret compartments to hide the money, Sullivan told the courtin February.   Pardo received $40,000 for the flight and knew it was drugmoney, the prosecutor said.   If Pardo testifies for the prosecution, the defendant mostimmediately threatened by Pardo would appear to be Miranda.   Miranda's attorney, Michael O'Kane, has said his client didn'tknow the money came from drugs, and that Pardo's guilty plea didn'tnecessarily implicate his client.   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from thecartel. The Panamanian leader surrendered to U.S. troops after theinvasion of his country.   He and three of the other defendants are being held in theMetropolitan Correctional Center south of Miami. Miranda and BrianAlden Davidow are out on bond.</TEXT></DOC>
