The 25 world income funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. surged 10.73% in the quarter. For all of 1987, the group, which invests in overseas bonds, shot up 20.8%, the third biggest gain of any mutual fund sector. Foreign bond funds did well in 1986, too.    Much of 1987's gains, however, stemmed from the drastic drop in the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the currency's rebound last week cut some funds' net asset values. Even if the dollar resumes its fall, some fund managers say the group's heady growth is nearing an end.    &quot;The spectacular gains are over; they're impossible to sustain,&quot; Thomas Prapas, chief economist for Clemente Capital Inc., New York, and co-manager of the Freedom Global Income Plus Fund, says.    A cautious note also is sounded by James Hocking, manager of the Templeton Income Fund. &quot;Returns in '87 were based on currency movements; '88 will be based more on interest rates,&quot; he says.    Foreign bond funds still should be attractive this year, mutual fund managers say. Many bond specialists expect interest rates to continue to fall for much of 1988 both in the U.S. and abroad, boosting the funds' returns. And despite last week's dollar upturn, many analysts expect a further eroding of the currency's value against most other major currencies throughout the year.    Nonetheless, new investors should be aware of potential volatility, the bond specialists say, particularly with the increased uncertainty that surrounds all markets this year. In addition, many of the funds are new; only eight existed before last year, and the group as a whole wasn't tracked by Lipper Analytical. This means some fund managers may be relatively untested at sizing up and reacting to big shifts in the credit and currency markets.    The obvious pitfall for all bond funds is rising interest rates, which would cut bond prices and hurt the principal value of a portfolio. But with foreign bond funds, risks can be greater because of the chance that currency movements also will take a chunk off the value.    To counter this, fund managers try to spread the risk around, investing in credit markets of several countries. Some funds sometimes hedge their holdings by selling currencies in the forward market to lock in the prevailing exchange rates.    For much of 1987, many bond funds made gains in Australia and New Zealand, where both the currencies and the bond markets were rallying. Currently, many managers see good bond-market bets in West Germany and Britain. The Merrill Lynch Retirement Global Bond Fund, for instance, which posted the group's second best return last year, has 20% of its portfolio invested in West Germany.    Even though the West German mark has risen a long way against the dollar, &quot;it could move a little bit further,&quot; David Walter, Merrill's portfolio manager, says. And with inflationary expectations low in West Germany, he says, &quot;the bond market could finally have a really good move.&quot;    The T. Rowe Price International Bond Fund, last year's performance leader, has gained since October by stretching out the maturities of its holdings. Longer-maturity issues typically are more responsive to interest-rate changes, and rates have fallen since the October stock market crash.    David Boardman, portfolio adviser, says the fund also has been &quot;very active&quot; in the forward markets to hedge against currency movements.    Some world income funds play both the bond and the stock markets. One laggard, the Templeton Income Fund, was hurt because one-third of its portfolio is in highyield foreign stocks, such as financial services companies, which performed poorly during the crash.    And at least one successful fund, Freedom Global Income Plus, hedges with positions in foreign convertible bonds and highquality equity warrants. The fund also has increased its position in U.S. bonds, betting that the dollar will continue to rebound. Those bonds, which the fund had avoided until after last August, now account for nearly half the portfolio.    &quot;We intend to hold them (U.S. bonds) until the dollar strengthens and U.S. rates begin to come down&quot; before reinvesting in European bonds, Mr. Prapas, the fund co-manager, says.    No matter what the strategy, Mr. Prapas says, the murky market picture this year will make gains harder to attain.    &quot;You'll have to be very nimble to do well,&quot; he says.
