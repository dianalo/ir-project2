Union president Henry Duffy said theaction would slow air traffic, but insisted that was not the intent.   In some cities bad weather delayed or canceled flights, and inothers there was little early indication of a slowdown.</TEXT><NOTE>BUSH</NOTE><TEXT>   President Bush said pilots should not ``make the innocenttraveling public a pawn in this dispute,'' and stood by hisopposition to government intervention to stop the walkout.   He also warned striking machinists that he will seek legislationto forbid secondary boycotts if they picket other transportationsystems.</TEXT><NOTE>CONGRESS</NOTE><TEXT>   The House Public Works Committee's aviation subcommittee isconsidering a bill that would direct Bush to set up an emergencypanel to study issues in the strike. If enacted, the bill would stopthe strike for at least 60 days while the panel investigates issueson both sides. Bush refused to take that action Friday before thestrike.   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner appealed to Congress notto force Bush to create the panel, saying the economic realitiesshould dictate the outcome and the Eastern strike alone ``does notsubstantially disrupt this nation's transportation system.''   Rep. James Oberstar, the subcommittee chairman, suggested thatthe emergency panel legislation ``might give cover to theadministration'' for the action Bush refused to take. Oberstaragreed the strike was not an ``emergency'' but called it part of ``along-term problem with broad implications for the airline industry.''</TEXT><NOTE>EASTERN OPERATIONS</NOTE><TEXT>   Eastern virtually shut down and furloughed more than 5,000non-union workers Monday and is continuing service only its mostprofitable routes _ its shuttle between Washington, New York andBoston, and three round trips weekly between Miami, Buenos Aires,Argentina, and Santiago, Chile.   Full-page advertisements for Eastern in The New York Times, TheWashington Post and The Boston Globe urged ``Fly Us With NoReservations'' and promised that the shuttle is operating every hour.</TEXT><NOTE>NEGOTIATIONS</NOTE><TEXT>   None scheduled. The last talks were Friday; they failed toproduce an agreement.</TEXT><NOTE>RAILROADS</NOTE><TEXT>   U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson issued a temporaryrestraining order Monday against secondary picketing at Amtrak.   The judge on Sunday issued a similar order against three majorrail lines that carry commuters between New York City and NewJersey, Long Island and northern suburbs.   Nine other commuter railroads nationwide and Amtrak had beenpotential targets of sympathy actions. But the Machinists union saidit decided to appeal Patterson's orders and did not set up picketlines at railroads Monday. A hearing on both rulings is scheduledfor Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
