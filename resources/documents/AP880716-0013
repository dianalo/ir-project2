(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 5,000 hunters met Friday'sdeadline to apply for just 235 licenses in Florida's firstalligator hunt in 25 years. The lucky winners won't be allowed touse guns.   Once an endangered species, the American alligator now numbersabout 1 million in Florida and is increasingly encountering humansas the state's people population also grows.   A 4-year-old girl was killed by an alligator in May near herfamily's lakeside home in Englewood, in southwest Florida, butplanning for the hunt had been under way long before that.   The Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission gave final approvalFriday, during a meeting in Ocala, for the trapping and killing ofup to 3,425 alligators in 20 wildlife management areas during the30-day hunt this fall. That quote assumes that not every hunterwill get his full 15-animal limit.   Commission spokesman Scott Ball said 15,000 applications wereprinted and he was surprised that only 5,000 people applied.   ``A lot of people have been calling up in the last few days thathave been procrastinating and kicking themselves for waiting untilthe last minute,'' said Ball. ``They are asking about next year.''   The sanctioned hunts will occur only at night and trappers willhave to use snares, harpoons, spears or similar weapons to get agator close enough to kill. The only firearm allowed will be a``bangstick,'' a pole with a shotgun shell on the end that is usedto kill a gator once it is snared and brought up to a boat, saidBall.   Part of the motivation for hunting gators may be economic. Gatormeat sells for about $5 a pound; hide sells for about $40 a foot.   Florida residents selected by lottery for the hunt will have topay a $250 license fee, plus a $30 tag fee for each gator theycatch up. Out-of-state hunters will have to pay $1,000 for thelicenses.   In addition to the license fees and tag fees, those awardedlicenses will have to go through a six-hour training course inearly August, said Ball.   The targeted reptiles will have to be at least 4 feet long.   The tag fee is to pay for inspection and verification that hidesbeing prepared for market are legal.   ``It's tightly regulated so that only legal hides will bebrought to marketplace,'' said Ball. ``There are only a fewprocessors of hides. We keep an eye on them.''   Since the mid-1960s, alligator hunting virtually has been bannedexcept for isolated experimental hunts since 1982 and the removalof nuisance alligators in populated areas.</TEXT></DOC>
