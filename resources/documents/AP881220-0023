Almost half the penalties would be accounted for by one plant,Inland Steel Co.'s works at East Chicago, Ind., which was accused bythe Environmental Protection Agency of not reporting emissions of 33different substances ranging from aluminum to xylene.   Inland's proposed fine was set at $721,000. Spokesman Bob Lefleysaid Monday, ``We reported, except we reported late,'' after theJuly 1 deadline.   ``Since this is the country's second-largest steel plant, it wasa monumental task.'' Lefley declined further comment.   The law requiring reports of emissions was passed in 1986 inresponse to the Bhopal disaster in India two years earlier in whichmore than 2,000 people were killed by escaping methyl isocyanate, agas used in making pesticides.   Companies in a broad swath of industrial categories are required,among other things, to report releases to air, water and land of 320hazardous or toxic chemicals or chemical families. EPA forms weresupposed to have been filled out and filed with both EPA and stateauthorities.   All 25 plants proposed for fines were checked by inspectors fromEPA's regional offices, and penalties were chosen to reflect thesize of the company, the number of chemicals that should have beenreported, the quantities released and the amount being used, EPAsaid.   ``We're not talking about a major enforcement action here,'' saidBill Walsh of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, an advocacyorganization that has kept track of developments in the field.``There are 15,000 to 16,000 companies that EPA knows of that havenot filled out the forms out of 30,000'' that were obliged to.   EPA spokeswoman Alicia Tenuta said she could not confirm Walsh'sfigures. However, she said investigators were finding that ofcompanies they looked at, roughly one-third had not complied fullywith the reporting requirements.   EPA could have imposed fines of $25,000 per day. The companieshave 20 days to notify EPA whether they want to pay the fine, to tryto negotiate a lower fine or to contest the fine before anadministrative law judge.   Here are the companies and locations of the affected plants,along with the plant's principal product or line of business, thechemicals whose emissions should have been reported and the fines.The agency did not say how much of each chemical was involved.</TEXT><BYLINE>ALABAMA</BYLINE><TEXT>   The Glamourtop Corp., Birmingham, wood counter tops; toluene,acetone, $34,000.</TEXT><BYLINE>ARKANSAS</BYLINE><TEXT>   Riverside Furniture Corp., Fort Smith, furniture; methyl isobutylketone, xylene, toluene, methanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone,$126,000.</TEXT><BYLINE>CALIFORNIA</BYLINE><TEXT>   United States Can Co., San Leandro, cans; lead comppunds, glycolether compounds, $34,000.</TEXT><BYLINE>GEORGIA</BYLINE><TEXT>   Bio-Lab Inc., Conyers, swimming pool chemicals; phosphoric acid,copper sulfate, $34,000.</TEXT><BYLINE>INDIANA</BYLINE><TEXT>   Inland Steel Co., East Chicago, steel; aluminum, aluminum oxide,ammonia, ammonium sulfate, anthracene, benzene, biphenyl, chlorine,chromium, copper, dibenzofuran, diethanolamine, ethylbenzene,ethylene, ethylene glycol, hydrochloric acid, lead, manganese,naphthalene, nickel, tetrachloroethylene, phenol, phosphoric acid,phosphorous, propylene, quinoline, sodium hydroxide, styrene,sulfuric acid, toluene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, vanadium, xylene,$721,000.</TEXT><BYLINE>LOUISIANA</BYLINE><TEXT>   Colonial Sugars Inc., Gramercy, sugar; phosphoric acid, chlorine,$42,000.
