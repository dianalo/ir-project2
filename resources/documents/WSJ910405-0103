Curragh is the Western world's sixth largest producer ofzinc and lead concentrates, accounting last year for 3% ofthe West's newly mined zinc and 5% of its lead. The strikewould close its only mine currently in operation.</LP><TEXT>   Zinc and lead prices have slumped in recent months,averaging 52 cents (U.S.) a pound for zinc and 26 cents apound for lead so far this year, compared with an average for1990 of 69 cents and 36 cents, respectively.   Julian Baldry, senior mining analyst at Nesbitt ThomsonDeacon Inc., said a lengthy strike would put upward pressureon market prices for zinc and lead. He said a price recoverycould be further driven by a shortage of metal concentratesthat is expected to emerge this spring as a result of strikesand operating problems at other mines. A New Brunswick zincmine, owned by a subsidiary of Noranda Inc., Toronto, hasbeen operating at about 25% of capacity since last Julybecause of a strike.   &quot;I'm not too optimistic that we won't have some kind of astrike&quot; at the Faro mine, said Clifford Frame, Curragh'schairman, president and chief executive officer. He said astrike would result in lower output and higher operatingcosts for Curragh in 1991.   A strike is &quot;almost certain,&quot; said Stephen Arkley, amember of the bargaining committee for Local 1051 of theUnited Steelworkers of America. He said the two sides werestill &quot;quite far apart&quot; on wages when talks broke down thisweek.   Faro mine workers received a base wage of 12.78 Canadiandollars (US$11.06) an hour under the contract that expiredlast Oct. 31. The union is seeking an additional C$3.50 anhour over two years; the company has offered an increase ofC$2.40 an hour over three years, another union official said.He said the union also wants improvements in benefits andhealth and safety measures.</TEXT></DOC>
