Asset-backed securities are among the newer products tohit the fixed-income market in recent years. They includesecurities backed by credit-card receivables, automobileloans, and home-equity and mobile-home loans.</LP><TEXT>   Although the Moody's report focused only on credit-cardsecurities, the findings in the report spell trouble for alltypes of securities that are backed by consumer credit.   Moody's said that in the past few months, credit-cardcharge-offs and delinquencies have been &quot;considerably higher&quot;than a year ago. In addition, Moody's said that payment rates-- the portion of the credit-card debt that consumers payback each month -- have slowed, another indication thathouseholds are having increasing difficulty making theirmonthly debt payments.   Moody's said its index of charge-offs for credit-cardsecurities issued by three major issuers -- Citibank, FirstChicago Bank and Maryland National Bank -- rose to 4.43% inNovember 1990 from 3.45% in November 1989. Moody's said thatdelinquencies rose to 5.73% from 4.66% and the payment ratefell to 10.51% from 12.11%.   Claire Robinson, a Moody's analyst, said the credit ratingagency currently has no plans to downgrade the rating on anyof the $30 billion of credit-card securities outstanding.However, she said, rising chargeoffs could soon trigger earlyprepayment events and cause the securities to be retiredearly. If such events were to occur, investors would not loseprincipal, but would be faced with the task of reinvesting,possibly at a lower interest rate.   Traders yesterday said that yields on some credit-cardsecurities issued by Citicorp were yielding 8.70% to 8.80%,about 1.15 percentage points higher than the yield onthree-year Treasury notes. A few months ago, Citicorpcredit-card securities had yields that were 0.65 to 0.70percentage points higher than three-year Treasury securities.   &quot;Investors fear the unknown,&quot; said a trader in New York.&quot;Credit-card securities have only been in existence for ashort time and no one knows how they will perform&quot; during arecession, he said.   In bond market trading yesterday, prices of mostfixed-income securities ended little changed in quiettrading. The major exception to that trend was the debt ofCiticorp, which plunged yesterday in reaction to Friday'slate news that Moody's downgraded the banking concern's debtrating.   Moody's lowered the ratings on Citicorp's subordinateddebt to Baa-3, the lowest possible investment-grade ratingand just a notch away from &quot;junk bond&quot; status. Citicorp'ssenior debt rating was downgraded to Baa-2 from single-A-3while the rating on the bank's commercial paper declined toprime-3 from prime-2.   Citicorp 9.75% subordinated capital notes, due in 1999,plunged three points to 85 3/8 for a yield of 12.60%. Thebonds, which are considered a bellwether Citicorp issue,traded at a yield of 11.95% Friday.   Anne McDermott, a banking analyst at Kidder Peabody andamp; Co.,said investors were taken aback by the scope of the downgradeand its timing. &quot;It was a two-notch downgrade,&quot; she said. &quot;Inlight of the relatively positive reaction to the analystsmeeting last week, it was a surprise.&quot;   Ms. McDermott said the downgrade of Citicorp's preferredstock to Ba-1, or speculative-grade status, is particularlyworrisome because it might impede the company's ability toraise capital through the private placement of preferredstock. It had been rumored for some time that the bankingconcern is seeking to raise $1 billion or more of capitalthrough the issuance of convertible preferred stock.   The market's reaction to Citicorp debt also raised thepossibility that the banking concern may redeem some of itspreferred-stock on which the dividend rate is to be resetwithin the next week. Rates on an undisclosed amount ofCiticorp remarketed preferred stock are to be reset Friday byMerrill Lynch; the rate on a $75 million Citicorp auctionrate preferred issue is to be reset in an auction Mondayconducted by Goldman Sachs. The $75 million issue isconsidered to be the most likely candidate for Citicorp tobuy back, analysts said. Citicorp declined to comment.   Yesterday, Citicorp's adjustable rate Series 2 preferredstock slid 3 1/2 points to 56 1/2.   Meanwhile, BankAmerica Corp., which is rated single-A,issued $100 million of subordinated notes yesterday. The12-year notes were priced to yield 10.022%, a spread of 1.97percentage points above the yield on 10-year Treasury notes.   While that spread is much narrower than the spread onCiticorp debt, it is still much wider than what BankAmericahad to pay in previous visits to the credit markets. Lastsummer, BankAmerica sold two 10-year subordinated noteofferings that were priced at a spread of 1.30 percentagepoints above the comparable Treasury securities.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasury prices ended narrowly mixed in light trading.   Traders said that investors appear reluctant toparticipate in the market ahead of two potentiallymarket-moving events -- tomorrow's announcement about thequarterly refunding of the federal debt and Friday's Januaryemployment report.   Meanwhile, the absence of any significant news from theGulf war front and the uncertain outcome of the events in theSoviet Union also are preventing investors from charging backinto the market.   In trading yesterday, the Treasury's benchmark 30-yearbond was quoted late at a price of 105 25/32, up 2/32 fromlate Friday, to yield 8.22%.   Short-term securities posted small losses. The latesttwo-year notes ended at a price of 99 25/32, down 1/32 toyield about 7.10%.   Meanwhile, small investors purchased fewer Treasury billsat the government's weekly auction yesterday even thoughyields were higher than at the previous auction.   The Treasury sold $20 billion of three-month and six-monthbills. The average discount rate on the three-month bills was6.22% and the average rate on the six-month bills was 6.28%.Those rates were up from last week's auction when they were6.14% and 6.21%, respectively.   The amount of noncompetitive bids for the three-monthbills at yesterday's sale was $1.34 billion, down from $1.74billion at last week's auction.   Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                                                                                                                      13-Week          26-Week                                                                                                          Applications ........... $29,411,605,000  $29,924,825,000   Accepted bids .......... $10,006,425,000  $10,029,655,000   Accepted at low price ..             96%              35%   Accepted noncompet'ly ..  $1,344,725,000   $1,346,640,000   Average price (Rate) ...  98.428 (6.22%)   96.825 (6.28%)   High price (Rate) ......  98.433 (6.20%)   96.835 (6.26%)   Low price (Rate) .......  98.428 (6.22%)   96.825 (6.28%)                                                                                                          Both issues are dated Jan. 31, 1991. The 13-week billsmature May 2, 1991, and the 26-week bills mature Aug. 1,1991.                                                                                                          Corporate Bonds                                                                                                          There was little reaction in the junk bond marketyesterday to news that the Resolution Trust Corp. will delayor possibly scrap a nearly $500 million collateralized bondobligation.   CBOs are securities that are formed by packaging a largegroup of junk bonds into a pool. The CBO gets aninvestment-grade credit rating because the pool of securitiesthat makes up the CBO is overcollateralized and highlydiversified.   A spokeswoman for the RTC said issuance of its CBO, whichhas been in the works for months, has been delayed whiledirectors of the agency seek indemnification from Congressagainst potential legal liability that could arise if thesecurities fail to perform as potential buyers expect.   &quot;Right now it's been put on hold,&quot; said the spokeswoman.But she added, &quot;if there is some type of legislation passedthat would clear certain RTC directors from liability, itcould be started up again.&quot;   The RTC, a federal agency created to handle the thriftindustry bailout, holds nearly $7 billion of junk bonds. Thattotal includes nearly $4 billion of junk bonds the RTCinherited late last week when the government seized controlof Columbia Savings andamp; Loan Association in Beverly Hills,Calif.   In trading yesterday, most junk bonds finished 1/4 pointhigher.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          There was little initial reaction to news that Standard andamp;Poor's Corp. placed the Triple-A general obligation bondrating of California on its CreditWatch surveillance listwith negative implications.   Meanwhile, municipal bonds were little changed in quietdealings.   Sandamp;P cited a &quot;rapidly developing deficit projected forfiscal 1991 and 1992&quot; and slowing economic growth in takingthe ratings action regarding California.   Approximately $11.6 billion of the state's generalobligation debt is affected. Also listed on the CreditWatchare the ratings on $3 billion of debt of state agencies,whose ratings are guaranteed or supported by stateappropriations.   Traders reported that bond prices were not hurt by theratings action. &quot;I think it's a little too early to tell. Ithink it has to be digested,&quot; said Peck Ferrin, vicepresident and manager of municipal trading and underwritingat Bank of America.   Currently California is one of only nine states ratedTriple-A by Sandamp;P. The others are Maine, Maryland, Missouri,New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah andVirginia.   Within the next few weeks California is expected to cometo market with about $1 billion in general obligation debt.Yields offered on those bonds will be a more tellingindication of the market's reaction to the CreditWatch thancurrent secondary market dealings, says a bond trader.   In new issue dealings, a Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. grouprepriced an issue of $113 million Louisiana Energy and PowerAuthority power project revenue bonds to lower some yields bythree to 10 basis points.   The bonds, FGIC-insured and rated triple-A/triple-A, arenow priced to yield from 5.65% in 1992 to 7.05% in 2008,changed from 5.75% in 1992 to 7.08% in 2008.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage securities were unchanged to minimally higher ina quiet session.   Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities forFebruary delivery were up 2/32 at 99 26/32, Federal Home LoanMortgage Corp. Gold 9% securities were unchanged at 99 3/8and Federal National Mortgage Association 9% Securities wereflat at 99 5/32.   Lehman Brothers announced a $500 million Freddie Macfunding note pass-through issue, the first mortgage-backedsecurities tied to a corporate bond index.   The offering is based on the Lehman Brothers CorporateBond Index, which is considered a benchmark for measuringcorporate bond portfolio performance.   The securities -- called TRAINs, for Total ReturnAdjustable Index Notes, and I-TRAINs, for Inverse-TotalReturn Adjustable Index Notes -- are backed by 8 1/2% FreddieMac Gold Giant participation certificates.   The coupon rate on the TRAINs is based on the CBI'squarterly total return. The coupon rate on the I-TRAINs willreflect the inverse of the CBI's quarterly change.   TRAINs and I-TRAINs can be recombined on a one-for-onebasis and exchanged for an equal amount of 8 1/2 Freddie MacGiant Gold PCs.   Two new Freddie Mac real estate mortgage investmentconduit offerings also were announced. Freddie Mac Remicseries 1048, a $500 million offering backed by 9 1/2% GoldFreddie Mac participation certificates, is being offeredthrough Bear Stearns andamp; Co.
