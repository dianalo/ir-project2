I don't reallythink they speak the same language, but.andP;  .  .&quot;andM;Good news! You can use information from a DBASE file in a WordPerfect 5.1 or5.0 merge.andP;  First, you have to tell DBASE to create an ASCII file thatseparates each field.andP;  Tell WordPerfect to convert that ASCII file to asecondary merge file using commas and quotation marks as delimiters, andthat's it.andM;Stay calm.andP;  You can get this done without learning a foreign language.andP;  Let'sstart at the beginning.andP;  First of all, this article is about gettinginformation from DBASE into a format WordPerfect can use.andP;  It's not aboutmerging.andP;  Bu% since if s easier to understand how to do something if you knowwhy you're doing it, here's a little basic info.andP;  What's a WordPerfect merge?andM;A merge is simply a way to combine information that changes (names andaddresses) with information that doesn't change (the letter).andP;  Theinformation that doesn't change is entered into a  primary&quot; file.andP;  Inaddition to the text of the letter-which you'll type in WordPerfect-you mustalso insert merge codes into the primary file.andP;  (Consult your manual for moreinformation about creating a primary.)andM;Client names and addresses are entered into a &quot;secondary&quot; file, which isorganized into fields and records.andP;  A field is a single item of information,such as a last name.andP;  A record is one complete set of variable informationsuch as last name, first name, address, city, state and ZIP code!.andP;  During amerge, this information is placed, via merge codes, into the primary file.andM;Figure 1 is a sample list of names and addresses.andP;  In this example, &quot;Ima&quot;represents a field.andP;  So do  Vienna&quot; and the other items on that line.andP;  All ofthe information relating to Ima is a record.andP;  This is the kind of informationtypically found in a secondary file.andP;  It's also the information I happen tohave in a dBASE file-which brings us back to the subject of this article.andO;Getting the data from DBASEandM;First, you must tell DBASE to copy or export the information you want into anASCII file.andP;  ASCII is an acronym for American Standard Coded InterfaceInterchange.andP;  ASCII files are basically neutral files; they don't have anysoftware-particular codes in them.andP;  WordPerfect and DBASE files are both fullof their own types of codes.andP;  If you strip the codes from the DBASE file, youcan get WordPerfect to convert that stripped ASCII file to a WordPerfectsecondary file.andM;Run DBASE and, at the dot prompt, type use CLIENTS.DB  substitute the name ofyour own DBASE file here) and press (Enter).andP;  You need to take a look at thefields in this database, so you'll know which ones to export.andM;Press  F5) to show the structure of the database.andP;  A screen resembling Screen1 should appear, with all the names and lengths of the fields in yourdatabase.andP;  In this example, you'll want to use the last name, first name,address, city, state and ZIP fields.andP;  The other fields are of no concern atthe moment.andP;  At the dot prompt, typecopy_fields_last,_first,_add,_,city,_state,_Zip_to_c:\wp50\files\wpeasy.txt_deli and press (Enter).andM;This command simply tells DBASE to copy the last, first, address, city, stateand ZIP fields to a file called WPEASY.TXT in the C-\WP50\FILES directory.andO;Me command &quot;deli&quot; at the end tells the program to  &quot;delimit,&quot; or separate,the fields and records in the file with commas and hard returns.andP;  It alsoencloses each field in quotes.andP;  If you prefer to use a different filename ordirectory, feel free to substitute it in this command.andP;  Exit DBASE by typingquit and pressing (Enter).andP;  Converting the fileandM;Next, convert WPEASY.TXT into a WordPerfect secondary merge file.andP;  Typecd/wp50 and press (Enter) to get into your WordPerfect subdirectory.andP;  Typeconvert and press (Enter).andM;Note.andP;  This assumes.andP;  that you have installed the Convert program in your 5.0directory.andP;  If this is not the case, change to the directory where Convert isinstalled or run the WP install program and install it at this time.andP;  Whenthe Convert program runs, it presents you with a Name of Input File? prompt.andO;Type c:\wp50\files\ wpeasy.txt and press (Enter).andP;  At the Name of OutputFile? prompt type c:\wp50\files\realeasy.txt and press (Enter).andM;A screen that looks like Screen 2 will appear.andP;  Press (9) Mail Merge toWordPerfect Secondary Merge and press (Enter).andP;  WordPerfect will ask for thecharacter used to delimit each field.andP;  DBASE uses a comma for this, so type acomma  (,) and press (Enter).andM;Now you must tell WordPerfect which character separates each record.andP;  DBASEuses a hard return for this purpose.andP;  In ASCII format, a hard return is madeup of two characters: a line feed (ASCII character 13) and a carriage return(10).andP;  To enter these ASCII codes, type 1131 1 1 O/ and press (Enter).andM;Now WordPerfect wants to know if it should strip any characters.andP;  In additionto the commas separating each field, DBASE has also enclosed them in quotes11).andP;  Since WordPerfect can't use these characters, type a quote  11) andpress (Enter) to have the Convert program take them out Now you're ready toget into WordPerfect and merge the files.andP;  Just don't tell your boss howsimple the job turned out to be.andM;Bonnie Lawson is a training and support consultant in Washington, DC.andM;.DISPLAY STRUCTUREandM;Structure for database: C:\CLIENTS.DBandM;Number of data records: 3andM;Date of last update: 10/23/90andM;Field   Field Name       Type           Width       DecandM;1   SSN              Character           9andM;2   FIRST            Character           5andM;3   LAST             Character           8andM;4   ADDRESS          Character          18andM;5   CITY             Character           8andM;6   STATE            Character           2andM;7   ZIP              Character           5andM;8   SALARY           Numeric             6         2andM;Total                                     62andM;Screen 1.andP;  DBASE Field ListandM;0 EXITandM;1  WordPerfect to another formatandM;2  Revisable-Form-Text (IBM DCA Format) to WordPerfectandM;3  Final-Form-Text (IBM DCA Format) to WordPerfectandM;4  Navy DIF Standard to WordPerfectandM;5  WordStar 3.3 to WordPerfectandM;6  MultiMate Advantage 11 to WordPerfectandM;7  Seven-Bit Transfer Format to WordPerfectandM;8  WordPerfect 4.2 to WordPerfect 5.1andM;9  Mail Merge to WordPerfect Secondary MergeandM;A  Spreadsheet DIF to WordPerfect Secondary MergeandM;B  Word 4.0 to WordPerfectandM;Enter number of Conversion desiredandM;WordPerfect Back to ASCIIandM;You've just exported information from a large database and converted it intoa WordPerfect 5.0 or 5.1 secondary merge file.andP;  During the merge process, younoticed a lot of errors in the file.andP;  Rather than repeat the conversionprocess, you quickly make the changes right in the secondary merge file andkeep going.andM;Now the mass mailing is over, and you have a secondary file full of changesand updates that need to be put back into your database.andP;  What next?
