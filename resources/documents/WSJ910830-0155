Moody's said it's reviewing the long-term debt ratings ofSanwa Bank Ltd., Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd. and Long-TermCredit Bank of Japan Ltd.</LP><TEXT>   The move follows the debt downgrading last week ofIndustrial Bank of Japan Ltd. and Norinchukin Bank, which hadbeen Japan's last banks with triple-A-rated debt. IBJ's debtrating was switched to double-A-2, while Norinchukin's waschanged to double-A-1, currently the highest rating for aJapanese bank. The agency has been downgrading the ratings ofJapanese bank debt in the past 18 months.   Moody's said the latest reviews would especially focus onthe three banks' internal controls, as well as their exposureto the real estate market and nonbank financial institutions.   The review of Sanwa's double-A-1 senior debt rating wouldaffect about $2.5 billion in long-term debt, while that ofMitsui Taiyo Kobe's double-A-3 rating would involve $3.7billion in debt. Moody's also is reviewing for possibledowngrade the ratings on $4.2 billion in Sanwa-supportedsecurities and $2.8 billion in issues backed by Mitsui TaiyoKobe letters of credit and bank guarantees. The two banks,which recently have been expanding consumer bankingactivities, are among the five largest banks in the world,Moody's said.   Meanwhile, the review of Long-Term Credit Bank'ssingle-A-1 rating would affect $5.8 billion in debt. Inaddition, Moody's will review the ratings of $2.5 billion insecurities supported by LTCB's letters of credit and bankguarantees. Moody's said it's also concerned about LTCB'sprofitability and viability with the continued deregulationof Japan's banking system. As a wholesale bank, LTCB focuseson lending to industry and doesn't take retail deposits orextend consumer loans.   The banks' short-term obligation aren't under review.</TEXT></DOC>
