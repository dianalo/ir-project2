 I know Abrahams is concerned about lack ofgrowth in ACM membership.andP;  It appears to me that ACM could lose quite a fewmembers rapidly by adopting political positions with which many memberssurely disagree.andM;Second, I'm embarrased at the naivete of much of his argument.andP;  It isunfortunate that he does not seem to be aware of balanced and criticalevaluations of SDI such as Harold Brown's article in Foreign Affairs &quot;Is SDITechnically Feasible?&quot;andP;  (Vol.andP;  64, #3, pp.andP;  435-454).andP;  Brown makes a numberof important points, particularly clarifying the fact that SDI represents arange of technologies and a range of potential programs based on thesetechnologies.andP;  Some of these programs could be developed and deployed in aten to fifteen year time frame, others might require twenty-five to thirtyyears.andP;  A system of the scope envisioned by President Reagan is not likely tobe feasible till late in that time frame, if indeed it is feasible at all.andO;Possible countermeasures to SDI, for  instance ground-based lasers targetedon SDI space platforms, tend to be variants of SDI technologies themselves.andM;To return to the Abrahams article, there is a serious case to be made againstSDI and he alludes to parts of it when he quotes Parnas and the AmericanMathematical Society.andP;  Unfortunately, his own argument demolishes straw menwithout coming to grips with the serious issues.andM;For instance, take his assertion that supporters of SDI commit &quot;two logicalfallacies.&quot;andP;  His first argument runs that &quot;...andP;  there is no objective test todetermine the success of SDI....andP;  Nature does not change its strategy,nations do....andP;  The success of SDI is inherently not testable.&quot;andP;  Thesestatements are certainly true, but they also apply with equal force to anyother policy we humans might adopt, including specifically a policy of notdeploying SDI.andP;  By the same argument, the success of not deploying SDI isinherently not testable.andP;  These statements do not constitute an argument foror against SDI, they are merely an observation about the uncertainty of theworld and the future.andP;  The fallacy belongs to Abrahams.andM;His second &quot;logical fallacy&quot; asserts that even if SDI were successful itwould be irrelevant because America could &quot;...andP;  invoke ...andP;  technicaloptimism ...andP;  penetrate the Soviet defense system and restore the potency ofour weapons.&quot;andP;  As noted in Brown's article, many anti-SDI technologies aresimply variants of SDI technologies, and they are likely to take ten tofifteen years to develop and deploy.andP;  Even a crash program might well takefive to ten years, and in that space of time of profound shift in worldbalance of power would almost assuredly occur.andP;  A successful SDI system couldfundamentally alter the future of the human race.andP;  Again the logical fallacybelongs to Abrahams.andM;The remainder of his arguments are almost as poor.andM;Finally, I am troubled by his implication that all ethical considerations lieon his side of this issue.andP;  Personally, I am a conscientious objector, andperformed alternative service during the Vietnam War.andP;  I am deeply opposed towar.andP;  SDI offers the possibility of a purely defensive response to the mosthorrible weapon yet devised--the ballistic missile armed with a nuclearwarhead.andP;  It intercepts and destroys that weapon in outer space in a mannerthat poses minimal risk to human life.andP;  In my scale of ethical values, I canthink of few things more worthwhile for our society to do.andP;  I recognize thatothers share the Abrahams ethical evaluation, and that there are many othervalid ethical perspectives on this issue.andP;  I hope that ACM as a society iswilling to recognize and respect the varying ethical and political views heldby its members.andP;  Philip Crawford 3815 Olive Ave. Long Beach, CA 90807andM;Previous letters have exhausted the political arguments surrounding the SDIcontroversy.andP;  However, many of the ideas put forth by Abrahams demand commenton from a purely technical viewpoint.andP;  I shall do my best to confine myremarks to those relevant to software development issues raised by Abrahamsremarks.andM;Abrahams attempts to judge whether SDI should be pursued based on criteriathat are generally not available until after the requirement analysis phaseis done.andP;  According to Tom DeMarco in his book (Structured Analysis andSystem Specification), successful completion of the analysis phase involves:a) selecting an optimal target; b) producing detailed documentation that canbe used to evaluate whether the implementation has attained the target; c)producing accurate predictions of important parameters such as costs,benefits, schedules, and performance characteristics; and d) obtainingconcurrence from all involved.andM;The analysis phase of software development is not the first phase.andP;  Softwaredevelopment begins with problem recognition and feasibility study.andP;  The sixfunctions of the feasibility study that Page-Jones in his book (The PracticalGuide to Structured Systems Design) states must be tentatively approachedare: a) identifying the scope of the current system; b) identifying problemswith the current system; c) identifying major objectives for the new systems;d) identifying a number of solutions as Dr. Matley suggested in his letter(Sept.andP;  1988 Forum, p. 1040) to satisfy the user's needs; e) developing roughestimates of the benefits and drawbacks of each system; and f) developingoutlines of how the project might be completed and what resources may berequired.andP;  President Reagan's 1983 speech was the very first step towards afeasibility study, or possibly just a latter part of the problem recognitionphase, and as such though admittedly flawed is hardly an embarrassment anddoes not require explaining away, much less disavowal.andP;  Professionally, theonly criticism that we can heap upon it at this point is its breadth of scopeand lack of alternatives.andM;In order to contrast the waterfall approach to the software development lifecycle, a seminar presented by Software Consultants International, Ltd.andO;(Structured Analysis for Real-Time Systems) discussed what they called the&quot;baroque&quot; life cycle.andP;  This life cycle was based on the hypothesis that eachphase of software development must be thoroughly completed before the nextphase is begun.andP;  This is the concept of &quot;freezing the specification&quot; thatDeMarco takes such pains to discredit in his above mentioned book.andP;  Rarely inwhat academia admits is the real world is there a specific, well-defined,clear, and testable statement of the system's function even after theanalysis phase is completed.andP;  This comes as quite a shock to most recentgraduates in computer science whose textbook assignments had such specificrequirements already laid out.andP;  This situation is what led to the developmentof structured analysis.andM;For SDI, a definitive and testable proposition is vital, but in accordancewith the principles of analysis, it cannot be stated before the analysisphase is even begun.andM;Abrahams' technically conservative view of technical optimism as Pollyannaishwould subvert the first three of the Seven Ages of software development(problem recognition, feasibility study, and analysis) if it were used tocriticize all other large scale computing projects.andP;  The slightest hint ofdifficulty--or even complexity--would be automatically condemned astechnically optimistic.andP;  Abrahams' original thesis on technical optimism,however, concerns its use in developing unstoppable missiles as well asimpenetrable shields, as in Ng's parable (in Sept. 1988 Forum, p. 1042).andP;  Theproblem with that is that it is based on the idea that SDI technology will beas jealously guarded as missile technology currently is, yet President Reaganhas pledged the sharing of SDI technology with the USSR.andP;  If it is, Abrahams'condemnation of optimism collapses.andM;The OTA's finding are very familiar.andP;  Similar condemnation of traditionallydeveloped software, especially large and complex systems, can be found in thefirst few chapters of almost any book on structured requirements definition,structured analysis, structured design, structured programming, softwareengineering, and configuration management.andP;  Unlike the OTA, these books go onto suggest techniques for overcoming these historical problems and changingthe course of software development itself.andP;  This may seem like a suggestionthat SDI be used to implement these suggestions industry-wide through DoDsponsorship, which Belmont finds so horrific (in Sept. 1988 Forum, p. 1039),yet is this not the principle behind DoD sponsorship of Ada?andP;  Does not ACMalready support this idea through SIGAda?andM;Abrahams' distillation of Fred Reed's article in Harper's Magazine shows me aliberal journalist's view of the feasibility study and analysis phases ofsoftware development.andP;  Although I am initially tempted to take Reed to taskfor his lack of software or engineering expertise, I recall that the skillsneeded for analysis are more diplomatic and interpersonal than technical ormanagerial.andP;  Again, DeMarco contrasts analysis with design and implementationby describing the task of obtaining concurrence among conflicting parties asgargantuan.andP;  He goes on to speak about the complicated and sometimes hostileinterpersonal relationships that must be faced, the indefiniteness ofanalysis--even about when the phase is complete, and the frustrating natureof the number of compromises that must be made.andP;  What Reed has written couldvery well be a description of the analysis phase of any large scale softwaresystem.andP;  It reminds me of the interaction between a sales force and thehigher echelons of a potential client company.andP;  Rather than condemn SDIspecifically, Reed's article condemns software projects in general, which isthe basis of the OTA's opinion.andP;  Reed is guilty of the fallacy of accident.andM;As to the opinion that SDI's proponents diversified and spread out contractsto a wide variety of companies at home and abroad not in deference to themaxim, &quot;Don't put all your eggs in one basket,&quot; but rather in an effort tobuild an economic constituency, it seems as fallacious as the old opinionthat programmers &quot;inadvertently&quot; put bugs in software and made systems hardto maintain in order to give themselves job security.andP;  The fallacy inquestion is post hoc ergo propter hoc, or is A occurs after B, A must becaused by B.andP;  On the other hand, the push for rapid deployment might be anattempt to bind the next administration to SDI, yet this is no longernecessary.andP;  Both Bush and Dukakis have voiced support for SDI, though Dukakisless convincingly.andM;There is however one (and only one) point where Abrahams and I do agree, andthat is that ACM refrain from taking any official position on SDI, either foror against.andP;  Norman Hines Martin Marietta Data Systems 900 Herritage Dr.andO;Ridgecrest, CA 93555andM;As a long time ACM Member, I would like to respond to Paul Abrahams' opinionconcerning the Strategic Defense Initiative, addressed in his President'sLetter in the June 1988 issue.andM;First, let me say that having served as Treasurer and member of the ExecutiveCommittee of one of the world's leading scientific research institutions Ihave come to one conclusion viz: the degree of certainty with which mostscientists express an opinion on any subject is inversely proportional totheir knowledge of the subject.andP;  This rule seems to apply to the first threesections of the letter in which he expresses opinions on the strategic andpolitical aspects of SDI, which are not in his field of expertise.andP;  Inreading this letter, it became obvious to me that his real reasons foropposing SDI are contained in the last section of th is letter.andP;  Due tofederal budgets pressures, SDIO has created competition for government fundscurrently going to computer science research.andP;  Computer science researchersdo not want to leave their pet government-supported projects to work underSDIO contracts.andP;  The letter even admits that the anti-SDI resolution adoptedby the American Mathematical Society was related to this competition.andM;I am sorry but I am afraid that the so called &quot;ethical considerations&quot; arereally turf protection rationalizations as are the arguments against softwarereliability.andP;  Actually, if computer scientists cared more about the broadfuture of computer science than of their own pet projects, they would welcomethe opportunity to work on SDI where great advances will be made in computertechnology.andP;  Those scientists working for SDI on the problem of reliabilityof hardware and software believe that adequate reliability and redundancy canbe achieved.andM;Here are a few scattered comments on other portions of the letter:andM;1) The conclusion made public by a small committee of the American PhysicalSociety were proven to be badly flawed at a debate which I attended, at theKennedy School of Government at Harvard University between ProfessorBlomberg, President of the Society, and an expert representative from SDIO.andO;Even Prof.andP;  Blomberg, at the end, admitted that the report needed to becorrected and the committee conclusions reconsidered.andP;  As I understood it,the conclusions of the report were drawn up by a small committee and releasedto the press in time to coincide with Congressional voting on SDI but beforethe members had time to study or approve the report.andP;  Furthermore, theSociety did not even consider the successfully tested kinetic energy form ofdefense.andP;  The major problem with this form of strategic missile defense ispolitical not technical.andM;2) The argument that SDI has to be perfect is ridiculous.andP;  Nobody involved,that I know, has ever stated &quot;perfect or not at all.&quot; Even an 80 percent or90 percent defense would deter the Soviets from launching an all out attacknot knowing which 10 percent or 20 percent of their targets they would hit.andO;Furthermore President Reagan did not imply that SDI had to be perfect or notat all!andM;Consider this scenario: Tomorrow there is accidentally launched anintercontinental ballistic missile targeted on Washington.andP;  30 minutes latereverything inside the Beltway is utterly annihilated.andP;  Should this scenariohappen, there is nothing that this country could do to prevent this ghastlyconclusion.andP;  With more and more countries acquiring such missiles thisconceivably could happen.andM;3) Why are many American scientists sure that SDI is impossible whenSecretary Gorbachev obviously thinks otherwise and is pouring funds into aSoviet SDI?andP;  Furthermore, he is trying hard to derail our SDI by fair meansor foul.andM;4) At the end of the second paragraph of the President's Letter, it assumesthat, even if the Soviets succeed in their present program of rendering ournuclear missiles useless as a deterrent (and thereby inviting nuclearblackmail by them), our scientists would find a way to penetrate the SovietSDI and thus &quot;restore the potency of our weapons.&quot;andM;This is an extremely dangerous and misleading argument!andP;  Given a year to 18months and the full backing of the U.S.andP;  Government and the American people,I agree that we might find a way to penetrate the Soviet defenses.andP;  Howeverit would be naive and unwise to assume that the Soviets would then sit backand do nothing while we take away their hard won strategic advantage.andP;  At thevery least, they would press their blackmailing advantage to the limit, or,if that failed, launch an allout nuclear attack against us.andP;  A governmentthat annihilated ten million of its own citizens for not bowing to its willis hardly likely to have any compunctions about eliminating as many Americansas needed to secure compliance with whatever demands they choose to make tomeet their goal of an all-Communist world.andP;  Despite Glasnost, they have notformally renounced that goal.andM;Please forgive me if I refer to my own experience during World War II asbackground for the conclusions expressed in the preceding paragraph.andP;  In theseveral months just before Pearl Harbor, I remember that most Americans werestrongly isolationist believing that we should stay neutral, protected by twogreat oceans.andP;  Even three weeks before Pearl Harbor, the draft act passed byonly 1 or 2 votes!andP;  Pearl Harbor changed all that overnight.andP;  Shortlythereafter, I joined the staff of Radio Research Laboratory set up at HarvardUniversity under a secret U.S.andP;  Government contract to do American and Alliedresearch and engineering on all aspects of radar countermeasures.andP;  At thattime the Germans were miles ahead of us in the design and manufacture ofradar-controlled anti-aircraft guns.andP;  As a member of the laboratory'smanagement team, I was closely involved in subsequent events.andP;  By 1944 we hadinvented the necessary countermeasures in just the nick of time.andP;  The EighthAir Force's heavy bombing attack on strategic targets deep in Germany(necessary as a prelude to the invasion of the continent) was running intoheavy and unsustainable losses from the deadly accurate radar controlledGerman anti-aircraft guns.andP;  However, with the aid of &quot;window&quot; and &quot;Carpet&quot;chaff and jammers, the guns' radars were blinded and the tide turned just intime.andP;  The moral of that bit of history is that we were totally unpreparedwhen Pearl Harbor struck but thanks to the British and American Air Forcesand Navies we were given the time for our ingenuity to catch up.andP;  Today wewill have no such time once the Soviets have their own SDI fully operative(it is already deployed around Moscow).andP;  Our window of opportunity is here.andO;Now is the time, to proceed, as fast as possible, while we still can.andP;  To dootherwise is a crime against our children's future for which they will neverforgive us.andP;  Edwin D. Brooks, Jr.andP;  19 Commonwealth Ave. Boston, MA 02116andM;Response from the Past President: With the resignation of General Abrahamsonas head of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, the end ofPresident Reagan's term, and the thawing of relations between the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union, the whole issue of SDI has become muted.andP;  GeorgeBush, while not disavowing SDI, seems to be far less passionately enamored ofthe idea.andP;  I believe that the growing skepticism in the scientific communityand in Congress also has something to do with this, although the idea surelyhas not gone away.andM;Since I have already replied to a previous round of letters on this subjectin the September 1988 Communications, I shall try to avoid repeating myearlier arguments.andP;  I will admit that the startling idea, suggested indifferent forms by Crawford and Hines, that we should build SDI withoutknowing what it will do had never occurred to me.andP;  Crawford is surely rightin his suggestion that if we have no criteria for the success of SDI, theproposition that SDI can work is as irrefutable as it is unprovable.andP;  Hinesargues that the latest thinking in software engineering suggests thatspecifications should be interleaved with design rather than frozen beforedesign, an idea I fully agree with and even argued for in one of myPresident's Letters.andP;  He then concludes that the lack of clear specificationsfor SDI should not be viewed as a weakness of the system.andM;Were it possible to build SDI for a mere megabuck or so, and were theconstruction of SDI to be as benevolent and unthreatening as its supportersmake it out to be, the idea that we should just try it out and see whathappens would be irresistible.andP;  Alas, t'ain't so.andP;  SDI, if pursued, promiseseven by the reckoning of its supporters to be the most expensive militarysystem built by any nation at any time in history.andP;  As to its beingbenevolent and unthreatening, its offensive potential is fully as great as,if not greater than, its defensive potential.andP;  Such a system, were it to havethe ability to halt incoming strategic nuclear missiles, would allow anuclear strike by its possessor without fear of retaliation.andP;  Imagine how we(the US) would feel if the Soviets were about to complete such a system.andO;Would we allow the final steps to be carried out unimpeded?andP;  Just considerhow the United States has reacted to the completion of the Krasnoyarsk radarin Siberia, or how Israel reacted to the construction of a nuclear plant inIraq.andP;  Surely the existence of a strategic defense system nearly but notquite complete would tempt--or should I say goad--almost any opponent into apreemptive strike.andM;Both Crawford and Brooks are concerned that the Soviet Union might build anSDI system, and the United States would then be helpless for the ten tofifteen years that, by their arguments, it would take to overcome it.andP;  If itwould take us decades to build our own SDI system, it would surely take theSoviet Union, with its technological disadvantages, at least that long.andO;During that time we would surely not be sitting by idly.andM;They also seem not to understand what I wrote about the symmetry oftechnological optimism.andP;  They argue that I was being unreasonably optimisticin my assessment that we could &quot;penetrate the Soviet defense system andrestore the potency of our weapons.&quot;andP;  To reiterate the central point of myargument: SDI has been justified on the basis of technological optimism--evenif we do not know how to do it now, we will surely find a way.andP;  Either youbelieve in technological optimism or you do not.andP;  It makes no sense to applythe principle selectively.andP;  If you do not believe in it, then it is very hardto argue that SDI is likely to work.andP;  But if you do believe in it, then youmust admit that it applies as equally to the offense as to the defense, andas equally to the Soviet Union as to the United States.andP;  Chen Ng's parable ofthe irresistible spear and the impenetrable shield in the SeptemberCommunications makes the point beautifully.andM;Euler, Venn, Peirce, andandM;All the RestandM;I would like to respond to Fritz Lehmann's comments on my article &quot;On VisualFormalisms&quot; (May, 1988, pp.andP;  514-530) that appeared in his letter to theForum (&quot;Neglected Work,&quot; December, 1988, pp.andP;  1374-1375).andP;  Lehmann's letteraccuses me of negligence in failing to refer to Charles S. Peirce's work andalso claims that Peirce anticipated many of my ideas and those of others.andP;  Itis quite surprising that the editors did not find it appropriate to solicitmy response prior to publication, in accordance with the Forum's usualpolicy.andP;  I therefore offer an unsolicited response.andM;Charles Sanders Peirce, an American, was one of the most versatile figures in19th century science, contributing to logic, philosophy, mathematics, andeven psychology.andP;  Logicians and philosophers know him mainly from his work onabduction and the logic of induction.andP;  Some of his more peripheral ideas,however, are considered to be somewhat esoteric, and his work on graphicaldescriptions is an excellent example of this.andP;  His existential graphs, whenconsidered as objects that are to be comprehended and manipulated by humans,are viewed by many as being awkward and unwidely.andP;  As Lehmann himself pointsout, there appears to be only one effort in AI to extend Peirce's more basicwork and use it in a real application.andP;  Also, in eighty years no one seems tohave found it worthwhile to complete his more advanced ideas on graphicalrepresentation and put them to the test.andP;  During the extensive bibliographicsearch I carried out when writing the paper under discussion I discovered noadditional substantial use of Peirce's ideas, in any field.andM;Now, obviously Peirce's diagrams do satisfy the essential requirements of avisual formalism as put forward in my paper.andP;  Indeed, a historical survey ofsuch formalisms would be badly incomplete without mentioning Peirce's work orJohn Sowa's use of it in AI.andP;  However, since the paper is not a historicalsurvey, the question of whether failing to refer to this work is negligencerequires close examination.andP;  The question of whether his work anticipates myown requires even closer examination.andM;The nature of Peirce's diagrams and the general attitude towards them shouldbe contrasted with the strikingly applicable nature of the elegant, simple,and considerably earlier ideas for visual representation due to LeonhardEuler (1707-1783).andP;  These ideas are embodied in the standard notion ofgraphs, as we have come to know them, and in Euler circles.andP;  As explained inthe paper, Euler circles eventually became known as Venn diagrams, due to thework of John Venn (who was more or less a contemporary of Peirce) onextending them with shadings to define logical propositions.andP;  It is Euler'swork, not Peirce's or even Venn's, that the higraph formalism defined in mypaper tries humbly to extend.andM;From the examples accompanying Lehmann's comments it seems clear that he isreally concerned with the controversy that surrounded the work of Venn andPeirce, over the best way to visually capture the complete set ofpropositional formulas.andP;  In this case, the comments are inappropriatelyaddressed, since my paper has nothing at all to do with this issue.andP;  It wasnot my purpose, any more than it was Euler's, to propose a complete graphicalmeans for stating assertions in the propositional calculus or in elementaryset theory.andP;  That has been done many times and in almost as many ways, as thework of Peirce and Venn illustrates.andP;  Indeed, there are advantages anddisadvantages in each of these approaches: Venn associates a proposition withthe set of objects that make it true, adopts Euler's representation of setsas simple closed Jordan curves in the plane, and adds shades to denote emptysets.andP;  Peirce, as Lehmann explains in his letter, represents truth by anoccurrence of the proposition's name, and represents negation by itsencapsulation in a curve.andP;  With all due respect to both these gentlemen,neither approach is perfect: Venn gets into trouble when it comes tointricate compound propositions, and needs multiple-shadings and apparentlyimpossible overlappings; Peirce gets into trouble when one tries tounderstand an arbitrary drawing that involves many interlocking lassocurves.andO;That Peirce also attempted to cover individual elements, variables, andquantifiers, is of interest in its own right but is even less relevant to mypaper.andM;From Lehmann's comments it appears that he has either missed or isoverlooking the issues that the paper does address.andP;  The paper is concernedwith a more delicate and pressing matter: the visual description of complexsituations arising in a variety of computer-related fields, which arecharacterized by: set-theoretical (or logical) relationships, as well asother uninterpreted relationships; by exponential blow-up in size; and by theabsence of clear and well-structured, yet rigorous and precise,representations.andP;  The purpose of the paper was to propose one particularformalism, highgraphs, for dealing with this problem, and in so doing toillustrate the fundamental and robust nature of Euler's work, and the way itlends itself to natural and useful extensions.andP;  The paper then attempts tojustify the choices made in the construction of higraphs by describing anumber of applications, including ones that have already been found helpfulin real areas of application.andM;Peirce's work has nothing to do with the paper's proposals (and, indeed,neither does Venn's; he was mentioned simply because his name becameassociated with Euler's circles).andP;  Indeed, it would be interesting to seewhether Peirce's existential graphs can help solve the problem of specifyingthe behavior of complex reactive systems (the way the higraph-based languageof statecharts has), or that of specifying intricate security constraints inoperating systems (the way Tygar and Wing's recent higraph-based work has).andM;On this basis I plead complete innocence to the charge of negligence.andM;Equally disturbing is Lehmann's statement to the effect that Peirceanticipated many of my ideas and those of others.andP;  Let us first discuss the&quot;others.&quot;andP;  Who does he have in mind?andP;  Euler came a century earlier thanPeirce.andP;  Maybe Venn?andP;  It is possible that Peirce anticipated some of Venn'sideas, but this cannot be deduced from a comparison of Peirce's existentialgraphs with Venn's totally different shaded circles.andP;  And, anyway, I cannotsee any reason to drag my paper into this.andM;Now to my own work.andP;  The graphical ideas suggested in the paper are few andsimple: representing all set-theoretical relationships in the blob-structure(in particular, no is-a edges), insisting on separate contours for all setsof interest, representing Cartesian products by partitioning, and addingedges or hyperedges to the resulting extended Euler circles to obtainhigraphs.andP;  The additional idea put forward in the paper is the apparentusefulness of higraphs in a wide spectrum of computer-related activities.andP;  Ibelieve that none of these ideas had been anticipated or hinted at by Peirce.andO;Moreover, I claim to have done my very best in referring to whatever otherwork is relevant to these ideas or variations thereof, and would appreciatereceiving comments as to real negligence in this respect.andM;I agree with Lehmann that my paper does not address implementation issues.andO;It was not meant to.andP;  However, the paper mentions and refers to a system thatforms a combined implementation of three higraph-based languages [5].andP;  Theinterested reader can contact the designers of that system for moreinformation about the implementation techniques behind it.andM;Finally, I completely agree with Lehmann that there does not seem to be aclear and elegant textual way of representing the kinds of structures thathigraphs are capable of; if there were, we probably would not be sodesperately in need of visual means.andP;  David Harel The Weizmann Institute ofScience Rehovot, 76100, Israel (1-972) 8-483-545andM;On VirusesandM;I must express some frustration and dissatisfaction with the referencedpiece.andP;  (President's Letter, Communications, Jan. 1989).andP;  It is short onaction and long on sweeping generalizations.andP;  In particular, It draws someamazing conclusions, to wit (the quotes are President Kocher's):andM;1.andP;  &quot;[The November UNIX epidemic...] did not damage any of the machinesinfected.&quot;andP;  and &quot;...the attacking 'virus' was non-destructive.&quot;andP;  May Isuggest damage is in the eyes of the beholder?andP;  (Performance still has somevalue to some of us!)andM;2.andP;  &quot;Obviously, the perpetrators assumed that the infected systems' ownerswould realize they had been pranked.&quot;andP;  Nothing is obvious, especially the useof the word &quot;prank[ed].&quot;andP;  Certainly none of the installation managers on theInternet thought of it as a prank.andM;3.andP;  &quot;More importantly, the prankster apparently wanted the Internet communityto realize that truly dangerous infections would not announce theirpresence.&quot;andP;  Apparently, the author knows when people are behaving&quot;apparently&quot; very altruistically.andM;4.andP;  &quot;That [...one day's to one week's work would be lost] is not a big losscompared to the PC users...&quot; seems like a most unjustifiable characterizationof the value of the daily work performed on the Internet.andM;5.andP;  &quot;A destructive prank wouldn't be catastrophic on Internet.&quot;andP;  As a memberof the former AFIPS Panel on the Resiliency of U.S.andP;  Society [to ComputerAbuse], I have to agree that a destructive &quot;prank&quot; will not bring down theAmerican way of life.andP;  However, it is presumptuous and disingenuous of theauthor to suggest, in this context, that such a &quot;prank&quot; would not becatastrophic to some users of the Internet.andP;  Furthermore, the Internet, fromits humble origins as the ARPANET to today, remains an incredibly valuablenational research tool; any interference with its use is a great loss to theresearch community and the potential implications of virus-induced errors incomputations, e.g.andP;  high-energy physics, aerodynamics, and even simplemechanical design, are awesome.andM;Actually, the selection of the word &quot;prank&quot; is, in itself, objectionable.andO;This is especially so in light of the pending possible prosecution of thealleged perpetrator.andP;  Indeed, it is not proper for an ACM officer torepresent and offer an unsolicited public opinion as to the seriousness ofsuch an act or the &quot;apparent&quot; intent of the alleged perpetrator.andP;  A moreappropriate public position to take, if any, would be that ACM condemns theunauthorized use of computing resources, considers such acts unethical (whichis probably the most favorable possible way of characterizing them), andcalls for a prompt and concerted application of the apprpriate laws and theresolution of the legal issues (if ambiguities exist) so that the rules canbe better understood (if they are unclear).andM;President Kocher's remarks about the epidemic conditions of the virus areperfectly appropriate and he should be encouraged to carry that message tothe public.andP;  Better, though, would be his assessment of what ACM can or willdo.andP;  For example, will ACM amend its emasculated Code of Professional Conduct(Bylaw 19) to better define the behavior deemed unacceptable in its members?andO;Will ACM bring disciplinary action against members convicted of criminal lawsproscribing this type of behavior, or of those found violating the ACM Code?andO;Will ACM establish a monitoring and reporting activity that provides factualand informed assessments of these cases of computer abuse?andP;  Does ACM have anyproposals?andM;As a former President of ACM, I suspect the answers to those questions arenot affirmative.andP;  And, on the issue of enforcement, ACM has never had muchappetite for a real conflict over ethical and moral issues.andP;  The probabilitythat the ACM Council would prosecute a violation of its own Code ofProfessional Conduct is vanishingly (and laughingly) small.andP;  David H.
