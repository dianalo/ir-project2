They arenot.''   Former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr said Tuesday inParis that Richard Lawless, a former U.S. official, had negotiatedon behalf of Vice President George Bush with a representative ofIranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani.   In reply, Mrs. Oakley said: ``We have flatly denied anyone isspeaking on behalf of the U.S. government.''   Lawless, president of a Washington-based trade investment firmknown as U.S.-Asia, denied through a business partner that he hadengaged in any talks with Iranians about the hostages.   In a statement Lawless relayed through partner Therese Shaheen,he said, ``I categorically deny, and state for the record, that Iam involved either directly or indirectly in any discussions ornegotiations with any party related to attempts to secure therelease of hostages in Lebanon.''   Ms. Shaheen said Lawless can produce passport and charge cardtravel records that prove he was not in that part of the worldduring the time that Bani-Sadr says he was involved. Lawless is aformer State Department employee who served in Seoul, South Korea;Vienna, Austria; and Tokyo, Japan, Ms. Shaheen said.   The New York Times and The Washington Times, quoting sourcesthey did not identify, reported Wednesday that Lawless worked forthe CIA at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul in the 1970s, during the sameperiod Bush's national security adviser, Donald Gregg, served withthe CIA in Korea.   In addition, The New York Times quoted an unidentified formergovernment official as saying that Lawless had worked in the CIA'soperations directorate until several years ago.   The State Department's Biographic Register said in its 1974edition that Lawless had worked as an ``area analyst'' for thePentagon and the State Department.   Mrs. Oakley said the United States had urged other governmentsto use their influence to secure the release of the nine Americansheld in Lebanon by pro-Iranian bands.   But she said none of the messages exchanged between the U.S. andIranian governments through other countries dealt specifically withreleasing the hostages.   ``That would involve dealings, negotiations,'' the spokeswomansaid. ``There have been no negotiations on this issue.''   Asked if Lawless or any other private individual had negotiatedwith Iran, Mrs. Oakley said: ``I don't know of anybody who has donethat. But that doesn't exclude the possibility that there may besomebody out there, as we speak, who says `I'm speaking for theU.S. government.' I`m just trying to be very prudent and cautious.But I don't know of any names of anyone who is doing this.''   She added: ``Only U.S. government officials are authorized tospeak on this matter, and none have.''   Her immediate comment on Bani-Sadr's assertions were two bluntwords: ``Pure fantasy.''   With the arrival of Mithileshwar Singh, a freed Indian hostage,at the U.S. military hospital in Wiesbaden, West Germany, and alack of indications the nine Americans would be released, a StateDepartment task force set up Monday to deal with the situation wasdisbanded Tuesday evening.   President Reagan, talking to reporters, said he has heardnothing to indicate other hostages might soon be set free. ``Wedesperately are hoping, continuing to try,'' he said.   But he also said, ``I've never been able to explain ... theIranians, what their strategies are and what they do. But obviouslywe could not do any negotiating with them unless and until thehostages are released.''   Mrs. Oakley said Singh, a legal U.S. resident, would travel tothe United States after a thorough medical examination inWiesbaden, but his plans had not jelled.   She said a preliminary checkup in Damascus, where he had beentaken by Syrian forces after his release Monday in Beirut,confirmed he had ``previously known problems'' of diabetes,hypertension and possible coronary artery disease and had lost aconsiderable amount of weight and muscle mass during his 20-monthcaptivity.   ``He was treated with appropriate medicines, is in good spiritsand has traveled well,'' Mrs. Oakley said of the 60-year-oldchairman of the business administration department at the BeirutUniversity College.   Singh had been held by the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation ofPalestine. Nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italianand a Belgian remain in captivity in Lebanon, according to theState Department's Office for Counter-Terrorism. Three of theAmericans are believed held by the group that freed Singh.</TEXT></DOC>
