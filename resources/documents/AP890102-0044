At least 51people died, and divers searched for other victims today.   Authorities today said they would seek homicide charges againstthose responsible for letting the jammed flat-bottomed craft _ builtto hold 100 people _ go out. They said it ignored Port Authorityorders not to sail in Saturday's choppy seas.   Survivors said few life jackets were accessible when the 100-footBateau Mouche went down Saturday night in 65 feet of water about amile from shore. One survivor, Plinco Donadio, said, ``I watched mywife die because I couldn't untie one of the life preservers to saveher.''   As army divers searched the Atlantic Ocean and Guanabara Bay offRio, confusion continued regarding how many people were on thedouble-decked sightseeing boat Bateau Mouche. Estimates have rangedfrom 130-150.   The passenger list was on the sunken ship, said the company thatbooked the cruise. Officials gave no estimate of survivors.   ``We think the majority of the bodies already have been takenout, but there always is the possibility of finding more,'' said Lt.Pedro Paulo Albuquerque of the Fire Department's Maritime Group.   Irineu Barroso, a police precinct chief, said he hoped to seek anindictment for homicide. ``We are taking statements from survivors,and they are telling us that something aboard that boat was notright.''   Cid Castor, a director of Itatitaia Turismo, which booked the$220-per-person cruise, said his travel company had noresponsibility for the operation of the outing.   ``We are simply ticket sellers,'' said Castor, who said thepassenger list was on the ship.   The Sol e Mar restaurant, the boat's operator, referred calls toa local lawyer, but no one answered the number given.   ``We don't know the exact cause of the sinking, but we think itwas because of excess capacity,'' said Maj. Oldemiro Santos of theFire Department's Maritime Group.   The boat had a seven-piece samba band playing on board and tablesset for dinner when it capsized.   Passenger Fabricio Calo, who was rescued by a fishing boat, said:``The boat was turning and shifting. Then tables started flying,glass started crashing, and the whole boat just turned over on itsside.''   Luxury yachts and smaller boats heading to watch the midnightpyrotechnics display fished survivors from the stormy seas near thebase of Sugar Loaf mountain.   ``We rescued about 30 people from the sea,'' said ValentinoRibeiro, captain of one vessel, the Casablanca. ``There were peopleeverywhere screaming for help. We took those we could and left thebodies. We couldn't take on any more.''   Officials said at least 51 people died. They had no reports ofAmericans on board.   Brazil's largest private network, Globo TV, quoted maritimespecialists saying the boat was not made to withstand Saturdaynight's choppy sea waters.   But the Sol e Mar's spokesman, Gustavo Blanco, said Sunday thatthe boat was ``in perfect mechanical shape.''   According to Denmark's Hans Nihaj, who was on the boat with hiswife, daughter and five fellow countrymen _ all of whom swam tosafety _ there were no adequate life jackets or preservers on board.   ``We made it because we were strong and could swim,'' Nihaj toldThe Associated Press. ``If you weren't in good shape, you simplydied.''   Donadio, a photographer who lost his wife and two otherrelatives, said the life preservers were ``tied onto the railings inthe lower part of the boat.''   The vessel was so crowded that a naval vessel ordered it toreturn to port, but it ignored the order, Barroso said.   Survivors confirmed this account.   The cruise boat's captain, Camilo da Costa, ``didn't want to goout,'' said his brother-in-law, Paulo Soares.   ``He called us to say the boat was overloaded and the sea was toorough. But he had no choice. He would lose his job if he didn'tsail.''   Da Costa died.</TEXT></DOC>
