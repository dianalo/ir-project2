The GAO based its conclusion primarily on a review of theFDIC's Denver office, where it found that the FDIC soldinvestors worthless or overvalued loans from failed banks.&quot;This almost total breakdown in fundamental controls hasresulted in assets that are grossly overvalued, and in theFDIC's losing control over cash receipts, loan delinquenciesand account records,&quot; said the GAO, the audit arm ofCongress.</LP><TEXT>   Based on these findings and other reports by the FDIC'sinspector general, the GAO concluded that similar problemsexist in other FDIC offices, risking an erosion of investorconfidence that could &quot;hinder the agency's loan salesprogram.&quot;   The FDIC conceded that it had problems in Denver and saidit has launched a program to fix them. But the agency saidthere isn't &quot;any basis for suggesting that these problems arewidespread.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
