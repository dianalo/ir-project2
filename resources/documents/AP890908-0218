A former top Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. executive, Dennis T.Palmeri, has reached a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty tocriminal charges and cooperate in the probe, which began more than ayear ago, the source said Thursday, speaking anonymously.   The case is said to be derived from information from Boesky, thejailed speculator who has been a major source of evidence for WallStreet securities investigations since he was ensnared in an insidertrading probe in 1986.   Stock loaning is the business of lending large blocks of stockfor a fee, usually to big investors who need stock quickly and areunable or unwilling to purchase enough shares.   A person familiar with the stock-loan case said Palmeri,Shearson's former executive vice president in charge of stock loans,would enter a guilty plea to criminal counts by the end of Octoberin a deal with the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to offerother details about the charges. But the investigation was said toinclude alleged kickbacks received by Palmeri while he headed thestock-loan operation.   It also involves stock-loan corruption at other major brokerages,the source said. But no other brokerage executives or otherofficials have reached plea deals with the government or have beenidentified in the investigation.   A federal grand jury last year issued subpoenas to Shearsonseeking information about Palmeri's trading activities. Shearsonsaid at the time that it did not believe the firm or any employeeswere targets of an investigation.   Asked for comment about the expected Palmeri guilty plea, aShearson official said the firm still does not believe it is atarget.   ``The U.S. attorney's office has requested information fromShearson Lehman Hutton relating to a former employee of ourstock-loan department and we have been cooperating fully with therequest,'' Shearson said in a statement.   Palmeri's attorney, Stanley Arkin, declined to comment on thecase. A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, Deborah Corley,also declined to comment.   Palmeri began working at Shearson in 1979. He resigned June 28after taking a leave of absence from the firm in April because ofthe investigation, a Shearson spokesman said.   He had supervised a department that specializes in lending blocksof stock mostly to large institutional investors and speculators.Boesky had borrowed stock from Shearson.   Major brokerages such as Shearson, 62 percent-owned by AmericanExpress Co., maintain large inventories of stocks typically loanedto clients. Stock loans frequently are used in ``short-selling,'' astrategy used to profit from an expected price decline in a stock.   A speculator will sell borrowed stock at a high price, wait forthe price to fall, repurchase the shares at the lower price andreturn them to the lender, pocketing the price difference as aprofit.   The tactic is risky because the price might not fall and theborrower must return the stock within a limited time.   Violations alleged by the government in other stock-loan cases inrecent years include improper payments in return for interest-freestock loans, unauthorized stock lending and fake transactions.   Shearson was censured by the Securities and Exchange Commissionin 1987 for alleged unlawful use of customers' stock for loansduring one week in November 1985, including $69 million ofsecurities illegally loaned in one day. Shearson said the violationswere technical and agreed to internal procedural changes.</TEXT></DOC>
