The selection ends weeks of speculation over which of four teams would win the Army job, which will bring hefty contracts over the next decade. Initially, the Army plans to award the Marietta-Oerlikon Buhrle team a $97 million contract to produce four systems for operational testing. This would be followed by a $1.7 billion contract to produce 166 units. Altogether, the Army wants 562 of the air defense weapons.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Martin Marietta's shares closed at $38.375, down 87.5 cents.    Other rivals in the Army competition included versions of air defense systems already fielded by other countries such as the Liberty system, designed by LTV Corp. and the French concern, Thomson CSF; the Paladin system, offered by the Hughes Aircraft Co. unit of General Motors Corp., Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm of West Germany, and SNI Aerospatiale of France; and the Rapier, proposed by United Technologies Corp., British Aerospace Inc., and FMC Corp.    The air defense anti-tank system is one element in a complex of systems designed to protect ground forces against air attack. The Army is still evaluating competing proposals for the other elements of the larger complex. The Army's first attempt to provide air defense against increasingly capable Soviet helicopters ended in a costly failure: the Ford Motor Co. Divad gun, which the Pentagon canceled two years ago.    Martin Marietta officials said that about 70% of the production work will be performed in the U.S., with the remainder done by Oerlikon Aerospace, a Canadian unit of the Swiss company. Oerlikon estimated it will receive $750 million in contracts for five years; it expects to assemble about 70 of the missile systems at a facility near Montreal.    In other contract awards yesterday, General Motors units received Navy jobs totaling $128.6 million for Phoenix missiles and T-56 aircraft engine parts.    Units of Boeing won contracts totaling $60.9 million for weapon-launching equipment for B-52 aircraft and B-1B aircraft improvements for the Air Force, and CH-47D helicopter improvements for the Army.    Grumman Aerospace Corp., a unit of Grumman Corp., was given Navy contracts totaling $57.4 million for F-14 aircraft improvements and EA-6B aircraft production.    Lockheed Technical Operations Co., a unit of Lockheed Corp., was issued a $38.5 million Air Force contract to support space programs and ballistic-missile programs.    Singer Co. got a $23.6 million Air Force contract for F-111 aircraft simulator improvements.    Hawaiian Independent Refinery Inc. was given a $23.4 million Defense Logistics Agency contract for petroleum distillates.    Honeywell Inc. received a $21.1 million Army contract for munitions equipment.    Jaycor was given a $15.3 million Army contract for equipment for operations in adverse nuclear environments.    Textron Lycoming, a unit of Textron Inc., won a $15.1 million Army contract to remanufacture T-53 helicopter engines.    Allied-Signal Inc. received a $14 million Air Force contract for test equipment. </TEXT></DOC>
