Mr. Darman told domestic agencies that their budgetrequests for the year that begins Oct. 1, 1992, should beabout 5% below preliminary estimates printed in theadministration's budget in February.</LP><TEXT>   Last year's budget law sets a ceiling both on budgetauthority, which is roughly the amount of money in anagency's checking account, and on outlays, which is theamount of money actually dispersed. Budget authority grantedthis year, in some cases, will lead to higher outlays infiscal 1993, and that leaves little room for additionalspending under the spending ceilings.   &quot;As a practical matter, the . . . caps get tighter andtighter,&quot; Mr. Darman said in a brief memo to heads of allagencies and departments. Although agencies must submit their1993 budget requests by Sept. 3, final decisions won't bemade until December or January. The president's 1993 budgetwill be released in February.   The budget office earlier this week projected a budgetdeficit of $348.3 billion in 1992 and $245.7 billion in 1993,even if the spending caps are met.</TEXT></DOC>
