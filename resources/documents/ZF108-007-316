 A yearlater, the products have all improved but the CASE industry has not comeclose to meeting its outrageously optimistic sales projections.andP;  Indeed,although CASE is increasingly common, many users resist it or do notunderstand what it can accomplish for them.andP;  Many issues--some technical,most not--have slowed CASE's adoption.andP;  Suffice it to say that the big boomin CASE is yet to come.andM;The tools examined this year differ from last year's in several ways.andP;  Wehave decided not to examine simple diagramming tools, dropping products suchas Have Tree's EasyFlow and Optima's Brackets from the test software.andO;Instead, we concentrated on full CASE products: those that provide a completediagramming, analysis, and reporting system.andM;Although several of last year's manufacturers chose not to participate inthis year's review, we have added some new products to the lineup: EasyCASEPlus, MicroSTEP, and POSE.andM;Testing for this review was conducted by a team of programmers, analysts, andCASE consultants.andP;  With one exception, we implemented two complete testsystems with each CASE product.andP;  The first was a simple tracking system forrouting courier packages and tracking the courier, the contents, and thebilling.andP;  The second was a large manufacturing process involving severaldepartments, dozens of people, and a complex link of responsibilities.andP;  Eachproduct was used by at least two reviewers and their assessments discussedwith others.andP;  The reference test equipment was a Dell 325 with 150MB disk,8MB RAM, and VGA graphics.andM;All products were tested against several evaluation criteria.andP;  Documentationwas rated for completeness, legibility, ease of reading, content, and overallquality.andP;  The product as a whole was rated for presentation and production.andO;The software was rated for installation, ease of understanding and use,completeness, and capability.andP;  All ratings were arrived at subjectively bythe lead tester for each product, but a consensus on all products was reachedand any anomalies thoroughly covered.andM;Evergreen SoftwareandM;EasyCASE PlusandM;EasyCASE Plus provides an impressive number of CASE functions at a veryreasonable price.andP;  EasyCase Plus is supplied on a single diskette.andP;  It runson any PC system and requires 640K of RAM.andP;  It supports Hercules, EGA, andVGA adapters.andP;  A Microsoft or compatible mouse is required.andP;  Printer supportis very good.andP;  A sizable collection of fonts can be used with laser printersand the HP Deskjet series.andM;The manual is spiral-bound and divided into two parts.andP;  It is easy to read,and leads the user through the use of EasyCASE Plus readily.andM;EasyCASE Plus supports dataflow diagrams (DFDs) using either Yourdon-DeMarcoor Gane andamp; Sarson methodologies.andP;  Transformation diagrams with Ward-Mellor andHatley-Pirbhai real-time extensions can be created, as can state-transitiondiagrams.andP;  Yourdon-Constantine and Page-Jones structure charts, Jacksondata-structure diagrams, and Chen entity-relationship diagrams are also partof the system.andM;EasyCASE Plus is based on a data dictionary that contains the details on allelements in a design.andP;  The data-dictionary manager has the tools needed tomaintain a design and help the user manipulate it.andM;The drawing system used with EasyCASE Plus lets the analyst or designer use asix-page drawing surface, which can be exported to a variety of printers andplotters.andP;  A number of zoom steps allow details to be examined or the wholeproject to be seen.andP;  Multiple levels are supported to a maximum depth of 16.andO;Methodology rule-checking of full diagram-object associations is notperformed.andM;The EasyCASE Plus environment is a series of pop-up dialogue boxes andselection menus.andP;  The screen may seem cluttered at times (we were reminded ofthe AutoCAD screen layout), but it is laid out in a thoughtful manner and iseasy to navigate with a mouse.andM;EasyCASE Plus allows information in the data dictionary and chart objects tobe exported to (and imported from) dBASE III Plus files and any SDFfile-format software.andP;  Chart fragments can be exported to desktop publishingand paint programs.andM;We were up and running with EasyCASE Plus in a matter of minutes.andP;  EasyCASEPlus is simple to learn, very simple to install, and easy to use.andP;  While itlacks the power and features of some of the larger systems, it's a lot ofproduct for a very low price.andM;Index Technology Corp.andM;Excelerator v. 1.9andM;Excelerator is one of the big names in CASE tools.andP;  The latest release, v.andO;1.9, continues in the excellent tradition of the earlier versions.andO;Excelerator provides the tools to perform powerful CASE analysis.andM;Excelerator requires a minimum of 470K free RAM.andP;  It supports EGA, VGA, andHercules graphics adapters.andP;  At least 10MB of hard disk space is required.andO;Printers and plotters are supported over a good range of models.andP;  A LANversion is available for all popular LAN systems.andP;  A mouse is required.andM;Excelerator is copy-protected, requiring a hardware key for either serial orparallel ports.andP;  If the key is not available, the system will not operate.andO;The block is a pass-through device and provided no problems in our testing.andM;The Excelerator documentation comes in several manuals and small booklets.andO;The manuals are dedicated to an application guide and two reference guides.andO;A spiral-bound tutorial manual provides a complete introduction to thesystem.andP;  The booklets refer to enhancements that may occur between largemanual printings and cover installation.andP;  Excelerator's documentation isexcellent and should be used as a model for others.andM;Excelerator provides a powerful data-flow diagramming system as well as aprocess-model module.andP;  Both Gane andamp; Sarson and Yourdon and DeMarcomethodologies are supported with the diagrammer.andP;  The models are tied to adata dictionary, and the entire system can be validated as it is designed.andO;The dictionary is easy to use and the manager provides many tools.andM;Prototyping various aspects of the model, including outputs, lets usersrapidly develop a complete model.andP;  Throughout the development cycle, reportsand summaries can be produced at will.andM;It is difficult to do justice to Excelerator by describing just itscomponents.andP;  It is much more than the sum of a few CASE tools.andP;  Exceleratorprovides a complete environment for the development and analysis of complexprojects, yet is still simple and fast to use.andP;  Excelerator is easy to learnand has a good graphics interface.andP;  The tutorial provides a fast way tobecome proficient in a few hours.andP;  The new provision for color is welcome.andM;Excelerator is a joy to use, and all of our reviewers were very pleased withthe new version.andP;  The documentation is superb.andP;  Although newer, flashiersystems are now available, Excelerator continues be the standard againstwhich others are judged.andM;LBMSandM;Auto-Mate PlusandM;Auto-Mate Plus requires an 80286 or higher machine with 640K of RAM.andP;  Thetest version was supplied on 12 5-1/4-inch diskettes.andP;  Twelve megabytes ofdisk space are required for the full system.andP;  Auto-Mate Plus supports VGA,EGA, CGA, Hercules, and ATandamp;T color adapters.andM;Auto-Mate Plus is copy-protected, with a counter for the number ofinstallations.andP;  To reinstall a system, the old copy must be removed.andP;  Onlyone installation is allowed per copy, so a disk crash can ruin the productuntil replacement diskettes are obtained.andM;The documentation comes in two binders covering three volumes of material.andO;The documentation printing is not impressive, appearing as though it wasphotocopied from larger sheets to fit the standard-size binder.andP;  In contentit is comprehensive and sometimes reads like reference material.andM;Auto-Mate Plus uses its own methodology called LSDM/AM.andP;  A wide range oftools is included.andP;  It allows logical data structure diagrams with fullyentity relationships and data-dictionary use, DFDs with multiple levels anddatabase support, interrelationships between the DFDs and LDSs, logicaltransaction systems, and partial prototyping capabilities.andM;Logical design capabilities provide full relational data analysis andnormalization, logic and error handling, and entity life history definition.andO;The picture editor for the LDS is easy to use and quick to learn.andP;  The manualprovides a short tutorial on its use with a sample system.andM;The Auto-Mate Plus picture editor is used for all the diagramming functionsthe package supports.andP;  It is well-thought-out and easy to learn.andP;  It offersconsiderable power for selecting picture elements.andM;The proprietary methodology is similar in concept to traditional techniques,but it has a few twists.andP;  It must be learned to allow proper use of theAuto-Mate Plus system.andP;  One section of the manual provides a discussion ofthe methodology.andM;One attractive feature of Auto-Mate Plus is its ability to integrate withcommercial DBMSs, including Adabas, DB2, and Oracle.andP;  When a system has beenfully designed with Auto-Mate Plus, add-on modules can be used to generate anapplication and database structure rapidly.andP;  The review copy did not includethese modules, so we could not assess their quality.andM;Auto-Mate Plus is not a simple package.andP;  You can get the picture editor goingfairly quickly, but getting the most out of the system requires substantialtime devoted to exploring its unique features.andM;Once we learned it, Auto-Mate Plus proved completely capable of handling anyproject we threw at it.andP;  The unusual methodology required some work tounderstand and relate to the more common methods, but it worked well.andP;  Theproduct should offer a choice of methodology, allowing the user to decide howto manage the system.andP;  The copy protection is annoying and can be aconsiderable deterrent under some conditions.andM;All in all, though, Auto-Mate Plus is a powerful product.andP;  Users willing tolearn the underlying methodology will have a solid base with which to work.andM;Syscorp International Inc.andM;MicroSTEPandM;MicroSTEP provides a unique feature: it generates completed applications fromthe user's design.andP;  It uses a graphics-oriented specification language toguide users through the process.andM;The MicroSTEP system is provided on six 5-1/4-inch diskettes.andP;  MicroSTEPrequires 640K RAM and 6MB of disk space.andP;  A mouse is also required.andP;  OnlyHercules and EGA video modes are supported.andM;The documentation includes three different manuals (all different sizes andshapes).andP;  A spiral-bound tutorial provides an easy introduction to the entiresystem, guiding the user through all stages of a design process.andP;  Thetutorial is well-written and easy to follow.andP;  A training manual providescourse material.andP;  While much of it repeats the tutorial, it may be ideal forlarge organizations.andM;A reference manual contained in a thick, three-ring binder rounds out theset.andP;  The manual is printed in a large font, which may annoy some usersbecause of the small amount of information per page.andP;  In addition, the manualis often silly: telling users how to push the button on a mouse (with adiagram) seems redundant, Admittedly, even a complete neophyte can learn touse the system with this baby-talk approach.andP;  But we suspect many will notlike it.andP;  Software development is still generally performed by grownups.andM;To define a system with MicroSTEP, the application is described using adata-flow diagram.andP;  The diagramming system is fairly typical, providing apoint-and-shoot environment for the objects in the diagram.andP;  Each item in thediagram is described in a data dictionary.andP;  Output screens and reports theapplication employs are described in a similar manner.andM;Data flow and logic flow are described, and the flow of each piece ofinformation is well-documented.andP;  Once this is completed, the system generatesa complete C program file from the definitions.andM;The diagramming and data dictionary sections of MicroSTEP are well-conceivedand easy to use.andP;  They have considerable power that is not immediatelyobvious, although they are not as powerful or flexible as some of the morecomplete CASE tools.andM;We certainly can't complain about the product's ability to generateexecutable programs directly from a specification.andP;  However, MicroSTEP lacksa rigid methodology and does not allow users to do much more than follow theapproved process step by step.andM;We found it very easy to use; it was almost trivial to design programs,model, and create our sample.andP;  MicroSTEP is a unique product and certainlyuseful.andP;  We're just not sure it's really a CASE tool.andM;Computer Systems AdvisersandM;POSEandM;POSE is an acronym for Picture-Oriented Software Engineering.andP;  This imposingtitle finds its referent in an imposing product: a modular CASE tool thatdepends heavily on a graphics-oriented interface.andP;  POSE can be used for bothprocess- and data-driven system analysis.andM;POSE comprises nine modules: data-model diagrammer and normalizer; logicaldatabase designer; database aid; data-flow, structure-chart, decomposition,and action-chart diagrammers; and a screen report prototyper.andP;  All POSEmodules are integrated with a common data dictionary.andP;  Each isself-contained, with its own package, disks, and manuals.andM;POSE requires at least 512K of RAM, DOS 3.0 or higher, a hard disk, mouse,and a CGA or EGA monitor.andP;  If the full POSE system is to be installed, 10MBof disk space is required.andP;  Individual modules may be installed as required,but a minimum of 2MB-3MB should be available.andM;POSE has a copy-protected system diskette that allows two installations to beperformed.andP;  If the system is to be removed, the system disk must be used toavoid destroying the count of installations.andM;The entire POSE system is packaged in nine clamshell boxes (like oversizedVCR shell boxes).andP;  Each opens to show a diskette packet on the left, with oneto five disks per module and two manuals on the right (a tutorial and areference guide).andP;  The manuals are about as big as paperback books.andM;POSE uses extensive pull-down and pop-up menus.andP;  The system is consistentacross the modules and easy to learn.andP;  (Tutorials for each module guide usersthrough sample applications.)andP;  When coupled with an EGA monitor, the graphicsapproach of the system provides a level of hand-holding that can't beachieved by other systems.andM;The data-model diagrammer module allows a graphical representation of asystem to be generated.andP;  DMD will then analyze the system for keys,redundancies, and associations between data elements.andM;Models are created by specifying the name and a description on an identifierscreen.andP;  Objects (diagram parts or entities, associations, and attached text)are selected from a pull-down menu.andM;The data modeling module provides up to 1,000 entities per model, with 1,000associations per model (up to 100 per entity).andP;  Models cannot be combined forconsistency checks on larger (or separated) models.andP;  A maximum of 50 modelsis supported within the POSE framework.andM;The data model normalizer module of POSE is closely linked to the DMD moduleand provides the capability to normalize attributes of related entities.andM;The logical database designer module provides a tool to create a transactionusage map that outlines all data accesses in a system.andP;  This permits theperformance of a particular transaction to be traced through a complex systemand checked for consistency and logic.andP;  Using this tool, transactions can beexamined in detail to ensure they are handled optimally.andM;The database aid allows a model that has been created with the DMD system(and is logically correct) to be translated into a target DBMS under SQL.andO;DBA provides an error-checking system for the SQL conversion, with any errorsresulting in reworking of the DMD.andP;  If conversion is completed successfully,schema statements are generated.andP;  An export option provides an ASCII versionof the code, which can be read by mot DBMSs and used to create the physicaldatabase directly.andM;The screen report prototyper is a utility for screen design, data entrylayout, and menu screen creation in a demonstration environment.andP;  These canall be linked together into a full prototype system.andM;The data-flow diagrammer module lets you create process and DFDs.andP;  Gane andamp;Sarson symbolism is employed.andP;  Diagrams are created with a series ofpull-down menus that permit interrelationships between entities to be drawnand explained textually.andP;  Consistency checking is supported.andM;The levels of the DFDs can be expanded in parent-child fashion, with detailsof particular systems visible when the child is selected.andP;  Using this withthe zoom feature to show different levels of a large diagram permits verydetailed flow diagrams to be created that are easily simplified as the focusis pulled from detail to generic.andM;The structure chart diagrammer uses the Yourdon-Constantine technique topresent charts of modules and their interfaces with consistency checking.andP;  Aswith the other diagramming modules, the creation of a structure chart isaccomplished via pull-down menus and pop-up data windows.andM;The decomposition diagrammer provides a diagram of functional breakdowns interms of processes, work, and organization.andP;  The action chart diagrammerprovides another method of drawing program logic.andP;  It is paticularly usefulfor systems that do not stand up to consistency checks of a rigidmethodology.andM;The POSE system's highly graphics-oriented interface has many advantages,including consistency across modules and ease of learning.andP;  POSE has a numberof rough edges too, including its lousy installation routine, copyprotection, and limited printer support.andP;  Despite these complaints, weenjoyed using POSE.andP;  We learned it quickly and went right on to use it fordeveloping models.andM;Scandura Intelligent SystemsandM;ProdocandM;Prodoc is an interesting product, and we debated whether to include it inthis review.andP;  Scandura claims Prodoc is a CASE tool, but in this case &quot;CASE&quot;stands for Cognitive Approach to System Engineering, according to thedocumentation.andP;  It generates source code for C, Pascal, and ADA compilersfrom user specifications.andP;  The documentation makes extensive references tothe ease with which software can be reverse-engineered with Prodoc.andM;Prodoc requires 640K of memory and supports Quarterdeck's DESQviewenvironment.andP;  The Prodoc software is delivered on nin 5-1/4-inch diskettes ina standard-size binder with the hardware key.andP;  The key is for parallel portuse only and must be present for operation of the software.andP;  The keyfunctioned well in most of our tests, but some reviewers commented on strangeeffects on the pass-through under some conditions.andM;Prodoc's documentation is poor.andP;  The manual is spiral-bound with two pagesshrunk down and printed side-by-side on both sides of the paper, making forawkward reading.andP;  The review copy was accompanied by loose-leaf versions oftwo addenda tucked in the manual.andM;Prodoc employs a proprietary methodology to let users diagram a system.andO;Sentences are used to described the specification, which are rewritten intoan implementation diagram.andP;  At this point, existing code in ADA, C, COBOL,FORTRAN, or Pascal can be imported.andP;  From this the program generates sourcecode.andP;  The generated source code need not be in the language imported, thusthe strength of this tool in reverse-engineering.andP;  The methodology encouragestop-down design and uses pseudocode extensively.andM;The Prodoc system is composed of several modules, each dedicated to adifferent purpose.andP;  These include system configuration, flow diagramming,simulation, prototyping, report generation, reverse-engineering, andtranslation.andM;To use Prodoc users must learn the methodology, which is a curious crossbetween many others yet singular.andP;  It took our testers a while to understandthe concepts and become familiar with the system.andP;  It certainly is not CASEby any of our definitions, but the product does allow generation of programsfrom specifications.andM;We found the Prodoc learning curve steep, especially considering thedocumentation.andP;  However, once we understood the system, we managed to producecomplete code for simple applications.andP;  We were not able to use it for largeprojects and did not attempt to analyze our large test project with thesystem.andM;Prodoc will certainly fill a niche for some users.andP;  Those who are not lockedinto rigid methodologies and are looking for quick way to generate code fromsystem descriptions will find it a useful product.andP;  We consider it a curiousanomaly and wish Scandura would rewrite the documentation!andM;Cadre TEchnologies Inc.andM;TeamWorkandM;Team Work is a set of modules that provide a complete set of CASE tools.andP;  Itallows analysis using information-modeling and system-analysis procedures, aswell as design work using a system-design routine.andP;  Project management andintegration are handled by another set of tools.andP;  Release 3.0.3 for OS/2 wasused for this review.andM;The OS/2 version of TeamWork requires a PS/2 system with VGA and 5MB of RAM.andO;A mouse is necessary.andP;  At least 7.5MB of hard disk should be available.andO;TeamWork uses a block device that attaches to the parallel port.andP;  It wastransparent in all the tests we performed.andM;The teamWork documentation occupies four binders.andP;  The entire set wouldrequire only one-and-a-half binders, but it has been divided into logicalunits, each devoted to a particular subject or module.andP;  The documentation isvery well-written, with excellent production quality and plenty of examples.andM;The TeamWork system is composed of an environment module that acts as thecentral core around which the other modules work:andM;* The TeamWork/IM module provides an information-modeling system fordefinition of entities, relationships, and attributes of data.andP;  This moduleworks at a conceptual level.andM;* The TeamWork/SA module deals with system analysis and allows quick, fulldefinition of a system.andP;  This module includes validation routines andcompleteness validation.andM;* The TeamWork/RT module provides real-time modeling capabilities and worksin connection with the system-analysis module to provide real timeextensions.andM;* TeamWork/SD provides structured analysis tools.andP;  Other modules are includedfor different environments, when applicable, such as for VMS or Apolloworkstations.andM;Each TeamWork module works alone yet functions through the environment moduleas an integrated package.andP;  The environment provides basic tools such as thepicture editor, file handling, and other editors that are common to more thanone module.andM;TeamWork uses windows extensively, with pull-down menus and dialogue boxes.andO;The graphical interface is easy to use and quite pleasant.andP;  TeamWork was easyto learn: the documentation was well-written and guided us through the use ofthe product quite well.andM;TeamWork was easy to work with.andP;  We completed our test models in record time.andO;All reviewers were pleased with the system.andP;  The requirement of 5MB of RAMmay faze some, but this product is well presented, easy to work with, andproduces its results in fine format.andM;Visible Systems Corp.andM;Visible Analyst WorkbenchandM;The Visible Analyst Workbench is a set of four tools.andP;  It is a comprehensive,simple-to-use CASE tool that can be assimilated rapidly.andM;Visibly Analyst Workbench is provided on five 5-1/4-inch floppies, or on3-1/2-inch disks.andP;  It will work on any PC, although 80286 and 80386 machinesprovide better performance.andP;  RAM requirements depend on the tools used.andP;  Ingeneral, a 640K-RAM machine should be used.andM;Visible Analyst Workbench supports most serial and bus mice.andP;  It fullysupports CGA, Hercules, and EGA graphics.andP;  Printer support is not extensive,but those supported cover the majority of the market.andM;A LAN version of Visible Analyst Workbench is available for Novell AdvancedNetware.andP;  A single copy of Visible Analyst Workbench supports an unlimitednumber of users with proper management capabilities.andM;The documentation is included in a single binder and is divided into the fourbasic parts of the product.andP;  Each is well-explained, and the manual is easyto read.andP;  Examples are included in several places for illustration.andM;Visible Analyst Workbench consists of a mouse-driven diagramming module, astructured methodology addition to the diagramming system, a databasemanagement system, and a prototyper/simulator.andP;  All four modules build on theothers, allowing progressive design and use.andM;The Visible Analyst module is a mouse-driven graphics package.andP;  It allows theuser to create free-form diagrams with no restrictions on methodology or rulesystems.andP;  A menu provides standard symbols, lines, and templates, and usersare free to create their own with a custom symbol generator that allows newsymbols to become an integral part of the product.andP;  Full menu editing is aavailable and the system supports up to 600 diagrams in a single project.andM;The visible Rules module adds structured methodology to the Visible Analyst.andO;It provides Yourdon-DeMarco and Gane andamp; Sarson methodologies.andP;  A set of designaids provides a system for quickly creating and validating diagrams producedunder either methodology.andP;  Automatic process balancing, and object labelingare all included as standard features.andM;The Visible Dictionary provides a database for identification of allinformation in the design.andP;  When a rigid methodology is used, the dictionaryintegrates completely, allowing considerable flexibility in the creation andmanipulation of the data dictionary.andP;  Diagram changes are automaticallyreflected in the dictionary without user interference.andP;  A report generatorprovides several output formats for summary reports.andM;Finally, the Visible Prototype allows a simulation to be built for anysystem.andP;  It can be used throuhout the development cycle, allowing ad hoctesting of changes or new processes.andP;  The prototype is easy to use and, whenused with the complete Visible Analyst Workbench system, allows validation ofthe design in a short time.andM;Visible analyst Workbench can be configured to a considerable extent by theuser.andP;  A section of the documentation covers this.andP;  a number of utilities arealso included.andM;All of our testers found the Visible Analyst Workbench easy to learn.andP;  Thepackage is integrated very well, and we were able to complete system designsquickly.andP;  The manual's layout and writing style make it easy to read, and itleads the user through the product quite well.andP;  The methodologies are themost popular at the moment and are complete as far as we could tell.andP;  Wefound Visible Analyst Workbench a solid product with no rough edges, andwhile it may lack the bells and whistles of other products, it is a veryuseful tool capable of providing CASE for both novices and experienced users.andM;Picking a CASE productandM;All in all, the CASE market hasn't really changed much in the past year.andO;Although many of the reviewed products are new versions, the underlyingsystem is still the same.andP;  We found our remarks last year to be just anapplicable this year.andP;  The products reviewed here are all capable ofproviding users with the basic tools to complete a CASE analysis.andP;  Auto-MatePlus and Prodoc use their own methodologies, but any of the products canprovide full CASE functions.andM;Our analyses were performed on all the products tested except Prodoc.andP;  Eachhandled them in its own way but performed capably within the framework of thesupplied tools.andP;  On examining our test results, we saw no considerabledifference in the time taken to perform the analyses on any of the products.andM;Choosing the best product is difficult.andP;  EasyCASE has a noticeable advantagein its attractive pricing, but it does not provide all the capabilities ofsome of the others.andP;  Meanwhile, products like Excelerator and TeamWorkcontinue to provide solid, professional tools.andM;Visible Analyst's quarter of modules work well together, but it lacks some ofthe extended capabilities of products like Excelerator.andP;  POSE, with itsgraphical outlook, is certain to please many.andM;Products like MicroSTEP are an interesting extensions of the CASE idea, butthe basic requirement in our minds for a CASE system is not generation ofcomplete programs but the ability to analyze existing large products.andP;  Still,it is certain to appeal to some.andM;Forced to a decision, we concluded that Excelerator remains at the top of thePC CASE pile.andP;  The new version is a welcome extension of the software we gavethe nod to last year.andP;  The Team Work series is without peer for those whohave the hardware firepower, and it is a must for software engineers whomodel real-time embedded systems.andM;Analysts on a budget should consider Visible Analyst, which provides anexcellent set of functions at a fraction of Excelerator's price.andP;  EasyCASE'sbargain-basement price makes it the overall price-performance winner--perfectfor organizations that must equip many engineers with CASE tools or forcompanies who wish to explore but are not yet ready to commit to CASE.andM;Tim Parker is a system programmer in Gloucester, Ont., Canada, who writes forseveral technical magazines.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
