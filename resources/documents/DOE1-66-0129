An off-line control simulates the ideal ignitionangle control the impact of which is then tested with the help of onepart of the ECE-test process. For the first time the results of the formercan be solved with the highly-efficient data logger which also allowsto take the problem of dispersion within the combustion process fromone cycle to the next into account. The position of the maximum combustionpressure {alpha}/sub pmax/ is used as an indicator for combustion efficiency.This optimation improves consumption by between 1 and 2%. Optimationof combustion in transient state does, however, only to a low degreecontribute to this improved efficiency. The simulation of a continuouscharacteristic value converter carried out by ways of comparison, showsthat changing the operating point of an engine can lead to an increaseof the efficiency potential several times higher than what can be achievedby ignition angle control.
