The changes were pushed through Parliament just five days afterAttorney General Matthew Muli proposed them in the official KenyaGazette.   Clergymen and the Law Society of Kenya opposed the changes,warning that they would weaken constitutional checks and balancesand erode individual liberties.   The changes empower the president to fire a High Court or Courtof Appeals judge without having to go through the current tribunalprocess and without giving a reason.   Parliament also voted to expand from 24 hours to 14 days theperiod in which police can hold a person suspected of a capitaloffense before bringing him to court.   There normally is a 14-day period between the time a bill isproposed and Parliament debates it. But legislators voted Tuesdayto reduce the waiting period for debate on the constitutionalchanges to the elapsed five days.   Joshua Angatia was the only member of the 201, one-chamberlegislature to vote against the procedural change that allowed forthe quick debate and vote.   The bill was read three times, as required by law. Votes weretaken only on the second and third reading.   The vote on the second reading was 151-0 in favor of theconstitutional changes. By the time the third vote was set, moremembers had entered the chamber and the bill passed 160-0.   Kenya, by law, is a one party state and the approval of theconstitutional changes had been expected.   Tuesday's bill was the 10th amendment to the constitution since1969.   In December 1986, Parliament amended the constitution to removetenure for the offices of attorney general and auditor-general.   Lawyers and clergymen fought against those changes, saying theyreduced the independence of the attorney general and theauditor-general.   The constitution was written in 1969 to update a bulky 1963independence constitution which had become cumbersome because ofnumerous amendments.</TEXT></DOC>
