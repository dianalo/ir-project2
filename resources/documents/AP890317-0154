But knowledgeable Israeli sources said one soldier was killed andanother wounded in the 10 p.m. attack. They said on condition ofanonymity that the guerrillas apparently crossed the border backinto Jordan.   An army spokesman said an initial report showed the guerrillascrossed into Israel near the southern border communal farm of EinYahav, 74 miles south of Jerusalem.   Two Israeli soldiers were wounded in the ensuing firefight, thespokesman said. He said no details were available.   One soldier who was shot and slightly wounded in the arm wastreated at the Soroka Hospital in the southern town of Beersheva,hospital spokeswoman Tami Lunenfeld said.   On Wednesday, two Palestinian guerrillas slipped across border inthe occupied Gaza Strip town of Rafah and hurled a grenade at anarmy outpost. The guerrillas were captured by Israeli troops. Therewere no Israeli casualties.   On Friday, one of the guerrillas, 18-year-old Iman MohammedHassan Yunis from the Canada refugee camp on the Egyptian side ofRafah, said he has been operating on orders from Yasser Arafat'sFatah wing of the PLO.   Wednesday's raid was the first attempted infiltration attributedto Fatah since Arafat in December renounced terrorism and recognizedIsrael's right to exist. After Arafat's statements, the UnitedStates launched a dialogue with the PLO.   U.S. officials reportedly have sought to work out a cease-firebetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization to stopinfiltrations from Lebanon. The PLO claims these are attacks onmilitary targets that are not included in Arafat's renunciation ofterrorism.   Army officials say at least 30 guerrillas have been killed insouthern Lebanon this year while attempting to cross into Israel.Five were killed in two attempts this week.   The last infiltration from Jordan was on May 17, 1988. One Arabguerrilla was wounded and captured, and two escaped during that raid.</TEXT></DOC>
