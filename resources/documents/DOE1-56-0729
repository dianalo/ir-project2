The most frequent cause of the X-ray change in theshape of the mediastinum was a lipoma which usually showed a characteristicimage. In one case the lipoma was accompanied by relatively high densityvalues within the region of -50 to +40 H, in which case the lipoma wasamply vascularized. The thymolipoma was extremely large and in the CTimage showed a denser thymus remnant along the edge of the adipose tissue.A hyperdense area in the adipose tissue always arouses suspicion of malignity.In the differential diagnosis, omental hernias are important which havetypical hyperdense strips with higher density due to omental blood vessels.Lipomatosis of the mediastinum affects both the upper and the lower mediastinum,and/or subphrenic spaces and is characterized by the general proliferationof adipose tisue.</TEXT></DOC>
