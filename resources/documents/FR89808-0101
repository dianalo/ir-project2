Soles, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Executive Director, U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program.</ITAG>The mission of the United States Man and the Biosphere Program (U.S. MAB)is to foster harmonious relationships between humans and the biospherethrough an international program of policy-relevant research which integratessocial, physical and biological sciences to address actual problems. Theseactivities_broadly interpreted_include catalytic conferences and meetings,education and training, and the establishment and use of biosphere reservesas research and monitoring sites. The U.S. National Committee for U.S. MAB hereby announces its prioritiesand criteria for the selection of original research proposals and projectsto receive U.S. MAB support in fiscal year 1990, contingent upon the availabilityof funds. Scientists are encouraged to collaborate in developing new interdisciplinaryproposals and to seek complementary funds from other sources. Proposedresearch and projects, such as symposia, workshops or other activitieswhich further the U.S. MAB objectives, may be spread over several years.Proposed workshop activities must be especially innovative to merit consideration.Interested scientists should write to the U.S. MAB Secretariat to receivecopies of the U.S. MAB Directorate Mission Statements on:andbullet; High Latitude Ecosystems;andbullet; Human Dominated Systems; andbullet; Marine and Coastal Ecosystems; andbullet; Temperate Ecosystems; and andbullet; Tropical Ecosystems.Abstracts of these Mission Statements will be published in the August 1989issue of the <T3>U.S. MAB Bulletin </T3>and in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Proposals must first be submitted as a prospectus with a maximum lengthof two pages. U.S. MAB will not pay overhead fees on grants. Consideration will only be given to proposals which are inter or transdisciplinaryand concentrate on at least one of the following:andbullet; biological diversity, andbullet; global climate and ecological change, andbullet; sustainable/integrated development.Preference will be given to proposals which:andbullet; request $50,000 or less; andbullet; when international, involve scientists from the host country;and andbullet; deal with environmental policy issues, especially those relevantto agencies which support U.S. MAB.Prospectuses may not exceed two pages and must be accompanied by a summarybiographic sketch of the potential principal(s) which include exceptionalqualifications and lists any relevant publications. The bibliographic sketchof each principal may not exceed two (2) pages. The prospectuses must alsobe accompanied by a cover sheet clearly indicating how the potential proposalmeets the above stated requisite criteria. Mail prospectuses to: U.S. MAB Secretariat, OES/ENR/MAB, U.S. Departmentof State, Washington, DC 20520. No prospectus will be accepted after November 6, 1989. Prospectuses willbe subject to an administrative review for adherence to the requirementslisted and will be returned without review if deficiencies are found. The U.S. MAB Secretariat will distribute prospectuses to the appropriateU.S. MAB Directorate. Individual Directorates will review the prospectusesbased on responsiveness to this call, relevancy of the proposed activityto their mission statements, and the performance competence of the proposedprincipal(s) as evidenced by the summary biographic sketch. Directorateswill review all prospectuses by December 15, 1989. Prospectuses favorably reviewed by a Directorate will be forwarded to theU.S. National Committee for MAB for further review at the January 1990National Committee meeting. The National Committee will review the prospectusesfor their relevance to the U.S. MAB program priorities. The National Committeewill then determine which principals will be invited to submit a full proposal.The U.S. National Committee at its own initiative may request that additionalproposals on specific subjects be submitted for review and consideration.Complete project and research proposals must be received by the U.S. MABSecretariat by close of business May 1, 1990. Proposal texts may not exceed25 pages, double-spaced, including a two page executive summary describingthe objective of the proposed effort and the method of approach. If proposed project activities are international in scope, the proposalmust provide written evidence that host country permissions have alreadybeen obtained to carry out the project. All proposals must contain: (1) Clearly defined objectives; (2) a feasiblework plan to achieve those objectives within the time frame and resourcesof the grant; and (3) specified products which will result from the grant.Proposals must identify one individual for contract purposes and specifyone institution to receive and sub-allocate funds for the proposed activities.Proposals will be subject to an administrative review for adherence tolisted requirements and if deficiencies are found, will be returned withoutfurther consideration. Appropriate U.S. MAB Directorate and peer reviewers, including disciplinespecialists in the areas of the proposals, will be selected by U.S. MABto evaluate and rate the proposals on the basis of their intrinsic scientificmerit and intellectual focus, and on their potential to increase scientificunderstanding and provide the basis for policy development by U.S MAB'ssupporting agencies. Directorates and peer reviewers will also consider,in their overall assessments of the proposals, the performance competenceof the principals and the adequacy of the requested resources to accomplishthe stated objectives. A final ranking of the proposals received will be made by the U.S. NationalCommittee for the Man in the Biosphere Program based on all of the abovefactors and their assessment of each proposal's relevancy to the goalsof U.S. MAB. Proposals will then be funded in the order of their assignedrank and based on available funds. Prinicipals will receive copies of all peer review evaluations made oftheir proposal and a written notification of the Committee's decision ontheir project. Winning proposals become part of the public domain. Proposalsnot selected for funding by the National Committee will be returned tothe authors. The National Committee will notify all principals of its final decisionsin August 1990. Funds will be committed to the managing institutions identifiedin the selected proposals by September 30, 1990.   Agencies involved with the U.S. MAB Program: Department of State, Agencyfor International Development, USDA Forest Service, National Park Service,National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Peace Corps, NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Environmental Protection Agencyand the Smithsonian Institution.<ITAG tagnum="84">Abstracts of Directorates Mission Statements</ITAG>High-Latitude Ecosystems<ITAG tagnum="81">Background</ITAG>High-latitude regions of the earth include the zones of continuous anddiscontinuous permafrost in North America and Eurasia, and the cold-dominatedecosystems at lower latitudes such as the Aleutian Peninsula. Circumpolarhigh-latitude regions include some of the most undeveloped land areas ofthe northern hemisphere. These regions support indigenous human populationswhich until very recently have been practicing a relatively stable subsistencelifestyle. Now, however, these regions are undergoing rapidly acceleratingsocial change, including increasing pressure for resource extraction, growingresident populations as a result of population migration from lower latitudes,and, concurrently, increased scrutiny of resource use and decisions concerningtheir management.The circumpolar high-latitude regions encompass a multiplicity of ecosystemsincluding arctic tundra, alpine tundra, cold deserts, subartic taiga forests,urbanized settings, freshwater systems and estuaries and coastal and marinesystems.<ITAG tagnum="81">Mission Statement</ITAG>The mission of the High-Latitude Ecosystems Directorate of the United StatesMan and the Biosphere program is to foster mutually supportive relationshipsbetween humans and the biosphere in high-latitude ecosystems through aprogram of research and projects which integrate social, physical and biologicalsciences in addressing actual problems on which to base recommendationsto policymakers.Among the areas for concentrated project activities and proposed researchare:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Sustainable resource management and cultural development;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Monitoring of global climatic change, implications for biologicalproductivity, engineering works and transportation systems, and residenthuman populations;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Maintaining aquatic areas and wetlands;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Maintaining and protecting biological diversity;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Cooperation in research and policy development to recover any ofthe above that are lost or are in the process of being damaged.</ITAG>N.B. A decision was made by the U.S. National Committee to establish aDirectorate for Human Dominated Systems rather than for Human Settlementsin order for U.S. MAB to be able to support projects and activities overa broader range of problems.Human Dominated Systems<ITAG tagnum="81">Background</ITAG>There are many circumstances in which human activity has so profoundlyaltered the underlying ecosystems that a very different environment iscreated. Present day population growth levels have caused such ecosystemalteration more rapidly and over wider areas than ever before, resultingin urbanization and intensification of agriculture that present tremendousproblems for human health and continued food production. Other processes,such as mining and resource extraction, and tourist developments also createaltered and distinct ecologies dominated by humans. Many of these areassuffer from severe problems arising from the collapse of ecological lifesupport systems, such as severe air pollution in cities, soil degradationand tropical deforestation in relation to agriculture, and the loss ofbeaches and coastal areas due to the expansion of various kinds of development.As a result, the capacity of natural systems, and the viability of varioustypes of human interventions need to be better understood.<ITAG tagnum="81">Mission Statement</ITAG>The mission of the Human-Dominated Systems Directorate of the U.S. Manand the Biosphere Program is to foster interdisciplinary research on theproblems arising from human activity that profoundly modify or dominateunderlying ecosystems and related life support systems. This program willintegrate social, physical and biological sciences in providing informationand research results in addressing actual problems on which to base recommendationsto policymakers.The research needed to address the issues arising in connection with humanactivities that overwhelm or threaten to overwhelm natural ecosystems andtheir life support functions will focus not on defined geographical areas,but on areas in which dense aggregations of people occur or where naturalsystems have been profoundly altered by purposeful human manipulation.Such research would include:andbullet; Identifying levels or intensity of activity that can be supportedwithout causing the collapse of life support systems essential to the activity,e.g. agriculture, or urban development;andbullet; Identifying key factors that can be manipulated and those thancannot without detrimental effect, e.g. major controllable variables causingthe greenhouse effect, its origins and the effects of various control methods;andbullet; Addressing the major pollution issues facing urban settlements,identifying both immediate health effects or indirect effects such as groundwaterpollution, chemical run-off or atmospheric pollution/climate change; andbullet; Identifying and analyzing methods for reintegrating natural functionsinto modified ecosystems so as to restore or support important life-supportsystems; andbullet; Analyzing human decision-making processes as they relate to resourceand ecosystem management, and methods for improving integration of ecosystemconsiderations in such decisionmaking; and andbullet; Analyzing how the stress resulting from deteriorating environmentimpacts upon human beings. Marine and Coastal Ecosystems <ITAG tagnum="81">Background </ITAG>The coastal zones of the world, the region of terrestrial-marine convergence,constitute an area equal to the African continent and contain most of themarine resources used by humans. Growing problems of marine pollution,habitat degradation and biological impoverishment are found in a numberof the world's poorly mixed coastal waters, especially those associatedwith population centers, industrial activity and river inputs. <ITAG tagnum="81">Mission Statement </ITAG>The mission of the Marine and Coastal Ecosystems Directorate of the UnitedStates Man and the Biosphere Program is to foster mutually supportive relationshipbetween humans and the biosphere in coastal and marine ecosystems througha program of research and projects which integrate social, physical andbiolgical sciences in addressing problems on which to base recommendationsto policymakers. The Directorate will encourage research and project activities on the biolgeographyof marine and coastal ecosystems, including their influences on and interdependencieswith human activities and well-being. The areas of concentrated project activities and proposed research are:andbullet; Monitoring of sources and quantity of pollution; andbullet; Rising sea level; andbullet; Planned marine disposal; andbullet; Preservation of traditional uses of ocean space; andbullet; Eutrophication in coastal areas andbullet; Sedimentation; andbullet; Red tides and harmful blooms. Tropical Ecosystems <ITAG tagnum="81">Background </ITAG>Dramatic changes in land-use have had enormous consequences to the maintenanceand quality of life of people in the tropical latitutdes. The magnitudeof the change is affecting the biological diversity of the planet, causinglosses of precious genetic material, changing the chemistry and compositionof the oceans and the atmosphere, seriously depleting the fertility ofsoils and nature's ability to replenish that fertility, changing the climateof the world and greatly influencing the biogeo-chemical cycles of theplanet. Therefore, the overriding issues facing governments, researchers,resource managers, local communities, and resource users in the tropicsare: how can we stem the tide of negative global change and protect theworld's biological diversity; while also providing conditions supportiveof the growth and developoment of social systems needed to maintain a healthyhuman population. <ITAG tagnum="81">Mission Statement </ITAG>The mission of the Tropical Ecosystems Directorate of the United StatesMan and the Biosphere Program is to foster mutually supportive relationshipbetween humans and the biosphere in tropical ecosystems through a programof research and projects which integrate social, physical sciences in addressingactural problems on which to base recommendations to policy makers. Among the research and project activities that will form the focus of thetropical directorate are: andbullet; Tropical forest restoration;andbullet; Producing management plans that outline the steps for restoringlandscapes, fresh water systems or grazing lands;andbullet; Improving communication between social and natural scientistsor managers who are working on the conservation of tropical ecosystems;and andbullet; Generating data bases which contain available solutions to theproblems of natural resourceTemperate Ecosystem<ITAG tagnum="81">Background</ITAG>The Temperate Zone is occupied by the most industrialized nations and containsabout two-thirds of the earth's population. Consequently, human activitieshave had substantial impacts on natural ecosystems as well as on globalecological processes. The per capital rate of resource consumption andpollution are far higher in the temperate zone than in other zones, andmodification to natural ecosystems is extensive.<ITAG tagnum="81">Mission Statement</ITAG>The mission of the Temperate Ecosystem Directorate of the United StatesMan and the Biosphere Program is to foster mutually supportive relationshipsbetwen humans and the biosphere in temperate ecosystems through a programof research and projects which integrate social, physical and biologicalsciences in addressing actual problems on which to base recommendationsto policymakers.Among the problem areas that will provide the focus of the directorateprogram are:andbullet; Human modification of ecosystem structure and function, especiallythe impacts upon ecosystem productivity, sustainability and resilience;andbullet; Development and application of environmental management practicesthat provide for both commodity production and preservation of biologicaldiversity;andbullet; Adaptation of humans to an increasing extent, frequency and severityof environmental hazards;andbullet; Adoption of soil conservation practices in arid and semi-aridtemperate ecosystems with declining productivity;andbullet; Adaptation of human populations to increasingly economically marginalenvironments.<ITAG tagnum="85">Would You Like to Participate in a U.S. MAB Directorate?</ITAG>In our bulletin of March 1989 you were informed of our reorganization ofthe U.S. MAB Program into five new Directorates. An Abstract of the MissionStatement of each of these new Directorates appears above.Our National Committee wants to ensure that these new Directorates arecomposed of a balance of both social and biological/natural scientistsas well as of governmental agency and private sector scientists and representatives.Therefore, if you are interested in being appointed to a Directorate, pleasewrite to the U.S. MAB Secretariat to receive copies of the full Directoratemission statements and an application form.Applicants should submit the form and a short (4 page maximum) CV to theU.S. MAB Secretariat by October 1, 1989.
