L. 94-163, 89 Stat.917, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA),Pub. L. 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy ConservationAct of 1987 (NAECA), Pub. L. 100-12, and the National Appliance EnergyConservation Amendment of 1988 (NAECA 1988), Pub. L. 100-357. The Act requiresDOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumptionof certain consumer products, including furnaces. The intent of the testprocedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption thatwill assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test proceduresappear at 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B.DOE has amended the prescribed test procedure regulations, by adding andSection;430.27, to allow the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and RenewableEnergy to waive temporarily test procedures for a particular basic modelwhen a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more designcharacteristics which prevent testing of the basic model according to theprescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluatethe basic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumptioncharacteristics as to provide materially inadequate comparative data. 45FR 64108 (September 26, 1980).Pursuant to andSection; 430.27(g), the Assistant Secretary shall publishin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of each waiver granted and any limitingconditions of each waiver.The Trane Company (Trane) filed a ``Petition for Waiver'' in accordancewith andSection; 430.27 of 10 CFR Part 430. DOE published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> the Trane petition and solicited comments, data,and information respecting the petition. 54 FR 19226 (May 4, 1989). Onecomment was received from the Goodman Manufacturing Corporation which supportedthe waiver. DOE consulted with the Federal Trade Commission on May 25,1989, concerning The Trane petition.<ITAG tagnum="84">Assertions and Determinations</ITAG>Trane's petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that requirea 1.5 minute time delay between the ignition of the burner and the startingof the circulating air blower. Instead, Trane requests the allowance totest using a 30 second blower time delay when testing its TUC(^) seriesand TDC(^) series gas furnaces. Trane states that since the 30 second delayis indicative of how these models actually operate and since such a delayresults in an improvement in efficiency of approximately 1.8 percent, thewaiver should be granted.Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedures contain exceptionswhich allow testing with blower delay times of less than the prescribed1.5 minute delay. Trane indicates that it is unable to take advantage ofany of these exceptions for the TUC(^) series and TDC(^) series.Since the blower controls incorporated on the Trane furnace are designedto impose a 30 second blower delay in every instance of start up, and sincethe current provisions do not specifically address this type of control,DOE agrees that a waiver should be granted to allow the 30 second blowertime delay when testing the Trane series furnace. Accordingly, with regardto testing the TUC(^) series and TDC(^) series furnaces only, today's Decisionand Order exempts Trane from the existing provisions regarding blower controlsand allows testing with the 30 second delay. It is therefore ordered that: (1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by The Trane Company, (F-017) ishereby granted as set forth in paragraph (2) below, subject to the provisionsof paragraphs (3) and (4). (2) Not withstanding any contrary provisions of Appendix N of 10 CFR Part430, Subpart B, The Trane Company shall be permitted to test its TUC(^)series and TDC(^) series gas furnaces on the basis of the test procedurespecified in 10 CFR Part 430, with the modifications set forth below: (i) Section 9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1982 is deleted and replacedwith the following paragraph: ``Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After Equilibrium conditions areachieved following the cool-down test and the required measurements performed,turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the thermocouplegrid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comeon. After the burner start-up, delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes(t^), unless: (1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the powerburner and the indoor air circulating blower, in which case the burnerand blower shall be started together; (2) the furnace is designed to operateusing an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in whichcase the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or (3) thedelay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device whichshuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permittedto start the blower. In the latter case, if the fan control is adjustable,set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan controlis permitted to start the blower, measure time delay, (t^), using a stopwatch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up test for oil-fueledfurnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within andplusmin;0.01 in.of water gauge of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft.'' (ii) With the exception of the modification set forth in subparagraphs(i) above, The Trane Company shall comply in all respects with the testprocedures specified in Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B. (3) The waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of thisOrder until the Department of Energy prescribes final test procedures appropriateto the TUC(^) series and TDC(^) series condensing furnace manufacturedby The Trane Company. (4) This waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations,and documentary materials submitted by the applicant. This waiver may berevoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basisunderlying the application is incorrect.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, July 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John R.
