The loss came despite a 24% increase in revenues to $28.7 million from $23.2 million. Mobile said the loss was expected and stemmed from heavy spending to set up and market a paging service linking 54 American cities. Headquartered in Jackson, Miss., Mobile operates cellular telephone and electronic paging services.    For the first half, Mobile reported a loss of $6.2 million. In the first half of 1987, Mobile earned $3.47 million, or 17 cents a share. Revenues in the most-recent half increased 23% to $55.1 million from $44.8 million.    In February, BellSouth agreed to acquire Mobile for stock then valued at $710 million. Atlanta-based BellSouth is one of the regional Bell phone companies. Mobile has scheduled a shareholders meeting August 24, where the acquisition is expected to be approved. The transaction also requires approval by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Mobile's Class A stock closed at $29.625, down 12.5 cents; its Class B stock closed at $27.875, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
