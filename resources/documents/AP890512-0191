No election date has been set, and Haiti's military ruler, Lt.Gen. Prosper Avril, said late last year there would be no electionsfor at least two years.   Several political leaders have called for elections by the endof this year.   ``Citizens are not mobilized for elections now. We have toregain their confidence in the democratic process which was lostafter the aborted elections of Nov. 29,'' 1987, said the ElectoralCouncil secretary-general, Jean-Gerard Pierre.   On that date thugs protected by soldiers attacked voters atpolling stations, killing at least 34 people. The elections, whichwould have been the first free balloting in Haiti in more than 30years, were canceled by the ruling council of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.   Namphy came to power after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled toFrance in 1986 during uprisings against his regime. Namphy wasousted last September in a coup by soldiers who accused thegovernment of state-sponsored violence and demanded a return todemocracy.   The Electoral Council has nine members appointed by institutionsincluding the Roman Catholic Church, the news media and humanrights groups.   ``If elections are held in a hurry they will be a farce. Peopledo not yet have faith in Avril's will or ability to lead thecountry towards democracy,'' said Jean-Claude Roy, technicaladviser to a previous Electoral Council dissolved by Namphy hoursafter the election-day killings in 1987.   Troops loyal to Avril blocked an attempted coup by some militaryofficers on April 2, and the ringleaders were sent into exile.</TEXT></DOC>
