(``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'')filed with the Commission, pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')\1\<NOTE/> and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\<NOTE/> copies of a proposed rule change to adopt Rule 750A governingoption specialist performance evaluation and reallocation procedures. Thenew rule would be implemented as a pilot to run concurrently with the existingpilot program for revised NYSE Rule 103A.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See, </T3>Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 25681 (May 9, 1988) 53 FR17287. Notice of the proposal together with its terms of substance was given bythe issuance of a Commission release (Securities Exchange Act Release No.26001, August 16, 1988) and by publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 31948). No comments were received in connectionwith the proposal.Currently, NYSE option specialist activity is, for the most part, governedby Exchange rules designed for equity specialist activity but made applicableto option specialists by NYSE Rule 750. The rule incorporates by referencea variety of Exchange rules that regulate equity specialist conduct andtailors the rules specifically to the options market. Pursuant to NYSERule 750, the Exchange has proposed to adopt Rule 750A, which would incorporateby reference recently approved revisions to NYSE Rule 103A.\4\<NOTE/> The proposed rule contains performance improvement actionprocedures, reallocation procedures and procedural safeguards largely identicalto those contained in revised Rule 103A. As noted above, however, revisedRule 103A governs equity specialist performance evaluation and reallocationproceedings, while proposed rule 750A would establish procedures for theevaluation of option specialist performance and for the reallocation ofoption classes or products for substandard option specialist performance.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See, </T3>n. 3, <T3>supra.</T3>Under the new rule, the NYSE Market Performance Committee (``MPC'') wouldoversee the program and would be authorized to commence a performance improvementaction in the event an option specialist's performance falls below minimumperformance standards. In this connection, the proposed rule provides thatan option specialist would be subject to a performance improvement actionif the specialist unit receives an overall score of 4.00 for one semi-annualreview period on the specialist general information questionnaire (``OptionsSPEQ'') or a grade below 4.00 in any of the five categories on the OptionsSPEQ for two successive semi-annual review periods.\5\<NOTE/> Rule 750A further provides that the MPC would initiate aperformance improvement action in the event an option specialist unit regularlyfails to comply with Exchange rules and standards governing option specialistactivity.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ In the event the specialist unit's poor performance isattributable to highly unusual factors or extenuating circumstance involvingfactors beyond the control of the unit, however, the MPC would not be requiredto initiate a performance improvement action. A determination of highlyunusual factors or extenuating circumstances would be made by a majorityvote of the MPC. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The Rule provides for monitoring teams to assist optionspecialist units in developing performance improvement plans, which identifymeasures that the units can undertake to improve their performance as wellas meet performance improvement goals established by the MPC. Further,each monitoring team would be allowed to submit an interim report to theMPC at any time during the performance improvement action that recommends(1) termination of the performance improvement action due to improvementin the unit's performance; (2) modification of the unit's performance improvementplan; or (3) an allocation freeze. <T3>See, </T3>Proposed Rule 750A(b) (6).As is the case under NYSE Rule 103A, the performance improvement actionwould conclude within the time frame established by the MPC, unless ithas been terminated earlier as a result of the monitoring team's recommendation.The monitoring team would be required to render a final report to the MPC,at which time the MPC, following a review of the team's report, would determinewhether the specialist unit has met the specific performance improvementgoals contained in the specialist unit's improvement plan. Further, asprovided by the proposed rule, all units would be judged on the basis ofimprovement as demonstrated by their success, or lack thereof, in attainingthe performance improvement goals. A MPC determination that a specialistunit failed to meet the established goals would trigger reallocation proceedings,except in those cases in which the MPC believes that, given additionaltime (not to exceed one quarter) the unit can be reasonably expected toachieve its performance improvement goals. Reallocation proceedings under Rule 750A generally would be similar toreallocation proceedings under revised Rule 103A. Under Rule 750A, theMPC would be required to provide written notice to the specialist unitof the reallocation proceedings as well as an opportunity to defend itsperformance.\7\<NOTE/> A determination that the specialist unit failed to meet itsgoals would lead to the reallocation of its registered option classes orone or more option products. In identifying which class or product to reallocate,the MPC would consider performance areas in which the unit remains weakand would select the option classes or option products most associatedwith the weak performance areas. In the event the MPC is unable to identifyparticular option classes or one or more particular option products, theMPC would be allowed to use its discretion in determining which classesor products it believes should be reallocated.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ A written record of the proceedings would be maintained.Following the MPC's determination, the specialist unit would be providedan opportunity to persuade the MPC to reallocate other option classes orproducts and to request the MPC to consider revoking its registration inother option classes or products. The MPC would then make a final determinationas to which specialist unit's option classes or option products would bereferred to the Allocation Committee for reallocation.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The rule also provides for the initiation of reallocationproceedings in any instance where a specialist unit's performance in aparticular instance was so egregiously inadequate as to call into questionthe Exchange's integrity or impair the Exchange's reputation for maintainingan efficient, fair, and orderly market. <T3>See,</T3> proposed Rule 750A(f).Finally, all option specialist units would be entitled to appeal a MPCreallocation decision to the Exchange's Board of Directors pursuant toArticle IV, Section 14 of the NYSE Constitution. The rule would also barmember organizations associated directly or indirectly with either a memberof the MPC or any monitoring team from applying to the Allocation Committeefor an option class or product approved for reallocation.After careful consideration, the Commission believes that the NYSE proposalto adopt Rule 750A to run concurrently with the Rule 103A pilot is reasonableand therefore has determined to approved the proposed rule change. In particular,the Commission believes that the Rule 750A pilot will enable the Exchangeto monitor the effectiveness of the performance standards and other procedurescontained in the rule. The Commission further believes that Rule 750A willprovide structure to NYSE option specialist performance evaluations andreallocations. In this regard, we note that the new rule establishes specific,numerical standards of acceptable performance for option specialists aswell as a more general requirement of compliance with applicable Exchangerules. Taken together, the Commission believes that these performance requirementsshould provide option specialists with tangible measures by which the unitscan constantly assess their performance.Further, the new rule establishes guidelines for, among other things, performanceimprovement actions. Option specialist units whose performance is foundto be substandard will be provided with specific improvement goals developedby the Exchange in view of the unit's performance needs as well as otherbroader considerations such as overall market quality and order flow. Further,each unit will be permitted to participate in the preliminary stages ofthe performance improvement action by developing their own plan for performanceimprovement. The Commission believes that these procedures should enablethe Exchange to oversee option specialists performance improvement effortsto the greatest extent practical, and should allow for joint Exchange andmember efforts to remedy substandard specialist unit performance.Finally, the Commission believes that the procedural protections containedin Rule 750A should ensure that specialist units whose performance fallbelow minimum acceptable standards or units whose option classes or productsare subject to reallocation proceedings will be made aware of pending performanceimprovement or other remedial action and ensure that they are providedan opportunity to defend their performance.While the Commission believes that proposed Rule 750A is reasonable, however,the Commission nonetheless believes that the Exchange should develop andincorporate into the rule objective performance criteria in a manner similarto its Rule 103A pilot. In the Commission's view, the combination of objectiveand subjective performance measures will improve the Exchange's abilityto assess option specialist performance. For the reasons discussed above,the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with therequirements of the Act and the rule and regulations thereunder applicableto a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirementsof Section 6 and the rules and regulations thereunder.It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act that theabove mentioned proposed rule change be and hereby is approved.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: November 21, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
