CARTER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal agents armed with a search warrant took apersonal computer, a printer and computer diskettes from the officeof Georgia Power Co.'s chief financial officer, the company said.   Georgia Power spokesman David Altman said Internal RevenueService agents came to the office of Mike Harreld, the company'svice president and comptroller, Friday afternoon and left aboutthree hours later with the computer equipment and software.   ``We don't know exactly what (software) they took,'' Altmansaid. ``Obviously this is related to the ongoing investigation'' ofGeorgia Power's parent firm, The Southern Co.   The IRS has been investigating allegations of tax fraud, theft,cover-ups and illegal political contributions by officials andemployees at Southern subsidiaries for more than three years.   The probe heated up in August when a federal grand jury inAtlanta also began looking into the finances of Southern andsubsidiaries. Federal agents also raided Georgia Power offices atthat time.   IRS spokesman Kent Taylor said the agency could not ``confirm ordeny'' that a raid occurred Friday.   Altman said Harreld, who is in charge of all the company'sfinancial statements, would have no comment.   ``We really were very surprised at the search warrant,'' Altmansaid. ``We have been cooperating fully with the U.S. attorney'soffice on this investigation and we find it very surprising thatthey would feel the need to use a search warrant for materials thatthey perhaps could have gotten otherwise.''   The full scope of the IRS and grand jury investigations has notbeen disclosed, but initial reports centered on spare partsaccounting.   Two former managers at Gulf Power Co., one of the subsidiaries,were sentenced to prison for tax fraud, and a Pensacola, Fla.,businessman was convicted of perjury last year in kickback schemes.They were accused of stealing more then $80,000 by billing GulfPower for materials never delivered.   A third Gulf Power employee was fired this year after newkickback allegations.   The investigation has been marked by two unusual events.   Ray Howell, a Pensacola graphic designer who did contract workfor Gulf Power, disappeared a day before he was to testify beforethe Atlanta grand jury last December.   Then in April, Gulf Power Senior Vice President Jacob Hortondied in a Pensacola plane crash while he was on his way to Atlanta,apparently to talk with corporate officials about theinvestigations.   In addition to Georgia Power and Gulf Power, other Southernsubsidiaries are Alabama Power Co. and Mississippi Power Co.</TEXT></DOC>
