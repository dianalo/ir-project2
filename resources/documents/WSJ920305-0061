Paul Tsongas and Bill Clinton are slugging it outover which vision of liberalism is better able to fashion apresidential majority after years in the wilderness.   Mr. Tsongas, free from the vapors of Congress for the pastseven years, has been the most aggressive in rejectingnostrums of the national Democrats. He remains a socialliberal on everything from gay rights to the environment. Buthe downplays the &quot;fairness&quot; economic theme that is dogma inWashington. He candidly talks about &quot;incentives&quot; forbusiness, including a form of capital-gains tax cut, and hedoes the previously unthinkable in rejecting the demands ofsuch Democratic special interests as labor unions.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Some Democrats find us threatening,&quot; Mr. Tsongas said inhis Maryland victory speech Tuesday night. But &quot;if theDemocrats offer nothing better&quot; than they've offered in thepast, &quot;they're not going to win.&quot;   We differ with plenty of Mr. Tsongas's economic positions,but his candid stress on incentives for entrepreneurs is theclosest thing to a growth message we've seen from a nationalDemocrat since JFK. Mr. Tsongas is betting that a Democratcan win the presidency by pulling social liberals and youngpeople away from the Republicans on such issues as abortion,so long as he is first credible on the economy.   Mr. Clinton also fancies himself an &quot;outsider,&quot; yet histhemes are strikingly similar to those advertised byWashington Democrats. In particular, he mimics thecombination of permanent higher tax rates on &quot;the rich&quot; and&quot;tax credits&quot; (temporary subsidies) for the &quot;middle class&quot;that are at the heart of the Bentsen-Rostenkowski taxproposals. Mr. Tsongas by contrast says he would veto bothbills.   Mr. Clinton is making clear he intends to treat Mr.Tsongas from now on like any Republican. He quite angrilyattacked Mr. Tsongas Tuesday night for wanting &quot;a refinedversion of 1980-style trickle-down economics,&quot; a policy of,&quot;`Let's cut capital-gains tax across the board; let's makecorporate executives less accountable and they'll do what'sbest for us, create jobs. Don't worry about economicfairness; we'll deal with that later.' That candidate is notme.&quot;   This eager lunge into Harkin-like class warfare is noaccident, since it's central to the presidential strategymapped out over the past four years by Mr. Clinton'spollster, Stanley Greenberg. &quot;The key to Democratic successis becoming a middle-class centered, bottom-up coalition -- amass party, encompassing the needs of the have-nots andworking Americans,&quot; Mr. Greenberg has written.   So &quot;middle-class&quot; tax cuts, even phony ones, are offeredas a &quot;wedge&quot; to divide middle-income earners from the greedy&quot;rich.&quot; This theme of resentment -- encapsulated in the word&quot;fairness&quot; -- is designed to break voters away from theopportunitybased coalition of Ronald Reagan and, at least in1988, of George Bush. At the same time, Mr. Clinton tries todownplay such social issues as crime (and even abortion) andforeign policy, which have been Democratic liabilities.   Given the prevailing wisdom in Washington, it's notablethat Mr. Tsongas's heresy has attracted as many primary votesas it has. (Jerry Brown's mix of anti-nuke, pro-flat taxpolitics, we should add, is probably closer to Mr. Tsongas'sliberalism too.) We'll soon find out what kind of partyvoting Democrats want to be.</TEXT></DOC>
