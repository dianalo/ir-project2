About 10,000 farmers demonstrated outside the administrativeheadquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade inGeneva, site of the talks on freeing commerce in farm products and14 other areas.   The farmers, mainly from France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland,carried signs denouncing the talks and singling out U.S. TradeRepresentative Carla Hills for ``destroying European farmers.''   GATT farm talks were suspended after Washington and a group ofallied farm exporting nations rejected as insufficient a EuropeanCommunity offer for cuts in state supports.   France and Germany led opposition inside the 12-nation EC tooffering even the proposal now on the table.   ``Millions of family farms in Europe are threatened in theirextistence due to the proposals at the GATT talks,'' a leafletdistributed by the demonstrators said. ``Free trade withoutbarriers ... destroys structures oriented toward family farming,forces an industrialization of agriculture and creates instabilityon agrarian markets.''   The farmers said they do not oppose ``sensible adaptation'' andproposed ``an improved balance of markets'' in internationalagriculture.   GATT Director-General Arthur Dunkel of Switzerland received afarmer delegation inside the trade organization's lakesidebuilding. The marchers then continued through Geneva.   No injuries were reported in the demonstration. Swiss policewere out in force for the protest.   Dunkel, who oversees the entire GATT talks, warned on Mondaythat plans to conclude an ambitious package of market-openingaccords at a Dec. 3-7 ministerial meeting are ``now in jeopardy.''   In an emergency meeting of senior negotiators, he appealed toall sides to show more flexibility within a matter of days.   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said last week itwould be ``a big mistake to even contemplate extending thenegotiations.''   The United States and the Australian-led, 13-nation Cairnsgroup, which also includes major Third World farm exporters, onSaturday refused negotiations on an EC offer to cut farm supportsby 30 percent.   The proposal provides for cuts in overall aid over 10 yearsbackdated to 1986, thus giving the EC credit for mesaures alreadytaken.   There are no separate provisions for cutting export subsidies,which Washington has said it considers indispensable.   The United States and the Cairns group are seeking cuts of 75percent in domestic supports and import barriers, and 90 percent inexport subsidies, spaced over 10 years with 1991 as base year.</TEXT></DOC>
