Therefore, softtissue neck radiography has been advocated as a definitive non-operativeapproach for diagnosing these lesions. However, we have noted similarasymmetric subglottic narrowing in patients with acquired subglotticcysts. These retention cysts occur following long-term intubation inthe neonate. The mechanism probably involves subglottic fibrosis whichobstructs glands with subsequent cyst formation. Acquired subglotticcysts typically appear as an asymmetric narrowing on frontal or lateralsoft tissue neck radiographs. These lesions may produce airway compromisebut are effectively treated by forceps or laser removal. Acquired subglotticcysts must be included in the differential diagnosis of asymmetric subglotticnarrowing. The definitive diagnosis is made by direct laryngoscopy, notsoft tissue neck radiograph.</TEXT></DOC>
