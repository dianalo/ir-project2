This insect spreadto the United States from Mexico in 1917, and now exists throughout mostof the cotton-producing states west of the Mississippi River. Prior to the effective date of this document, the pink bollworm quarantineand regulations (contained in 7 CFR 301.52 <T3>et seq., </T3>and referred to below as the regulations) quarantinedthe states of Arizona, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada,New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas because of the pink bollworm. The regulationsrestrict the interstate movement of regulated articles from regulated areasin quarantined states for the purpose of preventing the artificial spreadof the pink bollworm. Surveys conducted by inspectors of the U.S. Department of Agriculture andofficials of state agencies of Mississippi have established that pink bollwormno longer exists in previously regulated areas in Bolivar and Washingtoncounties in Mississippi. Therefore, we are removing these counties fromthe list of regulated areas in andSection; 301.52-2a. Since there are nolonger any areas remaining in Mississippi designated as regulated areas,we are also deleting Mississippi from the list of states quarantined becauseof pink bollworm.<ITAG tagnum="84">Immediate Action </ITAG>James W. Glosser, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService has determined that a situation exists that warrants publicationof this rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate actionis necessary to relieve unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movementof regulated articles. Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this ruleare impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions,there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make this rule effective uponpublication. We will consider comments that are postmarked or receivedwithin 60 days of publication of this interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. As soon as possible after the comment periodcloses, we will publish another document in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>discussing the comments we received and any amendmentswe are making to the rule as a result of the comments. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291. This action affects the interstate movement of regulated articles fromspecified areas in the state of Mississippi. There are hundreds of smallentities that move these articles interstate from nonregulated areas inthe United States. However, based on information compiled by the Department,it has been determined that eight small entities move these articles interstatefrom the previously quarantined areas in Mississippi. Further, we estimatethat this action will save approximately $7,000 per year. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The regulations in this subpart contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.
