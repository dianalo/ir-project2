 I had been trying to avoid it for some time but,sadly, I had so many people on my case about my inability to receive faxesfrom them that I finally had to get one.andM;That, plus the fact that my secretary was starting to get a little surlyabout not having one around to send documents to customers.andM;I now have one with all the goodies.andP;  Not only is it a fax machine, but it isalso an answering machine and can forward calls and information to othernumbers.andP;  It has a large amount of memory so that even if it runs out ofpaper, it keeps things safe and tidy until someone feeds it another tree.andM;Isn't technology marvelous?andM;The machine can also put my company name on the banner and auto-dial otherfax and phone numbers.andP;  It can even send junk faxes to more than 500 numbersafter it has recorded my fax message into its memory and decides it's time todial other systems.andP;  In addition, it has a pile of other features asjustified by a documentation kit that could put the VMS doc set to shame.andP;  Ithas on-line help, icons and so many other neat gadgets that it's a primecandidate for the Sharper Image Hall of Fame.andM;I'm tempted to open it up and find out what CPU it has, just to satisfy mycuriosity.andP;  With my luck, it's probably running Unix with a Korn shell and anew command of fx in it.andM;As a joke, I asked the manufacturer's representative if it had Basic in it.andO;He didn't laugh.andP;  As a matter of fact, he took same notes and said he wouldget back to me.andM;The real significance of getting a fax machine in the computing environmentis that it represents the shape of things to come.andP;  There are alreadycompanies on the market that make fax boards and software to send and receivefaxes on your Mac, PC, PS, or Unix or VAX/VMS system.andP;  I've used almost allof them--and I even like a couple of them.andP;  The problem is, of course, whatgood is a picture of what was on a piece of paper if it cannot be used bysome other application, somehow?andM;Enter the optical character reader (OCR), which can take our electronicallytransmitted faxes, put them onto our systems in binary, bit-mapped files andscan them for text.andP;  Upon finding text, the OCR converts it into ASCII files.andO;These can be used by almost any application--databases, word processing, youname it.andP;  So, it starts with the humble fax and ends up becoming a record ina database somewhere.andM;Some of the OCR people also have software that can split out the pictures andgraphics in a fax onto Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files.andP;  This meansthat the pictures on the fax can be regarded as objects separate from thetext and manipulated as such.andP;  One guy I know who has a fax machine and a faxcard on his PC uses the fax machine to send himself faxes as a poor man'sdigitizer.andP;  I used to laugh at him, but it works pretty well, especially infine-resolution mode.andP;  The ingenuity of people is often astounding andrewarding as well.andM;I was well-informed on faxes before I purchased one.andP;  I consulted my partner,who is semitechnical (he won't admit it, but he is) and who has admiredtechnical goodies for as long as I have known him.andP;  (He thinks Sharper Imageis divinely inspired; who am I to argue with the truth?)andP;  When asked, heprovided this shopping list for a base configuration:andM;* At least a 30-page feeding mechanism for outgoing documents;andM;* A page transmission marker to verify transmission (also called atransmission stamp);andM;* A document title and time marker;andM;* A paper cutter for incoming faxes (you'd be surprised how many faxes do nothave this feature);andM;* At least Group III compatibility (a CCITT standard);andM;* A dark-colored casing (apparently the fax toner gets all over things, andthe beige-colored cases end up looking dingy after a while);andM;* A paper catcher for incoming faxes;andM;* A transaction-logging capability so that you know who got what at what timeand how long the faxes took to send, so you can estimate the cost of sendinginformation;andM;* A maintenance contract with a local company;andM;* Off-the-shelf toner and paper so you can replenish them at any officesupply store;andM;* Auto-answer and auto-redial if the remote line is busy;andM;* Storage for often-dialed numbers.andM;Of course, many other widgets and doodads could be implemented, but my expertconsiders the above to be the minimum required.andM;My concern with fax machines, over and above the fact that in three weeks offaxing I have gone through two huge rolls of paper--and I am rarely in theoffice--is the aftermath.andP;  If fax today, what next?andM;Based on the above, it should be obvious that faxes can be received onsystems.andP;  The next step is electronic fax-mail, where documents are createdelectronically, shipped via a network and delivered electronically.andO;Actually, this can be done now, but not through dedicated networkingresources.andP;  Electronically created fax files, currently uncompressed, aremuch larger than equivalent ASCII text files, and this translates into morestorage capacity needed on the network, not to mention more work by the CPUsto move the data around the network.andP;  Plus, obviously, the need for moreoverhead on the network to move the data around.andM;One company that I know of is working on a fax product that will let PCs andother systems exchange fax documents over the network without ever resortingto a dial-up of any kind.andP;  It's kind of a system-to-system fax capability.andO;The recipients can then store, edit, forward and perform myriad other featson the received fax to make it a truly useful communications medium.andP;  Thereis even a push to provide fax processing through existing electronic mailsystems and message routers under the X.400 standard.andM;Security is definitely a problem with faxes.andP;  Because anyone with access tothe fax machine can see the faxes, there is little, if any, security.andP;  Ifsystem-to-system faxes catch on, we will need to look into the problems offax protection, group viewing and related faxing issues.andM;Another company is taking faxing on the system a step further by annotatingvoice onto a fax document stored on a system.andP;  In this manner, readers of thefax can exchange information about its contents without any modification tothe fax.andP;  The document increases markedly in size as voice messages are addedon, so storage and transportation of the document around the network becomeproblems.andM;Why is all this important?andP;  Faxes are a visual medium, hence their inherentattractiveness to the consumer.andP;  They are powerful communication tools.andP;  Sowhy not include them as pop-up utilities and desk accessories on systems onthe network?andP;  Why not include them as attachments to mail messages, voicemessaging or other communications media?andM;Through the use of technologies such as DEC's Compound Document Architecture,why not have all types of media exist as valid information between users,including faxes?andM;I have this horrid feeling that faxes are going to be the next cellularphone.andP;  We will all have one at home and in our cars, and a coat-sized onewill be attached to our personal electronic diary that receives informationvia its cellular interface.andM;By storing information on systems instead of paper, databases, informationretrieval technologies, network technologies, storage facilities and othernetwork components will evolve to accommodate the rampant onslaught of faxtechnologies.andM;I would continue, but I see a fax coming in....andM;Bill Hancock is a principal at Network-1, a New York-based companyspecializing in network security and counsulting.andP;  He is also a member of theDECUS board of directors.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
