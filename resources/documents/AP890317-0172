He said40 people went to the Webb County Jail in Laredo and nine to StarrCounty Jail in Rio Grande City.   A disturbance broke out at the 315-acre, minimum-security centerfor aliens facing deportation about 2:45 p.m. Thursday. About 200men threw rocks and ripped up a section of fence, but did not try toescape, officials said.   An INS riot squad quickly assembled and brought the situationunder control, said officials and immigration attorneys whowitnessed the demonstration at the Port Isabel Service ProcessingCenter.   The rural camp is just south of the Laguna Atascosa NationalWildlife Refuge and about 20 miles northeast of the border city ofBrownsville.   INS officials don't know why the disturbance began, Austin said,but he speculated that it probably was the result of frustration ofdetention.   He said the center was calm Friday. Extra guards sealing off themain entrance and exit Thursday were gone Friday.   Brownsville immigration attorney Linda Yanez, who was at thecenter interviewing clients when the demonstration broke out, saidthe incident was inevitable.   ``These people do not have any sense of what their legal rightsare, what their situation is,'' Ms. Yanez said. ``They don't haveany telephones.''   All 1,600 people at the recreation area rushed the fence, but didnot try to escape, she said.   ``Of course people are going to be tense when they are heldincommunicado and families are split up,'' she said.   Representatives from the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees also were present for a regular observation visit Thursdaywhen the INS cleared all visitors and civilian personnel from thecamp. The UN officials declined comment on the incident.   The center held 2,279 men and women Friday, primarily CentralAmericans, including 754 men sleeping in tents.   Its population has increased by 500 percent since Feb. 21, whenthe INS started immediate detention of immigrants whose initialapplications for political asylum are denied in South Texas.   Stepped up Border Patrol enforcement and a curtailment ofrecognizance releases of those apprehended also have swelled thenumber of detainees. Most aliens are held at the center in lieu ofdeportation bonds of up to $4,000.   The INS' position is that most of the Nicaraguans, ElSalvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans entering southern Texas donot qualify as political refugees because they are here for economicreasons.   Asylum is granted to those able to convince the U.S. Justice andState departments that they are fleeing persecution.   He said attorneys' allegations of shortages of food and medicalcare at the center were untrue. The U.S. Public Health Serviceprovides doctors, physicians and nurses to attend to the detainees,Austin said.   A water shortage, however, makes it impossible for every detaineeto bathe daily, Austin said.</TEXT></DOC>
