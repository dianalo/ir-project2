In Lebanon, police said Israeli troops led by tanks and backedby helicopter gunships punched into southeastern Lebanon in pursuitof Palestinian guerrillas.   An Israeli military communique said, ``The army is combing thesecurity zone because of increasing attempts to infiltrate intoIsrael for purposes of murder and hostage-taking.   The army censored all other details about the operation.Israel's self-designated security zone is a six-to-10 mile widestrip north of its border with Lebanon.   Police in Beirut said initial reports from the area in thewestern sector of Lebanon's Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valleyindicated that at least three guerrillas were taken prisoner.   The Israeli thrust came in the wake of increasing cross-borderguerrilla raids into northern Israel from southeast Lebanon inrecent weeks.   In Israel, Lt. Col. Ranaan Gissin, a military spokesman, saidthe army had opened a new detention center in Jerusalem forPalestinians under age 16.   Israeli military law in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strippermits arrest and imprisonment of children aged 12-16. Gissin saidthe youngest detainees in the new center were 14.   ``We've concentrated the youngsters in one prison ... so theywon't be incited by older inmates,'' Gissin said.   In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, 16-year-old Nidal Abdulhak ofBeit Wazan died Sunday night in Al Ittihad Hospital, the army said.   Hospital officials quoted family members as saying he waselectrocuted while following orders from soldiers to remove aPalestinian flag from the pole, but the army said Abdulhakapparently was trying to hang the red, green, black and whitebanner. Israel has outlawed the Palestinian flag.   Abdulhak's death brought to at least 177 the number ofPalestinians killed since the rebellion began Dec. 8 in the WestBank and Gaza, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 Middle Eastwar. An Israeli soldier and Jewish settler also have been slain.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Monday he supports giving upparts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to form a Palestinian stateunder Jordanian sovereignty in return for peace.   ``I'm in favor of ... the establishment of two states, the stateof Israel as a Jewish state ... and east of it, a sovereign statewhich has substantial portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip andincludes at least 1 million residents of the occupied territoriesas a Jordanian-Palestinian state,'' Rabin said on Israel radio.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his conservative Likud blocopposes giving up the occupied lands.   An Interior Ministry order shut down Al Awdah, a weekly based inArab east Jerusalem and published in English and Arabic.   The order was delivered Monday to owner Ibrahim Kareen. He alsois publisher of the English-language Palestine Press Service, animportant source of information on the occupied territories. Theagency was closed March 30 for six months.   Israel has closed two pro-Palestinian newspapers and the pressservice during the five-month uprising and arrested at least 22Israeli and Arab reporters. The army also has periodically barredjournalists from the occupied lands, contending that their presenceincites Arab protest.   According to the shutdown order signed by Interior Ministryofficial Eli Suissa, Al Awdah was ``funded by terror organizations,serves as their tool and is directed by them.''   Kareen said Al Awdah's funds came from subscribers. ``This was apolitical decision,'' he said. ``Maltreatment of journalists hasbecome government policy.''   He said the weekly, which was founded six years ago and has acombined circulation of about 10,000 in English and Arabic, was thefirst Palestinian publication to interview Israelis in an effort topromote dialogue.   ``Now the only relationship left is of occupied and occupier,''Kareen said.   The Supreme Court heard an appeal from Michal Schwartz, editorof the left-wing newspaper Derech Hanitzotz. She was arrested lastweek and has been denied the right to see her lawyer.   Ms. Schwartz was one of three Israeli editors at the newspaperarrested for alleged security offenses. The paper was closed inFebruary and accused of links to the Democratic Front for theLiberation of Palestine, a Syrian-backed guerrilla faction led byNaif Hawatmeh.   Prosecutor Malhiel Ballas said Ms. Schwartz should not beallowed to meet with her lawyer, Felicia Langer, because Ms. Langerprobably would leak details of the secret investigation.   Israel radio quoted Ms. Langer, who often represents Palestiniansecurity prisoners, as saying she never has broken a commitment tomaintain secrecy.</TEXT></DOC>
