The urgency of the industry effort was underscored yesterday when the Environmental Protection Agency and a large international alliance of manufacturers and users both called for a total phase-out on the chemicals, known as chlorofluorocarbons.    The EPA and the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, which previously advocated only a 50% reduction, said they now agree with such large producers as Du Pont Co. that a complete ban is necessary. The EPA and Alliance, however, didn't set a time frame for the phase-out, while Du Pont has said it expects to complete the ban by the year 2000.    The EPA based its new position on a recently completed study it authorized. The study shows that reductions actually won't significantly reduce the amount of chlorine and bromines that are thought to be responsible for the destruction of the ozone layer.    According to the study, the harmful chemicals already present in the atmosphere are expected to continue to spread and attack the ozone layer -- even if the reduction targets called for by the agency's own proposed regulations and an international treaty drawn up by the alliance are met.    The study also found that, because of transport delays to the stratosphere and the long lifetime of chlorine, levels of the chemical will continue to increase for about six to eight years even if emissions are totally eliminated. Bromines, which are an important ingredient of halon, pose a similar threat, the research showed. Halon is used in fire extinguishers.    The agency said its study paints &quot;an alarming picture of present and future global ozone levels.&quot; David Doniger, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the report &quot;means we're much deeper in the soup than we thought we were.&quot;    The EPA also reviewed earlier findings by a panel of scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that suggested ozone depletion was worse than anticipated. That study had provided the basis for Du Pont's decision last March to phase out production.    The EPA has proposed regulations that would cut CFC production by 50% of 1986 production levels by 1999. Such a reduction is also proposed by an international treaty that manufacturing countries world-wide will vote on next month.    Ozone depletion is considered a major environmental problem. The ozone layer screens out harmful ultraviolet rays that can cause skin cancer, eye ailments and other health problems, as well as environmental damage. Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, are used in a wide range of essential products, such as air conditioners, and other items, such as plastic foam.    Du Pont, the world's largest producer of CFCs under its trade name Freon, is jockeying for the top spot in providing substitutes. Du Pont said it plans to make a &quot;significant&quot; announcement later this week about large-scale production for one such alternative, though the Wilmington, Del., chemical and energy giant declined to be more specific.    Some competitors speculate that Du Pont may have developed a good substitute for cleaning solvents used in the electronics industry. An earlier effort didn't pass toxicity tests. Others believe there may be production plans for refrigerant substitutes.    Du Pont already has said it plans to start up commercial production later this fall for two blowing agents used in a variety of insulation and cushioning applications. It also is running pilot plants for the refrigerants.    Meanwhile, the ICI Americas Inc. unit of Imperial Chemicals Industries PLC has jumped into the fray, vowing to be the first to commercialize alternatives. The company cites an $84 million research project and its pilot production of refrigerant substitutes.    Allied-Signal Inc. said it recently increased by 75% the number of scientists working on substitutes and increased its research budget to $250 million. &quot;We're going full tilt,&quot; said a spokesman for Allied.    Added Michael Harris, development manager for Halocarbon at ICI Americas, &quot;We're in the biggest competitive race I've ever experienced. Du Pont has been vociferous this year. We're busy doing things instead of talking about it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
