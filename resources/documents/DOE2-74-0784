Theprocessing of mineral resources at high temperatures in electric powerstations and industrial plants etc. and in refuse incineration resultsin releases of volatile elements to the atmosphere such as As, Cd andPb. Source-receptor models for trace elements have been formulated andused to relate measured concentrations in air to estimated emissions.The deposition pattern is relatively well documented, both from precipitationanalyses and moss surveys. Mercury in the atmosphere as gaseous, elementalmercury, is not readily deposited by precipitation or taken up by plantsor water surfaces. Ozone promotes precipitation scavenging. Large quantitiesof elemental mercury and gaseous mercury compounds are released by combustionprocesses. The deposition of mercury by precipitation is clearly correlatedwith the deposition of other air pollutants. The relationship betweenthe sources and the physico-chemical processes involved are not fullyunderstood. Chlorinated hydrocarbons are pesticides, industrial chemicalsor additives and compounds formed as undesirable byproducts in industrialand combustion processes. The location and magnitude of emissions arenot well known, but may in some cases be inferred from production volumes.Measurements are scarce, but indicate that they are despersed and depositedon a regional and a global scale. Deposition from the atmosphere is themost important source in terrestrial and aquatic food-chains. Restrictionson the use of PCBs in the 1970's have not been effective in reducingconcentrations in ambient air and precipitation. 197 ref., 19 tables,11 drawings.</TEXT></DOC>
