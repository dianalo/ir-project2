The National Weather Service said Hurricane Hugo hit the easterntip of Puerto Rico and skirted the northern coast, packing 125 mphwinds and a 6-foot tidal surges. Forecasters expected up to 15inches of rain and flooding and mudslides all over the island.   ``We're getting ravaged,'' said ham radio operator FernandoGarcia in San Juan. ``Part of my aluminum siding is gone, my nextdoor neighbor's aluminum siding is gone ....''   There were reports of heavy damage, some looting, no water and noelectricity in Puerto Rico.   At noon EDT, Hugo's center was near latitude 18.6 degrees northand longitude 66.0 west about 20 miles north of San Juan, said theNational Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.   On Sunday, Hugo plowed west-northwest through the easternCaribbean, slamming into the U.S. and British Virgin Islands with100 mph winds and rains that caused heavy flooding and destroyedhomes.   Five people were reported killed, 80 injured and more than 10,000homeless on the French island of Guadeloupe, relief officials said.Corrugated steel roofs were torn off, power lines ripped free andcrops were destroyed. The airport's control tower was knocked out ofcommission, permitting only visual landings by relief planes.   Two people were killed in Antigua and one in Montserrat,according to Beacon Radio in Anguilla. Ham radio operators reportedat least five deaths in Montserrat, but there was no officialconfirmation.   Nearly all of Montserrat's 12,000 residents were homeless andschools, hospitals and the police department all suffered seriousdamage, said ham radio operator Stuart Haimes of Queens, N.Y.   Police said a man was electrocuted in Puerto Rico when he toucheda power line while removing a TV antenna from his roof in preparingfor the storm.   Off St. Thomas, charter boat captain O.B. O'Brian told CNN byship-to-shore telephone this morning:   ``Looking down the lagoon, we see a lot of sailboats intertwinedand a lot of sails ripped and a lot of sails down. It looks prettybad ... There was a lot of wind.''   Most of the Virgin Islands' 106,000 residents live on St. Thomas.On St. Croix, a ham radio operator said the winds tore off the roofsfrom up to 75 percent of the homes.   Officials said stores in the St. Croix town of Christiansted wereheavily damaged, and there were reports of looting. National GuardAdjutant Gen. Robert Moorehead said 1,000 people were evacuated torescue shelters in St. Croix.   Storm watches were in effect for parts of the Dominican Republic,and a hurricane warning was issued for the southern Bahamas,including the Turks and Caicos islands.   Hugo was moving at 10 mph west-northwest alongside Puerto Rico, aU.S. commonwealth with 3.3 million people. Hurricane-force windsextended up to 75 miles from its center. The weather service saidwinds ripped the roof off a baseball stadium on the offshore islandof Vieques, about 10 miles to the east with about 7,000 residents.   High winds Sunday blew roofs off six houses in the offshoreisland of Culebra. Luis Munoz Marin International Airport, by farthe region's biggest, was closed, as were schools, banks, courts andgovernment offices.   The National Guard had been mobilized in both the Virgin Islandsand Puerto Rico.   Meteorologist Jesse Moore at the National Hurricane Center saidit was too early to tell whether Hugo would strike the U.S.mainland. He said the storm was expected to be off the southeasternBahamas by Wednesday and ``after that, it's anybody's guess.''   Residents of hilly areas where flash floods are a danger wereurged to evacuate, and Social Services Secretary Carmen Sonia Zayassaid 11,300 people were moved from flood-prone coastal areas torescue shelters.   The Port Authority also said cruise ships scheduled to arrive inSan Juan, where one-third of the island population lives, had beenrouted elswhere.   Hugo uprooted trees and knocked out power in the British VirginIslands. On the resort island of Tortola in the British VirginIslands, residents said there were numerous injuries and scores ofhomes destroyed.   ``We are aware of the widespread damage. We may have to declarethe area a disaster area,'' said Louis Walters, education ministerin the British Virgin Islands.   The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were last hit by a majorhurricane in 1956, when Betsy caused extensive damage and killed 11people in Puerto Rico.   Officials in Guadeloupe said many buildings were damaged.   The mayor of St. Francois, a village on the island's eastern end,told Radio Caraibe Internationale that there was nothing left of it.   ``Aside from a few houses, almost all the rest were destroyed,''said Mayor Ernest Moutoussamy. He said several hotels sufferedserious damage.   In Paris, a plane was sent Sunday with 60 rescue workers andemergency supplies for Guadeloupe, and two more were standing bywaiting for Caribbean airports to reopen.   Hugo is the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season,which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.   It is the most powerful hurricane to hit the region sinceHurricane David in 1979. That storm killed an estimated 1,200 peoplein the Caribbean and Florida.</TEXT></DOC>
