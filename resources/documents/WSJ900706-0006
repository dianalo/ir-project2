Productivity, widely regarded as the truest reflection ofunderlying economic vigor, has risen only slightly over thepast year and actually fell in the early months of 1990. Andmany economists foresee very slow gains, at best, in comingmonths.</LP><TEXT>   The lackluster performance, many analysts say, reflects inpart the steadily growing role of services. Servicebusinesses now account for about 77% of all U.S. privatenonfarm jobs, which include jobs in manufacturing, mining andconstruction. This figure is up from 70% in the mid-1970s and60% in the early 1960s.   But the service sector accounts for only some 47% of theeconomy's total output. Service-sector jobs generally don'tlend themselves as readily to productivity gains as jobs inmanufacturing, whose share of total employment has fallen toabout 17% from more than 30% in the early 1960s.   In the first quarter, overall productivity in nonfarmbusinesses fell at an annual rate of 2.7%, according to U.S.data. This decline was the steepest drop since early in the1981-82 recession, and it occurred even though productivityin manufacturing rose at an annual rate of 4.9% in thequarter; sharply falling productivity in service businesseswiped out the gain.   Some economists, it should be noted, maintain that theproductivity picture is less bleak than it seems, becauseproductivity is difficult to measure in service businessesand may be understated in the official Labor Departmentfigures.   Gerald Faulhaber, a professor at the University ofPennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, thinks the&quot;government may be missing gains in service productivity.&quot; Asan example, he cites the work of secretaries, who &quot;with thespread of word processors are doing a higher level of work,&quot;which isn't given enough weight.   Maury Harris, a PaineWebber Inc. economist in New York,believes the Labor Department may not be taking intofull-enough consideration improved quality in the servicesector. He notes that capital spending has risen fastest inservice businesses recently and wonders how such spending cancontinue &quot;at a swift pace&quot; without corresponding productivitygains.   Edwin R. Dean, associate commissioner of labor statisticsconcedes that &quot;there's some reason to think that we may beunderstating service productivity.&quot; He adds that &quot;we don'tnecessarily take account of all quality changes. No onereally knows.&quot;   In any event, there's little question that productivitygains generally are more difficult to achieve in servicebusinesses. &quot;Part of the problem in services is that newpeople entering the labor force -- often those with the leastskill -- tend to go into service jobs,&quot; says Uday S.Karmarkar, a professor at the University of Rochester's SimonBusiness School.   Another large factor in the productivity slowdown, manyanalysts say, is the length of the current businessexpansion.   &quot;Productivity typically shows the sharpest gains in theearly stages of an economic expansion and the narrowest gainsin the late stages,&quot; says Geoffrey H. Moore, director ofColumbia University's Center for International Business CycleResearch. The current expansion, he notes, is 7 1/2 yearsold, which is more than twice the average for earlierexpansions.   &quot;Given this expansion's very old age, it's hardlysurprising that productivity has slowed,&quot; Mr. Moore says.   The pattern of slowing productivity reflects in part adiminished supply of untapped labor after many recession-freeyears. The labor pool -- in terms of the percentage of theworking-age population not at work -- has declinedpersistently since the most recent recession, hitting recordlows in recent months. May's figures were 36.7%, within awhisker of March's record of 36.6%. A further drag onproductivity has been earlier retirement among a relativelyproductive group: males who are 45 to 54 years old.   A slowdown in productivity, and then an actual decline,occurred for example in the latter stages of the long 1975-80expansion. Productivity gains narrowed from 3% in 1976, to1.8% in 1977, and to 0.9% in 1978. And then, in the upturn'sfinal year, the gains disappeared. In the final quarter of1979, the last of the expansion, productivity fell at anannual rate of 2.2%.   If a recession should develop in coming weeks, as someeconomists predict, history shows the recent decline inproductivity could well be followed by further sharp drops.Productivity fell at an annual rate of 2.6% in the 1980second quarter, the low point of that year's recession, andoutput dropped at annual rate of 5.8% in the early months ofthe 1981-82 recession, which preceded the current expansion.   More likely than a recession, in the view of manyforecasters, is that as the year winds down the economy willcontinue to expand sluggishly and productivity will followsuit. The anticipated gains will fail to match hourly payincreases, and so profits will remain under pressure as laborcosts climb.   Already on the increase, labor costs per unit of outputrose 4.5% last year, up from 2.7% in 1988 and 2.6% in 1987.The 1989 rise was the sharpest gain since 1982, a recessionyear.   Some economists note that productivity gains have alsonarrowed abroad in recent years, for much the same reasons asin the U.S. However, the record abroad is generally superiorto the U.S. performance.   A Richmond Federal Reserve Bank study shows that in arecent seven-year interval the productivity of U.S.businesses rose only 0.6% annually, compared with gains of2.8% in Japan, 2.4% in France, 2% in West Germany and 1.9% inBritain. The report also shows that the rate of private fixedinvestment in the U.S., at about 15% of gross nationalproduct, has persistently trailed comparable rates abroad.For example, the rate in Japan has ranged near 25% and inWest Germany around 20%.   Kurt Richebacher, an economic consultant based in Zurich,blames America's &quot;retarded productivity growth&quot; largely on&quot;the abysmal performance of U.S. savings and investmentduring the 1980s.&quot; Investment, he adds, &quot;is the wellspring ofproductivity growth.&quot;   For all the dark spots, it should be added that the U.S.productivity picture is not without a few bright ones. Whileproductivity growth has lagged behind in the U.S., inabsolute terms U.S. productivity remains at the top in globalrankings.   On a per-employee basis, for example, economic output inJapan in 1989 came to only 72.7% of the U.S. level, accordingto Labor Department data. Other comparable rates were 82% inWest Germany, 85.9% in France, 39.8% in South Korea, 87.3% inItaly, 71.5% in Britain, 77.2% in the Netherlands, 67.7% inSweden, and 94% in Canada.   In addition, there are increasing signs that individualU.S. companies -- in services as well as in manufacturing --are finding new ways to spur productivity.   In the Webster, N.Y., plant of Xerox Corp., for example,robots long used to paint copiers recently were assigned suchrelatively sophisticated tasks as welding.   And American Express Co. recently increased productivityof its personnel through faster settlement of billingdisputes. For instance, when a credit-card holder in Floridawith a good credit record ordered a ring from a Chicagojeweler, the ring arrived with a stone missing.   &quot;Under our old rules, there would have been exchanges ofletters taking weeks,&quot; says Roger H. Ballou, president of thefirm's travel-services group. &quot;But not now -- we got busywith fax and phone messages and in three days the client hadthe ring fixed and back.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
