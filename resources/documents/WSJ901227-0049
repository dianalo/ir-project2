Cheating bankruptcy and struggling under a mountain ofdebt, Western Union and its management team, led by New Yorkfinancier Bennett S. LeBow, told 9,000 company retirees inlate November that they would have to make significantlylarger payments to their retiree medical fund to keep theirbenefits intact.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Payments typically went up two to three times and in somecases more than that, depending on the medical options theyhad,&quot; said a Western Union spokesman. &quot;So if you were, say,paying $55 a month, now you had to pay something like $125 ormore.&quot;   About 225 of these retired workers were longtime formeremployees of ITT's World Communications international telexbusiness, which ITT sold to Western Union in 1987.   In mid-December, when one irate former ITT employeecomplained that ITT had sold its former workers down theriver to a company that was killing his benefits, ITT steppedin. It offered to make up 85% of the difference between whatthe former ITT workers had been paying into their medicalplan and the amount that Mr. LeBow and his managers were nowdemanding -- at least during 1991.   Why? &quot;Our contributions will range from $10 a month forsome employees to about $500,&quot; said an ITT spokesman.&quot;Western Union said the {retirees} would have to pay so manyhundreds of dollars a month to keep the coverage. These werelong-service employees and we were concerned that they havethe right coverage. It was the right thing to do.&quot;   But a Western Union spokesman defended the company'sposition. &quot;This company has a six-to-one ratio of retirees toactive workers. We very reluctantly had to reduce our subsidyto the plan because of the company's impaired financialcondition.&quot;   Since taking over Western Union in late 1987 in a dealthat was touted as a bid to save Western Union, Mr. LeBow andhis managers have sold off numerous Western Union operations,fired half its work force and slashed pension and otherbenefits to those that still work at the almost 140-year-oldcommunications company.   During the same period, however, the LeBow rescue team hasprospered with steadily increasing compensation. Mr. LeBowalone has been drawing a $2.4 million annual management fee,including $50,000 per month for overhead expenses. And thisyear, President Robert Amman and Chief Financial OfficerStewart J. Paperin received raises of 23% and 26%,respectively, not counting bonuses. Their medical benefitsremain intact.   Mr. LeBow will no longer draw that management fee under adeal worked out with the company's bondholders as onecondition for accepting an exchange offer aimed atrestructuring the company's $530 million in junk-bond debt.</TEXT></DOC>
