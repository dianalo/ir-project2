However, Circuit Judge Joseph Farina restricted evidence aboutplans for quelling any violence that might stem from the officer'strial.   The judge and attorneys for both sides agreed Tuesday that riotswere likely if Officer William Lozano were acquitted.   Lozano's attorney, Roy Black, who wants the trial moved fromDade County, did succeed today in admitting a Metro-Dade policecontingency plan into evidence, although Farina ordered it sealedfor now.   Also introduced was a poster from the ``Overtown Comrades'' thatthe defense described as an inflammatory and offered as proof ofefforts to whip up anger over the trial in the black community.   Lozano is charged with two counts of manslaughter in the deathsof motorcyclist Clement Lloyd, 23, and passenger Allan Blanchard,24.   Their deaths touched off three days of racial disturbances inJanuary.   Farina, who will rule on Black's motion for change of venueafter hearing more testimony and arguments today, said Tuesday hedidn't need to hear lengthy testimony about the possibility ofviolence.   ``There very well may be post-trial difficulties,'' said Farina.``But we don't need individuals testifying to that.''   One person was killed, 11 others were wounded by gunfire and 13buildings were burned in the rioting after Lloyd was shot whilebeing chased by police. Blanchard was fatally injured when themotorcycle crashed.   The defense attorney had subpoenaed scores of witnesses andwanted to enter newspaper clippings, videotapes and other documentsinto evidence to show that public agencies were preparing for moreviolence.   ``Jurors are going to think if they find my client guilty, thereis not going to be a riot, but if they find not guilty, there isgoing to be a riot,'' Black said. ``It's unfair for ordinary peopleto have that much responsibility on their shoulders.''   But Farina threw out most of the subpoenas and limited the riottestimony during the change of venue hearing to police reports fromfour previous racial disturbances in the 1980s, all of whichresulted after a jury found a policeman was innocent of shooting ablack man.   The judge and attorneys decided Monday to seat a large jury pooljust before the change of venue motions so the panel could beordered to avoid reading or listening to testimony on the motions.   Prosecutors sought to quash Black's subpoenas, but did notdispute the threat of violence in case of acquittal.   ``There is a degree of probability that a riot will occur,''said Roy Wood, an assistant Dade County attorney.   Police have acknowledged contingency plans for a post-trialriot, including the purchase of 700 gas masks, arrangements for useof two armored vehicles and the possible use of the Orange Bowl tohouse those arrested during any disturbances.   Farina said careful questioning of potential jurors shoulddetermine whether their deliberations will be affected by thechance of possible riots.   ``I have no doubts that there are a number of individuals inthis community who will accept that responsibilty, as difficult asit may be,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
