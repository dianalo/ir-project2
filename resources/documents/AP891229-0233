ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The once-raucous takeover business ended the1980s subdued and humbled as the value of corporate acquisitionsplunged more than 60 percent in the fourth quarter from thestratospheric levels of a year earlier.   There were 935 acquisitions valued at $72.2 billion announcedduring the last quarter of 1989. A year earlier, when the mergerbusiness reached its zenith with the record $24.53 billion buyoutof RJR Nabisco Inc., there were two fewer deals, 933, but theacquisitions totaled a record $183.1 billion.   Leveraged buyouts, the debt-financed deals so popular a yearago, dropped even more sharply. There were 22 LBOs announced duringthe fourth quarter of 1989, totaling $15.5 billion _ down 85percent from the 49 deals worth $102.2 billion in the last quarterof 1988.   The figures, compiled by the financial research firm SecuritiesData Corp., were unsurprising. The takeover business has beendevastated over the past year by the failure of Campeau Corp.'s$6.6 billion buyout of Federated Department Stores Inc. and thesubsequent collapse of the market in junk bonds, the high-interestsecurities used to finance many buyouts.   The enthusiasm that takeover strategists and their bankers oncedisplayed was replaced by caution in 1989. Over the year, 1,447purchases of U.S. businesses worth a total of $362.7 billion wereannounced, down 29 percent in value from the 1,543 acquisitionsworth $511.5 billion in 1988.   Securities Data considered transactions worth $10 million ormore in compiling its figures.   The 1989 record of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the companythat bought RJR Nabisco, is an illustration of how times havechanged.   In 1988, Kohlberg Kravis, considered the leader among leveragedbuyout firms, announced four transactions worth $27.88 billion.Excluding RJR Nabisco, the company's other deals totaled $3.35billion.   But in 1989, Kohlberg Kravis participated in one deal worth just$310 million, the buyout of several small divisions of MacmillanInc.   Kohlberg Kravis likely adopted the same cautious stance thatother prospective acquirers have had to take.   Ruth Pachman, a spokeswoman for the firm, declined to say thatKohlberg Kravis had become more conservative. However, she said,``They're not going to do a deal for the sake of doing a deal.''   Kohlberg Kravis, although buoyed by the stellar performance ofRJR Nabisco this year, has had to contend with financial problemsat some of its smaller units that may have put a crimp into some ofits acquisition plans.   Earlier this week, Hillsborough Holdings Corp., formed as partof Kohlberg Kravis' takeover of homebuilder Jim Walter Corp., filedfor federal bankruptcy court protection.   Another Kohlberg Kravis company, Seaman Furniture Co. has beenforced to reschedule its debt payments, and a third company, SCITelevision Inc. also is trying to renegotiate its debt.   The slowdown in takeovers also was evident in financing of dealsand merchant banking activity, Securities Data said.   There were 67 junk bond offerings raising a total of $14.1billion in 1989, with $4 billion of that amount attributable tojust one deal, the RJR Nabisco buyout. In 1988, there were 90 junkbond offerings that raised $16.4 billion, Securities Data said.   Meanwhile, major investment banks participated directly in 82deals worth $24.8 billion this past year. In 1988, there were 83such transactions, but they totaled $95.5 billion, faroutdistancing the 1989 total.</TEXT></DOC>
