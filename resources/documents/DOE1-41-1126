Changes in soft brown coalproperties during treatment are considered as artificial coalification.The treated coal equals glance brown coal in regard to element contentand reflection values. Changes observed include: decrease in oxygen andhumic acid content; destruction of coal gel structure; conversion ofsodium and calcium humate, thus reduction of organically bound ash compoundsand salt removal from saliniferous brown coal; increase in content ofcoal soluble in organic solvents and also thermal separation of carbon-sulfurbonds, thus release of hydrogen sulfide and decrease in coal sulfur contentup to 40%. It was furthermore noted that slurry of treated coal remainsflowable up to a 50% solids content (30% for untreated brown coal suspension).Additionally, treated coal proved to be a superior material for coalliquefaction than untreated coal: yield of pentane soluble hydrogenationextracts was 60 to 70% of coal mass and was also reached within shorthydrogenation time. 9 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
