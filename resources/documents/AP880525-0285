(AP) The lawmaker proposing a statewidecooling-off period for handgun sales Wednesday withdrew a versionof his bill weakened by legislators he accused of knuckling underto the National Rifle Association.   ``I cannot personally allow the bill in its current posture tocome out with my name on it,'' said Rep. Ron Silver, a Democratfrom North Miami Beach.   ``The National Rifle Association is a very powerful, financiallysecure organization and the Legislature is responding more to theNational Rifle Association than to the people of Florida.''   Silver distributed a memo to the other 119 House membersdecrying a Tuesday vote that reduced his proposed weeklong waitingperiod to three working days at the option of each county. Theproposed constitutional amendment would have been put to voters ina November referendum.   State law already allows counties to enact waiting periods of upto two days.   A lobbyist for the NRA dismissed Silver's claims that theassociation was improperly influencing lawmakers.   ``He knows that's not true,'' said Marion Hammer, director ofthe Unified Sportsmen of Florida, the NRA's Florida arm. ``There'sno hue and cry out there for waiting periods. ... He only wants tolet the people decide if he can pick the question. Who's foolingwho?''   Silver said he will mount a petition drive to place theseven-day question on the ballot anyway, which will require him tocollect several hundred thousand signatures of registered votersacross the state by August.   If that drive succeeds and voters adopt the constitutionalamendment, Silver said he would push separate legislation torequire gun buyers to sign their intent to purchase weapons. Thecurrent 48-hour waiting period, which several counties haveenacted, has been faulted because it doesn't require written intentto purchase a weapon.   Rep. Ron Johnson, who sponsored the amendment to weaken Silver'sproposal as well as last year's controversial law that made iteasier for Floridians to carry concealed weapons, responded toSilver's memo by telling his colleague, ``I find it personallyoffensive.''</TEXT></DOC>
