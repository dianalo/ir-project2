(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Space shuttle Columbia will not takeoff until next week at the earliest after a fuel leak scrubbedWednesday's launch, NASA officials said.   Columbia had been scheduled to lift off at 12:38 a.m. EDT with a$150 million observatory called Astro. But it was called off aboutsix hours before launch time when hydrogen began leaking whileColumbia's external fuel tank was being loaded.   Workers were expected to enter Columbia's rear enginecompartment early Thursday to search for the leak and assess theproblem. But first all the hydrogen must be vented from theexternal tank and the system must be purged with non-flammablehelium.   ``It's hard to believe at the rate (of) leak we've seen that wemissed it,'' said Bascom Murrah, a NASA official in charge ofpre-launch operations for Columbia. ``Something gave. But it's aguessing game until we get in there.''   It was the first time a shuttle launch had been scrubbed duringfueling. More than a half-million gallons of super-cold liquidhydrogen and liquid oxygen were being pumped into Columbia'sexternal tank.   ``The system was tight going into launch count, and it passedall of our standard leak tests. We felt good about it,'' said NASAlaunch director Bob Sieck. ``The problem did not manifest itselfuntil we saw cold cryogenic temperatures. Of course, it is our hopethat it is still there under ambient conditions when we go into ourtroubleshooting.''   Columbia's seven astronauts returned to their home base atJohnson Space Center in Houston on Wednesday. They planned topractice liftoffs and landings in a shuttle mission simulator whileawaiting a new launch date.   Engineers for the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationspent hours opening and closing valves and watching a network ofsensors before finding the general area of the leaks late Tuesday.   A 17-inch valve in a pipe that carries fuel from the externaltank to the shuttle's main engines was believed to have a leak thesize of a pinhole, Sieck said.   Sieck said hydrogen leaked for fewer than five minutes beforethe fueling was halted. Readings showed hydrogen inside the aft endof Columbia as well as outside the orbiter.   Hydrogen also leaked from equipment on the launch platform, butthat was minor and would not have prevented NASA from proceedingwith the launch, Murrah said.   If the problem is ``something obvious that we can repair on thepad, then we'll do that and fly,'' Murrah said.   Sieck said given those circumstances, the middle of next weekwould be the earliest another launch could be attempted.   A worse-case scenario would mean rolling Columbia back to itshangar, which likely would mean a delay of about a month, Murrahsaid.   ``There is still maybe some unknown that we can check or testevery aspect of the (valve) between the orbiter and the externaltank in the current configuration at that pad,'' Sieck said.   ``However, it's a technical problem and with technical problemswe can find them. We will find it and we will fix it and we willget on with (the mission). There's just a schedule uncertainty asto when we'll be there.''   In either case, NASA plans to open Columbia's payload bay onFriday and replenish the argon supply of Astro's X-ray telescope,Sieck said. The telescope constantly needs argon so its instrumentsremain cold. The job is expected to take more than two days butcould be done in conjunction with other work.   NASA said Wednesday it would proceed as planned with Friday'sscheduled launch of a German X-ray observatory known as Rosat. Theobservatory will be boosted into orbit by an unmanned Delta rocket.   Columbia's nine- to 10-day mission with Astro will be the 36thshuttle flight and the first one in five years devoted entirely toscientific research. The observatory's four telescopes will examineultraviolet light and X-rays emitted from extremely hot stars andgalaxies. Such radiation is invisible from the ground.</TEXT></DOC>
