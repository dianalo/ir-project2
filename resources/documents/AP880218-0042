Shultz and congressional leaders today byvisiting Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   The importance of the weapons with ranges below 315 miles hasloomed larger in recent months in planning by the North AtlanticTreaty Organization for its defenses once intermediate-rangenuclear forces are eliminated under a treaty with the Soviet Union.   Short-range missiles are of particular concern to the Bonngovernment because Germany would be the battleground if they areused.   The West German government says the upgrading of short-rangemissiles should be linked to an overall reduction in the number ofthe weapons and to progress in efforts to reduce the Sovietsuperiority in conventional weapons in central Europe.   The West Germans say NATO first must develop an overall armsstrategy and iron out differences within the alliance beforeembarking on missile modernization programs.   ``(West Germany) sees no need for an isolated decision onmodernizing or not modernizing particular nuclear weapon systems atthis point,'' Friedhelm Ost, chief government spokesman, said thisweek.   Kohl arrived Wednesday and planned to meet with President Reaganon Friday.   U.S. officials said before Kohl's arrival that West Germany hadgone along with the modernization decision when it was made in 1983and reaffirmed that support two months ago, and that the Sovietsbenefited from the new concerns.   ``No alliance allows its forces to defend itself... with weaponsfrom yesteryear,'' said Rozanne Ridgway, assistant secretary ofstate for European affairs.   Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:``It is unfortunate ... the Soviets have managed somehow to jumpright into the middle of all this and to suggest that there issomehow disarray in the alliance, a crisis in the alliance on thequestion of modernization.''   The chancellor also is expected to renew calls for quick Senateratification of the U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate medium- andshorter-range nuclear missiles _ those that have a range of 315 to3,000 miles.   The accord, which calls for reductions in the next three years,was signed in Washington in December.   West German officials said Kohl also is likely to press for aworldwide ban on chemical weapons.   In a related development, government spokesman HerbertSchmuelling denied news reports that Kohl would travel to Moscowthis fall.</TEXT></DOC>
