Each year, millions of new credit cards are delivered through the mail, often in envelopes hailing the plastic card inside. That makes the postal system one of the weakest links in the cards' chain of custody, giving mail sorters and letter carriers easy and constant access to a rich vein of plastic gold.    Last year, postal theft accounted for about $62 million, or 13%, of all credit-card losses, according to H. Spencer Nilson, author of an industry newsletter. To reduce the number of thefts, credit-card issuers and the postal service are changing the ways they do business.    Banks that issue credit cards have begun disguising their mailings, even to the point of distributing cards in plain, unmarked envelopes. &quot;Ours are mailed out in envelopes that don't indicate there's a card inside,&quot; says William Buckley, senior executive vice president of Southwest State Bank Association in Dallas.    And some banks concoct multiple disguises. First National Bank of Chicago, for instance, is one of the few that periodically alters its mailing envelopes &quot;to help combat the problem,&quot; says Peter Soraparu, an assistant vice president. But the technique is limited by the versatility of a card issuer's envelope-making equipment.    &quot;Sometimes changing the envelopes is impossible,&quot; says Edward Barber, fraud investigations manager for Bankcard Security, the security unit of Marine Midland Bank in New York.    For its part, the postal service is installing more automated mail-sorting machines -- not just to improve productivity but to reduce the theft of credit cards whizzing through the system, says Al Brown, a postal inspector in Houston. In the same vein, postal officials are offering reduced mailing rates and taking other steps to encourage use of nine-digit ZIP codes by card issuers. The codes allow the post office to sidestep manual sorting and, thus, reduce the number of people who have access to mailed credit cards.    In a more low-tech approach, post offices in Pasadena, Calif., and several other cities have installed overhead catwalks so that postal inspectors can watch employees handling the mail.    Postal inspectors also watch for clusters of credit cards reported missing in the same ZIP code. Such a pattern enabled Mr. Brown, the postal inspector, to nab a mail carrier who had stolen several cards and had given them to girlfriends, who racked up $200,000 in charges. &quot;When it's one (missing card) in a ZIP code, I usually won't react,&quot; Mr. Brown says. &quot;But when it's five or six, it's really obvious.&quot;    No amount of gadgetry and security can remove the temptation of stealing a credit card, which is virtually as good as cash. Postal workers can easily sell stolen cards in a flourishing black market, where they command a price of at least $250 each, according to security experts. A member of one credit-card theft ring told a congressional committee in 1983 that the main sources for stolen cards were prostitutes and postal employees.    Although the thievery involves only a fraction of the service's 800,000 employees, the rate is increasing. Arrests for internal theft rose about 30% last year, to 753, with most of the publicly reported cases involving credit cards. Fred Gray, manager of the Internal Crimes branch of the Postal Service in Washington, attributes much of the jump to an increase in the number of postal workers. But some inspectors see other reasons.    &quot;Narcotics and greed&quot; are two of the biggest problems, says Mr. Brown, who finds that many wrongdoers are trying to support drug habits. In more than half the cases caught by postal inspectors, the perpetrators are temporary employees, whose backgrounds aren't checked as thoroughly as full-time workers. Postal inspectors complain that a government computer system that allows them to check criminal records can be used after they arrest a suspect, but that they aren't allowed to make such checks as a condition of employment.    &quot;You do have some (employees) with sticky fingers,&quot; says Carl Martin, a postal inspector in Houston. &quot;I know it sounds terrible -- postal workers stealing any mail -- but we recognize that we're all humans.&quot;    On occasion, a case involves a most trusted employee. A mailman in West Palm Beach, Fla., was honored by the city commission in April for saving the lives of two elderly women who were in a car accident. Later that week, he was arrested and charged with using a credit card from his mail pouch to buy $110.25 worth of jewelry. The case is pending. </TEXT></DOC>
