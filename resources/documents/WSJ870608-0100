The new policy, as expected, calls for the purchase of at least 10 nuclear-powered submarines capable of operating under the Arctic ice. The Canadian armed forces currently don't have any vessels that can be deployed year-round in the Arctic.    The Arctic initiative is designed to counter potential Soviet threats in the far north and to respond to an Arctic sovereignty challenge from Canada's closest ally, the U.S. Washington doesn't recognize Canadian claims to jurisdiction over the waters between Canada's Arctic islands. The two countries are trying to negotiate a settlement of their differences.    Defense Minister Perrin Beatty, who announced the new defense policy in Parliament, said, &quot;The Arctic has emerged as an area of strategic importance for submarine operations, raising both security and sovereignty concerns for this country.&quot; Arctic sovereignty has been a major political issue in Canada since the summer of 1985 when the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Sea made an unauthorized voyage through Arctic waters.    The new submarines, which are expected to be purchased from either France or Britain, will operate mainly on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. But they will be deployed regularly in the Arctic to protect against incursions there. Mr. Beatty said the Pacific deployment will recognize Canada's increasingly important strategic interests in the Pacific area.    Opposition party spokesmen attacked the planned submarine purchase as a misuse of limited defense funds by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative government. A U.S. official also expressed concern that it will draw funds away from more important areas, such as modernizing obsolete Canadian defense equipment. A public opinion poll last week reported that 55% of Canadians were opposed to Canada buying nuclear-powered submarines.    The Canadian Centre for Arms Control and Disarmament, a government-financed advisory agency, said the Canadian Defense Department has exploited the sovereignty threat to the Arctic to try &quot;to secure public acceptance of an extravagant submarine program.&quot; The agency asserted that the Defense Department's main reason for seeking the submarines is to use them in the Atlantic and Pacific -- a move most Canadians would reject -- rather than in the Arctic.    The new defense policy, the first major change in strategy in 16 years, pledges that the government will increase defense spending, adjusted for inflation, by at least 2% a year for the next 15 years. Outlays for major new projects, including the nuclear submarines, will push spending above the 2% annual level, the Defense Department said. For the current year the defense budget totals 10.2 billion Canadian dollars ($7.7 billion).    Replacing obsolete equipment is a pressing need. The navy's newest ship is 14 years old and the oldest, at 31 years, is older than most of those who sail on her, the Defense Department said. Canada cut back on its defense spending during much of the administration of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who held office for almost 16 years. Canada ranks near the bottom among North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations in defense spending as a percentage of gross domestic product.    The new policy document calls for the purchase of six new frigates in addition to six currently being built. It also provides for the purchase of mine sweepers, anti-submarine helicopters, at least six new long-range patrol aircraft and about 250 new tanks.    Although the new submarines will be nuclear-powered, they won't be nuclear-armed. &quot;Canada has no nuclear weapons and no intention of acquiring them,&quot; the document said.    As expected, the government said it will cancel an &quot;unsustainable commitment&quot; to send, in time of crisis, a Canadian-based brigade group and two fighter squadrons to northern Norway. The brigade group will be used instead in central Europe, allowing the Canadian army to field a division-size force in a crisis.    The government said it will increase Canada's reserve forces to 90,000 from the current 51,000 by the end of the 15-year planning period. </TEXT></DOC>
