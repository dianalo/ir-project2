<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-48-0250 </DOCNO><TEXT>The interaction of monochromatic Alfven waves with toroidally trappedparticles in tokamaks, in the regime of intrinsic stochasticity, wasinvestigated theoretically. The velocity and radial position changesof banana regions due to the instability in question were studied forboth the plasma electrons and thermonuclear alpha particles. As for theelectrons, random banana motions were found for wave fields higher than100 V/m; they were illustrated by numerical results. The induced radialdiffusion exceeded neoclassical diffusion. On the other hand, at leastfor realistic wave amplitudes, alpha particles did not enter a largerscale stochasticity. (J.U.). 6 figs., 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
