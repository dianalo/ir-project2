This isn't investing or even speculation. It's called dividend-capture trading: briefly owning high-yield stocks just to get a company's payout. It's happening more often, accounting for 25% or more of Big Board volume on some days. And it's changing the way investment specialists, regulators and others view the market.    Many brokers and exchange officials regard this practice as harmless, or even as a welcome bit of excitement. It brings in commissions and increases what otherwise would be anemic trading volume. Big U.S. money managers figure they win, too, making a little extra money by briefly lending their high-yield stocks to foreigners for capture trading.    Critics, however, say the practice is a travesty of the way stock markets should function. They argue that it distorts trading figures and adds weight to the current argument that the stock market is artificially driven by program trading and other mechanisms that have little to do with the capital building of U.S. business.    &quot;These aren't real trades,&quot; argues Ronald Bechky, a trader at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. Adds Robert Farrell, the head of market analysis at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.: &quot;I wonder if there's too much swapping of stock being done by someone who doesn't have any fundamental interest in a company.&quot;    Frantic dividend trading also upsets technical analysts, who study market statistics to gauge where stocks are headed. &quot;It messes up a lot of indicators,&quot; says Alan Shaw, a senior vice president of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. &quot;Usually, heavy volume is the weapon of the bull,&quot; he says. But it's hazardous to draw such lessons from sudden bursts of dividend-related trading, Mr. Shaw says.    Nonetheless, &quot;the share of dividend captures keeps going up&quot; while traditional stock trading keeps atrophying after the October stock-market crash, says Richard Wines, a vice president at the investor-relations firm of Georgeson andamp; Co.    Of Monday's stock-market volume of 155 million shares, for example, 48 million came in GTE Corp., which was about to pay its dividend. Leading the torrent of GTE trading were two Japanese brokers, Yamaichi Securities Co. and Nomura Securities Co., acting on behalf of Tokyo insurance firms. At 9:40 a.m., Yamaichi blistered the New York Stock Exchange tape with a trade of 10 million shares of GTE. At $35.75 a share, it was the biggest trade of the day, amounting to more than $350 million.    Within three minutes, Yamaichi's client unloaded every GTE share it had just bought. The only trace of its presence: Yamaichi had neatly stripped the telecommunications company's 63-cent dividend from all 10 million shares -- producing about $6 million in dividend income for Japanese clients. Some similar trades later in the day were pushed through so fast that a big sale ran on the tape before the buy.    Because of a quirk in Tokyo's regulations, Japanese life insurers are ravenous for dividend income, and some are a bit embarrassed about the lengths they go to to get it. &quot;We must admit this kind of investing isn't healthy,&quot; says Izumi Kakimoto, a portfolio manager at Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Co.'s New York office.    A lot of U.S. financial heavyweights, however, don't mind the current arrangement one bit. Brokers are glad to get any business these days, even low-profit dividend-related trades. At the New York Stock Exchange, such trades have kept reported volume around 170 million shares daily, softening the drop from last year's record pace.    &quot;Volume is volume,&quot; says Richard Grasso, the president-elect of the New York Stock Exchange. &quot;We don't take any position on it, good, bad or indifferent.&quot; He acknowledges that some traders don't think dividend-capture trades should be reported in general stock-market volume. But he believes &quot;the public is entitled to see the totality of {trading} activity&quot; -- dividend captures and all.    Susumu Uchiama, the head of equity trading at Yamaichi's U.S. unit, observes that &quot;dividend-capture trading started a couple of years ago and has been growing pretty fast since then.&quot; Until about a year ago, U.S. brokers such as Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. did most of the trades, but they have been eclipsed lately by Japanese securities firms.    As for companies like GTE, they used to worry that huge volume spurts might signal a predator's raid. Now they just watch this frenzied paper-shuffling with bemusement. &quot;We're bystanders,&quot; says Ellen Myers, an investor-relations official at GTE. &quot;It doesn't move the stock; we just sit here and watch it happen.&quot;    Japanese life insurers need all that dividend income because they are obligated to pay 7% to 8% annual yields to holders of whole life policies, explains Yasuda's Mr. Kakimoto. But Japanese regulations say these payments must come from dividend income, not capital gains. That's awkward for the insurers, who have plenty of capital gains from Japanese investments but skimpy dividend income.    That's where U.S. stocks come in. By buying high-yield stocks like GTE, electric utilities, or even some bank and auto stocks, Japanese insurers can switch old capital gains into new dividend income. The Japanese buy a high-yield stock just before it pays its dividend, then sell it almost simultaneously -- avoiding any risk of owning a falling stock for even a day or two. The trick is to arrange for a day's delay in settling the stock sale, so it's made without the dividend.    That's what happened Monday with GTE. Brokers estimate that of the 48 million shares traded, at least 20 million shares were accounted for by Japanese life insurers buying for the dividend. Another 20 million were those same insurers selling the stock right afterward.    On Yamaichi's big GTE trade, the securities firm arranged for its client to buy borrowed stock at $35.75 a share, then sell it right away at $35.125 or $35 a share. Those sales were marked as &quot;seller's option.&quot; That meant Yamaichi's client would keep the dividend and settle the trade the next day -- at an agreed-upon lower price to reflect the next buyer's loss of the dividend.    Big U.S. money managers are happy to play along. They lend their stocks to Japanese brokers around dividend time. In return, they get several days' interest on collateral, as well as a payment to offset the loss of the dividend. The College Retirement Equities Fund, for one, made an extra $11.5 million doing this sort of stock lending last year.    &quot;It's a big business,&quot; says a stock-lending specialist at a major Midwestern bank. He alone has been lending more than two million GTE shares to Japanese and U.S. brokers this week. &quot;But the trades are invisible to U.S. holders,&quot; the stock-lending specialist adds.    The College Retirement Equities Fund also has been doing its share of securities &quot;lending&quot; this week, making nearly all its 899,000 GTE shares available to Japanese dividend players. While Japanese insurers collect GTE's actual dividend, long-term U.S. holders such as the college fund get an equivalent cash payment from brokers. Since most pension-related money managers are tax-exempt, they needn't worry about tax consequences of such dealings.    As quickly as these trades glide through, they would go even faster if brokers just posted a big trade on the New York Stock Exchange and didn't line up actual shares from U.S. institutions. But the Big Board wouldn't like that. Two big securities firms say the stock exchange has picked over their trading recently to make sure that shares really are changing hands. Both firms add that they have been given a clean bill of health.    The mechanics of these trades are drawing the attention of Sen. William Proxmire, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. An aide says the Wisconsin Democrat intends to draft a letter to David Ruder, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, asking &quot;if he thought there were any risks to the financial industry from these trades.&quot; Of particular interest, the aide says, is that brokers generally start these trades by selling borrowed shares. But the aide, Robert Johnson, acknowledges that the dividend-capture inquiry isn't a top priority.    As for brokers handling these giant trades, they come out with penny-a-share commissions. That's much less than the usual six or seven cents a share on institutional business. But in a market slump like the current one, every bit helps. The big volume also is good for Japanese brokers' prestige: It makes them look like much bigger players in the U.S.    Still, the Japanese insurers are hoping Tokyo's rules will be changed to make dividend ploys unnecessary. The latest guessing: Some new regulations might emerge in April 1989. So, for now, they're stuck with such dividend games.    On Wednesday, the dividend-trading whirlwind descended on Philadelphia Electric Co., which traded 65 million shares. The stock yields 12% and went ex-dividend yesterday. Also on the calendar for similar volume fireworks are Tenneco Inc., Sonat Inc. and Ohio Edison Co., all of which pay hefty dividends in the next few weeks.    Some U.S. securities firms are practicing a smaller-scale variant on dividend capture, too. They focus on companies with dividend-reinvestment plans, which let holders use dividends to buy more stock at a 5% discount. If other holders don't want to take advantage of this feature, these traders will buy big blocks of the stock, cash in on the dividend-reinvestment option, and then quickly sell all the shares.    Such a strategy appeared to underlie much of yesterday's trading in Texas Utilities, which was the most active stock on the Big Board, with composite volume of 5.9 million shares.    As dividend-related trading mounts, Merrill Lynch's Mr. Farrell thinks it might make sense to segregate it from regular stock-market volume. That would provide a better gauge of what traditional investors are doing, he says.    &quot;But then somebody else would say: Let's leave out arbitrage trading, too,&quot; Mr. Farrell says. &quot;Pretty soon you'd find out there's nobody else in the market.&quot;    ---                    Rapid Trading in GTE   A look at May 16 trading in GTE Corp. shaows how huge blocks of stocks are snapped upo by dividend-capture traders, then unloaed moments later.
