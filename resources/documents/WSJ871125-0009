That's because firms that sell the handful of portfolio-insurance products to retail investors guaranteed to make up some of the losses if the &quot;insurance&quot; strategies themselves didn't work.    Now, many firms are raising the cost of such protection. And critics are raising increasing doubts about whether the portfolio-insurance offerings are a good deal for long-term investors.    &quot;These products are alluring in design, but it's tough to really know the price of that short-term protection,&quot; says Jeremy Duffield, a senior vice president in charge of product development at the Vanguard Group of mutual funds. &quot;They may have value as short-term tactical products for people frozen in indecision about whether to be in or out of the market, but we're concerned that the long-term investor who thinks this is a way to invest more safely will be very disappointed with his long-term rate of return.&quot;    Portfolio insurance for individuals comes in several forms, including hedged index mutual funds, certificates of deposit with rates of return tied to the performance of the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, and similar index-linked limited partnerships. The bank CDs include both bull-market versions, which pay investors a percentage of any rise in the Sandamp;P index, and a rarer bear-market variety, which pays a percentage of any decline.    Though they differ in design, all of these products involve option-like hedging strategies, operated through futures trading, that promise participation in stock-market returns with protection against market losses. Some of the offerings also provide ironclad guarantees against losses.    A $230 million limited partnership marketed by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. guarantees that net asset value will never drop more than 10% a year -- even if the hedge used to provide the portfolio insurance goes awry. The firm says that the net asset value of the partnership, known as the Growth and Guarantee Fund, is currently down 13%. But it says the value will be back up to at least the promised minimum by the partnership's first birthday next autumn, without the help of the extra guarantee.    Market-indexed CDs, like other bank deposits, guarantee investors' principal in full; deposits are insured by the federal government up to $100,000. Safety has a cost, however. Take the case of investors who enthusiastically bought one-year CDs linked to a rise in the Sandamp;P 500 during last summer's stock-market euphoria. While they may be grateful their capital is still intact, they are stuck with zero-yielding investments they can't get out of before next summer when the CDs mature.    Even if stock prices do go their way, prescient investors will get only a fraction of the gains they would have gotten through direct participation in the market. And this is even truer today than it was before Black Monday's 508-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    Because disrupted futures prices and the sharp rise in stock-market volatility have increased their hedging costs, some of the banks and brokerage firms that offer portfolio-insurance products for individuals have made the terms much less advantageous than before the crash.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and First National Bank of Chicago actually pulled their index-linked CDs from the market due to the abnormal jump in volatility. First Chicago resumed marketing them last week, and Shearson says it intends to do so soon. But in both cases terms will be much skimpier. &quot;Price is a function of volatility, and volatility now is so high,&quot; says Robert Rice, senior vice president at Shearson.    Other issuers of index-linked CDs decided to weather the market's gyrations, but only by passing on higher costs to investors. For instance, when volatility was at normal levels, terms of Chase Manhattan Bank's one-year bull-market CD promised investors a 70% to 75% share of gains in the Sandamp;P index. Now, the terms of participation have been slashed to only 37% of any market rebound. For Chase's one-year bear-market CD, the interest rate today would be equal to only 45% of any drop in the Sandamp;P index during that term, instead of 105% before the crash.    Fleet National Bank of Providence, R.I., and Northern Trust Co. in Chicago have similarly cut participation levels in their market-index CDs. Merrill Lynch refuses to comment on the Growth and Guarantee Fund except to say that its hedging model adjusts for changes in volatility.    For investors, the new terms for the index-linked CDs mean the market would have to make a much bigger move in order for these products to pay the equivalent of going CD rates. For Chase's one-year products, for example, the market would have to advance 20.3% in the bull version or decline 16.7% in the bear version to match a 7.5% interest rate on a regular CD; under the old terms, the market moves would only have to have been 10% on the upside or 7.14% on the downside.    &quot;We're waiting for the dust to settle,&quot; says Nigel Gardner, the Chase vice president who manages the index-linked CD products. &quot;We feel the product is more valid today than previously because security of principal is ever more important to investors.&quot;    In contrast, index mutual funds that employ portfolio insurance don't have any extra guarantees if the hedge goes wrong. That means investors remain directly exposed to the kind of recent disruptions in futures markets that bedeviled institutional users of portfolio insurance. Any insurer who was forced to sell futures to implement a hedge when futures were selling at a 20% discount automatically failed to stop losses at promised levels.    Equity Guard, an actively managed closed-end fund from Skye Investment Advisors Inc. uses portfolio insurance to ensure that net asset value doesn't fall below its June 30 level on a year-by-year basis. It fell about 7% (compared with a drop of about 18% in the Sandamp;P 500 since June 30). The portfolio-insurance program caused the fund to move assets to 90% in cash, and Skye vice president David Welch says that interest income will help boost net asset value close to the targeted minimum level by next June 30. The fund currently sells at a 16% discount and is slated to become an open-end fund in January.    MarketGuard Appreciation Fund, an open-ended index fund from Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.'s Webster Capital Management subsidiary was luckier. Using a more conservative six-month hedge horizon, it was fully out of the market by Oct. 16. &quot;We did very well, thanks to a combination of dumb luck and a very conservative investment strategy,&quot; says the fund's manager Jon Jankus.    According to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., which tracks mutual fund performance, MarketGuard fell only 3% in the fateful Oct. 15-29 period, compared with an average loss of close to 21% for Lipper's 857-fund universe -- the 16th best performance of the group.    But there's a flip side. &quot;In an up market,&quot; says Mr. Jankus, &quot;the price of the hedge costs 6 to 7 percentage points of performance.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
