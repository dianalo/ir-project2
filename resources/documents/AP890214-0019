The petition Monday by Greenpeace says the department couldrequire schools and other institutions receiving money from it tobuy their milk in cartons made of unbleached paper, glass or someother material that is biodegradable and not putting the toxicchemical in milk.   The department provides some 5 billion half-pint cartons of milka year through five different subsidy programs.   Greenpeace was relying on a Canadian government study reportedlast fall that found dioxin leaching from cartons of bleached paperinto the milk. No government agencies have tested milk in the UnitedStates.   Milk's high fat content appears to attract dioxin from the paper,according to Janet Hieber of Greenpeace. ``If the carton were filledwith water instead of milk, chances are the dioxin would have stayedin the carton,'' she said.   Washington television station WJLA conducted its own tests andfound dioxin in school milk at concentrations similar to those foundin Canada, according to Roberta Baskin, a WJLA reporter convering aGreenpeace press conference Monday.   Dioxin is the most powerful cause of cancer ever tested in labanimals, but has not been shown to cause cancer in humans. Healthagency concerns about human cancer are based on animal studies. Inhigh doses, dioxin is a proven cause of a severe form of acne, andsome studies suggest it can cause reproductive disorders.   Paper bleached with chlorine can contain tiny amounts of dioxin,according to Environmental Protection Agency studies of paper millsreleased two years ago. EPA said the amounts in products such astoilet tissue were too small to be of concern.   The concentration in eight ounces of milk in the Canadian testsworked out to 0.6 picograms of the most potent form of dioxin perkilogram of body weight for a child of 110 pounds. That is 100 timesthe lifetime daily intake that the Environmental Protection Agencysays will increase the risk of cancer by one in a million.   EPA's risk estimates for dioxin yield higher cancer estimatesthan those used by other agencies. But even if EPA cut its riskestimate as it is proposing to do, the Canadian milk would containsix times as much dioxin as the amount that would raise the risk ofcancer by one in a million.   Chris Lecos of the Food and Drug Administration said the agencysaw no immediate threat to health that would justify action withoutfurther data. ``The basic concern is long-term exposure,'' he said.   The Canadian study, he said, ``was quite limited, 18 samples, andfrom only one area of Canada, around Halifax.''   The agency and the paper industry are beginning a more detailedstudy, said Carol Raulston, vice president for government affairs ofthe American Paper Institute, the chief trade group. She said thestudy should yield more reliable results in a few months.   ``The industry is committed to providing safe packaging and ifthere's anything they're uncomfortable with (at FDA), we'll have toaddress that,'' Ms. Raulston said.   Diane Durant, spokeswoman for the Food and Nutrition Service ofthe Agriculture Department, said her agency was reviewing materialprovided by Greenpeace.   EPA spokeswoman Alicia Tenuta said she had been unable to reachagency officials in a position to comment.</TEXT></DOC>
