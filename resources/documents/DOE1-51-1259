Postoperativeabscesses or infections were diagnosed in 9 of 20 patients. All patientswere correctly diagnosed by In-111 WBC imaging and 4 patients could notbe diagnosed by US because of bowel gas. One false-positive CT examinationand another artifact on CT images due to respiratory movements were obtained.The three modalities were found to be complementary: CT and US were efficientimaging methods for diagnosis and treatment of abscess. In-111 WBC imagingcould estimate the activity of inflammation.</TEXT></DOC>
