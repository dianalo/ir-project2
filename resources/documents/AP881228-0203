The EC has said the meat constitutes a health threat to consumers.   ``The fact is however that their own own farmers, notwithstanding their objections to growth hormones, grow their meatwith growth hormones,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy on ``CBS ThisMorning.''   ``They realize as we do that those hormones are out of the meatbefore they're slaughtered. So that's really not the issue,'' saidLeahy, D-Vt.   Both sides are locked in an acrimonious dispute which threatensto spill over into other areas of trade between America and itsEuropean allies. Two-way trade between the United States and theEuropean Community totals $150 billion annually.   On Tuesday, the Reagan administration vowed to impose $100million worth of trade sanctions against European food products,starting at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 1.   The 100 percent duties will effectively double the wholesaleprice at the U.S. border for such popular products as hams, cannedItalian tomatoes and imported wine coolers.   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the stiff dutieswill go into effect unless the Europeans back down on their ban onimported meat products which contain growth hormones.   The meat ban _ which is to be applied to all European suppliers,not just the United States _ is scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1.Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Argentina already have agreed toship only hormone-free beef to Europe.   Yeutter, who is President-elect Bush's choice for agriculturesecretary, said the European ban constituted an unfair tradepractice because there was no scientific evidence that the hormones,which are used to increase bulk, cause any health effects in humans.   The Common Market countries contend that while the scientificevidence on meat hormones is not conclusive, they have the right totake precautionary action to protect health.   In a statement, the Reagan administration said the U.S. Food andDrug Administration had determined that the daily production ofhormones in humans, even in children, is far higher than theminuscule levels left in meat from treated animals.   ``We have tried repeatedly to bring this issue to a scientificdispute settlement panel under the (General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade) in order to have it resolved,'' Yeutter said in a statement.``However, our European counterparts have blocked our efforts.''   Yeutter said the $100 million in duties roughly equals theestimated lost sales of American meat products in Europe.   But Nico Wegter, the agriculture affairs spokesman for the ECtoday disputed Yeutter's contention, saying the Europeans want theGATT dialogue to include more than a discussion of scientificarguments.   ``We would have a discussion take into account all argumentsconcerned, including the economic one, including the consumerargument and that is what the Americans don't want to have,'' saidWegter on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''   ``We have gone now to GATT because we do not accept theretaliation measures which have now been announced by the Americanadministration. We don't think that those measures are compatiblewith the GATT rules,'' Wegter added.   Also the European Commission, the executive committee of the EC,today condemned the U.S. decision to impose sanctions as ``totallyunjustifiable and contrary to international standards.''   ``Any country and thus the community has the right to takemeasures it judges necessary to protect the health of itsconsumers,'' European Commissioner Willy De Clercq said in astatement from Brussels.   The Europeans have vowed to hike duties on other U.S. products ifAmerica makes good on its threat to retaliate. U.S. officials pledgethey will counter the counter-retaliation. One proposal beingconsidered by the U.S. side is a ban on all European meat imports,worth $450 million a year.   Officials are predicting that at least the initial ban on meatcontaining growth hormones and the 100 percent duties announced byYeutter on Tuesday will take effect on Jan. 1 since there are notalks scheduled before that time.   However, officials held out hope that the dispute could still besettled early in 1989.   In Los Angeles, where President Reagan is vacationing, DeputyWhite House Press Secretary Lesley Arsht said the administration hadnot lost sight of the fact that the European Community and theUnited States are major trading partners and allies.   ``We have our differences over trade, but there is a mechanismfor resolving them and we have no reason to believe this one won'tbe resolved also,'' he said.   However, the new dispute comes at a time of simmering unhappinessbetween America and its European allies.   The Europeans are upset over continued insistence by both Reaganand Bush that all countries should scrap trade-distorting farmsubsidies over the next several years. And Americans are worriedthat despite denials to the contrary, the European Community willerect new protectionist barriers blocking American goods as part oftheir effort to create a single market for much of Europe by 1992.   The list of European products upon which the higher 100 percentduties will be imposed include beef; pork hams and shoulders,excluding those that have been boned, cooked and packed in airtightcontainers; canned tomatoes; instant coffee extracts and winecoolers containing less than 7 percent alcohol.   Also subject to the duties will be both fresh and concentratedfruit juices and pet food packaged for retail sale.   The United States had originally considered imposing $120 millionin duties, but it lowered the total after the Europeans agreed notto ban hormone-treated meat that was intended for use as pet food.   The ban on hormone-treated meat _ which also applies to Europeanmeat producers _ was to have taken effect last Jan. 1, but it wasdelayed to allow time for negotiations with Washington and to giveEuropean producers more time to adjust to the ban.   U.S. officials complain that the Common Market ban would requirea costly new government inspection system to make sure that theshipments to Europe come from the half of American cattle that arenot treated with growth hormones.   The Common Market countries are France, Britain, Ireland,Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, West Germany, Italy,Greece, Spain and Portugal.</TEXT></DOC>
