The Commodore system, called the CDTV player, consists ofan Amiga personal computer -- without keyboard or monitor --and a CD player. The system is hooked up to a television todisplay video and text.</LP><TEXT>   The CDTV Player makes the personal computer maker an earlyentrant into a market that many computer companies considerto be vast. The companies think that the home market forcomputers is finally about to pick up with the introductionof multimedia machines. For instance, they expect people tobuy encyclopedias on computer disks with video and audiocapabilities, or instructional videos that they can interactwith through the computer.   Commodore has also broken through a price barrier. ItsCDTV Player, whose shipment date wasn't specified, will costless than $1,000. Application disks will cost just $25 to$60.   Still, the market for such systems is very young and willtake time to develop. The various companies involved haven'tagreed on what technological standards they will follow, andit usually takes the market quite some time to sort out thoseissues. It's also not clear how people will use thesesystems, and whether they will want reference books or justmore games. In any case, it may take a couple of years forcompanies to produce enough application disks to make thesesystems attractive.   &quot;Commodore has a history of producing great hardware, butthey don't have enough software available,&quot; said GregDrahuschak, a securities analyst at Wheat First/Butcher andamp;Singer. &quot;That is where Commodore has always fallen short.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
