Maybe. But at the moment, there is cause for worry.   Mr. Bourassa has said he will engage in no moreconstitutional talks. He says he is reconsidering hisconstitutional options, and that he will rule out no option,including &quot;sovereignty.&quot; He has canceled celebration of theJuly 1 national holiday.</LP><TEXT>   Even so, Mr. Bourassa probably is lagging behind hisvoters. Nearly 60% of Quebeckers now say they favorsovereignty. Almost half want outright independence. TheConseil du Patronat, the employers' group that was thebulwark of the anti-separation forces in the 1980 Quebecreferendum, announced Tuesday that it wouldn't be takingsides in future debates over the province's adhesion to theCanadian confederation.   Quebec's drift toward autonomy apparently is beingwelcomed by many English Canadians. Some, especially inBritish Columbia, hope that a weakening of the Canadianconfederation would mean more self-rule for their ownprovince. Others simply are tired of the endlessconstitutional wrangling.   An autonomous Quebec need not be a disaster for thecountry. Both of the province's major political parties arecommitted to free trade and polls show that Quebeckers areamong the most pro-American of Canadians.   Whether Quebec stays in Canada or leaves, however, mattersless than whether it can overcome the temptation to cuffaround people like Harry Schick. Mr. Schick is the owner of apastry store in a suburb of Montreal. According to theMontreal Gazette, he was charged on Feb. 28 with violatingQuebec's language laws. His offense: posting a sign in hiswindow with the word &quot;welcome&quot; hand-lettered in 33 languages.This sort of behavior hardly reflects a culture that wants tojoin an increasingly liberal world trading system.   It's not just language that evokes the Quebec government'smeddlesome instincts. It is true that the province hasenjoyed an entrepreneurial boom since the 1982 recession. Andin a recent poll for Maclean's magazine, Quebeckers put morefaith in business, and less in governments and unions, thaneither English Canadians or Americans. But Quebec remains anexcessively subsidized and regulated economy. Itscorporations are disturbingly dependent on ideologicallymotivated investments by the $30 billion provincialemployees' pension fund.   When Quebec shook off its parochial and authoritarian pastin the 1960s, its economy roared forward. Even greateropportunities are open to the province today. But thebenefits of North American economic integration come with animportant condition: They can only be seized by those whounderstand that for an economy to grow, it isn't only tradethat must be free.</TEXT></DOC>
