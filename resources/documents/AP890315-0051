The decision came almost seven years after 599 residents filedthe suit seeking $23 million in compensation and a ban on nightflights by the U.S. Air Force.   Residents said the sound of jets taking off and landing at YokotaAir Base west of Tokyo had caused chronic sleeplessness and hearingproblems.   Tokyo District Judge Takeshi Ochiai ruled that the noise levels``exceeded acceptable levels'' and ordered the government to payeach resident living near the base between about $18 and $11,000each, depending on the degree of noise pollution.   But Ochiai refused to grant the residents' demand to ban theflights between 9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.   He said he could not order the government to halt the flightsbecause Yokota Base is under the jurisdiction of the U.S. military.The court also dismissed the residents' demand for futurecompensation for potential damages.   Kyodo News Service said plaintiffs' attorneys estimated the totalcompensation from the government to be about $3 million.   Under a U.S.-Japan mutual security treaty, Japan provides landand pays some of the costs for U.S. troops stationed in the country.   Residents living near Yokota Air Base filed two earlier damagesuits for noise pollution in 1976 and 1977. One case, with 41plaintiffs, is under appeal to the Supreme Court.   In that case and another involving 107 plaintiffs, the Tokyo HighCourt rejected requests for a ban on nighttime flights, but awardeddamages to the plaintiffs.   The court ruled that national defense takes precedence over otherfields of administration in promoting the public interest, even inpeacetime, and that therefore citizens should endure inconveniencescaused by military facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
