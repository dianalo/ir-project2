The HNO{sub 3} vapor is scavenged and precipitated to the groundby rain at the time of its diffusion. Then, the diffusion equation ofHNO{sub 3} vapor is solved, incorporating the washout of rain to obtainthe distribution of precipitated HNO{sub 3} on the ground in the 24 hours,by which the level and domain size of the pollution of HNO{sub 3} canbe approximately estimated. 12 references.</TEXT></DOC>
