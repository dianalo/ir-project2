The government is to decide this week whether to build a proposed$2.1 billion plant, said ministry spokesman Philippe Demeyer. ``Atthis stage the decision could still go either way.''   Using traditional energy sources could save the country up to$915 million. the study says. Electricity producers, who support theconstruction of what would be Belgium's eighth nuclear plant, havesaid non-nuclear options would cost $2.1 billion more than atomicpower.   Critics have underlined the possible environmental damage frombuilding the new plant about six miles from downtown Antwerp, nearfour other nuclear units and a cluster of chemical plants.   Belgium derives 66 percent of its energy from nuclear power andits electricity consumption is increasing by about 3 percent a year.</TEXT></DOC>
