The felts according to the inventionconsist of fibers produced by passage of the material from which theyare made through the orifices of a centrifuge. These felts are distinguishedfrom analogous felts, notably by a very low content of nonfibrous particles,by a great regularity in the fibers produced and, for a given thermalresistance, by a decrease in mass per unit of surface. The felts accordingto this invention are useful notably for thermal and acoustic insulation.</TEXT></DOC>
