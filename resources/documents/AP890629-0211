Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher told President Bush thatefforts to reach agreement with Taiwan and South Korea over the useof the driftnets by their fishing fleets have failed so far.   Under a 1987 law, Thursday was the deadline for reachingagreements on monitoring and enforcement. A 60-day time clock nowstarts running and if agreements still are not reached by the end ofthat period, the administration could impose an embargo or othertrade sanctions on Taiwanese and Korean fishery products.   Taiwanese imports, mostly tuna and shrimp, were valued at $372million last year and Korean imports, mostly pollock and oysters,were valued at $250 million.   ``We have been unable to get the guarantees we considerabsolutely necessary to protect critical marine life and valuablesalmon stocks,'' said Mosbacher. ``During this 60-day period Isincerely hope that negotiations will continue so that we can avoida disruption in our fisheries trade.''   Talks with the Taiwanese continued Thursday while talks with theKoreans may resume in July.   An estimated 700 fishing boats from Japan, Korea and Taiwan havebeen using driftnets ostensibly to fish for squid since the early1980s. The nets, which sometimes can stretch more than 30 miles inlength, have been dubbed by environmentalists as ``walls of death.''   The small-mesh, monofilament nets hang in the water snaringalmost any fish, bird or marine animal they come in contact with.   On any given day, the nets can cover more than 30,000 miles ofocean.   U.S. fishermen claim the driftnet fleets are catching NorthAmerican salmon and that runs in Alaska, Washington and Oregon havedeclined as a result of the illegal fishing.   The United States and Japan reached agreement on a driftnetenforcement and monitoring treaty last Friday. Under that one-yearagreement the Japanese will allow closer monitoring of their catchand a test program of using satellite transponders on researchvessels.   The transponders can be used to keep track of where vessels arelocated. However, the agreement fell far short of what some membersof the U.S. fishing and environmental community had wanted.   Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration, said in the past roughly half-a-dozencountries have faced possible trade sanctions for failing to reachagreement on various whaling issues with the United States.   ``In each case the countries had a change of heart and acceded toour demands,'' Gorman said.   Northwest lawmakers praised Mosbacher's action.   ``I suspect that with the threat of sanctions hanging over theirheads, driftnetting countries will be a bit more anxious to talk,''said Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash. ``If not, they better be willingto suffer the consequences.''   Unsoeld called for an international ban on the use of driftnets.   Rep. John Miller, R-Wash., said Mosbacher had ``taken a majorstep to protect U.S. salmon fisheries and the ocean environment.''   Miller said the ``piracy'' by the driftnet fleets has alreadydelivered a ``painful blow'' to the U.S. salmon supply.   ``These ships are supposedly fishing for squid, but they aretaking millions of pounds of our salmon and everything else swimmingin the ocean,'' Miller said.</TEXT></DOC>
