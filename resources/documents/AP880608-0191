Jesse Jackson said his candidacy would ``remainalive'' even as he solicited an invitation to join the ticket asvice presidential candidate.   George Bush, self-described underdog heading into the fallcampaign, received words of encouragement from President Reagan.The president also threw a jab in Dukakis' direction, saying, ``Youknow, if I listen to him long enough, I would be convinced thatwe're in an economic downturn, and that people are homeless, andpeople are going without food and medical attention, and that we'vegot to do something about the unemployed.''   With the primary season concluded, Dukakis was installed as apre-election favorite by Ladbroke's, one of London's leadingbookmakers.   But Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole predicted the publicopinion polls would soon ``start moving'' in Bush's direction.   Dukakis, who tucked away a delegate nominating majority onTuesday in the final four primaries of the year, announced in LosAngeles he was ready to begin looking for a vice presidentialrunning mate. He praised Jackson, but said neither he nor anyoneelse ``is due an offer'' to join the ticket.   That didn't sound like what Jackson wanted to hear. He said hisconstituents had ``earned the option'' of having him considered.``Consideration means an offer. It does not mean just in passing,''he said.   He later added that for some people ``maybe the vice presidencymay be a step down.'' He added, ``You understand my background? Thevice presidency is not the top but it is a long where from where Istarted.''   The contrast between Jackson on the one hand and former Dukakisrivals Sen. Paul Simon, Rep. Richard Gephardt and Bruce Babbitt onthe other couldn't have been plainer.   Simon of Illinois called a news conference in Washington todeclare that the ``verdict is in'' and he would do ``everything Ican'' to help elect the man from Massachusetts.   Former Arizona Gov. Babbitt offered his backing in a televisedinterview in California. ``It's time to come together,'' he said.``He's a good man and I'll endorse him.''   Gephardt arranged to bestow his blessing publicly when Dukakis'chartered campaign jet touched down in St. Louis for a refuelingstop en route to Boston.   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo offered an endorsement, as well, inone of the great anticlimaxes of the campaign. Cuomo once was thesubject of almost daily rumors that he would make a belated entryinto the campaign, and for months his endorsement was coveted byall the active candidates.   ``I endorse him, I endorse him, I endorse him,'' Cuomo toldpersistent reporters.   But Jackson sent alternately complimentary and confrontationalsignals to Dukakis. He said whatever differences exist between them``can be resolved,'' adding, ``Both of us are rational. Both of usare intelligent. Both of us want to win.''   At the same time, he said his campaign would ``remain alive''until the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta next month. Hesaid he would continue to seek delegates and dispatched top aidesto Mackinac Island, Mich. for a Democratic Party platform committeedrafting session.   As for the vice presidential nomination, the man who finishedsecond in dozens of primaries and caucuses tried to make it soundlike he had earned it.   Asked if he would accept the spot if it were offered _ apossibility that some Dukakis aides dismiss as wildly improbable _Jackson said, ``That's a decision I must make at that time. I'venot made the decision yet whether I'll accept it or not.''   In an interview with ABC, he said, ``Consideration does mean anoffer, it does not mean just in passing. We have earnedconsideration.''   Dukakis seemed to stiffen in response.   He agreed that Jackson had earned consideration but said ``Idon't think anyone is due an offer.''   ``But there are a great many people that are going to beconsidered and he'll be one of them and I'm not going to ruleanybody in or out at this point,'' he said in a taped interviewwith ABC.   Reagan was asked by reporters at the White House what sort ofadvice he would give to Bush in his race with Dukakis.   ``I'd say, George, wait until you and I get out there on thetrail, and start pinning him down on the things he claims, which weknow are not true,'' he replied.   Senate Republican leader Dole combined a prediction of aturnaround in the polls with an attack on Dukakis.   ``The Dukakis record stands alone and the American people don'tlike what they see. It's the same out-of-touch liberal agenda thatAmerica buried in the 1980 and 1984 landslides,'' he said.   Reflecting a view held by many Republican strategists, Doleadded that Dukakis has benefited in recent weeks from beingperceived as a moderate in contrast to Jackson.   ``But that won't sell anymore,'' he said. ``Watch, the pollswill start moving in Bush's direction.''</TEXT></DOC>
