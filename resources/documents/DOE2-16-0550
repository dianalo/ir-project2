After the appearanceof vector processors, this natural SOR method has been changed for theparallel algorithm such as hyperplane or red-black method, in which thecalculation order is modified. These methods are suitable for vectorprocessors, and more high-speed calculation can be obtained comparedwith the natural SOR method on vector processors. In this report, a newscheme named 4-colors SOR method is proposed. We find that the 4-colorsSOR method can be executed on vector-parallel processors and it givesthe most high-speed calculation among all SOR methods according to resultsof the vector-parallel execution on the Alliant FX/8 multiprocessor system.It is also shown that the theoretical optimal acceleration parametersare equal among five different ordering SOR methods, and the differencebetween convergence rates of these SOR methods are examined.</TEXT></DOC>
