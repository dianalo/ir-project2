ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's governors, after three days ofharmony, closed out their annual meeting Tuesday with anacrimonious debate over whether to change the method of amendingthe U.S. Constitution.   Present but not participating in that debate, was Gov. MichaelDukakis of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee, whoattended only the final session of the 80th meeting of the NationalGovernors Association.   The Massachusetts governor sat silent while Govs. John Sununu ofNew Hampshire and Mario Cuomo of New York, Buddy Roemer of Lousianaand Carroll Campbell of South Carolina dropped all pretense ofharmony.   ``You've turned the Constitution on its head,'' said Roemer.   When Sununu, presiding over the final session of his year as NGAchairman, suggested to Cuomo that they debate the issue ontelevision, the New York governor replied, ``I know how eager youare for the (camera's) red light, Governor Sununu.''   ``And I know how eager you are to avoid it,'' retorted Sununu.   There was minimal debate and no roll call votes as the governorsquickly approved policy positions on issues ranging from housingand jobs to transportation and tourism.   Also approved on a voice vote was a call by the governors toCongress to consider amending the Constitution to provide that if34 states agreed on a constitutional amendment, it would besubmitted to Congress, which could block it by a two-thirds vote orsend it back to the states for ratification.   Currently, amendments may be proposed by a vote of two-thirds ofeach house of Congress or by a national convention called byCongress. Amendments become part of the Constitution afterratification by legislatures of three-fourths of the states or byconventions in three-fourths of the states. Congress decides whichform of ratification should be used. State legislatures orconventions are given seven years in which to ratify mostamendments.   Many state legislatures have adopted resolutions calling for aconstitutional convention to consider an amendment to require abalanced federal budget, but the number has fallen short of thatrequired to force convening of a convention.   After the voice vote approving the proposal dealing withconstitutional amendments, Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado said theproposal ``divisive and contentious'' and asked Sununu to refer itto the NGA executive committee for further consideration.   The discussion grew a little more heated when Cuomo, concedinghe had not objected before the vote, denounced the proposal as ``ahalf-baked notion.''   Cuomo had not attended the first three days of the conferenceand Campbell noted that ``some of us have been here for the entireconference; some of us came in only for the last show.''   The debate finally was resolved when Sununu suggested that allgovernors put their views of the proposal in writing and promisedto attach them to the resolution when it was submitted to Congress.   Dukakis took part in a light moment at the close of the meeting,when he and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas stepped to the podium tomake a presentation to Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, who will bethe keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention next weekin New Orleans.   Throughout the NGA meeting, governors needled Clinton about hisoverly long speech at the Democratic convention.   Dukakis turned to Kean and presented him with a plastic shoppingbag and said, ``Just in case you have the same kind of problem he(Clinton) did, we thought you might want to take this.''   Inside the bag was an hour glass.</TEXT></DOC>
