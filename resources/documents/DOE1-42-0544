This survey ofinternational activities on energy and the environment will be restrictedto those effects which commonly operate across international boundariesand will not include such problems as the airborne chemical problemsat Bhopal, the Rhine spill at Basel or the ozone depletion by chlorofluorocarbons.The major international energy-related concerns are: (1) carbon dioxideand the possible warming of the earth; (2) sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxidesand photochemical oxidant effects on lakes, streams, forests, and structures;(3) nuclear radioactive releases from weapons testing and power plantsas they affect human health; and (4) the disposal of radioactive wasteas a possible threat for the future ground water supplies or oceans.</TEXT></DOC>
