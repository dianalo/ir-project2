(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former director of the Federal Reserve Bankof New York has been indicted on insider trading charges for ascheme to leak secret interest rate figures to a now-bankruptbrokerage firm.   A federal indictment returned Thursday charged former New JerseyBankers Association president Robert A. Rough with conspiracy tocommit fraud in the first insider trading case involving governmentsecurities, prosecutors said.   It was also the first time in the 75-year history of the FederalReserve that a director has been charged with fraud, said Samuel A.Alito Jr., the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey.   ``We believe this is an isolated case,'' Alito said. ``But wewill prosecute it vigorously to try to insure it isn't repeated inthe future.''   Rough, 49, received $47,000 in interest-deferred loans from thenow-defunct Bevill, Bresler andamp; Schulman Inc. investment firm inexchange for the rate information, the indictment charged. He was amember of the Federal Reserve Bank, part of the Fed's regionalnetwork, from 1982 to 1984.   Rough was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and securitiesfraud, two counts of bank fraud, one count each of wire fraud andsecurities fraud and two counts of making false statements to banks.   He faces 29 years in prison if convicted on all counts and finestotaling $141,000, Alito said.   Rough is accused of relaying the information by telephone fromhis executive suite at the National Bank of Sussex County, where heserved as president, and once from the New York Fed's boardroom justafter a meeting, prosecutors said at a news conference.   Bevill, Bresler made millions of dollars in government securitiestrades based on Rough's advance word about decisions made by theFederal Reserve and recommendations offered by the New York Fed onthe discount rate, the indictment said.   The discount rate is the interest rate the Federal Reservecharges on loans to commercial banks. Changes in the discount ratecan have a strong impact on world financial markets and affectinterest rates paid by consumers.   Rough's attorney, Michael Himmel, said Rough would enter a pleaof not guilty and ``vigorously contest the charges.''   Rough's home telephone number was unlisted and he could not bereached for comment. He resigned earlier this year as president ofthe National Bank.   The New York Fed is one of 12 regional banks in the FederalReserve System, all of which make recommendations every two weeks onwhether the discount rate should be changed. The national FederalReserve Board has the final say in setting the rate.   Word that discount rate information had been leaked firstsurfaced in April 1987, prompting the Fed to tighten its rules ondisclosing the rate.   The allegations came to light during the trial of Gilbert C.Schulman, Bevill, Bresler's president, on fraud charges after thefirm's $144 million collapse in April 1985. Three other principalswho pleaded guilty in the firm's collapse in exchange for theircooperation testified about Rough's allegedly passing on theinformation.   Schulman, a long-time friend of Rough's, is serving an eight-yearsentence for securities violations.   Schulman testified that Rough approached him for the $47,000 inloans, which were repaid, to buy a chunk of stock in the NationalBank of Sussex.   No arraignment date has been set.</TEXT></DOC>
