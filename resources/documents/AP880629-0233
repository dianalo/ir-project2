(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   One of the first red wolves to produceoffspring since the endangered species was reintroduced to the wildhas died, and her mate apparently has taken charge of the9-week-old pup, officials said Wednesday.   The wolf, thought to have succumbed to disease or infection, wasdiscovered Saturday at Alligator River National Wildlife Refugenear Manteo, said refuge manager John Taylor.   The pup was nowhere to be found. But two days later, a wildlifeteam spotted it trotting alongside its father in the 140,000-acrerefuge, Taylor said.   ``We are fortunate that the puppy had been weaned already,'' hesaid, adding that it was unusual for male wolves to take care oftheir offspring.   He said the male wolf apparently had been feeding the puppy theway the mother would _ by killing and eating raccoons, rabbits andother small animals and regurgitating the soft gruel.   ``It's cute _ it looks like a little dog puppy, only it's kindof mottle-colored, mostly reddish with spots of gray,'' Taylorsaid. ``We thought the prospects of our finding (it) alive wereslim.''   The female wolf was among four pairs of red wolves released intothe wild in September as part of a federal effort to save thespecies. The animals were declared extinct in the wild in 1980.   The newly orphaned pup was first spotted May 21, and another pupwas sighted soon afterward with different parents _ marking thefirst time a species previously extinct in the wild has producedoffspring after being returned to its natural environment.   Although litters average five or six pups, scientists believe nomore than one survived from either of the two litters.   The red wolf once roamed the Southeast in large numbers. But in1978, with the species teetering near extinction, the last pure redwolves were taken from the wild to a zoo in Tacoma, Wash. There,breeding in captivity encouraged biologists to try reintroducingthe animals into the wild.   At Alligator River, wildlife teams take trips into the wildevery other day to track the adult wolves via radio collars worn bythe animals, Taylor said.</TEXT></DOC>
