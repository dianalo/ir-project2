The massive government takeover was announced Tuesday asfinancial regulators scrambled to implement the first portions ofPresident Bush's Sandamp;L overhaul package.   Meanwhile, the Bush proposals were receiving initial favorablereactions from Congress although some lawmakers said they hadreservations about some aspects of the proposals, in particular the$40 billion estimated cost to taxpayers.   Officials of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., whichinsures deposits at Sandamp;Ls, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,which performs the same function at banks, predicted that within amonth they would have joint regulatory teams in place atapproximately 224 insolvent Sandamp;Ls.   The government takeover will transfer control of the Sandamp;Ls to thefederal regulators, who will oversee policy decisions made by localmanagers of the insolvent institutions.   In most cases government regulators will keep the insolventinstitutions open until Congress funds a rescue package. At thattime, the institutions are to be sold with government assistance tonew investors.   These institutions have been allowed to stay open even thoughthey were losing billions of dollars annually because regulators didnot have the money to close them down.   The Bush proposal, in addition to revamping the governmentregulatory structure, proposes raising $90 billion to bail outinsolvent institutions through a combination of $40 billion in taxdollars and higher insurance premiums paid by banks and Sandamp;Ls.   Both Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich.,and House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,pledged on Tuesday that their committees would move quickly to voteon the Bush plan.   ``When we are losing on the order of $33 million a day (from Sandamp;Loperating losses), all of us are under enormous responsibilities toget this package done,'' Riegle said.   Gonzalez predicted his panel could vote on the proposal by thefirst week in March.   The government takeover of insolvent Sandamp;Ls had been urged lastweek by the General Accounting Office, which said the sick Sandamp;Ls wereoffering high interest rates to attract deposits, thus driving upcosts for the healthy part of the industry and increasing theultimate bailout cost to the government.   Four insolvent Sandamp;Ls in Maryland, Texas, California and Floridawere taken over by the regulatory teams on Tuesday with officialssaying they were working off a priority list targeting the largestinsolvent Sandamp;Ls with the biggest rate of losses first.   The announcement of the takeovers, coming just one day after Bushunveiled his plan to deal with the Sandamp;L crisis, reflected the impactthe president's proposals were already having.   Officials said they planned to mobilize between 1,200 and 1,500regulators from four different federal agencies to handle thetakeover job in coming weeks.   Bush has called on Congress to abolish the FSLIC as a separateinsurance agency and have its functions taken over by the bankinsurance agency, the FDIC.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said he had sent out letters toall employees of the beleaugered FSLIC fund assuring them ofemployment with his agency.   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,which currently runs the FSLIC fund, said that the two agencies wereworking in ``full cooperation and harmony.''   Wall said he supported Bush's proposals, which include abolishingthe three-member bank board and putting Wall and the bank boardregulatory apparatus under the supervision of the TreasuryDepartment.   While this transfer and the actual takeover of the FSLIC by theFDIC would require congressional approval, the joint supervisoryeffort did not need congressional authorization.   Regulators from the two insurance funds said they were alsoreceiving assistance from bank auditors with the Office of theComptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve.   The four institutions the government took control of on Tuesdaywere Baltimore Federal Financial of Maryland; Freedom Savings andLoan Association of Tampa, Fla.; Pacific Savings Bank of Costa Mesa,Calif., and Gill Savings Association of Hondo, Texas.   Two of the institutions, Freedom and Gill, were already undergovernment control in a supervisory program run by Sandamp;L regulators.Under the new initiative, the Sandamp;L regulators will be joined byregulators from the FDIC.   Seidman said the government regulators will try to minimizeoperating losses, eliminate speculative lending practices and ferretout any continuing examples of insider abuse and fraud.</TEXT></DOC>
