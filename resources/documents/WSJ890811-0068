The companies said the plant, which will split natural gas liquids into components including ethane, propane, butane and condensate, will be able to process about 70,000 barrels of natural gas liquids a day. Production is expected to begin in 1992.    An official of Dow Chemical Canada, a unit of Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Mich., said the partners each would invest a maximum of C$60 million in the new plant. Other parties are considering investing in the venture, the official said, though he wouldn't identify them.    Separately, the companies said they reached an accord under which Shell Canada, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, will sell ethane to Dow Chemical Canada for its proposed C$800 million ethylene plant in Fort Saskatchewan. The plant is scheduled to begin output in 1993. Initial annual capacity is set at about one billion pounds. Ethylene, a key building block in petrochemical production, is used to make products such as plastics and antifreeze. </TEXT></DOC>
