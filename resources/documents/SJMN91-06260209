Senate President Jovito Salonga, who cast the 12th vote, declared,&quot;The treaty is defeated.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PHILIPPINE SENATE REJECTS NEW LEASE FOR U.S. NAVALBASE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The immediate future of the base, which employs 8,000 U.S. servicepersonnel, was less clear. The Philippine Constitution, adopted in 1987, callsfor the withdrawal of foreign troops by today, unless a new treaty is inplace.;   But a U.S. official noted that under terms of a U.S.-Philippinespact signed in 1966, the United States has until September 1992 to completeits withdrawal from the base.;   Polls find support for U.S.; &quot;Our presumptionis that we would await the results of the referendum,&quot; U.S. Embassy spokesmanStanley Schrager said.;   Opinion polls have indicated that a majority of theFilipino people support the continued presence of U.S. forces in the country,largely because of the enormous importance of the base to the nation's fragileeconomy.;   The proposed treaty called for the United States to pay thePhilippines $203 million in rent each year. In addition, hundreds of millionsof dollars reach the Philippines in indirect payments, and the naval baseprovides about 40,000 local jobs in an area hit hard by unemployment.;  Opponents of the treaty contended that it was too lopsided in favor of theUnited States and preserved a dependent relationship between the Philippinesand its former colonial master.;   Aquino said that while the Senate's powerto ratify the treaty was enshrined in the constitution, it was an &quot;even morebasic right&quot; of the people to participate in decision-making on matters ofnational importance.;   Untested law; Aquino set in motion a complex anduntried law that allows a popular referendum on any matter after 10 percent ofthe nation's voters sign an initiating petition.;   &quot;Once again, people poweris being called upon to break a possible stalemate where the exercise of theprerogative may not be reflective of the people's will,&quot; Aquino said in atelevised address Sunday night.;   Aquino did not specify what would beconsidered in the proposed referendum or when it might be held.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Manila, Philippines  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910916  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  419  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, September 16, 199100260209,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
