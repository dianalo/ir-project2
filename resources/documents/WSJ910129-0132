From the moment he stepped out of prison last February,the 72-year-old African National Congress leader has kept upa punishing pace, crisscrossing his country and the world inpursuit of racial harmony and the emancipation of SouthAfrica's black majority. Now, as he begins his second year offreedom after 27 years in prison, Mr. Mandela is straining togo even faster. If the violence, intolerance and mistrustthat have tortured this land for so many years aren'tconquered in 1991, he worries, then when?</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The entire nation is ready for reconciliation,&quot; he saysduring an interview in his elegant Johannesburg office. &quot;Butold attitudes die hard, very hard.&quot;   The slender statesman, deeply pained by the fact that theyear of his release was also the most violent in SouthAfrica's history, frequently checks his watch, a habit he hasonly acquired in his freedom. It is a reflection of his senseof urgency, say his colleagues. Too much time, he oftencomplains, has already been wasted.   &quot;It is time now that we should bridge the gap betweenpolitical parties on how to bring about the fundamentalchanges which are going to form the foundation of thedemocratic South Africa for which we are all fighting,&quot; hesays.   Having initiated South Africa's turn toward democracy bycultivating contacts with the white authorities while he wasstill in prison, Mr. Mandela is eager to build on themomentum of reconciliation generated at two summit meetingsbetween ANC and government leaders last year.   If Pretoria can make progress on its pledge to remove theobstacles to full negotiations -- the release of politicalprisoners and return of exiles, as well as scrappingremaining racial segregation laws -- Mr. Mandela believes thecountry can move swiftly to the business of hammering out anew constitution, which the ANC insists be constructed on thefoundation of one-man, one-vote majority rule.   &quot;It is important to alter the framework in which racialand political intolerance takes place,&quot; he says.   To that end, Mr. Mandela and the ANC opened the year byproposing an all-party conference to forge consensus ondemocratic principles across the country's wide politicalspectrum, stretching from the conservative white right to theradical black left. He will also, finally, put aside pettypolitics and meet with Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi todayin an effort to unify black organizations and end theviolence between the ANC and the Zulu-based Inkatha FreedomParty that has left more than 2,000 blacks dead.   &quot;We are sorting out problems. It is our people who aredying,&quot; Mr. Mandela says, impatiently drumming his fingers onhis desk. While he accuses a &quot;third force&quot; of conservativewhites of fueling the violence, he acknowledges that everyonemust share responsibility. &quot;The third force is takingadvantage of the political rivalry among blackorganizations,&quot; he concedes. &quot;In a way, we are also to blamefor that.&quot;   Mr. Mandela's transition from an imprisoned legend whocould do no wrong to a mortal man free to err and admitmistakes hasn't been smooth. He has stumbled several times,like any politician trying to walk the fine line betweenleading and following. His repeated return-to-school callshave been largely ignored by black youths weaned on the ANC'sstrategy of boycotts and resistance. His plea for blacks to&quot;throw your pangas {weapons} into the sea&quot; was met only byfiercer fighting. While telling world leaders thatnegotiation is the only way to resolve violent confrontation,he has not sat down with Mr. Buthelezi for nearly a year,because of pressure from his militant constituency.   These failings have disappointed those who expected Mr.Mandela to walk out of prison, soar above factional strifeand immediately unify this divided country. These people,particularly white South Africans, criticize him for a lackof vision.   But as the whites have for decades misunderstood the needsand motives of their black countrymen, they have alsomisjudged Mr. Mandela. If he had detached himself from hisANC constituency to play a mediating role, he would, by now,be politically impotent and his moderating influence over hishard-line colleagues largely irrelevant. As for vision, Mr.Mandela's is the same as it was when he was sentenced to lifeimprisonment in 1964: a South Africa free of racialdiscrimination and white-minority domination.   &quot;Let the people themselves decide who is going torepresent them in government,&quot; he says slowly and forcefully,lingering on each word to make sure that this basicdemocratic principle sinks in.   So single-minded is Mr. Mandela's vision that when he isasked what has most astonished him from all he has seen sincehis release, he speaks not about cordless telephones, laptopcomputers or towering skyscrapers, but about the world-wideopposition to apartheid.   &quot;There have been fantastic developments which are quiteimpressive,&quot; he says. &quot;The attitude of the internationalcommunity has been very encouraging, where you find black andwhite, capitalist and socialist countries who are takingexactly the same position in regard to the question of theremoval {of apartheid}.&quot;   Despite his impatience to make a final push againstapartheid, the private Mr. Mandela can best be described asserene, a quality fashioned during his long imprisonment.Harry Oppenheimer, South Africa's mining magnate, recallsreceiving Mr. Mandela in his office in the early 1950s andbeing addressed by &quot;a powerful fellow with quite a loud voice. . . as if I was at a public meeting.&quot; Today, Mr. Mandelaspeaks in quiet, measured sentences, confident of thecorrectness of his words and ideas. As a former lawyer, heprefers to work out South Africa's problems over anegotiating table.   But in public he is still capable of a revolutionaryflourish. While the government sees as contradictory theANC's two-track strategy, negotiations backed up by &quot;massaction&quot; such as strikes and demonstrations, Mr. Mandelaargues that it is a complementary, and necessary, 1-2 punch.   &quot;There are only two ways of reaching the same vision aboutthe future of the country. First is that of discussion andpersuasion, which we are doing. The second is that of usingthe power of the people,&quot; Mr. Mandela says. &quot;If we can'tconvince {the government} through argument and persuasion,then of course we must use the power of the people. And thatis where mass action comes in. People are entitled to go intothe streets if the method of argument and persuasion doesn'tbring about concrete results.&quot;   Mr. Mandela worries that the legacies of apartheid -- thehate, the intolerance, the culture of violence -- arebecoming more entrenched each day the new South Africa failsto dawn.   &quot;I have at numerous rallies raised this pointspecifically: that the right of people to differ from us mustbe preserved,&quot; he says. &quot;We are attacking the government forthe fact that they are showing this political intolerance. Wemustn't be accused of the same thing.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
