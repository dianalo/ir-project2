Domingos and thousands like him are maimed reminders of a civilwar neither side is able to win. The conflict has gripped Angolasince independence from Portugal in 1975, causing stagnation anddesolation in one of Africa's most richly endowed nations.   Several months after Domingos stepped on the mine, he hobbled upa ramp at the Kuito-Bie Rehabilitation Center with a rubber-tippedmetal rod in place of his lower left leg, undergoing physicaltherapy to prepare for the artificial limb he will wear the rest ofhis life.   His doctors say the mine was planted by the National Union forthe Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA. The U.S.-supportedrebels are fighting a war of attrition against the Marxistgovernment of the Angolan Popular Liberation Movement, known by itsPortuguese initials MPLA.   South Africa says it halted 13 years of aid to UNITA aftersigning a U.S.-mediated accord Dec. 22 with Angola and Cuba onwithdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola and independence forSouth-West Africa, also known as Namibia, which South Africa hascontrolled since World War I.   All South African troops in southern Angola moved back across theborder to Namibia when a truce between the two nations began Aug. 8.   Dr. Sabino Salongue, director of the rehabilitation center inAngola's fertile central highlands, said most of amputees beingtreated were victims of mines planted by UNITA. Others lost limbswhen gangrene set in because rifle wounds were poorly tended, hesaid.   Visitors to UNITA headquarters at Jamba, in southeastern Angolanear Namibia, see amputees of the other side who stepped on minesplanted by the Cuban-supported army to impede rebel advances.   Many victims of the war are Ovimbundu, the people of centralHuambo and Bie provinces who in 1960 were 38 percent of the 5million living in a colony 14 times the size of Portugal.   UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, 54, is an Ovimbundu. His fatherworked for the Caminho de Ferro de Benguela, the railway on whichagricultural products and ores from Zambia and Zaire once rolled tothe Atlantic ports of Benguela and Lobito.   Today, the Cunje railway station four miles outside Kuito is amass of broken bricks and shards of blue-and-white Portuguese tiles,target of a UNITA attack.   Grass and wildflowers grow between the rails. Five huge steamlocomotives built by Bayer, Peacock and Co. Ltd. of Manchester,England, rust on sidings with no place to go since UNITA blew up thebridges between Huambo and Kuito.   Armando Ferreira, 54 years a railroader, still shows up at theyard each day. He said people on both sides are weary of war andeager for the railway to run again so their corn, bananas and milletcan go to market and they can receive goods from the outside.   An international conference is scheduled for Jan. 25-26 inLuanda, capital of Angola, to raise funds for a 10-year developmentplan in the Lobito corridor, including reconstruction of theBenguela railway. The conference is sponsored by the Southern AfricaDevelopment Coodination Conference and the European EconomicCommission.   The cost of re-opening the railroad has been estimated at$300-$600 million.   Kieran J. O'Cuneen, the Economic Commission representative inAngola, fears potential donor nations may balk at committingsubstantial funds because the war has made it impossible to conducta technical study in the region.   He and others involved in development projects feel withdrawal ofCuban troops, which began Jan. 10 and is to be finished by mid-1991,could lead to more economic aid and development if the civil waralso ends.   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos says Angola will not negotiatewith UNITA and seeks diplomatic relations with the United States.His government has declared a year-long amnesty to begin Feb. 4,which spokesman Paulinho Pinto Joao says will be open to allrenounce violence and accept the constitution.   President-elect George Bush has written Savimbi, however,promising continued U.S. support until the government does negotiatewith UNITA.   Covert U.S. military aid to the rebels was blocked for a decadeby a 1975 congressional amendment, but resumed in 1986 and is saidto total about $15 million annually.   A Western diplomat said Washington's policy toward UNITA was``outdated'' and the Marxism espoused by the ruling ruling party was``only skin deep.''   ``You'll see; this is not a Marxist nation,'' he said. ``Nearlyall their trade is with the West. When the Cubans have left, thenthey'll get rid of the Russians.''</TEXT></DOC>
