<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-21-0892 </DOCNO><TEXT>The paper describes a numerical simulation method, which enables the determinationof the transient states in mine ventilation network caused by open fires.The simulation method is based on a set of finite difference equations,corresponding with differential equations, which constitute the mathematicalmodel of the following phenomena: generation of heat due to the fire;heat exchange between the fire, air and rocks; non-steady flow of airand fumes in mine ventilation network. Initial, boundary conditions andthe mathematical model determine the solution obtained by the methodin form of functions of time, which express the temperature of air androcks and the transient of flow in all branches of the network. Examplesof simulations are given. 10 refs., 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
