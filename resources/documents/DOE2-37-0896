Demands from commercial and industrial fields are increasing lately.Approximately 60% of the raw material for city gas in Japan is LNG, andabout 80% of the raw material used by gas industry in Tokyo, Osaka andNagoya is LNG. Out of the application technologies for natural gas, someof the main ones are introduced which are recently put to practical useand expected to become popular. Optimum type energies will be selectedby comsumers, and the types of energies to be used are expected to bediversified. Gas industry, therefore, places the application technologyfor natural gas as the most important subject to be studied. In the areaof new burners, there are gas infrared heaters, pulse combustion burners,and ceramic burners. Brief explanation is made for the gas air conditioningsystem, gas engine heat pump, local airconditioning system, cogenerationsystem, fuel cells, natural gas motorcars, and technology for LNG thermalapplication.
