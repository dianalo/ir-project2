LeBow consolidates his control of the company.    Since Mr. LeBow gained control of Western Union in January for $25 million, the nine officers have either resigned or been fired, according to the company's latest proxy statement and to Robert J. Amman, Mr. LeBow's appointee as president and chief executive. Under Mr. LeBow, who is chairman, Western Union is selling its telecommunications network and expanding in less capital-intensive communications and financial services markets.    &quot;To implement our program, it made sense for a number of people to leave,&quot; Mr. Amman said in an interview yesterday. &quot;In some cases, the discussion was initiated by management and in some cases by the individual. In no case did we lose somebody we really wanted to keep.&quot;    As previously reported, the former chairman and chief executive officer, Robert S. Leventhal, resigned in January. According to the proxy statement, he has agreed to act as a consultant for five years at $400,000 a year, plus options to buy 660,000 shares.    Richard C. Hostetler, an executive vice president, and John W. R. Pope Jr., president and chief operating officer, also resigned in January, according to the proxy statement. Under their employment agreements, Messrs. Hostetler and Pope will receive $225,000 a year through 1992 and options to buy 275,000 shares, exercisable for $2.23 a share, the proxy statement said.    Western Union closed at $2.625, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    In addition to those officers, Mr. Amman said Bernard Weitzer, formerly senior vice president, and vice presidents Janet L. Boudris, Francis P. Cleary, Eugene P. Foley, Martin V. McCarthy and Max A. Slifer Jr. also have left, the last departing in March.    At the company's annual meeting next Thursday, Western Union will ask shareholders to vote on a slate of six directors, none of whom was a director prior to Mr. LeBow's involvement. The LeBow group also excluded the leader of a proxy fight, Marcello Valenzano, who was invited on the board last December in return for dropping lawsuits against the company.    Close observers of Upper Saddle River, N.J.-based Western Union had predicted Mr. Valenzano's ouster from the time of his appointment. Mr. Amman said the company would seek another new, outside director &quot;with more business experience&quot; than Mr. Valenzano.    The proxy statement also indicates that $10 million of Mr. LeBow's $25 million Western Union investment was initially borrowed from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. The remaining $15 million came from a LeBow entity, L Holdings Inc., which advanced money to Brooke Partners L.P., the limited partnership through which Mr. LeBow and certain Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. employees control Western Union, said Edward J. Bailey, a director nominee and chief financial officer of LeBow Industries Inc.    Loans to Brooke Partners, Mr. Bailey said, were repaid when Brooke raised, through Drexel, $300 million in high yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds last spring. The Western Union investment effectively represents the first investment by the Brooke junk bond fund, he said.    The proxy statement also said that ITT Corp. owns 6.6 million Western Union common shares, or 16.8% of the 39 million shares outstanding, as a result of the sale of its international telex business to Western Union for $131 million plus assumption of $34 million in debt.    First Executive Corp., Los Angeles, a Drexel bond client, and Pacific Asset Holdings L.P., an investment group headed by a former Drexel executive, also own smaller percentages of Western Union, mostly through convertible preferred issues and warrants to buy stock, according to the proxy statement.    Investment Limited Partnership, a partnership controlled by Richard E. Rainwater, former adviser to the Texas Bass brothers, holds 5.8%, or 526,315 shares, of Western Union's Class B preferred shares, the proxy statement said.    Additionally, auditors for Western Union qualified the company's 1987 financial statements, saying if LeBow management can't sell off assets and reduce operating costs, the company won't be able to fund capital needs and preferred dividends and could fail to meet certain covenants of its recent $500 million junk bond offering. Proceeds from the offering were used to buy the ITT business, for working capital, repayment of bank debt and restructuring costs, according to the annual 10-K report. </TEXT></DOC>
