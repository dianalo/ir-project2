Sen. Bob Dole was born here, and he chose thistown to announce his 1988 presidential bid because he thoughtit typified traditional values and common sense.   It is an unlikely place for a tale of UFOs,extraterrestrials, the Second Coming and mysteriousdisappearances. But that's what unfolded here over the pastmonth, when four women vanished, leaving behind bewilderedfamilies and friends.</LP><TEXT>   The task of finding them fell to county Sheriff RobertBalloun (pronounced like balloon), a small-town peace officerwhose manhunts are more often cow-hunts. &quot;I keep a book oflocal brands, so I can tell who lost cows belong to,&quot; hesays. And while the 63-year-old former oil-truck drivereventually located the missing women, the fallout from theaffair will probably linger in this agricultural andoil-drilling town for a long time.   It all began in 1989, when a Russell housewife and motherof five, Donna R. Butts, published a book called &quot;UFO: TheFour&quot; (later published in paperback as &quot;Earth, the FinalChapter&quot;). She wrote that the Second Coming was imminent andwould take place in Russell. How did she know? Because, shewrote, extraterrestrials, who she said were angels, had cometo earth in spaceships to tell her.   She said she spotted the first in a grocery store parkinglot in a Rolls-Royce with California tags. &quot;He was what mostwomen would call gorgeous -- aquiline features, sky-blueeyes, silver-blond hair and a body any man would be proud tohave,&quot; she wrote.   Mrs. Butts said she met frequently with herextraterrestrial friend, named Peter. She also met Amorcans(good guys), Neekies (their helpers) and Creasions (evilones). Some drove cars, others spaceships. Their mission: tohelp Mrs. Butts prepare the world for Armageddon. Theyinstructed her in the use of crystal as a spiritual tool(effective only when attached to a copper chain) and in thesigns to watch for, including an increase in deaths byspontaneous combustion.   After the book was published, by a UFO press in Tucson,Ariz., a small group of about two dozen believers sprang up,including two well-respected high school teachers, MarciaBrock and Gertrude Furney. The group believed that the SecondComing would take place as soon as Sen. Dole was electedpresident and moved the White House here.   This is all not quite as unusual as it seems. There's beena small surge in groups claiming to communicate withspiritually guided extraterrestrials. Gordon Melton, whostudies alternative faiths at the University of California,Santa Barbara, knows of as many as 20, including one inFlorida that claims 1,500 members. For the most part, Prof.Melton says, the founders of these groups arecollege-educated people who lead otherwise unremarkablelives.   Except for the college-educated part, that certainly fitsMrs. Butts, a 39-year-old farmer's daughter whom people heredescribe as pleasant, painfully shy and not particularlyreligious. Most people in town say they paid Mrs. Butts nomind. But when she predicted two years ago that a UFO wouldappear outside of town, &quot;the gravel roads out there were ascongested as a major freeway, although nobody in Russell willprobably admit it,&quot; says Gary Christie, a local artist. Thatnight, some viewers did profess to see a UFO. But that wasn'treally so unusual: People in Russell seemed to see UFOsfairly regularly.   All of this was something of a small joke around Russellfor a long time. But it became something more after Sept. 9.On that day, Mrs. Brock attended the funeral of Mrs. Furney,a retired art teacher who had been recruited to the groupafter Mrs. Butts viewed her sculpture of &quot;The SeventhTrumpeter,&quot; an angel in the New Testament Book of Revelationswho trumpets Armageddon.   Right after the funeral, Mrs. Brock vanished, along withher two college-aged daughters. And eight days later, Mrs.Butts disappeared, too.   No one could imagine Mrs. Brock, a past president of thelocal Kansas National Education Association chapter andschool newspaper adviser, abandoning her classes without aword. &quot;She was always cheerful, always responsible, and neverstrange at all,&quot; says Allan D. Evans, publisher of theRussell Daily News. And Wayne Butts couldn't envision hiswife, alone in their house at the time of her disappearance,willingly leaving her children. In a letter to the newspaper,he cited evidence of a struggle: &quot;The shotgun was on thefloor on top of the clothes basket like it had been knockedout of her hands.&quot;   Sheriff Balloun entered the case. He thought the struggleat the Butts home looked &quot;concocted&quot; and suspected thedisappearances were rigged, but had to investigate anyway. &quot;Ihad to prove to myself the women were safe,&quot; he says.   Among his first discoveries: There were so many UFOsaround Russell because some mischievous locals had beenattaching road flares and blinking lights to weather balloonsand helium-filled trash bags and releasing them on dark,windy nights. &quot;The day after we let one of those littlethings go, some guy was quoted in the paper saying he saw aUFO the night before that was 300 feet long with lights allaround it,&quot; says Cecil Mashburn, a retired air trafficcontroller who insists he hasn't launched a fake UFO inyears. Still, he concedes he started a trend among the localpranksters.   With no trail to follow, Sheriff Balloun chased dozens oftips. &quot;Somebody reported seeing the women sitting atop a hilloutside town, and we had other reports that they were hidingin caves,&quot; he says. So, for days on end, Sheriff Ballounsearched the countryside late into the night.   Many in the town, however, took the case less seriously.Street signs went up proclaiming, &quot;No Parking. Reserved ForUFOs.&quot; The Stop 2 Shop convenience store began advertising&quot;Free Mars Bar With UFO Fill Up.&quot; And meatpacker Randy Dietzsold about 150 T-shirts (at $12.50 each), urging, &quot;Just SayNo to UFOs.&quot;   The group followers, who generally are respected residentsof Russell, kept a very low profile. &quot;I can't walk into astore in Russell these days without someone doing that`Twilight Zone' music,&quot; says Mr. Christie, the local artist,who was believed to be a follower because of his friendshipwith one of its members (he denies it).   Meanwhile, the local library was besieged with requestsfor Mrs. Butts's book. Students at Bickerdyke ElementarySchool, located across the street from the Seventh Trumpetersculpture, swore they saw the angel's trumpet move. &quot;They'dheard talk, and it made them anxious,&quot; says psychologistKenneth Krannawitter, who was summoned to console them. Overcoffee at the Boot Hill Cafe, &quot;the guys are asking, `Whathave we become -- California?'&quot; says Mr. Mashburn, theretired air traffic controller.   As are many mysteries, the disappearances were solvedroutinely enough, and by accident, on Sept. 26. UnitedAirlines called one of the Brock girls to confirm theirWashington, D.C.-to-Israel reservations. An alert roommate,aware of the hubbub in Russell, relayed the flightinformation to Sheriff Balloun, who arranged for the FBI tomeet the four women. &quot;They told the FBI that they had leftRussell of their own accord, and they were going to Israelfor a religious thing,&quot; says the sheriff. Since they hadn'tcommitted a crime, he says, the FBI couldn't interrogate themfurther, although agents noted the women had open-endedreturn tickets.   With concerns about their safety allayed, sympathy for thewomen is running low in Russell. Local critics wonder whythey didn't tell their families about the trip. Schoolofficials say they doubt Mrs. Brock will get her job back.   A couple of loyal group followers, demanding anonymity,insist the missing women disappeared without notice becausethat's the order they'd received from an extraterrestrial.Shaking his head, Sheriff Balloun says, &quot;I don't know what itwill take to knock these beliefs out of the heads of somepeople. But as far as I'm concerned, the case is closed.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
