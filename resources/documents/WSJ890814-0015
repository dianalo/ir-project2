The retreat, confirmed yesterday by lead Magnet underwriter Bankers Trust Co., caps a series of troubled buy-outs in British retailing. Rising interest rates have hit retail sales here, unsettling potential investors. &quot;Market conditions aren't right for this sector,&quot; a Bankers Trust spokesman said, explaining the decision to withdraw the Magnet debt-syndication plan. When conditions improve, he added, the plan will be revived.    The decision leaves New York-based Bankers Trust and its eight underwriting partners holding far more Magnet debt than they had planned. The underwriters have already provided Magnet's management with #562.5 million to complete its highly leveraged, #629 million buy-out of the home-improvement chain. To reduce their own exposure, the underwriters had planned on marketing half that high-yielding debt in a syndicated offering.    The snag highlights the growing pains of Europe's leveraged buy-out business. In such a transaction, an investor group finances its purchase of a company with heavy borrowings, often paid by selling company assets afterward. Recently, buyout attempts have multiplied in Britain. The biggest, unveiled last month, is a #13.35 billion leveraged bid for conglomerate B.A.T Industries PLC by financier Sir James Goldsmith and colleagues. Bankers Trust, which also advises Sir James's group, denied the Magnet problem would affect the B.A.T or other buy-out attempts. Instead, the Bankers Trust spokesman said, the Magnet snag reflects problems unique to Britain's slowing retail sector.    For instance, on Friday U.K. retailer Ward White PLC said it failed to organize its own leveraged buy-out. The company, under attack from a #900 million bid by Britain's Boots Co., had been hunting financing for a higher counterbid. But, Ward White said, &quot;in the current state of the debt markets it isn't possible to create leveraged proposals.&quot; Earlier this month, British furniture chain MFI Group said deteriorating sales are forcing it to refinance some debt left over from its own 1987 management buy-out.    With high interest rates cooling Britain's former retailing boom, &quot;everyone's being much more cautious&quot; about buying risky, high-yielding debt securities in U.K. shopkeepers, said analyst Joan D'Olier of London-based County NatWest Securities Ltd. She added that the Magnet underwriters may have to wait until at least next year for the British retail market to recover sufficiently for a relaunched Magnet debt offering. </TEXT></DOC>
