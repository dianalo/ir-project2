It wasn't only Georgia'sFranklin Langham, the third-round leader, who had the &quot;distinct advantage&quot; ofplaying under ideal morning conditions.;    While Langham stumbled to a 75 fora 1-under-par 287, Nevada Las-Vegas sophomore Warren Schutte blazed home witha 5-under 67 for a 283 to capture the individual title. Georgia Tech's DavidDuval was second at 286.;    Mickelson, who had said he was &quot;grinding&quot; allweek, finally ground himself down on the front nine. He missed three puttsunder three feet in that stretch. His back nine included one more short puttmissed as he posted a 75 to finish tied for fourth at 289.;    Realizing hewas five shots behind Schutte at the turn, Mickelson could only switch hisemphasis to helping ASU in the team race. No help there, either. The defendingchampion Sun Devils came in third, scoring 1,175 to wind up 14 strokes behindwinner Oklahoma State and seven behind North Carolina.;    Stanford, withfreshman Casey Martin firing a 69, had its best day of the 72-hole event. Ittotaled 1,200, tying for 15th.;    Schutte (pronounced SKOO-tah) helped theRebels finish eighth. A native of Durban, South Africa, he is believed to bethe first foreign player to win the NCAA title.;    &quot;This is tremendous,&quot; saidSchutte after winning his fourth straight tournament. &quot;It's incredible. I'm sohappy. It was so nerve-racking to have to wait for the result. But it wasworth it.&quot;;    Because he was grouped with his team, which was 25 strokes offthe lead after 54 holes, Schutte teed off almost five hours before ASUcontenders Mickelson and Jim Lemon. Playing the back nine first, Schutteshredded the par-5s, going 6 under par on them.;    Most of the early focuswas on Langham, but Schutte -- who began the day four strokes behind -- keptpounding away. He birdied his 17th hole (No. 8) to get to 3 under for thetournament and then scored a dramatic eagle on the par-5 No. 9.;    Schuttelaced a 4-wood second shot 260 yards to the fringe of the green, only 18 feetfrom the cup. Mickelson, practicing on the putting green 40 yards away,sneaked a peek at Schutte's lie and then turned away. When Schutte dropped theputt, the crowd cheered.;    &quot;I heard the roar -- I knew he had made it and Iknew what I had to do,&quot; Mickelson said. &quot;It was just too bad the nationalchampionship was decided by a target score. I wish we could have playedhead-to-head type golf.&quot;;    When Schutte sank his climactic putt, he kneltoff the green, bowed his head and cried.;    &quot;When I finished birdie-eagle, itgot to me emotionally,&quot; he said.;   LEADER BOARD; Schutte, UNLV         283;Duval, Georgia Tech   286; Langham, Georgia      287; ...; Team scores;Oklahoma State   1161; North Carolina   1168; Arizona State    1175; WakeForest      1180; Brigham Young    1185; 15, Stanford     1200  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAN HRUBY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910609  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  578  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday June 9, 199100161236,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
