The executives of Commodore Savings Association, E. MortenHopkins and John Harrell were given five-year sentences by U.S.District Judge Joe Fish, who suspended all but six months of thesentences.   Commodore's former owner, Robert H. Hopkins Jr., was sentencedWednesday to 15 years in prison for creating the donation scheme,which began in 1982.   A jury in May convicted the Hopkins brothers on 47 countsincluding conspiracy, making false entries into the records of abank, misappropriation of funds and making false statements to afederal agency.   Harrell, former Commodore chief executive, was convicted on twocounts of making false entries into the records of a bank, butacquitted on the other charges.   Fish also ordered all three men to pay restitution to the FederalSavings and Loan Insurance Corp. for money diverted from the thrift.The FSLIC will recover $104,062 from the judgment, with Harrell topay about $4,000 and the Hopkins brothers to pay the balance.   Federal law prohibits corporate contributions to politicalcampaigns.   During the trial, thrift employees testified they gave money topolitical action committees and were reimbursed through payincreases or checks for fictional travel.   Prosecutors alleged the defendants tried to hide contributions tomembers of Congress, including Rep. Jim Wright, D-Texas, who wasthen embroiled in an ethics investigation that led to hisresignation.   Prosecutors said there was no evidence that recipients of thecontributions knew of the scheme.   Attorney Carol Vance, who represented the defendants, did notreturn a phone call from The Associated Press.   Prosecutor David Jarvis said the case was the first involvingillegal political contributions to be tried at the felony level. Thecharge is a misdemeanor, but was upgraded because the defendantswere accused of making false statements to a federal agency andentering false information in bank records.</TEXT></DOC>
