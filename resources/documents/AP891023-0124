The National Resettlement Coordinator and members of a U.S.churchworkers' delegation called on the rightist administration ofPresident Alfredo Cristiani to remove all obstacles to therefugees' return.   The government says it has nothing against the refugees' returnbut that they must be documented in Honduras by Salvadoranofficials before coming back. The Resettlement Coordinator accusedthe government ``of prolonging the documentation process'' to delaythe refugees' return.   About 13,000 Salvadorans live in three refugee camps across thenorthern border in Honduras. Most fled to the camps in the early1980s because of heavy fighting between leftist rebels andgovernment forces in the northern sector of El Salvador.   More than 7,000 refugees have returned since 1987 to rebuildtheir lives in the north, still a combat zone in the 10-year-oldcivil war. The U.S.-backed government considers the returnedrefugees sympathizers and collaborators of the Farabundo MartiNational Liberation Front, the rebel army.   About 1,300 refugees from the Mesa Grande camp had planned toreturn Oct. 17. The return was to have been coordinated by the U.N.High Commission for Refugees.   Col. Carlos Figueroa said Saturday the documentation has begunin Mesa Grande and that as soon as it is finished, the refugeeswill be allowed to return.   The U.N. commission said it cannot provide transportation andother logistics for return without government approval.   The Resettlement Coordinator's allegation of government delayswas seconded by a delegation of 30 American churchpeople whotraveled to Honduras and El Salvador this month to accompany thereturnees.   The Rev. Marilyn Chilcote, a Presbyterian pastor from Oakland,Calif., said three people have died in Mesa Grande from exposuresince the refugees dismantled their shacks last week inanticipation of departure. She also said an epidemic of Denguefever has afflicted many refugees.   About 300 refugees accompanied by Salvadoran and U.S.churchworkers left Mesa Grande by foot last week for the border.They reached San Marcos Ocotepeque, where they remain in precariousconditions in a church awaiting documentation, the refugeeadvocates said.</TEXT></DOC>
