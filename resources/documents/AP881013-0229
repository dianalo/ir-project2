Judge Rafael Pena signed the warrants at the request of theattorney general's office, said the assistant, Jorge Lozano.   Carlos Lazo of the Attorney General's Human Rights Departmentsaid the judge had been asked to issue the warrants for foursoldiers of the Jiboa Battalion alleged to have been involved inthe Sept. 21 massacre.   According to residents of San Francisco, 30 miles east of SanSalvador, battalion soliders used grenades and gunfire to killseven men and three women from the village who were suspected ofcollaborating with leftist guerrillas.   The army at first said the 10 dead were part of a guerrillacolumn ambushed by troops. After testimony of relatives andneighbors became public, the military changed its version to sayeight peasants were killed in an ambush by guerrillas and troopskilled two of the ambushers.   Lazo said that according to villagers, up to eight soldiers wereinvolved in the slayings. While more arrest warrants could berequested, Lazo said no officer had been implicated to date.   ``We have asked the judge to order the arrest of four people,all soldiers in the Jiboa Battalion,'' Lazo said. ``Sufficientevidence exists to justify their detention _ the testimony of therelatives, the neighbors.''   The Jiboa Battalion is part of the 5th Infantry Brigade based innearby San Vicente. Brigade commander Col. Jesus Chavez Caceres onThursday sent Pena a list of soldiers who Chavez said wereoperating in San Francisco on Sept. 21.   Chavez's list, which Lozano showed reporters in the judge'soffice in San Sebastian, had the names of 33 men. Only one of thefour names appearing on the arrest warrants _ Hernan Ayala _ was onthe list, which did not identify the soldiers' ranks. San Sebastianis 21 miles east of San Salvador.   Lozano said Pena would ask Chavez for an expanded list toinclude ranks. He said the arrest warrants would be delivered toChavez.   Attempts to contact Chavez at 5th Brigade headquarters wereunsuccessful.   In comments broadcast Wednesday by local television, Chavezinsisted the peasants died in a guerrilla ambush.   Nine of the 10 bodies were exhumed last week. Roberto Maldonado,a court-appointed forensic doctor, told journalists seven of thenine bodies had powder burns indicating they had been shot from adistance of about six inches.   The slayings represented the first massacre of such magnitudeattributed to government forces in four years. Human rights groupsalso have expressed concern over a rise in killings by right-wingdeath squads.   A recent report by Americas Watch, a New York-based privateorganization that monitors human rights, noted two weeks ago thatno Salvadoran officer or death squad member has been prosecuted andpunished for a human rights violation.   The U.S. State Department, through the embassy, has putconsiderable pressure on government and military authorities toinvestigate the slayings and prosecute those responsible,diplomatic sources say.   The 9-year civil war pitting leftist guerrillas againstgovernment forces has killed an estimated 65,000 people, most ofthem civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
