Robert Dole.    The departure of the 51-year-old Mrs. Dole, the only woman currently in the cabinet, has been expected because her husband's strategists feel that her full-time work would be a major asset to the campaign.    She leaves amid criticism that although she has recently taken steps aimed at improving airline service, she hasn't moved aggressively enough to cope with a legion of service and safety problems that have occurred in the wake of deregulation.    Rep. Bud Shuster (R., Pa.), a member of the House Aviation Subcommittee, characterized Mrs. Dole's recent actions, which include requiring airlines to disclose their on-time performance, as &quot;too little, too late&quot; and a direct result of congressional pressure. Rep. Norman Mineta, (D., Calif.), chairman of the panel, said that she knew &quot;very little about aviation.&quot;    But Mrs. Dole, in an interview, asserted that she had accumulated a &quot;very strong record&quot; on aviation and other issues. During her tenure, she said, the department has added air traffic controllers and airline safety inspectors, and the accident rate has declined.    On the subject of highways, Mrs. Dole, who has dubbed herself &quot;the safety secretary,&quot; pointed with special pride to her passive restraint rule, which, she said, is &quot;saving lives now&quot; by requiring that 25% of 1988 model year cars be equipped with automatic seat belts or air bags. The rule also has been instrumental in encouraging the passage of mandatory seat belt use laws, which are now in place in 29 states and the District of Columbia.    Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.), ranking minority member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and a frequent critic of what he calls &quot;foot-dragging&quot; by the department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, yesterday praised Mrs. Dole for doing &quot;an excellent job in the context of an administration that has been difficult to persuade on a number of transportation safety issues.&quot;    Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.), ranking minority member of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee, said Mrs. Dole has been an innovator in air traffic control procedures and &quot;leaves a legacy of safety.&quot;    Several names have been mentioned as possible successors to Mrs. Dole. They include: Patricia Goldman, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board; Ann Dore McLaughlin, former undersecretary of the Interior Department; Wendy Gramm, administrator of the Office of Management and Budget's regulatory affairs office; James Broyhill, former North Carolina congressman; and Mack Mattingly, a former Georgia senator.    White House officials acknowledged that those names were being discussed but said they hadn't drawn up a formal list of candidates to give to President Reagan yet.    Rumors about Mrs. Dole's departure have been circulating in the capital for months. But she insisted yesterday that she hadn't come to a final decision until last weekend, after her husband's political strategists urged her to do a 12-state swing through the South and to set up a campaign office in Charlotte, N.C., to spearhead the campaign for the &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; collection of primaries in March. Mrs. Dole is a native of North Carolina.    &quot;There's no way I can put DOT first and get all that done,&quot; she told reporters at the White House after meeting briefly with President Reagan to inform him of her decision.    On the campaign trail, the Doles constitute an appealing, politically powerful team that is unique in American politics. Mrs. Dole tends to soften her husband's intense, sometimes angry, image. And aides to the Kansas GOP senator said Mrs. Dole will provide much-needed access to the South, where he has a special problem in name recognition. On a recent trip to Columbia, S.C., Mrs. Dole extolled her husband's virtues to a barnful of Republicans, describing in detail his battles to overcome wounds suffered in World War II and his struggle to tame the federal deficit. Sen. Dole is expected to formally announce his candidacy later this year.    But in Washington, Mrs. Dole, whose 4 1/2-year tenure is the longest of any transportation secretary, increasingly has been confronted with questions about her own department's performance in the face of alarming reports of near mid-air collisions and controller errors.    Moreover, the department's approval of 19 major mergers and acquisitions, which some analysts said have caused a deterioration in service and may lead to higher fares, has caused some concern even among some of the architects of deregulation.    In addition, Mrs. Dole was faulted by some for spending what she described as the equivalent of nine workdays last month campaigning for her husband. That drew an angry response from her aides, who said she shouldn't be criticized for doing some work for her husband, while Vice President George Bush, the GOP front-runner, isn't under any pressure to relinquish his post as he pursues the presidency. And they said that, despite her busy travel schedule, Mrs. Dole managed to win commitments from airlines in recent weeks to reduce flight delays.    Nevertheless, persistent concerns about publicity on bad airline service may have affected the timing of Mrs. Dole's decision, which was somewhat earlier than expected. Because of airline problems, said political analyst Kevin Phillips, &quot;the department was turning into a no-win situation.&quot;    Mrs. Dole has gotten kudos for two accomplishments that eluded her predecessors: the transfer of control of Washington National and Washington's Dulles airports to a regional commission and the public stock sale of the government's 85% stake in Consolidated Rail Corp., though she initially wanted to sell it to Norfolk Southern Corp.    She also instituted random drug testing for department employees involved in safety-related jobs. But critics have said the department has been sluggish in issuing a new rule to improve passenger protection in side-impact auto accidents.    ---   Gerald F.
