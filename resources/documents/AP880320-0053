The army's chief of staff, St. Gen. Dan Shomron, said theshooting could augur greater use of guns by Palestinian activists.He stopped short of saying it signaled a major change in thetactics of protesters, who have mainly hurled stones and bottles atIsrael's occupation forces.   ``I don't think we can yet see this as a shift to an armedstruggle,'' he said.   But Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin indicated stronger actionwould be taken to quell Palestinian uprisings.   ``To the extent that extremist Palestinian terrorist elementstry to combine terrorist acts with the civilian disturbances, wewill have to adjust our operations and take harsher measures tocope with both,'' he said.   The army identified the slain soldier as Sgt. Moshe Katz, 28,from the northern port city of Haifa.   He was shot two or three times in the head at close range whileguarding a government building facing the small Beit JibrinPalestinian refugee camp in this biblical city, the military said.   Troops immediately sealed off the road, the main tourist routefrom Jerusalem to the city's Manger Square, the site of Christ'sbirth. They also slapped a curfew on the refugee camp and ``roundedup everyone who was in the area'' for questioning, an armyspokesman said.   Shortly after the killing, a dozen Israeli soldiers guardedabout 100 Palestinians in front of shops. Soldiers led them away insmall groups for questioning.   Rabin and Shomron rushed to the scene.   ``It's a painful day, but we are determined to go on to makesure security will prevail in Israel and the territories,'' Rabinsaid later at the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City, the mostsacred site in Judaism.   He told a group of supporters that the protests in the occupiedterritories had the same goal as the Arab wars against Israel:``The purpose is through the use of force to get rid of us.''   Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij said the situation in theterritories ``will be aggravated'' by the shooting. But he blamedthe frustration of Arab protesters on Israel's occupation of landscaptured in the 1967 Middle East war.   ``The key to calming down the situation is in the hands of the(Israeli) minister of defense and the government,'' he said.   Freij said that the army had used welding torches during the twoprevious days to seal 20 shops that were following hours mandatedby the Palestine Liberation Organization. He said souvenir shops onManger Square had been shuttered for six days because ofconflicting army and PLO demands.   In Gaza City, troops closed the main vegetable market for threehours after firing tear gas to disperse Arab youths who blocked amain street and hurled stones at troops, Arab reporters said.   Israelis have been using economic pressure in addition tomilitary force in trying to quell the unrest. They have cutinternational telephone lines and blocked fuel shipments.   PLO chief Yasser Arafat has said throughout the unrest that heordered his followers to forgo use of guns against Israeli forces.The army has reported only scattered cases of Arabs shooting atsoldiers or civilians.   Last Thursday, an Israeli civilian was shot in the legs near arefugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip.   Israeli troops have killed 103 Palestinians since Dec. 8,according to United Nations figures.   The Arab-run Palestine Press Service said two more Palestiniansdied Sunday of wounds suffered in earlier clashes with soldiers,but these were not confirmed by the army.   Katz's killing took place a day before what underground leaderswere billing as potentially the most severe confrontations yet. Arecent communique circulated in the Gaza Strip and West Bank calledfor major protests Monday. They were aimed at marking the 1968battle of Karameh, when PLO fighters helped repel an Israeli forcethat attacked a guerrilla base in Jordan.   In other West Bank violence, the army said Israeli troops shotand killed a 26-year-old Arab late Saturday when their patrol wasattacked with firebombs in the village of Kfar Dan, about 50 milesnorth of Jerusalem. The Arab-run Palestine Press Service identifiedthe victim as Nameq Milhem.   Israel Radio said the death resulted from new orders calling forsoldiers to shoot at Arabs who throw firebombs.</TEXT></DOC>
