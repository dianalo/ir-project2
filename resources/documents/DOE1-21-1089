They now show that step down heating (SDH) in OvCa cells also rendersthe Arrhenius plot straight over the range of 39-45{sup 0}. OvCa cellsin exponential, monolayer growth were heated from 39-45{sup 0} with orwithout a pre-exposure to 15' @ 45{sup 0} (S.F. = 20%). The Arrheniusplot for single temperature heating was biphasic with an intersectionof the curves at 42.8{sup 0}. The inactivation enthalpy (/d//H) for exposureto temperatures of 43-45{sup 0} was 183 +- 27 kcal/mole, and for exposureto temperatures of 40.5-42.5{sup 0} {Delta}H=435 +- 13 kcal/mole. Bycontrast after SDH, {Delta}H = 157+-6 kcal/mole over the entire rangeof 39-45{sup 0}. These observations lend further evidence that the &quot;break&quot;in the Arrhenius plot at approximately 43{sup 0} is due to the developmentof thermotolerance during exposure to temperatures below 43{sup 0}, andthat the apparent hyperthermia sensitization by SDH is the result ofinhibiting thermotolerance development by prior exposure to temperaturesabove 43{sup 0}.</TEXT></DOC>
