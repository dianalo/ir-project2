His takeover of Kuwait capped a week in which the U.S.Congress has been busily gutting the President's militarybudget. It came after a long string of warnings, includingone from the Journal's Karen Elliott House, that feeding Mr.Hussein cream won't turn him into a pussy cat. Now, someonehas to figure out how to put the pussy cat back in his cage,and that won't be easy.</LP><TEXT>   President Bush responded yesterday by freezing Iraqiassets in the U.S. and launching a trade embargo, policiesJimmy Carter employed with such great effect against Iran atthe outset of the hostage crisis. Iraq probably has someassets in the U.S., but it is doubtful that they are anywhereclose to matching the size of its total external debt;yesterday the Iraqis replied that they'd stop debt repaymentsto the U.S.   Basically, what Saddam Hussein has conducted is a goodold-fashioned caravan raid of the type his ancestors, andmultitudinous other war-makers throughout history, wouldunderstand quite well. Not only is Chief Hussein looting avery rich country, with external assets estimated at $100billion, but he is wiping out his $10 billion debt to theKuwaitis. He used that $10 billion to help buy the arms he isnow employing for liquidating the debt.   What effect the invasion will have on the world-widesupply of oil is a more complex question than it might atfirst seem. London initially marked up crude-oil futures bysome $2 a barrel to over $22. Presumably, Mr. Hussein intendsto sell his stolen oil -- he needs the money -- so supplycurtailment is not a certainty. But there can be no doubtthat he has gained important leverage in the world market.   Some other factors aid his leverage. The Soviet Union'sproducing and distribution infrastructure has been breakingdown because of shoddy construction and poor maintenance andit has had to curtail its exports to such places as Polandand Czechoslovakia. The Soviets yesterday joined theworld-wide chorus of complaint against Mr. Hussein, but theydesperately need foreign exchange, and an oil-price increasewould help offset their lost shipments. It should also beremembered that the Soviets have been his number one armssupplier (the French are second).   Which raises the question of military retaliation againstIraq. Hussein's million-man army is not the Panamanianself-defense force. The U.S. has no ground forces in theregion, in no small part because allies like Kuwait wereunwilling to accept American bases. Our NATO allies haveconsistently insisted that a threat to their Gulf oilsupplies is an &quot;out of area contingency.&quot; The U.S. yesterdayheaded a carrier task force for the Persian Gulf, but forcarriers the Gulf is a constraining puddle. Iraq has somefairly sophisticated attack fighters, with Exocet missiles,and might score a lucky hit.   The U.S. has the means to conduct discriminate raidsagainst Iraqi economic targets, and should be reading this asa possibility. But Mr. Hussein's threats to gas half ofIsrael are probably meant to hold it hostage againstprecisely such raids. The Israelis, lately treated with somedisdain by the American foreign policy establishment, have alot of muscle but indicated yesterday that they will sit ontheir hands unless they themselves are attacked.   Against those limited options we must set the high stakesinvolved. You can bet that Mr. Hussein made some seriouscalculations of his chances for getting by with his theft ofKuwait, and also that those calculations do not stop withKuwait. The way to get real leverage on world oil prices, hewill surely reason, is to steal Saudi Arabia's oil as well.He is militarily capable of doing so, unless the Saudisseriously resist and the West is united in their aid -- bothhighly doubtful.   Mr. Hussein could easily take control of the entire Gulfoil region except Iran, which would give him a real prospectof controlling the world oil price, at least for a time. Hecould levy billions of dollars of taxes on Western oilconsumers. These taxes would beyond doubt be devoted to hismilitary machine, particularly to the development of nuclearweapons and missiles to allow him to threaten and intimidatenot only the Gulf Region but the developed world.   Years of fecklessness have left the West without a goodresponse to Saddam Hussein. Faced with ideological conflict,its leaders have forgotten the ancient threat of piracy, allthe more serious in today's interdependent world. The need tostand up to pirates should come clear as the West finishesrubbing its eyes. Western leaders have a lot of new thinkingto do. We do not know where it ends, but it starts with arecognition that they have huge interests involved.</TEXT></DOC>
