SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CARSON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nissan Motor Corp.'s ads for its newInfiniti models will retain their focus on fuzzy images of nature,such as ponds of pensive trout and gentle cloudbursts, rather thanthe high-performance luxury cars.   ``There are more rocks and pussywillows to come,'' WilliamBruce, Nissan's general manager for the Infiniti line, said at aceremony Wednesday marking the day the Japanese cars officiallywent on sale.   Infiniti has two models, the Q45 full-size four-door sedan, witha base price of $38,000, and the M30 sports coupe at $23,500 _expensive but less costly than European luxury cars.   Nissan officials such as Bruce believe the cars are so good thatthey, along with Toyota Motor Corp.'s new Lexus luxury line, willforce other prestige automakers to offer incentives to buyers orcut prices, as BMW and Jaguar already have done.   But Infiniti's ads have avoided direct shots of the cars.Instead, they soft-focus on falling rain, birds in flight, crashingwaves, hay fields and rock outcroppings, giving just a passingglimpse of the cars.   A meditative text accompanies the moody images. The idea is topique buyers' interest and get them into showrooms.   Enough already, many observers say.   ``What they've clearly been trying to do is develop ananticipation for the vehicle itself, and they're creating a mysteryabout it,'' said Arvid Jouppi, an auto analyst with KeaneSecurities in Chicago.   But he said that now that the car is on sale, ``Sooner or laterthey've got to bring it out in the ads.   ``You may talk to the girl on the phone, but you don't proposeto her that way. Some things you need to do face to face,'' Jouppisaid.   Ronald Glantz, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in SanFrancisco, said anyone prepared to pay for a luxury car will takethe time to compare the Infiniti to the Lexus and other carsregardless of what ads are like.   ``I'm not enough of an (advertising) expert to say whether thisfeel-good advertising will work,'' Glantz said. ``But this is notlike getting Joe Sixpack to stir from his television. The guy whois going to spend $40,000 is going to check it out.''   Lexus, whose models list for $2,000 to $3,000 less thanInfiniti's, was introduced Sept. 1. Through Oct. 31 its dealerssold just under 8,000 cars, about what Lexus predicted.   Infiniti officials have avoided sales projections, however, andthere are just 50 Infiniti dealers in 30 markets in the country.Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia are among the areas withoutdealers.   Bruce said the company had been extremely selective,intentionally starting slowly to ensure quality service andworkmanship. But he predicted Infiniti would have 100 dealerswithin a year and up to 165 in five years.   As for when TV watchers will get more than just a glance of thecars, he said surveys of car buyers and dealers would be thedetermining factor.   ``We'll let the market reaction tell us what to do. Let's watchthe next three or four months and see how the market reacts, andwe'll go from there.''</TEXT></DOC>
