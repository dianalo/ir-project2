<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-64-0020 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has proposed amendmentsto SFAS No. 71 &quot;Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation.&quot;The FASB's position appears to be based on several premises. Utilityassets should earn at the last allowed overall rate of return. If, asa result of action by a regulator (such as a specific cost disallowanceor abandonment) an asset will not earn the overall rate of return, aloss has occurred that should be recorded today. Financial statementsthat recognize asset enhancements but not asset decrements lack representationalfaithfulness. The equity portion of AFUDC is an asset enhancement uniqueto regulated enterprises. As such, the cost of equity must be &quot;uniquely&quot;considered when measuring a loss. All of the Board's proposed provisionsare consistently tied together with these overall positions. The specificissues addressed, the Board's recommendation for each and proposed alternativesare discussed by the author.</TEXT></DOC>
