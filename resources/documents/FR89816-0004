The FDIC is also amending itsregulation to authorize insured banks to display the official sign presentlyprescribed by regulation (``bank sign'') or, in the alternative, to displaythe sign prescribed for insured savings associations by this amendment(``savings association sign''). These actions are necessary in order tocomply with the requirements of section 221 of the Financial InstitutionsReform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (``FIRRE'') of 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Valerie Jean Best, Attorney,Legal Division, (202) 898-3812, FDIC, 550 17th Street, NW., Washington,DC 20429.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>No collections of information pursuant to section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) are contained in this Notice. Consequently,no information has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budgetfor review.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reason for Adoption Without Prior Notice and Comment</ITAG>Immediate adoption of this final rule is necessary to comply with the requirementsof section 221 of FIRRE. The FDIC is required to prescribe regulationsto carry out the purposes of section 221 of FIRRE, including regulationsgoverning the manner of display or use of the bank sign and the savingsassociation sign. Section 221 provides that initial regulations under thatsection shall be prescribed on the date of enactment of FIRRE. This finalrule prescribes the savings association sign. In order to be consistentwith current regulations applicable to banks, and in order to assure depositorsas to the safety of their insured deposits upon the abolishment of theFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, the final rule requiresthat the savings association sign be displayed at each station or windowwhere insured deposits are usually and normally received in a savings association'sprincipal place of business and in all of its branches. Due to the statutorytime constraints, the FDIC finds that application of the notice and publicparticipation provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.553) to this action would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest.The FDIC finds that good cause exists for dispensing with the 30-day delayedeffective date requirement. Since the FDIC has had to move so rapidly toimplement the requirements of FIRRE, the FDIC has established only thoserequirements that are considered to be the minimum necessary to complywith FIRRE. Consequently, additional changes to the FDIC's regulation governingadvertisement of membership are being considered, and comments are invitedthrough an ``Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking'' published elsewherein this issue.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Section 221 of FIRRE amends section 18(a) of the Federal Deposit InsuranceAct (12 U.S.C. 1828(a)). Section 221 requires each insured savings associationto display at each place of business maintained by the association a prescribedsign notifying the public of deposit insurance coverage. More specifically,the prescribed sign must contain only the following items, each of whichis to be accorded substantially equal prominence: a statement that insureddeposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government;a statement that deposits are federally insured to $100,000; and the symbolof an eagle. The sign may not contain any reference to a Government agency.FIRRE provides that, not later than 30 days after the enactment of FIRRE,each insured bank shall display at each place of business maintained bysuch bank a sign notifying the public of deposit insurance coverage. FIRREgives insured banks the option of displaying the official bank sign requiredby FDIC regulation in effect on January 1, 1989, or the official savingsassociation sign which insured savings associations must display.The FDIC is required to prescribe regulations to carry out the purposesof section 221 of FIRRE, including regulations governing the manner ofdisplay or use of such signs, except that the size of the savings associationsign shall be similar to the bank sign. Accordingly, the FDIC is issuingthis final rule to prescribe the sign insured savings associations mustdisplay and the locations where the sign must be displayed. The final rulegives insured banks the option of displaying the official bank sign orthe official savings association sign prescribed for savings associations.Insured savings associations are authorized to display the official savingsassociation sign created by FIRRE but not the official bank sign.The FDIC regulation presently in effect requires an insured bank to displayan official sign at each station or window where insured deposits are usuallyand normally received in its principal place of business and in all itsbranches. This requirement has not been changed by this final rule exceptthat banks may now display the official bank sign or the official savingsassociation sign prescribed for insured savings associations. This finalrule requires an insured savings association to display the sign prescribedby FIRRE at each station or window where insured deposits are usually andnormally received in its principal place of business and in all its branches.Prior to the enactment of FIRRE, section 18 of the Federal Deposit InsuranceAct specifically required an insured bank to include in advertisementsa statement to the effect that its deposits were insured by the FDIC. FIRREdoes not retain this specific requirement. It appears the FDIC has theauthority to retain its regulation requiring insured banks to include thecurrently prescribed statement in advertisements and to extend similarrequirements to insured savings associations. Since section 18 of the FederalDeposit Insurance Act as amended by FIRRE no longer mandates a statementof insurance coverage in advertisements, however, the FDIC believes itis appropriate at this time to review the benefits and costs of such arequirement. In conjunction therewith, the FDIC notes that section 222of FIRRE adds a new section 28 to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Thisnewly enacted section provides that any savings association the depositsof which are not insured by the FDIC shall disclose clearly and conspicuouslyin periodic statements of account and in all advertising that the savingsassociation's deposits are not federally insured. This final rule, therefore,retains the advertising requirements applicable to insured banks but doesnot extend them to insured savings associations. The FDIC invites commenton this issue through a separately published ``Advance Notice of ProposedRulemaking'' published elsewhere in this issue.This final rule eliminates the reference to the ``Official Catalogue ofInsured Bank Signs'' since this catalogue is no longer published.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required under section 553of the Administrative Procedure Act or any other law, the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601-602) does not apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 328</ITAG>Advertising, Bank deposit insurance, Banks, Banking, Savings and loan associations,Savings associations, Signs and symbols.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 328_ADVERTISEMENT OF MEMBERSHIP</ITAG>1.
