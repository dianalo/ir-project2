Filings confirm earlier indications that Jet Capital, which is 50.7% owned by Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo, is preparing to change its traditional passive role as a holding company for Texas Air securities. Jet Capital has 34% of the voting power of Texas Air securities. Other owners besides Mr. Lorenzo include a small group of Texas Air officers, directors and their associates.    In recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jet Capital said it might pursue majority positions in businesses outside the airline industry or lease aircraft to other companies. Jet Capital said also in the filings that it might acquire, either directly or through Texas Air, controlling interests in other airlines or airline-related businesses.    The filings follow previously reported moves by Mr. Lorenzo that indicate he isn't content to concentrate on his vast airline empire, which includes Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines.    Until recently, Jet Capital was an obscure holding company that held Texas Air shares and cooperated in Texas Air's purchases of stock in other airlines. But earlier this year, Jet Capital raised capital by selling stock to a small group of Texas Air officials, opened an office in New York and hired a mergers and acquisitions specialist as president. Texas Air also asked its shareholders last month to strengthen Jet Capital's voting control of Texas Air.    A Texas Air spokesman, who declined to further detail Jet Capital's plans, said he doubted that Jet Capital's new interests would affect Texas Air. Kevin S. Moore, Jet Capital's recently hired president, was away from his office and unavailable for comment.    In its latest SEC filing, Jet Capital was seeking to continue its existing exemption from the administrative burdens placed on concerns that the SEC classifies as investment companies. The request for an exemption was necessary because Jet Capital wanted to diversify beyond airline holdings, a spokesman for the SEC said. He added that the request was considered routine, and is likely to be approved unless Jet Capital holders raise objections. </TEXT></DOC>
