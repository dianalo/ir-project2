In FY 1988-89, SAN proposes:development of critically needed, high-horsepower, downhole productionpumps with industry; improvement of high-temperature downhole tools forSalton Sea scientific measurements; integrated analysis of geosciencesdata, for targeting of Sandia's deep magma drilling; significant improvementin fracture detection and measurement instruments and data analysis;evaluation of Pacific Northwest and Cascades geothermal potential withBonneville Power and USGS; modeling brine chemistry and monitoring brineflow for control of scale, corrosion, and particulates in geothermalpower plants; development of advanced materials, toxic removal, metalsrecovery, and encapsulation of geothermal residues, with industry; and,continuation of cooperative research with Mexico, focusing on fracturedvolcanic reservoirs and start-up of the former Baca 50 MW power plant.</TEXT></DOC>
