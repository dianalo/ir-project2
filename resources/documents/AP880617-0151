The United States, which sometimes vetoes measures to shieldSouth Africa, declined to exercise its veto and allowed the mercyplea to pass. It was a clear signal to the Pretoria government ofWashington's displeasure with plans to execute the so-called``Sharpeville Six.''   On Thursday, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar appealedfor clemency.   The council said it was convinced that the executions, ifcarried out, would ``further inflame an already grave situation inSouth Africa.''   It called ``once again upon the South African authorities tostay execution and commute the death sentences imposed on theSharpeville Six.''   In March the 15-member Security Council appealed to the SouthAfrican government to grant clemency to the six. The councilfrequently condemns South Africa for its system of apartheid butSouth Africa says the U.N. group has no right to interfere indomestic affairs.   The six were convicted of participating in a 1984 riot in whicha black Sharpeville town councilor was killed. But they were notfound to have joined in the physical assault.   The members of the council are the United States, Britain,China, France and the Soviet Union _ the permanent five nuclearpowers _ and Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Nepal,Senegal, West Germany, Yugoslavia and Zambia.   The United States frequently vetoes Security Councildenunciations of South Africa and its calls for sanctions againstthe government. But the United States sometimes declines toexercise its veto and allows certain critical resolutions to pass.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which South Africa's 26 million black majority has novote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economyand maintain separate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
