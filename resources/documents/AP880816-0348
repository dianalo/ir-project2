(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hewlett-Packard Co. is impressingcustomers, if not Wall Street, with new computers and appears onthe way to its goal of $10 billion in annual sales entering its50th year of business in 1989.   At a meeting of more than 2,000 customers in Florida last week,Hewlett-Packard enjoyed a wealth of plaudits for its Spectrum lineof minicomputers.   That wealth, though, hasn't yet affected Hewlett-Packard's stockprice, which plunged $1.50 a share Tuesday to a new low for theyear, $45.87{. Hewlett-Packard's 52-week high was $73.62{.   ``This is clearly a huge panic on the technology stocks in fearof inflation and recession in 1989,'' said Adam Cuhney of Kidder,Peabody andamp; Co. ``There isn't a lot of substantive reason to see aderailment of good high-tech companies like Hewlett-Packard.''   John A. Young, Hewlett-Packard's president and chief executiveofficer, scared investors with gloomy comments in June about U.S.orders in the third quarter, the effects of higher prices forscarce dynamic random access memory chips and a Defense Departmentfreeze on certain orders.   The higher cost of DRAM chips led to a price increase of up to25 percent for some of Hewlett-Packard's computer memories in July.   Hewlett-Packard is scheduled to report its third-quarterearnings on Wednesday.   Cuhney is forecasting a 24 percent rise in revenue for the thirdquarter and profits of 87 cents per share versus 57 cents per sharelast year.   That's a little higher than most other forecasts. Jeff Canin ofHambrecht andamp; Quist Inc. said the market is worried Hewlett-Packard'sdomestic bookings won't match last year's record $1.19 billion.   Cuhney said he expected a 3 percent rise in U.S. orders and a 34percent rise in foreign orders. ``Just to be up 3 percent on theU.S. side is a major accomplishment, considering the strength oflast year's U.S. sales in the third quarter.''   As it approaches the half-century mark, Hewlett-Packard isstepping up its assault on computer giants Digital Equipment Corp.and International Business Machines Corp. while using a $1.5billion hoard to invest in small companies and buy back stock.   Hewlett-Packard agreed last week to buy 10 percent of OctelCommunications Corp., a voice-messaging firm in Milpitas, Calif.,for about $27 million. On Monday, Hewlett-Packard said it hadformed a partnership with Telecom Australia.   Both were relatively small deals, but indicative ofHewlett-Packard's move away from its traditional base in scientificinstruments.   ``Those are strictly strategic moves and don't mean the companyis going on a buying binge,'' Cuhney said.   Adds Canin: ``For all intents and purposes, Hewlett-Packard is acomputer company today with a very impressive line.''   Two weeks ago, Hewlett-Packard announced several changes in itstop-level management to reflect the rising importance of itsworldwide computer business, which accounted for $5 billion of thecompany's $8.1 billion overall revenue last year.   Hewlett-Packard is expanding in all directions, makingterminals, personal computers, engineering workstations, networks,laser printers, software and minicomputers while maintaining itsreputation for quality medical and scientific instruments.   Hewlett-Packard even brought in former Pittsburgh Steelersquarterback Terry Bradshaw, teammate Lynn Swann and Coach ChuckNoll for a football rally-type talk to nearly 800 salesmen.   Young bet the company a few years ago on the promise ofSpectrum, which is based on a technology called Risc, or reducedinstruction-set computing.   Risc relies on much fewer circuit elements than traditionaldesigns, such as Digital's Vax, and should make it easier forHewlett-Packard to engineer compatible Spectrum models of differentsizes. The technology also gives users more bang for the buck.   In its 49th year, Hewlett-Packard has added about 1,000engineering, marketing and sales personnel to reach 83,000 workersworldwide. That's still about 1,000 workers less than its 1985peak, when the company trimmed down with voluntary severance andretirement programs to cope with an industry slowdown.</TEXT></DOC>
