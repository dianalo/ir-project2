(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   AFL-CIO leaders opened their annualmeeting Monday with an eye on domestic policy, backing a broadcongressional agenda that includes calls for a higher minimum wage,day care and parental leave.   The 35-member Executive Council of the labor federation also metwith Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. On Tuesday, unionleaders plan to sit down with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.   The council issued four policy statements on its domesticpriorities, including one on the needs of working families thatcalled for passage of bills guaranteeing parental leave andexpanding day care opportunities.   ``The working standards and social services provided by theselegislative initiatives will enable workers to be both productiveemployees and responsible family members,'' the statement said. ``Aswe promote the economic security and stability of families, weadvance the economic and social health of the nation.''   The federation also promised full support of 9,000 Machinists whoare set to strike against Eastern Airlines on March 4. TheMachinists are threatening to picket other carriers that haveservice agreements with Eastern or its parent corporation, Texas Air.   The council also established a committee to study the needs ofworking families and suggest changes in laws and contract language.   In calling for an increase in the minimum wage, which has beenfrozen at $3.35 for eight years, the 1.9-million member labororganization said it would take $4.56 to purchase what $3.35 boughtwhen that level was set in 1981.   Legislation sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., wouldincrease the minimum wage to $4.55 through three annual increases of40 cents.   Mitchell, after his meeting with the labor leaders, said he wouldbring to the Senate floor for debate a minimum wage bill that doesnot contain a sub-minimum youth training wage that President Bushhas said would have to be included for him to support it.   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and Mitchell said it was tooearly to rate Bush's relationship with labor, but both said the newpresident was off to a better start than President Reagan, whoserelationship with labor was acrimonious from the outset.   ``The atmosphere has changed considerably and I certainly welcomethat,'' Kirkland said. ``We still have to see what the concreteproduct is.''</TEXT></DOC>
