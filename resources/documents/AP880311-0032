Donald Riegle has returned campaigncontributions made by employees and officers of an Arizona companyon whose behalf he met with federal bank regulators conducting aninvestigation.   Riegle said Thursday he wanted to avoid the appearance of aconflict of interest and so was giving back $76,100 incontributions from people associated with American Continental Co.of Phoenix, Ariz., and its subsidiaries.   Three other senators present at the meeting last year saidthrough aides they saw no reason to return the money. An aide to afourth senator was unable to say whether the contributions would bereturned.   ``While there was no conflict of interest involved, before orafter these contributions, even the appearance of such a personalconflict should be enough to warrant the return of thesecontributions, and that is what I have done,'' said Riegle, aMichigan Democrat up for re-election this year who sits on theSenate Banking Committee.   Riegle and Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Alan Cranston,D-Calif.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; and John McCain, R-Ariz., met lastApril 9 with Federal Home Loan Bank Board examiners and discussedthe investigation of an American Continental subsidiary, LincolnSavings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.   There was no connection between the meeting and the agency'sdecision to end its probe of high-risk investments made by thesubsidiary, Riegle said last month.   The meeting was called by DeConcini, said Riegle's presssecretary, Mike Russell. DeConcini had received $43,000 in campaigncontributions from American Continental officers and employees.   Cranston received $41,900 in contributions; Glenn, $34,000; andMcCain, $112,000.   ``It is foolishness to assume that just because employees of acompany make a contribution to a DeConcini campaign, that thatcompany can no longer go to Sen. DeConcini and request the samekind of constitutent service that any other individual or companywould expect,'' said DeConcini's press secretary, Bob Maynes.   Aides to McCain and Glenn also said the senators would notreturn the contributions because they saw no reason to do so.   Cranston's press secretary, Victoria Lion, said the senator wasout of the country and she was unable to determine whether he hador intended to return his American Continental campaigncontributions.   The contributions were legal under federal election laws.   Russell said Riegle believed returning the contributions wouldput to rest questions about the propriety of his having acceptedthe money.   ``He made a personal decision last weekend,'' Russell said.``This was the first time in his 22 years of public service that aconflict of interest had been raised.''
