(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge who sat on the bench for 17 yearsabused his power to get cut-rate bank loans, demanded bribes from anattorney and staff and forced court employees to do personal chores,prosecutors said Tuesday.   Joseph F. O'Kicki, 59, stands accused of a decade of violationsas judge, including extortion, bribery, open lewdness and coercion.He has denied the charges. He also faces a second trial on 16 countsrelated to more private charges.   ``We don't mean to say Judge O'Kicki was a corrupt judge in everycase,'' said Deputy Attorney General Lawrence Claus in his openingstatement. But O'Kicki ``definitely abused the very powers, theprivileges and the responsibilities which were conferred upon him byyou.''   The suspended judge frequently wrote on a yellow legal pad as theprosecutor described 13 incidents cited in 11 counts of publiccorruption. His wife, Sylvia, sat at his side and also took notes.   O'Kicki's trial has been the talk of this community in thefoothills of the Allegheny Mountains in central Pennsylvania.   At times, it has verged on soap opera, with allegations that thejudge ordered secretaries to take dictation while he was in hisunderpants or naked, and that he ordered court workers to chop hiswood and feed his dogs.   About 20 observers, including reporters, were scatteredthroughout the large, ornate courtroom where O'Kicki took his oathas president judge 1{ years ago.   Defense attorney James Yelovich later told visiting Judge RichardGrifo of Northampton County he would wait to present his openingstatement until the prosecution had rested its case.   During his 45-minute opening argument, Claus told the jurynumerous documents will be presented during the trial to proveO'Kicki's guilt.   Claus said O'Kicki used his influence to secure lower interest ona $10,000 bank loan in 1986. The prosecutor said the judge also hada staff member pay him $500 in exchange for a better job with thecounty and ordered him and another court employee to performpersonal tasks for him on county time.   Last March, a state grand jury recommended O'Kicki be chargedwith 13 years' worth of violations, including extortion, bribery,lewdness and coercion. He was elected to his first 10-year term as ajudge in 1971 and re-elected in 1981.   Although the grand jury recommended 76 charges, most of thosewere dismissed, withdrawn or combined with other charges.Twenty-seven remain, 11 of which involve public corruption and 16 ofwhich involve more private charges.   The first witness, auto dealer Allen Black, said O'Kicki bought aPontiac Sunbird from his family's dealership in 1984. He testifiedthat on one contract, the judge signed his full name then crossed itout and instead wrote ``Judge O'Kicki.''   ``He said `My name is judge,''' Black said.   An $8,000 loan was financed through Laurel Bank of Ebensburg,Black said.   Charles Horne, a vice president of Laurel and former car loanofficer, said he was told O'Kicki was paying $1,298 as a downpayment on the Sunbird. Horne said he didn't know until the trialthat O'Kicki's check totaled only $298.   Horne said it's difficult to say whether he would have approvedthe loan if he had known O'Kicki was putting down only $298 in cash.</TEXT></DOC>
