LOUIS -- General Dynamics Corp. said shareholdersoverwhelmingly approved a board proposal to revamp acontroversial compensation plan, which has provided more than$20 million in bonuses for the company's top 25 executives.   Holders of 85.2% of the 37.9 million shares represented atthe special meeting here voted for the executive-compensationplan and other employee incentive programs to be overhauled,the defense contractor said.</LP><TEXT>   Speaking at the meeting, Chairman William Anders also saidGeneral Dynamics now anticipates reporting a 1991 year-endcash balance of about $800 million, an increase over earlierestimates. He reiterated that &quot;we expect to return excesscash to shareholders in some manner.&quot; In late trading on theNew York Stock Exchange yesterday, General Dynamics shareswere quoted at $58, down 37.5 cents.   The compensation plan granted credits equal to double anexecutive's base salary every time the company's stockclimbed 10 points and stayed there for 10 trading days. Thechanges that were approved substitute that setup with a moretraditional stock-option arrangement, thereby introducingmore downside risk into the equation. As part of thetermination of the plan, however, a partial award totalingabout $4.5 million was made to the executives to reflect theappreciation in the stock price since the last time thethreshold was hit.   The plan had come under fire with employees andshareholder rights groups. But Mr. Anders, who himself wonnearly $3 million under the plan, praised it for havinghelped improve &quot;current company performance and long-termcompany prospects.&quot; General Dynamics recently moved itsheadquarters to Falls Church, Va., from St. Louis.</TEXT></DOC>
