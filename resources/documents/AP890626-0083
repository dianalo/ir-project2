The action comes 11 days after the justices ruled that Congresshas the power to strip state governments of their constitutionalimmunity against private lawsuits.   At issue in the Colorado case was whether such state immunityshould be overcome. Lower courts said no.   A policy of the Colorado Department of Labor's division ofemployment and training of refusing to pay unemployment benefits tosome previously employed aliens lawfully living in the state sparkeda 1984 lawsuit.   The suit sought to have the policy declared a violation of theFederal Unemployment Tax Act and to collect benefits it alleged werewrongfully withheld.   A federal trial judge ruled that the aliens would have to pursuetheir claims through state administrative proceedings. The aliensappealed, but the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed thesuit Nov. 29.   Noting that state court rulings and changes in immigration lawmade clear that the aliens were eligible for unemployment benefits,the appeals court rendered moot the need for future relief.   Regarding the claims for back benefits, the 10th Circuit courtsaid the 11th Amendment prohibits such a raid on the state treasuryin federal court.   The amendment says: ``The judicial power of the United Statesshould not be construed to extend to any suit ... (against a state)by citizens of another state or by citizens or subjects of anyforeign state.''   In decisions dating back to 1890, the Supreme Court has barredanyone, in-state or out, from suing an unconsenting state _ or stateofficials if the real target is a state's treasury. But in recentyears, the court has allowed some federal court lawsuits againststates.   In the case today, lawyers for the aliens said the 10th Circuitcourt's bar on federal suits to recover back unemployment benefitswas in conflict with rulings by other federal appeals courts.   The case is Esparza vs. Valdez, 88-1432.</TEXT></DOC>
