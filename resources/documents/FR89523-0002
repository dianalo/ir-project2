Amongthe 1986 Amendments was a new requirement that adversely affected workersfiling claims for trade readjustment allowances must participate in a jobsearch program as defined in the amendments, and that a worker who, withoutjustifiable cause, failed to begin participation in, or ceased to participatebefore completing, a job search program would be ineligible for trade readjustmentallowances.A proposed rule for implementing the 1986 Amendments, including the jobsearch program requirement, was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 22, 1987, at 52 FR 39586. A commenteron the proposed rule noted that a definition of the term ``justifiablecause'' was not included in the proposal. The final rule, which includeda definition of ``justifiable cause'' for the purposes of the job searchprogram requirement, was published on August 24, 1988, effective September23, 1988, at 53 FR 32344, with a post-publication comment period on thedefinition of ``justifiable cause'' ending on September 23, 1988.No comment was received on the definition of ``justifiable cause''. Accordingly,the definition of ``justifiable cause'' is adopted as a final rule withoutchange. As noted in the final rule published on August 24, 1988, this definitionof ``justifiable cause'' became effective on September 23, 1988.One printing error is corrected in 20 CFR 617.14(a)(2), as it appearedin the final rule of the 1986 Amendments which was published on August24, 1988, at 53 FR 32349.
