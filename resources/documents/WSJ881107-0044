The decision calls for planned production of 1.8 million ounces of silver next year from the Elsa site, which accounts for all of the company's silver output. The company produced 1.5 million ounces of silver in 1987 and said it expects to produce about 1.7 million ounces this year.    United Keno, 33%-owned by Falconbridge Ltd., cited high operating losses resulting from continuing low silver prices and a shortage of skilled miners and tradesmen for the decision. As previously reported, United Keno had a loss for the first nine months of six million Canadian dollars (US$4.9 million), which widened from C$2 million a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
