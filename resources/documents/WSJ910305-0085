Ask LowellRott. After his small, debt-ridden farm here was auctionedoff on the courthouse steps in 1986, he slept for a time inhis 1973 Dodge pickup. Now he's a squatter in an abandonedtwo-room house with no running water.   There isn't much demand for 50-year-old farmers like him.A high-school dropout, he works as a handyman for $10 a dayand shower privileges. The faded old suit he wears for jobinterviews in town hasn't made him any more attractive. Hisface is streaked with cinders from a wood stove thatgenerates so little heat he wears a parka to bed. Hestubbornly keeps a hand in farming by raising castoff horseson the land of sympathetic neighbors. &quot;The horses arehomeless and so am I,&quot; he says. &quot;We belong together.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   A surprising -- and growing -- number of rural homelesslike Mr. Rott are seeking shelter wherever they can find it:in caves near Glenwood Springs, Colo., under bridges in DesMoines, Iowa, and in junk cars close to Coventry, Vt. Ascramble is on to build shelters in small towns fromBoonville, Mo., to Wilmington, Ohio.   Many small towns can't cope. They lack soup kitchens,subsidized housing, federal grant dollars and sometimes thebureaucratic savvy to snag such funds. Some rural communitieshave been slow to recognize a homelessness problem thatshakes their idyllic self-image.   Some of the homeless are leaving big cities in search ofsafer streets and cheaper rent. But many of them are localpeople, thrown out of work by the farm depression of the'80s, displaced by the national recession of 1991 or crowdedout of shelter by a declining stock of housing.   They have escaped the national attention attracted by theurban problem because they're scattered over remote areas. Inaddition, many are still in a transition stage ofhomelessness -- they're still being sheltered by friends orsympathetic onlookers -- so they're not yet out on the streetand thus less visible. University of Colorado public-policyresearcher Roger Carver calls the rural homeless &quot;thenation's hidden homeless: out of sight, out of mind.&quot;   No one knows how many homeless people there are in ruralareas nationwide -- and any survey of homeless people isbound to be a very rough estimate. But an Ohio StateUniversity study put that state's rural homeless at 20,000,triple the estimated total in 1984. Officials in NewHampshire say the homeless in the countryside there havequadrupled to 8,000 in the last decade. Iowa figures it hasabout 2,500 people in shelters.   All this is awakening communities like Glenwood Springs,Colo., to the problems of the late 20th century. A decadeago, the rare down-and-out person could count on someone inthe town of 7,000 to offer a spare bed and a meal, says MaryWierenga, a veteran police officer there. &quot;Now there are justtoo many,&quot; she says. The town's concern has sometimes turnedto cynicism. When a homeless man sleeping on a sidewalkrecently rolled under the wheels of a moving car, sufferingseveral broken bones, some residents nicknamed him&quot;Speed-bump.&quot;   The good will of many small towns is severely strained,and they are wrestling with their consciences. OutsideWashington, Iowa, an abandoned county-supported poorhouse inthe corn fields is being converted with a federal grant intoa homeless shelter for 60 people, and the waiting listalready stands at 12 families. But many dread it will becomea mecca to the poor for miles around. &quot;I have a spiritualside, but I'm worried about ruining a good town,&quot; saysRaphael Gonshorowski, a councilman in Washington, where thedesperate appearance of some homeless people has residentslocking their cars for the first time.   The problem has been building for a while. Many ruralcommunities saw the earning power of their poorest workersshrink in the 1980s as some manufacturers cut wages and jobsshifted to the low-paying service sector. Measured in 1989dollars, the pay of a worker in the bottom 10% of wageearners in Iowa dropped 16% to $241 a week in 1988 from $286a week in 1979, according to Thomas F. Pogue, a University ofIowa economics professor.   Unemployment in Washington has fallen by half from fiveyears ago. But many of the new jobs are part-time at aWal-Mart store, or in a neighboring county at a meat-packingplant, where turnover is high. Homeless people in WashingtonCounty (pop. 19,439) number about 150; there weren't enoughto count five years ago. Since then, the ranks of thosedipping into the county's tiny relief fund have tripled. &quot;Alot of people are working for $4-an-hour nowadays,&quot; saysMarian McCreery, who heads the state's welfare office there.&quot;That isn't enough.&quot; (The minimum wage is $3.80.)   Seemingly, the population decline in rural America in the1980s would have left cheap places for the homeless to go.But, in many rural towns, there is an acute shortage ofaffordable and inhabitable housing. Construction hasevaporated because values collapsed amid the farm failuresand plant closings of the past decade. Meanwhile, homes aregetting older. In Iowa between 1980 and 1987, more housingunits were knocked down than new ones built, resulting in aloss big enough to erase a city the size of Ames, Iowa. Rentshaven't gone up enough to spur construction, but they havegone up enough to put some people on the street.   Lisa Bohlen, a single mother of two in Washington, foundthat a 40% rise in rents over the past three yearsoverwhelmed her wages as a temporary store clerk and kitchenhelper. Now she and the children are staying with a friend --she sleeps in the dining room, they sleep in a bedroom -- butshe worries that the welcome is wearing thin. &quot;I never knewof anyone being homeless around here,&quot; she says. &quot;Now, I am.&quot;   Rents in rural America are much lower than in cities, ofcourse, but rent is only part of the problem. After StephenCapell lost his job as a welder in Los Angeles two years ago,his house was repossessed and he headed for Glenwood Springs,Colo. But to get an apartment there -- even one at $300 amonth -- requires roughly $600 for a deposit and one month'srent. So Mr. Capell, who is 43 years old, lives in a cave inthe Rocky Mountains outside of Glenwood Springs. A flickeringoil lantern illuminates the 20-foot-high ceiling of his cave,which he says reminds him of a tomb. &quot;I believe I'm capableof more than this, worth more than this,&quot; he says.   He is one of at least six people living in the cluster ofcaves, which are warmed by hot springs. Muddy wool blanketsare draped over the openings, and smoke from cooking fireshangs in the air. A growling 125-pound Rottweiler guards oneof the caves, which is inhabited by an unemployedconstruction worker who says he is too embarrassed to givehis name. Nearby, a woman is hanging clothes washed in acreek on a line strung between two sticks. Families withchildren sometimes sleep in the caves, but the climb up istoo hazardous for most.   Some people have migrated here partly to escape big-cityviolence. &quot;I got rolled in Phoenix and Denver,&quot; says TimTravelstead. &quot;People are nicer out here. In the big city, I'mjust a skid-row bum.&quot; But what little research existsindicates that the homeless are often subject to crime inrural areas, too.   Larry Sumpter worries about life for his family in theSalvation Army shelter in Columbia, Mo. The only suchfacility for families in Boone County, it handles 70% morepeople than it did four years ago. The shelter operates inthe red because it has had to quadruple the number of beds to42.   Mr. Sumpter, his wife and three children -- one just twomonths old -- have been in the shelter for a month. He ranout of cash after losing a job delivering farm produce.Another prospective employer rejected him when he gave hisaddress at the Salvation Army. &quot;It was the first time anybodyever called me a `transient,' and it doesn't seem right. Idon't turn down work of any kind, and I have goodreferences,&quot; he says. Mr. Sumpter, 38, stands in line to landtemporary jobs at a day-labor service and made $3.85 ringinga bell for Salvation Army donations. His wife, Tammy, is amotel maid.   They fret over their 15-year-old daughter's dislike ofschool, where classmates have taunted her about being broke.After her parents leave for work, teen-ager Glenda babysitsand struggles to maintain her dignity in the face ofuninvited sexual advances from some men in the shelter. &quot;Justto go to sleep at night without strangers all around would beso nice,&quot; she says.   Donald Ruthenberg, president of nearby Columbia College,says he is quietly allowing homeless families brief stays inthe small school's empty dormitory rooms. &quot;I suppose it couldbe a problem if certain people knew, what with securityworries these days,&quot; he says. &quot;But what am I supposed to dowhen I see parents and little children walking around town atdusk with nowhere to go?&quot;   Ronald V. Good is asking the same question in Washington,Iowa. He is a transplanted Reformed Presbyterian pastor andpart-time jailer from suburban Pittsburgh who got communitysupport for the new homeless shelter by pulling heart stringsand pushing old-fashioned principles. He cast the renovationof the poorhouse as &quot;transitional housing&quot; and promised to betough on bums. He bolstered his credibility by walloping twobullies on the town square for ridiculing his bald head.   Inspecting work on the shelter, which is slated to open inMay, Mr. Good pats the beds and lumber he persuaded localfirms to donate. He peers through a dirty window at the plotof land he envisions families using to raise goats andvegetables. &quot;There should be at least one advantage to beinghomeless in the countryside,&quot; he says.   But many small towns can't afford a shelter and are afraidof drawing more poor to their doorstep. Others are torn byrural values such as self-reliance and independence. &quot;There'sa `Lone Ranger' mentality out here -- a belief that everyoneshould make it on their own,&quot; says Tere Wilson, a formerpriest at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Durango, Colo. Heresigned from that church largely because congregationmembers such as Dorothy Gore objected to his putting 20homeless people in a church hallway. &quot;The church isn't theplace for the homeless,&quot; says Ms. Gore, a retiree who takesdaily walks through the surrounding historic neighborhood.&quot;We just couldn't have the homeless there: the smells, themess of their grease from their cooking in the kitchen.&quot;   In Cambridge, Ohio, Mayor C. Charles Shaw says he vetoed a$48,000 federal grant to build a shelter partly because hefeared it would become a &quot;beacon&quot; for transients. So aprivate group there quietly runs a shelter of its own. ButEvelyn King, the city's housing program manager, worries thather volunteer work there jeopardizes her job. &quot;People heredon't want to see the homeless,&quot; she says. &quot;But we'restarting to have plenty of them in junk cars, abandonedbuildings and dealing with Mother Nature.&quot;   Street people are almost beyond the imagination of manyresidents in Manchester, Iowa. Nestled among lush farms, thetown is just up the road from the site of the movie &quot;Field ofDreams.&quot; Local leaders dismiss a 1989 survey showing 745people in the county were doubling up with friends or family,helping give the county the highest homeless rate in thestate.   &quot;The homeless are people on the street. We don't have thatproblem,&quot; says Jim Wiewel, president of the First State Bankof Manchester. &quot;We want people to see us as a viablecommunity. A high homeless rate doesn't help.&quot; Some officialsin the county didn't cooperate with a 1990 statewide homelesssurvey, the official results of which haven't been releasedyet.   In Columbia, Mo., officials shun the idea of acity-supported shelter. &quot;It's hard for me to see our homelessthe same as those in a big city,&quot; says Lila Dewell, managerof city community services. &quot;We were ranked the fifth mostlivable place in the country by Money magazine. We're awonderful place.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
