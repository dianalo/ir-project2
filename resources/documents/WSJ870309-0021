GalanteStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ENVIRONMENT (ENV)ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) </IN><TEXT>   THE NATION'S hazardous-waste problem is turning out to be a boon to many small businesses. Federally mandated efforts to clean up contaminated sites and reduce pollution are spurring the creation of hundreds of companies that provide such services.    Although most of the businesses are closely held, Wall Street has already warmed to the industry. &quot;The prospects and the company dynamics lead us to be fundamentally excited about the industry,&quot; says Marc Sulam, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. One example of the potential: Maecorp, a Homewood, Ill., company incorporated last June to neutralize hazardous waste through chemical treatment, expects first-year revenue of $12 million, according to Philip Newton, president.    The main factor driving the industry is last October's congressional reauthorization of the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund cleanup program. The action authorizes the EPA to spend $9 billion mopping up toxic-waste sites over the next five years. In addition, the 1984 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act is expected to force manufacturers and other types of businesses to spend billions more on cleanup and pollution-control measures.    THE COMPANIES BEING CREATED cover a gamut of services. Many are consulting and engineering firms that identify problem sites and design solutions. Others perform the actual cleanups, using a variety of methods to solidify, destroy or otherwise make the wastes manageable. Still others offer ancillary services such as laboratory analysis, well-drilling, transportation, and training in toxic-waste management.    Small businesses are especially suited to the industry because they can provide the specialization it requires. Each waste site, pollutant and remedial technology is unique. &quot;There are no cure-alls in this business,&quot; says Richard J. Defieux, a general partner in Princeton/Montrose Partners, a venture-capital concern that backs companies in the industry. &quot;There are a bunch of guys running for niches. And the niches are very big.&quot;    Congress created those niches by changing the nation's approach to handling hazardous waste. Rather than burying waste in landfills that have proved leaky, the legislation emphasizes destruction and permanent detoxification of waste. &quot;It's now viable for us to come in with a chemical treatment and not only be competitive in price (with landfill storage) but also cheaper,&quot; says Maecorp's Mr. Newton.    The EPA itself is about to give new impetus to small-business participation in the industry. Until now, the agency has contracted with a single company to do emergency cleanups in each of the EPA's four administrative regions. But to increase competition, the agency is adding 18 more contracts to the program. The EPA also plans to increase the number of engineering companies studying contaminated sites. &quot;What I'm trying to do is create a lot more competition,&quot; says J. Winston Porter, the EPA's assistant administrator for solid waste and emergency response. &quot;Most of the people working in the program will be small businesses.&quot;    THE EPA ALSO IS HELPING small businesses enter the industry by sponsoring projects for them to demonstrate new waste-treatment technologies. For example, it selected a two-year-old company in Katy, Texas, called Hazcon Inc. to demonstrate a method of solidifying sludge and liquid waste for permanent, safe burial. Another small company, Detox Industries Inc. of Sugarland, Texas, will demonstrate under EPA auspices a method of using microorganisms to biologically degrade polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.    Detox's experience, however, also illustrates one of the risks small companies face in the hazardous-waste business. It took two years for Detox to win EPA approval for its biodegradation technology, a long time for a small business to wait for sales.    Even more significant than the business risk, perhaps, is the possibility of legal problems. A waste-treatment company that accidentally worsens a contamination problem instead of correcting it runs the risk of costly liability litigation. &quot;In some sense, you're be tting the company every time you're out there on the job site,&quot; says Robert W. Dunlap, president of Remediation Technologies Inc., a Boston company that cleans up waste sites with a biodegradation process. Still, Mr. Dunlap says, &quot;If you've got an entrepreneurial bent and know what you're doing, this is a good market to be in.&quot;    WALL STREET SEEMS to agree. Investors have snapped up recent public offerings by waste-management companies. For example, Groundwater Technology Inc., a Norwood, Mass., company that went public last July at 18 1/2, currently is trading at around 39. Canonie Environmental Services Corp. of Porter, Ind., is trading at 30 after going public at 15 last September. And Chemical Waste Management Inc. of Oak Brook, Ill., has risen to around 30 from its October offering price of 17 1/4.    &quot;You're probably going to see more (hazardous-waste) companies come public because of the opportunity to raise money at high multiples,&quot; says Kidder Peabody's Mr. Sulam. Indeed, on Friday, Ecology andamp; Environment Inc. of Buffalo, N.Y., went public at 15, representing a price-earnings multiple of 25 over its earnings of the last 12 months. It finished its first day of trading at 21 7/8. </TEXT></DOC>
