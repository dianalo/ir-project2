KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congress late Friday approved a $14.3compromise foreign aid bill and sent it to President Reagan afterstripping out provisions that would have imposed punitive economicsanctions against Iraq for its alleged use of poison gas againstthe nation's Kurdish minority.   The House dropped the Iraqi sanctions, which had been added tothe bill earlier by the Senate, without debate after they wereruled out of order on procedural grounds. That sent the measureback to the Senate, which acceded to the action moments later, justone minute before the midnight deadline for passage of the bill.   Opponents of the sanctions cited State Department fears thatsuch a move would damage diplomatic efforts to persuade the Iraqisto forswear use of chemical weapons.   Also dropped from the bill were provisions barring the sale toChina of three U.S. satellites to be launched on the Chinese LongMarch missile until the president can certify that China is notselling missiles to Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya or Saudi Arabia andwill not do so in the future. The vote to kill that provision was234-23.   Opponents of that section of the bill argued that such aprohibition would derail delicate diplomatic arrangements withChina worked out by Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci on a recenttrip to Beijing.   ``We can be reasonably confident that if we defeat thisamendment, and the sale of American satellites to Australia forlaunch on Chinese rockets goes forward, they will not be sellingintermediate-range missiles to radical Arab countries in the MiddleEast,'' said Rep. Steven Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the HouseForeign Affairs Asia subcommittee.   In the same stroke, the House killed a Senate provision thatwould have allowed for prosecution or expulsion of foreigndiplomats who are accused of serious and violent crimes in theUnited States. House leaders said the provision would endangerreciprocal agreements protecting U.S. diplomats around the worldand would tempt a presidential veto of the entire bill.   The Senate and House earlier had passed different versions ofsanctions against Iraq, with the Senate approving a far moresweeping version than the House.   Earlier, the Senate shelved, 72-23, a bid by Sen. Howard H.Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, to force the Overseas Private Investment Corp.,OPIC, to end risk insurance to U.S. companies who set up industriesin foreign countries and export their products to the United States.   Metzenbaum said OPIC's operations cost U.S. jobs by permittingU.S. companies to produce their products more cheaply overseas.   The Senate also voted, 57-32, to block a bid by Sen.. StevenSymms, R-Idaho, to provide the World Bank with $50 million a yearfor the next six years to help finance its operations.   The overall foreign aid spending legislation shifts the emphasisto grants rather than loans for U.S. military assistance to foreigncountries.   Over the past few weeks, House and Senate negotiators drew up aprogram for overseas arms sales that will provide $3.8 billion inoutright grants and $410 million in loans made on favorable terms.   The agreement also retained the current military assistanceprogram with grants in fiscal year 1989 totaling $467 million.   As in the past, the largest recipients for military and economicaid were Israel and Egypt, which receive substantial supportbecause of their 1979 peace treaty.   Israel would receive $1.2 billion in economic aid and $1.8billion in military assistance. Egypt would get $815 million ineconomic aid and $1.2 billion in military aid. All of the militaryaid for both countries would be in the form of grants.   Consideration of the Foreign Aid bill lacked the controversy ofrecent years, in part because of last year's agreement between theReagan administration and Congress that smoothed the way for theyear's money bills.   It would be the first time in seven years that a separateforeign aid bill has been approved. Usually it has been folded intocatchall spending bills as Congress rushed to adjourn.</TEXT></DOC>
