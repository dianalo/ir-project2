Fearful that prolonged delays in reconstructing thatbusiness may lock them out of markets they had longdominated, the Kuwaitis are moving swiftly to restart theirrefineries. The three huge complexes that are the centerpieceof the emirate's refining capability were severely damagedduring the Persian Gulf War.</LP><TEXT>   Underlying this new initiative is a hardening resolve toovercome Saddam Hussein's attempt to destroy Kuwait byshattering the oil industry on which the tiny emirate dependsfor the bulk of its income. &quot;We're not going to let theIraqis put us out of business,&quot; said Nader Sultan, presidentof Kuwait Petroleum International, a unit of government-ownedKuwait Petroleum Corp. &quot;We were a major center for the exportof oil products -- we want to get back to what we were.&quot;   Kuwait has for years been one of the Middle East's premierrefiners and marketers. Its sophisticated refineries havebeen major suppliers of Far Eastern markets and some Europeanones as well. Even the U.S. in recent years has started tolook to some Middle Eastern refiners for product supply asdomestic refining capacity waned.   The loss of any refining capacity puts an already strainedworld-wide system under more pressure. To be sure, a globaleconomic slowdown has helped to blunt the loss of the Kuwaiticapacity. But with the war over and economies reviving, ascramble for markets is picking up and the Kuwaitis areconcerned that they are going to lose out. The Saudis areagain looking to sell refined products they had previouslybeen hoarding for the war effort. Kuwait even facescompetition from Iraq. At last week's meeting of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Iraqi OilMinister Osama Abdul Razzak Al-Hiti said that all of Iraq'srefineries would be operating at pre-war capacity byyear-end.   Until now, the Kuwaitis have been pouring all theirefforts into putting out the oil well fires set by the Iraqiarmy. More than 460 wells are still burning out of control,costing the Kuwaitis as much as $120 million a day in revenueor $45 billion a year, said Kuwaiti Oil Minister HomoudAl-Rqobah at the OPEC meeting.   But even with heroic efforts to put its refining businessback in operation, it's unlikely that Kuwait will be able toreturn to its prewar refining capacity of 765,000 barrels aday any time soon. The precise extent of the damage isunclear -- so far there has only been visual inspection ofthe three facilities. Bechtel Corp. is just beginning anin-depth investigation of the work that will be needed torestart the refineries.   One official involved in the effort says: &quot;We're nottrying to restore the refineries to their past glory; we'rejust trying to make them operational.&quot; Adds Antonio Szabo, aconsultant with Bonner andamp; Moore Associates Inc. in Houston,who has been following the situation: &quot;They're not yet keenon spending money they don't need to spend.&quot;   People who have seen the facilities say two of the fourloading piers that serve the refineries have been destroyed,as has one of two man-made islands used for loading gianttankers ten miles offshore. The Kuwaitis speculate thatSaddam Hussein was trying to cripple their country's abilityto export oil.   Despite the sabotage, the Kuwaitis hope the Mina Ahmadirefinery may be operational by the end of August orSeptember. But it will only be able to process 100,000 to170,000 barrels of oil a day. Prior to the war, the facilitywas able to handle about 280,000 barrels of crude daily. Butthe Iraqis damaged one of its crude units as well as somestorage tanks.   If their own oil fields aren't producing enough oil tokeep Mina Ahmadi running once the refinery comes back onstream, industry sources say the Kuwaitis may process SaudiArabian crude instead.   The Kuwaitis concede that preliminary inspection of theirthree refineries shows that at least one -- the Shuaiba -- isa total loss. Pipes leading up to the shipping pumps arecompletely destroyed, lying on the ground in a molten heapthat the Kuwaitis describe as &quot;spaghetti.&quot;   It's unlikely that Shuaiba will ever be rebuilt as it was.But the Kuwaitis refuse to abandon the site, saying that thethree refineries stand only several miles apart and make up asingle integrated system. They claim that a brand new andeven more sophisticated refinery will someday stand inShuaiba's place. Shuaiba was originally designed to producemostly middle distillates such as kerosene and gas oil, atype of heating oil. The Kuwaitis have already decided thatany new refinery would yield more gasoline rather than theless valuable middle distillate products.   But even though Shuaiba has been demolished, parts fromthe huge facility will be cannibalized for use at the othertwo refineries. For instance, shipping pumps, each the sizeof a room, still stand almost untouched at Shuaiba. Thesewill be moved over to Mina Abdullah, which lost all of itspumps to an Allied bombing raid during the war. The Alliescompletely destroyed Mina Abdullah's pumping capacity whenSaddam Hussein opened the spigot on the refinery's oil,creating a huge oil slick in the gulf. It would take up totwo years to replace those pumps if they had to be ordered.   Mina Abdullah could be back in operation by the end of theyear if the pumps can be installed. According to oneeyewitness, four explosive charges placed in each corner ofthe main control room completely obliterated Mina Abdullah'scomputerized control panels. But the Kuwaitis say they canjury-rig a control setup at each of the refinery's units inorder to operate the facility.</TEXT></DOC>
