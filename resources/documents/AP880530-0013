The official reaction to questions about Presser, about thejockeying for position on who might succeed him and about the newNational Master Freight Agreement is that the union is functioningsmoothly under Secretary-Treasurer Weldon Mathis.   ``Everybody hopes and is operating on the expectation Jackiewill be back,'' Duke Zeller, the union's chief spokesman, said lastweek. ``We all know his recuperative powers. For a power struggleto be going on, it's awfully quiet around here.''   However, insiders acknowledge that many of the 16 Teamster vicepresidents on the 1.6 million-member union's executive boarddisagree sharply over Mathis' stewardship while Presser has beenundergoing operations and extensive chemotherapy and radiationtreatments for cancer during the past 18 months.   The divisiveness has flared in recent weeks with the Teamsters'acceptance of a new trucking contract covering about 200,000 of itsmembers despite a nearly 2-to-1 rank-and-file vote against it.   Only half of the vice presidents showed up two weeks ago at aresort near Scottsdale, Ariz., and some of those absent openlyopposed the new three-year labor pact with the trucking industry.   The leader of the boycott was 70-year-old Joseph Trerotola ofNew York, the ranking and possibly most influential member on theTeamsters' board who directs the union's affairs in its biggeststronghold, New York and New Jersey.   An irony is that many of the board members who prevailed uponMathis to convene the meeting are the same ones who boycotted it.   ``What's amazing is that this infighting has all sloshed outinto the open,'' says Ken Paff, an organizer for a dissidentfaction, Teamsters for a Democratic Union. ``In the past, it's allbeen kept in the family.''   Paff's organization, which has close ties to consumer activistRalph Nader, filed suit on behalf of five union members in U.S.District Court in Washington last week seeking to overturn thetrucking contract on charges of ballot fraud in the ratificationvote.   Mathis called the claims ``ridiculous'' and accused theplaintiffs in the suit of trying to destroy the accord and thestandards that ``the Teamsters have fought long and hard for ourmembers to preserve.''   Until the union's constitution was changed two years ago,Trerotola rather than Mathis, a friendly, 62-year-old unionist whostarted his career as a business agent in an Atlanta local,automatically would have received the nod as interim head of theunion in Presser's absence.   Some Teamster insiders insisted last week that thelittle-noticed constitutional change at the union's 1986 conventionhad nothing to do with the personalities of the two men or othertop union officials.   Instead, they described it has a housecleaning measure agreedupon after Presser underwent a heart bypass operation in late 1983to assure that control of the union remained with officials at itsinternational headquarters in Washington.   But they and officials in other unions with close ties to theTeamsters say the change reflects Presser's gradual and cautiousmoves in the past five years to shift the balance of power in theunion from its secretive ``old guard'' to a new, moreimage-conscious generation of trade unionists.   Presser, 61, won the top post in the union in 1983 largely onhis own public relations efforts, which included serving onPresident Reagan's transition team and promoting a higher Teamsterprofile on Capitol Hill and in the press to counter longstandingcharges of corruption.   Three of the past six Teamster Presidents _ David Beck, JimmyHoffa and Roy Williams _ have been removed from office after beingsentenced to prison on tax evasion, jury tampering or briberyconvictions.   However, the government has largely thwarted Presser's campaignto improve the Teamsters' image. In late 1985, a White Housecommission alleged that both Presser and his predecessor, Williams,were handpicked for the union's presidency by organized crimefigures.   Six months later, a federal grand jury indicted Presser oncharges of helping embezzle $700,000 from a Cleveland local, whichhe also heads, through a ghost employees payroll padding scheme.   And Mathis told the AFL-CIO's executive council two weeks agothat the Teamsters have every reason to believe the governmentstill intends to file a civil suit seeking to oust all of theunion's top officials on a claim the Teamsters' leadership isdominated by racketeers.   Leaks from government officials about the anticipated suit lastyear prompted a mutual aid pact between the Teamsters and theAFL-CIO, which feared the precedent that a government victory mightset for other unions.   Bitter rivals for 30 years, they re-established formal ties inOctober, with the Teamsters being welcomed back into the 90-unionfederation.   The two Teamster officials most responsible for making thereaffiliation work have been Mathis and Walter Shea, a veteranWashington insider whose demeanor and image is more that of a StateDepartment diplomat than a labor leader.   Shea, a Teamsters vice president since 1982, is believed to beTrerotola's top choice as a challenger to Mathis to succeed Presser.   Other possible challengers include Joseph Morgan of Hallandale,Fla., and Donald Peters of Chicago _ both sought the job whenWilliams was sentenced to prison in 1983 _ and Arnie Weinmeister ofSeattle, director of the union's Western Conference.   ``Mathis has the inside track, but it's certainly not a smoothone,'' says Paff of the Teamsters for a Democratic Union.   Others closer to the Teamster leadership also expect a seriouschallenge to Mathis should Presser not return following a 120-dayleave of absence after undergoing surgery to remove a pair ofcancer tumors from his brain.   Asked if Mathis' critics could unite behind a single challengerto deny Mathis the Teamsters' presidency, one insider said,``That's the big question.''</TEXT></DOC>
