Democrats Jesse Jackson, Albert Gore Jr. and Gary Hart were injeopardy of losing their eligibility under an election-lawstipulation that starts the clock on dropping a candidate from thematching-funds category if he receives less than 10 percent in twosuccessive primaries.   In South Dakota, Gore had 8 percent and Hart and Jackson eachhad 5 percent. All three also finished in the single digits in NewHampshire last week, in the first primary of the campaign season.   Failing to get 10 percent in South Dakota does not mean animmediate cutoff because the law stays such action for 30 daysafter the primary. And candidates can qualify anew by getting 20percent of the vote in a future primary.   That means Jackson and Gore, who are expected to do well in theSuper Tuesday primaries on March 8, are likely to score the strongfinishes they need before the 30-day stay expires.   In 1984, Jackson lost his eligiblity because he fell below the10 percent threshhold in Nebraska and Oregon. But before the moneywas actually stopped, he had regained certification by winning 23.6percent in New Jersey.   Regardless of whether candidates have been disqualified fromreceiving matching funds to continue their campaigns, they cancontinue to receive matching payments to retire campaign debts thatwere incurred before the date of ineligibility, said spokesman FredEiland of the Federal Election Commission.   Matching funds from the federal Treasury have become the mannaof presidential campaigns, with the amount distributed to eachcandidate dependent on how much he raises privately.   The Federal Election Commission so far this year has handed outclose to $40 million to 14 candidates. Three of those candidateshave already dropped out of the race _ Democrat Bruce Babbitt andRepublicans Alexander Haig and Pete du Pont.   The fund matches each contribution of $250 or less that acandidate raises privately. The fund is supported by the $1checkoff on individual income tax forms under the public financingsystem set up in the mid-1970s by Congress.   The six-member Federal Election Commission votes on candidatecertification following a review of the campaign's finances by theFEC audit and legal staff.   To be certified, a candidate must raise $100,000 across 20states in contributions of $250 or less.   Vice President George Bush and Robertson have received the mostmatching funds for this year's election, each with more than $6.5million.   Jackson has received $621,828, Gore nearly $2 million, and Hart$1.1 million.   At a recent FEC meeting, commissioner Joan Aikens attacked whatshe described as an inequity in the law that allows an unopposedthird-party candidate, or a candidate who chooses not to compete inevery state, to continue receiving federal matching funds whileothers who place their names on every primary ballot face the riskof cutoff.   A candidate whose name is not on the ballot is not covered bythe 10 percent rule.</TEXT></DOC>
