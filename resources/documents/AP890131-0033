The program, which would have taken effect today, would require17,000 of the agency's 70,000 employees to be tested for drug use.   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene granted a preliminaryinjunction sought by the National Federation of Federal Employees.   In his 36-page opinion, Greene said the program is ``essentiallya show ... in which the civil servants employed at the InteriorDepartment are the involuntary players.''   The program was aimed at those who were considered to be holdingjobs sensitive enough to require drug testing. The department'sdefinition of sensitive positions included clerical assistants, mailand file clerks, auditors, cartographers and printing pressoperators.   Greene said such designation of routine job holders ``as beingall in sensitive positions is bureaucracy run amok.''   Greene said the government's goals ``do not justify a significantintrusion into an employee's privacy, particularly when there isabsolutely no showing that drug use exists that is impairing theroutine functions, let alone the critical responsibilities, of thedepartment.''   Greene said the program would deprive thousands of citizens offundamental privacy rights, ``not because anyone actually suspectsthat they are drug users, but because they are employees of thegovernment whom that government believes it can command on thataccount to repair to the toilets, so that it is able thereby todemonstrate its commitment to the war on drugs.''   The program had been envisioned by former Interior SecretaryDonald Hodel as a model for the government.   Greene did not enjoin the department from testing employees on``reasonable suspicion'' of drug use. And, the lawsuit did notaddress the department's recent policy requiring drug tests of jobapplicants, including secretary-designate Manuel Lujan Jr., who wasthe first tested under that policy.</TEXT></DOC>
