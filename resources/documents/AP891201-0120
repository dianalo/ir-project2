There were long lines of voters at polling booths and stateradio predicted a heavy turnout. Results were not expected untilsometime Sunday.   Voting appeared to be orderly but radio reports said severalpeople were injured Friday night in clashes at campaign-closingrallies in the industrial city of Kaohsiung.   There are 722 candidates running in the legislative, mayoral andcounty magistrate elections, which are seen as a major step inTaiwan's march toward democracy after four decades of rule by theNationalist Party.   It is an important test of the Democratic Progressive Party, themain opposition. The party was legalized in 1987 following the endof martial law, under which opposition parties were banned.   More than 75,000 police guarded about 10,000 polling stations toprevent sabotage and security forces readied barbed wire androadblocks in case of riots. Police have said they received tipsabout plans to disrupt the elections with bombs and the use ofchemicals to destroy ballots.   About 12 million ot Taiwan's 20 million citizens were eligibleto vote.   Opposition candidates have called for ``the downfall of theNationalist Party,'' which has ruled this island nation since itlost a civil war to Communist forces on the Chinese mainland in1949.   They accused the Nationalists of buying votes and other unfairtactics.   President Lee Teng-hui and his wife cast their ballots inTaipei. He told reporters, ``Don't forget to vote. The weather isnice so there will be a big turnout.''   Nationalist leader James Soong said losses for his party couldcause social unrest and damage the island's prosperous economy.``Our party has made reforms and brought welfare to the public,''he said.   The Nationalists cannot lose all power in the election. The256-seat Legislature and the electoral college are dominated byelderly Nationalists elected for life on the Chinese mainland inthe late 1940s to support the party's claim to be the legitimategovernment of all China.   The electoral college will choose a president next year.   In a last-minute move to win support from reform-minded voters,the Nationalists announced that 34 of the 162 elderly legislatorshad agreed to accept handsome pensions and will file for retirementsoon.   Few legislators took advantage of the retirement program when itwas announced in February by President Lee Teng-hui.   Opposition leader Kang said his party was handicapped during thecampaign by the Nationalist's domination of the island's economyand media.   Taiwan's three government TV stations initially gave almostexclusive coverage to Nationalist candidates but yielded underpressure from the public.   The opposition also says the Nationalists also have been helpedby an immense party machine that mobilized village chiefs and otherpoliticians to secure votes.   The Nationalists also have been accused of rampant vote buyingand violence, including sabotaging campaign offices and shooting anindependent candidate. The Nationalists denied the charges, butfinancial officials said cash in circulation jumped by $1.1 billionthe past week because of vote-buying.   ``We have but incomplete democracy,'' said Kang Ning-hsiang, theleader of the Democratic Progressive Party.   Although opposition candidates running as independents received22 percent of the vote in 1986 legislative elections, they only won12 seats.   The opposition is expected to win at least 30 percent of thepopular vote. But this year it has chosen to focus on localelections, especially the five mayorships and 17 county magistrateseats being contested.   The party believes that winning grass-roots power can help bringabout more local autonomy and build a stronger power base.   Most opposition candidates have focused on domestic problems,including pollution and official corruption.   The most contentious campaign issue was raised by 32 oppositioncandidates who formed an alliance to openly call for an``independent Taiwan.''   In a rejection of the Nationalist goal to one day rule over areunified China, the alliance called for ``a new country and newconstitution.''   Such a demand is seditious under the constitution and served asan indication of Taiwan's increasingly open political debate.   Many Taiwanese remain skeptical of the movement because ofCommunist China's threat to invade the island if it declaresindependence.</TEXT></DOC>
