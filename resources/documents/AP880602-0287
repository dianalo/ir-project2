Ross Perot for help in improving the nation'spostal service.   Perot, a pioneer in computer services, is expected to be askedto study the massive Postal Service and recommend ways to improveefficiency.   Frank, who became postmaster general March 1, reportedly firstmet Perot at about that time and began discussing the possibilityof having the Texan help improve postal efficiency.   Details of the plan, including the cost of Perot's work, werenot immediately available, but is was expected that Perot andassociates from his computer firm would undertake an analysis ofpostal operations, including automation and labor relations.   The Postal Service lost $635 million in the quarter fromDecember to March, but higher rates put into effect April 3 areexpected to pull the agency back into the black.   When it was made an independent agency in the early 1970s, thepostal subsidy was eliminated and the service was directed to breakeven, which it has done, on average, over the last decade.   Perot founded Electronic Data Systems Co., a pioneer computerservices company, and later worked to help restructure GeneralMotors Co., before clashing with GM chairman Roger B. Smith. Frankwas president of a California bank that became part of Ford MotorCo.</TEXT></DOC>
