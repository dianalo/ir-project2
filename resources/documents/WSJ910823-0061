But small businesses that havealready tested the waters of former Communist regimes inEastern Europe have a word of advice for them: Proceed withcaution.   As the nations of the former Soviet bloc abandoned Marxistorthodoxy for the free market, investment poured in.Companies from Western Europe, the U.S. and Japan set uphundreds of joint ventures in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakiaand Romania, as well as always independent-minded Yugoslavia.</LP><TEXT>   Though lagging far behind the Germans, Americans have madeor committed themselves to investments of more than $1billion in the region, with about $400 million coming fromthe federal government as seed money for joint-ventureprojects and an estimated $800 million or more from privatesources, mostly small and medium-sized companies.   The rush to Eastern Europe picked up momentum last year,analysts and financial experts say, but began showing signsof slowing this year. The chief reason was the foreigners'growing appreciation of the risks of getting involved in aneconomy battered by decades of Communist rule.   At the same time, larger companies are emboldened by therapid collapse of the coup against Soviet President MikhailGorbachev. Many are intensifying their plans for investmentin Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, with renewedconfidence that the hard-line obstacles to a free marketfinally have been toppled. Their deeper pockets also makethem less vulnerable to political volatility.   &quot;You can't invest funds there that you aren't prepared tolose,&quot; says Michael Claudon, president of the non-profitGeonomics Institute in Middlebury, Vt., which does researchon the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. &quot;It won't be businessas usual for a very long time. Entrepreneurs will have to beprepared {for} regular disruptions.&quot;   Guardian Industries Corp., a Northville, Mich.-based,manufacturer that specializes in flat glass put a $120million joint venture in Hungary into operation in February.It remains cautiously upbeat. &quot;The only kind of impact Imight foresee is on some of the supply,&quot; such as the woodimported from the Soviet Union to make crates for the glass,says Ralph Gerson, executive vice president at closely heldGuardian.   But doing business in Eastern Europe isn't for thefaint-hearted, Mr. Gerson cautions. The demand in Hungary forGuardian's products hasn't been as strong as originallyhoped, and the company has had to devise ways to work aroundcurrency problems -- such as bartering finished products forraw materials. &quot;Clearly it isn't a place for everyone,&quot; saysMr. Gerson. &quot;It is definitely a high-risk -- and hopefully,high-reward -- atmosphere.&quot;   Not everybody sees potential payoffs, though. Indeed, someentrepreneurs say finding riches in Eastern Europe has beenlike hunting for the elusive El Dorado, the legendary land ofgold sought by Spanish explorers in the New World.   &quot;It's thoroughly, thoroughly frustrating dealing withEastern Europe,&quot; laments Michael Slater, who is closing hisVentura, Calif., business that imported Christmas ornamentsand shoes from Poland and ceramic kitchenware fromCzechoslovakia. &quot;There's no sense of urgency, no sense ofpriority. I'm trying to give them business, yet they can'trespond to my requests as quickly as I'd like.&quot;   His Czechoslovak suppliers haven't provided him with thesample product he wanted even after six months of workingtogether, and his Polish suppliers, most of whom work out oftheir homes, have proved to be &quot;flaky,&quot; Mr. Slater says. &quot;Oneguy promised me 50,000 pieces by Aug. 1, which I ordered lastOctober, and I've only gotten 15,000,&quot; he says.   Trying to sell U.S. goods in Eastern Europe has beenequally nightmarish. Mr. Slater tried to peddle colorfulbaggy pants, popular with California bodybuilders, inCzechoslovakia and Poland for $6 a pop. &quot;I didn't sell onepair,&quot; he says. &quot;People wanted to buy them, but they couldn'tafford them.&quot; All told, Slater Import andamp; Trading Co. has sunkabout $100,000 into its ventures in Eastern Europe, he says.   The difficulties some entrepreneurs have encountered inthe former satellite nations has fueled a wariness toward theSoviet Union itself. The twists and turns of Soviet policyhave already sprung some unpleasant surprises, notablyMoscow's decision last year to demand hard currency for mostof its exports. Last week's coup attempt only highlighted theambiguities.   U.S. businesses &quot;are all terrified that there are going tobe major setbacks in Eastern Europe,&quot; says Thomas G. Rainey,executive director of the California Central Coast WorldTrade Center in Oxnard, Calif.   Robert Faris, head of the Polish-American Enterprise Fundin New York, which has committed over $95 million toinvestments in Poland, says the aftermath of the bungled coupcould disrupt deliveries of raw materials and complicatemarketing plans for companies in that country.   Moreover, the prospect of new upheavals -- includingethnic and regional conflicts -- as the Soviet Union adjuststo more liberal political and economic environment coulddampen the enthusiasm of investors who once saw EasternEurope as a springboard to the Soviet market, some analystssay.   For U.S. small businesses that rely on imports fromEastern Europe, the uncertain climate can also bedevastating, says Frank Eckel, president of Fe. InternationalInc., a Pittsburgh company with trading operations in theSoviet Union, Hungary and Yugoslavia.   Mr. Eckel has been purchasing special steel from a plantin the Yugoslav republic of Slovenia that still depends onthe Soviets to supply coke for its furnaces and buy itssteel. &quot;If they have problems dealing with the Soviet Union,we are affected too,&quot; Mr. Eckel complains.   Some small U.S. companies still plan to expand, of course.Chatsworth, Calif., entrepreneur Jerry Thompson, who recentlystarted a business exporting in-home water filters and herbalcosmetics to Czechoslovakia, says his Czechoslovak businessassociates were &quot;panic-stricken&quot; during the Soviet coup. &quot;Myfriends there remember the invasion of Prague in 1968,&quot; hesays.   Despite their nervousness, Mr. Thompson, who formed J.T.International Trading Co. a year and a half ago with aCzechoslovak partner, hopes to branch out by establishing thecountry's first private distribution company and a businesstraining center &quot;to teach grass-roots entrepreneurship&quot; tothe Czechoslovaks.   &quot;They want this connection with Americans,&quot; he says.
