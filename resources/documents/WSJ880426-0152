Shortly before the mid-May departure of the first of 115,000 Soviet soldiers, he wants the two countries to celebrate the 40th anniversary of their relations with cultural agreements or perhaps an exchange of senior officials -- including, it is hoped, Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. &quot;The two countries are at pains to see how we should celebrate this event as a first step toward improving our relations,&quot; President Zia said in an interview at his Islamabad home, shrugging off previous suggestions he has made that Moscow has been behind a series of crossborder raids and terrorist attacks that have killed hundreds.    One of the more ironic likely outcomes of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan is that Pakistan's relations with the U.S. will cool while some of its ties to Moscow will improve. The change will be subtle. Moscow's ties remain deep to Pakistan's nemesis, India, and the U.S. will try to maintain its interests in Pakistan.    For years, Pakistan has been the conduit for billions of dollars of U.S. and Chinese arms for the Moslem guerrillas fighting the Soviets in neighboring Afghanistan. During that period of U.S.-Pakistani cooperation, Washington's objections to Pakistan's efforts to develop nuclear weapons have been swept under the rug.    But now that the Afghanistan conflict appears headed toward a settlement, congressmen such as Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.) say they are more likely to question U.S. aid programs. U.S. budgetary constraints could further endanger the country's standing as the third-largest recipient of American assistance, following Israel and Egypt.    Pakistan has a long history of trade with Moscow, which it would like to jumpstart. Getting on the right side of Mr. Gorbachev's global diplomatic offensive could also help neutralize what Pakistan officials consider Soviet designs to destabilize their country. It could also give Pakistan leverage in dealing with the U.S. and could even lead to reduced tensions with India.    &quot;The geopolitical equation changes immediately after Soviet troops are withdrawn {from Afghanistan},&quot; said Syed Fakhar Imam, former speaker of the National Assembly. &quot;U.S.-Pakistani relations won't get the same priority in Washington. We have also seen our neighbors China and Iran improve relations with the Soviets, and we don't want to be left behind.&quot;    President Zia is confident the U.S. won't repeat what he calls its error in 1978, when the Carter administration cut off aid, one year ahead of the Soviet invasion, in response to Pakistan's refusal to abide by nuclear safeguards. Pakistani officials say the Afghan war should have increased Washington's appreciation of Pakistan as a close friend.    &quot;The withdrawal of Soviet forces doesn't change the reality of American interests,&quot; said former Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, who was instrumental in earlier U.S. efforts to improve relations with China. &quot;It would be a great mistake to scale down what you have built up in Pakistan.&quot;    Yet President Zia expressed worry about the whimsical nature of U.S.-Pakistan relations. &quot;I have great regard for the United States of America, but like many of the United States' friends, I also say that the United States of America has no permanent or future-oriented foreign policy. . .you tend to take a very short view,&quot; he said.    Pakistani officials hope Congress will recognize the futility of an aid cutoff. The U.S. can't reverse Pakistan's uranium-enrichment capability, they argue, and U.S. aid is the main disincentive to building a nuclear weapon. &quot;By cutting off aid, you wouldn't gain in your efforts against nuclear proliferation and you would lose strategic interests,&quot; said Mr. Yaqub Khan. &quot;It is a self-defeating policy.&quot;    Added President Zia: &quot;Perhaps the {U.S.} effort was to stop us from that enrichment program. Having seen that Pakistan has gone and succeeded, the best thing now is to enjoy and relax.&quot; He insisted that Pakistan doesn't have a nuclear weapon or a program to build one. Whatever happens to Pakistan-U.S. relations, President Zia expects closer ties to the Soviets as a result of what he calls Mr. Gorbachev's intention to reduce tensions with the U.S. and its allies.    &quot;Why has the Soviet Union withdrawn?&quot; he asked. &quot;Is it because the mujahideen {Afghan resistance} have given it a bloody nose? That could be a contributing factor. Did the Soviet Union withdraw because it could not sustain economically 150,000 troops. No. . . . it is the global approach of Mr. Gorbachev as the leader of the Soviet Union that he wants to concentrate his efforts on different fields rather than wasting his bloody time on Afghanistan.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
