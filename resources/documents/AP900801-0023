And thistime he won't have radar to help guide him.   Bush was enveloped in a thick fog, the real kind, early lastSunday when he went out for an early-morning spin in his speedboatin the Atlantic and soon lost sight of land.   A small orange Coast Guard boat laden with radar and othersophisticated navigation equipment helped to escort the presidentand his briefly disoriented Secret Service escorts back to safety.   Aghast at fast-growing rumors _ fed by confusing radio trafficoverheard by local boaters _ that the president had beentemporarily lost at sea, the White House quickly issued a statementasserting that the chief executive had never been in danger. Norlost.   But navigating the political waters without losing his way islikely to be even more challenging.   With traditional Republican rallying beacons blurred byinternational and fiscal realities, Bush may find himself wanderingaround the country in September and October praising Democraticleaders, backing new taxes and defending cuts in defense spending.   That's not exactly the kind of red-meat rhetoric that inspiresRepublicans to jump to their feet and open their wallets.   But much has happened since Bush in 1988 told audiences ``readmy lips _ no new taxes,'' asserted that the Cold War still ragedand called for maintaining the defense buildup of the Reagan years.   Faced with an annual budget deficit of $169 billion, thepresident abandoned his campaign vow against new taxes andinitiated a search for a bipartisan package of $50 billion in newtaxes and spending cuts. But in so doing, he immediately lost theRepublicans' favorite perennial issue _ portraying Democrats as theparty of higher taxes.   Bush even toned down his GOP speeches last week after Democratscomplained that they were too partisan and threatened to undermineyet-to-materialize progress in budget talks.   He even started praising a onetime nemesis, House MajorityLeader Richard Gephardt, for the Missouri Democrat's role in thebudget negotiations.   The dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the crumbling of theSoviet empire have taken away defense spending as a key 1990 issue.   Even as Bush toured an MX missile site in Wyoming and praisednuclear readiness, his own Pentagon was charting a wide array ofdefense cuts.   Bush also will likely steer away from the emotional abortionissue _ even though he mentioned his own anti-abortion stancefrequently in 1988.   The less he says about the subject the better it will be forconfirmation chances of his Supreme Court nominee, David Souter,whose lack of a record on abortion may be his biggest selling point.   Furthermore, Republican strategists are mindful of the drubbingthat anti-abortion GOP candidates took in gubernatorial races lastyear in New Jersey and Virginia.   The savings and loan crisis _ which touches both Democrats andRepublicans _ is certainly a no-win issue for the president ifthere ever was one, particularly in light of the role of his sonNeil in the collapse of a Denver Sandamp;L.   So what's left for Bush to talk about?   Well, for one thing _ there's TV actress Roseanne Barr'sshrieking rendition of the national anthem last week in San Diego.   ``My reaction is, it was disgraceful,'' Bush declared.   And there's always broccoli. He told a GOP audience inPhiladelphia last week that he wasn't about to change hisopposition to the dreaded green vegetable.   Bush hasn't done much to lift the political fog.   ``We all know that the Democrats have a long track record onspending,'' he told a Republican gathering. ``But if the BerlinWall could come down in the same year that America goes nuts overthe Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles, who knows who could happennext?''   Actually, Bush may end up reconsidering his decision to spendalmost all September and much of October on the campaign trail.   Efforts to reach a bipartisan budget accord will go intohigh-gear in September, given the near-certainty that one won't beforged before the August congressional recess.   Bush may find himself out talking about Ninja Turtles andbroccoli to less-than-enthusiastic audiences as major defense cutsand new taxes are being decided back in Washington.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Tom Raum covers the White House for TheAssociated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
