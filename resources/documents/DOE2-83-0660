The projectis a follow-up of the Nordic Industry Fund project which was completedin 1983. Smaller test ovens with IR long waves, warm air convection andmicrowaves of 2,47 GHz were used. Measurements of heat distribution fromall three energy sources have been made. Extensive experiments have beencarried out in order to develope baking methods for white loaves whichare energy saving, but where the quality of the bread does not undergoany form of deterioration. Tests were made using microwaves alone, andin combination with hot air and IR. A resulting saving 35% baking timewas achieved, and a further reduction of baking time can be reached wherea greater improvement of energy distribution can take place, especiallyin the case of microwaves and IR.
