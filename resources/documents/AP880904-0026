Court begins Monday for Yuri Churbanov, a former first deputyinterior minister who once moved in the top levels of Kremlinsociety. If found guilty of bribe-taking and abuse of office, heand eight co-defendants could be executed by firing squad.   Their trial, and the extraordinary publicity given itsinvestigatory phase, are in line with Communist Party chief MikhailS. Gorbachev's drive to break with the cronyism, corruption andnepotism now seen as endemic under Brezhnev. Brezhnev ruled theSoviet Union from 1964 until his death in 1982.   The court case, to be heard by the Military Collegium of theSoviet Supreme Court, may also have a political aim _ to signal theKremlin Old Guard who flourished under Brezhnev that their time haspassed and that continued resistance to Gorbachev-era reforms mustcease.   Churbanov, who married Brezhnev's daughter Galina in 1971 afterdivorcing his first wife in 1964, is a central figure in anembezzlement and bribery scheme authorities say centered on theCentral Asian republic of Uzbekistan.   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said that beginning in the1970s, cotton harvests in Uzbekistan were padded by almost 1million tons annually, and Moscow was made to pay for thenon-existent crop by corrupt officials all the way up to longtimeUzbek party boss Sharaf Rashidov, who died in 1983.   ``Today it has been proven that the cotton barons stole morethan 4 billion rubles ($6.34 billion) from the state, half of whichthey stuffed into their own pockets,'' Pravda said this year in asensational expose on the fraud, whose scale is without Sovietprecedent.   Churbanov, 51, who held the rank of colonel general in theMoscow-based ministry responsible for police and law enforcementnationwide, was a power-hungry epicure who helped shield theracket, Soviet press accounts say.   ``The son-in-law became the `first violin' at the end of the70s,'' Pravda said last week. ``Having such a `friend' was not onlyan advantage for Rashidov and his group _ it was vitallyimportant.''   Churbanov, who worked as a mechanic before taking a low-levelInterior Ministry job in 1961, is accused of accepting bribestotaling 651,888 rubles, the equivalent of $1.1 million.   That sum, stupendous by Soviet standards, is equivalent to 270years' pay for the average Soviet factory worker.   The weekly Moscow News cited this encounter between Churbanov,then deputy interior minister, and Abduvakhid Karimov, thenCommunist Party boss in Uzbekistan's Bukhara region:   ``When an earthquake struck the town of Gazli ... Churbanov cameto inspect relief efforts. `There aren't any cigarettes in thestores,' he berated Karimov on the street. At his dacha thatevening, Karimov gave Churbanov 10,000 rubles ($15,800) in exchangefor the latter's promise `not to report shortcomings to hissuperiors.'''   Karimov was sentenced to death for bribery by the Soviet SupremeCourt in June 1987 after an anti-corruption drive in Uzbekistanthat led to the replacement of two-thirds of all party-appointedofficials.   Officials announced Churbanov's arrest in February 1987. He wasfired from his top-level Interior Ministry job in 1984, butreportedly was employed as deputy chief of political administrationfor the ministry's uniformed security troops until September 1986.   Along with Churbanov, currently in KGB custody, eight formerUzbekistan officials will go on trial: Interior Minister KhaidarYakhyaev, two of his deputies and five regional police chiefs.   The evidence against the nine men fills 110 volumes, and fivevolumes were needed to spell out the indictment. A total of 501witnesses are mentioned in the indictment.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told reporters lastweek the trial is expected to last up to two months. Churbanov maybe given the death penalty if convicted, Gerasimov said, because heis charged with serious economic crimes.   Churbanov's attorney, Andrei Makarov of Moscow, said in aninterview published last week that his client is being made ascapegoat for the ills of the Brezhnev era.   Makarov told the Moscow News: ``The impression is that Churbanovis being blamed for everything negative that we used to have, orthat Brezhnev is being tried under the name of Churbanov.''   Pravda, however, called Churbanov ``an example of the`stagnation period,' when a person reached high position notbecause of his merits but due to his family connections.''   It added: ``Glasnost and democracy will help to avoidChurbanovism and anything similar to it.''</TEXT></DOC>
