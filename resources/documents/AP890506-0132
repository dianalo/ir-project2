The remarks by Dr. David Owen, head of the Social DemocraticParty, follow the socialist Labor Party's upset victory over theConservatives in a special parliamentary election.   He said in an interview with a Labor magazine, ``Enterprise ofLabor,'' that he would have ``no problems'' serving under Laborleader Neil Kinnock in a coalition as long as some policies werechanged, the domestic Press Association agency reported.   The Independent newspaper also carried excerpts from theinterview, which quoted Owen as saying Kinnock had done a``remarkable job'' leading the party.   But Kinnock's office issued a short rebuff, saying: ``No pacts.No deals.'' Owen split with the main body of Social DemocraticParty members last year when they merged with the Liberal Party tobecome the Social and Liberal Democratic Party.   The Social and Liberal Democrats have 19 legislators in the650-member House of Commons, while the Social Democrats have three,compared with the Conservative Party's 374 and Labor's 228.   In Thursday's parliamentary election, Labor won a seat in theVale of Glamoran that the Conservatives held for 38 years.</TEXT></DOC>
