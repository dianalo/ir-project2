A U.S. District Court jury found Woods guilty of 17 of 22counts, including two counts of conspiracy, seven counts ofextortion, one count of racketeering, five counts of income taxevasion and two counts of filing false tax returns.   Woods was accused of taking $19,600 in payments from businesmanMichael Hartman to help the contractor get city housing contractsand expedite payments on a project Hartman had before the cityHousing Authority.   Prosecutors also alleged that Woods accepted $36,727 from JosephWozniak, a former Westmoreland County businessman. In return, theysaid, Woods used his influence to help Wozniak sell concretesealants to several city agencies.   During testimony in his own defense, Woods said he receivedcommissions of 5 percent or 10 percent, depending on how muchsealer Wozniak sold.   Hartman, 38, of Pleasant Hills was convicted of one count eachof conspiracy, racketeering and filing false corporate tax returns.Hartman's Ablebuilt Construction Co. was convicted of a singlecount of racketeering.   Judge Alan N. Bloch dismissed four counts of extortion againstWoods and one count of filing a false 1984 corporate tax returnagainst Hartman because the jury could not reach a unanimousverdict on those counts.   The jury also found Woods innocent of one count of extortion.   The panel will reconvene Tuesday to hear additional testimony inorder to decide how much of the profits the three defendants mustforfeit. Under the federal Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act, they could be required to forfeit up to threetimes what they received as a result of their illegal activity.   The defendants face a maximum of three years in jail on each ofthe counts of filing false tax returns, five years for each of theconspiracy and tax evasion counts and a maximum of 20 years foreach of the racketeering and extortion counts.   Wozniak, a government witness, was granted immunity fromprosecution.   Woods, 47, was elected acting council president when SophieMasloff left the post. She became mayor in May 1988 when MayorRichard Caliguiri died.   Woods opened Monday's council meeting and led a silent prayer,then announced his resignation, effective immediately.   ``For the past eight years, I have always attempted to representthis great and proud city in a manner in which I felt to beconsistent with its best interests,'' Woods said. ``Now, however,with the serious and important business of budget deliberationsabout to begin, the nagging and persistent controversy still beingplayed out threatens to interfere with and diminish the attentionthat the budget process deserves.''</TEXT></DOC>
