Most of the citations issued to the Budd Co. by the department'sOccupational Safety and Health Administration alleged violationseither of noise- and hearing-related standards or requirements thatemployers keep detailed records of workplace injuries.   Of the 840 citations, 834 were for alleged willful violations ofsafety standards _ meaning that OSHA believes the company knew ofviolations or hazardous conditions but made no meaningful effort tocorrect them.   Nearly 500 of the alleged willful violations dealt withnoise-related standards, including 124 instances in which OSHA saidcompany-administered tests showed employees' hearing haddeteriorated but the company did not inform the workers.   Budd, which makes doors, lift gates and other sheet-metalproducts for automobiles, has 15 working days to contest thecitations and fine _ the fifth largest proposed by OSHA.   The company said in a statement that it was committed to workersafety, had hired a consultant to assess noise exposure and hadrevised its medical record-keeping.   However, the company said it could not reply in detail to thecitations because its officials had not had time to review them.   ``The plant, like OSHA, is deeply concerned about any situationwhich may pose a threat to the safety of its employees and thecompany will do everything appropriate to ensure that its employeescontinue to work in the safest environment possible,'' the companysaid from its Troy, Mich., corporate office.   Budd said about 2,400 people work at the Philadelphia plant,which was inspected by OSHA beginning in June after an employeecomplaint.   ``Hearing loss is one of the most debilitating hazards found inthis type of workplace, and systematic deficiencies in virtuallyall aspects of this company's hearing conservation program toprotect workers against such loss were identified,'' LaborSecretary Elizabeth Dole said in a statement.   Assistant Labor Secretary Gerard F. Scannell, who heads OSHA,said tests indicated that noise levels in an area where 150 pressoperators work were above government limits.   Citations against the company included allegations of failure toadminister annual audiogram tests; failure to compare annualhearing test results with baseline hearing levels or failure tohave physicians review problem cases; willful violations ofrecord-keeping regulations; and inadequate noise monitoring.   The largest fine proposed by OSHA was $7.3 million, leviedearlier this year against USX Corp for alleged safety violations.That case is pending.</TEXT></DOC>
