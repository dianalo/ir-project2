There was a leftist government in Nicaragua, a strongMarxist-led insurgency in El Salvador and a simmering guerrilla warin Guatemala. Calm prevailed in Honduras, Panama, and Costa Rica _all longtime American allies.   Today, the Sandinista government in Nicaragua remains in power.The civil war is intensifying in El Salvador, and Guatemalan troopsattempted a coup last week. Hondurans attacked a U.S. governmentoffice last month.   Relations with Panama are at an all-time low. Even Costa Rica'susual tranquility has been disrupted.   A series of American administrations paid little attention tothe small republics run by military officers or small, economicallypowerful groups. In the late 1970s, Central America suddenly tookcenter stage.   What happened?   Here is a look at the situation in each country:</TEXT><HEAD>Nicaragua</HEAD><TEXT>   The 1978-79 war waged by the Sandinistas against then PresidentAnastasio Somoza returned Central America to the spotlight. It wascapped by the Sandinistas' triumphant march into Managua on July19, 1979, to end more than four decades of power by the rightist,pro-American Somoza dynasty.   Less than two years later, the CIA, claiming the Sandinistaswere hardened Marxists exporting revolution to El Salvador, begantraining and supplying a group of rebels known today as the Contras.   The 1981 cutoff of U.S. aid and the 1985 trade embargo failed tobring the Sandinista government to its knees. Millions of dollars _some covert and some congressionally approved _ were provided tothe Contras. Yet they were unable to defeat the Soviet-suppliedSandinistas.   Pushed by last summer's regional peace plan, the Sandinistassigned a historic cease-fire pact with the Contra leadership onMarch 23. A fragile truce remains in place, but the two sides canagree on little else than a desire to the war that has claimed50,000 dead and wounded.</TEXT><HEAD>Panama</HEAD><TEXT>   The strongest efforts yet to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,chief of the Defense Forces of Panama and the nation's de factoleader, are approaching their first anniversary.   Noriega was indicted in February by two federal grand juries inFlorida on drug-trafficking charges.   After the indictment, the Reagan administration pushed harderfor Noriega's ouster and imposed economic sanctions. Noriega washolding firm, although an internal opposition continues pressingfor his departure, and there are reports from Washington of apossible negotiated solution.</TEXT><HEAD>El Salvador</HEAD><TEXT>   The United States gave little attention to the smallest of theCentral American nations until 1980, when it appeared thatMarxist-led guerrillas who began fighting a year earlier couldtopple the government. Rightists struck out with vengeance,slaughtering suspected leftists and dumping their bodies in SanSalvador streets.   The United States has buoyed the government with more than $3billion to date, more than any other nation in the region.Congress, haunted by the memory of Vietnam, agreed in 1981 to sendAmerican troops to train the unskilled Salvadoran military. But alimit of 55 soldiers remains in effect.   The war continues in the countryside. Human rights groups claimmore than 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed.   The political parties are sharply divided. President JoseNapoleon Duarte's Christian Democratic Party, backed by the UnitedStates, suffered a humiliating defeat in March legislative andmunicipal elections at the hands of the rightist RepublicanNationalist Alliance, known as Arena.</TEXT><HEAD>Guatemala</HEAD><TEXT>   The military government has been fighting a stubborn guerrillamovement for decades. The Guatemalan army has boasted that its``scorched earth'' tactics, aimed at Indian villages in thenorthwest highlands, curbed the insurgency. Nonetheless, 27 yearslater the rebels continue to fight.   On Wednesday, the Defense Ministry announced it quashed anuprising and arrested two officers who led it. The developmentsraised doubts again about the stability of the return to civilianrule in Guatemala under President Vinicio Cerezo, who is almostmidway through his five-year term.</TEXT><HEAD>Honduras</HEAD><TEXT>   This nation became the cornerstone of Reagan's Central Americanpolicy. Acquiescing to the United States, Honduras allowed itsterritory to be used by American troops and for Contra base camps.   The Americans during military exercises built roads andairports, all of which could serve as a beachhead for an invasionof Nicaragua.   Two events, starting in March, sparked protests in the normallytranquil nation. Reagan sent 3,200 American soldiers to Hondurasduring the latest border incursion by the Sandinistas, who werehunting for Contras. In early April, a Honduran citizen was whiskedaway to the United States to face drug trafficking charges,although the Honduran constitution bars extradition.   About 2,000 protesters enraged by the extradition burned theU.S. Consulate and U.S. Information Service offices. The governmentimposed a weeklong state of emergency to quell the violence.</TEXT><HEAD>Costa Rica</HEAD><TEXT>   Long considered the region's democratic showcase, Costa Ricamaintains its neutrality and serves as a leader in the effort topromote peace. President Oscar Arias won last year's Nobel PeacePrize for writing the plan signed last August by the presidents ofNicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.   Nonetheless, Costa Rica has not been immune from the violence.Last month, a fragmentation grenade exploded near the U.S.-CostaRica Cultural Center in the capital of San Jose, wounding fivepeople, including two American citizens.</TEXT></DOC>
