(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>EARLY ADOPTERS REPORT ARCHITECTURE HAS PLUSESandM;In the film Star Wars, Luke Skywalker had all the advantages of client/servercomputing.andP;  His servers, R2D2 and C3PO, were there when he needed them.andP;  Withthem around to keep him out of trouble, Luke could concentrate on the waragainst Darth Vader.andP;  He did not have to know how R2D2 and C3PO worked, orhow to make them communicate with each other.andP;  They took care of thatthemselves.andP;  And none of the wires were showing.andM;But that was the future.andP;  This is 1990--the year that the first significantsteps toward client/server computing are taking place.andP;  Dropping workstationcosts, more powerful processors and new software capabilities are bringingnew opportunities to the desktop, via client/server computing.andM;The driving force behind the move is the applications.andP;  Customers areidentifying applications that put a lot more data on the screen.andP;  Theseapplications call for bit-mapped terminals with graphical user interfaces anddatabase managers to handle the data.andM;A look at the early adopters of client/server computing reveals that thetechnology is, indeed, taking hold.andP;  Moreover, the evidence suggestsclient/server computing is making good on promises.andP;  Client/server systemsare not only creating significant benefits by off-loading processing to lessexpensive platforms, but they are also demonstrating greater responsivenessto user needs.andM;In fact, some corporations, while admitting they have implementedclient/server applications, were reluctant to divulge details because theyare using these applications to gain competitive advantage in their markets.andM;Client/server architecture is expected to be in full bloom within the nextfive years.andP;  But while there are compelling business reasons to implementclient/server applications, the tools for building these applications, aswell as connectivity and control issues, are just now being worked out.andO;There are still a few wires showing.andM;Client/server computing first took the form of shared printers, file serversand electronic mail on LANs.andP;  As technology has progressed, so hasclient/server.andP;  At the client end, user interface technology has advanceddramatically.andP;  At the server end, we now have databases, knowledge andinference servers, as well as attachable processing resources.andM;Classical mainframe applications have used dumb terminals for years to movedata between the user and the database, treating the application as amonolith.andP;  Client/server computing separates an application into threepieces: the presentation layer (or the user interface), the application logicand the server (database, mail, fax, etc.).andP;  By separating an applicationinto these layers, the best technology for each can be chosen.andM;Client/server computing takes advantage of advances in user interfacetechnology, relational database capabilities and network connectivity.andO;Client/server applications present a single image to the user--regardless ofthe complexities under the hood.andM;But client/server computing is more than just a new face on an oldapplication, or a shared database behind a personal computer.andP;  It is a newway of thinking about the way we use information technology.andM;&quot;When I meet with a client to discuss implementing client/serverarchitecture, I first ask what the business opportunities are,&quot; said Dr.andO;Robert S. Epstein, executive vice president of Sybase, Emeryville, Calif.andO;&quot;We're there to solve business problems.andP;  No one moves to a new technologyunless they are solving a compelling business problem with that technology.&quot;andM;Epstein finds two driving business reasons, both tied to gaining competitiveadvantage: adding value to a product or service using information technology,and reducing the time to market for products and services.andM;REDUCED TRAINING TIMEandM;One example of the business benefits of client/server computing is the use ofimproved user interfaces to reduce training and support costs.andP;  This can beseen in how AMR Travel of Carrollton, Texas, is using InFront/DS from MultiSoft, Inc., Lawrenceville, N.J.andM;Multi Soft offers a fourth-generation language for developing client servicesin front of existing CICS applications.andP;  The company's InFront/DS developmentsystem includes a screen management system, a programming language and alocal database.andM;Customers use these products to improve the user interface and performediting on the workstation, according to Ross Altman, Multi Soft's vicepresident of marketing.andP;  This dramatically reduces the learning curve at theworkstation, he said.andM;Multi Soft also offers EasySAA, whic expedites development of CUA (CommonUser Access)-compatible interfaces to existing applications.andM;Doug Brown, director of technical services for AMR Travel, used Multi Soft'stools to develop a user interface for a sales and marketing system, whilekeeping the data on the mainframe database.andP;  At the client side are networkedIBM PS/2s, with an IBM MPA board providing a gateway to the host.andP;  Twoservers, both IDMS databases, are available: the reservations database, andthe sales and marketing database.andM;With the personal computer interface, users can pick codes from pop-up list,reducing the learning curve.andP;  &quot;With the editing at the workstation, we have amuch better ability to edit data, since the personal computer lets us editeach field as it is entered,&quot; Brown said.andM;AMR's system runs on MS-DOS, with extended memory.andP;  Brown said he is contentwith the DOS configuration and sees no compelling business reason to go toOS/2 at this time.andP;  &quot;Even though there are some nice OS/2 applicationsavailable, our users need to be able to mix DOS and OS/2 applications.&quot;andM;Another company that reduced training time using client/server computing isMarine Midland Bank of New York.andP;  Ken Dubensky, vice president, said, &quot;Itused to take a commercial loan person six months to become productive.andP;  Byadding a new front end to a system that's 15 or 20 years old, we expect toreduce that time to two months.&quot;andM;Dubensky used Easel from Interactive Images, Woburn, Mass.andP;  Easel supportsdevelopment of the user interface, as well as a C language programmingenvironment installed at Marine Midland.andP;  The new user interface collectsdata for the mainframe-based commercial loan system and two local dBasedatabases the bank developed in recent years.andP;  Since all the data iscollected in a single-user session, consistency is guaranteed.andM;Based on the results he is seeing with the commercial load system, Dubenskyexpects the bank to broaden its use of client/server applications.andM;CHANGES IN USERSandM;Aspen Research, Inc. of Burlingame, Calif., also offers a fourth-generationlanguage for developing client services.andP;  Aspen designed its product, Mozart,so its customers could quickly and easily upgrade the look and feel ofexisting mainframe applications--without rewriting any code.andP;  According toAlan Parnass, president and founder, &quot;Because of the high costs and risks, itis unlikely that mainframe applications will be replaced.andP;  MIS is simply toobusy adding functionality to go back and rearchitect.&quot;andM;Parnass also sees a change in the nature of the user.andP;  &quot;We are moving fromthe data-entry user to the professional transaction worker, a level above thesee-and-key types.&quot;andP;  Mozart offers an evolutionary approach, according toParnass.andP;  &quot;Professional workers gain direct access to mainframe applications,but they can operate them without formal training.&quot;andM;One user of Mozart is Immanuel Medical Center in Omaha, Neb.andP;  &quot;Or physiciansneeded online access to patient information, but they resisted the log-onprocess and input screens of the online system,&quot; said Dan Connolly, systemsand programming manager for the medical center.andM;&quot;With Mozart, we were able to create a new front end.andP;  Now they use a barcode scanner to enter their code.andP;  The system responds with a display of thepatient list and a laser-printed report.andP;  They don't even have to tough thekeyboard,&quot; Connolly said.andM;Another feature of Mozart is its support for up to four concurrent sessionsacross IBM and DEC processors.andP;  Mozart supports a character mode userinterface within DOS' 640K limit.andP;  The extended memory version supports agraphical user interface.andP;  The OS/2 version will support PresentationManager.andM;OFF-LOADING DEVELOPMENT TO PCsandM;Micro Focus, Palo Alto, Calif., offers the Cobol/2 Workbench and other PCworkstation software tools that can be used to off-load development ofapplications to the personal computer.andP;  Micro Focus' argument in favor ofCobol is that the language is widely used and is portable to a number ofplatforms.andP;  Applications built with these tools can be run on the mainframe,on a LAN or as client/server applications.andM;According to Karl Kramme, product manager, Cobol/2 Workbench includes aDiaglog System which is a runtime controller of the user interface.andP;  Itincludes tools for generating a character-based interface.andP;  Preprocessors areavailable for using third-party database tools, such as XDB from XDB Systems,College Park, Md., and SQLBase from Gupta Technologies, Inc., Menlo Park,Calif., for developing DB2 applications.andM;Micro Focus also offers a development environment for running CICS underOS/2.andP;  Support for OS/2 Extended Edition, including its Data Manager databasecomponent, is built into the compiler, according to Peter Katz, technicalmarketing manager.andM;Barbara Bouldin, manager of third-party relations for Micro Focus, said, &quot;Thetechnology is here now, but an attitude of pioneering still exists.andP;  Thetools are still in the hands of the architects and designers.andP;  The next stepis broad-based use.&quot;andM;From a performance standpoint, client/server architecture allows traffic tobe off-loaded from the transaction processing network.andP;  For example, AmericanAirlines, Fort Worth, Texas, has moved its yield management application,called Interactive Dinamo, to a local area network.andP;  &quot;With OS/2'smultitasking, our users can work in one part of the screen while a report isbeing developed in another window,&quot; said Kennon Grose, acting manager, newtechnology systems planning/development.andM;The yield management system provides critical information to flight analystswho try to ensure that every flight leaves the gate filled to capacity, andwith the highest fare that the market will hold paid by the passengers.andP;  Atthe same time, the analyst tries to avoid overbooking.andP;  American Airlinesclaims it has the lowest rate of denied boarding of all U.S.andP;  carriers, andit credits the yield management system for that success.andM;&quot;We standardized on OS/2 and Presentation Manager over a year ago,&quot; Grosesaid.andP;  &quot;We have six mission-critical applications in production or indevelopment on the platform.&quot;andM;Some of the more advanced work introduces knowledge in the form of inferenceinto the application.andP;  American's QMAX is an application that handles bookingrequests for large parties.andP;  QMAX includes rules that apply by class oftraveler.andM;American Airlines uses the SQL Server engine developed by Sybase to manage a1.2G-byte database on the local area network.andP;  Although early applicationswere coded using Presentation Manager and C, American has begun to useChoreographer from GUIdance Technologies, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa., to develop auser interface.andP;  Choreographer is an object-oriented environment for buildinggraphical user interfaces.andM;&quot;The first screens pay the cost of building the library of reusable objects,but once these are in place, additional screens can be developed veryquickly,&quot; according to Ken Harkness, president of GUIdance Technologies.andM;Grose agreed: &quot;With Choreographer, we can develop rapid prototypes.andP;  If wewant to replace Choreographer code with C for performance, we can easily dothat.&quot;andM;However, Sybase's Epstein said that true client/server applications require anew way of thinking about applications, which is more than just putting a newuser interface on an existing application.andM;One of Sybase's customers is building a client/server application to selltickets to sporting and entertainment events.andP;  The application tells the userwhat seats are available, then reserves the seats, calls Visa to charge theticket and then prints the ticket.andP;  Many of Epstein's customers, like thisone, invoke multiple servers from a single client interaction.andM;Epstein expects the reusability of servers, such as the Visa server in theexample above, to reduce the time needed to build applications, reducing timeto market for service industries like banking.andP;  &quot;Imagine the advantage afinancial institution would have if it could quickly introduce a newfinancial instrument to the market,&quot; noted Epstein.andM;Client/server computing also enables a new class of applications.andP;  AnalystEsther Dyson, who is also publisher and editor of the newsletter Release 1.0,New York, has popularized the term &quot;groupware&quot; for software that allowsgroups to collaborate toward a work product.andM;An example of such an application is Lotus Notes from Lotus DevelopmentCorp., Cambridge, Mass., which came to market with a great deal of attention.andO;Originally previewed at Dyson's 1988 PC Forum, Notes provides an environmentfor sharing text and graphic information, developed internally or gatheredform external sources.andP;  Notes also advances the support for collaborativework by allowing for information sharing within and across LANs.andM;One user of Notes is Price Waterhouse of New York.andP;  According to SheldonLaube, national director of information and technology, Price Waterhouse waslooking for a way to manage its expertise.andP;  &quot;As consultants, that's our stockand trade,&quot; Laube said.andP;  Price Waterhouse communicates through phone calls,faxes and Federal Express.andP;  Laube was looking at E-mail packages when he cameacross Notes.andM;&quot;With Notes, we see an opportunity to let our professionals collaborate on aglobal basis,&quot; he said.andP;  Price Waterhouse has introduced Notes to supportseveral of its internal groups, and will eventually install 10,000 copies ofthe product.andM;The system manages forms and databases that have been imported.andP;  Users canbrowse for material, attach comments and route information to others.andO;&quot;People think it's terrific,&quot; Laube said.andP;  &quot;It looks like any Windowsapplication.andP;  Our people find it easy to use and they quickly findapplications for it.&quot;andM;One application they use is the Reuters News Fed.andP;  As the news feed isreceived, Notes performs a keyword search and categorization, so that userscan quickly find news of particular interest.andM;Laube feels that Lotus Notes justifies the cost of the dedicated OS/2 server,the client workstations (which were already in place) and the software, whichis priced at $62,500.andP;  &quot;It will help us to serve our clients better by givingour professionals better access to our professional information.andP;  We expectto gain a major competitive advantage by using Notes.&quot;andM;A large number of client/server applications will be built as businessapplications rather than installed as shrink-wrap software.andP;  In fact, Notesis really a programmable platform for group interaction, with forms, rules,triggers and mailboxes.andP;  According to Jim Manzi, president of Lotus, &quot;Notesmay be more of a service than a product,&quot; because the applications built onNotes will give it its value.andM;THE STANDARDS ISSUEandM;While the benefits of these client/server computing projects are clear,making the move to client/server is still a technical challenge.andO;Client/server applications often require that components from differentvendors interoperate.andP;  This brings the standards issue to the front lines.andM;Advocates of open computing architectures argue that there should beagreement on standards so that processors, applications and databases can beintermixed on the network, as called for by the application.andP;  To do this, thefollowing standards would need to be agreed upon:andM;* Data must be accessible in a common language that does not requireknowledge of how or where it is maintained.andM;* Different operating systems need to be able to work together to accomplishwork.andM;* The network that ties these processors together should be hidden behind theuser interface.andM;When it comes to standards, however, companies don't just run toward eachother in slow motion with open arms like lovers in a Fellini movie.andM;The one standard that appears to have been settled upon is SQL.andP;  But,according to Umang Gupta, president of Gupta Technologies, Inc., of MenloPark, Calif., &quot;SQL is not SQL is not SQL.andP;  SQL syntax capability is fairlywell understood--the problem is not the snytax, but the API [applicationprogram interface].&quot;andP;  Without a common interface at the application level,programs that access DB2, for example, would need to be changed to readOracle, for example.andM;Underlying the syntax is a mix of functionality.andP;  &quot;Two-way browsing, aninherent requirement in a graphical user interface, is not currentlyavailable in DB2,&quot; Gupta said.andP;  So to hook up technologies without losing anyof their advantages, Gupta has introduced SQL Windows, an applicationdevelopment tool that hides environmental differences.andP;  With this product, anapplication can be developed using object-oriented tools, or the code whichhas been generated by the tools can be retrieved from a window and modified.andM;According to Gupta, &quot;The on-us for making this work together is on thefront-end vendors to provide drivers and routers, or on the connectivityvendors to do this for them.&quot;andP;  Gupta claims that it is easier for a companylike his, with tools for the front end and back end, to solve this problemfor its customers.andM;Forecasts of the MS-DOS, OS/2 and Unix share of the desktop operating systemmarket vary widely.andP;  Although none seem to have the ability to eliminate theothers, there is movement toward interoperability of these environments.andM;In support of interoperability, some companies have created products thathide the differences.andP;  For example, Choreographer will generate a userinterface for Windows or Presentation Manager.andP;  Of course, each proposedgraphical user interface standard claims to have its own advantage.andP;  Toolsthat generate multiple interfaces, however, must operate at the lowest commondenominator level, sacrificing some of the capabilities.andM;Oracle Corp. of Belmont, Calif., is planning to offer facilities to hide thenetwork.andP;  According to Gene Shklar, director of marketing for Oracle'sNetwork Products Division, users should be able to turn on the network in thesame way that they turn on the personal computer today.andP;  The network shouldappear to users as a transparent set of services and resources.andM;&quot;Enterprise computing is in the Heathkit stage today,&quot; Shklar said.andP;  Oracleis creating &quot;Universal directory Service,&quot; a product that would talk toproducts such as Banyan's Street Talk, Sun's Yellow Pages, TCP/IP's Domainand DEC's Distributed Name Service.andP;  Also, a &quot;Universal AuthenticationService&quot; will provide one log-on to the network.andP;  Based on this log-on, UASwould talk to the other servers on the user's behalf, Shklar said.andM;Application developers need to be able to construct, test and installapplications into a client/server configuration.andP;  This problem brings newconcerns to the issues of library control and change management.andM;DECENTRALIZED DATA CENTERandM;One of the results of client/server computing is the decentralization of thedata center.andP;  Alan Pearson of Bank of America, who is implementing bankingapplications using OS/2 workstations and DB2 server, said, &quot;It's like havinglots of little data centers out there.andP;  .  .  .  What happens when you wantto make a change, or diagnose a problem, or tune performance?andP;  You can'treally call someone at 3 a.m.andP;  in a bank branch somewhere and ask them toreboot from the A drive.andP;  There's nobody home.&quot;andM;According to Pearson, &quot;IBM's Repository and NetView products are envisionedas the information resource and management tools to support large-scaleclient/server environments.&quot;andM;Sybase's Epstein said that a client/server architecture must be built basedon the potential that the clients will be loading their own software.andP;  &quot;Youhave to construct the system assuming that the KGB is writing the applicationand the U.S.andP;  is writing the servers.andP;  The secret to making the whole thingwork is making the servers smart enough so that the application can't trickthem,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We stress the importance of making the servers embody allthe business logic to decide if it's a reasonable transaction or not.&quot;andM;The outlook as we move to client/server computing is that mainframes willbecome large file servers, as the users interface and processing logic moveto the client platform.andP;  Mainframe environments have the networks in placeneeded to support client/server.andP;  These networks have driven dumb terminalsin the past, but are increasingly routing messages from personal computers tothe mainframe.andP;  So the move from a mainframe perspective is evolutionary inthe direction of moving processing off the mainframe, but keeping the datacentrally controlled.andM;&quot;Data processing organizations are committing their resources to providingadded functionality.andP;  There is no time to go back and rearchitect existingsystems, especially when you can improve their value by moving processing tothe client and continue to use the existing application as a server,&quot; saidAspen Research's Parnass.andM;While the technology still has some kinks, client/server computing isdefinitely moving forward.andP;  It seems that those who see it from the mainframeperspective feel that if users can be given a friendlier interface that isintuitive and self-teaching, then client/server is worthwhile.andM;ADDED VALUEandM;From the personal computer perspective, if client/server lets users shareresources over the network, this is added value.andP;  From the user's point ofview, client/server computing can provide more robust applications withmultiple windows, multitasking at the workstation, collaborative work andseamless transition between internal applications like American's InteractiveDinamo and packaged applications like Microsoft Excel, running under OS/2.andM;According to Epstein, the applications requirements, not the technology, willdrive the move to client/server computing.andP;  &quot;People buy OS/2 because theyneed it for networking, not because it's new or discounted.andP;  The same is truefor workstations and database technology.andP;  The applications requirements aredriving the move toward client/server computing.&quot;andM;The first appilcation is often a departmental system: The users in adepartment need to be able to work with a lot of data at once, and the dataneeds to be presented in a format that makes it more comprehensible.andP;  Thiscalls for a bit-mapped graphical user interface and a database manager.andM;Once the first application shows its benefits, others follow.andP;  &quot;We arebeginning to talk to customers about using our technology at the enterpriselevel,&quot; Epstein said.andP;  &quot;As we show that we can provide increased capabilityon lower-cost platforms, we expect more applications to more toward thisapproach.&quot;andM;But the movement may be slow.andP;  In a recent study of the database market bySentry Market Research, Westborough, Mass., fewer than 20% had evaluated aclient/server database product.andM;Bill Braasch is president and founder of Data Base Architects, Inc., aconsulting firm located in Alameda, Calif.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
