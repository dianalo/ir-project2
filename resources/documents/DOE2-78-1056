<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-1056 </DOCNO><TEXT>It has been shown that the highest critical currents in fine filamentNbTi conductors are obtained when the filaments are closely spaced. However,the filaments in a composite with a high purity copper matrix tend tobe coupled via the &quot;proximity effect&quot; as the filament spacing is reducedleading to large magnetization at low fields. To reduce the &quot;proximity&quot;coupling, trial billets of NbTi have been fabricated with Cu-30% Ni matrix,Cu-0.5% Mn matrix and one with a Ni barrier around the filaments. Wiresdrawn from these billets have shown that this interfilament couplingcan be suppressed for very small filament separations. A full sized commercialbullet with Cu-0.5% Mn matrix demonstrates that high J/sub c/ conductorswith filament size -- 1-5 {mu}m can be fabricated which show no interfilamentcoupling at low fields.</TEXT></DOC>
