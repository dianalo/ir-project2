Mr. President, when you were sayingbefore that you wouldn't allow a carte blanche to any attempted coup inPanama, you're reserving to yourself the right to evaluate the merits ofany potential coup. This implies, however, better communications with theparticipants than you had. In fact, it appears that the United States didn'tknow a good deal of the time what was going on during the crucial hoursof that Tuesday coup in Panama. What sort of urgency _ here's the question_ what sort of urgency are you giving to improving those procedures?   A. We're reviewing the procedures to see, but, if there's some, can't,if we can't do it better. But let me just reiterate: There's enough knownabout this that nothing different would have happened, and I keep comingback to that as the fundamental point. That isn't to say we can't do thingsbetter, but you've got to look at where these _ in this particular instance_ the people were coming from, what they _ what their objectives were.I know what the United States' objectives are: one, Noriega broughtto justice; and, very important, a Panama under democratic rule, not denythe people the very election that they had. And so these are our objectives.These are the objectives of the United States. And I will look at whatevercomes up in the future with those objectives in mind.    Q. Well, justto follow, on the day of the coup _    A. Hey, I've got a 10:00 meeting.   Q. On the day of the coup we hear about telephone calls that aren'treturned, we hear about people who are using phone numbers that they're_    A. Yeah.    Q. _ given for contact with the U.S. and when they call,they do not get help. The official _    A. That's well worth looking into.   Q. _ ( ff mike) _    A. Exactly.    Q. That's what I mean when Isuggest the urgency about it.    A. No. I think you've got a good pointthere. And we will be doing everything we can to fine tune the mechanism.Everyone knows that, when you have a combat situation, and there waswith the PDF and the coup people, it isn't all that clear. But to the degreewe can improve our communications, fine. But I don't feel _ again, I wantto just end up where I started. I don't feel, in looking at all the chargesand the allegations of this nature and having them assessed both here anddown in Panama by our leaders, that it would have led me as the presidentto do something different in this particular coup.    But you raise avery good point. When I hear something that there was a, you know, a phonenumber given and nobody answers the phone, we'll find out what's the importance_ what's the significance of that.    I really do have a 10:00.    Thisis not a _    Q. How's your hand?    A. Lesley, I was hoping you'd ask.   Q. Secretary Baker said the military a _    Q. Why did you put a ``gagorder'' on members of the administration telling them not to second-guesshow you and other members of the administration handled _    A. Listen,we've been blessed in this administration by a good team who don't likethe game of ``who's up, who's down, who's winning, who's losing, who'slooking good, who's in, who's out.'' And I did not have to have any gagorder because all of them are singing from the same sheet of music. Sothere wasn't a gag order.    Q. You didn't tell people to stop complaining?   A. No.    Q. A week ago?    A. No.    Q. Did you get angry?   A. And I didn't get angry. I didn't get angry.    Q. What did you _   A. What I did say is I don't want to see any blame coming out of theOval Office, or attributed to the Oval Office, in the face of criticism.I'm not in the blame business. Blame, if there's some to be assigned, itcomes in there, and that's where it belongs.</TEXT></DOC>
