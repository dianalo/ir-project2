Bell Group said events beyond both parties' control frustrated their contract, which had called for the payment of about 475 million Australian dollars ($338.7 million) to Fairfax. Mr. Holmes a Court had been pressing Fairfax to lower the price, according to sources close to the negotiations, especially after the October stock-market crash, which has prompted asset sales by the Australian financier's companies.    After studying the Fairfax media operations, Mr. Holmes a Court wanted to drop the ones incurring losses. Fairfax and Bell Group also couldn't agree on details of printing and distribution arrangements for the newspapers. Bell Group doesn't have a national newspaper network and needed Fairfax to help with production.    Since October, Mr. Holmes a Court's companies have been shedding assets to raise money for debt payments. The sales have raised more than four billion dollars, though they have resulted in losses estimated at 512 million dollars for Mr. Holmes a Court's companies.    Fairfax also has been selling assets to cut the borrowing costs of its takeover last year by a member of the founding family, Warwick Fairfax. Fairfax, Australia's biggest publisher after Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., has sold its magazine division and some smaller newspapers, but it hasn't been able to complete plans to sell other assets to Mr. Holmes a Court and Mr. Murdoch.    Bell Group had agreed last September to buy from Fairfax the daily Australian Financial Review, the Australian paper Times on Sunday, the New Zealand daily National Business Review and other media interests. Late last year, Mr. Holmes a Court exercised an option to sell the Australian Macquarie radio network back to Fairfax for 158 million dollars.    Fairfax said it is studying ways to keep all or part of the business newspapers and the Times on Sunday. A Fairfax official said a foreign partner, such as the British publisher Pearson PLC, might be sought for the business newspapers. Pearson was negotiating with Mr. Holmes a Court to acquire at least half the Australian Financial Review before Bell Group's agreement with Fairfax was ended.    In London, Frank Barlow, chief executive officer of Pearson's Financial Times unit, said: &quot;We have been informed that the Bell Group and Fairfax do not intend to proceed with the transfer of the Australian Financial Review Group. This does not diminish our interest in this title and we shall now be contacting Fairfax directly.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
