Acoustic reflectors correlate with changes ingrain size within cores, and generally represent coarser layers withinthe muddy deposits of the delta. Measurement of compressional-wave seismicvelocity and saturated bulk density demonstrate that the correlationresults from changes in acoustic impedance, caused by the grain-sizevariations. The reflectors reveal two predominant types of seismic stratigraphy:depositional and erosional. The depositional stratigraphy contains reflectorsformed by relatively subtle change in grain size. Gently dipping topsetand steeply dipping foreset demonstrate upward and seaward progradationof the subaqueous delta. This stratigraphy is truncated by erosionalreflectors, which are significantly coarser layers. The erosional reflectorsdivide the depositional stratigraphy into distinct sets. The prevalenceof erosional reflectors is greatest in the topset region near the rivermouth, suggesting that sediment in this region, which is rapidly accumulatingon 100-year time scales, has been eroded over longer time scales withinthe Holocene.</TEXT></DOC>
