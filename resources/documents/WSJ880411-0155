Manuel Noriega's regime in Panama represent the most cautious tack proposed by senior Reagan aides, who weighed options ranging from a full trade embargo to direct military intervention.    But this calibrated new move is nevertheless a gamble. While some State Department hardliners fretted that the sanctions may have come too late, others in the Pentagon and the National Security Council hesitated to impose them for fear they could stir pro-Noriega, anti-U.S. feeling and cause enduring structural damage to the Panamanian economy.    If these moves don't force out Gen. Noriega, stronger options will be considered, officials said. However, a ban on all imports and exports, a revocation of Panamanian landing rights and a full travel embargo may be counterproductive because the U.S. is trying to maintain support among the Panamanian people. Military options also are troublesome, particularly because 15,000 to 20,000 U.S. citizens remain in Panama.    White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker conceded Saturday that so far, the administration's economic pressure on Panama has failed. The actions &quot;undoubtedly hurt the people of Panama more than they hurt him,&quot; Sen. Baker said. &quot;Gen. Noriega, no doubt, has money squirreled away, who knows where, and, I doubt very much that we have done much to interrupt his life style or to diminish his assets.&quot;    The president's decision Friday to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, effective immediately, freezes Panamanian government assets in the U.S. and prohibits Panama-based subsidiaries of U.S. companies, as well as U.S. parent companies and individuals, from paying taxes, fees, utility bills and other payments due to the Noriega-controlled Panama government.    Such funds are to be placed in alternative accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to be used in transactions authorized by U.S.-recognized Panamanian officials, including embattled Panamanian President Eric Delvalle. The freeze on Panamanian assets in the U.S. involves almost exclusively money held in U.S. banks, administration officials said.    The sanctions were announced here by senior White House aides as President Reagan neared the end of his 10-day vacation. Mr. Reagan's invocation of the emergency act is expected to affect Panama far more than previous uses of the act because Panama relies so heavily on U.S. trade and uses the dollar as its currency.    White House officials have stressed that U.S. companies expecting to suffer undue hardship under the new sanctions may apply for exemptions from the Treasury Department. Already exempted from the prohibition are interbank clearing payments on checks and other financial transactions. The Treasury Department is expected also to exempt small payments by U.S. citizens for utility bills and other minor obligations to the Panamanian government.    Violations of the sanctions could prompt criminal penalties, including $50,000 in fines or 10 years in prison, officials said.    These new sanctions, which must be renewed each year by executive order, are expected to affect at least 100 American companies. The Reagan administration initially had asked for voluntary diversion of payments to the special U.S. bank accounts. But some companies, including United Brands Co., which handles most of Panama's banana trade, and Texaco Inc., which refines oil in Panama, made their payments as usual to the Noriega-backed government, providing his regime with much-needed cash.    The sanctions also could affect airlines, which might lose landing rights by refusing to pay landing fees. A spokeswoman for Texas Air Inc., whose Eastern Airlines unit flies to Panama, said the company would comply with the new sanctions. Among the other companies expected to be affected are Black andamp; Decker Corp., Johnson andamp; Johnson, International Business Machines Corp., Eastman Kodak Co., Philip Morris Cos., and Exxon Co.    State Department officials, who have been fighting for firmer action against Mr. Noriega, believe the impact would have been greater if the sanctions had been imposed along with other anti-Noriega measures earlier. Lack of such action has given Gen. Noriega some breathing room to find sources of capital to keep his economy limping along, these officials said.    ---   Frederick Kempe in Washington contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
