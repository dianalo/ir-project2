 The 3B2/1000 system itself is available in three versions, Models 60,70, and 80, designed by ATandamp;T to support 64, 80, and 100 users, respectively.andO;The 3B2/1000 is targeted primarily at multiuser commercial applications thatrequire connectivity to many separate serial devices, as is evident in boththe size of the base system cabinet and its electrical design.andP;  The Model 80supports two to four processors and is priced starting at $74,900.andM;Models 60 and 70 differ from the Model 80 primarily in their processor clockspeeds and the kinds of additional CPUs (called processing elements by ATandamp;T)that they can accommodate.andP;  Since all three models are in the same productfamily, their base prices are clustered fairly close together.andP;  The Model 60has a base price of $39,900 (with 4 MB of ECC RAM), while the Model 70 has abase price of $59,900 (with 16 MB of ECC RAM).andP;  The company offers options toupgrade earlier models of the 3B2 family to the 3B2/1000, as well as optionsto upgrade the 3B2/1000 Models 60 and 70 to the Model 80.andP;  The benchmarkresults presented in this review should be somewhat higher than thoseobtainable using other 3B2 systems.andP;  The 3B2/1000 Models 60 and 70 becameavailable in March, 1989, the Model 80 in May.andM;The 3B2 systems are based on the WE 32000 family of chips.andP;  This chipset, notto be confused with the similarly numbered 32000 family from NationalSemiconductor, contains a 32-bit microprocessor, a math unit, and amemory-management unit (MMU).andP;  The WE 32000 was one of the first true 32-bitmicroprocessor chips available.andP;  The 3B2/1000 Model 80 uses thethird-generation WE 32200 CPU, the 32201 MMU, and the 32206 FPU.andP;  Theprocessor clock rate for the 3B2/1000 is 24 MHz, and its processor cardcontains an on-board 8 KB cache.andM;The 3B2/1000 Model 80's cabinet is 13 inches tall, 17 inches wide, and 24-1/2inches deep.andP;  The purpose of providing such an enormous box is expansion: alarge number of options can be placed in the standard system case, obviatingthe necessity for external expansion units.andM;The 3B2/1000 Model 80 comes with a 120 MB cartridge-tape drive and a 720 KBfloppy-disk drive.andP;  We found that the tape cartridges could be interchangedwith those of any other system we had that used the QIC-120 tape format.andO;This was very useful in our benchmark testing, as it was the fastest way tomove code to the 3B2 and off-load the test results.andP;  The diskettes, on theother hand, could not be interchanged with diskettes from any other UNIXsystem that we had.andM;The base 3B2/1000 Model 80 comes with two &quot;300 MB&quot; 5-1/4-inch SCSI diskdrives.andP;  These actually appear to have a 322 MB capacity, however.andP;  There isroom in the chassis for one additional disk drive, allowing for a total ofthree SCSI drives in the base cabinet (1 GB total capacity).andP;  It does notseem that higher-capacity 5-1/4-inch drives are available at this time, butwe expect that ATandamp;T could configure a machine to support 700 MB 5-1/4-inchSCSI internal drives whenever it chooses.andP;  Additional SCSI drives can besupported outside of the case.andP;  ATandamp;T claims that the Model 80 is capable ofaccommodating over 15 GB of mass storage.andM;Base memory on the 3B2/1000 Model 80 is 16 MB of ECC RAM, contained on oneRAM card.andP;  Up to four such RAM cards can be contained in the box, for a totalof 64 MB of RAM.andM;A standard Model 80 contains two processors, the main processor and oneprocessing element (PE).andP;  Two additional PEs can be installed in the systembox.andP;  ATandamp;T rates the two-processor version of the Model 80 at 9 MIPS, thethree-processor system at 12.5 MIPS, and the four-processor system at 16MIPS.andM;There are 12 I/O slots in the system chassis.andP;  Of these, one is used by adisk controller; in the Model 80, the 11 others are available for customeruse.andP;  An option frequently exercised here is the ATandamp;T eight-port serial card.andO;With 11 of these cards, the base system would support 88 serial ports.andP;  Inaddition to these optional I/O cards, the Model 80 has two standard built-inports, one of which is used by the system console.andM;Beyond this already impressive system capacity, other hardware options areavailable for the entire 3B2 line.andP;  Nine-track tape drives seem to be aparticularly common storage option on larger commercial configurations.andO;These drives, though, are offered as units external to the base system case,unlike the other hardware options discussed above, which are installed in themain case.andM;Software for the 3B2 family comes from a variety of sources.andP;  ATandamp;T, ofcourse, supplies UNIX System V and a C compiler.andP;  The compilers recommendedare LPI FORTRAN and Micro Focus COBOL.andP;  A number of software packages havebeen made available as a result of a major government contract ATandamp;T woninvolving the 3B2/1000.andP;  In addition, a base of 3B2 applications has grownover time since the machines are binary-compatible, and because the productfamily has been on the market for quite a while.andP;  Thus, software selection,both language compilers and applications, is quite broad.andM;The 3B2/1000 Model 80 we benchmarked contained the standard 16 MB of ECC RAM,32 serial ports on the I/O bus (plus the two built-in ports), three 322 MBSCSI drives and a controller, and two processors (the base CPU and one PE).andO;The system also contained 120 MB cartridge-tape and 720 KB 5-1/4-inchfloppy-disk drives.andP;  For a console terminal we used an ATandamp;T 615 colorwindowing terminal.andP;  Software on the system included C, LPI FORTRAN, andMicro Focus COBOL.andP;  For all of the benchmarks we used only two of the 322 MBdisk drives (those in the standard system), and the pricing shown herereflects the use of only these first two drives.andP;  The system and terminalconfiguration that was benchmarked costs $76,250.andP;  The C compiler andutilities cost another $3000, the LPI FORTRAN rings up at $5195, and theMicro Focus COBOL compiler has a $7500 price tag ($1500 for runtime-onlyCOBOL).andM;PurchasingandM;ATandamp;T systems can be procured through several channels.andP;  First, a system canbe purchased from the direct sales force maintained by ATandamp;T for the 3B2family.andP;  Second, ATandamp;T has a number of resellers and master distributors,including at least two national industrial electronics distributors.andO;Finally, there are ATandamp;T VARs that resell the 3B2 family.andP;  Finding an agentfrom which to purchase the system is not difficult.andM;Purchasing through the resellers or VARs is generally easy, but we have noexperience in buying directly from ATandamp;T.andP;  However, the discounts offered on3B2 equipment through the resellers or VARs seemed small, judging from ourprevious experience with these distribution channels.andP;  The quoted price of asystem was fairly close to its list price, at least for quantity-onepurchases.andM;The 3B2/1000 Model 80 system uses proprietary boards for all functions, whichmust apparently be purchased from ATandamp;T, as they are not supplied by manythird-party suppliers.andP;  This results in somewhat higher costs for the boards.andO;In more competitive computer environments, suppliers would be unable tocharge as much for each particular option.andM;We found it surprisingly hard to determine the prices for the Model 80'soptions.andP;  While prices for the base system and most software packages arereadily available, prices for options such as the eight-port serial board arevery difficult to obtain.andP;  No one that we spoke with had the informationreadily available.andM;We also have concerns about ATandamp;T's configuration recommendations.andP;  The salesliterature implies that 100 users can be supported on systems with 16 MB ofRAM, for example.andP;  We found this scenario questionable at best, as it woulddepend heavily upon the actual applications involved.andM;InstallationandM;The initial installation or upgrading of the UNIX operating system is donewith the built-in cartridge-tape drive, and other packages (C compiler andutilities, and language compilers) are installed via a floppy-disk drive.andO;The entire operating system is contained on one cartridge tape, and theprompting menus are fairly easy to follow, making the installation processeasy.andP;  UNIX was pre-installed on our system, so all that was required was theinstallation of the optional language products.andM;Our only objection to the installation scripts concerns one menu in whichseveral prompts seem unclear.andP;  Users choose one prompt if the medium is afloppy disk, and another if the medium is a cartridge tape.andP;  Rather thanstating this outright, the prompts employ obscure language, requiring thatusers refer to the manual to be sure what to do.andM;We found the floppy-disk installation a little slow--the machine took longerto read a disk than expected.andP;  On the other hand, the cartridge-tape drivewas the fastest we have used.andP;  We have observed that most tape drives,although they use streaming tapes, incorporate substantial numbers ofstart/stop sequences that result in large time penalties during simple datatransfers.andP;  The ATandamp;T tape drive nearly always performed reads and writeswithout pausing.andM;Support and DocumentationandM;ATandamp;T manuals are the base manuals used by most other manufacturers todocument their UNIX products.andP;  It seems that other manufacturers start withoriginal ATandamp;T documentation, and &quot;improve&quot; it in a variety of ways.andP;  Afterusing other manufacturers' manuals, therefore, ATandamp;T manuals seem fairlyordinary.andP;  The manual pages are a convenient size (6 inches by 8-1/2 inches),and are provided, for the most part, in loose-leaf binders.andM;In terms of physical volume, ATandamp;T provides less documentation than we hadexpected.andP;  This is not necessarily bad, of course.andP;  The standard UNIXreference manuals are presented in their typical form, as well as enoughother documentation to make the system useable.andP;  The only manual that meritsspecial comment is the system administration document.andP;  We found this volumeto be particularly well-written, complete, and easy to read and use.andM;We found the documentation lacking in one major respect, though: severalcommands documented in the manuals were simply not on the system.andP;  Aftertrying to verify that we had a complete operating system on the disks, wecalled the ATandamp;T telephone support hotline to resolve the problem.andP;  It turnsout that there are, in fact, documented UNIX system commands that are justnot supported anymore.andP;  Typically, we use the UNIX tar command to move ourbenchmarks to a new system, and to pack and unpack small file systems.andP;  Whiletar does appear in the ATandamp;T documentation in its normal form, it is notsupplied in the current UNIX version.andP;  The tar utility is only supplied onthe nine-track tape shipped by ATandamp;T.andP;  There was, unfortunately, no mention ofthe availability or status of this command in the documentation.andM;ATandamp;T provides a toll-free number for support.andP;  We used this hotline severaltimes for real questions related to the 3B2, and in general received positiveresults.andP;  The toll-free number connects the caller to an administrativeassistant who takes serial numbers and other information related to thesystem in question.andP;  While it is supposedly possible to speak to a technicalperson immediately if they are available, all of our calls required acall-back at a later time.andP;  It took, on the average, six hours before thereturn call was received, which seems a bit too long.andM;From talking with ATandamp;T technical support our overall impression is positive.andO;We got proper answers to all our questions in a much more timely fashion thanwith most other hotlines we have tried.andP;  We feel, though, that the supportstaff does not have much experience with the 3B2/1000 system itself, becausemost of the answers, while correct, left out any 3B2/1000-specific details.andO;In every case, however, the answers were close enough to solve the particularproblem.andM;Operation and Ease of UseandM;The ATandamp;T 3B2/1000 uses UNIX System V Release 3.2.2.andP;  As the base standard forUNIX, the operating system was comfortable for us from the beginning--we feltwe had used this system before.andP;  The administration required was typical ofSystem V, and we found it to be essentially equivalent to other System Vpackages, such as System V/386 for 80386-based personal computers.andM;Comparing the administration required on the 3B2 to that required on the NCR32/450 reviewed previously (see UNIX REVIEW, Vol.andP;  7 No.andP;  7) leads us to theopinion that the NCR machine, which has more shells, provides an easierinterface to system functions.andP;  The 3B2 is not bad, but it is harder to workwith than other systems with which it competes.andM;The 3B2 Model 80 requires that a serial terminal be used as the console.andP;  Weused an ATandamp;T 615 color windowing terminal for this purpose.andP;  This is anoutstanding terminal with a wide range of features--the keyboard is great andthe characters are crisp.andP;  We have no complaints about the terminal alone; wedid, however, have some problems with its interface to the system.andP;  Unlikeother terminal manuals we have seen, the manual for the 615 has a sectiondevoted to the terminfo personality of the 615.andP;  However, the 615terminal--despite its ATandamp;T origins--does not appear in the termcap orterminfo entries that come with the operating system.andP;  Thus, although it wasnot difficult to make use of the terminal, it required changing the terminalentries in the system, which made things more difficult than we thoughtnecessary.andM;From a hardware perspective, we like the use of a QIC-120 tape on the 3B2.andO;We were not happy with the 5-1/4-inch 720 KB floppy drive.andP;  The 1.2 MB,5-1/4-inch format is standard enough that most personal computers runningUNIX can interchange 5-1/4-inch media and read MS-DOS diskettes.andP;  We believethat the 3B2 would be improved by also having this ability.andP;  Finally, theconnectors for the serial ports on the 3B2 I/O cards are RJ-45 eight-pinmodular connectors that are often used by telephone equipment.andP;  Although theyare not particularly difficult to find or use, this is the first system wehave used that required these connectors.andM;All 3B2/1000 models come with a one-year warranty, which is better than whatmany competitive manufacturers offer on similar systems.andP;  In a commercialenvironment, where the system maintenance is likely to be provided by themanufacturer, the difference between the 90-day warranty typically offeredand a one-year warranty can easily be $ 5000 or more.andM;We did not find that anything about this system made it particularly easy, ordifficult, to use.andP;  It functioned like a standard UNIX system with ascrolling interface to a dumb terminal, with typical UNIX terminalcharacteristics.andP;  It is hard to become excited about the user interface, evenwith a smart multitasking terminal, when we are used to full windowingfunctions on high-resolution workstation displays.andP;  Although the 3B2 userinterface is workable, it is just not as &quot;fun&quot; as other interface stylestoday.andM;PerformanceandM;The ATandamp;T 3B2/1000 Model 80 is a multiuser system.andP;  The first tests we alwaysrun on a system, involving display speed and common user functions, made themachine seem sluggish.andP;  The console runs at 9600 baud, which consequentlylimits character I/O performance.andP;  Our set of typical user functions,including disk and tape copies, yielded a mixed set of performance results.andO;While the tape drive seemed very fast, disk performance seemed low, and otherfunctions were acceptable, if not spectacular.andM;Figure 1 shows the Dhrystone, Whetstone, and Linpack (MFLOPS) performance forthis system compared with that of several other systems commonly used ascommercial multiuser boxes.andP;  We note here that while the 3B2/1000 Model 80 ispurportedly capable (according to ATandamp;T) of supporting 100 users or more, allthe other systems shown are 30- to 40-user systems, except the NCR 32/400,which is rated at 16 users.andP;  In addition, the 3B2 costs approximately twiceas much as any other system shown in Figure 1, so any comparison should bebiased accordingly.andM;The tests for which results are shown in Figure 1 are typically thought of asCPU- and FPU-intensive single-user benchmarks.andP;  Nothing in the tests makesuse of the disk, or of any features in the system that were designed to boostmultiuser performance.andP;  The 3B2 Dhrystone rating is 4125--roughly equivalentto the Dhrystone rating of 20 MHz 68020-based or 16 MHz 80386-based machinesthat have no cache.andP;  The NCR 32/400 used to generate the data in Figure 1 wasequipped with a 16.67 MHz 68020, while the NCR 32/450 used a 25 MHz 68020.andO;Therefore, the performance figures for those two systems bracket those of the3B2.andM;A common--if flawed--way to calculate a system's MIPS rating is to divide itsDhrystone rating by that of a DEC VAX, which is generally thought of as a&quot;1-MIPS system&quot;.andP;  By this rule, the 3B2 rates as a 3-MIPS system, not a9-MIPS machine, as claimed by ATandamp;T.andP;  But the 3B2 has two processors in thebase unit that are combined to provide the 9 MIPS rating, and the Dhrystonetest runs on only one processor.andP;  If we assume that each CPU provides halfthe rated performance, then ATandamp;T is claiming 4.5 MIPS per CPU and we aremeasuring 3 MIPS.andP;  This is a reasonably valid analysis--we do, in fact,believe that each of the 3B2/1000 Model 80 processors rate closer to 3 MIPSthan to 4.5 MIPS.andM;The Whetstone and Linpack benchmark results shown in Figure 1 arefloating-point intensive tests written in FORTRAN.andP;  By tradition, we striveto present data for every system we have reviewed, but we acknowledge thatthe applicability of these FORTRAN results may be limited, since commercialmultiuser systems do not run floating-point intensive FORTRAN programs often.andO;The relatively low performance shown for these programs is still of interest,however.andM;When we ran Whetstones or other math programs written in C on the 3B2/1000Model 80, we got performance ratings substantially higher than obtained fromrunning the equivalent FORTRAN programs.andP;  We used a current LPI FORTRANcompiler for these tests.andP;  The C compiler generated code that made use of theWE 32206 math chip, but there was no discussion in the manual ordocumentation of how to access the chip using the FORTRAN compiler.andP;  As aresult, all FORTRAN math operations and functions were done by software, andthe results shown in Figure 1 correspond to this software-only approach.andP;  So,although the 3B2 itself comes with a math chip that is competitive with a68881 or 80387 FPU, this hardware is not reflected in our FORTRAN benchmarkresults.andP;  If the FORTRAN compiler had been able to use the FPU, we wouldexpect results similar to those shown for the cached NCR 32/400, based on theATandamp;T machine's performance on math tests written in C.andM;Figure 2 shows disk-transfer rates, in KB per second, for machinessequentially reading 2 MB of data from an 8 MB file.andP;  The block size for thistest varies from 512 to 8192 bytes.andP;  The 3B2's performance on this test wasat best average, being somewhat higher than that of the NCR 32/400 and 450systems, but substantially lower than that of the other systems shown.andM;As is true of the tests shown in Figure 1, the disk-transfer test is rununder single-user conditions.andP;  While it accurately reflects best-caseperformance for the system, as well as the performance of a lightly-loadedmultiuser system, different results might be obtained using a benchmark thathas many tasks waiting to execute.andM;Figure 3 shows test results of several machines randomly reading 2 MB of datafrom an 8 MB file.andP;  This particular test is sensitive to system memory sizeand the amount of data read, as well as to the performance of the disk driveitself.andP;  The performance of the 3B2 was, again, average.andP;  It is better thanthat of the NCR products but not as good as that of the other systems tested.andM;In random read tests, a larger block size typically increases the transferrate (because of fewer physical reads); the ATandamp;T system's performance followsthis pattern.andP;  We wish to point out that the results shown in Figure 3 wereobtained from a 3B2/1000 system with 16 MB of RAM, whereas the other systemswere equipped with only 8 MB.andP;  Thus, the 3B2 results shown in Figure 3 areslightly inflated.andM;Observations from similar tests for data writes reveal that the ATandamp;T systemstill uses the concept of disk buffers.andP;  Unlike some other systems, in whichall of physical memory is available for any purpose, the ATandamp;T system resultsfollow a pattern typical of machines implementing a fixed number of logicaldisk buffers.andP;  For disk writes, as the amount of data written increases, thetransfer rate also increases, until a certain maximum file size is reached.andO;When the size of a file is increased again, the transfer rate begins to drop.andO;This is caused by the machine's limited number of disk I/O buffers--as longas the size of the buffers is larger than the file being written, write testsgenerally measure the time to fill buffers and run quite rapidly.andP;  Actualdisk performance can be measured only when the data the machine is writing islarger than the size of its disk buffers.andM;Figure 4 shows multitasking results for the 3B2 and other systems.andP;  Here theATandamp;T system does its best job, yielding performance better than the NCR32/450's and second only to the Mips M/120-5's.andP;  This test demonstrates howwell the system can handle multiple simultaneous tasks.andP;  Each of the taskslisted in Figure 4 is a mix of disk and CPU jobs.andP;  The performance shown inFigure 4 is a result of the two processors on the ATandamp;T system cooperating ontasks.andP;  This, combined with the 16 MB of RAM in the system, allows the fullresources of the ATandamp;T system to be used on these multitasking tests.andM;A COBOL benchmark we ran on all the systems yielded performance resultssimilar to those encountered in the Dhrystone test.andP;  The ATandamp;T 3B2/1000 ratedjust slightly better slightly better than the NCR 32/400 with cache, usingMicro Focus COBOL on both systems.andM;Figure 5 shows Workstation Laboratories' Khornerstone benchmark rating forthe systems selected.andP;  The Khornerstone test yields a normalized numericalrating of performance based on a mix of floating-point, processor, anddisk-intensive tests (21 in all) as well as another value representing thetotal time it takes to execute all of the tests.andP;  This test was designed toassess machines running a single-user workload.andM;The ATandamp;T 3B2/1000 Model 80 did not do particularly well on the Khornerstonetest, rating just above the NCR 32/400.andP;  The three FORTRAN floating-pointintensive tests in the Khornerstone benchmark contributed low values to the3B2's Khornerstone rating because of the FPU-access problem mentioned above.andO;But even if these tests did as well as they could with the 3B2 hardware, only300 or so additional Khornerstones would be achieved, and the relatverankings would not change.andM;Because of the second processor in the ATandamp;T system, two copies of theKhornerstone test can run at essentially the same rate as one copy, whereasthe performance of other systems falls in a multiple-copy run ofKhornerstone.andP;  Running more than two copies, however, a two-processor 3B2system's performance falls off, as would that of any other system.andM;A future review will provide detailed results of our full multiuser tests runon all the systems that appear in the figures in this article, plus one moremultiuser system.andP;  To fully test multiuser-system performance, there was noalternative but to drive multiple input lines with serial streams ofcharacters and examine the performance of disk, processor, and I/O-intensivetasks.andP;  Using a rack of PCs, several task scripts, and a variety of testprograms, we have been able to measure system performance for a variety ofrealistic scenarios.andP;  In general, on these multiuser tests the 3B2'sthroughput increases with the user load up to at least 30 simultaneous heavyusers, as it does, for example, on the NCR 32/450.andP;  But user response timebegins to increase substantially before that point, depending upon theapplication, and these user response times are significantly higher on the3B2 than on the 32/450 at high user loads.andM;Thus, we admit that the benchmarks in this review may not be totallyapplicable to a multiuser system, and only a later review will attempt toprovide the entire multiuser picture.andP;  On the other hand, we do believe thefollowing conclusions are valid:andM;* The 3B2/1000 Model 80 is a 3- to 4-MIPS-per-processor system.andM;* The second and successive processors do help multiuser/multitaskingperformance.andM;* For any one particular task or job, the system seems slow.andM;* Because of the multiple processors, the overall system performance degradesslowly as more users are added (throughput increases although response timemay degrade).andM;Price/PerformanceandM;Our price/performance rating is determined by dividing the list price of asystem by its Khornerstone rating.andP;  Figure 6 shows thedollars-per-Khornerstone results for a number of machines we have tested.andO;For each, we have used list prices (or in the case of the Altos machine,typically quoted prices) for the system, terminal, and software, and thendivided the total by the Khornerstone numbers presented in Figure 5.andM;Using this methodology, the price/performance of the ATandamp;T 3B2/1000 Model 80looks poor.andP;  Basically, the system performs like a single-user 20 MHz 68020,although it is priced to compete with low-end minicomputers and not withmicrocomputer systems.andP;  This results in a 15-to-1 price/performancedifference between the Mips M/120-5 and the ATandamp;T system, and more typically a6-to-1 to 3-to-1 difference between the ATandamp;T and other multiuser systems.andO;This difference in price/performance ratios narrows if the machine'sperformance on multiuser/multitasking tests is figured in instead of itsKhornerstone performance, because of the 3B2's additional processor.andP;  In nocase, however, does our comparison of price/performance ratings result in aratio of less than 2 to 1 in favor of the other comparable systems.andM;Report CardandM;The report card for the ATandamp;T 3B2/1000 Model 80 gives the system a grade of&quot;fair&quot; overall.andP;  Installation and support both rate as &quot;good&quot; for thissystem, and are quite reasonable with respect to competition in themarketplace.andP;  Documentation, however, rates only &quot;average&quot;, in scope andcontent.andM;Expandability is the strong point of the ATandamp;T 3B2/1000 system.andP;  There is roomin the basic system case for a large number of devices to be installed,including processors, disks, and memory.andP;  While the base system is ofreasonable size to begin with, the maximum system is quite impressive.andM;Operation and OS/Ease of Use both rate as &quot;fair&quot;.andP;  The system has fewoutstanding features in these respects and is not up to the level of thecompetition in support for window environments, foreign media support, systemadministration ease, or &quot;fun&quot; in system use.andM;Performance rates as &quot;fair&quot;.andP;  We are concerned that 3B2/1000 machines reallydo not meet their claim of 4.5 MIPS per processor (or 9 MIPS for the basesystem).andP;  The base dual-processor system looks more like a 6 or 6.5 MIPSsystem to us.andP;  Thus, with processor performance that matches a 20 MHz 68020,a single job does not run very fast.andP;  We acknowledge that if throughput in amultiprocessor system were used as a basis for the measure of performance, adifferent rating would be obtained.andM;Finally, price/performance is rated as &quot;poor&quot;.andP;  For a two-processor system ina multiuser environment, the 3B2's performance is at best comparable to thatof its top competitors: the IBM RT 135, the NCR 32/450, the Altos 2000, andthe Mips M/120-5.andP;  Yet the ATandamp;T system costs twice as much as any of theseother systems, resulting in a poor overall price/performance rating.andM;This review clearly reflects the biases of the author.andP;  Given a choice, Iprefer a responsive system to a system with high &quot;throughput&quot;.andP;  Atwo-processor ATandamp;T 3B2/1000 Model 80 seems to have two processors that eachrun at 3 MIPS, together yielding performance approximately equivalent to thatof the NCR 32/450 or IBM RT 135 systems (both rated at 5 to 6 MIPS).andP;  Thereis no doubt that the system is capable of connecting to 90 or more terminals,compared with 32 terminals maximum on an NCR 32/450 or 64 terminals on an NCR32/650.andP;  We suspect that a four-processor ATandamp;T system would perform betterthan a 32/650, but our primary objection here is that the ATandamp;T system coststwice as much.andM;David Wilson is president of Workstation Laboratories.andP;
