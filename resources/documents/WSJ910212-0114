O'Rourke will soon escape from his cozyresearch lab at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy,N.Y., to cool his heels at nearby Snyders Lake. Actually,he'll be &quot;on&quot; the lake (provided it's frozen -- and snowy).   He won't be ice fishing, though. The civil engineer willspend the long, cold hours studying the drifting whiteparticles. It sounds flaky, but it's all for science.</LP><TEXT>   Prof. O'Rourke devises design standards that engineers canuse to prevent buildings from collapsing under the weight ofsnow. He began 13 years ago, and his work has beensnowballing ever since. He has already developed onebreakthrough equation involving drifting snow loads as arecommended standard for building codes; it recently receivedthe American Society of Civil Engineers' stamp of approval.   He's now after No. 2. His earlier equation was basedsolely on a computer analysis of statistics and casehistories of roof collapses; it didn't factor in any physicalvariables, such as the wind, that govern drifting.&quot;Researchers never consider a problem solved,&quot; he notes.   At Snyders Lake, he and two undergraduate assistants willset up small-scale models of multilevel roof structures andsprinkle snow on them. Then, letting the wind take itscourse, they'll measure drifts, monitor wind speeds andrecord the experiment with a video camera.   Insurers don't give such research the cold shoulder.Between 1977 and 1989, one industry group reports, propertylosses from roof collapses totaled $382.6 million -- or$297,000 per loss. In 1978, Travelers Corp. faced a $12.5million claim after the roof of the Hartford Civic Center inConnecticut collapsed under the weight of snow. A courteventually found that faulty design was to blame, Travelerssays.   This winter, Prof. O'Rourke expects to be dealing withcold facts -- at temperatures possibly dipping below zerodegrees Fahrenheit and with the wind likely to be bitter. Buthe doesn't worry about frostbite. &quot;We can always go back tothe shore, get in the car, turn on the heat and get warm,&quot; hesays.   And what does the professor do in warmer weather? Hediverts some of his attention to his other specialty -- theeffects of earthquakes on underground pipelines. Quakes are ahotter topic these days, he says, adding: &quot;People findearthquakes generally more fascinating than snow loads. So Iusually talk about earthquakes when I'm at cocktail parties.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
