Once the sleepy domain of small-minded, small-townDemocratic barons, Florida has become a megastate,fourth-biggest in the nation. It is growing so fast it's asif the entire state of Connecticut had packed up and movedhere in the past decade. And as the shopping strips, tractdevelopments and condominiums spring up from pastures andswamplands, the Democrats' generations-old domination isslipping away. In the past decade they added 63,000 voters tothe rolls -- but the Republicans added a million.</LP><TEXT>   Now the Democrats will find out whether they can use thearcane process of redistricting to hold onto the politicalpower they're losing at the ballot box. Similar redistricting-- and politicking -- will take place in every state aslegislatures redraw boundaries to reflect new census figures.But here in Florida, the battle is especially remarkable.   By most measures, the Democrats here are in deep peril. Adozen years ago the Republicans accounted for only a fifth ofthe state's representation in the U.S. House; today they're amajority. Figures from the 1990 census, moreover, show thatbackwater counties where Republicans were a rare species havesuddenly become suburban sprawls with strong GOP tints.Republican registration in one small rural county grew by974%, in another by 890%.   As the citrus groves of Seminole County, on the outskirtsof Orlando, have been replaced in the past decade by low-risemulti-family housing units, population has grown by 65%, theDemocratic advantage has disappeared and the Republicans nowhave an overwhelming margin. A decade ago, Republicans inOkaloosa County, in the Panhandle between Pensacola andPanama City, were outnumbered three to one. But the countyhas grown by almost a third, and now the two parties areeven.   Though 56% of Floridians registered by party are stillDemocrats, that is down from 68% only a decade ago. &quot;ARepublican majority in Florida is inevitable, maybe evenbefore the end of the decade,&quot; says Richard Scher, aUniversity of Florida political scientist.   It is in this atmosphere of high-octane growth andhigh-stakes politics -- Florida will add four morecongressional seats next year -- that lawmakers will sit downto draw a new political map. And because the Democrats stillcling to power in the state legislature and won back thegovernor's mansion from a feckless Republican last November,they almost certainly will emerge in a far stronger position.&quot;The bargaining power of the Republican Party isn't very goodat all,&quot; says state Rep. Peter Wallace, chairman of the HouseReapportionment Committee. &quot;They're in a position to bargain,but not to win.&quot;   By the time the rubble of reapportionment is cleared away,the Democrats, who now hold only nine of Florida's 19 U.S.House seats, may have as many as 13. The Republicans, whohold 17 of the 40 seats in the state Senate, may findthemselves with only 13.   Though the process has barely started, GOP State ChairmanVan Poole is already calling Florida's redistricting &quot;anupscale jewelry heist&quot; and has hired a law firm to press acourt challenge. &quot;We've always been on the outside lookingin, watching them draw lines like a beautiful piece ofartwork,&quot; says Mr. Poole, himself a former state senator.&quot;It's totally unfair. The trends are going our way, but theyhave the pens and they're going to hurt us.&quot;   Responds state Sen. Jack Gordon, chairman of the SenateReapportionment Committee: &quot;We're going to adopt a very highstandard of fairness. We're going to treat the Republicans asfairly as they would have treated us. What more could theyask for?&quot;   But redistricting has always been more a political artthan a political science, with the politicians holding thepens holding the power. In the heyday of Florida's &quot;Pork ChopGang,&quot; the insular, segregationist Democrats who ruled thestate for decades, the deeply conservative Judge S.D. Clarke,who virtually controlled the state senate, represented 10,000people while a single senator in the Miami area representedmore than a million. As recently as the 1960s, lawmakerswhose districts covered only one-seventh of the state'spopulation represented half of both houses of thelegislature.   The state's political maps are only slightly less artfulsince the Supreme Court ruled nearly three decades ago thatall districts must contain roughly the same number of people.Today's Florida congressional map includes one district thatreaches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico andanother that has a slender arm reaching around Tampa Bay. Adecade ago a Democratic mapmaker drafted a legislativedistrict so carefully that he assured that the boundary wentaround his former wife's house.   This time the cartographers will have sophisticatedcomputers and software at their service, letting themcorrelate voting patterns to census data to calculate whetheradding a block here or a precinct there will add moreDemocrats to a district. The Supreme Court says only thatdistricts have to be of roughly equal population and thatthey can't dilute the voting strengths of racial minorities.&quot;There are thousands of potential ways of drawing 23congressional districts that would comply with the law,&quot; saysJohn Guthrie, staff director of the Senate ReapportionmentCommittee.   Many of the calculations are strategic rather thantechnical. The Democrats' political architects already arecontemplating putting Republican congressmen into the samedistrict in two instances. That would force the four GOPincumbents to compete for two seats, presumably knocking twoRepublicans out of Congress or forcing them to move. TheDemocrats are also planning to pack as many Republicans asthey can into a few districts -- one in the Panhandle, one inMiami, perhaps another in the Sarasota area. That would leavethe adjacent areas more accommodating to Democrats.   State Sen. Karen Thurmond, chairman of the Senate'scongressional reapportionment committee, will take particularinterest in how the lines are drawn in central Florida: Shewants a comfortable Democratic House district because sheintends to run for the seat.   Republicans warn that even if the Democrats prevail withtheir redistricting plans, they eventually will be flooded byan irresistible GOP tide. &quot;Long term, we're going to getthem,&quot; says John &quot;Mac&quot; Stipanovich, a close adviser to formerGOP Gov. Bob Martinez. &quot;We're going to dance on theirgraves.&quot;   Many Democrats suspect he may be right. &quot;One of thechallenges for Democrats in redistricting is that the newRepublicans tend to be in the population growth areas,&quot; saysRep. Wallace, the House reapportionment chairman. &quot;Thedistricts that shrink geographically will be sheddingRepublicans into neighboring districts. That means all thosenew Republicans are eventually going to catch up with us.&quot;   Not that the Democrats can act without checks.Redistricting, of course, is subject to court challenges. Andfive counties in central and southern Florida are subject tofederal review because they have large non-English-speakingpopulations.   The Democratic hope, in the words of Alan Stonecipher,executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, is thatat least &quot;we can pass a plan that gives us marginaladvantage, buys us some time and maybe sets us up for someopportunities in the future.&quot;   But they have to move fast. The state is gaining 966people a day, and they are transforming its landscape and itscharacter. With the University of Florida's College ofBusiness Administration projecting that the state'spopulation, already over 13 million, will grow by aboutanother 2.8 million before the 1990s are out, the state facesenormous financial challenges. Its schools had to absorb103,000 additional students last fall alone.   Florida now has 2.3 million people over the age of 65, afigure greater than the entire population of Kansas; thestate says Florida will need 11,000 new nursing-home beds bythe year 2000 -- a 28% increase. Prison admissions grew at anannual rate of 25% between 1983 and 1987. Transportationlinks are strained in the Gold Coast counties of Dade andBroward; the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas grew by 530,000in the last decade, about the size of the state of Vermont.&quot;It begins to make you wonder if anyone's left in Ohio,&quot; saysEdward Montanaro, director of Florida's Economic andDemographic Research Division.   The result is that Florida now is a nation-state, with 11media markets. Most of the growth is occurring in theunincorporated or suburban areas, which are growing twice asfast as municipal areas. &quot;This is a postwar state really,growing with the automobile,&quot; says Carol Taylor, director ofeconomic forecasting at the University of Florida. &quot;We don'thave the huge downtowns that there are in the East.&quot;   These suburban-type areas tend to become Republican. ClayCounty, which was rural only a decade ago, now has become abedroom suburb of Jacksonville, and Democrats in Clay Countyhave awakened to find that their big margin has disappeared.Sarasota County grew by 32%, with virtually all of the growthcoming in old pine-covered woods outside of the urban area;the Republicans who a decade ago had a small margin nowoutnumber Democrats nearly two to one. In none of Florida's67 counties did Democratic enrollment outpace Republicanenrollment in the 1980s.   The Democrats have used reapportionment as a means ofpushing back the tide before; they picked up seats in boththe state House and Senate in elections after the 1980census. &quot;Particularly in Florida,&quot; says Philip Blank, aTallahassee lawyer prominent in Democratic circles,&quot;redistricting is a purely political process.&quot;   This time Democrats expect elements of reapportionment,which won't be complete until next spring, to be part of thecomplicated horse-trading involving another politicallycharged issue, Florida's state budget. But an unpredictablefactor is new Gov. Lawton Chiles, who has a veto over anyplan. Though he is himself a Democrat, Mr. Chiles ran as anoutsider and has few allegiances to the legislature or to thestate's power centers.   And anything is possible in a state whose skyline includesthe 18-story Cinderella's Castle of Disney World. A decadeago, legislators drew a congressional district that nearlyeveryone agreed was a perfect political staging area forHouse Minority Leader Curt Kiser of Clearwater. He was sopleased with the district that he emerged from a meeting andtold his colleagues, &quot;Just call me congressman.&quot;   Except that when the voters got a chance to speak, Mr.Kiser lost the primary. &quot;I was the classic case of thesurprises that can happen with redistricting,&quot; says Mr.Kiser, now a state senator. &quot;If anyone ever had their name ona district, I sure did. It was made for me. . . .   &quot;I guess there's a lesson here.&quot;   ---                                                                                                          The changing face of Florida, 1970-2000                                                                                                                                 1970     1980     1990     2000*                                                                                                          Population   (in millions)           6.9      9.8     13.2     16.1                                                                                                          Population over 65   (in millions)           1.0      1.7      2.3      3.1                                                                                                          Jobs   (nonagricult.)          2.2      3.6      5.4      6.9                                                                                                          Per-Capita Income   (in '82 dollars)     $9,164  $11,317  $13,415  $15,261                                                                                                          *Projected   Source: University of Florida</TEXT></DOC>
