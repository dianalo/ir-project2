 There, your sensibilities don'treally take offense at seeing booths fronted with skimpily clad models orover-the-hill entertainers making fools of themselves reenacting their old TVshows.andP;  But you expect electronics vendors to display a little more decorumin the South.andM;Expectations,however, often fall short of reality.andP;  For instance, I can onlywonder at the reasoning behind some of the designers of Spring Comdex booths.andO;Comfort, ti seems, should account for something, especially in a climate ashot and humid a Atlanta's.andP;  (Even a well air-conditioned exhibit hall canstill by uncomfortably hot and steamy).andM;Speaking of comfort, what's wrong with wearing running shoes with a suit ifyou're going to be on your feet all day?andP;  Nothing, unless you're expected tobe on your best behavior, as those doing duty in exposition booths are.andP;  Onehad to pity the poor guys in one booth who all wore white tuxedos (actually,they're called &quot;dinner suits&quot;) and white patent leather shoes.andP;  Whoeveroutfitted these guys must have been a woman, one observer joked: It had to beher way of retaliating at men for creating high heels.andP;  No man would ever puthimself or a colleague in such uncomfortable shoes under the foot-killingcircumstances of a trade show, where standing in one place is the order ofthe day.andM;The appearance of Denver and Jenner in booths at Spring Comdex really seemsto represent low points in once illustrious careers.andP;  It's customary fornumerous exhibitors to show in-booth skits, generally using local, otherwiseunemployed actors, but often their employees.andP;  It's easy to forgive andforget the bad acting in these attempts at &quot;show&quot; business.andM;But you have to wonder about the fortunes of formerly well-knownpersonalities who appear in booths at such shows.andP;  Bruce Jenner might havehad a reasonable excuse for his appearance.andP;  Signing autographs for cash isall the rage now (many sports stars earn considerable amounts from it), andperhaps the 1976 Olympic decathlon champion has a long-term contract withOkidata, the Japanese firm whose booth he appeared in, that says he mustautograph photos of himself for a certain number of days each year.andM;On the other hand, Bob Denver's skit, titled &quot;How Gilligan was Rescued bySamsung,&quot; in the Samsung booth, was a sorry site.andP;  Although I didn't sitthrough the entire skit, it basically dealt with &quot;the difficulty ofpurchasing a personal computer in the 1990s world of corporate buyers.&quot;andM;The &quot;show&quot; mixed live action with filmed clips--some showing Denver/Gilliganon a beach--and seemed popular with Comdex visitors.andP;  From a distance, Denverstill resembles the likable nincompoop he portrayed on &quot;Gilligan's Island&quot; inthe 1960s.andP;  Up close, however, it's apparent the years have taken their toll,and there's no mistaking that Denver is no longer the typical young beachbum.andM;On a nontheatrical level, give-aways at Sherwood (a multi-colored digitalwatch) and Mitsubishi (similarly hued sunglasses) generated long lines.andP;  Thebest-kept secret at Comdex may have been the chocolate available in afish-bowl at LSI Logic's booth.andP;  These were only a few of the goodies youcould pick up, if you were willing to cart the stuff around afterward.andM;Attending the PartiesandM;What would any trade show, particularly Comdex, do without parties, or,&quot;hospitality suites,&quot; in the words of the invitations sent out by numberousvendors?andP;  Spring Comdex wasn't any different, unless you call a turn to thesouthern motif different.andM;Microsoft, for instance, rented an historic mansion in the ritzy Buckheaddistrict of Atlanta to show off its &quot;family portrait.&quot;andP;  This full-colorphotograph, complete with frame, pictured the packaging for its majorsoftware products, including the recently released Windows 3.0.andP;  The southernhospitality here included plenty of food (especially sweets), drinks, and thechance to stroll around the picturesque house and its grounds.andM;At another gathering for glad-handing, a public relations agency took overthe newly opened Bridgetown Grill in a far-away corner of Atlanta to serve upsome Carribean cooking, beer, and mingling between the media and the firm'sclients.andM;The most entertaining extracurricular Comdex event, in my opinion, was thrownby Digital Communications Assoc.andP;  (DCA) at Atlanta's renovated Fox Theater.andO;The Alpharetta, Ga., vendor of IRMALan products hired a three-piece combo andits Bessie Smith-like lead singer for an evening of jazz, soul, and gospelmusic.andM;How Many Calories .andP;  .  .?andM;Some random thoughts and observations while walking the aisles at the WorldCongress (Center (and the inforum):andM;* How many uninterruptible power supply vendors can the electronicsmarketplace support?andP;  Not as many as exhibited at Comdex, I'm certain.andP;  Whileall our PCs and networks need protection against power failures, there aren'tthat many of us to keep all these guys going financially.andM;* Can touch-screen capabilities for the Macintosh make the mouse disappear?andO;MicroTouch, a firm demonstrating software called Mac'n Touch, seems to thinkso.andP;  It had a large corner booth against the wall in the Inforum and drewconsiderable interest, evidenced by the crowds there.andM;* Does anyone listen to a presentation on the last day of Comdex?andM;* What do you do with a lopsided basketball you won in a free-throw shootingcontest at a Comdex booth?andP;  First, you carry the thing around all afternoon,wishing you had been less accurate.andP;  Then you probably give it away beforereturning to your hotal room.andM;* Are there really enough OS/2-based applications and their associated usersto support the newly inaugurated OS/2 Magazine, put out by The Silicon BeachOperations (Carpenteria, Calif.)?andP;  The publication's premier issue, featuringMicrosoft president and founder Bill Gates on its cover, debuted with 128pages, including a techie crossword puzzle.andM;* How many hours and/or minutes of walking through aisles in an exhibit halldoes it take to burn off the calorie-laced candies found at industry shows?andM;* Scheduling snafus aside, are Sunday openings a wave of the future for tradeshows?andP;  Surprisingly, Sunday's crowd was among the largest for the five-dayevent.andM;On to BusinessandM;Lest you think nothing was accomplished at this year's Comdex, a few vendorsdid introduce some interesting products.andP;  DCA, taking advantage of thehometown nature of Comdex, made the first one, hosting a Sunday morning pressconference in Atlanta's renovated Underground.andM;ATandamp;T relased a number of products, Thomas-Conrad announced the availabilityof its 100Mbps TCNS (Thomas-Conrad Networking System) alternative to FiberDistributed Data Interface (FDDI) products, and Xtree and Moses Computerreleased new versions of popular products.andM;Several other companies displayed new and/or revised products worth noting,including a small chip-chiller that can nearly double the performance of an80486 microprocessor and some network utility programs.andM;A Convertible NICandM;DCA gets an &quot;A&quot; for ingenuity with its IRMAtrac Token Ring network adaptercard (NIC), a 4/16 Mbps convertible board with edge connectors for both IBM'sMicro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, as well as the industry-standardarchitecture (ISA).andM;This allows users to purchase a single product for installation in IBM PCsand compatibles or PS/2 machines with the MCA.andP;  This way, a user who wants toconnect a PC or PC-compatible to a network now but plans to upgrade to a PS/2model 80 next year can buy the IRMAtrac now, plug the ISA-compatible side ofthe board into the PC bus, and connect it to a Token Ring workgroup.andP;  Then,when it's time to make the upgrade to a PS/2 MCA machine, the IRMAtrac NICcan simply be taken out of the PC, turned over, and plugged into the PS/2'sMCA bus.andM;DCA has also built in media-access flexibility by including exchangeable ringinterface modules (RIMs) with each board.andP;  These screwon modules can beeasily removed and installed, as DCA showed at its press conference.andP;  Thecompany says it will initially ship modules supporting shielded andunshielded twisted-pair wire, and it is developing a fiber-optic module aswell.andM;DCA's ingenuity in developing IRMAtrac is unquestioned; its ability topenetrate the IBM-dominated Token Ring marketplace, however, remainsundetermined.andP;  According to estimates made on the number of Token Ring chipsets sold to manufacturers of IBM-compatible Token Ring boards, Big Bluecontrols nearly 90 percent of the market.andP;  The remaining 10 percent is splitamong a host of vendors, including Madge Networks, Proteon, Western Digital,and 3Com.andM;Chris Carter, DCA's senior product manager in charge of the IRMAtrac,admitted that cracking IBM's stronghold will be difficult.andP;  DCA believes,however, that its huge installed base of IRMA boards at large corporatecustomers--&quot;We have over a million IRMA cards installed in corporateaccounts,&quot; he said--gives DCA a foothold into this market others don't have.andM;DCA said it had to develop a Token Ring product because technology &quot;isbecoming a large part of [DCA's customers'] networks--[Token Ring is] astrategic component in our corporate accounts.&quot;andP;  As such, DCA will sellIRMAtrac by stressing its ability to tap into the large IBM networks, notmerely on the strengths of the adapter board.andM;IRMAtrac can serve as a bus master in MCA and ISA computers, and aDCA-designed proprietary chip, called Versatile Interface Chip, or VIC,allows the board to automatically sense whether an ISA machine supports busmastering.andP;  It automatically enters the board into non-bus master mode whenthe PC does not support bus mastering.andM;Bus mastering allows a peripheral device such as an NIC to take directcontrol of a PC bus, bypassing the computer's CPU and speeding up datatransfer.andM;The IRMAtrac board offers 128KB of RAM for processing code onboard, includingthe 802.2 logical-link control protocol software.andP;  An onboard T1380C16communications chip processes this code, freeing the PC's CPU to do otherwork.andM;Carter said beta testing had proven IRMAtrac to be 25 to 30 percent fasterthan existing Token Ring products, primarily IBM's.andP;  He also said IRMAtrac&quot;has more options than IBM's&quot; while retailing for the same price, $895.andM;When available this fall, IRMAtrac will ship with drivers for Novell'sNetWare 2.1x and NetWare 386; 3Com's 3+Open version of the LAN Manager; DCA'sown 10Net Plus, IBM's PC LAN Program, OS/2 Extended Edition and LAN Server,and Microsoft's shrink-wrapped version of the LAN Manager for machines suchas Compaq's Systempro.andM;ATandamp;T's LAN BlitzandM;ATandamp;T's Computer Systems division capitalized on IBM's absence to release twodozen network-related products, including three high-end servers that offermultiprocessing and, in one case, fault-tolerant capabilities.andM;In particular, ATandamp;T turned up the heat on the Unix-versus-OS/2 server marketwith the release of three Star-Servers, ranging in price from $27,500 to$172,000.andP;  These servers will eventually support the symmetricalmultiprocessor version (Release 4.0.3) of ATandamp;T's Unix System V operatingsystem (OS).andM;Although neither Unix nor OS/2 has a stronghold on the network server OSmarket, analysts predict strong growth in this area, particularly for Unix,fueled in part by federal government interests.andP;  Staking claim to the serverOS is a key issue among network vendors because most end users tend to matchthe client with the server.andP;  OS/2's viability as a server OS against the moreestablished Unix, developed by ATandamp;T's Bell Labs, is still in question; hence,ATandamp;T's push to gain market share.andM;ATandamp;T's new machines also cranked up the pace in the multiprocessor servermarket.andP;  The early entrants into this field--Compaq's Systempro and NetFrameSystem's NetFrame--have yet to make major inroads into corporate networks.andO;ATandamp;T, however, with its ready-made customer base, is in a strong position tobe successful where Compaq and NetFrame have failed.andM;The new servers, which come in two models--the StarServer E and StarServer FT(fault tolerance)--can run both Unix, including the multiprocessor versiondue later this year, and ATandamp;T's Unix LAN Manager.andM;The Intel i486-based StarServer E comes in three configurations, priced from$27,500 to $39,900.andP;  It can run one to four processors, access up to 16MB ofRAM, and support up to 1.6GB of disk storage.andP;  This machine features truesymmetrical multiprocessing, eventually offering 106 mips of power in afour-CPU configuration.andM;Initial shipments will be single-processor versions, according to ATandamp;T, thatwill support DOS clients under ATandamp;T's Simultask application.andM;The StarServer FT, based on the Mips R2000 reduced instruction set computing(RISC) CPU, can support three processors, up to 40MB of RAM, and up to two295MB hard disks.andP;  This system is the result of ATandamp;T's alliance with TandemComputers, known for its fault-tolerant mainframe systems.andM;The StarServer FT offers what ATandamp;T calls triple modular redundancy (TMR), inwhich three processors act as one.andP;  After each RISC processor independentlyexecutes the same instructions, the results are sent to a &quot;voter logic&quot;module in the replicated TMR controllers.andP;  If one processor's results deviatefrom the others', it is automatically taken offline, and the other twocontinue to operate at full capacity.andM;ATandamp;T also released two desktop systems, including the ATandamp;T 6386SX/EL WGS,which can be used as a client or standalone PC, and the ATandamp;T 6386/25 WGSSmall Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) server, based on the 80386 CPU.andP;  Thelatter machine is part of ATandamp;T's Model S family and can support up to 32users.andM;ATandamp;T also announced availability and pricing for its PMX/StarMail Release 2.2e-mail product.andP;  Prices for the new release range from $395 for eight-userlicenses to $1,900 for an unlimited number of users.andM;100Mbps TCNSandM;Thomas-Conrad (Austin, Texas) used Spring Comdex to demonstrate and announcethat its new 100Mbps TCNS products are shipping.andP;  The company says TCNS &quot;is alogical extension of existing token-passing LAN technologies that provides atrue 100Mbps effective data rate and requires no new specialized software.&quot;andO;Star topology-based TCNS networks are made up of a Smart Hub and TCNSadapters connected via fiber-optic cable.andP;  They support up to 255 users overa 20,000-foot cable run.andM;TCNS is ideal for computer-aided design/engineering, electronic publishing,and graphics/digital imaging environments, according to a spokesperson.andM;Thomas-Conrad now ships ISA and EISA versions of its adapter, and TCNSsupports Novell's NetWare, Banyan's VINES, Artisoft's LANtastic, WesternDigital's Vianet, and Performance Technology's PowerLAN.andM;XTree's XTreeNetandM;NetWare network administrators will find XTree's (San Luis Obispo, Calif.)andO;XTreeNet 2.0 extremely useful.andP;  Like previous versions of XTree, XTreeNetprovides a graphical &quot;tree&quot; display of a disk drive's directory structure.andO;This display makes it easy to manipulate the files and subdirectories on thedrive.andM;The NetWare-aware version also offers peer-to-peer capabilities that allow anetwork administrator to access any workstation on the network.andP;  XTreeNetlets the network administrators copy, delete, or edit files anywhere on theirnetwork from a central location.andM;Other network-specific features of XTreeNet include the abilities to displayand modify all NetWare information associated with directories and files, mapnetwork drives across one computer to another, and send the output from anyprogram to any printer on the network.andP;  XTreeNet enhances NetWare's securityfeatures by allowing the supervisor to restrict access and use of theXTreeNet commands to users or groups based on their needs within a particulardirectory.andM;XTreeNet sells for $249 for NetWare ELS (levels I and II) and $495 for theAdvanced/SFT/386 versions.andP;  Registered XTreeNet 1.0 users can upgrade toeither version for $95.andM;Other Comdex NewsandM;Banyan Systems (Westboro, Mass.) and VIA Information Systems (Princeton,N.J.) announced that they have shipped the VIA for VINES database server.andO;VIA for VINES, available from VIA Information Services, was ported from theformer's VIA/DRE (for Distributed Relational Environment) using Banyan'sVINES Application Toolkit.andP;  VIA/DRE is a distributed SQL (Structured QueryLanguage) database server.andM;GVC Technologies (Sparta, N.J.) introduced its LANode 386SX, a disklessnetwork workstation based on the 80386SX processor.andP;  The LANode 386SX,one-third the size of an IBM AT, is available in 12 preconfigured versionsfor Arcnet, Ethernet, or Token Ring operation.andP;  The LANode 386SX stationsretail for $1,625 to $1,995.andP;  A disk option at $199 is also available.andM;Velox Computer Technology (Santa Clara, Calif.) claims its new ICECapproducts allow microprocessors to operate at 50 percent faster clock ratesthan normal.andM;According to Velox, the ICECap 486, the company's first integrated circuit,environmentally controlled (ICEC) component, lowers the Intel 80486'soperating temperature to 0 degrees Celsius and precisely controls the chip'svoltage.andP;  This combination enables the 33 MHz 486 to operate at 50 MHz,according to Velox.andM;&quot;For years, it's been understood that cooling computer components deliversfaster clock speeds--that's why supercomputers are packed in freon,&quot; saysVelox president Mel Snyder.andP;  ICECap brings this technology to PC-levelproducts such as file servers and high-end PCs.andM;The ICECap 486 is priced at about $150 in OEM quantities without a CPU.andM;Frye Computer Systems (Boston) also premiered its Frye Utilities forNetworks--NetWare Early Warning System (NEWS) at Comdex.andP;  According tocompany spokesmen, the product polls NetWare servers, then automaticallynotifies the network administrator when problems occur.andM;NEWS checks more than 50 operating parameters during each polling cycle,which can be set for varying intervals.andP;  When a parameter limit, such as diskspace use, is reached, NEWS sends a warning message to the systemadministrator, and the problem is explained in an error log that can be savedto a local disk.andM;NEWS also checks and reports on cache errors, invalid network connections,file-allocation table (FAT) errors, hard disk controller errors, and lostpackets.andM;Frye is offering NEWS at half price to all previous purchasers of the FryeNetwork Utilities--NetWare Management program.andP;  The Windows 3.0-compatibleNEWS normally retails for $295 for a single-server license.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
