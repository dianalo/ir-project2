On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, finished 62cents lower at $19.95 a barrel. The drop retraced most of the 69cents the contract had gained since last Friday's $19.88 close.   Other contract months showed smaller declines.   Among refined products, unleaded gasoline for July deliverydropped 1.30 cents to 58.14 cents a gallon, while July heating oilfell 0.55 cent to 45.71 cents a gallon. Other product contracts alsodeclined.   Analysts said the market had been overbought in recent days.   ``You're bound to see profit-taking coming in basically as aresult of it,'' said Nauman Barakat, vice president of energyinvestments at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Some observers had attributed the recent rise in July crude oilto concerns about pipeline distribution problems that resulted insome customers receiving foreign crude in place of West TexasIntermediate.   Although the delivered crude met specifications, customers usedto receiving West Texas Intermediate were concerned about supplies,analysts said.   ``The short-term scare is over,'' said James Steel, an analystwith Refco Inc. ``That led to a relaxation in the market and madethe market go down.''</TEXT></DOC>
