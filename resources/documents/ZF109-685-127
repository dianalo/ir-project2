Well, European production runs, to no one*s surprise here, remainsfragmented and fraught with political intrigues while at the same time theruns are shorter than in the U.S.andP;  Future economic impact will be determinedby two factors, the Commission argued -- its impact on the audio-visualsector and its effect in improving efficiency vastly on a European scalethrough new point-to-multipoint communications services distributed bysatellites.andP;  Both these sectors, if explored well, could add a whopping 20 bnECU to Europe's economy in the period to the year 2000, the Commissionfigured, if existing restrictions are lifted.andM;However, satellite communications will still only correspond to 1.5 to 2.5percent of total telecommunications services revenues in Europe by the end ofthis century.andM;In 1990, Europe totalled 32 satellites with a footprint large enough to coverthe 12-nation Community (and states lucky to fall into this area) out ofwhich 15 were of European origin.andP;  Total transponder capacity stands at 350of which INTELSAT takes 48 percent and its European smaller brother EUTELSATcontrols another 23 percent.andP;  If all goes as planned, satellite capacity isexpected to more than double by 1993.andM;(Eric Dauchy/19902611)</TEXT></DOC>
