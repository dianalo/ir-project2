There were no reports, however, of any drug cartel bossesarrested in the emergency crackdown, which follows theassassinations of a leading presidential candidate, a nationalpolice colonel and a magistrate.   In renewed guerrilla attacks, eight policemen and two peasantswere killed, police and news reports said today.   Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the 46-year-old Liberal Party candidate,was buried Sunday after hundreds of thousands of people took to thestreets in a public display of grief.   Meanwhile, thousands of judges and magistrates who walked off thejob last week to protest inadequate security from hitmen hired bydrug traffickers have called off the strike to join the fight, aspokesman said.   The Defense Ministry today reported 10,450 people detained in 321raids nationwide. Ministry communiques said 622 weapons were seizedas well as 1,023 vehicles. Four tons of cocaine paste also werereported confiscated.   Among the sites raided were buildings and ranches in and aroundthe city of Medellin that are owned by Pablo Escobar, reputed to beone of the world's biggest cocaine traffickers.   According to the ministry, at one ranch owned by Escobar,military forces detained 52 people and seized 2,000 head of cattle,100 pigs, 3,000 gallons of gasoline and several cars and trucks.   Properties owned by the family of Jorge Ochoa and by GonzaloRodriguez Gacha, two other top reputed cocaine dealers, also wereraided, the ministry said.   Galan was gunned down at a political rally in Soacha, a town 20miles south of Bogota. His killing capped a wave of drug-relatedassassinations that also included a national police colonel inMedellin and a Bogota magistrate.   Later Friday, President Virgilio Barco declared a state of siegeand announced emergency decrees empowering the government tosummarily extradite drug traffickers, several of whom are sought bythe United States on smuggling charges.   He also gave police extraordinary powers to arrest and seize theproperty of suspected dealers, stiffened penalties and establishedspecial protection for the country's judges.   Speaking at Galan's funeral in a packed central cathedral, Barcodeclared: ``We pray to God to give each of us, each Colombian, allthe courage and all the fortitude that we need to face the challengeof terrorism.   ``Once again, this time moved by sadness, I call forinternational solidarity to fight this international organization,''he said. He called the cocaine underworld ``a gigantic and powerfulorganization such has never existed in the world'' and describedColombia as ``its biggest victim.''   Galan had survived previous attempts on his life. Police saiddrug traffickers offered $500,000 for his death.   About 400,000 people lined the three-mile route from thecathedral to the central cemetery where Galan was buried. They wavedcampaign banners and many wept openly and cried out loud forjustice. Campaign billboards, with Galan's smiling image, werebordered in black.   At the cemetery, as the coffin was lowered, thousands ofColombians chanted, ``Galan is still here!''   In a funeral sermon, Roman Catholic Cardinal Mario Revollo Bravodeclared, ``The country is morally ill,'' but he vowed: ``The nationwill not succumb to a handful of criminals.''   The drug cartels announced Saturday they would step up violencein a bid to force the government to negotiate with them, althoughthey have never publicly stated their demands in detail.   In a communique released to radio stations and signed ``TheExtraditables'' _ a reference to those drug leaders wanted in theUnited States _ the cartels said ``now the fight is with blood.''   The country's 4,500 judges and magistrates, who went on strikeafter the assassination Thursday of Bogota Magistrate CarlosVelenica Garcia, announced plans to end the protest on Tuesday whencourts reopen after a regular holiday today.   ``It's not the time for strikes or resignations,'' said JudgeJose Gabriel Salom, president of the Bogota Superior Court. He and47 colleagues presented their resignations, but Salom said theywould be withdrawn.   Scores of judges prosecuting drug cases often have beenassassinated, and the strike and resignations were intended todramatize what the courts felt was a lack of security.   In the province of Huila south of Bogota, leftist guerrillasambushed a police truck on a highway, killing eight officers andpossibly kidnapping two others, local news reports said today.   A police statement published by Bogota newspapers blamed theattack on the Revolutionary Armed Forces, one of several leftistguerrilla groups operating in the country.   The ten police were driving about 90 miles south of Bogota when aguerrilla bomb was detonated, the reports said. The guerrillas thensprayed the truck with automatic weapon fire.   Authorities reportedly found the bodies of the eight policemen atthe site, and the two others were missing and believed kidnapped.   In a separate attack, guerrillas raided a small village near thetown of Palestina, about 240 miles south of Bogota, and killed twopeasants, police said.</TEXT></DOC>
