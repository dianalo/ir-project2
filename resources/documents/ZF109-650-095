 A standard VGA display canproduce 262,144 different shades but can only display 16 colorssimultaneously; the PRISM palette editor lets users reassign DOSattributes to any color.andP;  The palette-editing screen shows the 16current DOS color attributes in squares of color across the top ofthe screen and has a frame of slider bars for controlling thelevels of the color values in the active color.andP;  Users can editpalettes either with the mouse or with the cursor keys.andP;  Theprogram has three user-selectable default settings for soundeffects, mouse reaction speed and the rate at which one palettedissolves into the next.andP;  PRISM also has an Undo command and theability to swap color pairs.andP;  Instructions for using the programare given.andP;  PRISM.EXE can be downloaded from the PC MagNetcomputer bulletin board.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     ColorVGA StandardDisplaysTutorialProgramming Instruction.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Free Your VGA From CGA Captivity With PRISM.EXE Surely you'll agree that it'sabsurd to buy a high-resolution VGA monitor, capable of displaying thousandsof attractive colors, and then settle for entering your text in the 16 garishcolors of the original CGA card.andP;  Yet this is exactly what most users do.andO;Against a black screen, your colored letters look like flashy neon signs,while other backgrounds take you straight down the road into Toon Town.andP;  Andusing a white or light gray background is certainly no more appealing, as itcreates about as much eyestrain and user fatigue as staring at a light bulb.andM;The solution to these color problems is PRISM, a VGA palette editor andloader you can use with either mouse or keyboard.andP;  PRISM lets you reassignthe 16 DOS attributes to any of the 262,144 different shades the VGA displaycan produce.andP;  With this utility, you can transmute the annoyingly bright DOScolors into quieter hues and gentle pastels, saving the palettes you like inshort (51-byte) .PAL files you can load--with PRISM--from the DOS prompt.andP;  Asyou play with the values of each color on your display, you'll quicklydiscover which colors work well together and which don't.andP;  With a littleexperimentation, not only will the improvement in readability be apparent,but you'll find that programs running on your VGA monitor will be much moreattractive and far easier to look at for prolonged periods of time.andM;You can download a ready-to-run copy of PRISM.EXE, together with a number ofsample palettes, from PC MagNet; instructions are given in the sidebar &quot;PRISMby Modem.&quot;andP;  The program is written in Turbo Pascal and uses additionalfunctions from TurboPower's Object Professional library.andP;  The complete sourcecode, together with a programmer's README file are also available and can bedownloaded from PC MagNet as well.andP;  But all you really need, to takeadvantage of PRISM, is a system running DOS 3.0 (or later), a VGA display,and at least 256K of free RAM.andM;USING PRISMandM;The PRISM command syntax is simplyandM;PRISM [palette name]andM;If you specify the name of a predefined palette (you don't have to type inthe .PAL extension) on the DOS command line when loading PRISM, the colors ofthe previously active palette will dissolve smoothly into those of the namedpalette.andP;  If you don't specify a palette initially, PRISM will enter itsediting mode with whatever color scheme is in effect.andP;  Note that PRISM savesthe underlying DOS (text mode) screen even if set to display an expandednumber of rows and columns.andP;  When you exist PRISM, the editing screen willfade out and the previous DOS screen will fade back in, but with the newcolor palette active.andM;When the palette-editing screen fades in, the 16 current DOS color attributesappear in squares of color across the top of the screen.andP;  The two rows ofeight squares each are laid out as shown in Figure 1.andP;  As you will see thefirst time you bring up the PRISM editing screen, in the original CGAdisplay, the color values assigned to the attributes are as follows:andM;0 = black 1 = blue 2 = green 3 = cyan 4 = red 5 = magenta 6 = brown 7 = gray8 = dark gray 9 = light blue 10 = light green 11 = light cyan 12 = light red13 = light magenta 14 = yellow 15 = whiteandM;Below the 16 attribute squares is a larger, rectangular color block.andP;  This isthe active color, the one currently being edited and its corresponding colorsquare above is outlined.andP;  On either side of the active color block are apair of three-line reminder messages.andM;Below the active color block is a frame of five slide bars.andP;  These controlthe levels of the color values in the active color.andP;  The top and bottomsliders control saturation and intensity, which are discussed in more detailin the sidebar &quot;Saturation and Intensity.&quot;andP;  The interior three sliderscontrol the levels of red, green, and blue in the active color.andP;  Mixed invarying proportions, these three primary colors create every color in the VGAspectrum.andP;  (The relationship between the CGA, EGA, and VGA colors isdiscussed in the sidebar &quot;About the Video Graphics Array.&quot;)  The sliderlabels are on the left side of the slider frame; on the right side are thenumerical values of each slider level.andM;Below the slider frame is a highlighted menu bar and a help line thatprovides one-line descriptions of each highlighted menu item.andP;  Additionalhelp on each menu item is available by pressing F1, which will pop open atext window containing further information.andP;  The PgUp and PgDn keys will moveyou through the help text.andM;When the help window is open, an additional press of the F1 key will bring upthe help index, which contains several items not otherwise accessible.andP;  Youcan either move the highlighted menu bar to the item on the index you wantand press Enter or move the mouse cursor to the index item and click the leftmouse button.andP;  You can also access the help index at any time, simply bypressing F1 twice.andP;  To exit the help window and return to the program, pressEsc or click the right mouse button.andM;USING THE CURSOR KEYSandM;There are two ways to edit a PRISM palette: with the cursor keys and with themouse.andP;  (If you don't have a mouse installed on your computer, inappropriateoptions on the submenus will be blanked out.)andP;  When editing with the keypad,the important thing to remember is that it has two distinct modes: NumLock ONand NumLock OFF.andP;  With the NumLock ON, the keypad is a number pad.andP;  With theNumLock OFF, the keypad is a cursor keypad.andM;PRISM uses the cursor keypad for selecting items from the menu and the numberkeypad for editing the VGA palette.andP;  You can toggle between menu mode andpalette-editing mode by pressing the NumLock key.andP;  You can also access thenonactive mode at any time by pressing either Shift key while simultaneouslypressing the desired keypad key.andM;If your keyboard has separate cursor and number keypads, PRISM will respondto the cursor keypad for menu selection and to the number keypad for paletteediting.andP;  You will have to set NumLock ON.andM;The PRISM menu works like those of most popular software packages.andP;  The RightArrow cursor key moves the highlighted bar to the right, and the Left Arrowkey moves it to the left.andP;  You hit Enter to select a menu item.andP;  If a submenuappears, the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys move you up and down on thesubmenu, and you press Enter to select the appropriate item.andM;Alternatively, you can select any menu option by pressing the highlightedcharacter in its name.andP;  When a submenu is activated, you can select anysubmenu option by pressing the highlighted character of its name.andP;  Thus, forexample, you would press H(elp), then K(eypad) to read the help text onediting a palette with the cursor keys.andP;  You can cancel any menu operationsimply by hitting Esc.andM;Use Ctrl--Left Arrow or Ctrl--Right Arrow to select a color for editing.andP;  Theoutline box at the top of the screen will move to show the active color,which is simultaneously displayed in the large color rectangle in the centerof the screen.andP;  You can also press Ctrl-Home to toggle the color selectorbetween the rows of color squares.andP;  Note that the Ctrl-shifted keys switchamong color squares when you use either the cursor or the number keypad.andM;Still using the keyboard, after selecting the color attribute to edit, youselect the quality to change (saturation, red, green, blue, intensity) withthe Up or Down Arrows of the number keypad.andP;  The selector on the left side ofthe frame will move to show the currently active slider bar.andP;  You then pressthe number-pad Right or Left Arrow to adjust the level of that quality up ordown.andP;  If the sound effects are on (the default), you will hear a rising orfalling musical tone.andM;Experiment with changing all five qualities of a specific color and you'lleasily understand what each one does.andP;  Red, Green, and Blue adjust the levelof each primary color component in the currently active attribute.andP;  AlthoughSaturation and intensity seem to control the amount of white and black mixedinto each shade, their actual functions are just a little bit more subtle andare more fully explained in the &quot;Saturation and Intensity&quot; sidebar.andM;USING A MOUSE WITH PRISMandM;If you have a mouse installed on your computer, PRISM will sense its presenceand activate the mouse-submenu items.andP;  Although you could still use thecursor and number keypads for menu selection and palette editing, you'llalmost certainly find it easier to use the mouse.andM;The behavior of the mouse matches the standard industry conventions.andP;  Movethe mouse until the mouse cursor is at the desired point on the screen, thenclick the left mouse button.andP;  Clicking the mouse when the cursor is on a &quot;hotspot&quot; triggers the function linked to that screen location, whether it be amenu or submenu option or a quantity on the editing frame.andP;  If the mouse ison one of the five lines of the frame, clicking it will move the associatedslider to that exact point and the color will be changed accordingly.andM;You can also &quot;brab&quot; a slider button by moving the mouse cursor atop it andholding the left mouse button down.andP;  This allows you to drag the slider alongthe bar with the mouse, changing the associated value as you go.andP;  The effectcan range from subtle to striking.andM;SETTING YOUR DEFAULTSandM;PRISM has three user-selectable default settings.andP;  You can toggle the soundeffects on or off, adjust the reaction speed of the mouse, and reset the rateat which one color palette dissolves into the next.andP;  These settings are allselected from a submenu that appears when you select the Options item fromthe main menu.andP;  (If you do not have a mouse installed on your computer, theMouse Speed item on the submenu will be blanked out.)andP;  The current state oofeach of the resettable defaults will be displayed next to the item name, andy ou can simply cycle through its range of possible values.andM;The Options submenu differs in one respect from the other PRISM submenus: itdoes not automatically erase when an item is selected.andP;  Choosing an item onthe Options submenu changes the state of the item but leaves the submenudisplayed.andP;  To erase the Options submenu, press Esc or click the right mousebutton.andP;  Clicking the mouse on another item on the main menu (or selecting itwith the cursory keypad Left or Right Arrow keys) will also remove theOptions submenu and pop-up the new item's submenu instead.andM;By default, Prism provides sound effects to let you know that an action hasoccurred.andP;  Audible key clicks are produced wheneve a color is selected forediting and whenever an operation has been selected or concluded.andP;  This iswhy the first mouse-click on a color will produce an audible key-click, butnot the second.andP;  Clicking on any of the sliders triggers a musical beep, anddragging a slider produces a rising or falling musical tone.andP;  Opening orclosing a help window also creates a sound effect.andP;  If you find the soundeffects distracting, you can toggle them off from the Options/Sound Effectsmenu item.andM;Some people like a fast mouse cursor, one that travels a great distance inresponse to a very small hand movement.andP;  Others prefer a slower mouse, whichis less responsive to their hand movements so that they can control it moreprecisely.andP;  Prism lets you set the mouse response rate to any of four speeds:Slow, Normal (the default), Fast, and Zoom!andP;  The current setting is alwaysdisplayed to the right of the Mouse Speed item under the Options menu, and itchanges by one step each time you select the option.andM;One of PRISM's most interesting effects is the way it dissolves from onecolor palette to another  The dissolve is accomplished by computing thedifference between the two palettes and the number of steps it will take tochange the values in one palette into the values in the other.andP;  Then thevalues necessary for a single step are added (or subtracted) to the VGAregisters.andP;  This is is repeated for as many steps as it takes to complete thedissolve.andM;You can change the amount of time it takes to dissolve from one color toanother by increasing or decreasing the number of steps displayed.andP;  This isset from the Options/Dissolve Rate item, which cycles from 0 to 36, inincrements of 6 steps each time the option is selected.andP;  The default numberof steps is 18, which I find is just about the right speed for a 16-MHzmachine using a 386SX processor.andP;  Users with slower or faster machines maywish to increase or decrease the dissolve rate.andM;Increasing the number to 30 or 36 will noticeably slow the rate of thedissolve; however, it will make it smoother.andP;  Decreasing it to 12 or 6 willsignificantly speed up the change.andP;  If you would prefer an instant switchbetween palettes, simply set the number of steps to 0 and the program willpop directly to the new palette every time a change is requested.andM;Whenever you change any of the PRISM defaults, the new setting becomes activeimmediately.andP;  The PRISM.CFG file will be automatically updated when you exitthe program, and the next time you use PRISM, the defaults will reflect thenew settings.andP;  If there is no PRISM.CFG file, PRISM will create one.andM;PALETTE MENU OPERATIONSandM;The Palette item on the main menu accesses five useful palette-editingcommands: undo a previous change, swap two colors, restore the originalsystem palette, randomly generate a new palette, and duplicate one color ontop of another.andP;  Each command can be selected by any of the usual menuoperations: clicking with the mouse, pressing Enter, or pressing thehighlighted character in the name.andP;  Additionally, each Palette command has ashortcut Ctrl-key (displayed with the item on the submenu) that executes thecommand directly rather than from the menu.andM;The first item on the Palette submenu is the Undo command.andP;  The very easewith which PRISM lets you change colors carries with it the potential formessing up as well as for improving your color display.andP;  Thus Undo may be themost important command in the editor.andM;PRISM actually gives you four different ways to Undo a mistake.andP;  You canselect P(alette)/U(Undo) from the main menu; you can click the right mousebutton; you can press Esc; or you can press Ctrl-U.andP;  When you execute theUndo operation, your last color change will be annullted, dissolving smoothlyback into the previously active palette.andP;  PRISM stores the current paletteand the last 15 color changes in an Undo stack memory, so you cansuccessively click your way back through as many as 15 different colorchanges.andP;  When you get to the bottom palette on the stack, PRISM returns tothe top, thus letting you cycle through a history of changes and return toyour last active palette.andM;The Undo button is also a cancel button.andP;  If there is an operation (such as acolor swap) currently pending that you decide not to complete, you can clickthe right mouse button, press Esc, or hit Ctrl-U to cancel it.andP;  The&quot;Operation pending&quot; message will disappear and the screen will resume itsnormal appearance.andM;Because DOS accesses its attributes by number, the assignment of a color to aspecific attribute number (position) is very important.andP;  The second item onthe Palette menu lets you assign any color you want to any attribute positionsimply by swapping it into place.andP;  For example, you might want to put analready existing dark blue into position 0 to use it as the background foryour palette.andM;To use the mouse to swap a pair of colors, first click on the color you wantto move, making it the currently active color.andP;  The outline box will move tothat position and the large color block will change to that color.andP;  Now movethe cursor onto the large (rectangular) color block and click again.andP;  Two&quot;Operation pending&quot; messages will appear, one on the left side of the blockand one on the right.andP;  Move the cursor to the target attribute position forthe active color and click on it.andP;  The two colors will change places on theattribute display and the &quot;Operation pending&quot; messages will disappear.andP;  Ifyou make a mistake in your targeting, simply execute the Undo command(Ctrl-U) and you'll be back where you started.andM;To swap a color pair from the keyboard, you must first select the color to bemoved with the Ctrl-Left Arrow or Ctrl--Right Arrow keys.andP;  Then activate thePalette/Swap command from the main menu (or by pressing Ctrl-S).andP;  The&quot;Operation pending&quot; messages will again appear.andP;  Now move the outline box tothe target position with the Ctrl-Arrow keys.andP;  If you now reexecute thePalette/Swap command (Ctrl-S), the interchange will be made and the screenwill return to normal.andM;Sometimes, however, undoing one change--or even the last 15 changes!--is notenough.andP;  Sometimes you've gotten so far from where you started that you'rehopelessly lost and your system's color display has become totallyunreadable.andP;  That's what the third item on the Palette menu is for.andM;When PRISM begins operation, the first thing it does is store a copy of thecolor palette currently active on your system.andP;  You can reset to this paletteat any point in your editing session by executing the Restore command, whichcan be activated in three different ways: by selecting the Palette/Restorecommand from the main menu; by pressing Ctrl-R (the shortcut key); or byclicking both mouse buttons simultaneously.andP;  Note, however, that if you exitPRISM without restoring the original palette, the palette active on theediting screen will remain in effect when you return to the DOS command line.andO;This new palette will thus become the &quot;currently active&quot; palette when youbring PRISM up again.andP;  If you want to get back, then, be sure to restorebefore exiting, or save your original palette as a named .PAL file, asexplained below.andM;PRISM's fourth Palette menu command generates New color palettes by pokingrandom numbers between 0 and 63 into a set of attribute positions.andO;Generally, most of these random palettes will look pretty awful: good colorcombinations rarely happen by accident.andP;  Occasionally, however, PRISM willcome up with a palette combination that can be edited or adjusted intosomething pleasing.andP;  Moreover, if nothing else, the random palettes can giveyou some idea of the range of colors possible on the VGA screen.andM;There are three ways to create a random palette: you can select thePalette/New command from the main menu; you can press Ctrl-N, the shortcutkey; or you can double-click the left mouse button on the currently activeattribute box.andP;  Note that PRISM interprets two clicks as a double-click ifthey occur within one-third of a second.andM;When designing or editing a color palette, you'll often find it useful tocopy a color into a second attribute slot and then alter its Saturation orIntensity value to create a lighter or darker shade of the same basic color.andO;This is one of the best ways to design a pleasing combination of relatedshades.andP;  Duplicate--the final command on the Palette menu--lets you replicateany color in any position.andM;Duplicating a color is very similar to swapping a color.andP;  If you're using themouse, first click on the color you want to copy.andP;  As before, the outline boxwill move to that color and the rectangular, currently active attribute boxwill change to show that color.andM;Move the cursor onto the large attribute box, but this time instead ofclicking on it (as you do for swapping), hold down the left mouse button anddrag the cursor to the target square before releasing it.andP;  Note that only thecursor, not the box, will actually move during the drag operation, but whilethe mouse button is held down the &quot;Operation pending&quot; message will indicatethat a duplication, not a swap, is pending.andP;  When you now release the mousecursor atop the target square, you'll find that you've duplicated the sourcecolor at the target position.andP;  You can then edit the copy to make it darkeror lighter or to alter the relative levels of its primary color components.andO;Note that the Undo command works here, too.andM;Using the keyboard to duplicate a color is again similar to the swapprocedure.andP;  Use the Ctrl-Left Arrow or Ctrl--Right Arrow key to move theoutline box to the color you want to duplicate.andP;  Then select thePalette/Duplicate command from the menu or hit Ctrl-D, which will produce thesame result.andP;  The outline box will change color and the &quot;Operation pending&quot;messages will flash to show you that a duplication is pending.andM;Now use the Ctrl-Left Arrow or Ctrl--Right Arrow again to move the outlinebox to the target color square, and select the Palette/Duplicate command (orCtrl-D) a second time.andP;  The color of the first square will be instantlymapped onto the second square, and the editor will be ready for your nextoperation.andM;LOADING AND SAVING PALETTES TO DISKandM;After designing the perfect VGA color display, you'll naturally want to saveit to disk so that you can use it again later.andP;  Simply select the Save optionfrom the main menu, by clicking on it with the mouse or by moving the menubar with the cursor keys and pressing Enter.andP;  Even more simply, just press S.andM;If you have previously loaded or saved a palette, PRISM will open a dialogbox to ask whether you want to save your current palette under the namestored in its PRISM.CFG file.andP;  If you enter N(o), you'll be prompted for anew name.andP;  (You need not enter the .PAL extension; PRISM will supply that.)andO;If you enter Y(es), PRISM will look to see whether the file is still on yourdisk.andP;  If it is, or if the &quot;new&quot; name you select is already being used,you'll be asked whether you want to overwrite the existing file, thusprotecting your previous work.andM;PRISM can load but cannot overwrite read-only .PAL files.andP;  For fullprotection, therefore, you can lock a valuable palette file by making itread-only; check your DOS manual or use a utility such as Charles Petzold'sATTR.COM (PC Magazine, June 10, 1986).andM;PRISM will not accept filenames that designate active devices.andP;  You cannotsave a palette to a file named CON or AUX or NUL or any other name currentlyin use as a device driver.andP;  Note also that any attempt to write a palettefile to a device instead of to a disk file produces no useful result and maypossibly hang up your machine.andM;Sometimes you may wish to see how a palette looks on your system before yousave it.andP;  You can exit PRISM, leaving the new palette active, and run yourprogram to see what it looks like.andP;  If you like the result, bring PRISM upagain and select the S(ave) option as you normally would.andP;  PRISM always bootsup displaying the palette currently active on the system, so you can savethat palette for future use if you have not already done so.andP;  When you dosave the file, PRISM will post a confirmation message, and the next time youselect PRISM's Load option, the palette you have saved will appear in PRISM'spicklist window.andM;As indicated previously, PRISM can load the contents of a named .PAL filedirectly into the VGA registers, when the program itself is executed at theDOS command line.andP;  In this event PRISM's editing mode is simply bypassed.andM;To load a palette for editing, simply bring up PRISM without specifying afilename and select the L(oad) option from the main menu, using either themouse or the cursor keys.andP;  A pick-list window will appear that shows all yourcurrently available PRISM palette files.andP;  You can highlight one of these witheither the mouse or the cursor keys; a second click of the mouse or pressingEnter will then load it and close the window.andM;Another way to load a palette is by starting to type in its name.andP;  I say&quot;starting to type&quot; advisedly, for PRISM uses a smart pick list.andP;  As you typethe letters of the palette name, the highlight bar will go instantly to thefirst name on the list that matches what you type.andP;  (Alternatively, you canhit the first letter of the name repeatedly and the highlight bar will cyclethrough all palette names that begin with that letter.)andP;  When the highlightbar is on the palette you wish to load, press Enter.andP;  The pick-list windowwill vanish and PRISM will dissolve the currently active palette into the newpalette you have selected.andM;If you decide not to load a new palette after all, you can abort the loadoperation from the pick-list window by pressing Esc or clicking the rightmouse button.andP;  The pick-list window will erase itself from the screen withoutloading a new palette and return you to PRISM's editing mode.andM;EXITING PRISMandM;As a safety precaution, PRISM requires two separate keystrokes (or two mouseclicks) to exit.andP;  You must select Q(uit)/Y(es) on the main menu to return toDOS.andP;  If you accidentally select Q(uit), you can abort the operation bypressing Esc, clicking the right mouse button, or by selecting the N(o)option on the submenu.andP;  Note that if you're normally running DOS in otherthan 25-line text mode, PRISM will restore you to that mode, and when youexit, the last palette active on the screen will be the new active palettefor DOS.andM;COMPATIBILITY ISSUESandM;PRISM is smart enough to find itself on your hard disk, no matter where youstore it.andP;  You can put PRISM in a subdirectory with the rest of yourutilities or you can ensconce it, together with its .PAL files, in its ownsubdirectory.andP;  In the latter case you won't have to list the subdirectory onthe DOS path if you simply create the following batch file as P.BAT:andM;@ECHO OFF d: \Prism subdirectory name\PRISM %1andM;ECHOandM;The d:, of course, stands for the appropriate drive letter.andP;  Now store P.BATin a subdirectory that is listed in the DOS path and you'll be able to runPRISM from any directory or subdirectory of your hard disk simply byentering.andM;P [palette name]andM;and pressing Enter.andM;The reason this works is that DOS 3.x (and higher) stores the full pathnameof the current program in that program's environment and thereby allows aprogram to locate itself, no matter where it is.andP;  PRISM uses this informationto read and write its configuration file and palette files to the samesubdirectory in which the program itself is stored.andP;  PRISM doesn't care whichsubdirectory is currently active; it only reads and writes to its homesubdirectory.andM;Most of us are used to programs that look first in the current directory forfiles they need and accept a full pathname for a file.andP;  If you attempt toload a palette in the current directory, you'll either fail (if a palettewith that name doesn't exist in the PRISM directory) or load the file of thesame name from the PRISM directory.andP;  If you attempt to give PRISM a fullpath, it will truncate it to 12 characters and, of course, not find the file.andM;You may wish to create distinctly different color sets for the variousapplications that you use on your computer.andP;  The best way to do this is towrite individual batch files to load the PRISM palette and then theapplication.andP;  For example, to use PRISM with Quattro Pro, you might createthe following QP.BAT file:andM;CALL P QUATTRO.PAL C:\QPRO\Q %1 CALL P DOS.PALandM;This batch file will load the palette you have designed for use with QuattroPro, then load Quattro Pro with any spreadsheet filename you enter on thecommand line with QP.andP;  The program will run normally, but with a moreattractively colored display.andP;  And when you exit Quattro, QP.BAT willautomatically reload the palette you have designed for use with the DOScommand line.andM;One important caveat, however, is that PRISM cannot maintain its paletteduring mode changes.andP;  While most people are primarily familiar with DOS inits text mode of display, your computer actually has more than one mode fordisplaying images.andP;  Text mode is a display of 80 columns by 25 rows, anddisplays characters only.andP;  Depending on the video display board and themonitor, graphics mode can display anywhere from 200 to 1,268 lines of videoinformation.andP;  In graphics mode, the DOS screen generates images (diagrams,icons, and images) a point at a time and uses a different method of assigningcolors.andP;  When in text mode, DOS generates its screens a character at a timeand uses the CGA standard for assigning colors.andP;  Whenever you change from onedisplay mode to another, DOS resets all video registers to their defaultcondition and any changes you have made in the VGA attribute registers willbe lost.andP;  To return to text mode from graphics mode, enter MODE C080 and thenenter the PRISM command to reload the palette you wish to restore.andM;PRISM is UltraVision-compatible.andP;  UltraVision is an EGA/VGA enhancementutility that lets you reset the number of rows and columns visible in yourtext mode display, change the display font, and sharpen the display buputting more lines of video information on the screen.andP;  Also, UltraVisionlets you reset your 16 DOS attributes to any color you choose, selected fromthe EGA palette of 64 shades.andP;  PRISM supersedes this latter function.andM;To make use of UltraVision's other functions, however, simply load thatprogram first, before loading your desired PRISM palette.andP;  PRISM will thenuse the EGA registers that UltraVision has selected as pointers to the VGAregisters.andP;  If you run UltraVision after you have used PRISM to load apalette, you will lose your PRISM palette.andP;  UltraVision will reset theEGA/VGA registers.andM;PRISM will not run under Windows or DESQview.andP;  These multitaskingenvironments attempt to maintain graphics and color integrity across multiplewindows.andP;  As a result, they will definitely conflict with PRISM, which is atext mode only utility.andP;  Within that restriction, however, PRISM opens up theVGA color spectrum you've paid for but rarely seen.andM;SATURATION AND INTENSITYandM;It's often not enough simply to adjust the primary color components of anattribute; sometimes you need to brighten or darken the color.andP;  A color thathas been brightened becomes a pastel shade; a color that has been darkened isa muted shade.andM;To brighten a color, then, you use the Saturation control.andP;  When Saturationis at its maximum, that attribute can hold no more color.andP;  In effect, it hasno white component added to it.andP;  As saturation is reduced, more and morecolor is subtracted and the visual effect is as if more and more white hasbeen added to the color mix.andM;To darken a color, you use PRISM's Intensity control.andP;
