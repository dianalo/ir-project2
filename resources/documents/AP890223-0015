Such bans were called ``invidious discrimination'' by theassociation's president, Peter G. Keane.   According to Thursday editions of the San Francisco Banner DailyJournal, the association's directors unanimously urged that thecurrent state civil code mandating marriages between ``a man and awoman'' be changed to read ``marriage is a personal relation arisingout of a civil contract between two people.''   Such a change would give partners of both homosexuals andheterosexuals many of the same rights now enjoyed as part of legalmarriage.   Keane said banning same-sex marriages was a ``clear denial ofequal protection under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution bysingling out an identifiable class of people.''   He added that a new definition of marriage is needed to correct``invidious discrimination against non-heterosexuals who choose tohave a relationship that has the same quality and definition that ahusband and wife have.''   Members of the board said the same-sex marriage law couldeliminate the need for so-called domestic partners legislation.   Harry Britt, an openly gay member of the city council, hasproposed the legislation to make medical and other benefitsavailable to live-in companions.</TEXT></DOC>
