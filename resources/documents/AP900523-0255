Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. is seeking $700 million from twoFinland-based companies that owned Wartsila Marine Industries Inc.,which filed for bankrupcty last November before completing athree-ship contract for Carnival.   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Miami, claimsMiami-based Carnival suffered $400 million in additionalconstruction costs and lost passenger bookings. The suit also seeks$300 million in punitive damages from Oy Wartsila Ab and Valmet OyAb.   In 1987, Carnival signed a $600 million contract with Wartsilafor three 2,600-passenger ships. But the bankruptcy halted all workat the Helsinki yard, which was taken over by several shipowners,the Union Bank of Finland and the Finnish government.   The new yard, renamed Masa-Yards, completed work on the Fantasy,which began service March 2. The Ecstasy is under construction atMasa-Yards and scheduled for delivery in April 1991.   Carnival, which has an 11 percent stake in Masa, is looking atseveral European shipyards for the Sensation, the third vessel fromthe Wartsila contract, said company spokesman Tim Gallagher.   The suit alleges the two companies misrepresented the financialcondition of the Wartsila yard in order to get the Carnivalcontract. Among the allegations is that Warstila principalstransferred overvalued assets and hid losses from some shipbuildingcontracts.   Carnival attorney Lewis Clayton said Wednesday he did not knowwhether the defendants had hired attorneys in the United States.Officials at the two companies could not immediately be reached inFinland for comment.   Carnival recently signed a $700 million contract withFincantierri Shipyards of Trieste, Italy, for three vessels for itsHolland America Line subsidiary.   Carnival, which presently operates 15 ships worldwide, blamedship-refurbishing projects for a 46 percent decline infirst-quarter profits this year.   Income for the quarter fell to $25.2 million, or 19 cents ashare, compared with $46.3 million, or 34 cents a share, for thesame period last year. During the period, two ships were tied upfor maintenance and improvements.   Revenues for the quarter ended Feb. 28 rose to $259.4 millionfrom $231.8 million, the company said.</TEXT></DOC>
