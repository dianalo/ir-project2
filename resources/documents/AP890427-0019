First item: Must the court, in resolving an abortion-regulationcontroversy from Missouri, plunge into its landmark 1973 decisionthat women have a constitutional right to end their pregnancies?   Although Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist may conduct aninitial vote Friday and begin the opinion-writing process, thecourt's final decision likely will not be announced until late Juneor early July.   Missouri officials and the Bush administration are urging thecourt to overturn or curtail the 16-year-old ruling in Roe vs.Wade. And while speculating about the Supreme Court's direction isalways tricky business, questions from the bench in Wednesday'sargument session indicated three key justices may be willing toundertake a broad review of abortion rights.   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M.Kennedy _ all appointees of former President Reagan _ pointedlyasked lawyers for both sides about the dimensions of abortionrights.   ``Do you say there is no fundamental right to decide whether tohave a child or not? A right to procreate?'' O'Connor asked theadministration's lawyer. ``Do you deny that the Constitutionprotects that right?''   Scalia asked the lawyer representing opponents of the Missourilaw, ``How can you derive (a fundamental right) without making adetermination as to whether the fetus is a human life or not?''   The justice added, ``It is very hard to say it just as a matterof basic principle that it must be a fundamental right unless youmake the determination that the organism that is destroyed is not ahuman life.''   Kennedy asked the administration's lawyer about a 1965 SupremeCourt decision striking down a state law that barred use ofcontraceptives _ the high court's first enunciation of theconstitutional ``privacy'' right which served as the basis for Roevs. Wade.   ``Does the (1965) case stand for the proposition that there is aright to determine whether to procreate?'' Kennedy asked.   Of the justices considered strong supporters of abortion rights_ Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and JohnPaul Stevens _ only Stevens participated fully in the session.Brennan asked one question; Blackmun and Marshall none.   Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. White, dissenters in andconsistent critics of Roe vs. Wade, each asked several questionsbut seemed intent on giving the three junior justices as much timeas they needed.   Their questions could have zeroed in on the particulars of theMissouri law's regulations. Many of them did not.   The court, however, still could resolve the Missouri casewithout reconsidering Roe vs. Wade.   Such a decision still would be read as a barometer of thecurrent justices' commitment to the 1973 ruling, but might notaffect many women outside Missouri. Higher stakes would be left fora future case.   But the possibility exists for a broader ruling, one thatincludes in its scope a nation in which 1.5 million legal abortionsare performed each year.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Richard Carelli has covered the Supreme Courtfor The Associated Press since 1976.</TEXT></DOC>
