Kevin Phillips, a widely read political critic, has chafedthat Americans, beset with their &quot;single ambition&quot; of doinganything that would make money, had forsaken their concernfor others in a pursuit of &quot;conspicuous opulence.&quot; Of course,Ronald Reagan was to blame, or so we were told.</LP><TEXT>   Yet such comments clash with the facts. Americans havealways given a modest fraction of their incomes to charitablecauses, and during the '80s they were unusually generous, nomatter how the record is measured. As the accompanying chartshows, total charitable giving (measured in 1990 dollars)continued to reach record highs throughout the 1980s.   Between 1955 and 1980, total charitable contributions --by living individuals, bequests, corporations and foundations-- more than doubled in 1990 dollars, increasing from $34.5billion to $77.5 billion, or at a compounded annual growthrate of 3.3%. Between 1980 and 1989, total giving in realdollars expanded 56% to $121 billion, or by a compound annualgrowth rate of 5.1%. The yearly rate of growth in totalgiving in the 1980s was nearly 55% higher than in theprevious 25 years.   Private charitable contributions by individuals grew at a68% faster pace in the 1980s (5.2% a year) than in the late1970s and earlier years (3.1% a year between 1955 and 1980).And it should be noted that in the 1980s individualsincreased their giving by substantially more than theyincreased their purchases on consumer goods in general and ona wide range of goods and services that might be consideredextravagances.   For example, the percentage increase in giving between1980 and 1989 was 46% greater than the percentage rise inpurchases of jewelry and watches, 58% greater than thepercentage rise in expenditures on beauty parlors and healthclubs, and 25% greater than the percentage rise inoutstanding consumer debt. Private giving also acceleratedduring the 1980s while tax payments, which are frequentlyintended to serve charitable objectives, continued upward inreal dollars and as a percentage of national income.   Charitable contributions by corporations also rosesubstantially faster in the 1980s (4.1% a year) than inearlier decades (2.7% a year between 1955 and 1980). Theupsurge in corporate giving occurred in the 1980s in spite ofthe fact that corporate before- and after-tax profits as apercent of national income continued along a downward trend.Indeed, corporate giving as a percentage of before-taxprofits spurted upward in the 1980s and remained above highsachieved in earlier decades. Bequests and gifts fromfoundations also reached record levels in the 1980s.   The same upward trend in charitable giving in the 1980s isvisible when the data are adjusted for population growth.Real per-capita giving by individuals rose from $182 a personin 1955 to $284 in 1980 and then, after the recession of1980-81 ended, spurted to $409 in 1989. The annual rate ofgrowth in the 1980s was more than twice the rate of earlierdecades.   Charitable giving as a percentage of national incomeunderwent a U-turn in the late 1970s and early 1980s,switching from a declining share of national income in the1970s to an increasing share in the 1980s. Private donationsrose from a historic low of 2.1% of national income in 1979to 2.7% in 1989.   Critics might complain that the growth in privategenerosity in the 1980s was a product of the growth in incomeor represented a continuation of the long-term upward trendin giving. Econometric analysis of the giving data refutesthis view, however.   Annual total giving in constant dollars was, on average,more than $14 billion, or 16%, higher during the 1980s thanwould have been predicted from the philanthropic pattern ofthe late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.   Clearly, there were instances of outlandish efforts bysome Americans to achieve &quot;conspicuous opulence&quot; with totaldisregard for the welfare of other people, and the media havecovered these instances with their usual vigilance. But greedhas been around for a very long time. Claims that the 1980swere a &quot;Decade of Greed&quot; are far too sweeping, bordering onthe reckless. Compared with earlier decades, the 1980s were adecade of renewed beneficence.   ---   Mr. McKenzie, author of the report &quot;Was the Decade of the1980s a `Decade of Greed'?&quot; (Center for the Study of AmericanBusiness at Washington University in St. Louis), is aprofessor in the Graduate School of Management at theUniversity of California, Irvine.</TEXT></DOC>
