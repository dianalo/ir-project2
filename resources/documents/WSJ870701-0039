He confirmed that Lockheed-Georgia is talking to Airbus, among other concerns. One Lockheed executive said early discussions have involved possible subassemblies for the Airbus A-330 and A-340 models, but he called any speculation that Lockheed might have a role in the final jetliner assembly process &quot;premature.&quot;    Lockheed-Georgia currently produces two military airlift transports, the C-5B Galaxy and the C-130 Hercules.    In Toulouse, France, an Airbus spokesman said the four-nation consortium hasn't decided whether to open new production in the U.S. or elsewhere. But with Airbus's 150-seat A-320 model selling well and with other projects coming up, Airbus is known to be considering the idea.    Airbus currently is dividing the work between its partners and subcontractors for its new A-330 and A-340 models, which will go into production in the early 1990s. About 20% of the work on the sister jetliners will be parceled out to others, the spokesman said, &quot;but any talks we've had with American companies has been for a small participation.&quot; He declined to identify those companies.    Lockheed, a Calabasas, Calif.-based aerospace and electronics concern, ended its longtime involvement with commercial aircraft at the end of 1981, when it announced plans to phase out its loss-ridden L-1011 TriStar jumbo jet program.    But while the big defense contractor has said since then that it is wary of getting burned on new jetliner programs, it has maintained at least a passing interest in commercial aircraft ventures. In 1982, for example, it flirted with a proposal from some airlines that Lockheed convert older Boeing Co. 727 trijets into twin-engine planes that would use less fuel.    Airbus is a grouping of Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain. </TEXT></DOC>
