A great deal of money is being lost.''   Brokers said the drop was triggered primarily by news that alabor-management group failed to secure financing for the proposed$6.75 billion takeover of United Airlines parent UAL Corp.   Acquisition of the company would have relied largely on the saleof high-risk ``junk bonds,'' commonly used to finance takeoversknown as leveraged buyouts.   ``The UAL announcement means the problems in the junk bondmarket are spreading,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president atFirst Albany Corp.   ``It means that it's going to be difficult _ even impossible _to finance acquisitions and leveraged buyouts,'' he said.``Leveraged buyouts have been the principal drive to stock pricesthis year ... and if that prop gets removed, stocks would have togo down.''   Brokers said computerized selling strategies that can dumpstocks on the market accelerated the plunge, the same scenario thatpreceded the 1987 crash.   At the closing bell, the widely watched Dow Jones average of 30industrial stocks had plunged by 190.58 points to 2,569.26, by farthe biggest drop since the 508-point crash on Oct. 19, 1987. Otherstock indices also fell sharply.   The figure represented a drop of 6.91 percent in the Dow, butstill was the 12th largest percentage decline on record. UntilFriday, the worst Dow drop this year occurred March 17, when theindex lost about 48 points.   The speed of the decline on Friday the 13th spooked traders whowere reminded of the epic stock panic nearly two years ago to theday. More than 250 million shares changed hands and nearly $200billion in stock values were wiped out.   ``Nobody believes in witchcraft, but we're seeing the same typeof phenomenon that propelled the market down two years ago,'' saidWashington economist Michael Evans.   Dazed financial workers poured out of their offices into thecanyons of Wall Street assessing the damage and making comparisonsto 1987.   The plunge triggered panicky trading in the currency markets andsent the dollar's value sharply lower.   Bond prices rose dramatically as investors sought a safe havenin the credit markets. Interest rates, which drop when bond pricesrise, dropped to their lowest levels since April 1987.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said in a statement thatthe decline ``should be viewed in the context of a 591-point risesince Jan. 1, 1989.'' He said the drop ``doesn't signal anyfundamental change in the condition of the economy. The economyremains well balanced and the outlook is for continued moderategrowth.''   U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C.Breeden, who took office earlier this week, had no comment. TheFederal Reserve also had no comment.   President Bush, leaving the White House for the weekend at CampDavid, ignored shouted questions from reporters about the plunge.   New York Stock Exchange President Richard A. Grasso saidsafeguards put in place after the 1987 debacle helped soften theblow from Friday's drop.   ``All of the safeguards and the coordination procedures that wedeveloped in the last two years were utilized today and workedexceptionally well,'' Grasso said.   Problems in the risky junk-bond market were exacerbated lastmonth when Canadian retailing giant Campeau Corp. announced it wasunable to make payments on some of the bonds it issued in itsbuyouts of Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc.   Skittishness has sharply curbed investors' appetite for junkbonds, so named because of their low credit ratings, just as alarge number were to be sold by the end of the year. Prices of junkbonds dropped for the 17th straight day Friday.   The UAL news ``seemed to trigger a selling panic,'' said analystHildegarde Zagorski of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. UAL, thesecond-biggest airline in the country, is part of the DowTransportation index.   The casualties included companies currently involved in takeoverfights and firms that have already won their battles. Among thehardest hit was Time Warner Inc., which is in the process ofcompleting its $14 billion acquisition of Warner CommunicationsInc. Time Warner skidded $11.25 a share to $131.75, AmericanAirlines parent AMR Corp., which faces a $7 billion takeover bidfrom developer Donald Trump. AMR slipped 12{ cents from Thursday'sclose to finish at $98.62{ a share.   Other observers said news from the Labor Department thatwholesale prices rose sharply in September suggested inflation washeating up again, reducing the likelihood the Federal Reserve wouldact to ease interest rates.   The Dow's decline reverberated in Canada, where stock pricessuffered their worst decline in two years. The key 300-sharecomposite index at the Toronto Stock Exchange, the only foreignmarket open during Wall Street's plunge, lost 141.69 points toclose at 3,870.74 to conclude what had been a quiet session.   The fallout is expected to continue, beginning late Sunday U.S.time, when foreign markets reopen, beginning with New Zealand andAustralia and followed by Japan, Hong Kong and European markets.   In New York, the market had been gradually retreating throughoutFriday's session, with the Dow off about 23 points at 2 p.m. EDT.But a tailspin pushed the key index down an additional 100 pointsin little more than an hour amid news the UAL deal had run aground.   The drop was eerily reminiscent of a 108-point Dow drop on aFriday exactly two years ago, which proved to be a harbinger of thecentury's second stock market disaster on the following Monday _Oct. 19.   Zagorski said she did not expect the events of 1987 to berepeated. ``It's not going to go down too much further from theselevels,'' she said shortly before the market closed.   Peroni, however, said such a severe drop on a Friday is causefor particular concern. ``It's bad because it means that there'sgoing to be two days for fear to fester'' before investors have achance to trade again Monday.   Following the 1987 crash, regulators imposed what they called``circuit breakers'' on the Dow that would automatically limittrading if the index rose or fell 50 points. The restriction waslater expanded to 250 points as part of a coordinated program withother stock and futures markets.   But confusion over the rule was rampant Friday. ``Nobody seemsto be clear on where the circuit breaker is,'' Peroni said. ``Ifthere is one, it certainly is failing.''   In Chicago, similar circuit breakers went into effect for thefirst time Friday when trading in Standard andamp; Poor's 500 futures onthe Mercantile Exchange was halted after the December contract fellthe limit of 12 points.   Trading resumed after the required 30-minute halt, but thecontract fell the limit again and trading ceased once more beforethe market was to close.</TEXT></DOC>
