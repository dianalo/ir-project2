All other floatingproduction systems in operation today are designed for site-specificconditions and would require significant modification for other applications.In its present configuration this turret-moored process plant/storagetanker receives production from a single subsea well via either rigidor flexible risers. Stabilized crude is exported by an off-loading systemto a shuttle tanker. This paper reviews the manufacture, testing, installationand early operating experience for the subsea production equipment associatedwith the Petrojarl I Production/Test Ship (PTS). It provides an overviewof the system together with some of the more important design parameters.It also recounts the actual manufacturing, testing, installation andearly operating experience for the subsea and other critical systems.This new type of production system is seen to be technically feasibleand is also proving to be an economic success even in current depressedmarket conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
