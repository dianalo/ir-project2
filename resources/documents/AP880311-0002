The March report of the U.S. Helsinki Watch Committee and theAsia Watch Committee is based on a September-October fact-findingmission to Pakistan, Afghanistan's neighbor to the south and a basefor opposition forces fighting the Soviet-backed government.   The report's authors said all requests to visit Kabul or othercities under the government's control went unanswered.   ``Afghanistan has been the scene of some of the most serioushuman rights violations on record,'' the report said. ``Aboutone-half of the country's prewar population ... is either inemigration, or internally displaced, or dead.''   The report, the committees' fourth on human rights violations inAfghanistan since 1984, noted that most abuses reported previouslyhad continued. The government is guilty of most of the abuses, itsaid.   ``Indiscriminate warfare in the countryside combined withtotalitarian controls in the cities have brought incalculablesuffering to the Afghan people,'' it said.   Resistance groups also were accused of violations, as inprevious reports.   ``We continue to deplore the execution of prisoners of war bythe resistance, often after a trial that is lacking in most aspectsof what we consider due process,'' the report said.   It specifically mentioned abuses by the Hezb-I-Islami resistancegroup, led by Gulbaddin Hekmatyar.   ``Abuses by this group seem to have become even more extreme inthe past year and reportedly include politically motivatedassassinations, the taking of hostages,'' the committees said.   If a settlement is reached in Afghanistan's civil war, thecommittees said, the Hezb-I-Islami and other groups ``guilty ofgross human rights violations'' should not be given much influencein a new government.   The report noted ``seemingly positive developments'' in 1987,including the government's call for refugees to return toAfghanistan and amnesty declarations for thousands of prisoners.   The New York-based U.S. Helsinki Watch Committee was founded in1979 to promote domestic and international compliance with humanrights provisions of the 1975 Helsinki accords.   The Washington-based Asia Watch Committee was founded in 1985 topromote internationally recognized human rights in Asia. Both areprivate, non-profit groups.</TEXT></DOC>
