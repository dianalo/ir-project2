It has been determined that the provisionsof this rule will not result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of$100 million or more; (2) major increases in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State or local government agencies, orgeographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation or on the ability of UnitedStates-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.CCC previously published final rule on March 1, 1988 (53 FR 6131) and November25, 1988 (53 FR 47658) with respect to CCC price support programs for feedgrains, peanuts, rice, soybeans and wheat which are set forth at 7 CFRPart 1421. Those amendments were made to delete obsolete provisions andto provide greater uniformity between the programs. The changes made bythis interim rule will, to the maximum extent practicable, provide thatthe upland and extra long staple cotton and honey programs are administeredin the same manner as the aforementioned programs.The interim rule also deletes in 7 CFR Parts 1421 and 1427 references tospecific amounts which are charged by CCC for loan-making and related services.Most of the current fees have been in effect since the 1974 crop year.Fees for sugar processor loans were implemented for the 1982 crop. Sincethe current fees charged do not recover the cost of either the total loanadministration function or the loan-making activity alone, 7 CFR Parts1421 and 1427 are amended to allow for increases in fees so that CCC mayrecover a greater portion of the current costs incurred. The interim ruleprovides that such rates will be as determined by CCC in order that CCCmay more accurately determine such rates on a State by State basis by takinginto account differences in State laws that affect loan-making activitiesand actual costs incurred by CCC when providing price support to producers.This rule also amends the cotton and honey price support loan provisionswith respect to lien subordination agreements. Since CCC price supportloans are nonrecourse loans, producers may forfeit the loan collateralin total satisfaction of the loan. Therefore, CCC has required all partieswhich have a lien on the commodity which has been pledged as collateralfor such a loan to execute either a lien waiver or lien subordination agreementwith respect to such commodity before a CCC price support loan is madeto the producer. In order to protect fully CCC's interest in the commoditywhich may be forfeited upon the maturity of the loan, CCC no longer utilizeslien subordination agreements. Accordingly, 7 CFR Parts 1427 and 1434 arerevised by deleting references to such agreements.Since producers are currently making decisions regarding commodities whichmay be pledged as collateral for CCC price support loans, the provisionsof this interim rule are effective upon publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Comments are requested, however, and will betaken into consideration when developing the final rule.It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicableto the interim rule since neither the Agricultural Stabilization and ConservationService (ASCS) nor the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is required by5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposedrulemaking with respect to the subject matter of this rule.It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this actionwill have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment.Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental ImpactStatement is needed.This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and localofficials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, publishedat 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>7 CFR Part 1421Grains, Loan programs_agriculture, Price support programs.7 CFR Part 1427Cotton, Loan programs_agriculture, Price support programs.7 CFR Part 1434Honey, Loan programs_agriculture, Price support programs.Accordingly, Chapter XIV of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulationsis revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1427_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
