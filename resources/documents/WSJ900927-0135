The brothers (Joel directing,Ethan producing) were like a modern-day vaudeville act. Youcould almost hear the barker: &quot;And now presenting . . . thedynamic duo, up from Minneapolis and into Manhattan . . . theCoen Brothers]&quot;   Though much praised by many critics and appreciated byaudiences as well, the Coens were criticized in some quartersfor making pictures that were too cartoonish, maybe forhaving too much fun. So now they've decided to show that theyare serious fellows, that they are capable of making Art.</LP><TEXT>   And their new movie, &quot;Miller's Crossing,&quot; is artfulindeed. This elegiac gangster movie has some strong writing,a somber beauty and very good performances all around. Butthe Coens seem to have been intent on showing how restrainedthey could be, and how deep. They've constructed theirgangsters the way a European who loves American movies (butwho in some fundamental way doesn't really understand them)might: as brooding creatures with impenetrable psyches whoseevery move contains some higher symbolism. In other words,&quot;Miller's Crossing&quot; is a little pretentious.   The story revolves around Tommy (Gabriel Byrne), theenigmatic lieutenant of Leo, the powerful Irish boss in someunnamed American city, in 1929. The fact that the city isunnamed may be part of the film's problem. There is a lack ofspecificity of detail that makes the picture too much of amood piece. There are too many reprises of the image ofTommy's hat flying through the air, and too littleinformation about what's happening to whom, when.   Tommy is a problematic main character because he operatesby keeping everything in. Mr. Byrne has a brooding intensitybut watching him watch everyone, and calculate what to donext, becomes a little tedious (it doesn't help that Mr.Byrne's strong Irish accent is somewhat difficult to followwhen he does speak).   He and Leo have a falling out when Tommy tells Leo they'reinvolved with the same woman, only Tommy's sleeping with herand Leo isn't. Tommy takes up with a rival gang, and ends upsetting off a major gang war. The story operates obliquely,as a series of darkly poetic images that seem to hold a greatdeal of significance though it isn't always easy to decipherwhat the significance is.   The woman, Verna, manages to be enigmatic and specific atthe same time. Played by the stage actress Marcia Gay Harden,who shows enormous promise here in her first film role,Verna's been hardboiled just the right number of minutes.   It's Verna's brother Bernie, however, who's the realcatalyst of the action. He's called &quot;shmatta,&quot; Yiddish forrag, and he's the inconsequential little man who can detonatea war. John Turturro, perpetrator of the amusing caricatureof a Jewish nightclub owner in Spike Lee's &quot;Mo' BetterBlues,&quot; runs Bernie through the gamut -- from sniveler toarrogant conniver, all to great effect.   Albert Finney's Leo is a compelling figure; a quiet,courtly man capable of great brutality. But Leo doesn't seemto get a kick out of it. When he feels he has to inflict painit seems to pain him. It's an unpleasant but necessary partof his job as the main man. Mr. Finney is masterful, asalways, and makes one wish there were more Leo and fewerhats.   ---   The gossip columns reported the other day that KatharineHepburn didn't care for Clint Eastwood's new film, &quot;WhiteHunter, Black Heart.&quot; The picture is based on the 1953 PeterViertel novel that seemed very much to be the story of JohnHuston and the making of &quot;The African Queen,&quot; even though Mr.Viertel said it wasn't.   It's easy to see why Ms. Hepburn wouldn't like the movie,since the representation by Marisa Berenson of an actresscalled Kay Gibson who appeared to be modeled on Ms. Hepburnis the weakest of imitations. In fact, we get the impressionthat the camera rolled too early and didn't really film theactors but instead shot the stand-ins used to set the lightsbefore the actual performers are brought on the set.   The miscasting started at the top, with Mr. Eastwoodputting himself in the role of Pete Wilson, the compulsive,arrogant John Huston-like director. Mr. Eastwood gets acrossthe director's bullheadedness but none of his legendarycharm. His Wilson's a stiff.   Still, the film is an undeniably compelling portrait ofobsession. Mr. Eastwood's direction, thoughcharacteristically dark, lays the story out with clarity andintelligence. But the real power lies in the script, whichMr. Viertel adapted from his book 30 years ago, and whichalso was worked on by James Bridges and Burt Kennedy. Thelanguage is tough, smart, sly and cruel. It would have beengreat to see John Huston speaking it.   ---   VIDEO TIP: Peter Viertel accompanied John Huston to Africato work with him on the script of &quot;The African Queen&quot; abouttwo years before &quot;White Hunter, Black Heart&quot; was published.That book, together with Ms. Hepburn's recent account of themaking of that film, are good preparation for the Hustonmovie, which gets better and better with each viewing.</TEXT></DOC>
