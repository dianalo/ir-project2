Industry sources had earlier forecast an 8.9% drop.    A series of temporary plant closings to adjust inventories and the continuation of a number of prolonged shutdowns for model changeovers accounted for the lower April production.    In the month, the eight domestic auto makers built a combined total of 673,300 cars, compared with 798,214 cars built in the like period last year.    Volkswagen of America last week reported it would close its Westmoreland, Pa., car assembly plant for the first time in more than two years because its Golf, Jetta and GTI models were selling slowly. Its production dropped 27.9%.    General Motors Corp. posted a 23.3% drop in car production, to about 362,526 cars from 472,956 in the year-earlier period.    Chrysler Corp.'s April output fell 24.2%, to 88,632 cars from 116,942 cars last April. Ford Motor Co., however, reported production in the month decreased by only 5.7%, to 168,456 cars from 178,732 last year.    Production of domestically built trucks and buses by auto makers in April totaled 334,156, about flat with the 336,885 built a year ago.    Year-to-date, car production fell 7%, or about 216,000 cars, while truck producton increased 5%.    ---                       April     April    4-months  4-months U.S. Output            1987      1986      1987      1986    GENERAL MOTORS    Cars-b .......... 362,526   472,956  1,513,811 1,810,229    Trucks-buses .... 160,602   168,496    604,394   655,152    Total ........... 523,128   641,452  2,118,205 2,465,381    FORD    Cars ........... e168,456   178,732   e702,665   625,237    Trucks ......... e127,619   136,319   e531,455   499,305    Total .......... e296,075   315,051 e1,234,120 1,124,542    CHRYSLER    Cars ............. 88,632   116,942    404,267   490,423    Trucks ........... 19,285     6,141     83,080     6,275    Total ........... 107,917   123,083    487,347   496,698    AMERICAN MOTORS    Cars .............. 3,052     3,990     11,699    16,543    Trucks ........... 19,134    12,621     77,731    69,422    Total ............ 22,186    16,611     89,430    85,965    VOLKSWAGEN    Total ............. 6,354     8,822     29,157    30,842    HONDA    Total ............ 28,676    16,772    116,074    62,186    NISSAN    Cars ............. 12,426         0     48,750    21,517    Trucks ............ 7,516    13,308     29,085    31,771    Total ............ 19,942    13,308     77,835    53,288    TOYOTA    Total-a ........... 3,178         0     13,570         0    INDUSTRY    Cars ........... e673,300   798,214 e2,839,993 3,056,977    Trucks-buses-x . e334,156   336,885 e1,325,745 1,261,925    Total ......... 1,007,456 1,135,099 e4,165,738 4,318,902   a-Includes Toyota FX and FX-16 cars only. b-GM car figuresinclude the Chevrolet Nova built at Nummi. x-Includes onlybuses and trucks built by auto makers.   e-Estimated.</TEXT></DOC>
