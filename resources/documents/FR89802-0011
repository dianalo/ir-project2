The new forms allow use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR)for direct recording of export license information into the Commerce Departmentcomputer data base, thus eliminating the need for manual entry. In addition,the rule provided the revision of these forms to carry the ``BXA'' designation(e.g., BXA-622P) in order to reflect the Bureau of Export Administrationas a separate entity from the International Trade Administration withinthe U.S. Department of Commerce. This rule amends Supplement No. 5 to Part 773, establishing new instructionsfor Distribution License applicants when completing the new Form BXA-622P.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>effective date: </T2>This rule is effective August 2, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact:</T2>Patricia Muldonian, RegulationsBranch, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration,Telephone: (202) 377-2440. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information:</T2> <ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements </ITAG>1. This rule is consistent with Executive Orders 12291 and 12661. 2. This rule contains collections of information subject to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under control number 0694-0015. Public reporting for this collectionof information is estimated to average 45 minutes per response, includingthe time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any otheraspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducingthis burden, to the Office of Security and Management Support, Bureau ofExport Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230;and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project(0694-0015), Washington, DC 20503. 3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603 <T3>et seq.</T3>) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis hasto be or will be prepared. 4. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. 5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA)(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruledoes not impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking andan opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. Therefore, thisregulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal commentperiod, public comments on this regulation are always welcome on a continuingbasis. Comments should be submitted to Patricia Muldonian, Office of Technologyand Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce,P.O.
