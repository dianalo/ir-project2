School,Artisoft vice president.andM;One of the uses of the networked PCs, Konkal said, will be to eliminate astep in keeping track of expenses on large government contracts.andP;  &quot;ContractorA needs to give government accounting its daily expenditures.andP;  Contractor Bneeds to feed into it.andP;  The accounting department gets all these diskettes atthe end of a day, and it has to merge that information into its accountingdatabase.andP;  You can see where a network would increase productivity byallowing a contractor to put his information directly into the database.&quot;andM;Konkal worries, however, that if he provides a network that has a tendency todevelop bottlenecks, the contractors may avoid using it.andM;Konkal must decide between cost and network speed when he makes the nextdecision: whether to rewire and go to 10-megabit/sec coaxial cable runningEthernet protocols and the LANtastic operating system, or to stick with theexisting but slower 4-megabit/sec PC Office interface card and twisted-pairwiring.andM;About the operating system there is no question.andP;  &quot;We have settled onLANtastic as our operating system of choice,&quot; he said.andM;LANtastic's operating system features include file- and record-locking,printer sharing and electronic mail.andP;  &quot;The file security they built into theoperating system and the audit trail is, in my opinion, comparable to whatNovell just released,&quot; he said.andM;LANtastic runs on IBM PC, XT, AT and 80386-based IBM and -compatiblecomputers.andP;  A network can connect up to 32 workstations without repeaters, upto a distance of 1,500 feet.andM;Upgrades to be released sometime this year will allow for bridging betweendiverse network interface cards and network topologies, company officialshave said.andM;The software costs $295 per network when LANtastic 2-megabit interface cardsare used.andP;  Adapter-independent LANtastic software costs $495 per network.andO;The price of Artisoft's adapter-independent NetBIOS for other vendors' LANinterface cards is $295 per network.andP;  Lantastic 2-megabit interface cardscost $199 per card.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
