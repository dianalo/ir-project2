Critics of the program in Texas -- which accounts for morethan 1,000 of the 10,000 schools that carry the programnationwide -- contend that it should be dropped because thedaily 12-minute program includes two minutes of advertisingdirected at students.</LP><TEXT>   Although the state's Board of Education hasn't yet takenany action, it has asked for a legal opinion on whether itcan regulate commercial access to students on a statewidebasis. Individual school districts in the state currently canchoose whether to carry the daily news program; in return forcarrying the program, districts receive video and relatedequipment free from Whittle as long as they carry theprogram.   Texas school board officials note that over a year's time,the daily two minutes of commercials add up to a singleschool day; the 12 minutes spent viewing the entire programtotal six school days.   Channel One has been controversial since its inceptionlast year. It already is banned in New York and virtuallybanned in California through financial penalties imposed bythe state on schools that carry the program.   &quot;I think most school issues should be local, and moststates seem to agree with that,&quot; said Thomas Ingram, aWhittle spokesman. He noted that other states, includingNorth Carolina, have considered restrictions but decided tolet local districts choose whether they want to carry ChannelOne.   As in other states, Texas critics contend that advertisingin the classroom is inappropriate because advertisers have acaptive audience. Moreover, the contents of some newsbroadcasts, such as a clip from an R-rated movie, haveoffended some parents. &quot;We're selling our kids' souls,&quot;complains Sandra Kibby, a spokeswoman for the Texas Congressof Parents and Teachers. &quot;We've allowed Kellogg's and Levi'sto come into the schools.&quot;   Adds Karen Miller, a parent whose children attend schoolin a district that carries Channel One: &quot;Watching commercialscan't be considered an educational activity. We're cedingcontrol of the curriculum to an outside organization.&quot;   Whittle has broadcast in Texas schools for about one year.The show features topics like the Supreme Court nominationand the Persian Gulf War -- as well as commercials fromadvertisers like candy makers and athletic shoe makers.   Currently, about 865,000 Texas junior high and high schoolstudents view the program daily. Whittle has convinced manydistricts that the program is worthwhile, and stressed theadvantages of the equipment, which can be used bycash-strapped schools for other video programming.   &quot;It's an interesting and effective tool to reinforce whatwe want our kids to learn,&quot; contends John Miller, principalat Kingwood Middle School, in Kingwood, Texas. &quot;The contextin the Whittle program offers a lot of opportunity for kidsto challenge, think, discuss and look at both sides of anissue.&quot;   But some Texas officials are concerned that Whittle hasoversold its contributions. So far, Whittle claims it hasinstalled as much as $50 million of equipment in Texasschools. But at a state Board of Education committee hearingthis month, board member Robert Aikin challenged thecompany's figures, estimating the cost of the equipment to becloser to $5 million. The board has asked the Knoxville,Tenn., communications concern to verify its claim at the nextcommittee meeting in January.</TEXT></DOC>
