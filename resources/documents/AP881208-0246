(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The federal grand jury that chargeddefrocked PTL founder Jim Bakker with bilking millions of dollarsfrom his followers has not completed its investigation, a sourcefamiliar with the probe said Wednesday.   ``All I can say is they haven't finished their business,'' said afederal law enforcement officer who requested anonymity.   The 23-member grand jury's term does not end until next month,and the second-floor room in the federal courthouse in downtownCharlotte is still reserved for the grand jury next week, accordingto the U.S. District Court's office.   A newspaper reported Wednesday that prosecutors and high-levelU.S. Department of Justice officials were debating whether to seekindictments accusing Bakker and some of his former associates withtax violations.   The Charlotte Observer quoted a source close to the investigationas saying: ``There's no indictment here concerning taxes. Seems tome that would be the big one.''   Bakker and Richard Dortch, a former senior executive vicepresident at PTL, are accused of diverting more than $4 million ofPTL money to their own benefit and of conspiring to defraud thepublic in raising millions of dollars to suport ``lavish andextravagant'' lifestyles.   The 24-count indictment issued Monday charges them with mailfraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. If convicted of all the charges,Bakker, 48, and Dortch, 57, each could be sentenced to 120 years inprison and fined $6 million.   Federal prosecutors have refused comment on the investigationsince it began 17 months ago.   U.S. Attorney Tom Ashcraft's office in Charlotte was referringall phone calls to the U.S. Department of Justice's public affairsoffice in Washington D.C.   Justice Department spokesman John Russell said he could notcomment on the investigation.   Bakker's attorney, Jim Toms, did not return phone calls to hisoffice Wednesday. Earlier, he said he didn't anticipate any morecharges against his client and said Bakker would plead innocent.   ``I think at this point, they've produced what they intend toproduce,'' Toms said Tuesday.   But Dortch's attorney, Bill Diehl, said he was surprised hisclient was not indicted on tax charges.   ``We expected tax indictments along with what we got indictedfor,'' he said Tuesday.   Bakker has declined to give interviews since his indictment.   His wife, Tammy Faye, who was not indicted, refused to talk withreporters when she drove off the grounds of the ministry's officesin this town just south of Charlotte Wednesday morning.   Also Wednesday, the newest member of Bakker's defense team,criminal law specialist Bob Davis, had his client's first courtappearance moved back to Jan. 9 from Dec. 15.   Dortch is still scheduled to appear in court next week, alongwith David Taggart, Baker's former personal aide at PTL, and hisbrother, James Taggart, PTL's former interior decorator. TheTaggarts were charged in the indictment with tax evasion andimpeding the IRS in collecting taxes for allegedly diverting about$1.1 million in PTL money to pay personal expenses.</TEXT></DOC>
