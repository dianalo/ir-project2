AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A military leader charged with drugsmuggling with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega pledged loyalty to thenew government and said he will submit to U.S. military authority,officials said Sunday.   Col. Luis del Cid, commander of the 5th Military Zone, held anews conference Saturday in the western city of David to make hisannouncement. Details of the development did not reach the capitaluntil Sunday.   U.S. airplanes and helicopters flew observation patrols over thecapital Sunday. No airborne fire or bombing was heard, but gunfire,heavy at times, crackled in some streets in the working-classneighborhood of San Miguelitos.   The U.S.-installed civilian government of President GuillermoEndara began forming a security force to quell looting andlawlessness in the streets.   About 2,000 U.S. troop reinforcements, including a helicoptercompany, were sent Saturday, the fourth day of the largest U.S.combat operation since the Vietnam War, boosting the U.S. troopstrength in the country to 26,000.   Noriega, the object of a massive U.S. search, remained at large.   The number of U.S. servicemen killed in the five days offighting rose to 25. Two American dependents also have been killed,241 troops wounded and one was missing. The U.S. military said 139Panamanian soldiers have died and 95 have been wounded. At least260 Panamanian civilians have been killed, according to Dr. ElmerMiranda, director of Santo Tomas Hospital.   The U.S. Southern Command said 2,250 people have been detained.   Del Cid, long one of Noriega's principal associates, saidconcern for the security of his 10 children weighed heavily in hisdecision not to resist the U.S. invasion and occupation force.   U.S. troops had not reached David, 210 miles west of PanamaCity, by early Sunday. The commander ordered David's airfield blownup Wednesday to prevent the landing of American aircraft.   Noriega, Del Cid and 14 others were indicted on drug charges inU.S. federal court in Miami in February 1988.   Del Cid told reporters his officers should be considered duringformation of a Panamanian military force to replace the routedDefense Forces of Noriega.   He also presided over the public surrender of arms by more than100 members of local ``Dignity Battalions,'' paramilitary unitsloyal to Noriega.   U.S. military authorities were unavailable for comment earlySunday as to whether Del Cid would be arrested and flown to Floridafor trial.   Noriega's Dignity Battalions have surprised the U.S. militarywith their strength and endurance. Joined by an unknown number ofsoldiers and officers from the 15,000-member Defense Forces, theyturned to guerrilla warfare.   The battalions are ``increasing their activities of harassingattacks with small arms and mortar fire, threatening the civilianpopulation and hostage-taking,'' Lt. Col. Jerry Marguila, spokesmanfor the U.S. Southern Command, said.   Earlier, Gen. Maxwell Thurman, the Southern Command chief, saidthe battalions are believed to have about 1,800 members and to beoperating in groups of about a dozen.   An Air Force plane repeatedly bombed a hilltop position ofloyalists Saturday in San Miguelito, and dozens of troops thendescended on the district. Residents said eight houses weredestroyed in the bombing, aimed at a house that reportedly stockedweapons for Noriega supporters.   Endara, sworn in as president Wednesday at the start of theinvasion, said he did not agree with the intervention but couldwork with the Americans.   The invasion was ``like a kick in the head,'' he said in aninterview. ``It was not the best thing I would have thought.''   ``We were not really consulted,'' said Endara. He said he wastold of the plans two or three hours before the first attacks werelaunched.   ``I would have been happier without an intervention,'' he said.Plans for maintaining public order should have been laid inadvance, he said.   Panama City is a busy duty-free commercial center jammed withstores that before the political crisis did a booming business inimported electronic equipment, cameras, watches, clothes, cloth andother merchandise.   Looters began ransacking its well-stocked supermarkts and otherstores hours after the invasion began and by Saturday hadn'tstopped.   Citizens took the law into their own hands, forming patrols andbuilding barricades to protect their homes.   Twenty members of the new public safety force were sworn inFriday, and more were to be sworn in over the weekend, Endara said.All the members, including the force commander, Col. RobertoArmijo, had been members of the Noriega-run police force, which waspart of the Defense Forces.   ``They swore allegiance to a new president, a new constitutionand democracy,'' Endara said.   Parts of the city of 1 million were in ruins from the U.S.bombing and debris from the looting littered the streets.   Supplies of food and medicine were dwindling.   ``We are trying to open the airport and trying to open theBridge of the Americas so we can bring in medicine and food,''Endara said. The bridge is the main crossing over the Panama Canal,which divides the country in two.   On Saturday, Noriega supporters released Jon Meyersohn, a CBSNews producer seized Wednesday at the Marriott Hotel, and DougMullen, an executive with GTE who was taken along with Meyersohn.</TEXT></DOC>
