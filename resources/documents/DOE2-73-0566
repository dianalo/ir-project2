<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-73-0566 </DOCNO><TEXT>We report here experimental results concerning the one nucleon strippingreactions (/sup 12/C, /sup 11/C) and (/sup 12/C, /sup 11/B) on a /sup208/Pb target at E/sub 12C/ = 480 MeV. We present the energy spectraup to about 15 MeV excitation energy and the angular distributions ofthe first excited levels. The comparison with similar reactions inducedby /sup 16/0 on /sup 208/Pb at E/sub 160/ = 793 MeV gives experimentalevidence of the population of the excited states in terms of two selectionrules. EFR-DWBA calculations reproduce fairly well the shape and theabsolute values of the differential cross-sections for the reactionsinduced by /sup 12/C, while they overestimate the experimental crosssections by a factor of ten in case of /sup 16/0. In both cases the extractedspectroscopic factors are in agreement with those found in the literature.</TEXT></DOC>
