Sterba</HL><DATE>02/28/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><LP>   We were leafing through the latest issue of the ParkingProfessional, admiring the editing and graphics of theplanet's only monthly magazine devoted to parking spaces,when we suddenly remembered the time Calvin Trillin, thewriter, came out of the closet about his murky affiliationwith the mysterious worlds of both editing and parking.   He didn't blurt it right out. Mr. Trillin isn't much of ablurter. He extruded it, roundaboutly, in the course of his90-minute, one-man off-Broadway show last fall entitled,&quot;Words, No Music.&quot; He started by noting that in terms ofprestige, news reporters rank at the bottom of thewordsmithing hierarchy. &quot;Unless,&quot; he blurted, &quot;you counteditors.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Trillin is no Adlai Stevenson, who used to say that aneditor is someone who sorts the wheat from the chaff -- andprints the chaff. (Mr. Stevenson appropriated that line froman upstate New York editor named Elbert Hubbard, who perishedaboard the torpedoed Lusitania in 1915.) Mr. Trillin was,nevertheless, cleverly affiliating himself with an ancientbut politically correct body of wisdom that more or lessholds editors to be loathsome, pea-brained nincompoops. (Thiswisdom isn't shared at the Journal, where we continue to beamazed daily by the prescience and insight of our belovededitors.)   Then Mr. Trillin coyly dropped his bombshell: He had, infact, actually been an editor once himself. To be precise,Mr. Trillin said he had been co-editor of Beautiful Spot: AMagazine of Parking. Because he has reportedly been known tojest, we decided to conduct an investigation into parkingpublications. There are three of them, if you include Mr.Trillin's BS, which is ideologically at odds with the othertwo in that it isn't fundamentally about revenue enhancement.(Americans pay upward of $8 billion annually to park theirnearly 200 million cars and trucks in the nation's more than100 million parking spaces.)   The aforementioned Parking Professional is five years old,publishes about 2,000 copies monthly, mainly formunicipalities, colleges, airports and hospitals. It looksvery professional. Lots of fresh angles, like the Novemberissue's article by New York parking authorities on how theycope with the city's 62,000 abused parking meters. It'sheadlined &quot;The S.P.I.R.I.T. {Special Parking IntegratedRevenue Impact Teams} of Parking,&quot; and says, in part:   &quot;Our meters have been lassoed, tied to truck bumpers andyanked from their moorings, hacked to pieces, surgicallydissected, systematically destroyed with battery acid andsubjected to every other abuse the creative mind can imagine.Soda tabs and other foreign objects have been jammed intocoin slots. In addition, over five tons of foreign coins andslugs accumulate each year, including cardboard slugs withobscene messages for the mayor.&quot; (Incidentally, the world'sfirst parking meter was installed on the southeast corner ofFirst Street and Robinson Avenue in Oklahoma City on July 16,1935.)   PP's editor, Marie E. Witmer, writes a cute DearAbby-style column called Dear DOTS (Director of TechnicalServices), to wit:   &quot;Dear DOTS: I keep hearing about the `SARA' laws. What arethey and how do they effect my parking operations? Puzzled inPennsylvania.&quot;   &quot;Dear Puzzled: The `Superfund Amendments andReauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA)' requires . . .&quot; You getthe drift.   The grandfather of parking publications is called Parking:The Magazine of the Parking Industry. It came out first in1952 as a biannual, became a quarterly and now comes out 10times a year. About 5,000 copies of each issue are sentmainly to commercial parking-lot and garage operators who aremembers of the National Parking Association (NPA), a tradeand lobbying group. Mr. Trillin disparagingly refers to theseguys as &quot;the Garage Interests.&quot;   But when we called up Parking's publisher, George V.Dragotta, the NPA's executive vice president, he reminded usjust what fine Americans operate garages and parking lots.Every day in this country they park and retrieve millions ofcars without anything untoward happening to them -- a recordof excellence the general public all too soon forgets becausethe media blow out of proportion the all-too-rare scratch ordent or parking-garage multiple homicide.   And again last Christmas, Mr. Dragotta told us, the NPAwas a national sponsor of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toysfor Tots Campaign, a positive fact that the major media choseto ignore (but Parking's editors put it on their Decembercover).   Inside Parking, we found plenty of articles on parking andthe wonderful story of how St. Mary's Church -- the oldestCatholic parish in Chicago, having served the Loopcontinuously since 1883 -- was saved by some of the finestbrains in Catholic parking. They built a 12-storychurch/parking garage combo that &quot;could succeed aestheticallyand economically&quot; (religous success was unmentioned).   Parking contains a curious column by a woman named LouCook called &quot;Between the Lines,&quot; which isn't about parking atall. Mr. Dragotta explained to us that the column is alwaysinteresting and its existence has absolutely nothing to dowith the fact that Ms. Cook is the wife of a former NPApresident. In the September issue, Ms. Cook wrote about howshe wants to be reincarnated as a French poodle. In November,she described her travails in New York's Lincoln Centerladies' rooms during intermissions.   Which brings us to Beautiful Spot: A Magazine of Parking.No one in the industry we talked to had heard of it. Then,one day during our investigation, our fax machine began tohum and out popped an entire issue of BS -- seven pagesuntouched by the modern graphics revolution but full ofprovincial highbrow humor and the kind of New Yorkintellectual angst that dogs the city's alternate-streetparkers, whom it says it is edited by and for. BS said it ispublished &quot;monthly or less.&quot; It promised such articles infuture issues as, &quot;The Algerian Problem (Parking inAlgiers),&quot; &quot;The Artic Tundra: Virgin Parkland&quot; and &quot;Parkingand the Jewish Question.&quot; Trouble was the issue we receivedread &quot;Volume One, March, 1962.&quot;   We immediately tracked down Mr. Trillin and asked him whatgave.   Production problems, he said. In fact, he added, BeautifulSpot's 29th anniversary celebration is being prepared -- acelebration &quot;dampened in only the smallest way by the factthat the second issue has yet to appear.&quot; The first issue,however, has plenty to ponder, including notice of asubsidiary Beautiful Spot Travel Agency, which organizestours to small Middle Western towns where big-city parkerscan park anywhere they want for free.   ---   The Parking Professional is published monthly by theInstitutional and Municipal Parking Congress, Box 7167,Fredericksburg, Va. 22401.
