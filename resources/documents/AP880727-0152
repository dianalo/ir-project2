North likely willbe dismissed if prosecutors cannot make arrangements for release ofkey secret documents in the Iran-Contra affair.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said at a hearing on a motionto postpone North's Sept. 20 trial that he can't make any decisionuntil ``we know what it is we're going to try.''   Gesell indicated, however, he would not agree to a suggestion byindependent counsel Lawrence Walsh that some of the 16 charges beset aside until the release of classified documents can be workedout and that the trial go ahead on the other charges.   ``It's now apparent that the government will not provide thedocuments I've ordered be disclosed to the defense,'' Gesell said.``Unless that isue can be reconciled by various stipulations oragreements ... it's clear to me ... that the conspiracy counts willhave to be dismissed.''   ``I've sent every signal I could that I have great doubts as towhether these counts can be tried,'' Gesell said.   The judge said he wanted documents that show what covertoperations were involved in the diversion of profits from the saleof arms to Iran, who in high places knew about them and how Northwas involved.   Walsh said that in the next two days he would go back togovernment intelligence officials and try to get documented answersto the questions Gesell posed.   The judge has already ordered that classified documents relatedto the case be made available to the defense, but intelligenceagencies have refused to turn over some key papers, citing nationalsecurity interests.   Walsh said he was ready to go ahead and try most of the countsagainst North and request that charges of conspiracy, theft ofgovernment property and wire raud be tried later.   That would leave charges against North involving obstruction ofjustice, personal enrichment and tax fraud.   Former national security adviser John Poindexter and armsdealers Richard Secord and Albert Hakim are due to have separatetrials on Iran-Contra charges. No dates have been set.   North's lawyers want his trial postponed until next March. Theysay Sept. 20 is too close to the presidential election and wouldnot allow them enough time to prepare a defense.   Barry Simon, lawyer for North, told Wednesday's hearing thetrial would be affected by the presidential campaign. He notedstatements by speakers at last week's Democratic Convention inAtlanta, including presidential candidate Michael Dukakis's pledgenot to issue pardons in the Iran-Contra affair if he is elected.   The judge noted that North had been giving speeches around thecountry and said, ``He certainly doesn't want to keep it out ofpolitics.'' </TEXT></DOC>
