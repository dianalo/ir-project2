PRECP-IV was based at Raleigh-DurhamNorth Carolina, and the program was designed to run concurrently withGALE. The basic objectives of PRECP-IV were to study the processing andwet deposition of chemical species (in particular, sulfur and nitrogen)at three scales: (1) for rainbands within frontal storms, (2) for entirefrontal storms, and (3) for the regional scale. PRECP-IV was constructedto take advantage of the opportunity presented by the GALE meteorologicalmeasurements. Thus, PERCP-IV was a chemical measurement program withinthe experimental domain of GALE. The core objectives of GALE were (1)to describe the airflow, mass, and moisture fields in East-Coast winterstorms, with special emphasis on regional-scale and air-sea interactionprocesses, (2) to understand the physical mechanisms controlling theformation and rapid development of these storms, and (3) to develop andtest computerized models for their prediction.</TEXT></DOC>
