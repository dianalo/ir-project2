A number of thesetechnologies are economic at the present time with the estimated economicpotential in excess of 2000 MW. Electricity production potential is about10,000 GWh, which is equivalent to about two percent of total electricitydemand in Canada. However, because the financial criteria for evaluatingthese technologies are more stringent, the energy contribution potentialfrom financially attractive projects is less than the economic potential.The relatively low power puchase rates generally offered by provincialutilities across the country contributes to this difference between economicand financial returns. A concerted policy effort on the part of provincialgovernments to improve power purchese rates and address technical considerationssuch as capacity credits and system interconnection costs and requirementsis required to realize the potential electricity production from renewableenergy sources.</TEXT></DOC>
