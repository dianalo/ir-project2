The ITC's preliminary decisions, made in response to twotrade complaints filed by U.S. producers and processors ofAtlantic salmon, require the Commerce Department to continueits investigation of charges that these imports violate theU.S. anti-dumping act and the countervailing duty law. Theseimports total about $94 million a year.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. producers and processors in Northeastern states,who formed an ad hoc trade group to file the complaints,alleged that the Norwegian government has provided varioussubsidies to Atlantic salmon exporters. They also chargedthat Norwegian salmon has been sold at &quot;unfairly low prices&quot;to U.S. buyers.
