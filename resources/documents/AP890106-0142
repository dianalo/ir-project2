Farmer, who set a Democratic Partyfund-raising record in 1988, announced Friday his candidacy fortreasurer of the Democratic National Committee.   Farmer, who was credited with raising nearly $70 million for the1988 campaign, said he would set a goal of raising at least $100million for the party over the next four years.   When asked for his view of so-called soft money, politicalcontributions outside the limits covering most donations tocandidates and parties, Farmer said, ``The rules are the rules and Irefuse to apologize for raising money at the level of theRepublicans.''   Would he continue seeking soft money?   ``Absolutely,'' said Farmer.   Both parties raised millions of dollars last year fromindividuals who gave up to $100,000 each. That money was used forvoter registration drives and other activities defined asstrengthening local parties rather than directly advocating theelection of candidates for president or Congress.   Individuals are limited to contributions of $1,000 to candidatesfor federal office and $5,000 to political action committees. Thereis a $20,000 limit on individual contributions to national partycommittees.   Farmer, who headed the fund-raising operation for MichaelDukakis, said he didn't know if the Massachusetts governor wouldseek the presidency again in 1992, but added, ``I don't think he'sgoing to be a candidate.''   Sharon Pratt Dixon, the current party treasurer, is not seekinganother term and Farmer is not expected to have serious oppositionfor the post when it is filled when the DNC meets next month.</TEXT></DOC>
