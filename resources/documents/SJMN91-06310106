These people called the two men crooks and put themin a building with bars on the windows.;   The government people took the bankaway from the two men and sold it to a big Texas company.;   Then thegovernment people gave the big Texas company lots of money so the bankwouldn't run out again. The government people also gave the company a veryspecial magic wand that came with the bank.;   The wand is called NOL, and itis wondrous.;   It makes taxes disappear.;   By waving the wand, the big Texascompany that now owns the bank can make taxes vanish for years and years andyears. The money it used to pay in taxes it can now keep for itself.;   Thewand invented by the government people is available only to a select few.;  You, for example, can't have one.;   But individual taxpayers pay for thewands that do get passed around.;   NOL stands for net operating lossdeduction, a tax break that allows corporations to reduce this year's taxes --and next year's taxes, and so on -- because of money lost last year.;  Through the 1980s, the NOL enabled corporations to escape payment of more than$100 billion in income taxes.;   But it is not the largest of the manywrite-offs available to businesses.;   The deduction that corporations cantake for interest paid on borrowed money costs the government nearly $100billion in a single year, dwarfing the amount that NOLs diverted from the U.S.Treasury.;   Ballooning; deductions;   The deduction for interest on corporatedebt has long been part of the U.S. tax code, but in the unchecked frenzy ofthe 1980s, as merger-minded companies took on enormous debt, it ballooned.;  A catalog of other deductions runs to many more billions in lost tax revenue.;  All these are reasons that individual taxpayers are picking up anever-larger share of the U.S. tax burden, while corporations pay a steadilydecreasing share -- corporations such as Temple-Inland Inc., the big Texascompany that got the magic wand when it acquired Guaranty Federal Savings andamp;Loan Association of Dallas.;   That's the savings and loan run by the two menfrom Dallas, Paul Sau-Ki Cheng and Simon Edward Heath. The Wall Street peoplewere from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. Inc.;   By thetime Cheng and Heath were finished, Guaranty Federal was insolvent. Federalregulators seized it in 1988 and turned it over to Temple-Inland.;   As aresult of what the government has charged was &quot;fraudulent bond-trading&quot;transactions, along with illegal dealings that led to the convictions of Chengand Heath, the savings and loan ended up with a net operating loss of morethan $300 million.;   Now, and for many years to come, Temple-Inland can usethose old losses to reduce its taxable income and avoid paying taxes.;   Whatmakes the Guaranty Federal story so remarkable is this:;   First, taxpayersare paying, and will continue to pay, to bail out the failed savings and loan-- that is, to restore depositors' money.;   Then, taxpayers will pay yetagain, to make up for the taxes Temple-Inland won't be paying because itsprofits can be offset by the savings and loan losses incurred years earlier bytwo men now in jail.;   Direct and; indirect costs;   Direct cost of thebailout: an estimated $3.9 billion, which will go straight from you and othertaxpayers to Guaranty Federal and its new owner, Temple-Inland.;   Indirectcost: an estimated $590 million in lost tax revenue. That missing revenue willbe made up by you and other taxpayers -- or added to the federal debt, inwhich case you'll pay the interest charges on it.;   Guaranty is only one ofhundreds of savings and loans that taxpayers are rescuing, Temple-Inland onlyone of scores of companies profiting from the bailout. The ultimate cost totaxpayers: a half-trillion dollars.;   The people responsible for this bailoutare in Washington -- a succession of Congresses and presidents, administratorsand regulators, Democrats and Republicans -- who write the government rulebook.;   The rule book is the accumulation of laws and regulations thatprovides the framework for the country's economy, affecting everything fromthe taxes you pay to whether your job is moved to Mexico.;   All this hashappened through:;   (check) The enactment of laws and regulations crafted forthe benefit of special interests.;   (check) The failure to enact laws andregulations that would ensure a level economic playing field for everyone.;  (check) The refusal to rescind long-outdated laws that favor selectedinterests.;   Cruising; tax-free;   Some people profit handsomely from thissystem. Like Ted Arison of Miami Beach, Fla., and Tel Aviv.;   You may notrecognize the name. But you've probably seen the TV commercials for hiscompany -- the ones starring Kathie Lee Gifford who, in assorted costumes,dances and sings across the decks of the &quot;fun ships&quot; of Carnival Cruise LinesInc.;   From 1985 to 1988, Carnival Cruise Lines produced total profits of$502.5 million.;   The corporate income tax rate during those years rangedfrom 46 percent in 1985 to 34 percent in 1988, meaning that Carnival paidabout $200 million in federal taxes.;   Right?;   Wrong.;   Carnival paid nota cent in U.S. corporate income taxes on that half-billion dollars in profits.Its corporate tax rate was zero.;   That's because Carnival benefits from agovernment rule book that exempts shipping companies incorporated in foreigncountries from having to pay U.S. income taxes.;   Although Carnival's officesare in Miami, and its Caribbean-bound ships leave from Miami, the company isincorporated in Panama. Its subsidiaries are organized in Liberia, theBahamas, the British Virgin Islands and the Netherlands Antilles.;  Carnival's situation is not unique. Hundreds of corporations have eliminatedor drastically reduced their federal tax bills through similarspecial-interest tax laws.;   Your tax dollars; as part of two pies;   Tounderstand why you pay the taxes you do, think of your paycheck as part of twogovernment pies.;   The first pie is made up of total income taxes collectedfrom all individuals and all corporations. The amount that you pay as anindividual is determined, in part, by the amount Congress says companiesshould pay.;   If Congress collects more from businesses, you pay less. IfCongress says some businesses may pay reduced taxes, you pay more.;   Thesecond pie is made up of combined income taxes and Social Security taxescollected from individuals. The amount that you pay if you earn, say, between$25,000 and $35,000 is determined, in part, by the amount that Congress sayspeople who earn more than $100,000 should pay.;   If Congress collects morefrom people at the top, you pay less. If Congress says people at the topshould pay less, you pay more.;   Now consider a few statistics drawn from aPhiladelphia Inquirer analysis of a half-century of government tax andeconomic data. They will explain why you are accounting for an ever-largerslice of the two government pies.;   (check) During the 1950s, when moreAmericans than ever attained middle-class status, the federal governmentcollected $478 billion in combined individual and corporate income taxes inthe decade.;   Of that, corporations paid 39 percent, individuals 61 percent.;  During the 1980s, individual and corporate income tax collections soared to$4 trillion.;   Of that $4 trillion, the corporate share dwindled to 17percent, the individual share swelled to 83 percent.;   (check) Corporationshave succeeded in reducing their share of the tax burden, in part through aprovision in the government rule book that permits a virtually unlimiteddeduction for interest on debt.;   During middle-class America's golden years,the 1950s, corporations paid $44 billion in interest on borrowed money andmore than four times that amount, $185 billion, in federal income taxes.;   Bythe 1980s, an era of frenetic corporate borrowing and unabashed congressionalsupport of special interests, that pattern was reversed.;   (check) Congresshas written the government rule book so that Social Security taxes consume anever-larger share of the weekly paychecks of low- and middle-income Americans,while the affluent are better able to cope with those increases.;   As aconsequence, the average family or individual has less money to spend forhousing, food, clothing and education.;   Long ago, businesses borrowed moneyto build plants, to buy equipment and to make new products, thereby creatingjobs. In those times, there was a certain logic to allowing companies to writeoff the full interest expense on their tax returns.;   But in the 1980s, theinterest deduction became an instrument to dismantle the United States -- notto build it.;   Businesses borrowed money to raid other businesses and selloff their assets. That led to the closing of factories, the elimination ofmiddle-income jobs and the paying of astronomical sums to owners, investorsand corporate executives who brought it all about.;   All this was subsidizedby taxpayers -- through the deduction for interest payments.;   Beyondcorporations that do not pay their fair share of taxes because of apreferential government rule book, there is yet a darker side to the story,one with bleaker implications for the American middle class.;   No new jobs;from debt frenzy; The expenditure of those hundreds of millions of dollarsborrowed, and the millions of dollars that were -- and will be -- paid ininterest did not create a single new job.;   Consider two companies: USGCorp., better known by its former name, United States Gypsum Co., andBurlington Holdings Inc. USG manufactures and markets building products and isthe country's largest producer of gypsum wallboard. Burlington makes an arrayof textiles, including fabrics for clothing, carpets and upholstery.;   Overthe past two years, USG reported total operating income of $487 million.;  Interest expenses totaled $589 million, wiping out all of the operatingincome.;   Federal income taxes paid: zero.;   Over the past two years,Burlington reported operating income of $389 million.;   Interest expensestotaled $504 million, wiping out all of the operating income.;   Federalincome taxes paid: zero.;   To meet their interest payments, USG andBurlington, whose debt grew out of the corporate takeover wars encouraged bythe government rule book, did what so much of the rest of corporate Americahas done in the same situation:;   They slashed their workforces. And theyreceived a tax break for doing it.;   What's more, the very deduction thatwipes out tax bills now -- the interest write-off -- creates yet anothertax-avoidance mechanism to shelter future profits for USG, Burlington Holdingsand many others: the net operating loss deduction -- the magic wand that makestaxes disappear.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DONALD L.
