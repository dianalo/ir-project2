An explosion with earthquake force Wednesday flattened thePacific Engineering Production Co., a maker of ammonium perchloratefor rocket fuel, and a neighboring marshmallow plant in Henderson,Nev., killing two people and injuring more than 300 people.   That night, fire broke out at the 62-story First Interstate Bankbuilding in downtown Los Angeles and quickly enveloped four floorsof the state's tallest skyscraper. One worker died when he wastrapped in an elevator, and 40 people were injured, authoritiessaid.   Early Thursday, explosions set off fires at a Shell Oil Co.refinery in Norco, La. Six people were found dead, and one wasstill missing Friday, according to Shell. Forty-two people wereinjured as windows shattered and doors and roofs were torn offthroughout Norco.   The accidents triggered talk about fire prevention andfirefighting in high-rise towers, handling volatile chemicals andhow to protect neighbors of potentially hazardous operations.   The United Steelworkers of America entered the debate in Nevada,releasing a 1982 letter from a union safety and health technicianwho called Pacific Engineering plant ``one of the worst I have everbeen into.'' USW Local 4856 represents workers at the plant.   On Friday, USW President Lynn Williams issued a statementdenouncing the company and the federal Occupational Safety andHealth Administration for not acting on the union's complaints.   But the company's chairman, Fred Gibson, maintained it had agood record, and state officials generally supported him.   Jim Barnes, state Industrial Relations director, said PacificEngineering underwent 11 inspections by the state OccupationalSafety and Health Division over five years. The inspectionsresulted in 10 citations, and four fines for incidents he termedserious.   ``There have been problems from time to time, mostly minor,'' hesaid. ``Our opinion is that overall their record has been a good,moderate record.''   The disaster raised worries about a Kerr-McGee Corp. plant amile away which is the only other facility in the United States tomanufacture ammonium perchlorate. The plant shut down voluntarilyafter the blast until more is known about what caused it.   ``We will not resume until we're absolutely certain it's safe,''Kerr-McGee spokesman Paul Reed said Friday. ``But we've beenoperating 35 years without any sort of accident. We think our plantsafety record is exemplary.''   On Friday, Kerr-McGee executives met with city officials amidcalls from frightened residents to shut the facility downpermanently.   ``We've created a monster of fear,'' said Henderson CityCouncilman Michael Harris. ``I don't think anybody other than maybesome of those that really knew the plants knew the potential hazardinside.''   But he said: ``It's too early to say we're going to runKerr-McGee out of town. We have to wait and find out what causedthis. It may create a tremendous war out here.''   In Los Angeles, there was talk of extending the city'srequirement that high-rises built after 1974 have sprinkler systemsto older buildings like the 1973 First Interstate tower, as well.   As many as two-thirds of the city's 765 skyscrapers lacksprinklers, according to fire officials, and City Councilman NateHolden said he will propose a law requiring the systems in allhigh-rises, buildings taller than 75 feet or six or seven stories.   Managers of most of the 521 high-rises built before 1974 haven'topted for expensive ``retrofitting'' with sprinklers and othersafety gear, said Assistant Fire Chief David Parsons. FirstInterstate was installing a $3.5 million sprinkler system, but itwasn't quite completed.   Fire officials Friday called in investigators of the federalBureau Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to assist in determining thecause of the blaze, estimated to have done $450 million damage.Their help was requested because of the severity and scale of theblaze, said Assistant Fire Chief Peter Lucarelli, not necessarilybecause arson is suspected.   Bob Campbell, a spokesman for First Interstate Bancorp,discounted arson speculation prompted by news that 100 workers onthe floor where the fire reportedly broke out might lose their jobsbecause their division was just sold.   In Louisiana, OSHA sent investigators to the damaged Shellrefinery Friday to help determine the cause of the explosion at thecatalytic cracker, which chemical engineers called highly unusual.   Houston Huckabay, chairman of Tech's chemical engineeringdepartment, said he checked a list of 100 refinery fires datingback to 1955 and found none of them involved a catalytic cracker,used to break down crude oil into usable products such as gasoline.   And there had never been a fatal accident at the sprawling Shellrefinery, which had prided itself on its safety record.   ``Until the accident yesterday, the plant had gone 5.5 millionwork hours without a lost-time accident,'' said Fred Foster, plantmanager.   A fire in April 1985 caused some injuries and shut the plantdown until it was extinguished, but nobody was evacuated fromNorco, and the plant was back in business quickly, he said.   Dean Perniciaro, president of Local 4750, Oil, Chemical andAtomic Workers Union, said Friday that the safety record madeThursday's explosion hard to believe.   ``I guess it shows we're just not immune to disasters,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
