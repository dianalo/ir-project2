Thesuccessive addresses of each case were noted. The distribution of staysbetween mining zones and others was compared to an expected distributionbased on censuses. A significant excess was observed in mining zones,both for the number of stays and for the number of person-years. Theexcess was observed for primary lung cancer only. The data seem to indicatethat people with lung cancer have spent a larger part of their life ina mining zone. The reason for that phenomenon cannot, however, be assessedclearly. This could be due to the geographical environment, i.e., thepresence of nickel and asbestos in the soil of some parts of the territory;the observed relationship could also be due, in part, to the effectsof urbanization leading to increased tobacco consumption.</TEXT></DOC>
