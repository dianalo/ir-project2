BarneyFrank before the House ethics committee says the MassachusettsDemocrat will defend himself against false allegations.   ``He's chastened by the events that are true, but he's damned ifhe's going to run from allegations that are garbage,'' StephenSachs said in an interview Monday.   ``Barney's been forthcoming about this publicly. He is equallycertain that there has been a substantial amount of untruthpeddled, or attempted to be peddled, in the public press.''   Sachs, a former U.S. attorney in Baltimore and former Marylandattorney general, said he would be ready by early next week topresent a detailed case that will debunk some of the sex-relatedcharges leveled against the five-term lawmaker.   Sachs' hiring was the latest move by Frank indicating a renewedfeistiness after several weeks in which friends said he wasemotionally down about his prospects.   Frank took to the House floor last week for the first time sincethe allegations about his relations with a male prostitute becamepublic in August. He has maintained a full schedule in his homedistrict and has begun a legal defense fund set up by politicalaides.   Doug Cahn, a spokesman for Frank's congressional office,declined to disclose how much had been contributed to the fund,saying the first public report on the account is due at year's end.   A leading liberal in Congress, Frank has admitted paying StephenGobie $80 for sex in 1985 and subsequently hiring him with personalfunds to serve as a housekeeper and driver from July 1985 throughAugust 1987.   Frank had acknowledged he is homosexual well before the recentpublicity.   Gobie has leveled various charges against Frank that thecongressman has denied. Among those are that Frank knew Gobie wasrunning a prostitution ring from Frank's Capitol Hill apartment andthat Gobie and Frank engaged in sexual activity at the Housegymnasium.   The House ethics committee investigating the Frank case plans toconclude its deliberations by the end of the year, Sachs said,basing his statement on two meetings with the committee's legalcounsel and one with the minority counsel.   ``They want very much to act promptly and want to conclude thematter this year,'' Sachs said.   Members of Frank's staff said they expect the case to come up atleast in a preliminary form at a committee meeting later this week.A spokesman for the ethics committee said the panel's schedule forthis week had not been set by Monday and that committee proceedingsand the agenda are kept confidential.   Sachs has prosecuted several members of Congress and recentlygained attention for his defense of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, who spenttwo years in jail after being cited for contempt of court forrefusing to allow her daughter to visit the child's father.</TEXT></DOC>
