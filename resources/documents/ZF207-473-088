(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>My earliest encounter with typefaces came in the first grade.andP;  I had a choiceof two: cursive and printing.andP;  Changing fonts was easy.andP;  For boldface Ipressed hard on a black crayon, and for italics I used my left hand.Thisnewly discovered typographic control wentlargely unnoticed, thanks toteachers who thought my letters ignore cuneiform than uniform.andM;I finally turned those hen scratches into perfect type with the Macintosh,using sophisticated typographic tools once available only from expensivetypesetting machines.andP;  The Macintosh's abilities are now famous, and typemanufacturers who once saw the Macintosh as a typographical footnote are nowfalling all over themselves to make headlines.andP;  In the wake of these new typedesigns, Apple and Adobe Systems are in a feeding frenzy over fonttechnologystandards, adding further confusion to the issue of which printers andlibraries to buy.andM;As manufacturers of PostScript clones and font utilities fight over theleftovers, users blitzed with new buzzwords such as hints, encryption,men-ics, and font-ID conflicts must also consider the quality of type design.andO;Even if you like a typeface, it may not like your programs, your printer, oryour pocketbook.andM;To keep you afloat, we've compiled a typographic primer, with some basicfacts on how type works and who's making the type you want, as well as somefundamentals of good type design, while warning you of hidden hazards.andP;  We'llalso throw you some lifesaving utilities for font management andmanipulation.andM;The ABCs of Digitized TypeandM;The advent of digital type has made type design more flexible, portable, andaccurate than ever before.andP;  What's more, its movement to the personalcomputer gives you access to virtually any digitized face, delivered on onepiece of affordable machinery.andM;Today, companies such as Adobe (Mountain View, California) and Bitstream(Cambridge, Massachusetts) use large workstations and proprietary software todigitize original typefaces or to convert already digitized outlines toPostScript (Adobe's page-description language) format.andP;  Some companies, likeAdobe, use artificial-intelligence programs to add hinting - the process bywhich quality font rendering is produced at small point sizes onlow-resolution printers (see Figure 1).andP;  Companies with more limitedresources use offthe-shelf font editors such as Fontographer from Altsys(Plano, Texas) to create original Mac typeface designs by using Bezier curves(mathematically optimized lines and arcs).andM;After the originals have been digitized, fonts on the Mac are developed intwo basic formats: bit maps for the screen and ImageWriter output andPostScript fonts for laser printers.andP;  New font technologies, includingAdobe's ATM (Adobe Type Manager) and Apple's outline format (see Fine Printin this issue's DTP section), will allow fonts for display and printing to begenerated from the same PostScript description, but for now, it's a worlddivided.andP;  (Both schemes provide high-resolution type on-screen without thebitmap jaggies we have come to know and hate.)andM;As it is, the screen fonts you see are not what you want.andP;  They're mapped toa crude 72-dot-per-inch (dpi) matrix of square dots or pixels.andP;  Bit maps donot enlarge or reduce without distortion, so fonts loaded into the Systemfile must be optimized for a particular point size to get the smoothestresolution on-screen.andP;  This means you must load screen fonts for every sizeinto your System, since fonts look increasingly jagged the more they'rescaled from an optimized size (see Figure 2).andM;PostScript typefaces, on the other hand, are independent of the screen andconsist of a series of PostScript commands that mathematically define theline paths and arcs that make up each character's outline.andP;  A printerequipped with a PostScript interpreter uses a single outline description of afont to scale it up or down within a range of 2 to 127 points.andM;PostScript fonts are either resident in the printer's ROM or downloaded intoits RAM, and they're substituted for the screen fonts for printing (for moreon PostScript printing, see &quot;Fit to Print&quot; in this issue).andP;  The printer looksfor the outline first in ROM, then in its RAM, next on a hard disk attachedvia a SCSI port to the printer, and finally in the System Folder.andP;  Apple'scurrent System continues to download fonts as needed.andP;  If it can't find aPostScript description for a font, the printer substitutes a similar font-Times for Baskerville, for example - or constructs a bitmapped equivalentthat produces ragged results.andP;  Downloaded fonts stay in the printer's RAMuntil you switch the power off.andM;Type separates into general categories of display and book fonts.andP;  Displayfonts are used for larger text such as titles or headlines and usuallyrequire no hinting.andP;  Book fonts are meant for smaller sizes such as long runsof book, magazine, or newspaper text.andP;  Without hinting, they can provideexcellent results at 600 dpi or higher and proof-quality type from a printerat 300 dpi or less.andP;  With hinting, they can provide excellent results on300-to-400-dpi machines, but some people believe that important designinformation is lost at higher resolutions.andM;On the Font BattlfrontandM;The LaserWriter is built by Apple, but the PostScript interpreter and 35standard fonts (11 faces) resident in the LaserWriter's ROM are licensed fromAdobe.andP;  Most of the typefaces Adobe uses are, in turn, licensed from Linotypeor ITC via digitized originals created by URW (West Germany).andP;  Adobe convertsthese outlines to PostScript format, adding hints and encryption that encodethe fonts in a format only the PostScript interpreter can translate.andP;  Untilnow, this situation treated any downloadable font not playing by Adobe'srules as a second-class citizen.andP;  A printer or font manufacturer wanting toprint with Adobe's encrypted-font technology (classified as Type I fonts)needed to license Adobe's PostScript interpreter or font technology, whichmade printers more costly and type slower to process.andM;Relief was forthcoming.andP;  This year, Bitstream and RIPS broke Adobe'sfont-encryption code.andP;  Bitstream now supplies most of its high-end library inType I -compatible encrypted fonts for use on high-resolution typesettersequipped with Adobe's PostScript interpreter.andP;  RIPS manufacturesPostScript-clone interpreters for use in PostScript-compatible printers.andP;  Atthe same time, font manufacturers such as Bitstream and URW are digitizinghuge libraries of type with hinting schemes of their own.andP;  Apple jumped inwith its QuickDraw (non-PostScript) font technology for producinghigh-quality screen and printer fonts, complete with hints (calledinstruction sets), and made it available to any third-party developer.andM;Adobe responded to this pressure by licensing its font encryption and hintsto other type manufacturers such as AGFA Compugraphic (Wilmington,Massachusetts), Monotype (Chicago), and Varityper (East Hanover, New Jersey)and its interpreter or controller to printer manufacturers such as Canon andAutologic.andP;  If the libraries from these typemakers are converted to the Adobeformat, they will form the largest electronic-type library in the world atabout 6,000 fonts.andP;  Of the 3,000 faces now available in the Linotype library,about 487 are available for the Macintosh from Adobe, including originaldesigns such as the Stone family.andM;The TypemakersandM;More than 25 font companies are currently marketing PostScript downloadablefonts.andP;  Bitstream, formed in 1981 by former Linotype employees, offers stiffcompetition to Adobe.andP;  With the Bitstream Type Library, MacFontware, andSoftFonts for the Macintosh, and with comparable fonts in the PC market,Bitstream is taking the high road to type quality by remaining true tooriginal typefaces.andP;  The majority of its nearly 1,000 faces are available asencrypted, unhinted fonts (classified as Type A) for printing onhigh-resolution printing devices that use Adobe's PostScript interpreter(such as the Linotronic) or as unencrypted, unhinted fonts (Type C) forlow-resolution PostScript printers.andP;  Plans call for hinted fonts (Type B) forprinters equipped with Bitstream's FontWare Typescaling Technology.andM;MacFontware is a 40-face, 16family library of unencrypted, unhinted fontsthat print on LaserWriters and PostScript-compatible clones.andP;  Designed to bedevice-independent, MacFontware installs like Adobe's fonts and deliversproof-quality type at small point sizes on low-resolution machines.andO;SoftFonts, a 35-face, 11family library, are bit-mapped screen and printerfonts designed to print well on QuickDraw printers such as the LaserWriter SCand the ImageWriter.andP;  Bitstream supplies PostScript versions of these faces,which match Adobe's metrics and are used as the resident faces on cloneprinters.andM;AGFA Compugraphic has released its library of CG fonts in the Studio Series.andO;Created in Fontographer format, they were chosen to complement rather thanduplicate what is already available elsewhere.andP;  Its Professional Series willoffer fonts under the company's license with Adobe.andM;URW's 2,000-typeface library is being marketed by The Font Company (Phoenix,Arizona).andP;  As the official digitizing agent for ITC, it digitized many of theoriginal typefaces licensed by companies such as Adobe.andP;  It differs fromAdobe by producing unhinted type, maintaining that hinting requires&quot;generalized&quot; font designs with reduced control-point information (see Figure3) .It's aiming instead for the high-resolution (greater than 600 dpi)typesetters.andP;  Because of the extra font infolTnation, URW's fonts requiremore disk space and printer memory.andP;  Also, URW faces include many specialcharacters (ligatures) and kerning pairs.andP;  More than 200 faces are currentlyavailable in its Typographic Series.andP;  The Display Series is available asPostScript fonts and as files that can be opened in Illustrator 88 orFreeHand.andM;Kingsley/ATF (Tucson, Arizona) is one of America's largest type foundrieswith 20,000 typefaces.andP;  Its first product, ATF ProType, will be sold inpackages of up to six fonts.andP;  Some packages will offer ATF's hintingtechnology to compete with Adobe's, but the library will be largely displayfaces.andP;  Each package will have utilities to generate screen fonts and modifykerning.andP;  Another product, ATF Type Foundry, is similar to the program ATFuses in-house to digitize fonts and will let users create outlines for theirown fonts,andM;Casady andamp; Greene's Fluent Laser Fonts were some of the first downloadablefonts in Fontographer format.andP;  Now, Image Club (Calgary, Alberta, Canada)plans a 600-typeface library of PostScript fonts on CD-ROM discs.andP;  Fonts willalso be available in editable outlines that can be manipulated in programssuch as Illustrator 88.andP;  Altsys, creator of Fontographer and an earlysupplier of PostScript fonts, is not currently adding to its library but mayhave its fonts distributed by a third party in the future.andM;Other companies marketing type designs worth looking into include Alphabets,T/maker, Electric Typographer, MacTography, Olduvai, Treacy Faces,Springboard Software, Studio 231, EmDash, and DublClick Software.andM;Type and MeterandM;On one level, selecting from this embarrassment of riches is one ofpreference.andP;  Either you like the way type looks or you don't.andP;  But good typedesign is also based on traditional principles of shape, spacing, weight, andrhythm as guided by the eye of a good type designer.andM;Metrics establish the basic height and width of the area surrounding aletter, dictating the spacing, or &quot;set width,&quot;between characters.andP;  If thebasic metrics of a font's set width aren't to your liking, you can changethem in certain programs with kerning controls that adjust the spacingbetween letters and words.andP;  Most page-layout programs have a tracking featurethat allows custom kerning, but kerning can also be set in the typefacethrough the use of kerned pairs that optimize the spacing between certainproblem characters (a capital A next to a capital V, for example).andP;  Awell-designed typeface can have 120 to 500 kerned pairs.andM;The basic building block for a typeface is the em square: The letter M hasthe largest width and height dimensions of any character of the alphabet.andO;Letters are designed on an em square broken into units to establish verticalmeasurements of baseline, meanline, x-height, ascender, descender, and capheight.andP;  Horizontal measurements, called side bearings, maintain the width ofa character.andM;Differences in measurements are nothing new, but now that type manufacturersare producing type with their own metrics on their own machines,discrepancies are more evident from font to font and system to system.andP;  Forexample, if you create a document in Bitstream's Baskerville and open it in asystem that has only Adobe's Baskerville, the first problem will be a font-IDconflict, because the fontID number of Adobe's font is already taken byBitstream (for more on fontID conflicts, see &quot;Fonts by Number,&quot; July '89).andO;Selecting the text and switching the two will correct the ID problem, but theline endings and page breaks might not be the same as before (see Figure 4).andM;The problem is compounded when measuring systems and font attributes such asstem weights (the vertical strokes of a letter) are not kept to traditionalstandards.andP;  Normally a designer makes small variations in the stem weightfrom character to character for a more pleasing look.andP;  Some type designers,however, use the same stem weight for all vertical strokes, compromising thedesign quality and changing the overall set width of a line when comparedagainst the same face from another manufacturer (see Figure 5).andM;Adobe, for example, is standardized to 72 points to an inch, the same as thepixel resolution of the screen.andP;  Bitstream, on the other hand, maintains72.289 points to an inch, in keeping with the original standards of theAmerican Point System.andP;  At large point sizes, this discrepancy can show up,especially if you're trying to maintain the same typographic values whenswitching your publication from traditional typesetting to the Macintosh orwhen you're mixing and matching typefaces on different systems.andM;Bitstream uses the same metrics in MacFontware that it does on the PC, soline endings are the same from the two systems.andP;  Before buying, check displayand book samples for basic character spacing and line-count matches.andO;Bitstream supplies 35 resident faces from 11 families for the Qume CrystalPrint Publisher, for example.andP;  These fonts are Set Width Adjusted (SWA)to exactly match Adobe's resident fonts in the LaserWriter.andM;True to FormandM;The quality of a typeface can also be judged by its adherence to its originalforms.andP;  Often, the roots of an original typeface are blurred by copies madeat different times by different font developers.andP;  In contrast, when Bitstreamwanted to include a Palatino face in its library (Palatino is licensed byAdobe), Bitstream brought in Hermann Zapf, the original designer, tosupervise the design of a new Palatinolike face.andP;  The result was ZapfCalligraphic.andM;In turn, Adobe has introduced a new line called Adobe Originals, whichincludes Utopia and a new version of Garamond that was extensively researchedfrom recasts of original Garamond matrices in the collection of thePlantin-Moretus museum in Antwerp, Belgium.andP;  The Original Series has aspecial 144character Expert Set that features extended sets of ligatures,titling caps, old-fashioned numerals, flourished caps, and more.andM;Nostalgia aside, many designs have been improved by new technologies andbetter printing methods.andP;  Bitstream Charter, for example, straightened serifsto avoid curves, which print poorly on low-resolution machines.andP;  In exchange,a unique typeface was born that was economical in construction and design(see Figure 6).andM;Consistency of stem weights, hairlines, and serifs from character tocharacter (or between italic, bold, and bold italic) also indicates precisionin designing a face.andP;  On the other hand, some letters such as the 0 and A,should vary from the other letters, extending beyond the cap height becauseof an optical illusion that makes them look shorter if they don't.andP;  Toevaluate type, you must also consider its use and mix with other type.andP;  Withthousands of fonts to choose from, don't overdo it.andP;  Pick a few faces thatprovide unique textural contrasts of heavy andsoft, light and dark, serif andsails serif, and you'll have the beginning of a welldesigned page.andM;Future FontsandM;Time will tell if PostScript clones, type libraries, and Apple's newoutline-font technology erode Adobe as a de facto Macintosh type standard.andO;Adobe plans to support Apple's technology with utility-conversion software,but don't expect typeface support for third-party QuickDraw printers orPostScript clones.andP;  To compete, clones may need hinted typefaces of their ownand their own conversion utilities to support Apple's new font technology.andM;Service bureaus will also be under pressure to support the typefaces andprinters customers eventually choose.andP;  Supporting and fixing incompatibilities from font-ID conflicts and different metrics may result in highercharges from your bureau and more work and expense for you.andP;  Adobe's ATM mayreduce your reliance on screen fonts, but before you drag them into thetrash, consider the expense involved.andP;  Many designers use screen fonts lentfrom their service bureau.andP;  Switching to ATM will require the printer font aswell.andM;Users concerned about typefaces and printers may see Adobe's fonts as theirsafest choice, at least for now.andP;  They are proven performers on thousands ofinstalled printers and well supported at the service-bureau level.andP;  Inaddition to Adobe's own type design releases, more are on the way fromlicensees, but not necessarily with the same metrics.andP;  For those who wanttheir typefaces to look good on printers of varying resolutions, Adobe'shints are the envy of the industry, and ATM will work on any Adobe font youown.andM;Even so, limiting yourself to one type manufacturer may deny you some uniquetype faces, and you won't be able to take advantage of the savings offered bycompetitive fonts and printers.andP;  It's possible to mix and match, but only byshopping around, asking the right questions, and defining your output needswill you and your Mac be able to put on - to use a bad pun - a happy face.andM;Font ToolboxandM;FontDisplay by Jeff Schulman prints information about the fonts installed onyour Mac.It canprint a font's entire ASCII character set, including itskeystroke combination, its location on-disk, its ID number, the sizesinstalled, and the characters per pica for a selected size.andP;
