<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-0160 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method for magnetic surveys of iron materials is developed which preventsvibrational noise from being caused during the transfer of the sensorby miscellaneous iron materials in and around the survey sate. Experimentswith the method are conducted. A double-coil magnetic gradient measuringdevice is used to obtain several sets of five measurements made underthe same conditions. Each set of measurements are made with varying distancesbetween the sensor and magnet. Data once stored on a micro-floppy diskare transferred to a microcomputer for processing for noise reductionand profile refinement. Then, stacking is carried out and results aredisplayed on an X-Y plotter. Original and processed data are comparedto demonstrate that the stacking method can greatly improve the S/N ratio.Application of the stacking method to each set of recorded measurementsserves to clearly identify maxima and zero points, making it easy todetermine the period and amplitude accurately. This reduces errors incalculations of magnetic quantities. It is also revealed that the stackingcan greatly reduce vibrational noises including those caused by personnelwalking in the site.
