Dubai has combined modest oil income with a centuries-oldmerchant tradition to make itself the major port in the southernend of gulf, the most important local trading partner of Iran.   ``The dream is to be the Hong Kong of the 21st century,'' saidSultan Ahmed Bin Sulayen, chairman of Dubai's massive Jebel Alifree zone, a $2.5 billion facility that includes what Dubai says isthe world's largest man-made harbor.   The city-state is already a major transit point for cargo _ muchof it heading across the gulf to Iran. That flow collapsed in theearly years of the war and is just now recovering.   Although Dubai has weathered the war and a dropoff in oilrevenues, most businessmen believe ``the end of the war will bepositive,'' said Daniel Greenwald, executive vice president of theAmerican Business Council of Dubai.   Shipping officials in Dubai, who insisted on anonymity, saidthat while Dubai has gained revenues in repairing war-damagedships, it has lost business at its container ports and at shipyards.   ``You can go to a hell of a lot of places for a half a milliondollars,'' said one, referring to the cost of war-risk insurance inthe Persian Gulf for a big container ship.   Greenwald said the war also has probably deterred somebusinessmen from making major investments in Dubai.   Many traders are also hoping Dubai's historic role as a transitroute for Iranian cargo will carry on as Iran rebuilds after thewar.   Even during the war, thousands of Iranians a month fly to DubaiInternational Airport, the busiest in the Middle East, to shop inDubai's famed souks, or markets. The Iran Air jetliner downed byU.S. Navy missiles in early July was headed for Dubai.   ``They come in the airport from Bandar Abbas. ... They shop,they load the dhows (boats) down, they go back again,'' saidAbdulla Abul-Houl, foreign relations director for Dubai's Chamberof Commerce.   The waterfront is piled with new washing machines, tires, carparts and sometimes whole cars destined for Iran aboard thehand-built little wooden dhows that ply the gulf.   The Iranians are part of an exotic mixture of visitors andexpatriates from India, Pakistan, the Philippines and the West whooutnumber Dubai's locals by at least 2-1 in the population of490,000.   Many of the foreigners are lured by Dubai's tolerance in an areawhere Islamic law and customs predominate. Its high-rise hotelsfeature British-style pubs, Lebanese nightclubs and Japaneserestaurants.   Entertainment ranges from a grassy golf course to ice rinks,complete with an ice hockey league.   Dubai is also tax-free, and relatively free of the red-tape andoppressive security that dim the allure of many Middle Easterncountries.   ``Its like utopia,'' said Robinson, who is among Dubai's moreenthusiastic backers.   But the lack of local labor means companies must import workers,often from Sri Lanka or India, at wages of $140 to $220 monthly foran unskilled worker.   Dubai's location midway between Europe and the Far East has madeits airport one of the busiest transit points in the world.   Its massive dry docks are booked months in advance for shiprefittings, despite the dangers of the gulf.   Bin Sulayim said Dubai hopes by the end of this year to pass anoffshore-company law and is considering offshore banking, a movethat would place Dubai in competition with the island nation ofBahrain farther north in the gulf.   Companies such as Kodak, General Motors, Toyota and Polaroidhave established regional administrative or service centers here,some responsible for territories stretching from Greece in Europeto Kenya in Africa to Singapore in Southeast Asia.   ``You don't have to go down and persuade government officialswhy they want another business in town,'' Greenwald said.   ``Trade is in the blood,'' said Bin Sulayem. He noted that whenthe United States banned imports of Iranian pistachio nuts, Dubaitraders bought huge quantities at depressed prices, then processedand bagged them and exported them to America.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs July 27</NOTE></DOC>
