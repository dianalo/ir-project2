The Massachusetts governor also plans to make a speech onU.S.-Soviet relations a day or two after President Reagan wraps uphis Moscow summit, according to aides.   Dukakis, who expects to clinch the party's presidentialnomination in the final round of primaries next week, said in aninterview that he anticipates making a quick campaign swing withhis vice presidential running mate shortly after the convention.   Dukakis declined to comment further on his selection of a vicepresidential candidate, although he acknowledged he has beenadvised by members of Congress and others to pick someone who isregarded as a moderate or conservative to help reassure voters inthe South and West.   ``I'm not looking for a clone of myself,'' he said.   The Massachusetts governor shrugged off Jesse Jackson's recentcriticisms that he is too conservative, saying, ``I don't see anydeep division'' that would mar the unity of the party's convention.   ``I don't see anything that can't be resolved,'' he said.   In the meantime, Dukakis' aides are converting as many delegatesas they can. Campaign sources said as many as 25 Oklahoma delegatespledged to dropout candidates Albert Gore and Richard Gephardt mayenlist, perhaps as early as today. Other such converts could comefrom Kentucky, and the campaign is trying to win over some of Sen.Paul Simon's Illinois delegates.   Dukakis' comments came as fresh public opinion polls show himrunning ahead of Vice President George Bush, the locked-inRepublican nominee. Dukakis said he believes his success thus faris due in part to the ``steady, consistent'' campaign he has run,but also because ``there really is a strong desire for change.''   ``The cycle has come around here,'' he said.   Dukakis and his aides have begun to direct their energies towardthe fall campaign, even as they go about wrapping up the delegatesneeded to clinch the nomination. They have hired a new presssecretary, Dayton Duncan, and expect to add an additionalspeechwriter to the staff shortly.   Dukakis hopes to use the five weeks between the end of theprimaries and the convention to get off to an early start againstBush _ and keep the focus on the issues they want to raise and noton the ins and outs of the vice presidential selection process.   ``They will be a couple of highly thematic trips in which wewill do our best to get you guys to do something other thanpolitical horserace stories,'' said Chris Edley, the campaign'sissues director. ``Something to keep the campaign themes in the eyeof the voters.''   Dukakis frequently says that he does not intend to concede anystates to Bush in the fall, and Leslie Dach, the campaign'scommunications director, said one purpose of the pre-conventiontraveling is to reinforce the impression that ``we can winelectoral votes in every region of the country.''   Aides said the first extended trip is a Southern swing the weekfollowing the end of the primary season in which Dukakis will speakabout drugs and crime issues. Dukakis tentatively plans stops inNorth Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Texas, including a visit tothe Texas Democratic Convention on June 18. That will mark hissecond trip to Texas since the state's primary on March 8 _ heattended a huge barbecue with the state's Democratic hierarchy lastweek _ and apparently reflects a decision to campaign hard in thestate where Bush got his political start.   A trip is tentatively being planned for the end of June to keyindustrial states, perhaps Michigan and Illinois, in which Dukakiswill address economic issues.   The governor is expected to travel to New York, New Jersey andPennsylvania sometime around July 4, and a trip to California andperhaps one other West Coast state is being planned.   In addition, Dukakis may travel to Salt Lake City to address theU.S. Conference of Mayors the week after the primaries, and alsomay make a quick trip to California on June 22 to speak to aconvention of the American Federation of State County and MunicipalEmployees union.   Dukakis will spend the balance of his time working in hisstatehouse office. He envisions ``three days a week in Boston doingmy job during the day, and having the evenings free for briefings,discussions on everything from the platform to general issues to arunning mate.''   The governor also has set aside time for a vacation with hiswife Kitty during June, most likely on Cape Cod.</TEXT></DOC>
