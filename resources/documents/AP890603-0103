Hundreds were wounded.   The troops cut a violent swath through the heart of Beijing toget to the the square, rolling through barricades and surgingmasses on the surrounding streets.   By 3:30 a.m., soldiers and riot police had surrounded Tiananmen,boxing off several thousand students and supporters concentratedaround a monument to revolutionary heroes in the center.   A half hour later, lights were turned out. The square was indarkness.   ``You have to give up all hope,'' students said over theirloudspeaker at the monument. ``You have to give your life to themovement.''   Students sang the ``Internationale,'' the communist anthem.   At 4:30 a.m., armored personnel carriers entered the square andtroops began moving slowly toward several thousand studentsclustered around a monument to revolutionary heroes in the center.   Sporadic gunfire could still be heard on the outskirts of thesquare as troops shot at crowds of thousands. The death andcasualty toll was believed to be mounting rapidly. Ambulances andbicycle pedicabs went back and forth hauling away the wounded.   One man was seen shot in the back, another in the head.   An official loudspeaker on the square announced that the troopswere moving in to clear the area as soldiers prepared to advancefrom all four sides.   Ho Te-chien, a Taiwanese singer who defected to China in 1983and has been active in the student movement, urged the students toleave. ``We're not afraid to die, but we've already lost too muchblood,'' he said over a student loudspeaker.   A 33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty, set up bystudents last week, remained standing.   The main streets leading to the Tiananmen, China's symbolicpolitical center, were sealed. Thousands fled from the square,where hundreds of thousands of people had gathered to supportstudents in the third week of a sit-in.   The assault came two weeks after Premier Li Peng declaredmartial law in Beijing and sent troops to the city. Hundreds ofthousands of residents responded by blocking roads with trucks andtheir bodies.   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III saidSaturday the situation in China had become ``ugly and chaotic.   ``This will disturb the United States government, and willdisturb the American people, considerably,'' he said. The secretaryhinted that there could be repercussions to the Chinesegovernment's use of violence.   The standoff between troops and protesters had been tense butlargely peaceful for weeks, with soldiers seemingly reluctant orunable to move against the crowds until the first widespreadviolence broke out Saturday afternoon.   A doctor from the Fuxing Hospital in western Beijing, wheretroops began firing on street people, said the hospital had takenin 15 dead and so many wounded they had to be put in garages.   A doctor from another hospital said 12 people died there.   One soldier was killed when he was run over by an armoredpersonnel carrier rushing toward the square, and another man wasreported shot to death in a street clash elsewhere.   A Swedish visitor, Tom Hansson, said he saw three people shot todeath in clashes south of the square.   ``The government is fascist! How can they do this to me? How canthey do this to the people?'' cried a 28-year-old man who was shotin the leg.   Most of those shot on the square were hurling rocks at thetroops and people close to their front lines.   A government loudspeaker on the square charged the students with``counterrevolutionary turmoil'' and said the military was takingnecessary means to end their rebellion.   Sporadic clashes and dozens of injuries were reported onSaturday as soldiers made several attempts to reach the square.   They retreated momentarily under barrages of rocks, shoes andother objects, then resumed their most violent push at about 8 p.m.Saturday, firing weapons and using tear gas and clubs as they movedtoward Tiananmen.   Thousands of troops armed with rifles marched up the east sideof the square, beating people who got in their way. Students threwMolotov cocktails and other objects at them.   One armored personnel carrier rammed into a burning bus onChangan Avenue, the main street running along the square, and wastorched by students. Two people inside were dragged out by thecrowds and beaten severely.   Other armored personnel carriers drove up and down the avenuesmashing down lane dividers and other barriers set up by citizensto block the army's way.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
