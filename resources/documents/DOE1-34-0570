No statistically significant difference in incidencerate was found for any of twelve disease categories examined. Early developmentof a high skin cancer rate, as reported within five years of first exposureat a coal hydrogenation plant in Institute, West Virginia, did not occur.Exploratory analysis indicated trends among gasification plant workersin disease incidence with increasing years of service and increasingoccupational exposure levels for chronic bronchitis and mental diseases.Particulate exposures in workers' homes were of the same order as exposuresat the gasification plant and further study of residential air pollutionlevels is recommended. 21 refs., 2 figs., 80 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
