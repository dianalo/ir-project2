Boesky is due back at the minimum-security prison at Lompoc,Calif., about the end of the month, Ed Wolahan, the prison'ssupervisor of education, said Tuesday. The furlough began lastThursday.   The purpose of Boesky's furlough and his whereabouts were notknown. Boesky attorney Leon Silverman declined to comment on thefurlough.   The New York Post reported today that Boesky was spending histime in Stamford, Conn. The paper also published photos that showedBoesky with a scraggly white beard and long locks reminiscent ofthe late, eccentric millionaire Howard Hughes. It said the pictureswere taken two days ago.   Wolahan said Boesky applied for the temporary release, which wasapproved by the prison warden. Wolahan said inmates who requestfurloughs must demonstrate a need for the release, but he wouldn'tdisclose Boesky's reasons.   Boesky on Nov. 14, 1986, paid $100 million and agreed to pleadguilty to one felony to settle charges in Wall Street's biggestinsider trading scandal.   The 52-year-old former arbitrager is eligible for release ongood behavior from a three-year term at the Lompoc Prison Camp nextApril. He entered the prison, where he has been working on acleanup crew making 11 cents an hour, in March 1988.   A federal judge in Manhattan in April denied a request to reduceBoesky's sentence on the grounds that information Boesky gave thegovernment led to more than a dozen other civil or criminal casesin the United States and Britain. The judge noted Boesky'scooperation but said his sentence was ``not unjust.''   Boesky provided information that resulted in a record $650million plea-bargain settlement by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. andthe indictment of former Drexel junk-bond financier Michael Milken.   As part of his cooperation agreement with federal authorities,Boesky is expected to be the key witness at Milken's trial,scheduled for next year.</TEXT></DOC>
