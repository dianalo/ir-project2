Its founding editor, Rufus Porter, advocated belief in a&quot;Creator God&quot; in the magazine's premier issue.;    The current editor,Jonathan Piel, has withdrawn his assignment for me to write the column knownas &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; solely because I believe in a Creator God and donot believe in Darwinian evolution or abortion.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  IN THE BEGINNING . . .DISCRIMINATION AGAINST BELIEVERS IN CREATORGOD  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Forrest M. Mims III, former writer of &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; column inScientific American, wrote this article for the St. Paul Pioneer Press inresponse to a column by medical ethicist Arthur Caplan.See also related article on this page.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at theUniversity of Minnesota, endorsed my dismissal even though the only example ofmy writing he had read was one of my three columns in Scientific American.;   Caplan even took on the American Association for the Advancement of Sciencewhen he wrote that science magazines have a right to discriminate. Based on astudy of the facts, the Committee on Scientific Freedoms and Responsibility ofthe AAAS wrote, &quot;A person's private behavior or religious or political beliefsor affiliations should not serve as criteria in the evaluation of articlessubmitted for publication.&quot;;    Caplan wrote, &quot;I believe Mims is not qualifiedto write a regular column about science for the general public.&quot;;    I was sosurprised by this statement that I called Caplan and asked what he knew of mybackground. He was unaware that for 20 years I have earned a living by writingmore than 50 books and many hundreds of articles and papers for some 75magazines, journals and newspapers.;    He didn't know that I have designed,assembled and operated virtually every day for 18 months the only ground-basedtotal ozone monitoring station between California and Florida at my latitude.;   He had no knowledge of my development of infrared travel aids for theblind, my photographic study of the life cycle of the black widow spider, mytwo-year program to measure the sun's ultraviolet light every day, theinstruments I have designed to measure the reflectance of leaves and otherobjects, my study to identify killer bees by the frequency of their wing beat,and the hundreds of other investigations I have conducted.;    ScientificAmerican knew about my qualifications and never once questioned my record as awriter about science and engineering.;    The editorial staff of the magazinepraised my work, and Jonathan Piel, the editor, stated the day before hedismissed me: &quot;There's no question that on their own merits the columns arefabulous. If you don't do them for us you ought to do them for somebodybecause they're great. What you've written is first rate; it's not an issue.It's the public relations nightmare that's keeping me awake.&quot;;    Even thoughthe senior editorial staff of Scientific American endorsed me to the end, Iwas dismissed from &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; and that venerable column waskilled after 38 years of publication solely because the editor was afraid hemight be embarrassed if my personal belief in a Creator God became known.;   Had he accepted my written agreement that I would never use the column as aforum to espouse my beliefs there would be no problem.;    For itsblacklisting and overt religious discrimination, Scientific American has beenchastised by the AAAS, the ACLU, Jews for Morality, editorial writers and manyindividual scientists and engineers.;    It's supremely ironic that Caplanused his First Amendment rights to trample mine when he wrote, &quot;Mims deservedto be fired.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  FORREST M.
