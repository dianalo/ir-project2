The presentation of the new buyout offer came at what was to bethe opening session of a new round of contract negotiations betweenflight attendants and United.   United's flight attendants have been working without a contractfor two years. The airline's management has been seeking salary andwork rule consessions from the attendants, union officials said.   Patricia Friend, outgoing president of United's flightattendants union, refused to comment on Wednesday's talks, only toconfirm that a revised employee buyout plan had been presented.   Joe Hopkins, a UAL spokesman, also refused to comment on thetalks.   Analysts believe the management buyout plan will value thecompany at $210 to $240 a share, or a total of $4.75 billion to$5.42 billion.   It is believed officials of the Chicago-based company areseeking ironclad commitments from lenders and the company's threemajor unions before publicly announcing any buyout offer.   The previous buyout effort, led by United's management, pilotsand British Airways PLC, failed in October when lenders refused tofinance it.   The lenders cited the strong opposition of the Machinists union,which represents about 25,000 of UAL's 70,000 employees.   Officials of the United chapter of the Air Line PilotsAssociation and the Machinists union have refused to comment on thelatest buyout proposal.   Meanwhile, the New York investment group Coniston Partners hasthreatened to oust 13 of UAL's 15 directors and create afive-member board dominated by the group if the current board failsto sell or restructure UAL.   This week Coniston announced it had increased its stake in thecompany to 11.8 percent, up from 9.7 percent. UAL stock closedWednesday at $176.50 a share, down $5.75, in consolidated New YorkStock Exchange trading.</TEXT></DOC>
