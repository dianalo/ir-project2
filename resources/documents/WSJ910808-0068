State pensions to elderly people with significant privateincomes will be cut, hospital fees imposed, and livingallowances for university students reduced. In acomplimentary set of institutional reforms, the retirementage will be raised gradually from 60 to 65, hospitals willoperate on a commercial basis, people will be allowed to optout of publicly administered health care, and the state'snear monopoly as a provider of low-cost rental housing willbe effectively privatized.</LP><TEXT>   It is New Zealanders' casual work style and assumptionthat adversity is the government's responsibility that theNational Party is trying to change. This budget, and alabor-market reform passed earlier in the year, are the firststeps. Says Ms. Richardson: &quot;We are putting the fiscalproblems of the past behind us. That could not have been donewithout redesigning the welfare state.&quot;   In essence, the National Party government elected inOctober is asking New Zealanders to take more responsibilityfor themselves. To date, most social services have beenprovided on a universal basis; everyone, regardless ofpersonal wealth, could dip into the state's system of freegoodies. Now state spending will be targeted more tolow-income families; others will have to shoulder more of thecost of their preschool and post-secondary education,retirement and medical needs.   All this means a big change for middleclass NewZealanders, concedes Minister of Health Simon Upton. &quot;Giventhat the bulk of New Zealanders are clustered aroundmiddle-income levels, then the sad fact is that expectationshave to be lowered around the middle,&quot; he says. &quot;We canafford to protect low-income earners. But beyond that, therehas to be a sea change in attitude.&quot;   That won't be easy. A recent study of New Zealanders'values by Massey University lecturers Alan Webster and PaulPerry concluded that the country's work culture &quot;hassystematically taught New Zealanders that they can get bywith little effort or skill and yet be guaranteed comfort,luxuries and security in life. It has never really been madeclear that the key to high living standards is how hardpeople work and how skilled and innovative that work is. Ourpast good fortune has enabled us to become one of the mostill-educated, low-skilled `advanced' countries in the world.&quot;   That &quot;advanced&quot; status is wearing thin. Over the past 30years, New Zealand has had the lowest productivity growth,the lowest export growth and the lowest real growth in grossdomestic product among the developed nations. To compensatefor poor private-sector performance, the government has runlarge fiscal deficits since the mid-1970s. There are almostas many New Zealanders receiving state pensions and welfarebenefits, 1.1 million, as there are full-time workers, 1.2million. Altogether the government spends about 30% of GDP onsocial transfers.   This is a far cry from the original purpose of welfare,back in the 1930s, to help people through rough patches likemajor accidents, incapacity and unemployment. Over the years,the state began underwriting certainties like retirement andbrief illnesses, but economic growth lagged behind governmentspending. This budget is a way of asserting a new fiscalbalance, as well as restoring the ethic that social spendingis for the needy.   The Labor Party has been traditionally wedded to the ideaof equality represented by universal access to free socialservices. The fact is, however, that when benefits have to berationed among the whole population, it is the poor who getsqueezed out of services.   Unable to confront that fact, the reforming LaborGovernment of the 1980s tried to draw quite fundamentaldistinctions between its free-market economic policy and itsstatist social policy. It was prepared to force business tocompete in world markets, but it was not prepared to rollback the social-security blanket. The National Party, bycontrast, argues that the country's overweening welfare stateundermined the very goals of Labor's economic policies: Aninnovative, entrepreneurial culture cannot be fostered in astate that smothers its citizens with freebies and subsidies.   By and large, New Zealand business people have supportedthe 1991 budget, though the short-term reaction of thefinancial markets was mixed. After seven years of beingweaned off state subsidies, business is keen for thegovernment to get its welfare spending under control andtired of being squeezed by high real interest rates. Andthough New Zealanders are disturbed by an unemployment ratethat has reached 9.5%, they realize the system isunsustainable. Many people are going to end up paying morefees because of the changes, but the public appears to havereluctantly accepted the new reality.   There are many special interests, however, such aspensioners and labor organizations, who oppose it stridently.The elderly, in particular, are outraged: &quot;absolute thievery&quot;one activist called the budget. Their anger carries somepolitical risk for the government, as pensioners constitute asignificant portion of National Party support.   No one wins elections simply by taking things away. Inreturn for a leaner public sector, the National Party now hasto deliver on its promise of economic growth.   ---   Ms. Smith is an executive assistant to New Zealand'sminister of finance.</TEXT></DOC>
