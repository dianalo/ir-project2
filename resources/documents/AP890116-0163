A former party chief and dozens of officialshave lost their jobs.   The scandal involved the Adriatic fishing village of Neum, whichwas turned into a chic playground for top communists.   The scandal also may have hastened the departure of PremierBranko Mikulic, who in December became the first government chief incommunist Yugoslavia to resign.   Like other politicians implicated in the scandal, Mikulic comesfrom Bosnia, once seen as the country's most repressive anddogmatically communist republic and now increasingly tainted bycorruption.   Neum, 75 miles southwest of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, wastransformed in just 10 years from a sleepy seaside village to aresort of glittering white marble villas.   Hundreds of top Bosnian officials reportedly built private villaswith illegal bank loans obtained with the connivance of local bankofficials.   In return, the bankers reportedly received political favors andrapid promotions.   The affair has thrown a sharp light on the growth of corruptionin Yugoslavia since the death in 1980 of Josip Broz Tito, whoprevented the state-run media from reporting corrupt practices amongofficials during his time as leader.   Bosnian officials deny anything is distinctly bad about theirregion, saying that corruption is widespread in Yugoslavia's fiveother republics.   ``I don't understand why they are only after us, since similarloans were taken by almost every Yugoslav who had friends working inbanks,'' said one ranking Bosnian official accused of involvement inthe Neum scandal. He spoke only on condition of anonymity.   But Bosnia and its senior officials have been at the center oftwo of the nations biggest corruption scandals. According to aSarajevo television report, the two scandals have led to the ousterof about 2,000 leading politicians, managers, police officers andother officials.   In September 1987, Yugoslavia's vice president, Hamdija Pozderac,resigned after being implicated in a Bosnian agricultural company,Agrokomerc, that issued uncovered bills of exchange worth theequivalent of nearly $1 billion.   The managers of Agrokomerc, now on trial, reportedly relied ontheir influence with local politicians to persuade banks to issuethe uncovered bills.   In October, Milanko Renovica, national Communist Party chief in1986-87, resigned from the ruling Politburo over the scandal in Neum.   According to press reports, he used his influence to obtainillegal loans that financed a mansion in Neum, several apartments inSarajevo and an opulent lodge near his native village in the Bosnianmountains.   Todo Kurtovic, the Communists' top ideologue throughout the1970s, was expelled from the party in December on grounds that hesecured seven unusually favorable loans worth the equivalent of$90,000 to build his Neum villa.   According to press accounts neither confirmed nor denied byauthorities, most of the villas of Bosnian officials in Neum werebuilt free by Bosnian companies and covered in white marble obtainedat ``ridiculously low prices.''   The real-estate scandal, first uncovered by Bosnian journalistsand later publicized by the press in Belgrade, has now led to thereplacement of almost all of Bosnia's ruling elite.   They face confiscation of their property and even criminalcharges, press reports say.   Mikulic has publicly denied widespread allegations that he wasimplicated in the real-estate scandal. State-run newspapers,however, published a list of landowners in Neum and said Mikulic'swife owns a plot acquired under ``suspicious circumstances.''   In an account similar to previous press reports, the head of abank branch in Sarajevo, Dragan Djodjic, said in an interviewBosnian politicians qualified for loans by having top bankexecutives order a brief transfer of foreign currency from thesavings account of a Yugoslav working abroad to the applicant'saccount.   This, he explained, would temporarily provide the politician withthe foreign currency, on the books, that he needed as collateral tosecure the loan, which would then be immediately approved.   The hard currency funds would immediately be returned to theoriginal account, making the transaction difficult to trace, Djodjicadded.   Since the repayment terms of the long-term loans did not includethe usual adjustment provision for inflation, which hit 250 percentat the end of 1988, repayments will soon be reduced to what theBelgrade newspaper Vecernje Novosti called ``the value of a pack ofcigarettes.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs Jan. 20</NOTE></DOC>
