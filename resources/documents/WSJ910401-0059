The FCC said the alleged violations of its accountingrules occurred in 1988 after Contel set up a unit thatprovided purchasing, supply and warehousing services forContel's phone companies. The FCC said that the phonecompanies apparently paid the purchasing unit $1.4 million&quot;above and beyond the fair cost of goods and servicesprovided to them,&quot; and that as a result, interstate customerswere overcharged $262,400.</LP><TEXT>   The agency noted that Contel has refunded the money tocustomers and has adjusted its books to remove theovercharges. A spokeswoman for GTE, Stamford, Conn., whichacquired Contel last month, said the company intends to paythe fine and close the matter. The spokeswoman also said thatContel voluntarily cooperated with the probe.   The FCC said an audit showed that the purchasing unitearned a rate of return of 19.3% in 1988, well above theallowed 12% rate of return.   The proposed action against Contel is similar, though on amuch smaller scale, to a matter that arose last yearinvolving New York-based Nynex Corp. Nynex's telephonecompany units and the FCC reached a settlement under whichthe phone units paid $1.4 million to end an enforcementaction concerning overcharges of $118.5 million.</TEXT></DOC>
