Three months prior to irradiation 30,000 Toxoplasmagondii organisms of the Beverley strain had been inoculated onto themacula of eye in each monkey via a pars plana approach. Toxoplasmic retinochoroiditisdeveloped in each animal, and lesions were allowed to heal without treatment.During total lymphoid irradiation animals received 2000 centigrays (cGy)over a 7-week period. Irradiation resulted in an immediate drop in totallymphocyte counts and decreased ability to stimulate lymphocytes by phytohemagglutinin.Weekly ophthalmoscopic examinations following irradiation failed to showevidence of recurrent ocular disease despite persistent immunodeficiency.Four months after irradiation live organisms were reinoculated onto thenasal retina of the same eye in each animal. Retinochoroidal lesionsidentical to those seen in primary disease developed in five of six animals.Toxoplasma organisms therefore were able to proliferate in ocular tissuefollowing the administration of immunosuppressive therapy. This studyfails to support the hypothesis that cellular immunodeficiency alonewill initiate recurrent toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis. Results suggestthat reactivation of disease from encysted organisms involves factorsother than suppression of Toxoplasma proliferation. If reactivation occursby other mechanisms, however, cellular immunodeficiency then may allowdevelopment of extensive disease.</TEXT></DOC>
