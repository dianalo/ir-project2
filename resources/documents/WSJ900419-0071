Nomani   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/19/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><IN>AIRLINES (AIR)</IN><LP>   Ask a dozen researchers about the effects of airlinederegulation on fares, and you'll probably get a dozendifferent answers.   Since free enterprise in the skies entered its seconddecade last year, at least 12 studies have tried to measureits impact on fares. Though they may reach similarconclusions on narrow points, the studies often clash onbroad issues: Some researchers pronounce deregulation asmashing success, while others say consumer savings aregrossly exaggerated or nonexistent.</LP><TEXT>   That's because the studies give different weight todifferent factors. The most widely used yardstick is whatairlines call &quot;yield,&quot; or the price charged a passenger foreach mile of travel. But researchers also may consider suchvariables as airlines' changing costs, the rise ofhub-and-spoke systems and the impact of deregulation ondifferent types of travelers.   In the end, how researchers view deregulation may dependon how they treat the following factors.                                                                                                          What's the Time Frame                                                                                                          Almost no one challenges the idea that deregulationbrought immediate benefit to the consumer. In the years afterthe Civil Aeronautics Board stopped setting fares, carriersslashed prices. New entrants flooded the market offeringbargain-basement prices.   But most discount airlines have since vanished, and theairline industry has grown more concentrated. As a result,studies that look at the entire period of deregulation tendto find greater benefits than those that examine a morerecent time frame.   Even critics of deregulation agree that real, orinflation-adjusted, fares remain lower today than they werein 1978 -- the last year of regulation. As of 1988, thelatest year used by most studies, real fares were still 20%lower than 10 years earlier, according to a TransportationDepartment study.   But by 1988, when the industry's merger wave peaked, realfares had stopped falling. Carriers had largely gotten allthe cost-cutting they could out of wage reductions and moreefficient, bigger jets. Moreover, with fewer competitorsvying for passengers, the airlines were under less pressureto sacrifice profit margins to defend their turf.   From 1986 to 1988, real fares dropped only 1% to 3%. Sincethen, they have been edging up. &quot;The trend line of the lastfew years is quite different from what happened immediatelyafter deregulation,&quot; says Severin Borenstein, an airlineeconomist at the University of California at Davis. &quot;Thelongtime trend in falling prices came to an end.&quot;                                                                                                          Distribution of Benefits                                                                                                          National averages for air fares don't reflect what'shappened in many cities. As airlines went out of business andgobbled each other up, many cities were left with only one ortwo major carriers. The lack of competition at these airports-- including Atlanta, Denver and Pittsburgh -- has producedhefty fare increases, some studies show.   The General Accounting Office, a congressional researcharm, found in 1988 that a flight from one of 15 airports withone or two dominant carriers cost an average of 27% more thanone from an airport with more carriers. In a similaranalysis, the Transportation Department found that fares in1988 were 18.7% higher at concentrated airports.                                                                                                          Capacity Constraints                                                                                                          As more travelers have taken to the skies, some airports-- including New York's La Guardia and Kennedy, Chicago'sO'Hare and Washington's National -- have reached theircapacity limits in the past few years.   So, supply and demand in these places has put upwardpressure on prices. This might have happened regardless ofwhether the industry was deregulated -- and thus can'tnecessarily be counted against the concept of freecompetition.   An Air Transport Association study last year concludedthat fares at those four airports were 7% higher thanaverage. Tickets at Orange County, Calif.'s, airport, whichis cramped due to noise restrictions, cost 6% more thanaverage.                                                                                                          Business Travelers                                                                                                          Airline deregulation has been a better deal for vacationtravelers than for people who fly on business. RunzheimerInternational Ltd., a Northbrook, Ill., research company,examined unrestricted coach fares, commonly used by businesstravelers, on 20 heavily traveled routes. Its index of fareson these 20 routes rose 96% during the '80s. That figureisn't adjusted for inflation, which totaled about 50% duringthat period.   Runzheimer's study didn't compare business fares on those20 routes with fares commonly used by leisure travelers.                                                                                                          Carrier's Cost                                                                                                          Factors other than deregulation have put downward pressureon air fares, according to some researchers. Over the pastdecade, they say, airlines have benefited from lower fuelprices and more fuel-efficient jets.   A study financed by the Economic Policy Institute, anonprofit Washington, D.C., organization, concluded thatlower fuel prices account for three percentage points of the22% inflation-adjusted drop in ticket prices that itestimates occurred in the first 10 years after deregulation.   The study also concluded that fares in the 10 years beforederegulation, adjusted for inflation and changes in fuelprices, fell 24% -- more than the comparable 19% drop sincederegulation.                                                                                                          Roundabout Routes                                                                                                          Yield -- the amount charged customers for each mile flown-- is one of the most common fare measures. In a study basedon this measure, the Congressional Budget Office said in 1988that fares had fallen &quot;significantly&quot; since deregulation.   Some researchers, however, argue that this is misleading.They say many travelers now must fly farther to reach a givendestination because of hub-and-spoke systems that collectpassengers from different cities, funnel them to a centralairport and then put them on flights to their finaldestinations.   The Economic Policy Institute says travelers now fly 5% to30% farther than before deregulation, when flights were moredirect. So, yield can decline even though passengers arepaying more for their tickets. Taking increased circuity intoaccount, the institute argues, real fares actually rose 8% to33% in the first decade of deregulation. There is, however,little detailed research on this.                                                                                                          The Bottom Line                                                                                                          One piece of evidence that suggests passengers haven'tbeen gouged by carriers since deregulation is industryprofitability. If carriers were practicing oligopolisticpricing, then presumably it would show up on their bottomlines. So far, it hasn't happened.   During the past two years, airlines were supposed to reapthe benefits of industry consolidation. But their averageprofit margins in those years were only 1.8% and 0.4%,respectively, according to Value Line Inc. -- well below theaverage for most industries.                                                                                                          Customer Value                                                                                                          Fares may have declined -- but what do you get for yourmoney these days?   Many travelers would probably consider this one of themost important questions about deregulation -- yet, perhapsbecause it's so subjective, studies overlook it.   In the race to slash costs, airlines have jammed moreseats onto planes, shrunk flight crews and cut corners onin-flight services such as meals. They have made it harderfor travelers to change reservations on some discounttickets.   It would be difficult, if not impossible, to measure whatthis adds up to in terms of reduced value -- and to whatextent it offsets the $6 billion that Brookings Institutionanalysts believe deregulation has saved travelers. TheBrookings analysts subtracted $500 million a year fromconsumer savings as the cost of increased flight delays. Butthey didn't account for other negative factors.   ---        What's Happened to Domestic Airline Fares?
