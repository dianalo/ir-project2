She also said:   _Her eyes haven't improved from the just-completed radiationtreatment to combat symptoms of Graves disease, but she iscautiously optimistic. ``I'm so eager to be better that I think I'mbetter,'' she said, acknowledging she still has double vision,especially in the morning.   _She doesn't know why her soaring popularity consistentlysurpasses President Bush's own high ratings. ``I don't threatenanyone. I'm just a nice, fat grandmother,'' she offered as anexplanation.   _Her son, Neil Bush, ``hasn't done anything wrong'' in hisonetime role as a board member of Silverado Savings and Loan. NeilBush has been questioned by federal regulators about the failed Sandamp;L.   Asked whether women should serve in combat, as they did inPanama, Mrs. Bush gave a ``qualified yes.''   ``If I thought a woman physically could pick up someone who waswounded and carry them to safety, if I thought they could throw ahand grenade as far as a man, then I would say fine. ...   ``They can shoot as well. They can fly as well. The only problemI would have is if it risks somebody else's life because theycouldn't throw a hand grenade as far or carry (someone).''   Bush has said he would be willing to hear recommendations fromthe Pentagon about women in combat. The Pentagon's official policyis that women do not serve in combat roles. Women unexpectedlybecame involved in combat in Panama.   Mrs. Bush said ``George doesn't hide'' secrets from her,including the Panama invasion, and that he discusses ideas with herabout world affairs. But Mrs. Bush said she knew something wasafoot even before the president told her the specifics of theinvasion.   ``It was very clear to me that we were having an awful lot ofpeople in the house,'' she said. ``I knew pretty clearly thatsomething was happening.''   Mrs. Bush said she was surprised at how much she enjoys beingfirst lady.   ``I thought I'd like it but I never dreamed that I would loveit,'' she said.   She said her most difficult duty was to attend a memorialservice for the 47 seamen killed in the April 19 explosion aboardthe USS Iowa.   Mrs. Bush met Tuesday with the reporters in the airy West Hallroom of the White House second floor. Her eyes, though tearingslightly, looked less puffy than they have on some recent days.   She said she can ``always tell which of my friends have been tothe grocery store'' when they call to ask about her health aftereading dire reports in supermarket tabloids.   ``They are so fake,'' she said of the tabloids.   Told that it was a first visit to the second floor for one ofthe reporters, she insisted on an impromptu tour.   ``Look at the tourists. Aren't they cute?'' she said, waving toa woman from the window of the room where she keeps her clothes.   On other subjects, Mrs. Bush said:   _She had been ``a little testy'' about an avalanche of letterssaying it's unsafe for the president to attend the Feb. 15 drugsummit in violence-torn Colombia. She said she would prefer thesummit be elsewhere, but ``I can't change his mind or make thosedecisions.''   _She plans to write a book after leaving the White House basedon 30 years of diaries, but says it won't be a ``kiss and tell.''   _``A lot of progress is being made'' in her war againstilliteracy. ``But it's a drop in the bucket. ... We're trying tochange the whole system.''</TEXT></DOC>
