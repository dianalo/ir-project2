Citing new risk to the bank-deposit insurance fund, Mr.Seidman said the agency staff will recommend restrictions onthe two-week-old Delaware law, which has already drawn majorbanks to the state to launch insurance operations.</LP><TEXT>   In an FDIC meeting yesterday, Mr. Seidman said the mostlikely course would be for the agency either to prohibitinsurance underwriting inside banks or restrict it toseparately capitalized subsidiaries. The recommendation alsois expected to apply to bank investments in real estate.   The agency has examined the issue in the past, but hadn'tany reason to act until the Delaware law was enacted. In thewake of the savings-and-loan crisis, in which taxpayers areexpected to pay about $300 billion over the next 10 years,regulators are taking a dim view of exposing the FDIC to newpotential losses. Last year, the bank-deposit insurance fundhad an $800 million loss, marking only the second year itoperated in the red.   &quot;This opens up a whole host of issues about safety andsoundness&quot; of the insurance fund, Mr. Seidman said. &quot;It'stime, given recent developments, to review this issue.&quot;   Already, big banks have announced plans to take advantageof the Delaware law, including Chase Manhattan Corp. andCiticorp, both based in New York.   It wasn't clear how damaging the FDIC's position is forbanks' entry into insurance. If the insurance activity isrestricted to separately established subsidiaries, banksstill might engage in insurance underwriting and brokerageactivities.   Several banks that were contacted yesterday, includingChase Manhattan, were aware of Mr. Seidman's remarks anddeclined to comment.   The FDIC move could set off conflicts between the stateand federal regulatory agencies. Keith Ellis, Delaware statebanking commissioner, met yesterday with FDIC officials todiscuss their concerns. The Federal Reserve Board also isconsidering changes in regulations on bank power and safety,and is expected to make recommendations to Congress, possiblynext year.   The Delaware law allows banks to engage in all aspects ofthe insurance business through separate divisions orsubsidiaries. As much as 25% of a bank's capital could be atrisk in the insurance operation, but assets, liabilities andrecords of the insurance units are to be kept separate fromthose of the bank.   Banks have lobbied furiously for years for the ability tounderwrite insurance, and have won limited activities to sellor underwrite insurance in some states. But because theDelaware law is the most farreaching, bank lobbyists saidthey expect some sort of federal revision, as part of theregulatory give and take.   &quot;It was widely anticipated that the FDIC would look atthis,&quot; Edward Yingling, lobbyist for the American BankersAssociation, said. One likely scenario might be restrictionson allowing banks to issue certain types of insurance, butnot on others, he said.   Regulators also must wrangle with whether the insuranceoperations will be considered units of bank holding companiesor divisions of the banks, a banking regulator said. A groupof five insurance trade associations asked the FederalReserve to block the Delaware law, contending that federalbank holding company regulations bar the sale of insurance bya bank's non-banking subsidiary. The Fed hasn't acted.</TEXT></DOC>
