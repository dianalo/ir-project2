SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Parties working to form East Germany's firstnon-Communist government haggled today over unfilled Cabinetpositions including economic minister, a key role in how fast thecountry shifts to capitalism.   The dominant conservative alliance favors quickly scrapping theCommunist system and unifying with West Germany as soon aspossible, while the Social Democrats want more-gradualprivatization and cuts in subsidies.   ``We made a good bit of headway,'' Prime Minister-designateLothar de Maiziere told reporters after this morning's negotiatingsession.   The Christian Democratic leader said there were still someissues to be ironed out but stressed he will present a completeCabinet list to Parliament at its next session Thursday.   On Monday the talks produced a 24-member Cabinet list that wouldgive 14 seats to de Maiziere's three-party alliance, the leftistSocial Democrats would get seven posts and a smaller liberalalliance three.   But only 11 of the seats actually were filled on Monday. Amongthose not named was the economics minister, who is to be aChristian Democrat.   The division of Cabinet seats came after five days of talks withthe Social Democrats, who finished second to the ChristianDemocrats in East Germany's first free elections on March 18.   The proposed Cabinet brings together the major political partiesand includes a well-known peace activist as defense minister and aLutheran pastor as foreign minister.   Hans-Wilhem Ebeling, the designated minister for economiccooperation from the German Social Union _ a party in de Maiziere'salliance _ said negotiators had another night or two of work aheadbefore the list was complete.   The Christian and Social Democrats still must harmonize theirdiffering views on unification with West Germany _ the top priorityof the new government. At stake for East Germans is how much of thesocialist welfare state will remain once the two countries merge.   Accustomed to generous food and housing subsidies, East Germansare unsettled by the probable loss of many state benefits as theircountry makes the transition to a market-oriented economy.   The tough job of hammering out agreement on union of the Eastand West German currencies falls to the finance minister. SocialDemocrat Walter Romberg, nominated for the job, pledged Monday tofight for a 1-to-1 conversion of East German marks to West Germanmarks.   A West German central bank proposal last month that mostexchanges be made at a 2-to-1 conversion drew angry protests inEast Germany.   Agreement on the Cabinet is a major hurdle that could finallyput in place a democratic government to replace the Communistcaretaker administration that has been running the country sincelast October's pro-democracy revolt.   Social Democrat leader Markus Meckel was nominated to theimportant post of foreign minister, while Rainer Eppelmann, wholeads the Democratic Awakening party that is part of de Maiziere'salliance, was named defense minister.   Although de Maiziere's alliance won the most seats in the400-member Parliament, it is seeking a coalition with the SocialDemocrats to ensure the two-thirds majority needed to enactconstitutional changes to allow quick unification with West Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
