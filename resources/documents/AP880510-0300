Under the agreement between entertainment conglomerate Warnerand Lorimar, a major television producer, 0.415 Warner commonshares would be exchanged for each Lorimar common share.   The deal puts a value of about $14 on each of Lorimar's 47million outstanding common shares, for a total of around $630million. In addition, Warner would assume Lorimar's debt of about$550 million.   A merger between the two entertainment companies had been widelyexpected, since they have been engaged in on-again-off-again mergertalks since early March.   Several conditions are attached to the deal. For example,Lorimar would be able to terminate the agreement if the averageprice of Warner's common stock during the specified period beforethe closing of the merger doesn't result in a price of at least $15a share for Lorimar shareholders.   In that event, and in certain other circumstances, Warner wouldget a fee of $10 million from Lorimar.   Lorimar earlier rejected a $770 million, or $17-a-share,takeover bid from Denver investor Marvin Davis, the former owner ofTwentieth Century Fox Film Corp. Davis, who has indicated he may bewilling to go higher, wasn't immediately available for commenttoday.   Lorimar told Davis in mid-March that it would keep his offer inmind, but Lorimar spokesman Ken Lerer said today the company had nocomment on whether that is still its position.   Lorimar stock fell 12.5 cents to $13 a share in midday tradingon the New York Stock Exchange, while Warner declined 75 cents to$32.87{.   Another condition of the deal gives New York-based Warner anoption to purchase 18.5 percent of Lorimar common stock at $15 ashare. The option can be exercised if Lorimar accepts a higheroffer from a third party.   The agreement requires the approval of each company's board ofdirectors, Lorimar shareholders and regulatory authorities. Underthe deal, Lorimar Chairman Merv Adelson would join Warner's boardas vice chairman.   ``The acquisition of Lorimar Telepictures ... will expand(Warner's) already broad base of leadership in the entertainmentindustry,'' Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross said.   Analysts have suggested that Lorimar's stock is worth between$14 and $20 a share.   Lorimar, based in Culver City, Calif., is a leading producer oforiginal television programming, but in recent years has beentroubled as its ambitious plans to expand into other areasdisintegrated _ sometimes causing the company to incur losses orheavy costs that depressed its earnings.   Lorimar produces such long-running TV series as ``Dallas,''``Knots Landing,'' ``Peoples Court'' and ``Love Connection.'' Ithas 12 hours a week of prime-time TV programming and 16{ hours ofsyndicated programs.   For the first nine months of its current fiscal year, Lorimarposted a net loss of $82.6 million on revenue of $616.8 million.The loss included $45 million in writedowns on five movies and $22million in reserves for possible future losses in its home-videosubsidiary.   The company has replaced managements of both its movie andhome-video units.   In March, several Lorimar shareholders filed a class actionlawsuit against the company in federal court, alleging that Lorimaroverstated its income and net worth and did not reveal problemswith its home-video unit.   Davis has been seeking to get back into the entertainmentindustry since he sold Fox to media tycoon Rupert Murdoch in 1985for $575 million. Davis had owned Fox for four years, but thecompany was beset by persistent losses.   Last year, Davis made an unsuccessful $321.9 million bid for the90.6 percent he didn't already own of Spectradyne Inc., thenation's largest supplier of cable television and pay-per-viewmovies for hotels.</TEXT></DOC>
