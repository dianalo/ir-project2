Several analystsyesterday repeated &quot;buy&quot; recommendations on the stock.   The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 3.38, or 0.69%, to496.80. Advancing issues outpaced decliners, 1,075 to 762.National Market System volume rose to 129,400,000 shares from118,370,000 Wednesday.   Big Board issues were even stronger. The New York StockExchange Composite Index added 2.00, or 0.96%, and the DowJones Industrial Average gained 37.56, or 1.26%, to closewell above the 3000 level at 3016.32.   Traders said yesterday's gains were only partiallyattributable to the earnings news, which in many cases wasfar from stellar. In addition to Apple, both Lotus andSeagate advanced despite reporting decreased earnings.   Lotus reported second-quarter net of 21 cents a share,down from 54 cents in the year-earlier period and offsomewhat from the mean analyst estimate of 24 cents a share,reported by First Call, a unit of Thomson Financial Networks.   Seagate's net income for its fourth quarter, ended June30, was just one cent a share, compared with 46 cents a yearearlier. The company has indicated that price erosion broughton by intense competition is depressing its business.   Meanwhile, Amgen posted a first-quarter loss of $48.4million, or $1.13 a share, after taking a pretax charge of$129 million related to its dispute with Johnson andamp; Johnsonover the marketing of Erythropoietin, or EPO.   Excluding the charge, though, Amgen had net of 83 cents ashare, higher than the 29 cents it earned last year and abovethe 74 cent-a-share mean estimate of analysts, according toFirst Call.   Len Hefter, managing director of Jefferies andamp; Co.'s OTCdesk in Dallas, said that in addition to earnings news, OTCmarket investors are reacting to positive comments on theU.S. economy and on interest rates by Federal Reserve Boardofficials.   Earlier this week Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspanhad confident words about the economy in testimony beforeCongress. Yesterday, two Federal Reserve Board governorsexpressed optimism that inflation is under control, whichsuggests that rates won't be pushed higher.   While Mr. Hefter said investors seem to be poised to pushstock prices higher, he said, &quot;it's still difficult to get atrend.&quot; Before the OTC market reaches its recent highs,&quot;there is still going to be some resistance,&quot; he said.   MCI Communications, whose secondquarter profit slid to 50cents from 67 cents, wasn't the only stock marked downfollowing disappointing earnings news. Such news sent sharesof several corporations plunging.   ADC Telecommunications slumped 8 5/8, or 22%, to 30 1/8.The telecommunications equipment maker said its earnings forthe third quarter, ending July 31, will fall short of the 44cents a share that it earned a year ago. The company cited aslowdown in its markets and fewer orders from the DefenseDepartment.   SynOptics Communications lost 5, to 26 3/4, after postinglower-than-expected net of 41 cents a share for the secondquarter. Analysts had expected it to earn 48 cents; last yearit earned 34 cents.   Healthsource dropped 3 7/8, or 16%, to 19 3/4 after thehealth maintenance organization operator projectedsecond-quarter earnings of between 34 cents and 38 cents ashare, on a fully diluted basis. Last year, its net totaled34 cents a share, fully diluted. The company blamed the flatresults on litigation-related expenses and on higher medicalcosts.   The news was better for another technology concern. BMCSoftware gained 3 1/4 to 42 3/4 after posting net income of36 cents a share for its first quarter, ended June 30, upfrom 22 cents last year and above analysts' estimates of 33cents.   Elsewhere, VideoCart jumped 3 to 11 1/8 after entering anengineering and manufacturing alliance with InternationalBusiness Machines.

Advanta Corp. added 3/4 to 21 after Prudential SecuritiesInc. analyst Lawrence Eckenfelder repeated a &quot;buy&quot;recommendation on the stock.
