Thisgrowth was encouraged by residents and political leaders, inthe firm belief that it would bring about a higher quality oflife. Economic growth would, it was hoped, so boost thecounty's tax base that government could cut the tax rate andstill collect greater and greater revenues to pay for betterschools, public services and roads.   Instead, despite the years of growth, local property taxrates have steadily increased. To understand why, DalipBammi, director of the county's regional planning commission,conducted a study this spring. The study's results suggest acausal relationship between new development and increases inlocal property tax levies. Nonresidential development hadmore than three times the impact of residential development.This finding, if true, challenges fundamental beliefs, heldby local government officials across the country, about thevalue of development. Development, especially commercial andindustrial development, places burdens on publicinfrastructure and services that are not repaid by theincreased value of the land.</LP><TEXT>   The study examined local taxation from 1986 through 1989,three years of steep tax rate hikes and employment growth.The fact that both tax rates and employment jumped at thesame time is startling -- the relationship was exactly theopposite of what county officials and most social scientistswould have expected. The principal explanation offered by thestudy for this paradox is that the new residents attracted byjob growth demanded not only more services, but better -- andthus more expensive -- services. For instance, as more andmore educated people were drawn to DuPage County by itsperceived quality of life, they demanded higher qualityeducation for their children -- which means attractinghigh-quality teachers, at higher salaries. And becauseurbanization raised the cost of living in DuPage, teachersalaries had to rise again to keep pace. Teacher salaries inDuPage are now among the highest in the region.   By placing so much emphasis on the cost of services,however, the DuPage study may have missed the most importantreason that the cost of government has increased faster thanthe county's resources. Many of the enterprises springing upin places like DuPage are &quot;post-industrial&quot; -- the backoffices of financial services firms or depots for theshipping and consolidation of manufactured goods. Unlike thefactories of the past, these enterprises may not add enoughvalue to the land they occupy to offset the burden they placeon public capital. This is particularly true of retaildevelopment -- malls and shopping centers -- which requirenew roads and more costly maintenance of existing roads.   Because post-industrial operations do not need toconcentrate in any one specific place -- as factories neededto be situated on a rail line -- they can seek cheap land onthe periphery of the community, which requires the county tobuild expensive infrastructure to reach out to thoselow-density areas. In the past, much of the cost of newdevelopment -- particularly the cost of roads and highways --was subsidized by the federal government. The end ofrevenue-sharing has shifted these costs back from the nationat large to local citizens.   Curiously, the belief that development is lucrative may beone of the reasons it isn't: As cities and counties competefor development, they are tempted to subsidize it eitherthrough tax abatements or through publicly financed capitalspending. Industry has been able to pay fewer and fewer ofthe costs it imposes -- the difference is made up by thepublic.   Interestingly, the DuPage study did not call for furtherincreases in property taxes or even taxes on new developmentsto offset their costs. But a reading of the study doessuggest that an unequal local tax system has evolved, bywhich -- through abatements and direct subsidies -- theburden imposed by new development is being paid not be thebeneficiary of the development but by local landowners. Iratelocal taxpayers would do well to focus on equality oftaxation as much as on the amount of taxation.   Across the country, developers have been able to thwartgrowth management movements by arguing that development isthe only way to check rises in property taxes. If theassociation between taxation and development suggested by theDuPage study is confirmed, a powerful new argument formanaging growth may be emerging.   ---   Mr. Bergman is editor of Public Investment News, aquarterly published by the American Planning Association inChicago.</TEXT></DOC>
