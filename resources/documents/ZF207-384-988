Yeh, president of Syscorp International.andM;The product has been designed for developing and prototypingtransaction-based, end-user systems, company officials said.andP;  CommonMicroStep application areas include accounting and inventory control.andM;&quot;We have thousands of hours of development backlog,&quot; Fernandez said.andP;  &quot;Due tobudget constraints and the high demand for software development, we aretasked with finding cost-efficient ways to alleviate our software burden.andP;  Werealized we needed automated tools,&quot; he said.andM;Having heard about MicroStep at a software conference, Fernandez suggestedthat the Air Force purchase the product.andP;  In March, Kelly Air Force Basebought the product and sent five programmers to Austin for training, he said.andM;While the base has only five programmers trained to use the product, theyalready have applied it to at least two projects, Fernandez said.andP;  &quot;MicroStephas several uses in the data processing area.andP;  We are currenlty applying itto a system which does computation to figure out when a person retires, howmuch they'll get in benefits.&quot;andP;  The system is transaction-driven and mustcall up a number of tables, he said.andM;MicroStep runs on any IBM PC AT or compatible computer.andP;  It requires 640K RAMand a Microsoft or compatible mouse.andP;  At Kelly, the product is loaded onto aZenith Data systems Z-248 80286 computer, Fernandez said.andM;In addition to the benefits computation system, developers at the baserecently converted a system developed in Ashton-Tate Corp.'s dBASE III toMicroStep.andP;  The system, which took nine weeks to develop in dBASE III, tookonly four days to develop in MicroStep, said Marisa Valencia, an informationsystems management specialist at Kelly.andM;The system, running in Kelly's technical computer center, tracks the base'shardware and software purchases, Valencia said.andP;  The application lets thebase &quot;keep a current database to go in and look at descriptions andevaluations of products, and also at the top 10 vendors who we're buyingfrom,&quot; Valencia said.andM;The system consists of three main databases and three main menu screens.andO;Both the databases and the main menu screens correspond to the variousvendors, the products and product descriptions, Valencia said.andM;The system enables the base to keep track of its purchases and manage itsinventory and future purchasing plans, she said.andP;  Via the menu screens, userscan add to, delete from or update the system and print reports for vendors,products and their descriptions, she said.andM;MicroStep's shorter development cycle enables users to produce moreapplications in a shorter period.andP;  &quot;We wanted to get the most return for theleast amount of money,&quot; Fernandez said of the $5,000 product.andP;  &quot;This productand other CASE tools can lead to considerable savings to the government,&quot; hesaid.andM;In addition, MicroStep allows end users to get involved in system designearlier than in more traditional software development methods.andM;&quot;MicroStep provides you the flexibility of showing the user the screen andreports almost immediately, and gets the user involved on the front end,&quot;Fernandez said.andM;One of the product's key attractions is &quot;you don't write lines of code,&quot;Fernandez said.andP;  &quot;Once you specify your design and name your fields, all youdo is drag the information from the passive screen to the active one and youhave an executable program.&quot;andM;Over time, MicroStep also makes software reuse practical, as existingspecification elements can be retrieved, modified and reused in subsequentapplicationsandM;Kelly Air Force Base is evaluating 52 defferent CASE tools, but is tronglyconsidering &quot;the cost, payback of the tool and whether is covers the wholelife cycle,&quot;  Fernandez said.andP;  &quot;We have the first of what we hope will bemany CASE tools.andP;  CASE is here to stay,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
