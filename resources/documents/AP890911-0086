East Germany angrily denounced the exodus and accused Hungary of``smuggling'' human beings.   Hungary opened its border to the West at midnight to the EastGermans. The decision came despite Hungary's concerns that thenation could become a conduit for tens of thousands of otherrefugees from Soviet bloc nations.   In Yugoslavia, meanwhile, about 100 Romanians who have fled fromtheir Communist country gathered today at a U.N. office in Belgrade,applying to be resettled in the West.   Bavarian border police said more than 2,000 East German refugees_ mostly young couples or families with young children _ had arrivedfrom Hungary through Austria by midmorning, with hundreds morestreaming in later in the day. The total reportedly could top 10,000.   Austrian border officials said more than 5,700 refugees hadcrossed the border into Austria by midafternoon. In Budapest,officials of the West German charity running the refugee camps saidthe last bus carrying the remnants of the about 7,000 registered atthe Hungarian camps left this afternoon.   West Germany's ZDF television network said the total numberexpected to reach the West in the current exodus could be ``wellover 10,000.''   A 40-year-old Leipzig man, who would not give his name, said: ``Idecided on escaping 27 years ago, and today it worked. It's afeeling that's just tops, just wild.''   The emigration came despite efforts by die-hard Communists inEast Berlin to dissuade Hungary's reform-minded leaders.   As it took place, a West German newspaper and television networktoday reported the condition of East German leader Erich Honecker,who underwent gall bladder surgery last month, has deterioratedbadly. Government officials in Bonn declined comment.   Hungarian radio compared the East Germans' noisy departure bycar, bus and train to a New Year's Eve celebration ``with hornsblaring and people shouting.''   Thousands of East Germans had flooded into Hungary on touristvisas after it tore down its border fence with Austria in May.   East Germany accused Hungary of interfering in its internalaffairs by allowing the mass flight and becoming the first East blocgovernment to help citizens of an ally freely leave their homeland.   The state-run news agency ADN said Hungary, under the guise ofhumanitarianism, ``has engaged in the organized smuggling of humanbeings.''   There have been news reports that the East German government wasplanning to curb travel to Hungary, but the East Berlin leadershiphas denied it intends to impose such restrictions.   But while Hungary risked worsened relations with an East blocally, it could develop closer and potentially lucrative ties withCommon Market member West Germany.   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whosecountry offers East Germans automatic citizenship and help gettingsettled, hailed Hungary's move as representative of ``its humanepolicies.''   An estimated 60,000 East Germans were in Hungary on Sunday andthe Hungarian foreign minister, Gyula Horn, suggested that many morethan the 6,500 formally registered as wanting to leave might crossinto Austria.   Even as the first convoys of refugees made their way intoAustria, new East German arrivals were reported at several refugeecamps in Hungary.   In Bavaria, the refugees lined up to register with charities andborder authorities. As parents stretched, filled out forms or cuppedhands around containers of coffee handed out by volunteers, childrenlined up in the morning mist for teddy bears, picture books andother donated playthings.   West German Red Cross workers had braced for the onslaught byhastily erecting tent communities in several Bavarian towns lastmonth. But most of those arriving early today opted to drive on torelatives in cities as far away as Hamburg.   For many of the thousands who began crossing into Austria shortlyafter midnight, leaving Hungary was occasion for tumultuouscelebration.   Lines of cars, horns honking, formed on the Hungarian side, withsome passengers waving champagne bottles out of car windows. Onarrival in Nickelsdorf, an Austrian border town, dozens jumped fromtheir cars to dance in the street, cheered on by a growing crowd ofAustrians.   While the crossing into West Germany was more subdued for most,some of the East Germans again were overtaken by emotion.   A man from Thueringen, accompanied by his wife and their3-year-old son, told reporters of the joy he and his countrymenexperienced when told Sunday night that they could leave for theWest.   ``My wife and I bawled, and the little one laughed,'' he said,chuckling.   ``This is great!'' shouted Udo, a 26-year old from Dresden, oneof a group of four East Germans in their 20s who shared a car forthe freedom convoy.   ``We applied to leave three years ago, and we got rejected amonth ago,'' he said, explaining his decision to flee throughHungary.   For those without cars, the Austrian Federal Railways had readied90 rail cars capable of carrying 8,000 people, West German railofficials said.   West Germany moved an additional 40 railway cars to severalborder points, while Austrian transport officials had more than 50buses ready.   The fate of the refugees had been discussed for weeks by East andWest Germany, but Hungary said without elaboration that the talkshad failed.   ``The Hungarian government has chosen to illegally allow EastGerman citizens to travel to West Germany in violation ofinternational treaty,'' ADN charged Sunday night.   Hungary decided to suspend a 1969 agreement with East Germanythat says Hungary should not take into account West Germany's claimto East Germans, said Horn.   Horn said Hungary decided to act unilaterally after East Germanyrejected its calls to treat emigration applications by thosereturning home favorably.   About 6,000 East Germans had already fled to the West this summerthrough Hungary, which with Poland is gradually liberalizing whileneighbor East bloc governments resist the more freer climate underMikhail S. Gorbachev, clinging to authoritarian ways.   Several hundred East Germans, seeking safe passage to the West,are now holed up in West Germany's embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.</TEXT></DOC>
