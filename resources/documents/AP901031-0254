Thehange, one of the world's key markets for petroleum, saidit would raise the amount of cash that must be put up by people whobuy and sell contracts for future delivery of crude oil, heatingoil and unleaded gasoline.   Players in the market will have to put up two to three times asmuch money as they did before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent oilprices skyrocketing.   ``Basically, what that does is it takes a certain percentage ofspeculators out of the market,'' said Thomas Blakeslee, an energyanalyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J. ``Thehigher the margin, the more costly it is for a speculator to beinvolved.''   The move came just before a Senate Governmental AffairsCommittee hearing Thursday that will explore oil trading on theMercantile Exchange. The hearing was organized by Sen. Joseph I.Lieberman, D-Conn., who has called oil traders ``speculatorsharks'' and urged that they be required to put up more money.   Mercantile Exchange President R. Patrick Thompson said Wednesdayevening that the exchange's move has nothing to do with Lieberman'sinquiry and is not intended to drive away speculators. Thompsonsaid there is little speculation taking place on the futuresmarket, with minimal effect on oil prices.   He cited an exchange study, also released Wednesday, thatindicates more than 90 percent of trading on the exchange is doneby participants in the oil industry, who conceivably have oilproduction or oil purchases that can be ``hedged'' against pricefluctuations by futures trading.   Thompson said the exchange was raising its margins in order toensure participants will be able to pay cash to meet theirobligations, and that the higher margins were needed because ofincreased volatility in recent days.   ``In order to protect the financial integrity of the contracts,it's appropriate to raise margins,'' Thompson said in a telephoneinterview.   Lieberman did not accept everything the exchange had to say.   ``The timing is too coincidental for me not to feel somesatisfaction that we've influenced them,'' the senator said fromWashington. ``It does confirm the fears that I've expressed overthe last month or more that there was an irresistible temptation toparticipate in a market which was rising as fast as the oil futuresmarket has been, when you could become a player with so littlemoney on the table.''   The exchange's higher margins will take place in two steps afterthe trading sessions on Friday and Tuesday. After the end of thetrading day Tuesday, customers who buy a contract for 1,000 barrelsof crude oil for next month delivery will have to put up $12,000,or $14,000 during the last six days in which that contract istraded.   At current oil prices, that means a player would have to put upa little less than a third of the contact's value.   ``It remains to be seen whether that's adequate,'' Liebermansaid.   The senator also questioned the Mercantile Exchange's method ofdetermining how much oil speculation is taking place.   The exchange's numbers consider a market participant to be anon-speculator if he or she is connected with the oil industry. Theonly oil deals that are taken into account are those that are left``open'' overnight, which would exclude any trades made by peoplewho get in and out of the market in the same day.   ``A lot of those that I would consider speculators are closingtheir interest by the end of the day and are therefore not beingcounted,'' Lieberman said. ``My concern is that the numbers asthey've given them to me underestimate the amount of speculation.''   Thompson was to appear at Lieberman's hearing to present theMercantile Exchange's side. Another of Lieberman's witnesses, aformer stockbroker who now works as a financial consultant, plannedto paint a darker view of the oil trading industry.   Oil futures prices can be manipulated by traders spreadingrumors, and the eventual effects can be devastating to the economy,the witness, Rande Leonard of Phoenix, said in a telephoneinterview Wednesday.   ``The implications are too great to have some jokers messingaround, just jacking up this commodity,'' he said. ``If they wantto do this to something, let them do it in pork bellies, orangejuice, cocoa.''</TEXT></DOC>
