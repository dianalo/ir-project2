But First RepublicBank Corp., the state's largest bank-holding company, has been waging a determined struggle to remain independent in the face of daunting odds.    Those odds got longer last week, when the bank projected a record fourth-quarter loss of as much as $350 million, which would bring its 1987 loss to as much as $659 million, and omitted its 25-cent quarterly dividend on common stock. And with some analysts predicting that 1988 losses could reach $100 million, the bank has begun to hear the voices of doom. &quot;It is difficult to envision a scenario with independent entities in Texas,&quot; says James J. McDermott Jr., an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., a New York investment-banking and research concern that specializes in bank stocks.    To silence the doubters, First Republic is scrambling to shore up its shaky capital base or shed some of its troubled -- and unwanted -- assets, which include a motel, shopping centers and office buildings. &quot;We are going down every track we can go down,&quot; says Joseph R. Musolino, a First Republic vice chairman, who has attacked the bank's biggest problem -- its deteriorating real-estate-loan portfolio. The company is also beefing up a separate special-credits operation, a kind of SWAT team of problem-loan specialists, and turning them loose on sour business and energy loans.    Like most of its peers, First Republic has been deeply wounded by Texas's double whammy of low energy prices and deteriorating real-estate values. But most of those peers have sought -- or been forced into -- much different recovery strategies. Houston's Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. was sold last May to Chemical New York Corp., Texas's first major interstate-banking combination. Los Angeles's First Interstate Bancorp is buying Allied Bancshares Inc., Houston; and First City Bancorp. of Texas, Houston, is in the midst of a federally assisted bailout.    Some banking experts have urged First Republic to pursue an out-of-state merger partner, which could provide capital and a much-needed diversification of the bank's real-estate-laden loan portfolio. About 40% of its loans are in real-estate projects, including home mortages, and 57% of those are in the state's most depressed markets -- Fort Worth, Dallas and Austin.    Even if First Republic were to put itself on the block, buyers for troubled Texas banks haven't been lining up. &quot;There are no buyers,&quot; Gerald Fronterhouse, First Republic's chairman, president and chief executive officer, says in an interview.    First Republic remains convinced that it can survive as an independent entity by aggressively managing the loan portfolio and by wringing additional cost savings out of the takeover, completed in June, of InterFirst Corp., a shaky Dallas rival.    But critics wonder whether this will be enough in a state that doesn't have to wait to see what a recession would bring. &quot;They have yet to come to grips with the possibility that they might not survive, and that bothers me,&quot; says Charles W. Peabody, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst who interviewed First Republic's management team last week. Unless they do, he adds, they &quot;can't take the right actions.&quot;    The bank's critics also have carped about its preoccupation with absorbing InterFirst. One reason for the anticipated fourth-quarter deficit, they point out, is that some real-estate loans lacked current appraisals, a sign that internal controls may have slipped.    Mr. Peabody, and others, would like to see the bank pursue added capital and dispose of troubled loans more aggressively. First Republic, however, insists that it isn't in any danger. &quot;It's a long ball game and we're through a quarter here,&quot; Mr. Fronterhouse says. &quot;You just have to take a longer view.&quot;    Mr. Fronterhouse insists that the operating efficiencies derived from the InterFirst takeover are generating net savings of about $140 million annually, including some accounting adjustments, resulting in &quot;underlying earnings&quot; before bad-loan provisions and asset write-downs. Further, First Republic's third-quarter ratio of total overhead costs, including pay and benefits, is one of the industry's best -- 69 cents for every $100 in assets, or $2.76 on an annual basis. When the Texas economy recovers, he predicts, &quot;this is a real money machine.&quot;    Unfortunately, Mr. Fronterhouse's confidence isn't echoed outside the bank. Since last week's announcement of wider-than-expected losses and the dividend omission, the company's stock has plunged to $4 at yesterday's close from about $6.75 last Thursday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares traded as high as $26.25 last summer.    Further, industry analysts estimate that the company needs between $150 million and $200 million in fresh capital to lift its ratio of equity to assets -- a measure of its ability to absorb losses -- above the 4% level that generally keeps nervous bank regulators at bay. By year's end, the bank will have more than $1.1 billion in shareholders' equity, a slim 3.5% of its assets -- and that counts preferred stock, which is excluded by some analysts. &quot;There is clearly a race in progress between deterioration in the loan portfolio and the residual capital base,&quot; warns Keefe Bruyette's Mr. McDermott.    Mr. Fronterhouse insists that the bank isn't under any pressure from regulators to boost capital. Besides, he points out, the market for the securities of troubled Texas banks has pretty much dried up, leaving internal improvements as the primary road to balance-sheet improvements.    The company probably used up whatever market cachet it had left last spring, when it raised $200 million as part of its $544 million InterFirst takeover. First Republic already pays high yields of as much as 17% on some existing preferred, and investors are gun-shy after watching others take major hits in federal bank bailouts, in line with the recent policy of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which arranges rescues of insured banks.    Consider First City Bancorp. of Texas in Houston, where preferred stockholders are being offered about $8.50 a share, though the original terms of their stock call for a liquidation, at First City's option, for $48.50 a share.    Instead, First Republic is exploring several steps to boost capital or unload some costly problem loans and assets, including:    --Selling packages of foreclosed real estate at a deep discount.    --Spinning off assets as asset-backed securities. Earlier, it sold credit-card and auto-loan receivables.    --Attempting again to sell and lease back its downtown Dallas headquarters facility, which drew little interest last year but may now have a buyer.    --Offering existing holders rights to buy a new issue of First Republic shares.    --Selling non-banking businesses.    The bank's lending strategy is to drastically pull back from real-estate loans, reducing the company's portfolio from its 40% share of total loans to between 15% to 20% &quot;just as soon as we can,&quot; Mr. Musolino says. But he acknowledges that it will take time, especially since real estate represents a huge share of its $3.13 billion in nonperforming assets, which was 12.4% of total assets in the third quarter. The bank would like to make more energy loans, but First Republic executives say good deals in the depressed oil patch are scarce now.    Meanwhile, First Republic says its funding is holding up even though Keefe Bruyette gives the bank's certificates of deposit the research concern's second-lowest rating. A recent consumer certificate-of-deposit program that pays an attractive interest-rate bonus has collected about $750 million in 11 weeks, about half of it new money to the bank, First Republic says.    The bank also expects to eliminate 800 to 1,000 jobs, or 5.2% to 6.5% of its work force, next year as it continues to consolidate InterFirst. It already wiped out about 2,100 jobs, mostly through attrition. The cutbacks were planned at the time of the takeover last June, and haven't changed.    Still, the question lingers. Can First Republic go it alone? &quot;We will do what is best for our shareholders,&quot; Mr. Fronterhouse responds. That sounds much less confident than the brave Texas banker talk of only a year ago, he is reminded. Mr. Fronterhouse repeats: &quot;We will do what is best for our shareholders.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
