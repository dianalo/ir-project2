The government is expected to release a consultation papershortly so that the public can weigh the merits of such aplan. Officials say they remain neutral on the matter, but anearlier draft of the paper indicated that the governmentfavored some form of depositors' protection, according tobankers who have read it.</LP><TEXT>   The debate on deposit insurance heated up during and afterthe banking crisis of 1983-86, when seven local banks on thebrink of collapse were taken over by the government or otherbanks. At the time, the public clamored for adeposit-insurance plan but met stiff resistance from biglocal banks. The issue also drew little attention from thegovernment; regulators focused instead on such matters astightening banking supervision and capital-adequacy ratios inthe wake of the crisis.   Events of last year apparently prompted a shift in thegovernment's attitude. On July 8, Hong Kong regulators closedthe Bank of Credit andamp; Commerce Hong Kong Ltd., following thelead of regulators in Europe to clamp down on scandal-riddenBCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A., the bank's parent. The localclosure prompted a public outcry from angry depositors andsparked miniruns on several of the biggest and soundest banksin the colony.   The serious attention the government is giving to depositinsurance should silence critics who have long accused it ofprotecting the interests of big banks. Among the staunchestopponents of deposit insurance is the Hongkong andamp; ShanghaiBanking Corp., which argues that deposit insurance would dolittle to further the government's objective of stabilizingthe banking system. Instead, it would likely saddle big bankswith the hefty costs of implementing such a plan, HongkongBank officials say.   &quot;Deposits in Hong Kong are concentrated in so few banksthat such a scheme, if implemented, would be grossly unfairto these banks,&quot; says Vincent Cheng, senior manager ofHongkong Bank's research division, and a member of theLegislative Council, the colony's lawmaking body. &quot;Iteffectively means that big banks would be subsidizing weakbanks.&quot;   Even bankers who say they are openminded on the matterstill express reservations on how effective adeposit-insurance plan would be in stemming bank runs. J.P.Lee, an executive director of Hongkong Chinese Bank, says,&quot;The critical issue is how much coverage the scheme wouldoffer, what are the costs of the exercise and whether suchcosts would outweigh benefits.&quot; Hongkong Chinese Bank iscontrolled by Lippo Group of Indonesia, which reached atentative pact late last year to take over BCC Hong Kong.   Supporters of deposit insurance, among them manygovernment officials, believe that the miniruns last yearproduced strong evidence that the banking system leaves a lotto be desired. Prior to BCC Hong Kong's closure, nodepositors had lost a cent of savings because of bankfailures. The prospect that 40,000 BCC Hong Kong depositorsmight lose their money spread panic. (Under the takeoveragreement, the new buyer has promised BCC Hong Kongdepositors that they can withdraw all or most of theirsavings in the future.)   But skeptics of deposit insurance cite the same incidentto underscore the limitations of such protection. Rumorsspread quickly in this densely packed community, and somebankers argue that the public's tendency to join a lineoutweighs any desire to find out why the line is there.Anthony Nicolle, who stepped down last year as head of theBanking Commission to become general manager of StandardChartered Bank's Hong Kong and China area, says, &quot;If that'sthe way minds work here, there are serious reservations&quot;about whether deposit insurance would be effective. But headds that, on balance, he is &quot;ambivalent&quot; about the scheme.   The cost of a deposit-insurance plan could be hefty,depending on the size of the insurance fund. The bigger thefund, the greater the coverage for depositors. According tobankers who have read an earlier draft of the consultationpaper, the government is suggesting a fund that could copewith the failure of a medium-sized bank. That proposalrecognizes the impracticality of establishing a fund largeenough to meet depositor demands if a major bank collapses.   Having decided the size of the insurance fund, thegovernment would next look for ways to finance it. Bankerssay most discussion has focused on a plan under which thefund would guarantee 75% to 100% of deposits under HK$100,000(US$12,888). That scenario also supposes an annual levy ofbetween 0.1% to 0.2% to be imposed on all Hong Kong dollardeposits under HK$100,000 with a local or foreign bank. Thegovernment estimates that HK$1.8 billion to HK$2.5 billionwould be collected each year.   Bankers say the government favors a flat-rate system inwhich a bank's contribution to the insurance fund grows inproportion to the size of its deposits. The alternative, arisk-adjusted system in which banks with riskier assets pay ahigher premium, is more difficult because of problems indevising and implementing it.   Under a flat-rate system, the burden of the program wouldfall on the few big banks, namely Hongkong Bank and itsmajority-controlled Hang Seng Bank, and the Bank of Chinagroup, which control the majority of Hong Kong's deposits.   Bankers' objections to the scheme don't stem from premiumpayments alone, since the costs are widely expected to bepassed to depositors in the form of higher bank charges orlower interest payments. However, big banks are concernedthat the government could face a political liability if ithas to bail out the fund when it lacks sufficient money tosatisfy all depositors. Even the government concedes that itwill take several years for the fund to accumulate enoughmoney to cope with the failure of a medium-sized bank. In theevent of a crisis, says Hongkong Bank's Mr. Cheng, &quot;Thegovernment isn't going to bail out the fund; it will come tous for rescue.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
