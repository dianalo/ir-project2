The bioinsecticide was developed by Crop Genetics InternationalCorp. of Hanover, Md., and is aimed at controlling the European cornborer, a pest estimated to cause more than $400 million damage tothe nation's corn crop, said John Henry, the company's president andchief executive officer.   A first round of tests was conducted in Maryland this year andCrop Genetics plans to ask the federal Environmental ProtectionAgency next week for approval to conduct tests in 1989, he said.   Testing will be done on 12 acres of land, Henry said.   EPA approval, which could take up to three months, is necessaryeach time a test is planned, said Albert Heier, an EPA spokesman inWashington.   In addition to fighting the European corn borer, thebioinsecticide also works against the Southwestern corn borer, Henrysaid.   DeKalb-Pfizer Genetics, a division of DeKalb Genetics Corp. inDeKalb, Ill. has signed a contract with the Maryland firm to helptest, develop and market the product, said Robert Pritchard, aspokesman for DeKalb-Pfizer.   ``If this product works as well as the folks at Crop Geneticsthink it will, it will be a major breakthrough in crop protectionagainst corn bores,'' Pritchard said.   ``Corn borers are the No. 1 pest in the country's No. 1 crop,''Henry said.   ``They have a laboratory technique to impregnate the seed withthis vaccine and they've done it on a laboratory scale,'' Pritchardsaid. ``We're working to try to develop the technology to do this ona commercial basis.''   DeKalb-Pfizer plans to test the bioinsecticide on land it owns inIlliopolis in central Illinois, Pritchard said.   In addition, Crop Genetics also plans to test the bioinsecticidein Stanton, Minn., in Hooper and Hastings, Neb., and in Inglesideand Beltsville, Md., said James Davis, the company's general counsel.   To make the bioinsecticide, Crop Genetics scientists took a genefrom a single-cell soil bacterium that produces a protein andspliced it into endophytes, microorganisms that live in plants,Henry said. When the borer eats the plant the protein becomes toxicand destroys the insect's stomach.   ``It gives the insects permanent ulcers,'' he said.   The Maryland tests showed the microorganism could not liveoutside the corn plant, did not remain in the crop residue or soiland posed no risk to humans, Henry said.</TEXT></DOC>
