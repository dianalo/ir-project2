Everett Koop says oldpeople don't have to suffer poor health just because they're old.   ``The whole theme of this meeting is it's never too late tostart prevention,'' Koop said Wednesday at the close of a three-dayworkshop on health promotion and aging.   How do older people maximize their health? The same way youngerpeople do, said Koop: don't smoke, don't drink too much, rest, eatright and exercise.   ``Old age is not a disease and there are many oldsters who aredisease free,'' said Koop. ``You don't necessarily have to haveyour kidneys fail, you don't necessarily have to have dementia. ...My plea would be to separate old age and disease. They don'tnecessarily go together.''   Smoking is a prime example of the never-too-late approach, saidKoop.   ``There is a tremendous tendency on the part of physicians tosay, `Well he's over 65, he hasn't got many vices, hasn't got manyyears left, why bother the poor old fellow?''' he said.   ``But if they would just look him straight in the eye and say,`You're not going to live as long or have as good a quality of lifeas if you stop smoking,' if he stops he will note an immediatebenefit.''   Koop, 71, said he is convinced older people will shift tohealthier diets and exercise more if properly counseled by theirdoctors.   ``I do think you can change a person's behavior,'' he said. ``Ifsomebody is willing to look at him from a bird's-eye view and tryto rearrange his life and point out how he could do these thingsand what the benefits would be, people listen and they benefit.''   Even though the U.S. population is aging, he said, it is notbecoming less healthy.   ``As we see people who are now in middle-age come along into thegraying years they are going to be far healthier than thisgeneration was when it entered the 65-and-older group,'' he said.   ``These are the people who are jogging and swimming and hiking.These are the people who are snacking on salad and yogurt. Theseare the people who are wearing sensible shoes. They have stoppedsmoking. They have given up hard liquor. They wear seat belts. Theyunderstand the things they can do to preserve the quality of lifeand the function they already have.''</TEXT></DOC>
