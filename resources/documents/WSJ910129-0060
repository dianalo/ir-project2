Although the action wasn't expected to affect the debtsecurities' prices greatly, it came as an embarrassment to astate that formerly boasted the nation's strongest regionaleconomy. California has been buffeted in recent months byrising unemployment and sharply curtailed job growth. About28 other states are struggling with budget deficits; some ofthose states have seen their securities downgraded, and theothers may find their debt subject to review.</LP><TEXT>   Sandamp;P is considering downgrading California's triple-Arating on $11.6 billion of general obligation bonds. Alsolisted on CreditWatch with negative implications is $3billion of state agency debt, the ratings of which areguaranteed or supported by state appropriations.   Currently, California is one of only nine states ratedtriple-A by Sandamp;P. The others are Maine, Maryland, Missouri,New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah andVirginia.   Sandamp;P said it would likely lower California's debt rating tothe double-A category if the state government fails to takeenough action to reduce the projected deficits for 1991 and1992. Republican Gov. Pete Wilson is working with theDemocrat-controlled Legislature to soften the deficit by, inpart, reducing expenditures. The Legislature has until Juneto act on the governor's spending plan.   The magnitude of California's projected deficit over thenext 18 months, which includes the shortfall for theremainder of 1990-91 and for the year 1991-92, has been setat around $7 billion by the governor's office and $9.9billion by legislative analyst Elizabeth Hill. With spendinggrowing at an annual rate of 11% and revenue growth slowingto 5% a year in a softening economy, Ms. Hill calculated lastfall that the budget gap would amount to about $6 billion. Inher latest revision, however, she said she significantlyunderstated the budgetary problem, which is exacerbated bycontinuing uncertainty over the Mideast war.   Administration officials, embarrassed by the new questionsover the state's credit-worthiness, are trying to emphasizethe positive, asserting that they still maintain theirtriple-A bond rating, not only with Sandamp;P but with Moody'sInvestors Service Inc. The officials also say that theeconomic problems in California are of a temporary, cyclicalnature. Thomas W. Hayes, state director of finance, said thatwhile he disagrees with Sandamp;P's concern about California'sfinancial situation, &quot;we . . . certainly welcome theadditional scrutiny as it will ultimately demonstrateCalifornia's long-term financial strength.&quot;   Sandamp;P officials said that Gov. Wilson's Jan. 10 budgetsubmission would contribute to a budgetary balance for 1992and beyond. But, Sandamp;P said, &quot;The budget for 1992 assumes $1.2billion of revenue based on assumptions considerably moreoptimistic than most forecasts of recovery, at a time whenthe prospects for the national economy is increasinglyuncertain.&quot;   State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, a Democrat, said Gov.Wilson's plan also carried no provision for gettingCalifornia past the current situation. And, she added, &quot;Sandamp;P'saction signals another dark cloud over the state's gloomyfinancial picture.&quot;   Banking economists are generally agreed, however, thatCalifornia is intrinsically healthy and vibrant enough torebound from its current downturn. Though the 7.1%unemployment rate for December exceeds the national rate of6.1%, they say, it still pales by comparison to thedouble-digit unemployment experienced during the 1982recession. And while the state experienced a net decrease of175,000 jobs in 1982, 1990 saw an increase of 350,000 newjobs and 1991 should see the creation of an additional100,000, said Joseph A. Wahed, chief economist at Wells FargoBank.   Some bond traders say the state's budget woes haven'tmaterially hurt prices of California securities, so far. Theysaid a downgrade would put pressure on prices, although thestate's relatively strong finances compared with many otherstates would prevent a major decline.   &quot;We have not seen that much of a differential. I am sureif it does get a downgrade, you will see some change, butCalifornia trades better than the rest of the market,&quot; saidJoe Olson, senior vice president for municipal bond tradingat Sutro andamp; Co., San Francisco. He indicated that the realtest for California may come later next month, when the statehas slated an estimated $1 billion to $1.3 billion offering.   ---   Constance Mitchell in New York contributed to thisarticle.</TEXT></DOC>
