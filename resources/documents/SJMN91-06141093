There's no reason to assume thatbuilding out the airport as rapidly as possible is the best thing to do.Hemmed in by highways, it can only grow so far. Going slow means lesslikelihood of making mistakes.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DESTINATION: SAN JOSEMODERATE GROWTH, AS HAMMER SUGGESTS, IS THEBEST BET FOR THE AIRPORT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     Mayor Susan Hammer wants study of a noise control ordinance to be an earlypart of the environmental analysis. She'll consider supporting a law beforethe airport master plan is completed, since that could take years. It's a goodpoint, and it may help placate airport neighbors, who oppose growth because ofthe noise.;    But Hammer also advocates lengthening an airport runway now,before the plan is done, so that overseas flights can take off full. AmericanAirlines can't fill its planes to Tokyo or they'd be too heavy to take off onthe short runway. How embarrassing.;    The plan is to extend the longestrunway, not to lengthen a second, shorter one for jumbo jets as earlierproposed. Lengthening the second runway would have dramatically increased theairport's capacity for big planes -- and for noise. Neighbors didn't like it.They may not like Hammer's plan much better, but it's a good one.;    Themayor and staff also want a task force to study that eternal question: Whatthe heck do you do with general aviation? Small planes don't belong at theinternational airport, but nobody else wants them either. The task force'ssolution is bound to be unpopular with someone; it'll be up to Hammer to makeit work.;    Moderate growth at the international airport is a likelycompromise. The maximum build-out would bring 21.2 million passengers to SanJose in 2010, three times the current number. Will highways and mass transitbe able to handle that? Maybe, but it doesn't hurt to go a little slow -- aslong as it's not so slow as to harm the city's economy. We're curious to seewhat &quot;moderate&quot; turns out to mean.;    So far Hammer has handled thiscontroversy well. With Councilman David Pandori, she has worked with neighborsand sought compromise. But fortunately, she views the airport as a crucialeconomic asset whose benefits reach far beyond its immediate neighborhood --in fact, far beyond city borders.; FOLLOW-UP . . . A public hearing on how theenvironmental study will be carried out is planned 7:30 p.m. Tuesday at SanJose City Hall, 801 N.
