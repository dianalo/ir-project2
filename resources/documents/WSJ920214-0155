The group is made up of chief executive officers of about200 of the country's largest companies. It spelled out itsrecommendation in its first position paper on executivecompensation, released at the same time that the SEC maderecommendations on executive pay reporting.</LP><TEXT>   The SEC focused on requiring companies to disclose thevalue of stock and stock options in the year they weregranted. Currently, options are treated both for disclosureand accounting purposes as if they have no current value.   The Business Roundtable approach would smooth out thereporting of pay, which would greatly reduce the bigcompensation numbers that are reported when top officersexercise options. Executives argue that a single-year numberoverstates the actual annual compensation received, sinceoptions typically can't be exercised for three to five yearsafter they are received, and often are held much longer.   Such a change, the group believes, would damp the currentprotest over executive pay. &quot;There wouldn't be such abrouhaha if the compensation was recognized over the timeframe in which it was earned,&quot; said a Business Rountablespokesman.   The Roundtable also recommended that bonuses be reportedseparately from salaries, and that tabular data on cashcompensation should be given for multiple years to permityear-to-year comparisons.   The Roundtable also made a suggestion for shareholderswith complaints about executive pay: Tell it to the board.   &quot;Very clear avenues of recourse are available toshareholders who are dissatisfied with the performance oftheir board of directors in matters of executive compensationor share ownership programs,&quot; the big-business group said.   The position tacitly opposes another recent move by theSEC to allow direct shareholder advisory votes oncompensation-related matters. Instead, the paper lays out afive-step process for disgruntled shareholders, beginningwith communicating directly with corporate managers and boardmembers, to withholding votes for board members and mountingan alternative slate of directors.   The paper is important because of the relative scarcity ofopen corporate opinion on the subject of executive pay. Mostexecutives and business groups have been shying away frompublic comment on the issue. In public forums andgovernmental hearings, the corporate side of the argument haslargely been taken by compensation consultants and tradegroups.</TEXT></DOC>
