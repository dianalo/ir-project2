What is &quot;absurd&quot; is not the Italian-American firecaptain posing as an Hispanic, but the ridiculous programsthat force otherwise -- honest, decent people to stoop tosuch deplorable measures. Capt. Peter Roybal's mission shouldbe striving to be the best firefighter in San Francisco --Hispanic, white, black or yellow -- not exposing qualified,hard-working firefighters who for whatever reason chose tocall themselves one ethnic group or another.   As an Hispanic, I am reminded constantly how grateful Iought to be to the liberal plantation for all theaffirmative-action (quota) programs they have forced down ourthroats in order to correct all the injustices that may ormay not have happened to my great-great-grandfather's secondcousin twice removed. Now, as a second-year law student Iwill be forced to endure for the rest of my life that anystatus I may attain will not be due to my hard work, mystaying up till all hours of the night reading dry cases, thetens of thousands of dollars in student loans I have obtained(I've never received any minority-based financial aid) or thefact that I have received unwavering support from family andfriends. No, as there is now, there will always be a questionthat I obtained this status because by some wonderful, divinefluke my last name is Sandoval and I am blessed with ayear-round tan.</LP><TEXT>   I hope my children will not be forced to live with thisblessing.   Frank D. Sandoval Jr.   President   The Federalist Society   Northeastern University   School of Law   Boston   ---   Over my 13-year career as a firefighter I have supervisedand have been supervised by blacks and whites. To my certainknowledge, no one in a fire or other emergency situation hasever cared about the race of those seeking to help them. Whenpeople's lives are at stake, the only thing that shouldmatter is that the personnel operating at the incident are aswell-qualified and well-trained as possible. The best way todetermine qualifications, both for hiring and promotion, isthrough unbiased and objective testing.   The San Francisco situation, with its ethnic scramble togain admittance to one or another favored minority, seems torealize the ultimate absurdity of the whole system that hasgained a hold in this country. Isn't it time to go back tothe idea that people are individuals, who have merit based ontheir character?   William T. Brockman   Atlanta</TEXT></DOC>
