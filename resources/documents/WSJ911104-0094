Such a limited strike would enable the union to putpressure on the company without committing itself to a costlyfull-blown strike for itself and its members. It is unclearhow hard the move will hit Caterpillar, a Peoria, Ill.,construction-equipment maker that is fighting a deeprecession in its markets both in the U.S. and abroad.</LP><TEXT>   The union said 2,000 employees who build motor roadgraders and off-road trucks, among other things, would walkoff their jobs at Caterpillar's facilities in Decatur, Ill.Another 400 members who assemble certain track-type tractorsin East Peoria, Ill., would also strike. The planned strikeincludes 15% of the 16,000 people currently working under theUAW contract at Caterpillar.   Analysts have said Caterpillar could withstand a shortstrike because it has built what one Caterpillar officialcalls &quot;a strike hedge&quot; in the form of construction equipmentand parts. A union spokesman yesterday suggested the companycould run into trouble at the locations targeted, because&quot;much of the equipment is built to order&quot; at the two sites.   As of late yesterday, Caterpillar and union spokesmen saidtop negotiators from the two sides hadn't held a weekendmeeting to discuss their differences. UAW officials basicallywant Caterpillar to agree to a contract similar to one theunion reached last month with Deere andamp; Co., a big Moline,Ill., farm and construction-equipment maker. Caterpillarargues that its talks should be treated separately.   The Caterpillar contract initially was slated to expireSept. 30, but the two sides extended the deadline. The UAWdelayed its talks with Caterpillar in order to complete talkswith Deere. It wanted to use the Deere talks to negotiate a&quot;pattern settlement&quot; for the agricultural, construction andheavy equipment industry.   Last week, the UAW notified Caterpillar it was cancelingthe extension, putting pressure on the company to sweeten itsterms before yesterday's deadline.   The company said it did just that this past Thursday whenit presented the union with a revised contract. TheCaterpillar spokesman said the new proposal provided theaverage union employee about $37.50 per hour in wages andbenefits by the end of a three-year contract, compared withthe $32.35 per hour currently provided.   The union rejected the revised contract proposal &quot;withinfour minutes,&quot; according to both the company and the unionspokesmen. The union spokesman said the revised terms &quot;didn'tcome close&quot; to the Deere contract.&quot;   ---   Robert L. Rose contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
