(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With 900,000 new college graduates inthe job market this year, you`ve got to make it easier for yourfirst full-time employer to find you.   The key elements in your campaign to stand out in the crowd areyour resume, your appearance, and the interview. Placement expertsat Dunhill Personnel System, Inc., a national employment servicesorganization, offer these tips for all three.   Your resume is the first bid for attention, and its purpose isto get you an interview.   Keep it brief, and keep it neat. One page with wide margins isbest, but don't let it run any more than two. Use plain bond paper,cleanly typed. Re-read it to catch typing, spelling or grammaticalerrors, then have someone else read it to backstop you.   Summarize your track record. If you've worked before _ even in asummer job _ describe what you did, including special contributionssuch as saving the company time or money. Include volunteer work.Use active verbs; tell what you did, not what you were. Highlightyour accomplishments, experiences and academic achievements. Makesure the resume prominently displays your name, address and phonenumber. Omit any other information.   Your resume has done its job, and now you must prepare for yourinterview. Your interviewer's first impression will be thestrongest, and it will be based on your appearance. So groom anddress carefully and appropriately for business.   If you're a man, choose a well-fitted dark gray or navy businesssuit and a crisp white long-sleeved dress shirt, with eitherstraight or button-down collar. Pick a traditional stripe, foulardor paisley tie, and wear well-shined black shoes with plain darksocks.   If you're a woman, wear a skirt suit or a dress with a jacket,and conservative jewelry. Choose fleshtone or neutral hosieryshades for pump or mocassin dress shoes with low or medium heels.   Avoid vivid colors or patterns, trendy or daring styles, andscents of any kind _ aftershave, cologne or perfume. Grooming andmakeup should be neat and understated.   Treat the interview the same way you would an examination atschool _ learn what you can about the company and the industry, andanticipate what questions you may be asked. Be ready with relevantfacts about yourself, such as the strengths that will be assets tothe company and any background or interests that may relate to theposition.   Arrive a few minutes before your appointment, allowing time tocarefully fill out any application that may be required. Greet yourinterviewer cordially , maintaining eye contact. Be cooperative,poised and friendly during the interview, and let the interviewerlead the discussion. Don`t ask about salary, vacations, and otherbenefits early in the talk. Don't make derogatory or negativecomments about past employers.   When the meeting concludes, thank the interviewer, expressinginterest in the position (or not, as the case may be). Follow upwith a personal note in the same vein, written soon after theappointment.</TEXT></DOC>
