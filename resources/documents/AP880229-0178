(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Only three applicants for concealedweapon permits under Florida's new gun law have been turned downbecause of previous crimes, but officials said Monday manyconvictions don't show up because of loopholes.   As of Thursday, 20,393 Floridians had received concealed weaponspermits under the law effective Oct. 1, state records show. A totalof 26,086 applications have been received, and of those only 20have been denied, said Marilyn Thompson, chief of the Bureau ofConcealed Weapons.   Thirteen were rejected because of documentation problems, fourfor other reasons and three because of a criminal history, Ms.Thompson said.   Under certain circumstances, the state cannot deny permits toadmitted felons, people with a history of violent crimes and thosewith drinking and psychological problems, said Ms. Thompson.   Unless a judge formally hands down a guilty verdict, a defendantwho pleads guilty or no contest to either a felony or a misdemeanorhas not been formally convicted, she said. Such withholding ofadjudication, which does not create a criminal record, is usuallypart of a plea bargain on first offenses or lesser offenses andoften is accompanied by probation.   ``I can only deny a permit under the law if they have beenformally convicted of a felony by a judge,'' Ms. Thompson said.   Unadjudicated cases are not entered into the Florida Departmentof Law Enforcement computer system, which the bureau uses to checkcriminal backgrounds.   ``No adjudication means there is no guilt,'' Marion Hammer, alobbyist for Unified Sportsmen of Florida, a group backed by theNational Rifle Association. ``And if there is no guilt, you can'ttake a person's rights away _ whether that's the right to vote orthe right to bear arms.   Stewart Schurr of the FDLE said he doubted that unadjudicateddefendants receiving concealed weapon permits would lead to amurder increase.   ``The sort of people who do these crimes don't go get a permitso that they can conceal the gun and sneak up on someone,'' hesaid. ``In other words, I wouldn't be comfortable saying the lawhas had any kind of effect.''   But some people, including tourism officials, fear Florida coulddevelop a ``Wild West'' image.   ``Here in Canada, anything to do with Florida makes front page _especially bad news,'' said Ellis Webber, the Florida TourismDepartment's marketing director for Canada, which ships theSunshine State 1.5 million tourists yearly.   Before lawmakers closed a legal loophole allowing open carryingof firearms, ``We got telephone calls from people concerned aboutgoing to Florida and seeing people strolling down the shopping mallwith guns on their hips,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
