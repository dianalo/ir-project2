Levin, author of The Computer Virus Handbook(Osborne/McGraw-Hill, 1990).andP;  &quot;You can't cut all telecommunications links orban software brought from home,&quot; he insists.andP;  &quot;You might as well try toforbid gossiping at the office.&quot;andM;Instead, Levin recommends a few intelligent policies.andP;  &quot;Go ahead and downloada program from a bulletin board; just don't run it,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Scan thecode, and if a program looks good, contact the author and ask for a cleancopy.&quot;andM;Crime and punishment.andP;  Enforcing security policies is another common concernamong micro managers.andP;  Networks tend to make enforcement easier by virtue oftheir centralization.andP;  But standalong PCs present a more challenging problem.andO;Here, education and organized campaigns to increase user awareness are themain tools of micro managers.andP;  &quot;But you have to do it right,&quot; says Du Pont'sCuccia.andP;  &quot;You don't want to give users the impression that Big Brother iswatching.&quot;andM;Like many managers, Cuccia is as concerned about information security as heis about viruses.andP;  &quot;People often keep sensitive files and documents on theircomputers,&quot; he sys.andP;  &quot;It doesn't occur to them that this can be nearly as badas leaving a document right on the desk.&quot;andM;Johnson andamp; Johnson's Murray agrees: &quot;We have a secure mainframe, but whathappens if someone downloads a sensitive file to a PC, works on it for awhile, and then goes to lunch?&quot; he asks.andP;  &quot;Any passerby could walk away withformulas, payroll information, and other sensitive data.&quot;andM;In addition to installing software that requires users to enter IDs andpasswords, Johnson andamp; Johnson is working to incorporate security awarenessinto employee orientation.andP;  For example, a new manual outlines securityguidelines and procedures.andP;  Most of them, says Murray, are simple and fairlyobvious: Never leave a terminal unattended, put write-protect tabs on yourmaster disks, don't use your birth date or spouse's name as a password, andbe alert for computer viruses.andM;Of course sometimes &quot;virus awareness&quot; gets a bit out of hand.andP;  Several micromanagers report receiving virus alerts from users with very ordinary hardwareor software problems.andP;  &quot;Anytime something goes wrong, it gets blamed on avirus,&quot; says one manager.andP;  &quot;I guess that means we're doing our job.&quot;andM;DATA SECURITY;andM;A FEDERAL FEUDandM;A federal standard for computer security was expected by early fall from theNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of theCommerce Department.andP;  NIST planned to propose a system known as public-keycryptography for ensuring the integrity of documents sent over computernetworks.andM;However, the NIST project has been &quot;temporarily shelved,&quot; according toShirley Radack, NIST's group leader for program coordination and support,because of opposition from the National Security Agency (NSA).andM;Beyond citing &quot;national security issues,&quot; neither organization will say whythe NSA objects to the proposed computer-security standard.andP;  From Radack'sperspective, providing a defense against computer snoops and vandals is oneway to further the government's aim of &quot;encouraging as much work as possibleto take place on networks.&quot;andP;  Of course, a public-key cryptography systemwould also prevent intrusions by the NSA.andM;DON'T SHOOTandM;THE MESSENGERandM;1-2-3, Microsoft Word, and Microsoft Works are among the programs mostfrequently--and incorrectly--blamed for infecting a system with a virus,according to John McAfee, founder of the Computer Virus Industry Associationand author of Scan, an antivirus shareware program available from McAfeeAssociates (Santa Clara, Calif., 408-988-3832).andM;The reason is that most viruses do their insidious work by finding anapplication's executable (EXE) file, determining how long it is, andattaching themselves to its end.andP;  What 1-2-3, Word, and Works have in commonis that in order to minimize the amount of memory required for programexecution, they don't ask DOS to load the entire EXE file at once.andP;  Instead,they instruct DOS to load just a startup portion, or kernel.andP;  The kernel thenloads the rest of the file, using a DOS extender (in 1-2-3) or overlays (inWord and Works).andP;  Viruses don't know that, however, so they end up attachingthemselves to the end of the kernel rather than to the end of the EXE file.andM;This causes immediate program failure and makes it look as if 1-2-3, Word, orWorks transmitted the virus, when in fact, a system could have been infectedfor some time.andP;  1-2-3, Word, and Works simply force the virus into the open.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
