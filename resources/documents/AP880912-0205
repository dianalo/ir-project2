(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the cold pre-dawn light of theRockies, a dozen executives of the Champion Spark Plug Co. shiverinto jogging gear.   They wheeze through a 20-minute run on a winding pine-foresttrail, reluctantly plunge half-naked into a rushing mountainstream, and then head off to climb some rocks.   It's all in a day's work at the Colorado Outward Bound School,where hard-charging managers learn teamwork in the wild.   Over the next five days, the spark-plug executives woulddiscover gears they never knew they had. Among their daily feats,they clawed up a 70-foot cliff blindfolded and scaled a 13,000-footpeak, posing for photographs at the summit like an Everest assaultteam.   ``In a couple of days I'll be back in the office saying, `Wow,did I do all that stuff?''' says Jerry L. Brasiola, manager ofChampion's international manufacturing operations.   The executives were sent to Outward Bound as an experiment byChampion, one of a growing number of companies introducingadventure into management training to build camaraderie andcultivate leadership.   Having come of age in the long economic expansion of the 1980s,executive training camps have themselves become a growth industrywith scores of programs attracting thousands of corporate customers.   No longer dismissed as a passing fad, the programs have becomestandard operating procedure for many companies.   Part of the idea is to confound, surprise, shock and scaremanagers into breaching preconceived limits and thinking about newways of doing things. The programs often are a mixture of seminars,scout camp, serious self-reflection and good-natured jokes aboutsore muscles.   ``We'll give you just enough advance warning about what you'lldo, so you won't spend a lot of time worrying about it,'' theChampion group was told by Stephen McCormick, head of ColoradoOutward Bound's Professional Development Program.   The training partly reflects a shift in what companies areseeking in a leader. They still want scrappy soldiers who aren'tafraid to brawl with rivals to achieve success. But they also wantpeople with compassion, humility, vision and willingness to manageby consensus, not edict.   Though its heyday arrived only recently, adventure education hasbeen around since Outward Bound first trained British sailors towithstand the ordeal of German U-boat attacks in World War II.   Today, the school offers courses in wilderness settings on fivecontinents, from Himalayan mountaineering to sailing off the coastof Maine.   Outward Bound remains by far the largest adventure trainer amongat least 70 competing programs. Enrollment has nearly doubled tomore than 4,000 men and women annually over the past few years,according to Donna Thompson, spokeswoman for Outward Bound USAnational headquarters in Greenwich, Conn.   Clients range from giants like General Electric Co. toentrepreneurs in the pizza business, which pay anywhere from $150to more than $300 a day to throw people into physical challengesthey've never faced before.   ``Most people at these events will say, `I can't do that.' Andmost people don't want to try because it scares the hell out ofthem,'' says Roy Yamahiro, a Federal Express Corp. vice presidentwho helped design the Colorado Outward Bound corporate program.   ``It's the worst thing that can happen in life and business,''he says. ``If you're fearful of taking risks, your whole life islimited. That, in a simplistic way, is what Outward Bound does. Thewilderness is a classroom for coming face to face with conqueringthings you can't do.''   But some critics contend adventure training can becounterproductive and hurt morale, especially among workers who maybe physically disabled.   Others say most adventure trainers have no hard-core businessacumen and don't understand the reality of the work place. A fewwonder how climbing rocks or dangling from ropes will translateinto higher productivity and profits.   ``My sense is that it's a beginning, a first step,'' says WarrenBennis, professor of management at the University of SouthCalifornia. ``How do you re-create that same environment within thecompany? That's the real issue. Unless the environment issupportive and compatible with the kind of lessons you learn inoutdoor education, it can have a backlash or even lower morale.''   Ironically, part of the backlash may be a function of theprograms' popularity. They have become so ingrained in somecorporate cultures, the thrill of participation seems to have wornthin. In the Champion group, for example, some participants balkedat quitting cigarettes, complained about the alcohol ban and vowedto gorge themselves on steak and liquor when it was over.   Others grumbled about the hard bunks in the school's Leadvillebase camp, the early-morning jogs and bone-chilling dip in thestream, which instructors cheerfully describe as an Outward Boundtradition.   Still, at the end of the Champion course, many members of thegroup said they had enjoyed it despite blistered feet and altitudeheadaches from the thin mountain air. A few had second thoughts.   ``It depends on the people,'' says Kjell Karlsen, 30-year-oldchief of Champion's European financial operations. ``You could havea 300-pound manager who works great in the office. But if you stuckhim out here, you'd kill him.''   Although accidents are rare, outdoor corporate training programsstrictly enforce safety, partly because of tragedies that havebefallen executives who venture into the wilderness on their own.   In late July, the chief executive officer of New EnglandElectric System was struck and killed by lightning whilepeak-climbing with his wife in Aspen, Colo. About a year ago, fiveadvertising executives died in a white-water rafting accident inBritish Columbia.   Anyone over age 45 on an Outward Bound course needs a doctor'spermission to participate. Climbers must wear helmets. The school'srule No. 1 for peak expeditions: Quit in a thunderstorm and headbelow timberline.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
