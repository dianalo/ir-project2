Silvey said the man was tentatively identified as Buck Helms,57, hometown not immediately known. He was alone in a ChevroletSprint automobile.   Helms had a steady pulse and was apparently in stable condition,Silvey said.   Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson was at the scene when the man wasrescued and saw the man wave his arms.   ``When he came out, it was just an incredible and a wonderfulsight to see after he had been there some 89 hours,'' the mayorsaid.   Rescue operations had been suspended Friday night because the1\-mile stretch of Interstate 880 became too unstable. But at 6a.m., a transportation engineer reported seeing movement in aheavily damaged section, and an all-out effort started.   Five fours later, officials said the man was alive.   Workers pushed dirt under the roadbed to stabilize it anddrilled holes in the concrete to reach the victim.   ``It is a very, very dangerous effort,'' said California HighwayPatrol spokesman Mike Garver.   Rain, winds and colder temperatures that began moving in todaywere expected to fill shelters for the homeless this weekend, slowrecovery work and possibly even touch off further landslides acrossearthquake-shaken Northern California.   ``Right now, we're gearing up for a large influx of people,''said Matt McLaughlin, a relief coordinator in Santa Cruz Countysouth of here, where an estimated 10,000 residents have beendisplaced and some have been sleeping outside.   At the fallen stretch of double-deck Interstate 880 in Oakland,   The massive dig to recover bodies from the fallen stretch ofdouble-deck highway in Oakland was suspended Friday night afterworkers felt the roadway shake. High winds were a contributingfactor, a spokesman said.   Telephone-pole-sized timbers were trucked in to help prop upprecariously perched chunks of roadway, and dirt was heapedunderneath for support.   Coordinators said work would continue today _ unless natureinflicts further hardship on the area.   ``It depends on how hard the rain is. If it's not too hard wehope to be able to work through it,'' said Bob Jacobs, deputydistrict director of California Department of Transportation.   The National Weather Service said ``splatterings'' of light rainshowers are moving through the Bay area this morning, and willcontinue through the night. A second system Sunday will bringheavier rain, forecaster Daryl Williams said.   On Friday, state officials raised the estimate of damage fromTuesday's killer quake to $5.5 billion, and coroners reported 55bodies had been recovered as workers dug more than a dozen victimsfrom under tons of freeway concrete in Oakland.   So far, 34 bodies have been uncovered in the freeway rubble.Oakland police said some 85 people are listed as missing.   Building supply stores rushed to fill orders for glass, plywood,cement, flashlights, power generators _ and tarpaulins to shieldfrom the rain.   Rain also raised the threat of additional landslides in themountains north of Santa Cruz, where 60 homes already have beendestroyed in Boulder Creek, a town of 6,800.   ``It's a dangerous area, but all my stuff is here. My dogs arehere. I figured you go down with the ship. Where do you go?'' saidTodd Viele, 27, who decided to stay.   County spokeswoman Dinah Phillips said not enough rain wasexpected to cause widespread land problems.   ``There probably will be some additional landslides, but whereyou really get some serious land and mudslides is where the earthhas been saturated, and we've been having a drought,'' said Ms.Phillips.   National Weather Service forecaster Doug Atkinson said the stormwould probably produce only one-quarter inch of rain.   More than 1,500 aftershocks have hit since Tuesday.   A moderate aftershock measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale strucknear Santa Cruz at 5:50 p.m. PDT, according to the SeismographStation at the University of California at Berkeley. There were noimmediate reports of damage.   At 1:13 a.m. Friday, an aftershock of magnitude 3.9 was centeredabout seven miles southwest of Los Gatos, Berkeley seismologistssaid. It caused additional landslides in that shaky area south ofSan Francisco, and was felt north and south of the city.   The reality of the grim task of uncovering bodies at the I-880disaster appeared to be taking a toll on workers Friday, even asPresident Bush arrived for a tour.   ``You see a car that's crushed, a lot of debris, you usuallyfind the people slumped over the steering wheel,'' said Alamedafirefighter Matt Tunney, who was part of the rescue operation.   ``I'd thought I'd seen everything. This is devastation, theworst disaster I've ever seen,'' he said.   Bush also was struck by what he saw as he toured ravaged areasto offer sympathy, aid and a pledge of no bureaucratic red-tape.   ``I am deeply moved by this, saddened in some ways, yet verystimulated by this team effort,'' the president said.   Bush walked over chunks of concrete beside the 1\-mile crumpledstretch of I-880, where scores of people were feared entombed, andtalked with rescue workers. He had said he hoped to offerencouragement.   Ironworker Joe Carter said the president asked him how hisrescue crew felt.   ``I told him ... we're beat, we're tired, but we're still goingat it,'' Carter said. Bush ``let me know the eyes of the world areon us right now.''   Relief aid continued to stream into the area Friday. But themost urgent requirement was for money to help relocate homelessfamilies from sheltersto temporary living quarters such as hotels,a Red Cross official said.   About 5,000 people have been housed in 30 shelters in the regionaffected by Tuesday's quake, the Red Cross said.   Members of the San Francisco Giants, participants in baseball'ssuspended World Series, visited a downtown shelter Friday to handout souvenir balls, caps and T-shirts to families left homeless bythe quake.   Scientists roaming through mountains southeast of San Franciscopinpointed the epicenter of Tuesday's 5:04 p.m. killer quake in thenortheast corner of the Nisene Marks State Park, near the top ofAptos Creek, said Joseph Cotton with the U.S. Geological Survey inMenlo Park.   That's about 57 miles from San Francisco atop the San AndreasFault, and just 14 miles northeast Santa Cruz.   The scientists converged on the Santa Cruz Mountains to look forthe origins of the earthquake. Geologists were investigatingwhether a fissure hundreds of yards long and as wide as 20 inchesin some spots was in fact the result of the San Andreas Faultrupturing to the surface.   Estimates for reopening the main lifeline between San Franciscoand Oakland, the Bay Bridge, slipped to at least a month.   Engineers hoped to use a floating crane to lift the fallen200-ton, 50-foot-long five-lane highway span onto a barge thisweekend and begin repairs, the transportation department said.   At Stanford University near Palo Alto, 24 building were closedindefinitely, and university President Donald Kennedy said thedestruction ``certainly is going to add up in the many tens ofmillions of dollars.''   Housing for 500 students was damaged, and professors have beenasked to postpone tests.   In San Francisco's Marina district, an upscale neighborhoodwhere lifestyles crumbled along with stucco condominiums and poshapartments, residents stuffed clothes, artwork, furniture andknickknacks into cars, toy wagons and even laundry bags.   The neighborhood was the worst hit in the city because its homeswere built on landfill, not bedrock. As many as 60 homes eithercollapsed or will be torn down.</TEXT></DOC>
