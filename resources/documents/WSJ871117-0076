But he has little track record with such cases, according to Don Berger, a securities law professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, Calif., where Judge Kennedy also teaches. &quot;There is absolutely nothing to go on&quot; to determine his leanings, Professor Berger says.    Government lawyers, nevertheless, said he is likely to be more receptive to upholding government prosecutions of insider trading than was retired Justice Lewis Powell, who often voted against the Securities and Exchange Commission's position on insider trading and other issues.    The justices generally don't make public the voting lineup in 4-4 ties, and yesterday was no exception. However, administration officials familiar with the court's record in insider-trading cases speculated, based on past votes, that those voting to uphold the securities-fraud convictions were Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and John Stevens, and that those rejecting the securities fraud convictions were Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Justices Byron White, Antonin Scalia and Sandra O'Connor. </TEXT></DOC>
