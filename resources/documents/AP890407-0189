The comments appeared to indicate a State Department tilt towardthe Christians, who have been fighting a coalition of Moslemmilitiamen and their Syrian backers in the worst round of civilviolence Lebanon has known for four years.   It was the first time in the latest round of artillery duels,which began four weeks ago, that the State Department has departedfrom its language of neutrality.   Gen. Michel Aoun, who leads the Christian units in Lebanon'sarmy, on Thursday called for a conference between the warring sidesto discuss power-sharing between Christians and Moslems.   ``We have achieved equality in humiliation for 14 years,'' Aounsaid. ``We have to acquire equality today in responsibility,liberation, dignity and partnership.''   ``We have to be partners in making out destiny, because thispartnership alone is bound to realize justice, equality and equalopportunities in a full national sense,'' he said.   Aoun said the Lebanese will have to pay much more dearly if theydelay in achieving unity, security, dignity, stability andreconstruction of their homeland.   ``We welcome the commitment that General Aoun made,'' said theState Department. ``We applaud his recognition that all Lebanesehave the right to security, liberty, and dignity.''   Lebanon's factional violence stems from a political structureinstituted in the 1940s which favors the Christians over theMoslems. But the Moslems, who have increased their numbers and nowconstitute a majority in Lebanon, are demanding a bigger share inrunning the country.   Syria sent troops into Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab Leaguepeacekeeping mandate, but Lebanon's Christians contend the 40,000Syrians are now an occupying power.   ``We are required at once to reject subordination and to rebelagainst the oppressive foreign will,'' Aoun said. ``We mustoverthrow all dictated barriers and handicaps that would lead topartition and meet around a Lebanese-Lebanese table for a free,meaningful, open and honest national dialogue.''   Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said Aoun's callis ``another step down the road'' to a settlement in Lebanon. Buthe conceded that ``I can't say that we can be optimistic about thesituation. I think this shows a path to resolving some of thefundamental problems that are there, and that's why we support it.''</TEXT></DOC>
