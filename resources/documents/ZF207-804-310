(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Wu, D. William.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A simple, noniterative and efficient algorithm is developed thatdetermines the maximum feedrate that a translational contouringrobot (one whose end-effector moves at a constant velocity inrelation to its task without changes in orientation) can handleunder constraints of the robot's joint velocities andaccelerations.andP;  The feedrate along the robot's tool path intranslational contouring tasks largely determines the productivityof the system.andP;  Robot joint velocities and accelerations limit thepotential productivity and must be incorporated into asingle-bounded optimization problem for determining the feedratelimit that the robot can handle.andP;  Details of the development andfunctioning of the algorithm are described.andP;  A computer simulationdemonstrates its effectiveness.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Robot ArmsAlgorithm AnalysisLimitationsPerformance MeasurementTheoretical ResearchKinematicsControl SystemsSimulationRobotics Industry.andO;Feature:   illustrationcharttable.andO;Caption:   Position and orientation of end-effector in base frame.
