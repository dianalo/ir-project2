SRL was asked to recommend a process for removing thesecontaminants and to assist in building a processing plant. A laboratoryscale multivariant study showed that washing the Purex (organic) with1.0 molar nitric acid (aqueous) at organic/aqueous ratio 5 reduced contaminationfrom 500,000 to 50,000 d/m/ml alpha while minimizing contaminated aqueousgeneration. Mixing for sixteen hours followed by two hours settling wasoptimal though four hours mixing was sufficient with 1.0 molar nitricacid. A plant consisting of a 3000 gallon mix tank with a funnel baseand a 500 gallon aqueous makeup tank is recommended. Sodium carbonatesolid or solution is recommended to neutralize the processed organicand aqueous. 2 refs., 3 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
