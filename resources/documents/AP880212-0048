The KGB is the Soviet spy agency.   Both agencies responded to Rep. Dan Mica's statement that morethan 500 reports of infractions by Marines at embassies hadremained in the State Department's files until recently.   Mica, D-Fla., said the reports, which dealt with black marketactivities or fraternization with Soviets, are supposed to beturned over to the Naval Investigative Service for furtherinvestigation.   Mica said his information came from the General AccountingOffice, the congressional watchdog agency, which began looking intosecurity at the embassies in the wake of allegations of espionageat the Moscow embassy.   The KGB often encourages people to engage in illegal behavior asa first step to gaining cooperation with the Soviets, Mica said.   A State Department official, speaking on condition he remainanonymous, said the decision to turn over information about apossible violation by a Marine guard is sometimes made by theMarines, sometimes by the department.   ``There have been instances where one or both passed'' alonginformation to the NIS, the official said. The removal of a Marineis also a joint decision, he said.   Asked about the 578 reports referred to by Mica, the corps said,``The report is actually a listing of the Marine security guardswhose tours of duty as embassy guards were cut short for a varietyof reasons during the period 1980-1987.''   Some Marines were removed for disciplinary reasons; others formedical reasons or for giving a substandard performance, thestatement said.   Of the security guards sent home between 1985-1987 ``only ahandful could be said to relate to espionage.'' During that period,only one Marine, Sgt. Clayton Lonetree, has been convicted ofespionage for his activities in Moscow.   The Marines said they had not known about the list of 578 untilJune 1987 ``when it surfaced at the Department of State.''   Mica was not available to comment because he is in Floridapreparing to announce his candidacy for U.S. Senate. But hisspokesman, John Gersuk, said infractions on the list could havebeen things other than black marketeering or fraternizationviolations.   Mica has said the various agencies' procedures for handlingpotential security problems are chaotic and may need to beoverhauled.</TEXT></DOC>
