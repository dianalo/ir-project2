The extraction equilibrium constant wasdetermined by the usual slope method and found to be lg{beta}/sub 12/= 7.65 (20 deg C). By determining the effects of temperature on the distributionratio, {Delta}H, {Delta}Z and {Delta}S of the reaction was evaluatedas follow: {Delta}H = -7.14 kcalcenter dotmol/sup -1/, {Delta}Z = -10.3kcalcenter dotmol/sup -3/, {Delta}S = -10.6 kcalcenter dotK/sup -1/.In term of cone packing model a possible structure of the synergic extractingcomplex was proposed.</TEXT></DOC>
