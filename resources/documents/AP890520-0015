Congressman over DisclosureForms</HEAD><BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rep. Charles G. Rose III, D-N.C., has becomethe first member of Congress to be sued by the Justice Departmentunder the financial disclosure provisions of the Ethics inGovernment Act.   A civil lawsuit filed Friday in U.S. District Court inWashington accuses Rose of failing to report on his federalfinancial disclosure statements $138,694 in loans he obtained oversix years.   The department sought $30,000 in civil penalties for the sixalleged violations of the Ethics in Government Act. It also soughtan injunction to bar future violations of the reportingrequirements of the law.   The lawsuit charged Rose, who is chairman of the HouseAgriculture tobacco and peanuts subcommittee, failed to report theloans from his campaign and financial institutions on the annualdisclosure forms filed from 1980 through 1986, excepting 1983.   Rose's personal loans were obtained both from financialinstitutions and his campaign fund, from which he borrowed $52,995,according to the complaint.   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said Rose is the firstmember of Congress to be sued under the financial disclosureprovisions of the Ethics in Government Act.   In a statement, Rose said the lawsuit was intended to ``force meto file amendments which the House Ethics Committee has not askedme to file and to pay a fine for amendments (to disclosure forms) Ihave already filed.''   Rose said House leaders have told him they would support him inthe lawsuit because ``the litigation hinders the continued abilityof the (ethics) committee to serve as the primary enforcer of thereporting requirements for members of the House.''   In a Feb. 9 letter to a Justice Department official, Houseethics committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., and rankingminority member John T. Myers, R-Ind., said they believed theircommittee already had taken appropriate action in the case bypermitting Rose to amend his disclosure form to reflect the loans.   The financial disclosure forms are filed each year by members ofCongress by May 15 to cover the preceding calendar year.   The law requires members to report liabilities exceeding $10,000on the disclosure forms and provides for civil penalties up to$5,000 for each violation.   The complaint charged that Rose filed incomplete financialdisclosure forms by failing to mention both new loans and thoseoutstanding from previous years that totaled more than $10,000.   In March 1988, the House ethics committee rebuked Rose afterconcluding he improperly borrowed funds from his campaign andfailed to report the loans on his financial disclosure reports. Thecommittee said it found ``clear and convincing evidence'' of Houserules violations, and said Rose's behavior was ``deserving ofreproach.''</TEXT></DOC>
