Petersen, a bank vice president.andP;  About 20financial analysts and planners in the bank's corporate planning andcommunications departments use Macintoshes to prepare various in-housepublications.andM;NatWest keeps the VAXes and Macs running together by using PacerShare fromPacer Software, of La Jolla, Calif.andP;  PacerShare is a VAX-basedAppleShare-compatible file server on PacerLink networking software.andM;Integrating the system cost &quot;a hair under $400,000&quot; for hardware, softwareand the network, Petersen said.andM;A member of the London-based National Westminster Group, NatWest USA servicesconsumer and commercial accounts for New York City and the greater New Yorkmetropolitan region.andP;  NatWest USA also serves other U.S.andP;  customers as wellas foreign concerns.andM;The bank's strategy for implementing a new system involved configuring acolor graphics information system based upon &quot;a workstation that would makeanalysts as productive as possible,&quot; Petersen said.andM;NatWest officials expect to save $50,000 to $60,000 in desktop publishingcosts alone--using the Macintosh, Petersen said.andM;For NatWest, the best option was the VAX-Mac offering.andP;  The bank hadpreviously farmed out most of its desktop publishing and slide creation jobs,he said.andM;&quot;Any time we do a slide show, we save $2,500 to $3,000&quot; Petersen said.andP;  Witheach slide show requiring 30 to 50 slides, the bank could save as much as$40,000 annually, he said.andM;Petersen said NatWest had looked for a vendor that could &quot;cover as much ofthe total solution as possible,&quot; but the planning and corporate communicationdepartments bucked an IBM trend.andP;  The bank seriously considered Big Blue'sofferings, &quot;but the software cost a heck of a lot more, and required a lotmore machine,&quot; he said.andM;Petersen said he had originally considered going with a single vendor becausea multiple-vendor situation could lead to administrative woes.andP;  For example,the bank considered IBM's 9370 and PS/2 line of personal computers instead ofthe MicroVAX II and Macs, but IBM's new products lacked track records ofsuccess, Petersen said.andM;&quot;There was no proof that they were going to be ideal,&quot; he said.andP;  Also, DEC'sproducts were not as expensive as Big Blue's, &quot;and we could get more bang forthe buck,&quot; he added.andM;The entire project--from the planning stages to implementation--took aboutthree years before the network became operational last year.andM;In all, NatWest had evaluated offerings from DEC, IBM and Wang Laboratories.andO;Before making the final choice, NatWest officials sent each vendor aquestionnaire querying officials on various issues, including level ofsoftware support and service.andM;NatWest assigned scores based upon responses, he said.andP;  In the support andservice areas, the company did not rate Wang as high, Petersen said.andM;Two factors that weighed heavily in the bank's final decision were theDEC-Apple alliance--formalized in January 1988--and their software supportfor the VAX.andP;  Wang did not offer that same level of software support, hesaid.andM;NatWest also uses various financial analysis tools in presentations--whichwould have to be integrated with the new system--a factor that influenced thecompany's decision in choosing the VAX-Mac strategy.andP;  The company usesfinancial analysis products from Austin, Texas-based Execucom Systems; Cary,N.C.-based SAS Institute; and Belmont, Calif.-based Oracle.andM;The bank carried on &quot;elongated discussions&quot; about including a DEC product inwhat was essentially an IBM shop, Petersen said.andP;  Among the issues officialsgrappled with was the lack of DEC expertise within the bank, he said.andM;&quot;There was no one who could support us except ourselves,&quot; he said.andM;Why the Mac?andM;NatWest ultimately decided on the Macintosh because it &quot;had impressed us asearly as 1986,&quot; Petersen said.andP;  The bank had considered color VAXmates andPCs.andP;  But DEC never released a color VAXmate, and PCs had &quot;exoticprogramming&quot; that would detract from analysts' time.andM;&quot;We felt that their time would be better spent on analysis rather than onlearning the PC,&quot; he said.andP;  Also, color VAXmates or PCs would not providebank analysts with the ease of use, graphics or connectivity provided by theMacintosh-VAX link.andM;&quot;The Mac-DEC ability to grab information easily certainly had a great deal ofbearing on that decision,&quot; Petersen said.andP;  &quot;You had a vast array of softwarefor DEC and IBM, but little for Wang.&quot;andM;With the Macs and MicroVAX, the bank can do more &quot;board level&quot; briefingreports and proposals that focus on corporate planning and development.andO;Also, with the system's slide-production capabilities, the bank can createpresentations much more quickly and cost-effectively, Petersen said.andM;Now, corporate communications--brochures, in-house newspapers and economicnewsletters--are being handled by a staff without a publishing background.andO;In the future, though, the bank might consider hiring &quot;someone with a graphicdesign background,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;We are able to undertake far more now,&quot; he said.andP;  Within three hours, staffmembers were &quot;almost fully trained.&quot;andM;Macs Require AdjustmentandM;On the surface, integrating Macs and VAXes would seem straightforward,Petersen said.andP;  But the Macintosh will require more than a few adjustmentsfrom users, he said.andP;  Mac users will have to contend with multiple fileformats, and probably need to master several different software programs, headded.andM;&quot;There's a phenomenal amount to learn about the Mac,&quot; Petersen said.andM;For example, the integration of graphics and text files involves many moresteps than it might appear at first, Petersen said.andP;  It cannot all be done ona single package.andP;  After the graphics are created, they have to beincorporated into text.andP;  If a slide is to be created, then it will have to gothrough another process, he said.andM;&quot;When you're all done, you will have touched on six different programs,&quot;Petersen said.andP;  &quot;You have to be aware of that.&quot;andM;The up side of the equation is that there are a great many software packagesfor the Macintosh, and they're inexpensive, Petersen said.andM;In addition, the MicroVAX's functions are &quot;straightforward and it sits therequietly doing its job,&quot; Petersen said.andP;  The VAX, serving as an informationserver, is not a graphics tool but &quot;keeps it all together,&quot; he added.andM;Connecting the MicroVAX and Macintoshes was &quot;one of the easiest&quot; aspects ofthe new implementation, Petersen said.andP;  With PacerShare, the MicroVAX acts asa virtual disk file server for the Macintoshes, he said.andM;Usage of the Macs and the VAX might spread to other departments, Petersensaid, though they probably will use a different hardware and softwareconfiguration.andM;&quot;They can build on the trail we blazed,&quot; Petersen said.andM;&quot;Now, there are a lot more DEC machines.andP;  A different kind of user expertiseis developing,&quot; he added.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
