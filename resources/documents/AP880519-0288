The GAO, the auditing arm of Congress, said the Federal Savingsand Loan Insurance Corp.'s liabilities exceeded its assets at theend of 1987 by $13.7 billion, up from the deficit of $6.3 billion ayear earlier.   In testimony prepared for the Senate Banking Committee, the GAOsaid the fund, which guarantees individual deposits up to $100,000in 3,120 Sandamp;Ls, was in ``precarious financial condition.''   It said the money available to the fund ``probably will not beadequate'' to resolve the problems of the nation's 505 insolventinstitutions.   ``While FSLIC has the resources to continue operating in thenear future, it may not have sufficient resources to effectivelydeal with the industry's current and future problems,'' FrederickD. Wolf, director of the GAO's accounting and financial managementdivision, said in the testimony.   Replying to the GAO, M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board, which regulates federally insured Sandamp;Ls, said thedeficit does not mean the insurance fund lacks cash to deal withcurrent problems. He said it has $4 billion and Sandamp;L customers``should be assured their deposits are fully insured.''   Wall said the fact that FSLIC may need more money down the road``comes as a surprise to no one.'' But he added, ``The thing I'msensitive to is that there not be any kind of unneccessary concernin the time sense. We clearly have significant amounts of resourcesavailable to deal with (the worst 200 institutions.) After that,you get into predicting the future.''   The GAO report comes only nine months after Congress authorizedthe sale of $10.8 billion in bonds over three years to bring thefund enough money to clean up the ailing industry, which has beenhard hit by the bust of oil and real estate markets in theSouthwest.   ``We believe that further congressional action, beyond thatalready taken, ... may well be needed to enable (the fund) tocontinue to meet its obligations and provide the deposit insuranceit is mandated to provide,'' the accounting office said.   Although Wolf did not explicitly say a taxpayer bailout will berequired, he said ``it appears unlikely that the industry wouldhave the resources to provide such funding.''   Officials of the bank board expect the bond sales, the premiumfees it charges institutions and the proceeds from selling theassets of closed institutions to provide about $20 billion over thenext three years and $28 billion over 10 years.   However, Wolf said, ``We view FSLIC's projections withsignificant reservations.'' He said the agency's estimates of boththe cost of the bailout and the money it will have to spend are toooptimistic.   Bank board officials last month had estimated the FSLIC deficitat $11.6 billion _ $2.1 billion less than the GAO figure. They alsosaid it would cost $15.3 billion to take care of the worst-off 204thrift institutions and a total of $21.8 billion to rescue allinsolvent thrifts.   However, the GAO said it would cost $17.4 billion to resolve theproblems of ``the more than 200 hopelessly insolvent institutions''and $26.4 billion to $36.4 billion to clean up all insolvent Sandamp;Ls.   The GAO warned that this figure does not include an additional435 institutions, which it said are ``barely solvent.''   Private analysts have estimated the total cost of restoring theindustry to health to be as high as $60 billion.   In making its $21.8 billion estimate, the bank board is assumingthat interest rates will not increase significantly and thatvirtually no new problem cases will develop in the next 10 years _a view Wolf called ``extremely optimistic.''   Regulators also are assuming that insured deposits would grow by7 percent a year and that nearly all healthy Sandamp;Ls would remain inthe insurance fund even after a law blocking their withdrawalexpires in August. Growth of deposits slowed in 1985, 1986 and 1987and has only been accelerating since last October.   Also, if a special insurance premium assessed Sandamp;Ls is continuedas the bank board expects, healthy thrifts would be encouraged toleave FSLIC to avoid the added cost. That would reduce its depositbase and income further, Wolf said.   But, he said, ``Without continuing the special assessment, thereis no shred of hope of resolving FSLIC's financial plight withoutturning to the taxpayer.''   Bank board officials also project the interest rate on bondsfloated to recapitalize the insurance fund will remain below 10percent even though rates already are edging higher.   And, they assume they will take care of most ailing Sandamp;Ls bymerging them with healthier institutions, a cheaper alternativethan shutting down an institution and paying off depositors.   However, the GAO noted that over the last five years, 37 percentof the cases have been resolved through liquidations, and of theremaining cases resolved by merger, some have resulted ininstitutions that are still weak, only bigger.   Wolf also said regulators are counting on investors to takeFSLIC notes, rather than cash, in exchange for taking over anailing institution. That, he said, ``remains an open question.''   Wall replied that because the economy has strengthened it is``clearly not the case anymore'' that there is a lack of interestin mergers.   ``We have more interest in these institutions (in Texas) than weever expected. ... We have an embarrasment of riches in thatsense,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
