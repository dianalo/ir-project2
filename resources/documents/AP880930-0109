North and two other Iran-Contra defendants toscuttle charges they illegally diverted Iranian arms-sale proceedsto the Nicaraguan rebels.   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hererejected as premature the appeal of U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell's refusal to dismiss charges against North, a former WhiteHouse aide; ex-national security adviser John Poindexter, and armsdealer Albert Hakim.   The appeals court said it does not have the jurisdiction, untilthe three defendants are tried, to consider claims that thecongressional testimony they gave under limited immunity fromprosecution had been illegally used against them.   Such claims could be raised if the three defendants areconvicted and file appeals, the court said.   The court also dismissed a petition by the defendants, who werejoined by the American Civil Liberties Union, asking that Gesell beordered to dismiss the charges or hold additional pre-trialhearings on the immunity issue.   North, Poindexter and Hakim had contended that the pervasivepublicity that resulted from their congressional testimonyinevitably ``tainted'' the grand jury that indicted them in March.   The three, who were compelled to testify before the House andSenate Iran-Contra committees under so-called ``use immunity,''argued that, given the widespread publicity, their testimony wasinevitably used against them in violation of their constitutionalrights against self-incrimination.   Under the law, the immunized testimony of a witness granted``use immunity'' cannot be used against him as evidence.   The three defendants asked the appeals court to order Gesell todismiss the indictment or to hold pre-trial hearings to more fullyexplore whether grand jurors or witnesses before the secret panelhad been exposed to ``tainted'' evidence.   Gesell refused to dismiss the indictment and held onlypreliminary hearings on the issue of grand jury taint, saying thematter could be taken up at post-trial hearings.   The appeals court, in an unsigned opinion, said it could notrule on the issues until after any convictions are appealed.   The defendants ``have failed to demonstrated how the remedyafforded by direct appeal will be `clearly inadequate' to correctthe perceived wrong,'' the appeals court said.   ``If appellants are correct in their assertion of unfairlyprejudicial error, and those errors are properly preserved forappeal, vacation of the judgment of conviction and dismissal of theindictment will provide a full and fair remedy to appellants.'' thecourt said.   ``Appellants may ultimately be correct in their assertion thatif the grand jury's probable cause determination was `tainted' bythe use of immunized testimony, dismissal of the indictment will berequired to remedy the harm,'' said Circuit Judges James L.Buckley, Douglas H. Ginsburg and David Sentelle.   But the panel noted that the Supreme Court frowns on piecemealor so-called interlocutory appeals in the middle of a proceeding.   ``Even when vindication of the defendants' rights requiresdismissal of the charge altogether, however, an interlocutoryappeal is not automatically justified,'' the court said.   ``If the claimed error will not be important enough to warrantcorrection on appeal from final judgment, it most assuredly is notimportant enough to warrant the extraordinary step of aninterlocutory appeal,'' the court said.   Gesell has ordered separate trials for North, Poindexter andHakim. A fourth defendant in the case, arms dealer Richard V.Secord, testified on Capitol Hill without immunity from prosecutionand therefore was not part of the legal challenge. Secord will alsobe tried separately.   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has elected to try Northfirst, but the trial is not expected to begin until next year.Gesell postponed the trial indefinitely to give prosecutorsadditional time to process massive numbers of classified documentsthat North may be entitled to use for his defense.   In a statement following today's ruling, Walsh said: ``The Courtof Appeals decision is most welcome and permits us to concentrateon pursuing the cases awaiting trial.''</TEXT></DOC>
