The Red Cross delegate told reporters in Geneva that he spentmuch of his days thinking ``about my life, my work for the RedCross, which I would like to continue. But I fear it will not beagain in Lebanon.''   But he said he was ``even more motivated now to work for the RedCross.''   Winkler, 32, said his captors never identified themselves or toldhim why they kidnapped him Nov. 17 in the city of Sidon, where hedirected operations for the International Committee of the Red Cross.   Winkler, freed Friday in Sidon, said he was treated well but was``very much afraid.''   The former hostage smiled when he stepped down from a CyprusAirways plane in Geneva before continuing to German-speakingSwitzerland to meet his parents.   ``I went through moments of crisis which I have never gonethrough before and which I hope I will never go through again,'' hetold reporters. He declined to elaborate, saying, ``It's toopersonal.''   Winkler said he did not know whether his release might mean thatother hostages also would be freed.   Swiss Foreign Minister Rene Felber said Saturday that Winkler'sabductors tried to make his release conditional on a lenientsentence for a jailed Lebanese Shiite Moslem hijacker held inSwitzerland, which refused to make any concessions.   Hussein Hariri, 22, hijacked an Air Afrique plane to Geneva July14, 1987, and killed a French passenger before he was subdued andarrested. He is to go on trial Feb. 20 and faces a maximum sentenceof life in prison if convicted.   Winkler said his captors ``dictated word for word'' hishandwritten note early this month. It said in English, ``Mygovernment knows what my kidnappers want from it, and it has tocooperate in order to save my life.''   The Swiss foreign minister said the kidnappers identifiedthemselves as members of a dissident Palestinian group callingitself the ``Organization of Socialist Revolution.''   Winkler said he was kept in solitary confinement, but did notknow where. He said he never saw the faces of his captors, who wereeither masked or blindfolded.   During the captivity, he was able to listen to news broadcasts bythe British Broadcasting Corp. and Radio Monte Carlo, Winkler said.He also had a Bible and four English- and French-language books,including Marcel Pagnol's ``The Time of Secrecy.''   ``I did not manage to finish it,'' he added, laughing.   Red Cross spokesman Carlos Bauverd said its policy was never tosend a delegate back to a region where he or she had a ``problem.''Winkler was the first International Red Cross delegate to be takenhostage.   Bauverd said the Red Cross would ``probably'' resume operationsin south Lebanon, which were stopped after Winkler's abduction. Hesaid the staff, which had been cut from 27 to 17, likely would beincreased.</TEXT></DOC>
