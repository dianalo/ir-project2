(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker said Wednesday he's not out ofthe PTL picture, even though it appears most of the assets of thetelevision ministry he founded will be bought by a Canadianbusinessman.   ``It's not over till it's over, as I've been saying,'' Bakkersaid in front of the new Jim and Tammy Information Office about twomiles from Heritage USA, site of PTL's Christian theme park andtelevision studios. ``It seems every few weeks we go through it'sbeen sold again, and sold again.''   PTL's court-appointed trustee, M.C. ``Red'' Benton announcedTuesday he had signed a contract with Stephen Mernick of Toronto tobuy the ministry's assets for $115 million. Benton had identifiedother potential buyers but had not previously gotten to thecontract stage.   Charlotte, N.C., attorney Joseph Kluttz said his client Mernickwill pay $50 million at closing for the deal and pay the $65million balance over five years.   Mernick has not said what he plans to do with Heritage USA, butwrote in a Sept. 15 letter to Benton that he would consider``preserving or enhancing the Christian orientation'' even thoughhe is an Orthodox Jew.   PTL must sell its assets to pay creditors as soon as possibleunder an order from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds inColumbia.   Bakker, who left the now crumbling evangelical empire in March1987 amid a sex-and-money scnadal, said he would not consider theramifications of a PTL sale ``until I hear the final gavel of thejudge.''   ``It still has to be ratified by the judge, by the creditors,and then it's still subject to the condition upon transfer of thesatellite contract _ (which) is a non-transferrable contract, sothat has to be approved,'' Bakker said.   ``Then Mr. Mernick has 30 days to just walk away with nopenalties, if he wants to,'' Bakker said.   ``That to me is not as strong a deal as I would have liked tohave seen, anybody who can just walk away without losing somethinghas a pretty good deal on his side.''   Benton has said other bidders may present offers directly to thebankruptcy court, but he said his recommendation gives Mernick'soffer a strong upper hand. Reynolds is expected to hold a hearingon the sale about a month from now.   Bakker proposed a $172 million plan to buy the ministry'sassets, but his bid lost credibility last month when he could notcome up with a $3 million down payment.   Convinced he still can put together a deal and eventuallyrestore his television ministry, Bakker has assembled a staff thatshares his faith.   ``We know Jim and Tammy will be restored, we just don't knowwhat route God will use to accomplish that,'' said Lin Robertson,who was answering one of the many phones ringing at the informationcenter.   ``And when they get back to Heritage, it will be done in such away that everybody will know it was done by the hand of God, not bythe hand of man,'' Ms. Robertson said.   ``God is moving on Jim's behalf,'' said Joyce LeBaron, referringto the Bakkers hoped-for return to television.   ``We're really not concerned about Mr. Mernick, we're not upsetabout it at all,'' said Peggy Licata. ``It's just an interimthing.''</TEXT></DOC>
