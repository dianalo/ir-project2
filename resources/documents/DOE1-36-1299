Inorder to test thermal characteristics in situ, a heater test with thebuffer material was carried out at 40 m depth below surface in graniterock mass. The compacted test material was placed around a electric heaterin a test hole, 1 m diameter 5 m depth, and heated about 1800 hours withno groundwater flow into the hole. There was a heat-induced redistributionof the original water content through which partial drying took placeclose to the heater, while water was accumulated the outside of the dryarea. Comparing with the observed temperature distribution and the calculatedone which was obtained by FEM-based calculation, it was revealed thatthe thermal conductivity of the buffer material changed depending onthe temperature and moisture during the heater experiment.</TEXT></DOC>
