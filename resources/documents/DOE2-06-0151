ECPA incorporates significantamendments to Part I of the Federal Power Act (FPA) regarding the issuanceof licenses for hydroelectric projects. The ostensible purpose of ECPAis to provide greater protection for energy consumers. Unfortunately,ECPA has little to do with protecting consumers of electricity. To thecontrary, it may actually be detrimental to a larger number of consumersthan it helps, because it will make the development of hydroelectricpower, an economically efficient and environmentally sound source ofenergy, more complex, more time-consuming, and more expensive. Brieflystates, Congress in ECPA directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions(FERC) when issuing licenses, to give an upgraded level of considerationto energy conservation, fish and wildlife protection, recreational opportunities,andenvironmental quality.</TEXT></DOC>
