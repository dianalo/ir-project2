About $265 million of debt is affected.

Moody's added that the company's commitment to distribute to shareholders units in Freeport-McMoRan Energy Partners and shares in Freeport McMoRan Gold Co. is likely to result in significant shrinkage in the company's asset base. A spokesman at the energy and mining concern declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
