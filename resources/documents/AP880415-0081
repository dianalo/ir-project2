The army clamped a curfew on the Palestinian refugee camp ofShati in the Gaza Strip, and curfews remained in effect in the WestBank camps of Balata, Jelazoun and Amari.   No violent disturbances were reported.   Near the West Bank town of Beita, the site of a clash 10 daysago between teen-aged Israeli hikers and Arab villagers in which a15-year-old Israeli girl was killed, dozens of Jewish settlers heldtheir own hike to show they would still circulate in the area.   The hike ended without violence, but settlers complained about aheavy army presence, Israel army radio said.   A spokesman for the civil adminstration in the West Bank saidteachers in the territories had been given a three-week mandatoryholiday with half pay, pending an army decision May 8 whether toreopen schools. Schools have been closed since early February in aneffort to thwart student protests.   Also Friday, military panels began hearing the appeals of fiveout of 12 Palestinians ordered deported this week on charges ofinciting recent unrest.   On Thursday, Israeli troops shot and killed two Palestiniansafter demonstrators pelted them with rocks and cinder blocks. FourPalestinians were wounded in clashes in the West Bank. Among themwas a 12-year-old boy who lost an eye.   The deaths brought to 146 the number of Arabs killed since theunrest broke out Dec. 8. An Israeli soldier and a 15-year-oldJewish settler also have died.   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the army's chief of staff, said the numberand scope of Arab protests in the occupied lands is declining, sothat when soldiers fire on rioters those hit are usuallyringleaders.   A general strike called Thursday to protest the arrest of nearly5,000 Palestinians since December brought commerce to a virtualstandstill in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Nevertheless, Shomron said Arabs were tiring after 18 weeks ofviolence in the territories Israel seized in the 1967 Middle Eastwar.   Shomron said protests now involve only Palestinian activists,``so when soldiers are forced to fire, they usually hit theinciters themselves.''   ``Many people are simply not going out or don't have enoughmotivation to keep it up with the same energy,'' Shomron said.``You see it in the field.''   The most serious clash Thursday occurred in the narrow streetsof the Nablus central market, where shops were shuttered because ofthe general strike.   Hospital officials and Arab reporters said youths on rooftopsthrew stones and cinder blocks at soldiers, who opened fire andkilled two Palestinians. The army confirmed the deaths but said itwas investigating the circumstances.   An official at Al Ittihad Hospital said two other Arabs wereshot and wounded.   In another clash in nearby Tulkarem, a 12-year-old boy lost hisright eye after being hit with a rubber bullet, an official atRafidiyeh Hospital in Nablus said. A 17-year-old Palestinian wasshot in the stomach and listed in critical condition.   Two Jewish children were slightly injured when the bus they wereriding was stoned near the Jewish settlement of Tekoa, south ofJerusalem, Israel radio reported.   It said an Israeli passenger bus also was stoned on theJerusalem-Tel Aviv highway near the Arab village of Abu Gosh. Thevehicle's front windshield was smashed, but there were no injuries.</TEXT></DOC>
