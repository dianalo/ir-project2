The maker of materials-handling equipment said it advised its major bank lender that the development may result in a technical default of its bank loan. It added that discussions are under way and that the bank doesn't plan to take any action until an audit is completed. It said it expects that to occur by March 30.    Last year, net income was $702,000, including an extraordinary credit of $267,900, on revenue of $15.7 million. </TEXT></DOC>
