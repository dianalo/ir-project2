On Friday, WPP, a London marketing services company, agreed to buy JWT for $55.50 a share, or $566 million. The accord, worked out in the early morning during a more than seven-hour JWT board meeting, capped two weeks of WPP's insistent pursuit. During that time, WPP raised its per-share offer from $45 to $50.50 to $55.50 despite the lack of any publicly declared competing bids. Several other parties bid, sources say, but all but two dropped out before the all-night meeting, and they couldn't compete with WPP's proposal.    JWT shares closed Friday at $55.125, up $2.25, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Some analysts had called the initial $45-a-share offer a full price, and they were leery of the final terms. &quot;It's a tremendous deal for JWT shareholders,&quot; said James Dougherty of County Securities USA. &quot;But I don't think I'd make that comment for WPP shareholders. It dilutes the earnings . . . and adds a substantial amount of debt.&quot; WPP will be swallowing a company more than 15 times its size: JWT had 1986 revenue of $641 million compared with WPP's about $37.9 million.    Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive officer, &quot;is paying more than what the company is worth,&quot; added Charles Crane of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Nevertheless, Mr. Crane said, Mr. Sorrell &quot;is probably the one person that could make this whole thing work.&quot; And other analysts said that if Mr. Sorrell turns around JWT's financial performance, JWT may boost WPP's per-share earnings significantly beginning in 1989.    WPP sees strong value in JWT's well-established brand-name advertising and public-relations units. Also, Mr. Sorrell, formerly top financial officer at the advertising giant Saatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC, has an excellent reputation for financial management.    The agreement marks the end of a fierce struggle by JWT and its chairman and chief executive, Don Johnston, to keep the ad concern -- which dates back to 1864 -- independent. JWT, whose clients include Ford Motor Co. and International Business Machines Corp., and whose J. Walter Thompson Co. is the nation's fourth-largest agency, has been the subject of takeover speculation since last fall. It has been &quot;in play&quot; since January, when Mr. Johnston fired his heir apparent, Joseph O'Donnell, for passing along an outside buyout bid.    With the agreement in place, WPP's immediate job will be to appease concerned clients. Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co., a $30 million client, has said it would drop Thompson as its ad agency if WPP succeeded. On Friday, James K. DeVoe, vice president, advertising, said that Goodyear is putting up its account for review, and he added: &quot;This client is not transferable. Agencies do not select clients; clients select agencies.&quot;    Potentially more significant, Ford, Thompson's largest client with about $230 million in billings, also said it will put up its account for review. A spokesman said the review doesn't indicate that Ford necessarily will drop Thompson.    At Eastman Kodak Co., a Thompson client for 56 years, J. Phillip Samper, vice chairman and executive officer, said in a statement that &quot;no change is anticipated in the service and handling of the Kodak account. . . . We intend to carefully review the situation.&quot; An IBM spokeswoman said that it is &quot;too early to assess what impact, if any, the merger will have.&quot;    Mr. Sorrell, 42 years old, said, &quot;It's very important now to get back to business and look after servicing clients after the unsettling period of the last six to nine months.&quot; He also said he has no plans to sell any of JWT's units.    JWT sought competing offers last week to combat WPP, but the bids fell short. Sources said that by Thursday afternoon, which was JWT's deadline for bidders, only two others emerged: Riordan, Freeman andamp; Spogli, a small West Coast leveraged-buyout firm, for about $50 a share; and Lazard Freres andamp; Co. along with three former Ted Bates Worldwide executives, which didn't have financing in place.    Sources said other potential bidders dropped out earlier because of price resistance, including Warburg Pincus and a group composed of Rockefeller Group, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., and Chase Manhattan Corp. That group briefly considered placing Peter Dailey, a former ad executive, in a senior JWT position, sources say.    JWT also gave &quot;aggressive consideration&quot; to a management buyout, said Stephen G. Bowen, president of the Thompson unit. Other sources said the proposed buyout involved selling JWT's Hill andamp; Knowlton public relations unit to Interpublic Group of Cos. and its Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein advertising unit to Ogilvy Group Inc. for a total of $150 million. That effort would have been able to pay only in the low 50s per share, however.    Despite industry speculation that Mr. Johnston would be pushed out if WPP succeeded, he indicated in an internal memo Friday that he and other top executives will stay on. Some industry people said they believed Mr. Johnston, 60, will remain through the transition period but not much longer. Mr. Johnston didn't return calls seeking comment.    As part of the merger agreement, WPP said it won't bring back John E. Peters, Thompson's former president and chief operating officer, to a top management position, as it initially planned, nor will it bring back Mr. O'Donnell. According to WPP's arrangement with Mr. Peters, WPP must pay him $1.3 million over three years for not installing him at JWT. Mr. Sorrell said that he has hired Mr. Peters as a consultant to WPP but that he won't be involved in JWT.    Mr. Sorrell left open the question of whether other departed executives will be encouraged to return, including Burton Manning, former chairman and chief executive of Thompson's U.S. unit.    WPP, which had received $530 million in financing from Samuel Montagu andamp; Co. and Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., said it received increased facilities from the two to cover the higher bid. WPP's tender offer expires 12:01 a.m. EDT July 14, and completion of the acquisition is subject to conditions including approval by WPP's holders and receipt of sufficient financing. </TEXT></DOC>
