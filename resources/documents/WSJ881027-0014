The drought in the Farm Belt, smaller increases in exports and in capital spending and a drop in government defense purchases combined to restrain growth in the quarter.    &quot;The report seems to show a clear picture that the economy is slowing,&quot; said Lawrence Chimerine, an economist with WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm. &quot;The central question is: Is it a two or three-month lull, or is it going to continue?&quot;    The slower-than-expected growth sent the dollar lower in the foreign-exchange market, as it reduced expectations of increases in U.S. interest rates.    The gross national product, the value of all goods and services produced in the nation, grew at annual rates of 3% in the second quarter and 3.4% in the first. The 2.2% third-quarter rate was the lowest since a 1.4% rate in the fourth quarter of 1986.    Government policy makers have been hoping the economy will cool off so the nation will be spared an acceleration of inflation, and the Federal Reserve has nudged up interest rates toward that end.    &quot;The growth in the economy has moderated,&quot; Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner said. &quot;Inflation didn't pick up. There is very little reason for {the Fed} to tighten further.&quot;    Even though inflation didn't worsen in the third quarter, prices are still rising at their fastest pace in years. As measured by the GNP price index, prices rose at an annual rate of 4.9% in the third quarter, compared with 5% in the second, 3.5% in the first and an overall increase of 3.6% for 1987. Another inflation measure, the GNP deflator, rose at a 4.4% rate, compared with 5% in the second quarter.    Although third-quarter growth was slower than private forecasters had been predicting, stock and bond markets barely reacted to the news. The dollar, however, fell because the Commerce Department estimated that the U.S. trade deficit worsened in the quarter after three consecutive quarters of improvement. The department said export growth slowed to 8.4%, partly because of falling farm exports, while imports grew 8.7%. But economists at the agency cautioned that these numbers are particularly vulnerable to revisions.    The report didn't dispel all fears of an overheating economy. Francis Schott, economist for Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., said the latest numbers are &quot;a further hint that the economy's growth rate may actually be slowing, but they aren't conclusive.&quot;    For one thing, the reduction in farm output caused by the drought is masking the strength of the rest of the economy. The drought reduced growth by six-tenths of a percentage point in the third quarter and by nine-tenths of a point in the second. The Commerce Department says the drought will cut fourth-quarter GNP by about 1.25 percentage points; most of the crops that were lost would have been harvested in that period. The ending of the drought is expected to boost GNP growth in the first quarter of 1989 by 2.75 percentage points, Mr. Ortner said.    Consumer spending rose at an annual rate of 3.5% in the third quarter, compared with a 3% rate in the second quarter. A surge in demand for electricity produced by the summer heat wave and a sharp increase in clothing sales accounted for about half of the increase.    Business investment grew at a rate of 4.6%, compared with 15.6% in the second quarter, a slowdown that few forecasters had anticipated. Some economists questioned the accuracy of the latest figure.    &quot;We have a lot of clients in the capital-goods sector,&quot; Mr. Chimerine said. &quot;The computer industry is slowing, but orders for all of the other kinds of capital goods are still very strong.&quot;    Business spending on equipment grew at a 5.8% rate, compared with 19.2% in the second quarter. The department said spending on transportation gear fell and growth in the computer business slowed.    Government spending fell at an annual rate of 1.4%, pulled down by the fourth consecutive quarterly decline in defense purchases. Business inventories grew at an annual rate of $33.8 billion, compared with $35.3 billion in the second quarter. Nonfarm inventories were up at a rate of $3.9 billion after shrinking at $21.8 billion in the second quarter.    Final demand in the economy -- which excludes investment in inventories -- grew at a rate of only 2.1% in the third quarter, trailing the rates of 6% in the second quarter and 5.6% in the first.    All the figures are adjusted for inflation and seasonal fluctuations.    Here are some of the major components of the gross national product expressed in seasonally adjusted annual rates in billions of constant (1982) dollars:                                      3rd Qtr.    2nd Qtr.                                        1988        1988    GNP .............................. 4007.3      3985.2      less: inventory chng ...........   33.8        35.3      equals: final sales ............ 3973.5      3949.9    Components of Final Sales      Personal Consumption ........... 2601.3      2579.0      Nonresidential Invest. .......... 495.7       490.2      Residential Invest. ............. 190.2       189.6      Net Exports ..................... -94.9       -92.6      Gov't Purchases ................. 781.1       783.8   In the third quarter, the implicit price deflator was 122.3, compared with 121.0 in the previous quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
