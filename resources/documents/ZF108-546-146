 Now multimedia applications that demand the integration of videowith PC graphics have thrust them into the spotlight.andM;This type of adapter is necessary if you want to display NTSC output from avideodisk player or other video device on a standard VGA monitor.andP;  NTSCsignals are interlaced, which means that they combine two video fields (onecontaining the odd scan lines, the other the even scan lines) to form eachvideo frame; the scan rate is 30 frames per second.andP;  To convert this signalto the noninterlaced, 60-frame-per-second VGA signal, the motion video boardseparates the composite NTSC signal into its red, green, and blue components.andO;Then it combines the first and second fields, displays the frame, combinesthe second and third fields, displays the frame, and so on.andP;  This is the sametechnology used by improved-definition television (IDTV).andM;Motion video overlay boards also come with genlocking circuitry, which letsyou superimpose PC-generated graphics or text on the video images.andP;  To dothis, you specify which color you would like to be transparent; video showsthrough wherever this so-called key color appears in the graphic image.andM;Note that these motion video boards do not actually control videodiskplayers; instead, they respond to commands sent through the PC serial port.andM;A NEW GENERATIONandM;The low profile of the earliest motion video boards, such as Sony's SMI-3081,can be attributed in part to their limited capabilities.andP;  These cardsrestrict video the full screen; while you can create an on-screen window byjudicious use of graphics and key color, you can't shrink the entire videoframe to fit in the window.andP;  Furthermore, you're usually limited to one keycolor, and control over video output extends solely to telling the playerwhich frames to display, as well as how fast and in what direction to playthem.andM;The latest generation of motion video boards offers much more dramaticcapabilities.andP;  Currently, three products fall into this group: VideoLogic'sDVA-4000, New Media Graphics' VideoWindows, and IBM's M-Motion VideoAdapter/A.andP;  With any of these boards, you can place multiple video windowsanywhere on the computer screen, displaying any desired region of the videoframe or shrinking the entire frame to fit.andM;The boards also let you perform special effects such as inverting, copying,and dissolving video into graphics.andP;  You can use multiple key colors (out ofa palette of 256 colors), control the degree of transparency of both thecomputer graphics and the video elements, and vary the hue, saturation, andbrightness of the underlying video image.andP;  You can even digitize still videoimages, eliminating the need for a separate image capture board.andM;In addition to the video capabilities shared by all the boards, the M-MotionVideo Adapter/A also has on-board audio digitizing and playback capabilities.andO;The other two boards merely allow you to control the volume and channel ofthe audio coming from the videodisk player.andM;Of course, increased complexity accompanies this increased sophistication.andO;For the earlier boards, the manufacturer could get away with supplying a fewvideodisk player drivers, a software utility, and some basic commands.andP;  Thenew boards come with full-blown application programming interfaces (APIs)that can be accessed through C function calls.andP;  While the boards are far fromidentical in their internal design, their functions are more or lessequivalent--it's the API that truly differentiates them from one other.andM;IT'S ALL IN THE PROGRAMMINGandM;Of the three, VideoLogic's DVA-4000 is most suited to the current installedbase of ISA-bus PCs running DOS (see First Looks, PC Magazine, February 27,1990, page 33).andP;  The DVA-4000 comes in both MCA- and ISA-bus versions andsupports the widest range of videodisk players.andP;  It's also compatible withIBM's InfoWindow, Sony's View, and Matrox applications, as well as thosewritten for VideoLogic's own IVA series of motion video boards.andP;  Because itsMultimedia Interactive Control (MIC) system API works by setting up a DOSinput/output device, the DVA-4000 works with almost any language orenvironment.andP;  Programs can address the Videologic board much like theyaddress an ordinary serial or parallel port.andM;In contrast, VideoWindows and the M-Motion Video Adapter/A are targeted moreat future environments.andP;  While the VideoWindows board works in ISA-busmachines and its basic API commands can be called by any C program, it istruly best adapted for use with Microsoft Windows or HP NewWave dynamic linklibraries (DLLs).andP;  And while the Micro Channel-only M-Motion Video Adapter/A(which we were unable to obtain by review time) works under DOS, theMultimedia Developers Kit that supports it is a library of C functionsprimarily geared to producing OS/2 Presentation Manager DLLs, though they canbe incorporated into ordinary C programs as well.andM;Because of their superior capabilities and advanced interfaces, these newmotion video boards offer highly practical ways to bring motion video intomultimedia applications as soon as applications support them more widely.andO;They let you duplicate many of the effects of digital video, using proven,cost-effective videodisk technology.andM;M-Motion Video Adapter/A IBM Corp.;
