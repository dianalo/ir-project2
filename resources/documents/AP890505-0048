Each day the Soviet-backed government holds the provincialcapital, the more confident it becomes it can withstand a guerrillasiege and force the insurgents and their Western supporters tonegotiate peace.   For nearly 10 years, the guerrillas _ known as mujahedeen _waged their holy war against the Soviet army, which enteredAfghanistan in 1979 to prop up the Marxist government. The enemywas an invading superpower to them and the battle lines were clear.   But now the Soviets are gone, and the guerrillas have come downfrom the mountains to the rocky plains of Jalalabad. They aretrying to move from hit-and-run attacks to full-scale conventionalwarfare in the largest and bloodiest offensive of the 11-year civilwar.   So far, neither side is winning.   Diplomats in Kabul have said 7,500 to 12,500 insurgents andgovernment soldiers have died or been wounded during the eight-weeksiege. There are no estimates on casualties among Jalalabad'scivilian population, which once numbered about 64,000.   The guerrillas have pounded the eastern city with as many as16,000 rockets a day. The forces of President Najib have respondedwith long-range Scud missiles and have dispatched MiG-21 and MiG-27jets to pound guerrilla camps.   Jalalabad and its magnificent gardens and palaces has beenvirtually destroyed. Refugees are fleeing the carnage by foot andon flatbed trucks.   The mujahedeen are fighting as fiercely as ever, but with littlecoordination or military discipline.   Seven guerrilla factions set up a government-in-exile inPakistan in February but still do not have a cohesive ideology orconsistent popular support.   Meanwhile, government forces have proved they can fighteffectively without Soviet troops to back them up. The soldiers aredriven in part by fear of death or torture if captured by theinsurgents.   When the Soviet army rolled into Afghanistan in December 1979,the United States took advantage of Pakistan's relationship withguerrillas who had taken refuge there.   Washington sent weapons to Pakistan's military intelligenceservice. The Pakistanis delivered them to the guerrilla leaders,who handed them out to their field commanders.   But the arrangements created rivalries among the insurgents andundermined efforts to unite the resistance.   ``Until Jalalabad, few in the West listened to complaints aboutthe resistance. While the Soviets were in Afghanistan, it didn'tmatter. Now it does,'' said one diplomat with ties to both sides.   When the U.N.-sponsored accord calling for the Soviet withdrawalwas signed last year, the lack of a coherent guerrillagovernment-in-exile became a prime concern, and it was left toPakistani generals to shape one.   The Soviets completed their withdrawal on Feb. 15, and thePakistani military began pushing the mujahedeen to attack Jalalabadso they would have a place to set up their government.   Diplomats in Kabul say the siege was orchestrated primarily byPakistan's military and based on the theory that the city wouldfall quickly and pave the way for the final push on Kabul, thecapital.   Several insurgent leaders boasted that Jalalabad would be theirswithin a day. But their predictions proved wrong and theirself-imposed deadline was pushed back to weeks, then finally months.   Some observers say it is time the United States changedstrategies if it wants to lead in negotiating peace.   ``If the mujahedeen and the Kabul government reach a compromisewith Washington's help, it will be a credit for the UnitedStates,'' said another diplomat who also spoke on condition ofanonymity.   ``But if the Americans work through Pakistan, their policy willfail. The Afghans and the Pakistanis have been enemies for a longtime. The Pakistanis will just push on to fight, and the Afghannation will be finished. If that happens, the United States willlose all the credit it has earned.''</TEXT></DOC>
