Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., met with theunion leaders over the weekend, said the sources, who spoke oncondition of anonymity. The talks broke down mainly because Icahnwas seeking wage concessions from the Eastern unions that the unionleaders considered too severe, the sources told The AssociatedPress.   In addition, a source close to Eastern said no further meetingsbetween Icahn and the unions had been scheduled.   According to a report in Monday's editions of the New YorkTimes, Icahn planned to meet _ possibly Monday _ with FrankLorenzo, the chairman of Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent. Lorenzohas said publicly that Icahn recently approached him about apossible bid for Miami-based Eastern.   Lorenzo has given Icahn an exclusive right until the end of theweek to make an offer for Eastern to the Texas Air board ofdirectors, the Times said, quoting unnamed sources.
