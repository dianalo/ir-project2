The unit of Englewood, Colo.-based U.S. West Inc. ordered1,500 of the machines, Tektronix said. Although terms weren'tdisclosed, analysts considered the order to be a lift for theailing electronic equipment and measurement instrumentsmaker, which had a 1990 net loss of $92.6 million.</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, the order shows growing interest in X terminalsamong increasingly cost-conscious computer purchasers. Theterminals are more sophisticated versions of the old &quot;dumb&quot;terminals of the 1960s, which had to be linked to mainframecomputers in order to operate. The machines had been losingfavor amid falling prices and growing value of personalcomputers and workstations.   Recently, however, manufacturers of the machines have beenadding new features, and some units are independently capableof producing graphics and certain other functions. Moreover,while operating from a small base, the X terminal market isgrowing faster than the workstation and PC market, with 1990sales of 69,000 units, compared with 15,000 units in 1989,according to Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif., market researchfirm.   &quot;You've got a cheaper terminal than a workstation, whichto some degree emulates it in that you can take informationas fast and store it back without the cost of a workstation,&quot;said John M. Geraghty, an analyst with First Boston Corp.Prices range between $3,000 and $4,000, compared with $5,000and up to $20,000 for workstations.   Currently, Network Computing Devices, a closely heldMountain View, Calif., computer maker, controls about 33% ofthe X windows market. International Business Machines Corp.,Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. are alsocompetitive in the field. Tektronix controls about 6% of themarket, Dataquest said.   U.S. West said its service representatives will use theterminals to handle customer-service calls across its14-state service area. &quot;It signifies a break from previouspurchasing practices,&quot; said Rex A. Humston, director ofinformation technologies for U.S. West Communications. Forcertain work environments, X terminals will be chosen in thefuture, he explained.   &quot;We decided to find out where the industry was going, andfind an open system that would allow us a standardenvironment for a graphical user interface,&quot; Mr. Humstonadded.   Tektronix's stock closed at $22.875 yesterday, up 50 centsin composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
