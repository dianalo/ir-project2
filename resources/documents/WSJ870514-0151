Both men toured Nicaragua for three weeks, Mr. Rushdie as a guest of the ruling FSLN. Their books -- Mr. Rushdies's &quot;The Jaguar Smile: A Nicaraguan Journey&quot; (Viking, 170 pages, $12.95) and Mr. Davis's &quot;Where Is Nicaragua?&quot; (Simon andamp; Schuster, 347 pages, $18.95) -- reveal little about Nicaragua, and much about their authors' roles as modern-day political pilgrims.    Much of Mr. Rushdie's book reads like a paean to the Sandinista &quot;comandantes,&quot; whom he finds to be &quot;men of integrity and great pragmatism, with an astonishing lack of bitterness towards their opponents.&quot; Mr. Rushdie has only sympathy for Daniel Ortega's bitterness at being condemned for buying those famous designer eyeglasses in New York. After all, Mr. Ortega's spouse, Rosario Murillo, explains, they were a gift from a wealthy American friend, and &quot;we cannot get such things here, but still.&quot;    Typically, Mr. Rushdie does not check back to find that the Ortegas paid for them with an Embassy Diner's Club Card, and that they spent more for the purchase than they received in a check for medical supplies from their devoted friends at the Ethical Culture Society.    As a writer, of course, Mr. Rushdie is opposed to censorship, and he is saddened when a Sandinista editor at the official FSLN paper tells him freedom of the press is merely &quot;cosmetic.&quot; Mr. Rushdie partakes in a &quot;silent argument&quot; with himself and concludes that the &quot;flaws of censorship&quot; are not sufficient reason to overthrow a decent and good revolution.    Like Mr. Rushdie, Peter Davis went to Nicaragua for a scant three weeks in 1983, on assignment for The Nation magazine. He returned to update his material for a shorter period in 1986. Mr. Davis does not seem to understand he traveled in a context contrived by the Sandinistas.    Thus Mr. Davis visits the powerful minister of the interior, Tomas Borge, who repeats the story of how he captured and then freed the very &quot;guardia&quot; who had tortured him before the revolution. This well-worn saga is meant to show both Mr. Borge's mercy and the humane values of the revolution. The same heroic tale also appears in Mr. Rushdie's book. Somehow neither author managed to discover, or at least didn't mention, all those Nicaraguans tortured by Mr. Borge's own ministry.    When Mr. Davis seeks to find out how the revolution treats workers, he is taken to the leader of the official Sandinista trade union. The national secretary of the CST is described as &quot;modest, teacherly, patient.&quot; Mr. Davis does not seem to know that the Sandinista union is acting as a company union, using its power to force workers into its ranks and to accede to the demands of the state, which include a ban on strikes. Mr. Davis does not see fit to go to the headquarters of the old, militant trade unions, whose leaders have been harassed, arrested and beaten up by goons working for the patient national secretary.    Nor did Mr. Davis try to visit any of the &quot;campesinos&quot; who are becoming a solid social base in support of the Contras, or even ask why so many former Sandinistas have defected and become supporters of those who are often said to have been Somocistas. He does not let his readers know that after the state of emergency was declared in 1985, six of the major opposition parties, from Communist to Social Christian, asked for amnesty for the rebels and immediate negotiations with them, suggesting the path of reconciliation and democratization as the only practical way out of continual warfare. In response, Managua made it a criminal offense to call the continuing conflict with the Contras a &quot;civil war.&quot; When he discusses the opposition parties, he suggests that they are as anti-Contra as the government.    At least, Mr. Davis does raise the censorship issue in his interview with Daniel Ortega. But Mr. Ortega assures him that freedom is &quot;not for the individual,&quot; and that &quot;your freedom, sir, is a monster.&quot; In his own words, Peter Davis agrees: &quot;The other freedoms Americans prize had never had a place in Nicaraguan life anyway. Foremost among these is freedom of expression.&quot;    At the core of his discussion, Mr. Davis asks: &quot;What kind of a revolution can an impoverished and oppressed society hope to have that the United States will find desirable and supportable?&quot; He might have asked a different question more profitably: What kind of revolution might Nicaragua have had, had the self-proclaimed vanguard not used its armed might to impose its private agenda on a once popular and broad-based revolution? Mr. Davis's failure to ask that question is the fallacy of his entire quest. Mr. Rushdie is an unabashed apologist. But it is finally Peter Davis who serves the Sandinistas' propaganda goals far more effectively.    ---   Mr. Radosh writes frequently about Latin America. </TEXT></DOC>
