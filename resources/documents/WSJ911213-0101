Withonly six nays and seven abstentions, it approved BorisYeltsin's new creation, the Commonwealth of IndependentStates (CIS). Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to hold the uniontogether had failed and his future is in doubt. As he put it,he might not have a &quot;role in the new structure.&quot;   Yesterday's lopsided 188-6 vote attests to the politicalskill of Boris Yeltsin, who received what the AP described as&quot;thunderous applause&quot; when he told the Parliament, &quot;Icongratulate you on this historic decision and thank you]&quot;</LP><TEXT>   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker couldn't overcome yetmore hand-wringing, but at least said that the scale ofopportunity now matches the &quot;danger&quot; he and other highadministration officials have seen in the Soviet collapse. Itis not clear exactly what the Bush administration wanted tohappen, other than Mikhail Gorbachev's escaping retirement.But whatever it was, it didn't stop Mr. Yeltsin fromreplacing the collapsed union with a system that certainlyhas far better prospects than anything Mr. Gorbachev mighthave salvaged.   Mr. Yeltsin had the political wisdom to accept populardemands for independence in the non-Russian republics andconceive of a system of confederation that would accommodatethose demands. Mr. Gorbachev, so often rated in the West as aconsummate politician but a man who seldom was in touch withthe people, went the opposite way, blustering about howdissolution of the union would bring chaos and tragedy. Whythe Bush administration saw fit to echo that theme is amystery to us unless it simply had to do with George Bush'spersonal affection for Mr. Gorbachev.   Yesterday, Mr. Gorbachev in effect conceded that histactic had not worked, as he acknowledged that with theRussian vote a &quot;new structure&quot; had become fact. In hisefforts to block Mr. Yeltsin, he hadn't even been able tomuster a quorum in the Soviet legislature, its membersobviously having decided that it had become moribund.   Mr. Yeltsin's handling of the decline and fall of theSoviet empire hardly suggests the &quot;chaos&quot; that Washington'shigh officials warn about so constantly. He early on severedhimself from the failing Communist Party and won a popularelection to the Russian presidency, thereby gaining moralauthority over Mr. Gorbachev, who had never tested hispopularity with the people. After that, months ago, Mr.Yeltsin began giving support to republican movements,starting with the Baltic States, and began making allianceswith republican leaders, most importantly in Ukraine.   When the dominoes began to fall in earnest withoverwhelming votes for independence in even the largestnon-Russian republics, it was clear that Mr. Gorbachev's&quot;union&quot; treaty would fail. After the biggest domino, Ukraine,toppled with a 90%-plus vote for independence two weeks ago,Mr. Yeltsin stepped in and forged his Slavic commonwealthwith Ukraine and Byelorussia. Yesterday, he was able to gobefore the Parliament with the news that two other republics,Kirghizia and Armenia, might join and that Kazakhstan,Turkmenistan and Tadzhikistan were considering it as well. Hehad called top Russian generals together for a meeting tobring them on board. It is doubtful that any great empire hasever had such a smooth transition to commonwealth status.   Mr. Gorbachev suggested to journalists yesterday thatperhaps his role in Russian history has ended. If so, historywill reflect well on him, because it was he who had the goodsense to open up the old Soviet system and let it begin thepolitical transformation that yesterday achieved a new sourceof stability.   Certainly, the commonwealth republics face many seriousproblems as they try to create a new non-communist order thatwill allow private enterprise and private markets toflourish. They will need all the advice they can get frompractitioners of modern Western capitalism and banking andfrom jurists who properly understand the rule of law, as aservant of the people, not the state.   But we would be more encouraged about the quality of thatadvice had we not read on the news wires, in connection withplanned humanitarian aid, yet another reference by Mr. Bakerto the &quot;Soviet peoples.&quot; There are no more &quot;Soviet peoples.&quot;With yesterday's vote in Moscow, the old order is dead. Thesooner Washington figures that out, the better able it willbe to provide some real help.</TEXT></DOC>
