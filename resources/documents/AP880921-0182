Michel Aoun,said.   President Amin Gemayel's six-year term expires on Friday, andParliament is scheduled to meet Thursday to elect his successor.The Constitution prevents Gemayel from running again.   But lawmakers are deeply divided over several candidates, andthe last time they scheduled a vote, not enough lawmakers showed upto form a quorum.   The impasse has threatened to reignite Lebanon's civil war,which has claimed 130,000 lives since 1975.   The army is considered stronger than the various warringChristian and Moslem militias and is believed capable ofcontrolling them if it had the political mandate to do so.   In Washington, White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk saidPresident Reagan sent a telegram to Cardinal John O'Connor of NewYork saying the U.S. government ``attaches great importance to apeaceful and constitutional presidential election in Lebanon onSept 22.''   ``We remain strongly committed to helping restore Lebaneseunity, sovreignty and territorial integrity,'' Reagan said in thetelegram, sent in response to one by O'Connor urging Reagan supportLebanon ``at this extremely critical moment.''   Twenty-seven Christian parliamentarians said Wednesday they willboycott Thursday's election unless the session is shifted fromMoslem west Beirut to the no-man's land at the city's dividingGreen Line.   ``We shall not go to the Moslem side. There will be no sessiontomorrow unless the venue is changed,'' said deputy Emile RouhanaSaqr.   The boycott again would prevent the 51-member quorum that the76-seat Parliament needs to hold the election.   Lebanon's main Christian militia, the right-wing LebaneseForces, are backing veteran politician Raymond Edde for president.   Edde, a Maronite Catholic, is an outspoken critic of foreignintervention in Lebanon. He says he will seek to force Israel fromits self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon within 20days if he is elected.   Edde has been living in self-imposed exile in Paris sincefleeing Lebanon after three assassination attempts in 1976.   Two other Maronite Catholic candidates, former PresidentSuleiman Franjieh and Parliament deputy Mikhail Daher, have Syria'sbacking. Syria, a supporter of Lebanon's Moslem and leftistfactions, has 40,000 troops in eastern and northern provinces ofthe country as well as Beirut's Moslem sector.   The Christians charge that Franjieh, president from 1970 to 1976and a close friend of President Hafez Assad of Syria, will makeLebanon a Syrian satellite.   Christian deputies boycotted the Aug. 18 presidential vote inParliament to prevent a quorum when Franjieh was the only seriouscandidate.   Lebanese sources said Franjieh was likely to withdraw hiscandidacy in favor of Daher, who was selected this week as acompromise candidate by U.S. envoy Richard Murphy and Syrianleaders.   The Christians have wielded political power since independencefrom France in 1943, when they were considered to be the majority.Moslems now comprise an estimated 55 percent of Lebanon's 4 millionpopulation.   According to an unwritten national covenant dating to Lebanon'sindependence from France in 1943, the president should be aMaronite, the house speaker a Shiite Moslem and the prime ministera Sunni Moslem.   If Parliament fails to elect a president Thursday, Gemayel wasexpected to form a caretaker Cabinet, which could formalize the defacto partition of Lebanon into sectarian areas.   Syria's Moslem and leftist allies charge that Gemayel would namea Maronite prime minister and have threatened to respond bydeclaring their own republic in territory they control.   Gemayel met in Damascus with Assad and Lebanese Christianleaders. Afterward, presidential spokesman Jibrane Kourieh said,``An agreement for saving Lebanon has been reached between the twopresidents.'' He gave no further details except to say the Lebaneseelection will be held.</TEXT></DOC>
