In its suit filed in New York Supreme Court, Asarco said itsinterest in a joint venture with Freeport-McMoran could be violatedby the sale. New York-based Asarco said it is asking the judge tohalt completion of the sale until Asarco's interests have beenfully protected.   Minorco's tender offer for Freeport-McMoran expires March 23.   Asarco and Freeport-McMoran each have a 50 percent interest inthe Santa Cruz copper mining research project near Casa Grande,Ariz. The federal government is funding 75 percent of the project,which is designed to test a method of extracting copper from a deepunderground formation.   Freeport-McMoran said Asarco's suit is without merit and will bevigorously contested.   On Feb. 20, Freeport-McMoran announced the sale ofFreeport-McMoran Gold Co. to Minorco, which is controlled by DeBeers Consolidated Mines Ltd. of South Africa and the associatedAnglo American Corp. Proceeds from the sale would be used todevelop a sulfur discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, the company said.   Minorco failed last year in a hostile takeover bid forConsolidated Gold Fields PLC, a British mining company.   The proposed sale of Freeport-McMoran Gold is part of afar-reaching asset sale by its parent, New Orleans-basedFreeport-McMoran. The parent is ridding itself of operationspurchased in the 1980s to pay off debt and to focus the company onphosphate fertilizers, metals and Gulf of Mexico oil and naturalgas.</TEXT></DOC>
