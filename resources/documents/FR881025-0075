The following summary also contains a list of submissions thatwere dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appeal</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>William A. Hewgley, 9/27/88, KFA-0213</T3>William A. Hewgley filed an Appeal from a partial denial by the Officeof the Inspector General (IG) of a Request for Information which Mr. Hewgleyhad submitted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In consideringthe Appeal, the Department of Energy (DOE) found that the name of a personallegedly contacted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) through Mr.Hewgley was exempt from mandatory disclosure pursuant to Exemption 6 ofthe FOIA. The DOE also found that the name of an IG employee who key punchedmaterial into a computer retrieval system was not exempt from disclosureunder the FOIA. Important issues considered in the Decision and Order were:(i) The public interest in disclosure of the name of an individual whowas allegedly contacted by the CIA versus that person's privacy interestin keeping such contacts secret, (ii) the substantial public interest inrelease of names of governmental employees performing ministerial tasksabsent an important government interest, and (iii) the propriety of referringdocuments in DOE files to their originating federal agency for a FOIA determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Remedial Orders</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Cities Service Oil and Gas Corp., 9/30/88, HRO-0285</T3>Cities Service Oil and Gas Corporation (Cities) objected to a ProposedRemedial Order (PRO) that the DOE's Economic Regulatory Administrationissued to the firm on March 25, 1985. In the PRO, the DOE found that Citiesreceived consideration in 91 sales of price-controlled crude oil in excessof that permitted by 10 CFR 212.183(b). After considering the firm's objections,the DOE found that Cities used the artifice of matching purchase and salecontracts to disguise the excess consideration, which took the form ofa discount in Cities' reciprocal purchase of exempt oil. The DOE rejectedthe firm's contention that its transactions fell within the ``exchangeexemption,'' 10 CFR 212.182. The DOE found that the exchange exemptiondid not apply because Cities' payment for the exempt crude oil did notreflect the value of that oil and because Cities' reciprocal transactionsdid not serve any of the historical and legitimate purposes of exchangewhich were to redistribute crude oil inventory with respect to quality,location, or time. Accordingly, the DOE issued a Remedial Order which requiresCities to refund $263.9 million plus interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Phoenix Petroleum Co., Steven B. Wyatt, 9/29/88, KRO-0190</T3>Phoenix Petroleum Company and Steven B. Wyatt objected to a Proposed RemedialOrder that was issued to them on September 12, 1985. In the PRO, the EconomicRegulatory Administration found that Phoenix's crude oil reselling activitieshad violated the layering rule, 10 CFR 212.186, which prohibited crudeoil resellers from applying a markup in any crude oil sales transactionin which they did not perform any historical and traditional crude oilreselling function.In considering the objections, the DOE found that Phoenix's domestic crudeoil resales violated the layering rule. The DOE rejected the argument thatit lacked jurisdiction over Phoenix's transactions because they were allegedto be crude oil futures contracts. Moreover, the DOE found that even ifPhoenix's transactions could be considered to be futures contracts, thatwould not deprive the DOE of jurisdiction over them. The DOE, however,agreed with the respondents that it did not have jurisdiction over twoforeign sales of crude oil where there was no evidence that the crude oilever entered the United States. In addition, the DOE determined that theovercharges alleged for January 1981 should be reduced to account for aportion of Phoenix's sales that may have taken place after crude oil wasdecontrolled on January 28. The DOE also held that the ERA had not convincinglymatched Phoenix's purchases and sales. Under these circumstances, the DOEcalculated Phoenix's refund liability to be the amount of the firm's grossprofits from layered transactions.Finally, the DOE found that Wyatt should be held personally liable fora portion of Phoenix's refund liability, because he was the person primarilyresponsible for negotiating the transactions in question and because hebenefited substantially from the violations. The DOE determined, however,that on equitable grounds, he should not be held jointly and severallyliable for Phoenix's entire refund liability, but his liability shouldbe limited to the amount that he benefited from Phoenix's activities. Thisdetermination was based upon the fact that he was a junior officer andnot an owner of Phoenix, and on the fact that he received only a smallfraction of Phoenix's gross profits from the violations. As so modified,the PRO was issued as a final Order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Refund Applications</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Clarence J. Stallmann, 9/27/88, RF272-12616</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a refund from crude oil overchargefunds to Clarence J. Stallmann based on his purchases of refined petroleumproducts during the period August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981. Stallmannused the products for various agricultural activities and determined hisclaim by estimating his consumption based on the total acres he farmedmultiplied by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) 23.8 gallonsper acre average farm consumption figure. However, to this total Stallmannadded gallonage estimates of propane used to dry corn and of motor oiland grease purchased for tractor use. Since the USDA estimate includesproducts utilized for tractor use and drying corn, the DOE denied the additionalgallons, and approved the total based upon the USDA average farm consumptionfigure. As an end-user of petroleum products, the applicant was presumedto have been injured as a result of the crude oil overcharges. The refundgranted was $8.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Exxon Corporation/ W.F. Parker Oil Company, Inc., Kilgore Oil Company,9/30/88, RF307-1504, RF307-1566</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning Applications for Refundfiled by W.F. Parker Oil Company, Inc. (Parker) and Kilgore Oil Company(Kilgore) in the Exxon Corporation special refund proceeding. Each firmpurchased directly from Exxon and was a reseller of Exxon products. Eachfirm's allocable share exceeded $5,000. Instead of making an injury showingto receive its full allocable share, Parker and Kilgore each chose to electthe $5,000 threshold. Therefore, each firm was granted a refund of $5,647(5,000 principal plus $647 interest).<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Exxon Corporation/ Woodfield Fish andamp; Oyster Company et al., 9/28/88,RF307-71 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning Applications for Refundfiled in the Exxon Corporation special refund proceeding.

Supreme submitted documentation substantiatingthat during the consent order period it maintained banks of unrecoveredincreased product costs. Supreme also submitted purchase cost data formotor gasoline and middle distillates for the relevant period. Using thecompetitive disadvantage methodology, the DOE determined that Supreme'srefund should be limited to the gallons of motor gasoline and middle distillatesthat the firm purchased at above market prices. The total refund approvedin this Decision is $22,153, representing $10,797 in principal and $11,356in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Gulf Oil Company/CEE Ell Enterprises, et al., 9/27/88, RF300-1155 etal.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning 10 Applications for Refundfiled in the Gulf Oil Corporation special refund proceeding.

Sandhill claimed an additionalrefund of $3,374 based upon the loss of a ``prompt payment'' discount Huskydiscontinued during a portion of the consent order period. With respectto the above-volumetric refund claim, Sandhill failed to demonstrate thatit did not increase its prices to compensate for the loss of the discount.Without this information, the DOE could not determine that Sandhill wasinjured by the lost discount. However, the DOE determined that Sandhillshould be granted a refund on a volumetric basis, since its claim was lessthan the $5,000 small claims threshold level established in <T3>Husky Oil Co., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85.045 (1985).
