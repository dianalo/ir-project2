Executive Summary</ITAG>A. The ProposalsOn June 2, 1988 the Commission issued a release proposing amendments toExchange Act Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10, which set forth reporting requirementsapplicable when an issuer changes its fiscal year end.\19\<NOTE/> The proposals were designed to update the rules, integratethem with other current periodic reporting requirements, codify staff ruleinterpretations, and clarify issuers' quarterly reporting obligations inchange of fiscal year circumstances. The Commission also proposed a newitem to Form 8-K to require reporting of a change in fiscal year and anew Investment Company Act rule to govern the reporting requirements forinvestment companies that change their fiscal year end. In addition, tocodify staff practices, amendments were proposed to the proxy and accountingrules regarding financial reporting. Proposals also were made to amendthe quarterly reporting rules to eliminate a reporting gap by modifyingthe period for which a new registrant's first quarter report must be filed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ Release No. 33-6778 (June 2, 1988) (53 FR 21670) (``ProposingRelease''). Attention is directed to the Proposing Release for a detaileddiscussion of the proposals and their objectives.A majority of the commentators on the Proposing Release were accountingfirms and an accounting association.\20\<NOTE/> All but one of the commentators expressed general supportfor the proposals, in whole or in part.\21\<NOTE/> While commentators generally approved of the revision ofissuers' reporting obligations in change of fiscal year circumstances,or codification of staff practices, most also had suggestions on specificaspects of the proposals. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ The nine comment letters received are available for publicinspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Room (FileNo. S7-8-88). The commentators included five accounting firms, one accountingassociation, one bar association, one law firm, and one public utilityholding company. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ The other commentator made recommendations on specificparts of the proposals but expressed neither general support nor oppositionto the proposals.   The Commission is adopting the amendments substantially as proposed. Thechanges from the proposals are mainly in response to commentators' suggestions.All substantive changes from the proposals are noted and explained in thedetailed discussion of the amendments in Part II below.B. The Amendments Prior to the amendments, Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 required an issuer changingits fiscal year end to file an ``interim report'' with the Commission containingfinancial and other information about the ``interim period'' from the endof the most recently concluded fiscal year to the opening date of the newfiscal year if that period covered three or more months. Such reports wererequired to be filed on the form used for the issuer's annual report. To avoid confusion with other reports, such as quarterly reports, whichcommonly are referred to as interim reports, under the amendments, interimreports are referred to as ``transition reports'' and interim periods called``transition periods.'' The amendments also include the following substantiverevisions:<ITAG tagnum="81">(1) Transition Reporting on Forms 10-Q and 10-K </ITAG>Separate transition reports are required for all transition periods, exceptthose of one month or less, Issuers will continue to file a transitionreport on the annual reporting form, usually Form 10-K, including auditedfinancial statements, for transition periods of six or more months. Fora transition period shorter than six months, issuers are given an optionto file a transition report on either Form 10-Q, including unaudited financialstatements, or Form 10-K, including audited financial statements. Informationfor a transition period of one month or less may be included in the issuer'sreport on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of the newly adopted fiscal yearthat ends after the date on which the issuer determined to change its fiscalyear, if separate audited statements of income and cash flows coveringthe transition period are filed with the first annual report for the newlyadopted fiscal year. If the issuer's next report is the first annual reportfor the newly adopted fiscal year, instead of a quarterly report, a transitionperiod of one month or less may be covered in that annual report.<ITAG tagnum="81">(2) Conforming the Filing Requirements of Transition Reports to theCurrent Requirements for Forms 10-Q and 10-K </ITAG>To conform to the current filing periods for reports on Forms 10-K and10-Q, the filing period for transition reports on Form 10-K is 90 daysafter the close of the transition period or the date of the determinationto change the fiscal year, whichever is later, and for transition reportson Form 10-Q 45 days after the later of these two events.<ITAG tagnum="81">(3) Codification of Staff Rule Interpretations of the Quarterly ReportingRequirements When an Issuer Changes Its Fiscal Year End </ITAG>Consistent with staff practice, issuers will continue to have the optionof filing quarterly reports for the transition period on the basis of eitherthe old or new fiscal year. Also, consistent with staff rule interpretations,issuers, in most cases, will continue to be required to file a quarterlyreport for any quarter of the old fiscal year that ended before the dateof the issuer's determination to change its year end. The amendments specifythat the requirement to file quarterly reports on the new basis beginswith the first quarter in the new fiscal year that ends after the issuerdetermined to change its year end.<ITAG tagnum="81">(4) Clarification of Transition Reporting for Successor Issuers </ITAG>Amendments to Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 require transition reporting forall successor issuers, but only where they have a different fiscal yearend from that of the predecessor. Successor issuers are required to filea transition report concerning the predecessor for any transition periodbetween the close of the fiscal year covered by the last annual reportof the predecessor and the date of succession. For a transition periodof six or more months, the successor issuer must file the transition reporton Form 10-K, including audited financial statements. For a transitionperiod of less than six months, the successor issuer may opt instead tofile the transition report on Form 10-Q, including unaudited financialstatements. Just as for changes in fiscal year, where the transition periodis one month or less, the successor issuer need not file a separate transitionreport, provided that the required information for the transition periodis contained in a subsequent quarterly report, or if the next report isan annual report, in that annual report.<ITAG tagnum="81">(5) </ITAG>Separate Transition Reporting Rules for Foreign PrivateIssuersSeparate provisions require a foreign private issuer with a transitionperiod longer than six months to file a Form 20-F containing responsesto all items required when the Form is used as an annual report, and includingaudited financial statements. For a transition period of six or fewer months,a foreign private issuer may opt instead to file a transition report onForm 20-F that includes responses to only a limited number of specifieditems and unaudited financial statements. Where the transition period isone month or less, a foreign private issuer is not required to file a separatetransition report if the first annual report for the newly adopted fiscalyear covers the transition period as well as the fiscal year.<ITAG tagnum="81">(6) </ITAG>Reporting a Change in Fiscal Year on Form 8-KNew Item 8 of Form 8-K requires an issuer to report its new fiscal yearend, the Form (10-K or 10-Q) on which the report covering the transitionperiod will be filed, and the date of the determination to change its fiscalyear end. The Form 8-K must be filed within 15 days after that date.<ITAG tagnum="81">(7) </ITAG>Specific Provisions Regarding Filing Fees and Extensionsof TimeNo filing fee is required for transition reports. Amended Rule 12b-25 andamended Form 12b-25 add transition reports to those reports for which anextension of time for filing is available.<ITAG tagnum="81">(8) </ITAG>Separate Rule for Transition Reporting of Investment CompaniesNew Investment Company Act Rule 30b1-3 provides transition reporting requirementsspecifically tailored to the semi-annual and annual reporting obligationsof investment companies. The new Rule codifies the staff practice of requiringinvestment companies that change their fiscal year end to file a reporton Form N-SAR within 60 days of either the close of the resulting transitionperiod or the date of the determination to change the fiscal year end,whichever is later.<ITAG tagnum="81">(9) </ITAG>Codification of Staff Practice of Permitting Reliance onNine Months StatementsNew accounting Rule 3-06 and a parallel note to Rule 14a-3(b)(1) \2\\2\<NOTE/> of the proxy rules codify the staff practice of accepting,under specified circumstances such as a change in fiscal year, financialstatements covering a 9 to 12 month period in satisfaction of a requirementfor financial statements for either one year or one year of a multipleyear period.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ 17 CFR 240.14a-3(b)(1).<ITAG tagnum="81">(10) </ITAG>Codification of Staff Practice on Age of Audited FinancialStatements in A<T3> First-Time Registrant's Registration Statement</T3>To assure that timely financial statements for first-time registrants areavailable, amended accounting Rule 3-12 codifies the staff practice ofrequiring that the most recent audited financial statements in a registrationstatement under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') \2\\3\<NOTE/> or on Form 10 \2\\4\<NOTE/> filed by a non-reporting company be no more than 1 year and45 days old.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ 15 U.S.C. 77a <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ 17 CFR 249.210.<ITAG tagnum="81">(11) </ITAG>Period to be Covered by First Report on Form 10-Q for First-TimeRegistrantsTo avoid reporting gaps, amended Rules 13a-13 and 15d-13 governing quarterlyreporting require a new registrant to file its first report on Form 10-Qfor the first fiscal quarter following the most recent fiscal year or fullquarter for which financial statements were included in its registrationstatement.Examples illustrating the application of the amendments to typical reportingsituations are contained in the Appendix in Part V of this Release. Theexamples have been modified where appropriate to reflect changes from theproposals.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion</ITAG>A. Reporting Fiscal Year Changes<ITAG tagnum="81">1. </ITAG>Transition Reporting on Forms 10-Q and 10-KThe Commission is adopting amendments to Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 \2\\5\<NOTE/> requiring an issuer to file separate transition reports forall transition periods, except those of one month or less. Under the priorrules, a separate transition report was not required for a transition periodshorter than three months. In the Proposing Release, the Commission solicitedcomment on a proposed requirement of separate transition reports for alltransition periods, including transition periods shorter than three months.Three commentators criticized the proposed requirement as not useful, necessaryor justified by the costs, and recommended that information on such shortertransition periods be included in the issuer's next report on Form 10-Q.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ Rule 13A-10 applies to issuers with securities registeredpursuant to section 12 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78<T3>1</T3>). Rule 15d-10 applies to issuers with securities registeredunder the Securities Act and filing Exchange Act reports pursuant to section15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 88o(d)).The Commission has decided not to require a separate transition reportfor transition periods of one month or less. Where the transition periodis one month or less, the Commission believes that the cost associatedwith filing a separate report for such a short time span outweigh the limitedbenefit of such reports to investors.\2\\6\<NOTE/> The amendments instead permit information about a transitionperiod of one month or less to be included in the issuer's report on Form10-Q for the first quarter of the newly adopted fiscal year that ends afterthe date on which the determination was made to change the fiscal year.\2\\7\<NOTE/> If the issuer's next report is the first annual report forthe newly adopted fiscal year, the transition period may be covered inthat annual report.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ A change from a fiscal year ending as of the last dayof the month to a 52-53 week fiscal year commencing within seven days ofthe month end (or from a 52-53 week to a month end) is not deemed a changein fiscal year for purposes of reporting subject to Rule 13a-10 or 15d-10if the new fiscal year commences with the end of the old fiscal year. Insuch cases, a transition report would not be required. Either the old ornew fiscal year could, therefore, be as short as 359 days, or as long as371 days (372 is a leap year).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ <T3>See </T3>Part II.A.4., <T3>infra, </T3>amended Rules 13a-10(d) and 15d-10(d), and Appendix Examples1.a. andamp; 1.e.Separate transition reports are required for all transition periods longerthan one month. As the transition period becomes longer, the investor'sinterest in the prompt disclosure of financial information about the transitionperiod increases. The Commission believes that requiring transition reportsfor all transition periods longer than one month strikes the appropriatebalance between the investment community's need for disclosure and thedesire of issuers to minimize the costs of compliance.Under the amendments, as under the prior rules, use of Form 10-K will continueto be required for transition reports for transition periods of six ormore months.\28\<NOTE/> For transition periods shorter than six months, amended Rules13a-10 and 15d-10 give issuers the option to file transition reports oneither Form 10-Q, including unaudited financial statements, or Form 10-K,including audited financial statements.\29\<NOTE/> All information requested in the textual items of the reportingforms, as well as the required financial information, must be provided.Technical changes are being adopted, as proposed, to make the descriptionsand cover sheets of and General Instructions to Forms 10-K and 10-Q consistentwith the amendments. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>See </T3>amended Rules 13a-10(b) and 15d-10(b) and Appendix Examples1.d., 1.g., andamp; 1.h. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ <T3>See </T3>amended Rules 13a-10(c) and 15d-10(c) and Appendix Examples1.b., 1.c., andamp; 1.f. In the Proposing Release, comment was invited on the six month cutoff.The three commentators addressing the six month cutoff favored it.\30\<NOTE/> While the proposals would have required use of Form 10-Qfor transition periods shorter than six months, two commentators favoredaffording issuers an option to file on either Form 10-Q or Form 10-K forsuch shorter transition periods so that issuers could furnish audited financialstatements in the first instance. The Commission has adopted this suggestedoption, enabling issuers that opt to use Form 10-K to avoid the possibilityof later revisions of previously published unaudited financial statementsfor the transition period. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ With a six month cutoff, the amendments allow 17 monthsbetween filing audited financial statements in the case where an issuerchanges its fiscal year end with a resulting transition period of fivemonths. For example, an issuer with a December 31 year end that changesits fiscal year in 1990 to May 31, 1990 will be permitted to file a Form10-Q, including unaudited financial statements, covering the transitionperiod from January 1, 1990 through May 31, 1990. The issuer will not berequired to file audited financial statements until August 29, 1991, thedue date for its next annual report covering the newly adopted fiscal yearfrom June 1, 1990 through May 31, 1991. Compliance with the requirementsfor financial statements under the transition reporting rules will be deemedto satisfy the updating obligations under section 10(a)(3) of the SecuritiesAct [15 U.S.C. 77j(a)(3)]. Because the amendments afford issuers the option to use Form 10-K or 10-Q,the Commission has added a requirement, not contained in the proposals,that an issuer state in its Form 8-K reporting the change in fiscal yearthe Form (Form 10-Q or 10-K) on which the report covering the transitionperiod will be filed.\31\<NOTE/> This requirement will enable investors and the Commissionstaff to determine when information on the transition period will be available.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ For a discussion of new Item 8 of Form 8-K, <T3>see </T3>II.A.8., <T3>infra.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="81">2. </ITAG>Filing Requirements for Transition Reports To parallel the current filing requirements for Form 10-K, the amendmentschange the time for filing a transition report on Form 10-K from 120 to90 days after the close of the transition period or the date of the determinationto change the fiscal year, whichever is later.\32\<NOTE/> The 90 day filing period applies to all transition reportsfiled on Form 10-K, regardless of the length of the transition period,and should give issuers sufficient time to have audited financial statementsprepared covering transition periods of any length. To parallel the currentfiling requirements for Form 10-Q, an issuer that chooses to file a separatetransition report on Form 10-Q must file that report within 45 days afterthe later of the close of the transition period or the date of the determinationto change the fiscal year.\33\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ <T3>See </T3>amended Rules 13a-10(b) and 15d-10(b). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ <T3>See </T3>amended Rules 13a-10(c) and 15d-10(c). <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Requirements for Changing a Fiscal Year After the Year End </ITAG>Amended Rules 13a-10(a) and 15d-10(a) codify current staff rule interpretationsby requiring an issuer to file an annual report for any fiscal year thatended before the date on which the issuer determined to change its fiscalyear end. An issuer is required to report this date in the Form 8-K reportingits change in fiscal year.\34\<NOTE/> In most cases, the date would be evidenced by minutes ofthe issuer's board of directors or an authorized committee thereof.\35\<NOTE/> The amendments also codify the staff interpretive positionthat a transition report can be used only for periods of less than 12 months.Transition reports are not permitted for periods longer than 12 monthsbecause of the difficulties of constructing data for comparable periodsthat would be useful in understanding trends in a business.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ <T3>See </T3>discussion of new Item 8 of Form 8-K at II.A.8., <T3>infra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ Other evidence of the date could include a contemporaneouspublic announcement or press release.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Financial Reporting Requirements for Transition Periods </ITAG>Under the amendments, financial statements in transition reports on Form10-K must be audited. In contrast, unaudited financial statements are permittedin transition reports on Form 10-Q. Under the amendments, a transition report on Form 10-K must include eitherfinancial statements, which may be unaudited, for the comparable periodof the prior year, or a footnote, which may be unaudited, giving specifiedinformation for the comparable period of the prior year.\36\<NOTE/> The prior year footnote information must state, at a minimum,revenues, gross profits, income taxes, income or loss from continuing operationsbefore extraordinary items and cumulative effect of a change in accountingprinciples, and net income or loss. The effects of any discontinued operationsand/or extraordinary items as classified under the provisions of generallyaccepted accounting principles also must be shown, if applicable. Per sharedata based upon such income or loss and net income or loss is requiredto be presented in conformity with applicable accounting standards.\37\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ <T3>See </T3>amended Rules 13a-10(b) and 15d-10(b). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ The prior year footnote information tracks Rule 1-02(aa))of Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210.1-02(aa), except that disclosure of incometaxes is required under the amendments because such information is pertinentto undertstanding the fluctuations in earnings and earnings trends. One commentator recommended that the amendments address whether the financialstatements or footnote information for the comparable period of the prioryear must be included in subsequent filings. The amendments as adoptedhave been changed to specify that, where called for by the time span covered,subsequent filings must include such statements or information. Consistent with existing requirements for Form 10-Q, a transition reporton Form 10-Q also is required to include financial information about thecomparable period of the prior year.\38\<NOTE/> As suggested by one commentator, the amendments as adoptedstate that schedules need not be filed in transition reports on Form 10-Q.\39\<NOTE/> When an issuer files a transition report on Form 10-Q, separateaudited statements of income and cash flows covering the transition periodare required to be filed as part of the first annual report for the newlyadopted fiscal year.\40\<NOTE/> The annual report also must contain a separate audited balancesheet for a transition period of less than six months, if an audited balancesheet as of the end of the prior fiscal year is not filed. Further, theamendments specify that notes to the financial statements for the transitionperiod included in the annual report may be integrated with the notes forthe full fiscal period.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ <T3>See </T3>II.A.5., ``Quarterly Reporting When an Issuer Changes ItsFiscal Year,'' <T3>infra</T3>, for a discussion of the new Note to paragraphs (c) and(e) of Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 that addresses difficulties in providingcomparable period financial information. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ However, schedules for such transition periods are requiredto be filed in subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K pursuant to Rules5-04 (17 CFR 210.5-04), 7-05 (17 CFR 210.7-05), and 9-07 (17 CFR 210.9-07)of Regulation S-X where the income statements covering the transition periodare required to be audited. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ <T3>See </T3>amended Rules 13a-10(c) and 15d-10(c). As discussed above, pursuant to amended Rule 13a-10(d) or 15d-10(d), inspecified circumstances, an issuer may include information about a transitionperiod of one month or less in its first quarterly report on Form 10-Qfor the newly adopted fiscal year after the date of determination to changeits year end, rather than in a separate transition report. If this is done,the financial statements required by Part I, which may be unaudited, mustbe furnished separately for the transition period as part of the Form 10-Q.\41\<NOTE/> In addition, the issuer must file with the first annual reportof the newly adopted fiscal year separate audited statements of incomeand cash flows covering the transition period. If the issuer's next reportis a Form 10-K rather than a Form 10-Q, all of the required informationfor the transition period must be included in the Form 10-K. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ The information covering the transition period requiredby Part II and Item 2 of Part I, ``Management's Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of Operations,'' may be combined withthe information regarding the quarter. Commentators asked for clarification of the application of the requirementsof Item 303, ``Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditionand Results of Operations,'' \42\<NOTE/> of Regulation S-K \43\<NOTE/> to transition periods.

Quarterly Reporting When an Issuer Changes Its Fiscal Year </ITAG>The amendments to Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 are intended to clarify the requirementsfor filing quarterly reports in change of fiscal year circumstances.\4\\8\<NOTE/> The amendments codify the current staff practice of requiringissuers to file quarterly reports during the transition period. Under theamendments, companies continue to have the option of filing such quarterlyreports based on the quarters of either the old or newly adopted fiscalyear.\4\\9\<NOTE/> Under either option, an issuer still is required to filea quarterly report for any quarter of the old fiscal year that ended beforethe date on which the issuer determined to change its fiscal year end,except where the last day of the quarter also is the last day of the transitionperiod.\5\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ <T3>See</T3> amended Rules 13a-10(e) and 15d-10(e).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ <T3>See</T3> amended Rules 13a-10(e)(2) and 15d-10(e)(2). Thus, an issuerwith a December 31 year end that decides on February 1, 1990 to changeits year end to October 31, 1990 has the option of filing quarterly reportseither for the quarters of the old fiscal year ending March 31, June 30,and September 30, 1990 or for the periods coinciding with quarters of thenew fiscal year ending January 31, April 30, and July 31, 1990. If thesame issuer had decided on June 1, 1990 to change its year end to October31, 1990, the issuer already would have filed a quarterly report for thequarter ending March 31, 1990 but still would have the option to file thequarterly reports either for the quarters of the old fiscal year endingJune 30 and September 30, 1990 or for the period coinciding with the quarterof the new fiscal year ending July 31, 1990.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ <T3>See</T3> amended Rules 13a-10(e)(1) and 15d-10(e)(1). For example,an issuer with a December 31 year end that decides on October 15, 1990to change its year end to November 30, 1990 is required to file by November14, 1990 a quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September30, 1990 of the old fiscal year. If the same issuer decided on October15, 1990 to change its year end to September 30, 1990, the issuer is notrequired to file a quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periodending September 30, 1990 of the old fiscal year, because the last dayof the quarter would be the same as the last day of the transition period.In the event, a transition report on Form 10-K is required to be filedwithin 90 days after October 15, 1990 to cover the transition period fromJanuary 1, 1990 through September 30, 1990.The amendments also specify the time by which an issuer must begin filingquarterly reports on the basis of the newly adopted fiscal year. An issueris required to begin filing quarterly reports on the new basis with thequarterly report for the first quarter of the new fiscal year ending afterthe issuer determined to change its fiscal year end.\5\\1\<NOTE/> With respect to quarterly periods ending before the issuer'sdetermination to change its year end, no reporting on the new basis isrequired.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ See amended Rules 13a-10(e)(3) and 15d-10(e)(3). In thefirst example in footnote 50, a Form 10-Q is required for the first quarter(ending February 28, 1991) of the new fiscal year.The switch in quarterly reporting from the old to the new fiscal year mayresult in a period of less than three months that is not covered by a separatereport on Form 10-Q. The Proposing Release stated that such a period wouldbe covered on a cumulative basis in the next report on either Form 10-Q,Form 10-K or in a transition report, depending on when the switch occurred.One commentator noted that, under the proposals, the disclosure of somenon-financial information about such a period might not be required inthe next Form 10-Q and thus might be delayed, and further that it mightbe difficult for investors to derive financial information about such aperiod from cumulative financial information disclosed in the next Form10-Q or other later reports.The amendments as adopted have been modified to specify that, unless sucha period of less than three months is or will be covered in the issuer'stransition report or in the first annual report on Form 10-K for the newlyadopted fiscal year, information (<T3>e.g.,</T3> legal proceedings, changes in securities) about such periodmust be included in the issuer's initial report on Form 10-Q for the newlyadopted fiscal year.\5\\2\<NOTE/> Separate financial statements covering such period, whichmay be unaudited, must be furnished therewith.\5\\3\<NOTE/> These modifications do not require any additional reports,only that the financial information also be set out separately, and notjust cumulatively.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\2\ The information covering the transition period requiredby Part II and Item 2 of Part I, ``Management's Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of Operations,'' may be combined withthe information regarding the quarter.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\3\ <T3>See</T3> amended Rules 13a-10(e)(4) and 15d-10(e)(4) and Appendix Example1.e. For example, an issuer with a December 31 year end decides on June1, 1990 to change its year end to October 31, 1990 and begins filing quarterlyreports based on the quarters of the new fiscal year with the quarterlyreport for the quarter ending July 31, 1990. Under the amendments, theperiod from April 1 through April 30, 1990 would not be covered by a separatereport on Form 10-Q. That period would be required to be covered in thequarterly report filed for the quarter ending July 31, 1990, and separatefinancial statements covering April 1 through April 30, 1990 would be requiredto be filed with that quarterly report.The amendments also specify when recasting of prior year quarterly financialinformation is not required for an issuer that changes to a new fiscalyear end that does not coincide with the end of a quarter of the previousfiscal year. A new Note to paragraphs (c) and (e) of Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10permits an issuer to file quarterly reports for the quarters of the newfiscal year without recasting data for the prior fiscal year, where recastingeither is not practicable or cannot be cost-justified, if the issuer furnishes(1) financial statements for the quarters of the preceding fiscal yearmost nearly comparable to the quarters in the newly adopted fiscal year;(2) an adequate discussion of seasonal and other factors that could affectthe comparability of information or trends reflected; (3) an assessmentof the comparability of the data; and (4) a representation as to the reasonthe recasting has not been undertaken. The Note also applies to prior yearinformation in transition reports on Form 10-Q.\5\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\4\ The amendments do not require an issuer that decidesto change its year end after having filed quarterly reports based on theold fiscal year to file new Form 10-Qs for those quarters of the new fiscalyear already concluded. However, pursuant to Item 302(a)(5) of RegulationS-K [17 CFR 229.302(a)(5)], specified issuers must provide selected financialdata for each full quarter of the two most recent fiscal years in theirannual reports on Form 10-K. Accordingly, the first annual report on Form10-K of such an issuer after a fiscal year change would be required tocontain historical quarterly information on the basis of the new fiscalyear.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Transition Reporting for Successor Issuers</ITAG>Amended Rules 13a-10(f) and 15d-10(f) specify transition reporting requirementsfor successor issuers with a different fiscal year end from that of thepredecessor. No transition report is required where the successor issuerand the predecessor have the same fiscal year end. Under such circumstances,the successor issuer continues to report on the same reporting scheduleas that of the predecessor.\5\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\5\ <T3>See</T3> Rules 12g-3 (17 CFR 240.12g-3) and 15d-5 (17 CFR 240.15d-5).While former Rule 13a-10 specified reporting requirements only for successorissuers with securities registered on Form 8-B,\5\\6\<NOTE/> the amendments cover all successor issuers.\5\\7\<NOTE/> Although former Rule 15d-10 had no provision covering transitionreporting for successor issuers, the amendments add such a provision tocover companies with reporting obligations pursuant to section 15(d).\5\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\6\ 17 CFR 249.208b.

The principal difference isthe period to be covered in the transition report. The period to be reportedon by a successor issuer ends on the date of the succession, rather thanon the day prior to the beginning of the newly adopted year, in order toreflect the predecessor's operations separately from those of the successor.\5\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\9\ Where the successor issuer and the predecessor havea different fiscal year end and the succession is solely for the purposeof forming a holding company or changing the state of incorporation, thesuccession will be viewed as any change in fiscal year and not subjectto the provisions of amended Rules 13a-10(f) and 15d-10(f).For a transition period of six or more months, the amendments require asuccessor issuer to file a transition report on Form 10-K, including auditedfinancial statements, within 90 days after the date of the succession.\6\\0\<NOTE/> For a transition period shorter than six months, the successorissuer has the option to file the transition report on either Form 10-K,including audited financial statements, within 90 days after the date ofthe succession, or Form 10-Q, including unaudited financial statements,within 45 days after the date of the succession.\6\\1\<NOTE/> If the transition report is filed on Form 10-Q, the nextannual report of the successor issuer must include audited statements ofincome and cash flows for the transition period. For a transition periodof one month or less, no separate transition report is required, providedthat information on the transition period is included in the successorissuer's report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter that ends after thedate of the succession, or if the successor issuer's next report is anannual report, in that annual report.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\0\ <T3>See</T3> amended Rules 13a-10(f) and 15d-10(f) and Appendix Example2.b.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\1\ <T3>See</T3> amended Rules 13a-10(f) and 15d-10(f) and Appendix Example2.a.These amendments, which give an issuer the option to use either Form 10-Kor Form 10-Q for transition periods shorter than six months, differ fromthe proposals, which would have required a successor issuer to file a transitionreport on Form 10-Q for such shorter transition periods. Like the optionafforded other issuers that change their fiscal year, the option is availableto successor issuers so that they may furnish audited financial statementscovering the transition period in the first instance, and avoid the possibilityof revision in a later audit of previously released unaudited financialinformation about the transition period.\6\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\2\ Other current reporting requirements for successorissuers and the Division's current interpretive positions respecting disclosuresby successor issuers are not affected. As noted in the Proposing Release,when there is a change in accounting basis between the successor and predecessor,the quarterly or annual report for the period in which the succession occursis required to present separately the statements of income and cash flowsto reflect the periods prior and subsequent to the succession.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Transition Reporting for Foreign Private Issuers  </ITAG>The Commission is adopting separate transition reporting provisions forforeign private issuers. The separate provisions provide specific guidelinesfor foreign private issuers in change of fiscal year circumstances andare consistent with other separate reporting requirements and separatereporting forms for such issuers. In addition, given the varied reportingrequirements and practices in foreign jurisdictions, in appropriate cases,the Commission staff will consider requests to modify the transition reportingrequirements for foreign private issuers to take account of varying domicilecountry reporting requirements and practices.  Under amended Rules 13a-10(g) and 15d-10(g), a foreign private issuer isrequired to file a Form 20-F to report on all transition periods, exceptthose of one month or less. Where the transition period is longer thansix months, such issuer is required to file a transition report on Form20-F that contains responses to all items required when the form is usedas an annual report and includes audited financial statements.\6\\3\<NOTE/> For transition periods of six or fewer months, the amendmentsgive a foreign private issuer an option similar to that given domesticissuers. The foreign private issuer may file its transition report on Form20-F, either with responses to all items required when Form 20-F is usedas an annual reporting form and including audited financial statements,or, in the alternative, with responses to a limited number of specifieditems and including unaudited financial statements.\6\\4\<NOTE/> The Commission has determined not to require a foreign privateissuer to file a separate transition report for a transition period ofone month or less if the first annual report for the newly adopted fiscalyear covers the transition period as well as the fiscal year. As with domesticissuers, the costs associated with filing separate transition reports forsuch limited periods of one month or less are not justified by the minimalbenefit to investors.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\3\Form 20-F generally is used by foreign private issuersas a registration statement, as well as an annual report. General InstructionG(b) of Form 20-F specifies that an annual report on Form 20-F shall includethe information specified in Parts I, III and IV of the Form.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\4\The items, which cover most of the subjects coveredin a Form 10-Q, are: Item 3, ``Legal Proceedings;'' Item 9, ``Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;''Item 15, ``Defaults Upon Senior Securities;'' Item 16, ``Changes in Securitiesand Changes in Security for Registered Securities;'' and either Item 17or 18, ``Financial Statements.''  In the Proposing Release, the Commission proposed the same cutoff for foreignprivate issuers as domestic issuers. The Commission, however, has determinedto adopt for foreign private issuers a different cutoff from that usedfor domestic issuers. While domestic issuers have the option to file transitionreports on Form 10-Q with unaudited financial statements only for transitionperiods shorter than six months, foreign private issuers have the optionof filing an abbreviated Form 20-F with unaudited financial statementsfor transition periods of six or fewer months. The different cutoff forforeign private issuers is adopted to be consistent with the reportingpractices of some foreign private issuers, which develop interim financialstatements that cover semi-annual periods pursuant to the laws or practicesof their domicile country or rules of exchanges upon which their securitiesare traded.\6\\5\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\5\<T3>Cf.</T3> Release No. 34-24634 (June 23, 1987) (52 FR 24230) in whichthe Commission approved proposed rule changes by the American and New YorkStock Exchanges permitting the exchanges to waive or modify specified listingstandards for foreign securities. The Commission noted that the proposalswould permit some foreign companies to report interim earnings on a semi-annualrather than quarterly basis.  Under the amendments, a transition report on Form 20-F with responses toonly the selected items and unaudited financial statements is requiredto be filed within three months after the close of the transition periodor the date of the determination to change the fiscal year, whichever islater. A transition report on Form 20-F with responses to all items requiredwhen the form is used as an annual report and including audited financialstatements must be filed within six months after the later of these twoevents. This six-month filing period parallels the filing period for annualreports on Form 20-F.  In the Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comment on whether foreignprivate issuers should be excused from providing unaudited financial statementsin transition reports if they are not required to develop such statementsunder the laws or practices of their domicile country, or any exchangeupon which their securities trade. While two commentators agreed with theexception, the Commission is not adopting the exception as part of Rules13a-10(g) and 15d-10(g). Because the financial reporting practices of foreignprivate issuers vary, the Commission had determined that requests for suchan exception will be considered by the staff in appropriate circumstances,particularly where an issuer can demonstrate that developing such financialdata would not be practicable or cost-justified.\6\\6\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\6\<T3>See</T3> Rule 3-13 of Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210.3-13), which allowsthe Commission to waive the filing of financial statements upon informalwritten request of an issuer and where consistent with the protection ofinvestors.   <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Reporting Fiscal Year Changes on Form 8-K  </ITAG>The Commission also is adopting amendments to require an issuer to reporton a Form 8-K its decision to adopt a new fiscal year in response to anew Item 8. Formal notice of a change in reporting periods should eliminateconfusion and misapprehension as to the reasons for issuer's financialreports not being filed and provide an orderly and reliable mechanism forgetting news of the change to investors.  Under the amendments, the issuer must report both the date of its determinationto change its fiscal year end and the date of its new fiscal year end.\6\\7\<NOTE/> In addition, to accommodate the option to file either a Form10-K or Form 10-Q covering a transition period shorter than six months,\6\\8\<NOTE/> the amendments as adopted are modified to require the issuerto state in its Form 8-K the particular Form on which the report coveringthe transition period will be filed. This information should be availableat the time of filing the Form 8-K because of the planning required foran audit.\6\\9\<NOTE/> The report on Form 8-K must be filed within 15 days afterthe date of the issuer's determination to change its fiscal year end. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\7\<T3>See</T3> discussion of the provisions of changing a fiscal year afterthe end of that particular year at II.A.3., <T3>supra.</T3>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\8\<T3>See</T3> discussion at II.A.1., ``Transition Reporting on Forms 10-Qand 10-K,'' <T3>supra.</T3>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\9\If the issuer decides later to file the report coveringthe transition period on a form different from the form specified in itsForm 8-K reporting the change in fiscal year, the issuer should file anamended Form 8-K stating the change.<ITAG tagnum="81">9.

As in the past, the staff will continueto accept in annual reports on Form 10-K and annual reports to shareholdersthe restatement of prior period financial statements to conform with anissuer's newly adopted fiscal year, although such restatement will notbe required.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\5\ See Rule 3-18 of Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210.3-18).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. </ITAG>Amendment to Rule 3-12To assure more timely financial statements of first-time issuers, the Commissionis adopting an amendment to Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X.\8\\6\<NOTE/> The amendment, which codifies staff practice, specifies thatthe registrant's most recent audited financial statements in a registrationstatement filed under the Securities Act or on Form 10 under the ExchangeAct that relates to the securities of a non-reporting issuer may not bemore than one year and 45 days old at the date of effectiveness of theregistration statement.\8\\7\<NOTE/> Prior to the amendments, by changing its fiscal year end,an issuer that was not a reporting company before filing a registrationstatement could have attempted to file and have declared effective a registrationstatement with financial statements up to 18 and one-half months old.\8\\8\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>86 <T3>See </T3>new paragraph (d); former paragraphs (d) and (e) have beenredesignated. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\7\ The wording of the amendment has been modified to clarifythat the one year and 45 day rule does not apply to financial statementsother than those of the registrant. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>88 Rule 3-01(b) of Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210.3-01(b)) haspermitted specified registrants to use unaudited financial statements thatare at least as current as the third fiscal quarter of the most recentlycompleted fiscal year if their registration statement is filed within 45days after the end of the most recent fiscal year. Thus, under the formerrules, a first-time registrant under the Securities Act with a December31, 1986 year end that changed its year end in 1987 to May 31, 1987 couldhave filed unaudited financial statements covering the transition periodfrom January 1, 1987 through May 31, 1987 and unaudited financial statementscovering the subsequent nine months ending February 29, 1988 in a registrationstatement and attempted to have that registration statement declared effectiveon July 14, 1988. The most recently audited financial statements in theregistration statement would have covered the year ending December 31,1986. The amendment applies only to companies not yet in the Exchange Act reportingsystem because their financial and business history is not available toinvestors and the marketplace. As noted in the Proposing Release, the oneyear and 45 day cutoff for the age of non-reporting company financial statementsis consistent with those requirements of Rule 3-01 of Regulation S-X thatlimit the age of the financial statements in a registration statement ofa company that previously has not been reporting pursuant to the requirementsof the Exchange Act.\8\\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>89 Rule 3-01(b) provides that the audited financial statementsof the prior fiscal year may not be used more than 45 days after the endof the current fiscal year, unless the specified circumstances in Rule3-01(c) (17 CFR 210.3-01(c)) exist, which include the requirement thatthe registrant be filing reports pursuant to Section 13 (15 U.S.C. 78m)or 15(d). In addition, Rule 3-01(a) (17 CFR 210.3-01(a)) requires a registrantthat has been in existence for less than one fiscal year to file auditedfinancial statements within 135 days of the date of filing the registrationstatement.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. </ITAG>Quarterly Reporting: First Report to be Filed on Form 10-QFinally, the Commission is adopting amendments to Rules 13a-13 and 15d-13to eliminate any gap in the reporting period between the financial informationincluded in a registration statement and the first report on Form 10-Q.\9\\0\<NOTE/> Under the amendments, the requirement to file quarterly reportscommences with the first fiscal quarter following the most recent fiscalyear or full quarter for which financial statements were included in theregistration statement.\9\\1\<NOTE/> A first-time registrant is required to file its first Form10-Q the later of 45 days after the effectiveness of the registration statement,or the date on which such report would have been required to be filed ifthe issuer had been a reporting company as of its last fiscal quarter.Prior to the amendments, an issuer's first report on Form 10-Q was requiredto be filed commencing with the first quarter ending after the effectivedate of its first registration statement.\9\\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>90 <T3>Cf. </T3>Rule 15d-2 (17 CFR 240.15d-2), which eliminates a similarreporting gap by requiring an issuer whose registration statement becomeseffective after a fiscal year end without audited financial statementsas of such fiscal year end in the prospectus to file a special report within90 days of effectiveness on the form appropriate for annual reports ofthe registrant. The special report must include audited financial statementsfor the last full fiscal year. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>91 <T3>See </T3>amended Rules 13a-13(a) and 15d-13(a). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>92 For example, under the amendments, a registrant with aDecember 31 year end whose registration statement became effective on April14, 1990 including financial statements as of December 31 of the prioryear, is required to file a quarterly report for the quarter ending March31, 1990. The quarterly report is not due until 45 days after April 14,1990, the date of effectiveness. Under the former rules, the same registrantwould not have been required to file a quarterly report for the quarterending on March 31, 1990. The former rules only would have required itsfirst quarterly report for the quarter ending June 30, 1990.As is currently the case, first-time registrants generally will continueto be required to commence filing quarterly reports at the time specified,regardless of whether they have operations during this period.\9\\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\3\Generally, the staff has taken the position that registrantsunder the Securities Act whose registration statements are declared effectiveshortly before the end of their fiscal year, thereby creating ExchangeAct reporting requirements pursuant to section 15(d), are required to fileannual and quarterly reports even where the registrant has not commencedoperations; for example, where the registrant is in the process of a bestefforts offering and has not yet met the minimum, or where an acquisitionby the registrant has not yet been completed pending regulatory approval.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Cost-Benefit Analysis </ITAG>In the Proposing Release, the Commission requested commentators to provideviews and data as to the costs and benefits associated with the proposedamendments to Exchange Act Rules 12b-25, 13a-10, 14a-3, and 15d-10, Forms8-K, 10-K, 10-Q, 20-F, and 12b-25, proposed new Investment Company ActRule 30b1-3, the proposed amendments to Investment Company Act Rules 8b-16and 30b1-2 and Form N-SAR, proposed new Rule 3-06 and the proposed amendmentto Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X. Four commentators expressed views specifically on the costs and benefitsassociated with the reporting requirements for transition periods shorterthan three months. One commentator believed that the requirement of separatetransition reports for such shorter transition periods would not be costbeneficial as data concerning such periods would not be accompanied bysimilar disclosure for comparable historical periods. Another commentatorthat found the requirement unnecessary stated that the additional costsof such reports would not be substantial, but that the benefits would decreaseas the transition period becomes shorter. As noted above in Part II.A.1.,the amendments as adopted do not require a separate transition report fortransition periods of one month or less. Two other commentators expressed concerns that the costs of presentingaudited financial statements covering shorter transition periods of lessthan three months in the first annual report of the newly adopted fiscalyear would outweigh the benefits because of the short period covered andbecause such audited financial statements would be over one year old whenpresented. The amendments have not modified substantially the former rulesin this regard. The Commission also requested views and data as to the costs and benefitsassociated with amending Rules 13a-13 and 15d-13 to require a new registrantto file its first report on Form 10-Q for the first quarterly period otherthan the fourth quarter ending after the annual or quarterly period coveredby the most recent financial statements included in its effective registrationstatement. The Commission noted that this revision should benefit investorsby providing more timely and complete financial information about a first-timeregistrant for the period following the latest financial information inan effective registration statement. No comments were received on the costsand benefits associated with these amendments. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
