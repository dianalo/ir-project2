The proposed new bank loans are part of a restructuring of Argentina's huge foreign debt negotiated last month. The agreement requires all of the country's creditor banks to contribute sums equal to 9% of their medium-term and long-term Argentine loans outstanding as of June 30, 1982.    However, analysts and bankers said it will be harder to persuade many smaller banks to participate in these new loans, now that two of the largest U.S. commercial banks are effectively admitting that many of their Latin American loans aren't valued at 100 cents on the dollar.    &quot;The new money is going to be a lot harder to gather,&quot; said Alan Stoga, a senior associate at Kissinger Associates Inc., a consulting firm. &quot;(The extra reserves) have made it harder to maintain the fiction of the full value of most Latin American debt,&quot; he said.    The huge loan-loss reserve increases &quot;won't be helpful for raising new money for big debtor countries,&quot; said an adviser to a major debtor country. But he said that the big banks' move &quot;will be helpful in that it allows more flexibility&quot; in debt management through debt-for-equity swaps and loan sales.    If the assembly of the Argentine loan is slow and difficult, relations between Argentina and its creditors could become strained. Also, it's probable that large banks will end up providing proportionately more of the loans, while some small banks succeed in shirking their obligation to lend more to Argentina, analysts say.    In what bankers see as an attempt to speed up banks' participation in new Argentine loans, Citicorp, which is heading the lending effort, will today announce that a recent $500 million World Bank loan for Argentina will be co-financed by commercial banks, banking sources said. This means that commercial banks would lend Argentina $500 million alongside the World Bank's $500 million.    The commercial-bank money would be counted as part of the $1.95 billion of proposed bank loans for Argentina. Commercial banks are usually more eager to lend to developing countries when their loans are made jointly with the World Bank.    Citicorp declined to comment.    Last week, Citicorp shocked the banking community when it added $3 billion to loan-loss reserves, citing problems with its loans to developing countries. Chase followed on Wednesday by adding $1.6 billion to its loan-loss reserves. And several other big U.S. banks are expected to take similar steps soon.    Most other big U.S. banks are now trying to decide exactly how they should respond to these landmark moves, and are also trying to assess what such decisions mean for their developing-country debts, and for the proposed Argentine loan. &quot;Obviously, what Citicorp and Chase have done is making banks chew (the Argentine loan) over a lot more,&quot; said one senior U.S. banker.    Citicorp heads the committee of 11 major international banks that negotiates with Argentina on behalf of the country's creditor banks. This committee of banks now is working with the Argentines to raise the new bank loans.    The five U.S. bank committee members -- BankAmerica Corp., Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. -- have all already pledged their shares of the new Argentine loans, banking sources said. These shares total about $400 million, according to the sources.    The $1.95 billion of new bank loans for Argentina is made up of a medium-term bank loan of $1.55 billion and a trade credit and deposit facility of $400 million. The $500 million commercial-bank portion of the financing with the World Bank will come out of bank contributions to the medium-term bank loan, banking sources said.    The proposed Argentine debt accord negotiated last month already offers commercial banks new lending options, including provisions for debt-for-equity swaps, and for so-called exit bonds which allow banks to sell as much as $5 million of their Argentine loans. These new features were prompted by the difficulty in gathering $7.7 billion of new bank loans for Mexico, which were finally signed earlier this year. Several smaller creditor banks never joined in these loans. </TEXT></DOC>
