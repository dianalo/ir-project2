They areescaping from high-tax states to states that let them keepmore of their money.   The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, apermanent bipartisan body created by Congress in 1959, hasattempted to calculate the state-by-state tax burden. Thecommission arrives at its conclusions by dividing eachstate's tax base by the actual taxes paid per capita. Thisexercise yields an index number of &quot;tax effort&quot; for eachstate. An index number above 100 indicates relatively heavyexploitation of the tax base; an index number below 100indicates relatively light exploitation.</LP><TEXT>   The states with the heaviest tax burdens have been losingpopulation to the states with the lightest. Between 1975 and1988, New York had the heaviest tax burden in the country --62.6% above the national average. It also will have lost moreelectoral votes between 1972 and 1992 than any other state.Florida, among the four lowest-tax states over those 13years, had a tax burden almost 25% below the nationalaverage. Between 1972 and 1992 it gained eight electoralvotes, more than any other state in the nation.   Altogether, the 10 states whose relative population grewfastest between 1970 and 1990 -- Nevada, Arizona, Alaska,Florida, Utah, Texas, California, New Hampshire, New Mexicoand Washington (in that order) -- had a relative tax burdennearly 12% below the U.S. average. Collectively, those 10states will have 31 more electoral votes in 1992 than theydid in 1972.   In contrast, the 10 states that have been losing relativepopulation fastest -- Iowa, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,Michigan, Massachusetts, West Virginia, Illinois, NorthDakota and Indiana -- had tax efforts more than 10% above theU.S. average. These states will together have lost 29electoral votes since 1972.   Taxes seem to depress employment even more thanpopulation. The best 10 states for employment growth --Nevada, Arizona, Florida, Alaska, New Hampshire, Washington,Georgia, Vermont, California and Utah -- averaged 77% growthin the number of jobs between 1974 and 1989. The worst 10 --West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, New York,Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, Montana and Louisiana -- averagedjust 18%. The top 10 job-producing states had a relative taxeffort 6% below the U.S. average. The worst 10 job producersposted results 4% percent above the national average.   These grand totals are confirmed by surveys of individualbehavior. A 1989 investigation of emigrants from Michigan in1984 and 1985 found that 86% percent of the 39,674 tax filerswho moved to another state chose states that had discardedtheir separate death or inheritance tax. Because Michiganmaintains its own death taxes, in addition to federal taxes,a person who has been left a $1 million estate will typicallyreceive nearly $38,000 less than in most other states.Michigan also imposes punitive taxation on wealth and income.It enjoys the dubious distinction of the highest unemploymentinsurance premiums of any of the nation's 15 most populousstates -- largely because it pays weekly benefits $50 higherthan the national average. This is tantamount to anemployment tax.   The superior population and employment growth of low-taxstates is unaffected by size or region. Small low-tax states,such as Arizona and Colorado, do just as well as big lowtax-states, such as Florida and California. Low-tax states inthe North, such as New Hampshire, do just as well as low-taxstates in the South, such as Georgia.   If deductibility of state and local taxes is capped, ashas been suggested in Washington's budget negotiations, highincome-tax states, such as New York and Massachusetts, wouldexperience disproportionately great capital flight becausethe effective marginal tax rate on income in those stateswould escalate dramatically. The Heartland Institute inChicago confirms that for each 1% increase in a state's taxeffort relative to the national average, personal incomegrowth in that state will fall behind the U.S. average by0.6% per year.   Americans are voting with their feet. States that aredreading the results of the current census can easily, then,improve their performance on the one coming in 2000 simply bycutting taxes.   ---   Mr. Littman is vice president of the ManufacturersNational Bank of Detroit.</TEXT></DOC>
