TriLAN could also cost-effectively replace manyexisting server based phone-mail systems, directing calls to the properuser's mail box and giving users online access to their stored calls.andM;James Schalow, general manager of Dukane's network integration division,explained that TriLAN would not be feasible without the full 16Mbps TokenRing bandwidth.andP;  &quot;TriLAN allocates the bandwidth dynamically&quot; to eachstation, he said, explaining that each station gets the entire 16Mbpscapacity when it transmits.andM;And without Token Ring's deterministic nature, TriLAN would be impossible toimplement, according to Schalow.andP;  Token Ring technology passes a &quot;token&quot;around the electrical ring from one station to another in a predictablepattern, guaranteeing the exact moment when a station is allowed to put dataon the ring.andM;Without this guaranteed access, voice can't be put on the wire reliably.andO;&quot;When you're dealing with voice, it must be delivered in real time, unlikedata, which can wait&quot; before going out over the network, Schalow said.andP;  Oneof the beauties of Trilan's approach is that multiple voice conversations cantake place concurrently over the single Token Ring line.andP;  Ethernet could notsupport such advanced functions.andM;Physically, a TRILAN looks like a typical Token Ring data-only network:Network cabling is connected to media-access units  (MAUS) and networkinterface cards  (NICS) in a logical token-passing ring that can also be, butseldom is, a physical ring (See Figure 1).andP;  There are some major differences,of course.andP;  For example, Dukane calls its MAU a node coupling unit (NCU).andP;  ATRILAN network also contains a gateway connection to the company phone systemvia either a private branch exchange (PBX) or central switching office.andM;A Cascaded StarandM;A TriLAN network operates in a cascaded-star topology made up of as many aseight daisy-chained NCUS, said Dukane engineering manager Victor Nowakowski.andO;Each NCU acts as a miniring concentrator that supports up to eightPC/telephone nodes to form a 64-node workgroup.andP;  The intelligent NCU monitorsthe physical connection between a group of networked PCs and the token ring.andO;Like most Token Ring MAUS, Dukane's NCU provides bypass routing when one ormore nodes malfunctions, thus sparing the network possible catastrophe.andM;A TRILAN node can be:andM;1.andP;  A PC containing Trilan's Token Ring network interface card (NIC) in anexpansion slot, with a TRILAN PC/telephone Application  Node  phone pluggedinto the NIC;andM;2.andP;  A digital-feature telephone and telephone node (as Dukane calls itsstandalone phone product); orandM;3.andP;  A video-imaging node, which has not yet been announced by Dukane.andM;The TriLAN NIC contains a telephone Jack for connecting Trilan'sPC/application phone node to the network (this connection is not shown inFigure 1).andP;  TRILAN adapters, based on the TMS380C 4/16Mbps chip set developedby Texas Instruments in conjunction with IBM, are compatible with other TokenRings.andM;In a TRILAN network PC, the TriLAN Token Ring adapter card and digitalPC/telephone  Application Node work in tandem to place PC-based data anddigitized voice on a single pair of shielded twisted-pair Token Ring cables.andM;Other Dukane-made components in a TriLAN network include separate gateways tothe local PBX and/or phone company switching center (CO, for central office,in the diagram) and IBM mainframe or other communications service (forexample, X.25 or Integrated Services Digital Networks [ISDNS], and aring-to-ring local bridge).andP;  The gateway to the PBX/CO is necessary, ofcourse, to integrate an organization's voice traffic into the data network.andM;The data section of the NIC, which contains the required 4/16Mbps Token Ringcircuitry, including (as noted) the TMS380C chip set, handles allencoding/decoding of network packets, including moving digitized voice ontoand off of the ring.andP;  Trilan's voice processing capabilities include severalcall functions, such as call forwarding and waiting, speed dialing, andconferencing, all distributed to each phone on the network.andP;  The TRILANsystem also supports the call functions provided by ISDN technology.andM;The standalone phone node, for use by computerless employees within theboundaries of a TRILAN workgroup, supports up to eight TRILAN digital phones.andO;These phones operate independently of the PCs on the network.andM;For inter-work-group connections, Trilan's ring-to-ring bridge will supportup to 32 primary TRILAN rings; according to Dukane, this means a TRILAN LANcan support more than 2,000 nodes.andP;  The bridge supports 100Mbps FDDI (fiberdistributed data interface) technology for internetwork communication.andO;TRILAN communicates with wide area networks, host computers, and other LANSvia a variety of gateways that Dukane says will support ISDN protocols, othertoken rings, and IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA).andP;  The company alsosaid it plans to develop gateways for connection to Ethernet, X.25, and otherFDDI gateways.andM;On the software side, TRILAN will be available for Novell's Netware networkoperating system (NOS) and MS-Dos-based NOS.andP;  Dukane said it will eventuallysupport LAN Manager with TriLAN, too.andM;As Figure 2 shows, a TriLAN network operates on five levels.andP;  At the top isthe application software, such as a database or spreadsheet, that gives usershigh-level access to data.andP;  One step down is the NOS-netware or a DOS-basedsystem.andP;  it communicates with a data BIOS (for Basic input/output OperatingSystem) such as NetBIOS or the Dukane-developed phone BIOS.andP;  (These BIOSShandle routing of data or voice over the network cable.)andM;Dukane has also announced it will ship an applications development kit withapplication program interfaces (APIs) to the data and phone BIOSs that willhelp developers integrate their products into a TriLAN.andP;  Dukane's TriLANadapter card, developed around the TMS380 Token Ring chip set, provides thephysical and data-link connection to the wire.andP;  What it CostsandM;Although exact costs per node or network will depend on configuration,according to Schalow, users can expect to pay about $1,600 to $2,000 perend-user connection; this includes the cost of the in-PC adapter, NCU, andgateway to a PBX.andP;  At first, TriLAN will be available only for ISA-based(e.g., IBM PC XT/AT) computers, but Dukane plans to add NICS that supportIBM'S Micro Channel architecture as well as the EISA bus in many new systems,including Compaq's Systempro.andM;Dukane also said it won't provide a video image scanner at first shipment,but plans to add the capabilities sometime in 1991.andP;  Because TRILAN is amodular system, Schalow emphasized, adding components later will not poseproblems.andM;IBM'S Glitz, GlitterandM;Even if IBM'S products weren't the hit of Interface, its multimedia show was.andO;This isn't to imply that IBM'S booth lacked for foot traffic from thoseinterested in real products-ibmers seemed to have plenty of visitors to keepthem talking.andM;But Big Blue's big show was the center of attention near the conventionentrance, and seating for the 15 minute presentation was usually taken wellahead of showtime.andP;  As one might expect from the likes of IBM, this wastightly choreographed, depending on close timing between the three humanparticipants and the onscreen graphic and midair laser projections.andM;The show began and ended with smoke (or artificial fog) drifting down fromthe booth's rafters.andP;  IBM used the particles in this fog to reflect laserbeams and images, the latter of which were projected from behind the stage.andM;The thrust of the show, titled &quot;IBM Network Management-far Beyond SNA,&quot; wasnetwork management and how IBM'S broad product mix allows managing widelydispersed equipment from a central location.andP;  Suffice it to say that IBMproducts &quot;saved the day.&quot;andM;But that wasn't what most visitors came for: They were waiting for thefinale, in which holographic images were projected onto and reflected off ofsmoke and a fishnet-style curtain.andP;  One remarkable image projected a rapidlymoving cloud mass over the seated audience.andP;  IBM added a globe and geometricshapes circling in midair over the stage, and yes, the letters 1, B, and M,linked in Big Blue's stylized logo, also played a major role in the colorfulfinale.andM;On a more businesslike level, IBM did release a new product, the TokenWay3174 Establishment Co its announcement, Big Blue called its Tokenwaycontroller &quot;an economical new platform for connecting a [LAN) with a hostcomputer.&quot;andM;IBM officials said the Tokenway 3174 controller is an entry-level, low-endproduct designed for use in remote sites that need telecommunication servicesto an IBM SNA-linked central-site host.andP;  Tokenway provides a link between 40nodes on a 4- or 16Mbps Token Ring LAN and the host over a single line.andM;Tokenway also facilitates central site management of the LAN/mainframe linkby giving the host system a direct look at the remote resources connected tothe Tokenway.andP;  Nodes connected to a Tokenway are linked as physical units(Pus), which are directly visible and manageable via IBM'S mainframe-basedNetView network management product, rather than logical units (LUs).andP;  LUs,which are generally allocated and controlled by a gateway device that isitself a PU, are not directly manageable by NetView.andM;The Tokenway 3174 controller, at $5,250, will be available on May 25,according to IBM.andP;  it also requires IBM'S Configuration Support LicensedInternal Code, which costs $257.andP;  Contact IBM at 1133 Westchester Ave., WhitePlains, N.Y., 10604.andM;Just What is Groupware?andM;One of the four dozen or so conferences and tutorials at Interface ostensiblyset out to answer the question, &quot;Multiuser  Software:  Does Groupware Lead toGroup Value?&quot;.andP;  in reality, the session panelists bravely attempted to definegroupware, one of those nebulous buzzwords that PR agents have attached tonumerous network-oriented applications.andM;Panelist Tyrone Pike, president of LANsystems (New York), a vendor ofmultiuser LAN software products, offered this not-so-complex definition:&quot;Groupware is multiuser application software that helps people accomplishcommon tasks.&quot; He further noted that &quot;typical groupware applications providemany-to-many structured communication among users.&quot;andM;This &quot;many-to-many structure allows users equal access to each other's work,[and] equal access gives all members in a group immediate access to eachother's messages as soon as they are entered,&quot; Pike added.andM;He defined electronic mail, document-management programs, online calendars,group databases, and information Research's (Charlottesville, Va.) Syzygy asgroupware products and  excluded  word  processing, spreadsheets, and othersingle-user applications.andM;A second panelist, Nestor Holynskyj, vice president of telecommunicationsplanning for J.P.andP;  Morgan (New York), a large financial institution, admittedthat he believed any multiuser application was groupware.andM;W.E.andP;  (Pete) Peterson, executive vice president of Wordperfect  Provo, Utah),wasn't quite so sold on the idea of groupware.andP;  &quot;Groupware is marketinghype,&quot; he said.andP;  The notion of &quot;groupware somehow asserts that groups arebetter than other units.&quot; He cautioned, &quot;Don't assume that groupware isgood.&quot;andM;Holynskyj provided one of the more intriguing mental images during thesession when he alluded to a hypothetical multiuser version of Wordperfect, aword processing program.andP;  imagine how you'd feel if, while revising oneparagraph in a document, you could see the changes a co-worker was making onanother paragraph above or below the one you're working on.andP;  it would bedisconcerting, at the very least, to see the letters within words andsentences being replaced one by one.andP;  Not only would this in all likelihoodchange the context of the document, it might render any revisions you weremaking nonsensical.andM;Increasing ThroughputandM;Kalpana, a small Campbell, Calif., connectivity products manufacturer, claimsits newly released Etherswitch packet-switch bridge can increase Ethernet'sdata throughput &quot;up to tens or even hundreds of times.&quot; Company officials saytheir Etherswitch, which replaces a standard bridge in an Ethernet network,increases Ethernet's throughput by allowing the network to transport multiplepackets simultaneously without collisions.andM;The modular Etherswitch does this via what Kalpana calls circuit switching ona per-packet basis.andP;  Etherswitch eliminates much of the propagation delayimposed by the bridging process.andM;Rather than processing an entire Ethernet packet, as standard bridges do,Etherswitch verifies a packet's destination from the six-byte address in thepacket header and immediately forwards it to the appropriate port on theEtherswitch.andP;  This process, says Kalpana, shortens the time delay betweenreception and retransmission of the bridge from 800 to about 40 MS.andM;This on-the-fly routing is managed by a routing table that reads the sourceinformation in packet headers and dynamically updates the table byeliminating inactive source addresses and adding new ones as needed.andP;  Theseperformance characteristics allow operating an Etherswitch as a multiportbridge, a backbone traffic concentrator, a twisted-pair Ethernetconcentrator, or a high-speed front end to a file server.andP;  The Etherswitchretails from $4,995 for a two-port version to $9,995 for a seven-port model.andM;Comten Adds OSI ModuleandM;NCR Comten (St.andP;  Paul, Minn.) announced an Open Systems Interconnect (OSI)option to its front-end processors, thus providing a means of running OSIapplications over an IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA) backbone networkin parallel with Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol  TCP/IP)data.andP;  The option, a module the NCR subsidiary called its Open SystemsInterconnection/communications Processor  (OSI/CP), should help consolidatethe company's OSI, SNA, and TCP/IP networks.andP;  OSI/CP operates with the Comten56X5 family of communications processors, which support Token Ring andEthernet LANS.andM;The products in tandem allow users with OSI-based desktop applications suchas file transfer and electronic mail to interoperate over a WAN independentlyof the mainframe.andP;  Comten's OSI/CP allows users to integrate Ethernet LANSinto their SNA networks without using bridges or gateways.andP;  A directconnection on an NCR Comten communications processor accomplishes thisintegration.andM;The major market for the product appears to be the federal government, whichhas mandated that all networking products purchased after August comply withits Government OSI Profile (GOSIP) standards.andM;OSI/CP will be available in the fourth quarter for an initial licensing feeof $7,000, with a continuing monthly licensing fee of $200.andM;Revving Up ArcnetandM;Finally, Datapoint (San Antonio, Texas) used Interface to announce firstdelivery of its 20Mbps Arcnet Development Kit, which allows developers toestablish prototype 20Mbps Arcnet plus networks without waiting forproduction Arcnetplus chips.andM;The kit, which includes two 20 Mbps Arcnetplus network interface boards,technical documentation, a variety of connectivity components, aNetbios-compatible Datalan PC NOS, and software designed to help developers,also allows users to design products that optimize the performance ofArcnetplus networks.andM;According to Datapoint engineering director Robert Hollingsworth, tests withprototype Arcnetplus kits have shown the 20 mbps protocol delivers up to sixtimes the throughput of standard 2.5Mbps Arcnet.andM;Production chips based on the Arcnetplus technology are said to be underdevelopment  by Standard Microsystems and NCR'S microelectronics division;this effort is the result of an alliance formed by SMC and NCR withDatapoint.andP;  They are expected to be available later this year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
