The Justice Department is pursuing a criminalinvestigation of an American Cyanamid official believed tohave altered research results on new veterinary drugs, whilethe FDA explores whether top management was aware of hisactivities, according to government officials. The agency hassuspended the Wayne, N.J., company's new animal-drugapplications -- 30 in all, including its bid to market agenetically engineered bovine growth hormone -- pending theoutcome of a comprehensive audit to assess the veracity ofAmerican Cyanamid research data.</LP><TEXT>   The company has voluntarily removed two poultry drugs fromthe U.S. market and is cooperating with FDA investigators, anAmerican Cyanamid spokeswoman said. Also, it has produceddocuments &quot;in response to a grand jury subpoena.&quot;   The case is seen here as reinforcing findings of GeneralAccounting Office investigators, who have concluded that theFDA is incapable of detecting fraudulent data in new animaldrug applications. At the same time, the investigation ofAmerican Cyanamid, coming on the heels of the 1989-90generic-drug scandal and recent fraud allegations involvingthe sleeping pill Halcion and silicone gel breast implants,throws into question the FDA's historic trust in the reams ofraw scientific data underlying all new product applications,including those for human drugs.   &quot;The GAO findings are profoundly disturbing,&quot; assertedRep. Ted Weiss. &quot;How many drug manufacturers are willing togamble that FDA will never catch them?&quot;   The New York Democrat has asked the GAO, the audit arm ofCongress, to conduct a similar investigation of the FDA'sdata-monitoring program for human drugs because of thesimilarities in animal and human drug-approval procedures.   When it comes to animal drugs, failure to detect fudged orfabricated data could have serious health effects, becausedrug residues accumulate in the milk and meat from treatedanimals. An estimated 80% of the nation's livestock andpoultry are treated with antibiotics and other drugs beforethey are slaughtered for market.   At the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, officials aremostly preoccupied with ensuring that companies haveexercised sound scientific judgment in deciding on the safetyand efficacy of a drug and that they have furnished enoughdata to justify labeling claims.   FDA officials, it turns out, had no inkling of possiblewrongdoing at American Cyanamid until the head of anindependent laboratory under contract to the company informedthe agency in 1990 that he had been pressured by a companyofficial to alter data.   The American Cyanamid official had been involved in thetesting of seven new animal drugs, including Cygro, amedicine used world-wide to treat a parasitic disease inchickens, government officials said. He is suspected ofaltering test results to make drugs appear more effectivethan the tests showed. He isn't believed to have altered anysafety data.   The company, which rang up animal drug and agrichemicalsales of $1.2 billion in 1991, has been conducting its owninternal inquiry since August 1990, the company spokeswomansaid.   &quot;We have been cooperating with the investigations beingconducted by the FDA and an independent audit team,&quot; shesaid. The agency and the Justice Department already have beenprovided with the audit team's draft report, which focusesprimarily on the validity of studies done &quot;at onecontractor's site.&quot;   But all of the company's new animal drug applications,including its version of bovine growth hormone, or BGH, areexpected to remain in regulatory limbo, perhaps until early1993, pending the agency's review of the final audit report.American Cyanamid and three corporate rivals -- Monsanto Co.,Eli Lilly andamp; Co. and Upjohn Co. -- have invested heavily inBGH research and development in anticipation of a $500million annual market for the synthetic hormone, which boostsmilk production in cows.   The FDA became much warier about corporate chicanery in1989 after investigators, led by a House oversight panelchaired by Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), caught generic-drugmakers in a variety of scientific deceptions, includingpassing off test results on brand-name drugs as their own.Under Commissioner David Kessler, the agency has beguninstalling safeguards to prevent another such scandal.   &quot;Our No. 1 priority has been to ensure the integrity ofscientific data,&quot; Dr. Kessler said. &quot;We're putting money intoit.&quot;   The Center for Veterinary Medicine, for one, has steppedup inspections at research labs and farms while new animaldrugs are being tested for safety and effectiveness. But theGAO report, released Friday by Rep. Weiss, highlights severalshortcomings in the agency's inspection system.   FDA data reviewers lack experience and training in thedetection of data discrepancies, the report said. They oftenconduct their inspections after the original data have beendiscarded and the test animals slaughtered. What's more, theagency's enforcement activities have been hamstrung by itsown failure to issue compliance regulations, the report said.   Gerald Guest, director of the Center for VeterinaryMedicine, said that these regulations are being prepared.Among other things, companies would be required to notify theagency of their drug-testing schedules. This would allow theagency to time its inspections better.</TEXT></DOC>
