The result is a far less aggressive approach to asbestos in the nation's office, government and apartment buildings than in its schools. The EPA's latest action quickly drew fire from Capitol Hill.    By federal law, public and private schools must inspect their buildings by Oct. 12 for any materials containing asbestos, which can cause lung cancer and other diseases, and draw up maintenance or cleanup programs. Congress left the issue of asbestos in other publicly used buildings to the EPA.    In its report to Congress, the EPA yesterday said it would cost $51 billion -- 17 times the school program -- if a nationwide inspection and cleanup program were required for some 3.6 million commercial and public buildings. Before taking that plunge, the EPA recommended instead a three-year program of further study and beefed-up training for asbestos inspectors and removal crews.    &quot;We've got finite resources,&quot; John Moore, head of the EPA's toxic substances division, told reporters. For now, the EPA needs to keep the primary focus on schools, he said, because children are at greater risk from the long-term effects of inhaling asbestos fibers and because schools have worse asbestos problems than other buildings.    While roughly one-third of U.S. schools have asbestos problems, the EPA estimated that 20% of commercial and public buildings contain asbestos materials in a potentially hazardous form that can crumble on touch, sending up airborne fibers. The agency estimated that asbestos in some 14% of the buildings is damaged -- meaning it is more likely that fibers have been released -- and in 9% is significantly damaged.    The most commonly found problem was with thermal insulation, fire-retardant asbestos that was wrapped around pipes and heat ducts from roughly the 1920s through the 1960s. Since most thermal insulation is found in boiler and machinery rooms, building and service workers are more at risk than the public, Mr. Moore said.    Mr. Moore stressed that the mere presence of asbestos isn't necessarily a health risk. It depends on its condition and the exposure levels, he said. &quot;There's nothing to suggest there are terrible conditions out there&quot; in tremendous numbers, he said.    Some problems can be inexpensively and quickly contained, he said. He also stressed that removal, which is costly, isn't always the best alternative because it releases more fibers into the air.    Congress has introduced -- but not passed -- bills to tackle asbestos problems in federal buildings. Democratic Rep. James Florio of New Jersey, who sponsored the 1986 law mandating school asbestos inspections, promptly blasted the EPA's recommendations yesterday for &quot;sweeping this alarming problem under the rug&quot; and said he will consider introducing more aggressive legislation.    The Service Employees International Union, representing more than 150,000 building-service workers, also criticized the EPA for not even requiring that building owners inspect for asbestos and inform workers when it is found.    A group of former makers of asbestos products also challenged the EPA's estimates, which were based on inspections of only 231 buildings. John Welch, president of the Safe Buildings Alliance, said the EPA should set health standards for asbestos, as it does for radon and other contaminants, so that building owners and tenants can have an objective way to measure whether removal is required or a building is safe. </TEXT></DOC>
