Skinner said at a newsconference in front of a boat on which more than six tons ofcocaine was found.   Drug cartels used to keep large stockpiles of cocaine inColombia and move it gradually to the United States, he said, butthey're now moving it in huge lots.   ``That's because of the pressure from the government inColombia,'' he said. Colombia has cracked down heavily on drugtraffickers since a leading presidential candidate was assassinatedAug. 18.   Skinner spoke in front of the Zedom Sea, a rusty, dented185-foot offshore supply boat turned freighter. The Coast Guardseized the boat Monday in the Gulf of Mexico, then handed over thecargo and the crew of nine Colombians _ eight men and a woman _Thursday to the Drug Enforcement Administration.   The nine were arraigned later on charges of importing cocaineand possession with intent to distribute cocaine. U.S. MagistrateAlma Chasez ordered each held without bond and appointed a publicdefender to represent them.   If convicted of the charges, they could be sentenced to lifeimprisonment.   ``We will throw the book at them,'' said U.S. Attorney JohnVolz. ``We will try to get as much prison time as we can.''   Also Thursday, DEA spokesman Billy Fernandes said cocaine foundaboard the Zedom Sea, originally estimated at 11,500 pounds,actually totaled 12,208 pounds and had a street value of nearly$554.9 million.   The cocaine on the Zedom Sea was one of four major finds in lessthan a week.   Texas state troopers found nine tons of the drug Wednesday inHarlingen, stacked in a house believed to be a center forrepackaging cocaine after its arrival in the United States. ThreeMexicans were arraigned Thursday on charges of engaging inorganized criminal activity and aggravated cocaine possession.   About 20 tons was found late last week in a Los Angeleswarehouse in what was described as the largest haul ever. And theCoast Guard seized about 1{ tons near Puerto Rico over the weekend.   ``It is not business as usual in the drug business today ...,''said Skinner. ``The efforts in Colombia ... are creating what I'dcall chaos. And we're taking advantage of that, and we're seizingcocaine that otherwise would have been transmitted in smallergroups and probably would not have been detected.''   In addition, he said, the various U.S. government agencies thatfight the drug trade are far more cooperative than they used to be.   ``The turf fighting that I used to see many years ago, I don'tsee now,'' he said.   With the Gulf of Mexico and Puerto Rican seizures, the CoastGuard's total take in the first four days of fiscal year 1990 ismore than that of all that the Coast Guard seized the previousfiscal year, officials said. Federal fiscal years begin Oct. 1.   And there may well be more on the Zedom Sea, said Ruben Monzon,special agent in charge of the DEA's New Orleans office.   The cocaine was found in two of 10 boxcar-size freightcontainers stacked on the deck, but the Coast Guard was able tosearch only the containers on top. DEA agents planned to search theothers, he said.   The Zedom Sea was heading west from the Yucatan Peninsula whenthe crew of the cutter Cushing boarded it.   It's likely that the ship was on a route known as the``Trampoline,'' from Colombia to Mexico, and from there toCalifornia or west Texas, said Monzon.   The route is being used more these days because stepped-uppatrols in Florida and along the Mexican border have increased thedanger of smuggling along more direct routes, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
