Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seized controlThursday of 38 more Sandamp;Ls at or near insolvency, raising to 215 thenumber of troubled thrifts that the agency has put intoconservatorships since early February in an effort to prevent thebailout costs from mushrooming.   On a bipartisan vote, the House Banking subcommittee onfinancial institutions moved immediately to deny Bush some of thecontrols he had sought over officials running the government'sdeposit insurance program.   The subcommittee also amended Bush's proposal by transferringregulatory oversight of state-chartered but federally insured Sandamp;Lsfrom the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to the Federal DepositInsurance Corp.   Bush in February proposed transferring authority over federallychartered thrifts from the bank board to the FDIC, which regulatescommercial banks.   But the committee rejected an amendment by Democratic Rep.Richard Lehman to allow 31 of the nation's largest thrifts, many ofthem in his home state of California, to become banks and escapefuture insurance liability for the costs of the Sandamp;L bailout.   The panel also balked temporarily at an effort by Rep. DougBarnard Jr., D-Ga., to prevent the government from recovering someof the billions of dollars in long-term aid it committed last yearto buyers of 179 insolvent thrifts.   Subcommittee members also questioned the legality of many oflast year's bailouts, saying the bank board had committed billionsof dollars Congress had not authorized it to spend.   Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas., saidsome of those deals were with multimillionaires who put up littleor none of their own money.   In one December transaction, government aid exceeded the nearly$6 billion combined costs of the 1970s bailouts of New York Cityand the Lockheed Corp. and the 1980 bailout of Chrysler Corp.,according to auditors.   Barnard, in the face of strong opposition, temporarily withdrewhis amendment to prevent the government from seeking to recoverfrom holding companies some of the subsidies the FSLIC had promisedto Sandamp;L purchasers.   But he complained that ``all of a sudden we are weaseling oncommitments that were made.''   In all the subcommittee has before it 165 proposed amendments tothe administration's proposal.   The bank board, meanwhile, released figures showing thatdepositors removed $9.4 billion from the Sandamp;Ls in February, thefourth straight month of heavy withdrawals.   The nation's 2,939 thrifts hold $957 billion in deposits.Withdrawals since October total $35.4 billion.   January's withdrawals amounted to $10.6 billion, according torevised figures. Bank board officials attributed the Februaryslowdown in the outflow to higher interest rates being offered bymany Sandamp;Ls.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady has said he expects thewithdrawals to stop if Congress approves Bush's bailout plan,estimated to cost at least $157 billion and, perhaps, more than$200 billion over the next 10 years, depending on economicconditions.   The subcommittee adopted by voice vote an amendment providingfour-year terms to the chairman and vice chairman of the FDIC,which under Bush's plan would take over insuring Sandamp;L deposits fromthe bank board's insolvent Federal and Savings and Loan InsuranceCorp. (FSLIC).   Currently, the chairman of the FDIC _ now William Seidman _ ischosen by its other two board members. Bush wanted to have thechairman report to the secretary of the treasury, who could hireand fire the chairman at will.   ``A lot of the problem (in) where we are now is the lack ofindependence by regulatory agencies,'' said Rep. Peter Hoagland,D-Neb., one of the sponsors of the amendment.   Bush also would leave the bank board and its chairman, M. DannyWall, as the primary federal regulators of state-chartered Sandamp;Ls.But, in an indication of disappointment with the way Wall has donehis job, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, won a 35-12 vote on his amendmentto transfer that power to the FDIC.   Lehman's amendment to exempt the 31 large Sandamp;Ls from aBush-proposed five-year moratorium on leaving the thrift insurancefund to escape the higher premiums it charges in relation to whatbanks pay for deposit coverage was defeated on a 28-17 vote.   ``If you let those folks out, you are telling the taxpayers backhome you want them to pay more of the burden,'' said Rep. GeraldKleczka, D-Wis., who noted that the 31 thrifts hold aboutone-fourth of all Sandamp;L deposits in the country.   The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., plansto complete the bill next week and then send it to the fullcommittee, where Gonzalez has indicated he may give it lengthyconsideration.   All but four members of the full committee serve on thesubcommittee.   In the Senate, the legislation appears to moving at a fasterpace, although so far it all has been dealt with only in closedsessions in anticipation of formal open meetings next week.   There, the Banking Committee chairman, Sen. Donald W. RiegleJr., D-Mich., told colleagues that Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine, intends to have the Senate vote on the bill during theweek of April 17.   The Senate panel is scheduled to begin amending Bush's packagenext Tuesday and Wednesday, when Annunzio's House subcommittee willresume its deliberations.   In other action on amendments Thursday, the House panel:   _Rejected on a 39-7 vote a measure by Reps. Paul E. Kanjorski,D-Pa., and Marcy Kaptur, D-Pa., aimed at making states where muchof the problems have occurred _ chiefly Texas and Florida _ raisestate taxes to pay 20 percent of the bailout costs forstate-chartered thrifts that went belly up.   Kaptur blamed loose regulations in those states for 74 percentof the Sandamp;L aid committed by the government last year, saying thecosts of bailing out Texas institutions alone will total threetimes what the United States spent on the Marshall plan inrebuilding Europe after World War II.   But Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said the amendment would havesent the bill to ``Fort Sumter and started a second civil war.''And, referring to Bush, Leach questioned whether ``there is aslight chance that a Texan in the White House could sign'' the billwith such a provision.   _Approved on a voice vote a compromise worked out with lobbyistsfor bankers and thrifts a measure that will allow both federallyinsured banks and Sandamp;Ls to use the same insurance logo but withdifferent names.   _Defeated a measure aimed at preventing banks from citing thepoor condition of the Sandamp;L insurance pool in their advertisements tolure deposits from thrifts.   _Defeated an amendment by Barnard that would have ordered theFDIC to increase the pay of bank and Sandamp;L examiners by 20 percent atan annual cost of $14 million. Barnard said those examiners areleaving those jobs at rate of 12 percent a year because theirannual pay averages less than $40,000.</TEXT></DOC>
