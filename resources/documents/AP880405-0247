Members of the United Auto Workers union's 140-member nationalChrysler council were to begin arriving in Kansas City, Mo., todayfor a meeting with national UAW leaders and elected unionbargainers.   By Friday, the council planned to have discussed and approveddemands that will guide how the industry pattern contract,established at the two larger companies, can be installed at thesmallest Big Three automaker.   The Chrysler contract, covering 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-offworkers, expires Sept. 14. Talks are scheduled to begin April 18,instead of mid-July as usual.   The two sides agreed to early talks to stem damage inflicted byfriction over Chrysler's closing of an assembly plant in Kenosha,Wis., and the abortive sale of its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. partssubsidiary.   Chrysler was stunned by the speed and severity of the union'sopposition to the proposed Acustar sale. Angry workers at localsacross the nation began preparing ``strike packages'' _ lists ofgrievances over locally strikeable issues _ and stopped cooperatingin crucial management-union programs aimed at improving quality andproduction efficiency.   UAW Vice President Marc Stepp, who will lead negotiations withChrysler, told workers at the time that he would give local unionswith grievances permission to strike immediately.   A few strikes at key assembly and parts plants could havecrippled Chrysler as quickly as a national strike.   Chrysler quickly backed down from the proposed sale in earlyMarch and agreed to early contract talks, a request it had refusedlast fall after the union wrapped up contracts at Ford and GM.   Negotiators on both sides are limited to working within thepattern contract, which forbids layoffs except during decliningsales of a particular product and requires automakers to continuepaying workers whose jobs are lost to productivity improvements,new technology or transfer of work to outside suppliers.   The pattern contract also includes joint six-month,plant-by-plant studies that will examine ways to strengthenoperations and keep work inside each company. The UAW hopes thestudies will make it harder for automakers to pit plant againstplant in competition for a shrinking number of jobs.   The UAW is expected to seek a two-year contract instead of theusual three-year pact so that its contracts with all Big Threemakers will expire together in 1990.   The union also will seek more representation on the Chryslerboard of directors. UAW President Owen Bieber has a board seat, butthe union believes holding more seats will give it more controlover Chrysler decisions.   Bargainers will work against an artificial target deadlineinstead of a strike deadline, so Chrysler faces no risk of acompanywide strike if talks fail. Industry analysts expect a quicksettlement.   But a failure at the table would sour relations and make talksmore difficult when the two sides were forced to resume bargainingin the summer.</TEXT></DOC>
