<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-83-0042 </DOCNO><TEXT>The polarisation properties of the single mode linearly polarised laserbeam interaction with a Doppler broadened absorber has been investigated.The absorber is placed in a longitudinal tunable magnetic field. Thelaser beam is analysed with a polariser after it has traversed the absorber.With various analyser rotation angles the lineshapes of the nonlinearresonances known as the population effect and the Zeeman coherence effecthave been studied near zero magnetic field tuning. Theoretical predictionsderived from the semiclassical laser theory are compared with experimentalresults. The experiment has been carried out with a low power thermallystabilised 633 nm He-He laser. The measured lineshapes of the resonancesof the 2p/sub 4/-3s/sub 2/ transition in neon agree well with the theoreticalpredictions. By using an analyser in the beam an improved signal-to-noiseratio is shown to result.</TEXT></DOC>
