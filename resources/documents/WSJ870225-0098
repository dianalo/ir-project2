The justices ruled 9-0 that requiring Asahi Metal Industry Co. to face a trial in California would &quot;offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice&quot; required by the Constitution's guarantee of due process.    But the divided justices failed in trying to set a standard for the amount of contact that must exist between a foreign defendant and a state in order to make state court jurisdiction proper.    The ruling involves the area that, although technical, is important in determining where lawsuits may be brought, and where companies and other defendants may be forced to defend themselves.    In a long line of decisions, the Supreme Court has said there must be &quot;minimum contacts&quot; between a company and a state before the company can be sued in that state. Yesterday, the justices were split over whether sufficient contact is established when a company puts its goods in a foreign market, knowing that some of the merchandise may end up in the U.S. or in a specific state, such as California.    The lawsuit against Asahi Metal began in 1978 when a man was injured and his wife killed after he lost control of his motorcycle and collided with a tractor on an interstate highway in California.    A lawsuit was originally filed against Cheng Shin Rubber Industrial Co., the Taiwanese manufacturer of the motorcycle's tire tube. That suit was eventually settled. But Cheng Shin, meanwhile, filed a complaint against Asahi Metal, maker of the cycle's valve assembly, and this complaint remained active after the earlier case was settled.    Asahi Metal objected that it doesn't do business in California and has no office there. But the California Supreme Court said the case could proceed because Asahi put the valves on the market, knowing that Cheng Shin would use some of the valves in California.    In an opinion written by Justice Sandra O'Connor, the high court concluded unanimously that regardless of whether &quot;minimum contacts&quot; existed between Asahi Metal and California, other factors weighed against the suit's being handled in the U.S. These factors were the inconvenience to Asahi Metal of defending itself in California, the interests of the goverments of Japan and Taiwan in their own courts, and the absence of a stake in the case for California.    But Justice O'Connor, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Lewis Powell and Antonin Scalia, also suggested in her opinion that even without these other factors, Asahi Metal couldn't be sued in California because by placing the valves on the market, it wasn't intending to transact any business involving California.    Justice William Brennan, joined by Justices Byron White, Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun, disagreed on this point, saying that since Asahi Metal knew its valves were being marketed in California, a lawsuit couldn't &quot;come as a surprise.&quot; They said that putting the goods in the open market, knowing that some are sold in California, establishes sufficient contact to be sued there.    Justice John Stevens, in a separate opinion, said that because the other factors resolved the issue, a decision on a standard for sufficient contacts was unnecessary in this case.    Broad business interest in the case is demonstrated by a friend-of-the-court brief filed by the Confederation of British Industry in supporting Asahi.    Penalty for Appeals   The justices sidestepped the important question of whether it is constitutional for states to penalize defendants who unsuccessfully appeal court money awards against them.    Alabama is one of several Southern states that impose such penalties. In the Supreme Court case, Burlington Northern Railroad Co., a Burlington Northern Inc. unit, was ordered by a federal court jury to pay $305,000 to a couple injured in a motorcycle accident. The couple said the road surface was defective because of Burlington Northern railroad tracks in the road.    When the award was upheld by a federal appeals court in Atlanta in 1985, the injured persons also urged that Alabama's 10% penalty on unsuccessful appeals be applied. The appeals court agreed.    Although no federal issue was involved in the personal injury case, it was filed in federal court under a federal law that permits state-law issues to be handled in federal court when the dispute is between persons or companies from different states.    The Supreme Court yesterday, in a unanimous decision written by Justice Marshall, said the Alabama penalty doesn't apply when the suit is filed in federal, rather than in state court. As a result, the justices took no position on whether the penalty may violate the 14th Amendment guarantees of &quot;equal protection&quot; and &quot;due process.&quot;    State Airplane Tax   The justices unanimously upheld a South Dakota property tax on the value of airplanes. Four airlines challenged the South Dakota tax, saying it wasn't imposed on other personal property and, therefore, discriminated against them.    But the high court, in an opinion written by Justice O'Connor, said the tax isn't prohibited by a 1982 federal law that bars taxes that discriminate against airlines. </TEXT></DOC>
