TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The commander of Israel's air force saidMonday that Israel was concerned about the reported introduction ofsurface-to-surface missiles in Lebanon, saying it could trigger adangerous new arms race.   Lebanese military sources in April reported Iraq gave six Frog-7missiles to Christian forces as a deterrent against Syria, which hasbeen bombarding Beirut with as many as 400 shells daily.   The Soviet-designed missiles can carry a warhead of 1,200 poundsfor more than 40 miles, enough to reach Damascus from Beirut.   Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun said he was unable to confirm that Frogmissiles were in the hands of Christian militias. But he said evenif they were, Israel would not intervene at this stage.   ``We have so many problems around our own borders let us notintervene in such a mess over there, as well,'' he said.   However, the air force commander said there was concern that ifthe Christians got such a weapons system other militias wouldacquire them as well, ultimately posing a threat to Israel thatcould prompt pre-emptive action.   ``We are worried about Frog missiles in Lebanon because we areworried about the arms race that will start up there,'' he toldreporters at Israel Air Force headquarters in Tel Aviv.   ``We are not worried about the Christians launching them againstus. We are worried that if the Christians have them then the Shiiteswould like to have them and the PLO would like to have them. Thenwe'll have some that might be pointed against us.''   Such an arms race, he said, could lead to ``a point where we willhave to intervene if they get into the hands of those who mightlaunch them against us.''   Bin-Nun noted Syria had mounted a naval blockade of Christianharbors in Lebanon to prevent missiles being shipped from Iraq,which is an arch rival of Syria.   There has been no official comment, but Israeli commentators haveexpressed growing concern that an Israel-Syria naval or air clashcould occur in Lebanon even though the two countries have a sharedinterest in keeping Iraqi missiles out of Beirut.   Saying a clash could result if the Israeli navy's freedom ofaction was restricted, the Maariv newspaper said in an editoriallast week ``this is a dangerous and sensitive political and militarysituation that compells the Israeli government to take a stand, andperhaps action.''   Bin-Nun, 48, an ex-fighter pilot who fought in the 1967 and 1973Middle East wars, defended Israeli air raids in Lebanon which oftenresult in civilian casualties.   ``If we had not hit (PLO bases) then we would have them much moreoften on our northern border,'' Bin-Nun said.   He said the air force never operated on the basis of a singleintelligence source in selecting a target and that several agencieshad to approve each strike. Also, he added, a final OK was obtained``from the highest possible level'' _ presumably the prime ministeror defense minister.   In addition, pilots risked their lives and aircraft by flying lowand limited the number of bombs they dropped so that the possibiltyof hitting civilians would be lessened.   ``I believe that no air force that I know in the world would havetaken so many precautions against hitting civilians,'' he said.   ``We are really very sorry about every one who is being injuredor who dies in any attack who is innocent. But they (guerrillas) usethe civilians to hide behind, and we cannot stop fighting thembecause of that,'' Bin-Nun said.   In eight air raids this year, most against PLO targets, Israeliforces killed eight people and wounded 67, according to reports fromLebanon. In 1988, 128 people died and 356 were wounded in 25 airraids. Some victims were civilians but no breakdown was available.</TEXT></DOC>
