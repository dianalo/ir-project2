He slipped into a press conference last summer during the Moscow Film Festival and made a scene. Just as Elem Klimov, the much-admired president of the reorganized Film Maker's Union, was assuring a journalist that all the previously banned films were now &quot;off the shelf,&quot; Mr. Askoldov stood and begged to differ. He held up the union's constitution, reminded the luminaries of the Soviet film industry that it &quot;guaranteed the right of any director within the walls of this establishment to show any picture and to discuss it within a professional atmosphere,&quot; and demanded that his only picture, &quot;Commissar,&quot; be screened at long last.    The authorities had little choice then but to satisfy Mr. Askoldov's demand that the film be shown. In the same hall in which 20 years earlier Mr. Askoldov had been excluded from the Communist Party, &quot;Commissar&quot; finally received an audience. The 500 people present stood in ovation at the film's conclusion.    Since then, Mr. Askoldov has been able to exhibit it in Europe and, recently, at the San Francisco Film Festival. And he has been promised that &quot;Commissar&quot; will be released in Soviet theaters this fall. If this sounds like justice triumphant, Mr. Askoldov's future, nonetheless, remains uncertain. &quot;At the festival in West Berlin there was press coverage from all over the world for my film -- radio, television and print -- from a huge number of countries. From everywhere except the Soviet Union. In the newspaper Soviet Culture there was a report on the festival where I counted the names of over 50 movie directors. One name was actually left out. The name of Askoldov, who took four prizes at the festival. Pravda has yet to print a word about it.&quot;    &quot;Commissar&quot; evidently still has not come out of the dark cloud that settled over it even while Mr. Askoldov was editing the film in 1967. That was the year of Israel's victory in the Six-Day War against Egypt. The coincidence was fatal to &quot;Commissar&quot; because Mr. Askoldov's film is about a pregnant Red Army commissar billeted with a poor Jewish family during the post-1917 Civil War. &quot;Commissar&quot; offers a richly detailed, sympathetic portrait of the Jewish family, the Magazaniks. But in one scene, the commissar foresees the Nazis and the Holocaust. In her vision, the Magazaniks are led to the gas chamber. All this struck orthodox Soviet observers as suggesting a connection between Nazism and Russian anti-Semitism and to Stalin's appeasement of Hitler. Soviet censors accused Mr. Askoldov of promoting both Zionism and &quot;imperialistic chauvinism&quot; (Soviet doublespeak for pro-Slavism). The film was banned and Mr. Askoldov was even told that it had been burned.    It was then that Mr. Askoldov made, perhaps, his most tragic mistake. He had previously alienated the Writers' Union with his research on the then-suppressed anti-Stalinist novelist Mikhail Bulgakov. Now he protested directly against the suppression of his own work. He wrote letters to the authorities &quot;saying that the destruction of works of art was barbaric, inhuman, impermissible.&quot; Shortly thereafter Mr. Askoldov was dismissed from the studio as &quot;professionally incapable.&quot; The injustice of such a charge is painful, as Mr. Askoldov's film brilliantly and luminously reanimates the traditions of the great early Soviet film makers Sergei Eisenstein and, in particular, V.I. Pudovkin. Though he was later assigned two documentaries, his approach apparently was disturbing enough to the authorities that these films also disappeared.    &quot;As I had to earn a living I was able to find some work in the musical theater,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Along with some interesting can-cans I staged several experimental pieces which the critics considered innovative, but the bureaucracy destroyed these pieces as well and for the second time I was dismissed with the label 'professionally inadequate.'&quot; In fact, the only work of his own creation that Mr. Askoldov has been allowed to hold on to is, literally, his furniture.    Despite such injustices and his father's death at the hands of Stalin in 1937, Mr. Askoldov remains not only undaunted but devoted to what he terms &quot;the morality of the Russian Revolution.&quot; Passionately he repeats again and again, &quot;I am a believer, the revolution is my religion.&quot;    Keeping in mind the manipulative aspects of glasnost, it is just possible that we are witnessing a new and improved form of exile in which the wronged Soviet is trotted out for Western consumption but remains relatively unknown to his own people. The promised domestic release of &quot;Commissar&quot; in September could mean as little as one screening in one theater in one remote town. And, once more, the times themselves seem to conspire against Mr. Askoldov. The current struggle over the Nagorno-Karabakh region between the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis makes the wide release of a film sympathetic to ethnics unlikely.    Though Mr. Askoldov is a committed supporter of Mikhail Gorbachev and his policy of restructuring, he continues to rage. In sudden, brief outbursts, when I met him in California, it tumbled forth: &quot;I often have the feeling that what is happening in my country is being distorted in the Western press. The idea that art and spirituality in Russia have been smothered by the bureaucracy alone is a particular danger one might fall into. Alone bureaucracy would be incapable of doing such a thing. The cooperation of strikebreakers and immoral people among the intelligentsia was required as well. That's where the essential tragic contradiction of our internal situation lies.    &quot;It stupefies me that after 2 1/2 years of perestroika not a single deep, authentic, intellectual film has been shot in the Soviet Union. Sure, you can do as much reconstruction as you like. You can buy nice film, you can cooperate with Hollywood, but if you don't have anything inside you, then nothing will happen. So many directors are traveling to America, but they don't have any ideas. They're coming here because they're running around shopping!&quot;    When asked about future films, Mr. Askoldov made it clear that he has, as of yet, no assignments, and then continued, &quot;I would do a philosophical film about my feelings on perestroika. Ten years after they shelved the film and tried to burn it, it was shown behind closed doors in Goskino for some kind of bureaucratic higherups. I found out about it, went there, entered the hall, they saw me, took me by the scruff of the neck, and shoved me out the door. I said, 'Why? It's my film. I want to see it.' They told me, quite seriously, that it was a very harmful film and that I shouldn't see it another, unnecessary time. This episode could be a kind of tragicomic frame for the entire picture.    &quot;No one else will shoot a film like this, only I can.&quot;    ---   Ms. Williamson, who is based in Monterey, Calif., writes frequently about the arts in the Soviet Union. </TEXT></DOC>
