This ban was continued under the interim final rule on yellowfintuna imports published March 7, 1989. Although El Salvador still has notprovided the information required from nations which have purse seine vesselsof greater than 400 tons carrying capacity fishing for tuna in the EPT,NOAA has determined that the last purse seine vessel of that size underEl Salvador's flag in the EPT has been sold and transferred to the flagof Panama. The Republic of Panama currently has a finding of conformanceunder the U.S. marine mammal protection regulations.Therefore, El Salvador no longer need meet the requirements for an ETPharvesting nation to have its yellowfin tuna imported into the United States.The ban on importation of yellowfin tuna from El Salvador is rescinded.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
