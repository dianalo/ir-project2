In recent rulings, the Supreme Court has required a transit authority in Texas to meet federal wage-and-hour standards for workers, struck down a Wisconsin law that barred from state contracts companies that violated labor laws, upheld broad federal regulation of strip mining in the states, and even invalidated a divorce decree in Maine involving a serviceman's military life insurance.    Such cases are examples of how, 200 years after the Constitution was written, the debate over federal versus state power is still going on. The Reagan administration contends that the Supreme Court and Congress have &quot;usurped&quot; the original power of the states, undermining the very idea of a federalism with shared authority.    &quot;The Framers' vision of a limited national government . . . has gradually given way to a national government with virtually unlimited power to direct the public policy choices of the states,&quot; declares an administration task force led by Charles Cooper, an assistant attorney general. Changes in constitutional law, the task force reported, are &quot;the principal cause of federalism's decline.&quot;    Some legal experts, though, question the administration's commitment to restoring state power. &quot;Dedication to federalism has been a sometime thing in this administration,&quot; says A.E. Dick Howard, a professor at the University of Virginia Law School. &quot;Federalism has been abandoned when inconvenient,&quot; he says, adding that other administrations also &quot;have been inconsistent.&quot;    The growth of the federal government, many experts say, is primarily a response to rapid change and vast economic expansion in the U.S., and they point to broad language in the Constitution intended to permit federal powers to expand with demand.    &quot;I wouldn't say it's usurpation,&quot; says James MacGregor Burns, a Williams College political scientist and historian. The balance of power between the state and federal governments, he says, &quot;is very much decided by complex forces.&quot;    The debate may sound like political theory, but it shapes real-life issues.    Congress, the Justice Department's Mr. Cooper recently wrote, &quot;tells the states the age at which they may retire their law enforcement officers, prescribes the regulatory agenda that their public utilities must follow and controls the wages and hours of their employees.&quot; The Supreme Court, he said, has upheld &quot;these and other federal encroachments on the . . . states.&quot;    Critics say, however, that the Reagan administration hasn't any compunction about opposing state authority that runs counter to its policies. They cite recent Supreme Court cases in which the administration argued against an Indiana law regulating corporate takeovers on the grounds that it interfered with interstate commerce and opposed a Maine law requiring employers that close factories to provide severance pay as clashing with a federal law. The high court upheld both state laws.    When the validity of a federal law is questioned, the administration is generally required to defend it, but in the Maine and Indiana cases, the Justice Department chose to argue, as a friend-of-the-court, that the state laws were unconstitutional. The administration responds that while it supports state powers, some issues require federal solutions.    Many major battles over federal-state power are over the regulation of commerce, an area in which federal authority has expanded substantially. &quot;It is the centerpiece of constitutional politics for two centuries in a way that no other clause is,&quot; says Dennis Hutchinson, a University of Chicago professor.    As concerned as the framers were with the balance of power, there was surprisingly little dissent when the Constitutional Convention gave Congress authority &quot;to regulate commerce . . . among the several states&quot; and &quot;to make all laws . . . necessary and proper&quot; for its role, and made the Constitution and federal laws &quot;the supreme law of the land.&quot;    For many delegates, the concern at the convention was with curtailing the substantial, conflicting power the states exercised, particularly over commerce, under the Articles of Confederation. James Madison's notes, for example, show that James Wilson of Pennsylvania warned in a convention speech on June 21, 1787, &quot;. . . in spite of every precaution the general government would be in perpetual danger of encroachments from the state governments.&quot;    The delegates initially voted to give Congress broad power &quot;to legislate in all cases to which the separate states are incompetent, or in which the harmony of the United States may be interrupted&quot; and &quot;to negative all laws passed by the several states. . . .&quot; Later, the powers were defined in detail.    As the specific powers were detailed, a handful of delegates, led by Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, warned of the demise of state authority. But the strongest defense of state power came after the convention in the Federalist Papers that were written as political appeals for support for the Constitution.    A year after the Constitution's approval, there was still concern about the role of the states. Congress proposed the 10th Amendment that reserves for the states and the people all powers that aren't delegated to the federal government. But broad Supreme Court and legislative readings of Congress's power have made this a modest guarantee for the states.    A broad reading of congressional power to regulate commerce began with an 1824 Supreme Court decision that interstate commerce sometimes involves activity within a state. For the last 50 years, the Supreme Court has almost never found that Congress abused its power to regulate commerce.    Much of the current debate on the regulation of commerce is over what is called the &quot;dormant&quot; commerce power, a theory that the Constitution bars states from interfering with interstate commerce, even when it isn't being regulated by Congress.    The Supreme Court has expanded this theory in recent years. For example, the court in 1978 struck down a New Jersey law that barred use of landfills in the state for garbage from out-of-state. The court said the law discriminated against interstate commerce. Court fights over state taxation of multinational corporations have also been waged, in part, under this theory, and some states' laws have been upheld.    Even constitutional experts who disagree with the Reagan administration's analysis believe some adjustments are needed. Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe likens commerce to a &quot;stream that broadens and narrows.. . . When the stream becomes wide enough, anything can be linked to interstate commerce,&quot; and can be regulated by Congress, he says. &quot;But we've got to develop some islands in the stream to preserve&quot; the role of the states. </TEXT></DOC>
