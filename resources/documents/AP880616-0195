Police helicopters are already whirling over downtownskyscrapers at night and border immigration checks have beentightened, Metropolitan Police Staff Superintendent Bernard Nadeausaid Thursday.   ``The biggest threat is terrorism. Historically, they've alwaysbeen active at summit conferences. They have a way of getting intoa country illegally,'' Nadeau said in an interview.   Nadeau said police were investigating a news report from ManilaThursday that a Japanese Red Army suspect arrested in thePhilippines last week was planning to establish a base there forattacks on the Toronto Summit and the Summer Olympics in Seoul,South Korea.   Police are also focusing on the safety of British Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher, who narrowly escaped injury when the IrishRepublican Army bombed her hotel in Brighton, England, on Oct. 12,1984.   The IRA claimed responsibility for a booby-trap bomb in Lisburn,Northern Ireland, on Wednesday which killed six British soldierstaking part in a charity race.   ``We're uncomfortable any time British royalty visits, or anyoneconnected with the British government,'' said Nadeau. ``We'realways concerned that the IRA could be active.''   Protecting Mrs. Thatcher, President Reagan and the leaders offive other summit nations and the European Community has been mademore difficult by Canada's decision to hold the summit in thecountry's biggest city. Previous North American locations for theannual event have been Puerto Rico, Montebello, Quebec, andWilliamsburg, Va.   The last major city to host the summit was Tokyo in May 1986,when Japan's radical Middle Core Faction fired five homemaderockets into the downtown area. No one was injured.   The possibility of an attack on Japanese Prime Minister NoboruTakeshita arose in April when a suspected Japanese Red Armyterrorist, Yu Kikumura, 35, was arrested on the New JerseyTurnpike. Police found three pipe bombs and false papers in his car.   An 18-year-old Japanese college student, Yoshio Kosugi, wasdetained June 12 in Philadelphia after police found a rifle,grenades and ammunition in his luggage.   Police are equipped with computer-enhanced photographs of allknown Red Army members, and a helicopter-borne rapid deploymentassault squad staged a demonstration at an Ontario military basethis month to send a message to would-be terrorists. ``The publicwill never see them unless something happens,'' said Nadeau.   Canadian Solicitor General James Kelleher said the government isspending $4.9 million on summit security and deploying 3,000officers and agents.   Kelleher told Parliament Thursday: ``While we have no specificthreats at this time in any respect, there is a high level of riskand we must be very careful and make sure nothing untowardhappens.''   Nadeau said eight security forces are involved, not countingsecret service agents brought by the world leaders. They are theCanadian Secret Intelligence Service, Royal Canadian MountedPolice, Canadian armed forces, Ontario Provincial Police,Metropolitan Toronto Police, and the Durham, Peel and York regionalpolice forces.   Sharpshooters with high-powered rifles will be posted in officetowers, up to 15 city blocks will be sealed off as motorcades ferrythe leaders to and from their hotels, and city expressways will beclosed for 15 minutes at a time as delegates are escorted to dinnerengagements in the suburbs.   ``We've had people in and out of here for four or five months,''said Patrick Boutette of the Old Mill restaurant west of the city,where finance ministers dine Sunday night.   The first arrests occurred Wednesday when police broke up ananti-summit protest at the University of Toronto and charged 15people with trespassing.   Police denied permission for an anti-war group, Alliance forNon-Violent Action, to march down University Avenue to theMetropolitan Toronto Convention Center where the leaders will meet.``Demonstrators could occupy the attention of police and allowterrorists to act,'' Nadeau said.   He said police also worry about random attacks by ``unstablepersons'' like John Hinckley Jr., who shot and wounded Reagan in1981.   Despite its setting in a city of 3.4 million people, the summitwill take place in a security cocoon. ``At no time will thedelegates be on public view,'' said Toronto Police Chief Jack Marks.   Local resident Alex MacKenzie called it ironic that Reaganwalked the streets of Moscow, a place he once dubbed an ``evilempire,'' but Toronto is not considered safe enough for him toemerge from his armored limousine.</TEXT></DOC>
