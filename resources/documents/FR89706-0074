Thereferral process, established under authority of Section 309 of the CleanAir Act and CEQ's NEPA regulations, is a procedure for resolving federalinteragency disagreements concerning proposed major federal actions whichmight cause unsatisfactory environmental effects. EPA recommended thata programmatic EIS be prepared to address the programmatic goals and cumulativeimpacts of alternative beneficial uses of Central Valley Project water,or, at a minimum, that an EIS be developed regarding the Friant Unit contractrenewals. On February 9, 1989, CEQ published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>announcing an initial 25 day comment period.During this period, CEQ urged that DOI and EPA meet to try to resolve theirdifferences. A number of meetings between those two agencies took placeduring this period, but a mutually acceptable resolution was not achieved.On March 26, 1989, CEQ published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>stating that it intended to accept the referral.CEQ held a public meeting in Washington, DC, on April 13, 1989, and a publicmeeting in Fresno, California, on April 17, 1989 to take comment on theissue of ``whether the renewal of the long-term water contracts for theFriant Unit irrigation districts of the Central Valley project constitutea major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment, and, accordingly, that the contract renewal actions fallsunder section 102(2)(C) of NEPA?'' A written comment period to addressthe same issue ended on April 28, 1989. The Findings and Recommendations summarized below are explained in moredetail in the full CEQ document, which will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on Thursday, July 6, 1989. The Council appreciatesthe many thoughtful and comprehensive submissions of those who participatedin the process. Member Jacqueline Schafer has issued an individual statementof explanatory views. <ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Recommendations of the Council on Environmental Quality</ITAG>Findings 1. Under section 309 of the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental PolicyAct and the CEQ Regulations, the Environmental Protection Agency had theLegal Authority to Refer this Matter to the Council on Environmental Qualityand CEQ has the Authority to Accept and Consider the Matter and Issue Findingsand Recommendations. 2. The Secretary of the Department of the Interior has Limited DiscretionRegarding the Question of Whether to Renew the CVP/Friant Unit Long-TermWater Contracts. However, the Secretary has Sufficient Discretion Regardingthe Terms of the Contracts Such that Renewal of the Long-Term Water Contractsfor the Friant Unit Irrigation District of the Central Valley Project Constitutesa Major Federal Action Significantly Affecting the Quality of the HumanEnvironment and, accordingly, section 102(2)(c) of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act is Applicable to the Renewal of the Contracts. 3. The Bureau of Reclamation's Procedures for Implementing the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act Normally Require Preparation of an EnvironmentalImpact Statement (EIS) for Proposed Repayment Contracts and Water ServiceContracts or Amendments for Irrigation Where NEPA Compliance Has Not AlreadyBeen Accomplished. This Provision applies to the Renewal of Long-Term WaterContracts for the Friant Unit. 4. The Renewal of the Long-Term Water Contracts for the Friant Unit DoesNot Properly Fall Within the Department of the Interior's CategoricallyExclusions From NEPA Review. 5. The Secretary of the Interior Has Recognized that the Renewal of Long-TermWater Supply Contracts Poses Legitimate Environmental Concerns and hasDirected the Bureau of Reclamation to Conduct Assessment Studies Regardingthe Environmental Effects and to Explore Opportunities for EnvironmentalRecovery Programs. The Congressionally Mandated Framework for ConductingEnvironmental Analysis is the National Environmental Policy Act.Recommendations1. CEQ Recommends that the Bureau Prepare Environmental Impact Statementsfor Each of the Water Service Units of the Central Valley Project, Priorto the Renewal of the Individual Long-Term Water Contracts in that Unit,and that the Bureau Consider Whether a Programmatic EIS on all CentralValley Project Long-Term Contracts Would be a Useful, Efficient Approach.CEQ <T3>Strongly Recommends Against </T3>Preparation of Individual EISs onEach Separate Long-Term Water Contract. 2. The Bureau of Reclamation Should Define the ``No Action'' Alternativein the Environmental Impact Statements as the Renewal of the Long-TermContracts With No Significant Changes. 3. The Bureau of Reclamation Should Request the Appropriate Entities ofthe State of California to be a Joint Lead or Cooperating Agency with theBureau for Purposes of Preparing the Environmental Impact Statement(s).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 29, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">A.

EPA's letter stated that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Accordingly, I have determined that making irretrievable long-termcommitments of water use without benefit of an EIS [environmental impactstatement] violates the purposes and intent of NEPA. Further, in the absenceof environmental analysis that would indicate otherwise, I believe thatrenewal of these contracts is unsatisfactory from the standpoint of environmentalquality in the San Jaoquin River/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta/San FranciscoBay area.\4\</ITAG>On February 9, 1989, CEQ published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>\5\ stating that the referral had been receivedfrom EPA and announcing a twenty-five day comment period during which theDepartment of the Interior (DOI) and any other interested persons couldrespond to the referral from EPA. Specifically, the notice asked for commentsrelating to the issue of whether CEQ should proceed with the referral.In response to that notice, CEQ received approximately thirty letters.All letters received have been made available to the public upon requestto CEQ. During this initial comment period, CEQ urged the Department of the Interiorand the Environmental Protection Agency to meet and attempt to resolvetheir differences. While a number of meetings between those two agenciestook place during this period, a mutually acceptable resolution was notachieved. The Department of the Interior stated in its response to CEQ that it didnot believe that CEQ should accept the referral. Specifically, it raisedthe issues of EPA's authority to refer the matter under section 309 ofthe Clean Air Act, because DOI had determined that no EIS was requiredunder NEPA for the action in question. It also quesitoned CEQ's jurisdictionto accept the referral in light of the litigation over the issue raisedin the referral.\6\ After consideration of the comments received, CEQ published a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice on March 26, 1989,\7\ stating that itintended to accept the referral and announcing two meetings, open to thepublic under the Government in the Sunshine Act, and a written commentperiod, to take comment on the following issue:<ITAG tagnum="21">Whether the renewal of the long-term water contracts for the FriantUnit irrigation districts of the Central Valley Project constitutes a majorfederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environmentand, accordingly, that the contract renewal action falls under section102(2)(C) of NEPA?</ITAG>The notice emphasized that CEQ's examination in this referral would focusexclusively on the applicability of NEPA as it relates to the obligationsof the federal government in the renewal of these contracts, and wouldnot address the responsibilities of the State of California for water rightspermits. The first public meeting was held in Washington, DC, on April 13, 1989,followed by a public meeting in Fresno, California, on April 17, 1989.The written comment period ended on April 28, 1989. The Council receivedwell over 1,500 pages of written comments and testimony, as well as numerousbooklets, special studies and other related material. The Council appreciatesthe many thoughtful and comprehensive submissions of those who participatedin this process.   Background<ITAG tagnum="81">The Central Valley Project</ITAG>Responding to a momentous effort to ``open up the West'' for agriculturaldevelopment in the later half of the nineteenth century, Congress passedthe Reclamation Act of 1902 (hereinafter, referred to as the ReclamationAct). Among other things, the Reclamation Act authorized and directed theSecretary of the Interior to ``make examinations and surveys for, and tolocate and construct, as herein provided, irrigation works for the storage,diversion, and development of waters, including artesian wells,'' \8\ andestablished a special ``reclamation fund'' for that purpose.\9\ It authorizedthe Secretary to enter into contracts for the construction of irrigationprojects, and provided for a system of repayment by annual installmentcharges ``with a view of returning to the reclamation fund the estimatedcost of construction of the project.'' \1\\0\ The Reclamation Act providedfor a 160 acre restriction on the use of water for land in private ownership,and required that such landowners be an actual bona fide resident on theland or occupant thereof residing in the vicinity of the land.\1\\1\ Itprovided that the title to and the management and operation of the reservoirsand the works necessary for their protection and operation would remainwith the U.S. government. Once repayments required by the Reclamation Actfor the major portion of the lands irrigated from reclamation facilitieswere made, the management and operation of the irrigation works shouldpass to the owners of the lands irrigated thereby, ``to be maintained attheir expenses under such form of organization and under such rules andregulations as may be acceptable to the Secretary of the Interior.'' \1\\2\It authorized the Secretary of the Interior to acquire rights or propertyby purchase or by condemnation to carry out the Reclamation Act, with theassistance of the Attorney General.\1\\3\ Finally, in Section 8 of theReclamation Act, Congress declared that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Nothing in this act shall be construed as affecting or intended toaffect or to in any way interfere with the laws of any State or Territoryrelating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water usedin irrigation, or any vested right acquired thereunder, and the Secretaryof the Interior, in carrying out the provisions of this act, shall proceedin conformity with such laws, and nothing herein shall in any way affectany right of any State or of the Federal Government or of any landowner,appropriator, or user of water in, to, or from any interstate stream orthe waters thereof: Provided, That the right to the use of water acquiredunder the provisions of this act shall be appurtenant to the land irrigatedand beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure, and the limit of theright.\1\\4\</ITAG>The Central Valley Project was ``the largest single undertaking pursuantto the federal reclamation program'' in the history of the nation.\1\\5\The project was originally authorized by the California Legislature asthe California Central Valley Project Act and approved by California voters.However, the State was unable to sell the bonds necessary to finance theproject, and asked the Federal government to construct it.\1\\6\ Subsequently,the California plan was authorized by Congress in the Emergency ReliefAppropriation Act of 1935.\1\\7\ In 1937, the Central Valley Project wasauthorized as a Reclamation Act project. That authorization provided:<ITAG tagnum="21">That the entire Central Valley project, California heretofore authorizedand established under the provisions of the Emergency Relief AppropriationAct of 1935 (49 Stat. 1622) and the First Deficiency Appropriation Act,fiscal year 1936 (49 Stat. 1622), is hereby reauthorized and declared tobe for the purposes of improving navigation, regulating the flow of theSan Joaquin river and the Sacramento River, controlling floods, providingfor storage and for the delivery of the stored waters thereof, for thereclamation of arid and semiarid lands of Indian reservations, and otherbeneficial uses, and for the generation and sale of electric energy asa means of financially aiding and assisting such undertakings and in orderto permit the full utilization of the works constructed to accomplish theaforesaid purposes: Provided further, That, except as herein otherwisespecifically provided, the provisions of the reclamation law, as amended,shall govern the repayment of expenditures and the construction, operation,and maintenance of the dams, canals, power plants, pumping plants, transmissionlines, and incidental works deemed necessary to said entire project, andthe Secretary of the Interior may enter into repayment contracts, and othernecessary contracts, with State agencies, authorities, associations, persons,and corporations, either public or private, including all agencies withwhich contracts are authorized under the reclamation law, and may acquireby proceedings in eminent domain, or otherwise, all lands, rights-of-way,water rights, and other property necessary for said purposes: And providedfurther, That the said dam and reservoirs shall be used, first, for riverregulation, improvement of navigation, and flood control; second for irrigationand domestic uses; and third, for power.\1\\8\</ITAG>Congress passed the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 to provide for a ``feasibleand comprehensive plan for an economical and equitable treatment of repaymentproblems and for variable payments of construction charges which can bemet regularly and fully from year to year.'' \1\\9\ The Reclamation ProjectAct essentially authorized two types of CVP contracts: repayment contracts,the term of which was not to exceed forty years from the date when thefirst installment was due, often referred to as ``9(d) contracts'', andwater service contracts, often known as ``9(e) contracts''. The law specifiedthat the latter type of contracts, the ``9(e) contracts'', are in lieuof entering into a repayment contract to cover that part of the cost ofthe construction of works connected with water supply and allocated toirrigation. Specifically, the Secretary of the Interior, in his or herdiscretion, was authorized to:<ITAG tagnum="21">Enter into either short- or long-term contracts to furnish water forirrigation purposes. Each such contract shall be for such period, not toexceed forty years, and at such rates as in the Secretary's judgment willproduce revenues at least sufficient to cover an appropriate share of theannual operation and maintenance cost and an appropriate share of suchfixed charges as the Secretary deems proper, due consideration being givento that part of the cost of construction of works connected with watersupply and allocated to irrigation; and shall require payment of said rateseach year in advance of delivery of water for said year.\2\\0\</ITAG>In 1940, Congress amended the Central Valley Project (CVP) authorizationto add to the authorized purposes of the ``construction under the provisionsof the Federal reclamation laws of such distribution systems as the Secretaryof the Interior deems necessary in connection with lands for which saidstored waters are to be delivered.'' \2\\1\Following passage of the 1939 amendments which provided for water servicecontracts as well as repayment contracts for recipients of CVP water, thewater users became concerned about their right to future water suppliesafter the expiration of their contracts with the Bureau of Reclamation.As a result, in 1956, Congress passed amendments to the Reclamation ProjectAct of 1939 which applied to both repayment and water service contracts.Specifically, the amendments direct the Secretary of the Interior to:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) include in any long-term contract hereafter entered into undersaid subsection (e) provision [the ``9(e) water service contracts], ifthe other contracting party so requests, for renewal thereof under statedterms and conditions mutually agreeable to the parties. Such terms andconditions shall provide for an increase or decrease in the charges setforth in the contract to reflect, among other things, increases or decreasesin construction, operation, and maintenance costs and improvement or deteriorationin the party's repayment capacity. Any right of renewal shall be exercisedwithin such reasonable time prior to the expiration of the contract asthe parties shall have agreed upon and set forth therein;.\2\\2\</ITAG>The amendments also provided for the conversion of any long-term contractsentered into after the date of these amendments under subsection (e) (waterservice contracts) into contracts under subsection (d) (repayment contracts)upon the request of a contracting organization and upon stated terms andconditions mutually agreeable to the parties.\2\\3\ Further, the Secretarywas directed to provide to the other party of either repayment contractsor water service contracts:<ITAG tagnum="21">During the term of the contract and of any renewal thereof and subjectto fulfillment of all obligations thereunder, [the other party has] a firstright (to which right the rights of the holders of any other type of irrigationwater contract shall be subordinate) to a stated share or quantity of theproject's available water supply for beneficial use on the irrigable landswithin the boundaries of, or owned by, the party and a permanent rightto such share or quantity upon completion of payment of the amount assignedfor ultimate return by the party subject to payment of an appropriate shareof such costs, if any, as may thereafter be incurred by the United Statesin its operation and maintenance of the project works;* * * * \2\\4\</ITAG>The Secretary of the Interior was also authorized to negotiate amendmentsto water service contracts at the time of the 1956 amendment,\2\\5\ andthe term ``long-term contract'' was defined to mean ``any contract theterm of which is more than ten years.'' \2\\6\In 1982, Congress passed the Reclamation Reform Act,\2\\7\ applicable toboth repayment and water service contracts between the United States andirrigation districts.\2\\8\ Among other provisions, that Act revised thepricing provisions for CVP users,\2\\9\ increased the acreage limitationfrom 160 acres to 960 acres,\3\\0\ and eliminated the residency requirement.\3\\1\It also instructed the Secretary of the Interior to encourage the fullconsideration and incorporation of prudent and responsible and economicallyfeasible water conservation measures in the operations of non-Federal recipientsof irrigation water from Federal reclamation projects, and required eachdistrict which had entered into a repayment contract or water service contractto develop a water conservation plan containing definite goals, appropriatewater conservation measures, and a time schedule.\3\\2\ Further, the amendmentsrequire that the Secretary shall publish notice of a proposed repaymentcontract or water service contract or amendment thereto and provide foran opportunity for submission of written data, views and arguments no lessthan sixty days before entering into or amending any such contract, andthat the Secretary should consider all substantive comments received duringthat period.\3\\3\In 1986, Congress passed a series of amendments dealing with water resourceand reclamation projects.\3\\4\ Among these amendments is a provision directingthat the Secretary of the Interior shall include in all new or amendedcontracts for the delivery of water from the CVP a provision providingfor the automatic adjustments of rates if it is found that the rate ineffect may not be adequate to recover ``the appropriate share of the existingFederal investment in the project by the year 2030.'' The contracts mustalso include a provision authorizing the Secretary to adjust determinationsof ability to pay every five years.The Central Valley Project has developed throughout this century as a complexseries of dams, canals, power facilities, fish hatcheries, irrigation distributionsystems, pumping plants, reservoirs and related facilities, running virtuallythe full length of the California Central Valley. Major components of theCVP are the Trinity Dam and Reservoir and the Shasta Dam on the SacramentoRiver, the Folsom Dam and Reservoir on the American River, the Tracy PumpingPlant, which lifts CVP water into the Delta-Mendota Canal for deliveryalong the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, the San Luis Dam and Reservoiron the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and the Friant Dam on the SanJoaquin River. According to the Bureau of Reclamation, the entire CVP projectprovides 9.1 million acre feet of water for 2.7 million acres of irrigatedland under approximately 300 long-term water service contracts. Approximatelyninety percent of this water is used for agriculture purposes. Supplementalmunicipal and industrial water is supplied to more than two million peopleon an annual basis.\3\\5\The Friant UnitThe Friant Dam and the related Madera and Friant/Kern Canals were one ofthe first major features of the CVP to be authorized and constructed. TheFriant Dam is located on the San Joaquin River, and provides flood control,conservation storage and diversion into the two canals. Millerton Lake,created by Friant Dam, has a total capacity of 520,500 acre-feet.\36\ TheFriant-Kern Canal, with a capacity of 5,000 cubic feet per second, carrieswater south from Millerton Lake for 151.8 miles and terminates in the KernRiver near Bakersfield. The Madera Canal, with a capacity of 1,000 cubicfeet per second, carries water north from Millerton Lake for 35.9 milesand terminates at the Chowchilla River. Major construction for the FriantUnit was completed in 1951.\3\\7\Two types of contracts were entered into in 1939 to provide the UnitedStates with the rights to divert and store water from the San Joaquin River.The first, ``purchase contracts,'' involved the purchase by the Bureauof Reclamation of a holder's rights to the flood or ``overflow rights''of the San Joaquin River. The second type of contracts, ``exchange contracts,''allowed the Bureau of Reclamation to divert a hodler's water rights atthe Friant Dam in exchange for an alternative supply of water from theShasta Dam. These arrangements allowed for the operation of the FriantDivision of the CVP.\3\\8\ The Bureau of Reclamation has emphasized inits presentations and statements in this referral that the Friant Unitis an independent hydrological unit that does not receive a direct supplyof water from the rest of the CVP.\3\\9\The CVP water from the Friant Unit is used to irrigate approximately onemillion acres of land which produced crops valued at $1.8 billion dollarsin 1987.\4\\0\ In the Friant Unit, there are twenty-eight long-term waterservice contracts. The first contract to expire was for the Orange CoveIrrigation District (expired on February 28, 1989); the majority of thecontracts expire between now and 1997, with one contract expiring as lateas the year 2026.\4\\1\<ITAG tagnum="84">The National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was passed by Congress in1969, and signed into law by President Nixon on January 1, 1970.\4\\2\It established a national policy for the environment. Title I of the Actdeclares that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Congress, recognizing the profound impact of man's activity onthe interrelations of all components of the natural environment, particularlythe profound influences of population growth, high-density urbanization,industrial expansion, resource exploitation, and new and expanding technologicaladvances and recognizing further the critical importance of restoring andmaintaining environmental quality to the overall welfare and developmentof man, declares that it is the continuing policy of the Federal Government,in cooperation with State and local governments, and other concerned pubicand private organizations, to use all practicable means and measures, includingfinancial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to foster andpromote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under whichman and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social,economic and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans.\4\\3\</ITAG>To aid in implementation of that policy, the Congress directed that allfederal agencies include in proposals for major federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environemnt, a detailed statement bythe responsible official on:(i) The environmental impact of the proposed action,(ii) Any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should theproposal be implemented,(iii) Alternatives to the proposed action,(iv) The relationship between local short-term uses of man's environmentand the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and(v) Any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which wouldbe involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.\4\\4\Over the past nineteen years, this statutory mandate has developed intowhat is known as the ``NEPA process.'' Most commonly associated with thepreparation of environmental impact statements (EISs), NEPA law has evolvedlargely through federal court decisions and interpretation by the Councilon Environmental Quality through the CEQ regulations, guidance documentsand referral findings and recommendations.\4\\5\The requirements of NEPA and the CEQ regulations implementing the proceduralprovisions of NEPA \4\\6\ apply to all agencies of the federal government,\4\\7\and to all federal actions, excluding judicial or administrative civilor criminal enforcement actions and the distribution of general revenuesharing funds.\4\\8\ Actions do include:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * new and continuing activities, including projects and programsentirely or partly financed, assisted, conducted, regulated, or approvedby federal agencies; new or revised agency rules, regulations, plans, policies,or procedures; and legislative proposals * * * \49\</ITAG>The CEQ NEPA regulations require each federal agency to develop its ownset of NEPA procedures.\50\ These agency procedures identify which typesof actions normally meet the criteria for preparation of an EIS, whichactions normally require environmental assessments, and which actions normallydo not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environmentand therefore can be categorically excluded from further NEPA review procedures,(unless there are extraordinary circumstances warranting environmentalanalysis).Each agency must consult with CEQ while developing its procedures and beforepublishing them in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for comment. The procedures are to be adoptedonly after an opportunity for public review and after review by CEQ forconformity with NEPA and the CEQ implementing regulations.\51\An environmental assessment (EA) may be prepared to help an agency determinewhether the proposed action is of such a magnitude as to require the preparationof an EIS.\52\ An EA reaches one of two conclusions: either (1) A decisionto prepare an EIS, or (2) a Finding of No Significant Impact, which meansthat an EIS will not be prepared. If a proposed federal action is a ``major federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment,''\53\ the agency must preparean EIS. It begins by publication of a ``Notice of Intent'' to that effectin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and, frequently, other media in the affectedarea.\54\ A ``scoping process'' then is commenced to identify the issueswhich will be addressed in the EIS, to identify other environmental lawswhich must be complied with to complete the action, to allocate assignmentsfor preparation of the EIS among the lead and cooperating agencies, andto indicate the relationship between the timing of the preparation of theEIS and the agency's tentative planning and decisionmaking schedule.\55\At this point, the lead agency may also set time limits on the processand page limits on the EIS. This process involves other agencies at alllevels of government and the general public. Public meetings are not requiredbut often are held by the agency in affected localities.A draft EIS is then prepared by either the federal agency or a party undercontract to the agency. The EIS must include a discussion of the purposeof and need for the proposed action, alternatives to the proposed action,including a no-action alternative, analysis of the affected environmentand of the environmental consequences of the proposed action and alternatives,a list of persons who prepared the document, a list of agencies, organizationsand persons to whom the statement is being mailed, and an index. Technicalappendices may also be included.\56\The draft EIS is circulated for public and agency comment for at leastforty-five days.\57\ Federal agencies with jurisdiction by law or specialexpertise with respect to any of the relevant environmental impacts areexpected to comment.\58\ The lead agency must then evaluate the commentletters and prepare a final EIS.\59\ Substantive comments received on thedraft EIS generally are attached to the final statement, along with theagency's response.\60\No decision may be made concerning the proposed action until at least thirtydays after the notice of availability of the final EIS.\61\ At the timeof its decision, the agency must prepare a Record of Decision which explainsthe decision, identifies alternatives considered by the agency in reachingits decision, specifies which alternatives were considered to be environmentallypreferable, and discusses factors which were balanced by the agency inmaking its decision. Further, the Record of Decision states whether allpractical methods to avoid or minimize environmental harm are being adopted,and, if not, why not. A description of any applicable monitoring and enforcementprogram adopted for applicable mitigation is also included.\62\ The CEQ regulations require federal agencies to cooperate with State andlocal agencies to the fullest extent possible to reduce duplication betweenNEPA and State and local requirements. A State or local agency may actas a joint lead agency to prepare an EIS.\63\ Further, federal agenciesare directed to engage in joint planning processes, joint environmentalresearch and studies, joint public hearings and joint environmental assessmentswith State and local agencies to the extent possible.\64\ To better integrateNEPA into State or local planning processes, EISs must discuss any inconsistencyof a proposed action with an approved State or local law or plan.\65\ <ITAG tagnum="85">The National Environmental Policy Act and Renewal of the Friant IrrigationDistrict Contracts</ITAG>The Bureau of Reclamation and the Department ofthe Interior: Actions Leading up to Determination that NEPA Does Not RequirePreparation of EIS for Renewal of Long-Term Water ContractsAware that the Friant Irrigation District long-term water contracts underthe Central Valley Project would begin to expire in 1989, the Bureau ofReclamation (hereinafter, Bureau) began internal discussions early in 1987regarding the applicable level of environmental documentation and analysisnecessary for renewal of the contracts. On August 13, 1987, the Mid-PacificRegion of the Bureau sent the Basis of Negotiation on the Friant Unit contractrenewals to the Commissioner of Reclamation. According to the Bureau ofReclamation's submittal to CEQ in the context of this referral, the Bureau'sRegional office believed at that time that the contract renewals fell undera categorical exclusion which obviated the need to prepare either an EAor an EIS.\66\Early in 1988, the Friant Water Users Authority provided the AssistantSecretary of the Interior for Water and Science a copy of a legal opinionfrom their counsel, arguing that the Bureau is obligated to renew the FriantUnit contracts with only those mutually agreed to contract changes necessaryto comply with current Reclamation law. In March of 1988, the Regionaloffice of the Bureau submitted a supplemental Basis for Negotiation onthe Friant Unit contract renewals to the Commissioner for approval, incorporatinga needs analysis which stated that the Friant Unit contractors had beneficiallyused their contractural water supplies and had a continuing need for thesame water supplies. The Regional Office also stated to the Commissionerat that time their belief that the 1956 amendments to the Reclamation Actof 1902 entitled each contractor to renew its water service contract forthe quantities of project water specified in its existing contract unlessit was determined that the contractor was not beneficially using such quantities.\67\In a response to that submittal, the Commissioner of the Bureau statedthat, ``No contract will be given final approval until the Bureau has completedthe appropriate level of environmental documentation.'' He also statedthat, ``It should be noted that we do not necessarily agree with your conclusionthat contractors are entitled to renew their water service contracts forthe same quantities of water.''\68\Also in March of 1988, Congressmen Tony Coehlo, Charles Pashayan, Jr.,Bill Thomas and Richard Lehman wrote to the Secretary of the Interior expressingconcern that the water irrigation district's attempts to renew their long-termwater contracts were:<ITAG tagnum="21">Being impeded by very questionable interpretations and positions onNEPA's requirements, and on responsibility for determining quantities ofwater, being taken by the Bureau.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the way of background, we understand that a preliminary decisionhas been made by the Bureau to discontinue the contract renewal processuntil individual environmental assessments are first completed on eachapplicable contract. However, the Department's NEPA procedures categoricallyexcludes renewal of water service contracts from the environmental assessmentprocess. In our view, the Department's procedures are appropriate. We seeno legal ground for the Bureau to waive this provision.\69\</ITAG>At some point in early 1988, a ``Notice of Intent to Prepare EnvironmentalAssessment for the Allocation of Water Presently Used in the Friant UnitService Area'' was prepared, although apparently never published.\70\ InApril, 1988, the Regional Office of the Bureau began preparation of anenvironmental assessment on the contract renewals. According to the Bureau'ssubmittal to CEQ, ``the contractor's right to the existing water quantitieswas not being questioned. It was simply felt that an environmental assessmentmight be an appropriate route to completing the administrative record.''\71\A fifty page ``Preliminary Draft Environmental Assessment for Friant-KernWater Allocation'' was then prepared by the Mid-Pacific Regional Officeof the Bureau and completed in June of 1988.\72\ It contained a backgroundand purpose and need analysis, alternatives, including a proposed actionof renegotiating the Friant-Kern Contracts without changes to the functions,operations or maintenance of the existing facilities,\73\ a ``no action''alternative defined as allowing the existing contracts to expire withoutrenewal, an alternative considering reallocation of available MillertonLake water, and an alternative for modifying operations of the MillertonLake for allocation to fish, wildlife and for recreational benefits. Further,it included a discussion of the affected environment and environmentalconsequences of the proposed action and alternatives, including water resourcesand quality, wetlands, floodplains and ground water, fish, wildlife andvegetation, geology and soils, air quality and climate, land use, recreationand social and economic impacts and cultural resources. It also includeda list of preparers and consultants and references, as well as certainexhibits. During this period, the Regional office also had ongoing discussionswith the Fish and Wildlife Service to obtain a list of threatened and endangeredspecies which might be located in the Friant Unit.\74\Also in April, 1988, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Waterand Science stated in a response to the Congressmen's March 21, 1988 letter,that because of the uncertainty over the potential conflict in legal obligationsregarding the applicability of NEPA requirements to the renewal of theFriant Unit contracts, the issue would be reviewed by the Solicitor's Officeof the Department of the Interior.\75\The Solicitor of the Department of the Interior issued his opinion on November10, 1988.\76\ After an analysis of the pertinent Reclamation law, NEPA,the Department of the Interior's NEPA procedures, and the Friant Unit watercontracts, the opinion concluded that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Bureau of Reclamationis not required to prepare an environmental impact statement or assessmentconcerning mere renewals of Friant Unit contracts that contain substantiallythe same terms and conditions as are contained in existing contracts, becausesuch renewals constitute non-discretionary actions and do nothing morethan retain the <T3>status quo</T3>. Even if the renewals were subject to NEPA, they wouldbe subject to a categorical exclusion from the preparation of such environmentalreview documents. Changes in terms and conditions, with the exception ofadministrative and financial changes such as rates, however, may requiresome environmental assessment. The applicability of the categorical exclusionfor contract renewals involving such changes in the contracts must be measuredcarefully on a case-by-case basis, utilizing the checklist included inthe Bureau's Handbook.\77\</ITAG>The Environmental Protection Agency: Actions Leading up to Referral ofthe Matter to the Council on Environmental Quality.The Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reviewedthe Bureau's announcements of negotiations for water contracts within theFriant Unit of the CVP in the fall of 1988. On October 19, 1988, the Directorof the Office of External Affairs for the EPA's Regional office wrote tothe Regional Director of the Bureau and recommended that the Bureau preparea programmatic EIS for the proposed renewals for all CVP units which are``similar actions'' under NEPA, and more detailed supplemental EISs forcontract renewals for Friant and each of the other Units.\78\ The letteralso recommended that forty year contracts not be renewed until the SanFrancisco Bay/Sacramento River Delta standards were finalized in 1990 bythe California State Water Resources Control Board since ``new standardscould render these contracts unachievable. Interim contracts could be signeduntil environmental reviews are completed.''\79\In January, 1989, the Regional Office of EPA again wrote to the RegionalOffice of the Bureau ``to reiterate serious concerns * * * about the Bureau'sproposal to renew Friant Unit contracts without conducting formal environmentalevaluation(s) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).''\80\On February 2, 1989, the EPA Regional Administrator for Region 9 met withDepartment of the Interior officials to discuss this matter.\81\On February 2, 1989, EPA referred ``the proposal by the Department of Interior'sBureau of Reclamation to renew long-term water contracts for the OrangeCove and other Friant Unit irrigation districts of the Central Valley Project(CVP).''\82\ In its Predecision Referral Statement, EPA stated that:<ITAG tagnum="21">EPA believes that long-term renewal of Orange Cove and other FriantUnit irrigation district contracts without an EIS strikes at the purposeand utility of NEPA as a sound environmental assessment and managementtool for Federal decision making. EPA also finds that BuRec's action isunsatisfactory because it fails to consider water quality impacts of long-termrenewal without measures to adjust terms and conditions to control waterquantity and quality to maintain and restore in-stream beneficial uses.The current plans for entering into these long-term renewals also fails[sic] to consider the results of the California SWRCB project investigatingDelta/San Francisco Bay water quality.\83\</ITAG>EPA recommended that the Department of the Interior and the Bureau initiate:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * development of a programmatic EIS addressing programmatic goalsand cumulative impacts of alternative beneficial uses of CVP waters. Atminimum, we recommend that an EIS be developed to describe the Friant Unitcontract renewals. EPA recommends that Interior consider a short-term extensionof the existing contracts, or interim contracts of perhaps two years, whilethese matters are under consideration and/or an EIS is being prepared.We believe that interim contracts would prevent an interruption of currentwater use without compromising national environmental policy. We suggestthat the same approach would be applicable to other CVP contract negotiationsupcoming before an EIS is prepared, and prior to findings or decisionsof the SWRCB.\84\</ITAG>Actions Taken by the Department of the Interior/Bureau of Reclamation andthe Environmental Protection Agency Since the Date of the ReferralAs noted earlier,\85\ during the period between EPA's referral of thismatter to CEQ and CEQ's decision to accept the referral (from February2, 1989 to March 3, 1989), there were a number of meetings held betweenofficials of EPA and the DOI. However, the meetings did not resolve thedifferences between the two agencies regarding the applicability of NEPAto the renewal of the Friant Unit contracts.On April 11, 1989, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior announcedthat he was offering a forty year renewal of the irrigation contract forthe Orange Cove irrigation district of the Friant Unit. Secreary Lujanstated that his decision was guided by three basic principles:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. The federal government has both a legal and a moral obligationto the water users of the Friant Unit. Failure to meet that obligationwould be devastating to the economy of the entire area and would representa severe breach of faith.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The State of California has the primary authority to determinebasic water rights and entitlements on the basis of beneficial use, waterquality, and other regional considerations. This principle of state primacyis one which must be respected at the federal level and is entirely consistentwith this contract renewal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Within the framework of these long-standing obligations, it mustbe recognized that the renewal of long-term water supply contracts pose[ ] [sic] legitimate environmental concerns, and I will, along with thestate, evaluate these issues.\86\</ITAG>Secretary Lujan amplified the third point, dealing with environmental studies,by stating:<ITAG tagnum="21">To address these environmental issues, I am directing the Commissionerof the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct assessment studies to determineif any environmental effects result from deliveries of water under therenewed contract and to share this research with the state and district.Additionally, I am asking the Commissioner to explore opportunities forenvironmental recovery programs in the San Joaquin River Basin. It is myintent that these studies be carried out in conjunction with the stateand other interested organizations, and that the findings will be consideredby the state and the districts as they adopt environmentally sensitiveoperating procedures and water policies.\87\</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Recommendations of the Council on Environmental Quality</ITAG>Findings 1. Under section 309 of the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental PolicyAct and the CEQ Regulations, the Environmental Protection Agency Had theLegal Authority to Refer this Matter to the Council on Environmental Qualityand CEQ Has the Authority to Accept and Consider the Matter and Issue Findingsand Recommendations. During the course of this referral, the Department of the Interior, theBureau of Reclamation and several other interested parties have arguedthat because the DOI had made a decision that no EIS was required, EPAhad no authority to refer this matter to CEQ, and that CEQ had no authorityto accept the referral. These arguments reflect a narrow reading of theagencies' respective authority under NEPA and the Clean Air Act, as wellas a misunderstanding of CEQ's historical role in the referral process.Section 309 of the Clean Air Act provides that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The Administrator shall review and comment in writing on the environmentalimpact of any matter relating to duties and responsibilities granted pursuantto this chapter or other provisions of the authority of the Administrator,contained in any (1) legislation proposed by any Federal department oragency, (2) newly authorized Federal projects for construction and anymajor Federal agency action (other than a project for construction) towhich section 4332(2)(C) of this title applies, and (3) proposed regulationspublished by any department or agency of the Federal Government. Such writtencomment shall be made public at the conclusion of any such review. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) In the event the Administrator determines that any such legislation,action, or regulation is unsatisfactory from the standpoint of public healthor welfare or environmental quality, he shall publish his determinationand the matter shall be referred to the Council on Environmental Quality.\88\</ITAG>The legislative history of this section reveals a direction to EPA to interprethis responsibilities broadly, and to focus on the environmental impactsof a proposed action, as opposed to just an evaluation of the sufficiencyof the statement. For example, the Conference agreement ``instructs theAdministrator to review and comment on Federal actions which affect theenvironment.'' \89\ There is also evidence that Congress intended the Administratorof EPA to make an independent judgment about whether a proposed federalaction has significant environmental impacts. For example, these statementsrelated to section 309 (then referred to as section 310) were made at theconfirmation hearing of the first Administrator of EPA:<ITAG tagnum="21">With respect to section 310 which I have just read, this makes youa self-starter, whenever you, unilaterally, see an environmental risk.You are given the responsibility to raise the red flag. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">What is involved here is not an input to somebody else's decision* * * This is an issue to be taken by you. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Moreover, I think even if an activity started 50 years ago, if thereis reason to look at it in the light of current environmental concerns,it is your responsibility to be a self-starter in that connection and undertaketo use whatever authority you have to restrain or even to prevent suchan ongoing activity if, in your dugement, the judgments of your people,there is an unfortunate environmental impact.\90\</ITAG>In 1977, CEQ was directed by Executive Order to include in its NEPA regulationsprocedures:<ITAG tagnum="21">(2) For the referral to the Council of conflicts between agenciesconcerning the implementation of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, as amended, and Section 309 of the Clean Air Act, as amended,for the Council's recommendation as to their prompt resolution.\91\</ITAG>The CEQ regulations implementing the referral process that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Under section 309 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7609), the Administratorof the Environmental Protection Agency is directed to review and commentpublicly on the environmental impacts of Federal activities, includingactions for which environmental impact statements are prepared. If afterthis review the Administrator determines that the matter is `unsatisfactoryfrom the standpoint of public health or welfare or environmental quality,'section 309 directs that the matter be referred to the Council (hereinafter`environmental referrals').\92\</ITAG>Since 1973, CEQ has had twenty-four matters referred under NEPA and Section309 of the Clean Air Act. In at least thirteen of those referral matters,CEQ's Findings and Recommendations related to the environmental impactsof the proposed action, and not to the sufficiency of the analysis of thoseimpacts.\93\ In at least one referral from EPA, the proposed action hadnot been the subject of an EIS.\94\ Finally, it has been suggested that CEQ should not proceed with the referralproceedings because the same issue raised in the referral is at issue inthe litigation filed in federal district court.\95\ CEQ is sensitive tothis situation and has closely coordinated its activities with the Departmentof Justice to avoid potential conflict between the referral process andthe ongoing litigation. The federal courts have recognized CEQ's centralrole in interpreting the requirements of NEPA. The Supreme Court of theUnited States has stated, and recently reaffirmed, that ``CEQ's interpretationof NEPA is entitled to substantial deference.'' \96\ Resolution of this referral proceeding prior to the court proceedings onthe merits, currently scheduled for June of 1990, could potentially obviatethe need for litigation or, alternatively, provide the court with CEQ'sFindings and Recommendations in this matter. As Secretary Lujan statedin a letter to CEQ, ``This will allow the court to examine the Council'sfinal response to the referral before issuing any judgment that may affectrenewed water contracts.'' \97\ 2. The Secretary of the Department of the Interior Has Limited DiscretionRegarding the Question of <T3>Whether </T3>to Renew the CVP/Friant Unit Long-Term Water Contracts.However, the Secretary Has Sufficient Discretion Regarding the Terms ofthe Contacts Such That Renewal of the Long-Term Water Contracts For theFriant Unit Irrigation Districts of the Central Valley Project Constitutesa Major Federal Action Significantly Affecting the Quality of the HumanEnvironment and, Accordingly, the Contract Renewal Action Falls Under section102(2)(C) of NEPA. The 1956 amendments to the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 \98\ were clearlydrafted and enacted to give the holders of CVP long-term water contractsa level of reassurance that they would be entitled to special legal andadministrative consideration when their current contracts expired. Somedistinctions have been made between the right to renewal clauses for pre-1956contracts, as opposed to contracts entered into after the 1956 amendments.\99\However, as discussed in the Solicitor's opinion of November 10, 1988,there is a strong argument in favor of treating the pre-1956 and post-1956contracts in a similar manner.\100\ The remainder of this discussion willassume that those contracts which have been amended under authority ofthe 1956 amendments contain a right to a renewal of a contract for water.That assumption also includes the cautionary note in the Solicitor's opinionthat ``any renewal right created by the 1956 Act, or other authority, isconditioned upon the satisfactory adherence to the terms of water contractsand state and federal law.'' \101\ NEPA is, of course, a federal law, andthere is nothing in either reclamation law, or in NEPA, or in general rulesof legislative construction to indicate that NEPA or any other laws passedsince 1956 are not applicable to the renewal of the water contracts atissue. In fact, the approved contract between the Bureau and the OrangeCove Irrigation District includes contractual provisions binding the contractorto comply with applicable water and air pollution laws and equal opportunitylaws which were passed primarily after the execution of the original contractsand after the 1956 amendments.\102\ The inquiry about discretion, however, does not stop here. Assuming, <T3>arguendo, </T3>a right to renewal in compliance with applicable federaland state laws, the inquiry must focus on what the right to renewal meansin the context of renewing particular contracts. Nothing in the 1956 amendmentsor in any other law requires the Secretary of the Interior to authorizerenewal of the long-term water contracts on precisely the same terms andconditions as the original contracts. Rather, the 1956 amendments providethat if the other contracting party so requests, the long-term contractshall be renewed under:<ITAG tagnum="21">stated terms and conditions mutually agreeable to the parties. Suchterms and conditions shall provide for an increase or decrease in the chargesset forth in the contract to reflect, among other things, increases ordecreases in construction, operation, and maintenance costs and improvementor deterioration in the party's repayment capacity.\103\</ITAG>Further, there is nothing in the 1956 amendments which guarantees the rightto renew for the same quantity of water; rather, the pertinent amendmentsays that parties to these long-term contracts:<ITAG tagnum="21">have a first right * * * to a stated share or quantity of the project'savailable water supply for beneficial use on the irrigable lands * * ** \104\</ITAG>The Solicitor's opinion interprets this provision to mean that ``thereis no discretion with respect to the quantity of water to be supplied undera renewed contract.'' \105\ EPA's legal opinion, on the other hand, arguesthat the amendment:<ITAG tagnum="21">can reasonably be interpreted as simply directing the Secretary, asa matter of federal law, to include in renewed contacts a stated shareof the amount of water determined to be available for beneficial irrigationuses, giving preference to existing contractors over other irrigation users.[cite omitted] In making this beneficial use determination, and subjectto the State of California's water permitting authority, the Secetary mayconsider competing beneficial uses, such as augmentation of in-stream flowsto meet state water quality standards, and assess whether it is reasonablein today's water environment to devote the full contract amount exclusivelyto irrigation.\106\</ITAG>The issue of defining the ``stated share or quantity of the project's availablewater supply for beneficial use'' is inextricably bound up in the complicatedrelationship between federal and state water law. As discussed above, reclamationlaw specifically provide that beneficial use \107\ is the ``basis, themeasure and the limit of the right'' to the use of water acquired underreclamation law and that nothing in reclamation law should be construedas affecting or in any way interfering with state laws regarding control,appropriation, use or distribution of water.\108\ Secretary Lujan has specificallyrecognized the role of state law in determining ``basic water rights andentitlements on the basis of beneficial use, water quality, and other regionalconsiderations,'' which must be respected so long as it is not inconsistentwith Federal law.\109\The U.S. Supreme Court has had several occasions to consider the relationshipbetween federal and state law with regard to water allocation rights inthe context of the Central Valley Project.\110\ Throughout its considerationof this issue, it has recognized that, depending upon the exact circumstances,either federal or state law or both may apply to a given question. TheCourt has stated that, ``We think it clear that throughout the conception,enactment and subsequent administration of the plan, Congress has recognizedthe property status of water rights vested under California law,'' \111\but it has cautioned that ``the acquisition of water rights must not beconfused with the operation of federal projects.'' \112\ Rather, the UnitedStates is required to comply with California state law ``when, in the constructionand operation of a reclamation project, it becomes necessary for it toacquire water rights or vested interests therein.'' \113\ While thus acknowledgingthe importance of California's interpretation of ``beneficial use'' inthe context of the Reclamation Project Act and amendments thereto, theU.S. Supreme Court stated that:<ITAG tagnum="21">As we see it, the authority to impose the conditions of the contractshere comes from the power of the Congress to condition the use of federalfunds, works, and projects on compliance with reasonable requirements.''\114\</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Finally, in its most recent examination of this issue, the SupremeCourt, in an exhaustive examination of the law concerning the federal andstate water rights related to the CVP, held that the Department of theInterior should follow state law regarding the ``control, appropriation,use or distribution of water'' except to the extent that state law wouldimpose conditions inconsistent with clear Congressional directive.\115\It is therefore clear that, while the State of California has primacy concerningthe allocation of water rights, the federal government, through the Departmentof the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation, retains a significant role. Duringthe public meeting held in Washington, DC on this referral, the AssociateSolicitor for the Department of the Interior agreed that ``* * * at somepoint between one and fifty percent'', a reduction in the water rightsallocated to CVP users by the State of California would frustrate the Congressionalpurpose.\116\ Recently, the Bureau argued that the State Water ResourcesControl Board did not have jurisdiction to impose a warm water dischargerestriction on another CVP unit.\117\ It is not clear whether the Bureauwill comply with the water quality standards being prepared in the currentBay/Delta hearings of the State Water Resource Control Board.\118\ Indeed,in his memorandum to the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation approvingthe proposed renewal contract with Orange Cove Irrigation District, SecretaryLujan directed the Commissioner to add an additional contractual provisionwhich reads:<ITAG tagnum="21">In the event that the State Water Resources Control Board, in accordancewith state and federal law, modifies the permit granted to the United Statesfor appropriation of water, the parties agree to negotiate amendments asnecessary to incorporate these modifications. The United States and Contractorshall defend project rights to divert and use water delivered under thisagreement before all courts and agencies exercising jurisdiction over saidrights. Nothing herein shall permit changes to contract water quantities,except on an equitable sharing basis among all contractors utilizing thewater diverted under said permit.\119\</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Secretary Lujan explained in his memo that this new provision ``willclarify the role of the State in originally providing water rights underpermit to the United States and * * * makes explicit the obligation ofthe United States to defend its project water rights.'' \120\To summarize briefly, the Reclamation amendments do not give the originalcontractors a right to the same amount of water as was granted in the originalcontract. The State of California, through its water permitting authority,the State Water Resources Control Board, will allocate water to the CVPusers based upon the State's definition of beneficial use. The federalgovernment has an obligation to comply with the water permit conditionsimposed by the State Water Resources Control Board, unless those conditionsfrustrate federal law.Turning to another point, the term of the contracts is not fixed by lawat forty years; rather, the 1956 amendments define the term ``long termcontract'' as any contract the term of which is more than ten years \121\and the Reclamation Project Act authorizes contracts ``not to exceed fortyyears.''\122\In sum, CEQ finds that the Secretary of the Interior has limited discretionregarding whether to renew the long-term water contracts for the CVP, andthat the Congressional purpose behind the 1956 amendments was to give theoriginal water contractors assurance of considerable priority and preferencein regards to renewal of those contracts. However, the Secretary of theInterior may exercise considerable discretion to change significant termsof the contract (such as rates, length of term and adjustments to meetdecisions of the State Water Resources Control Board), and thus, for purposesof compliance with NEPA, the renewal of the contracts cannot be viewedas a ministerial act.\123\3. The Bureau of Reclamation's Procedures for Implementing the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act Normally Require Preparation of an EnvironmentalImpact Statement for Proposed Repayment Contracts and Water Service Contractsor Amendments for Irrigation where NEPA Compliance Has Not Already BeenAccomplished. This Provision Applies to the Renewal of Long-Term WaterContracts for the Friant Unit.As stated earlier, the CEQ NEPA regulations require each federal agencyto adopt its own NEPA procedures.\124\ In accordance with this requirement,the Department of the Interior has published NEPA procedures, approvedby CEQ, which include procedures applicable to the Bureau of Reclamation.As appropriate, the Bureau's NEPA procedures identify which activitieswill normally require an EIS. Among these activities are:<ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Proposed repayment contracts and water service contracts or amendmentsthereof, for irrigation, municipal, domestic, or industrial water, whereNEPA compliance has not already been accomplished.\125\</ITAG>This provision describes precisely the situation at issue in this referral,and should be utilized in connection with the renewal of the long-termwater contracts in the Friant Unit. Further, it is consistent with CEQ'sregulation that ``NEPA shall continue to be applicable to actions begunbefore January 1, 1970, to the fullest extent possible.'' \126\ The Bureau'sdirective to prepare EISs for proposed repayment and water service contractswhere NEPA compliance has not already been accomplished is also consistentwith the observations of the Supreme Court of the United States which statedin a recent decision interpreting NEPA that:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * the broad dissemination of information mandated by NEPA permitsthe public and other government agencies to react to the effects of a proposedaction at a meaningful time. [cite omitted] It would be incongruous withthis approach to environmental protection, and with the Act's manifestconcern with preventing uniformed action, for the blinders to adverse environmentaleffects, once unequivocally removed, to be restored prior to the completionof agency action simply because the relevant proposal has received initialapproval.\127\</ITAG>4. The Renewal of the Long-Term Water Contracts for the Friant Unit DoesNot Properly Fall Within the Department of the Interior's CategoricallyExclusions From NEPA Review.The CEQ regulations implementing NEPA direct agencies to identify thosetypical agency actions which may be categorically excluded from NEPA documentation.A ``categorical exclusion'' means:<ITAG tagnum="20">a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively havea significant effect on the human environment and which have been foundto have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal agency in implementationof these regulations [cite omitted] and for which, therefore, neither anenvironmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required** * * Any procedures under this section shall provide for extraordinarycircumstances in which a normally excluded action may have a significanteffect.\128\</ITAG>In this matter, the Department of the Interior has argued that the renewalof the Friant Unit contracts falls under the following Bureau categoricalexclusion.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approval, renewal, transfer, and execution of an original, amendatory,or supplemental water service or repayment contract where the only resultwill be to implement an administrative or financial practice or change.\129\</ITAG>Several factors negate that conclusion. First, what may appear to be twoinconsistent DOI/Bureau NEPA rules (one mandating preparation of an EISand the other categorically excluding the same action) are not inconsistentif read in the light of the CEQ regulation\130\ and relevant case law\131\directing that NEPA is applicable to actions commenced before its passage``to the fullest extent possible.'' Rather, the DOI/Bureau procedures indicatea commitment to prepare an EIS at the first reasonable opportunity on proposedrepayment and water service contracts which were executed without NEPAcompliance, and then, later approval, renewals, transfers or executionsor such contracts may, if consistent with the rest of the categorical exclusionprovisions, be exempted from further NEPA documentation.Second, the DOI/Bureau's NEPA procedures for categorical exclusions properlylist a number of exceptions which apply to individual actions within categoricalexclusions. These exceptions include actions which may:<ITAG tagnum="21">2.2 Have adverse effects on such unique geographic characteristicsas historic or cultural resources, park, recreation or refuge lands * ** wetlands, floodplains * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.3 Have highly controversial environmental effects;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.5 Establish a precedent for future action or represent a decisionin principle about future actions with potentially significant environmentaleffects;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.6 Be directly related to other actions with individually insignificantbut cumulatively significant environmental effects;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.8 Have adverse effects on species listed or proposed to be listedon the List of Endangered or Threatened Species, or have adverse effectson designated Critical Habitat for these species.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.9 Require compliance with Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management),Executive Order 11990 (Protection of Wetlands), or the Fish and WildlifeCoordination Act.\132\</ITAG>While this listing of exceptions is not meant to indicate that CEQ findseach of them applicable to either a particular CVP contact or the FriantUnit contracts or the CVP contracts as a whole, it does appear reasonable,based upon the cumulative evidence before us, that at least one or moreof these exceptions does apply to the renewal of the long-term water contracts.This conclusion is bolstered by Secretary Lujan's finding that , ``it mustbe recognized that the renewal of long-term water supply contracts poselegitimate environmental concerns.'' \133\5. The Secretary of the Interior Has Recognized That the Renewal of Long-TermWater Supply Contracts Poses Legitimate Environmental Concerns and HasDirected the Bureau of Reclamation to Conduct Assessment Studies Regardingthe Environmental Effects and to Explore Opportunities for EnvironmentalRecovery Programs. The Congressionally Mandated Framework for ConductingEnvironmental Analysis Is the National Environmental Policy Act.Secretary Lujan has recognized that the renewal of the long-term watercontracts ``pose legitimate environmental concerns,'' and has directedthe Bureau of Reclamation to conduct ``assessment studies to determineif any environmental effects result from deliveries of water under therenewed contract.'' \134\Congress enacted the statutory framework for studying environmental effectsof proposed federal actions when it passed NEPA in 1969. ``By its passageof the National Environmental Policy Act [cite omitted], the 91st Congressdeparted from the traditional single-solution treatment of environmentalproblems and set the stage for full-scale action to restore and maintainthe quality of the natural, as well as the manmade environment.'' \135\Congress took ``the major step of requiring all federal agencies to considervalues of environmental preservation in their spheres of activity, andit prescribes certain procedural measures to ensure that those values arein fact fully respected.'' \136\Over the years, the procedural mandate of the statute has been interpretedquite broadly. Courts have rejected arguments that NEPA does not applyto actions in circumstances similar to that presented in this referral.In one such case, the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) argued thatNEPA did not apply to its offer of long term (twenty year) contracts forpower delivery because Congress mandated it to offer contracts and BPAhad no discretion with respect to contract terms that might have varyingeffects upon the environment.\137\ The court noted that one of the difficultieswith BPA's position was the agency had noted in an environmental report(purporting to look at environmental effects of the renewal, but not withinthe framework of NEPA) that, ``the administrator possess a great deal ofdiscretion in contract matters.'' \138\ The court held that the contractsare significant federal action affecting the environment,\139\ and requiredBPA to prepare a full EIS.\140\Recommendations1. CEQ Recommends that the Bureau Prepare Environmental Impact Statementsfor Each of the Water Service Units of the Central Valley Project, Priorto the Renewal of the Individual Long-Term Water Contracts in that Unit,and That the Bureau Consider Whether a Programmatic EIS on All CentralValley Project Long-Term Contracts Would Be a Useful, Efficient Approach.CEQ Strongly Recommends Against Preparation of Individual EISs on EachSeparate Long-Term Water Contract.The Environmental Protection Agency, along with many other persons whosubmitted comments, has suggested that a programmatic EIS be prepared byDOI on all CVP long-term water contract renewals.\141\ While at first blushthis is an attractive concept, CEQ recommends that the Bureau considerthis suggestion carefully before proceeding with a programmatic EIS onall CVP renewals. Based upon the oral presentations made and the writtentestimony submitted to the Council, it appears that at least some of theunits_notably the Friant unit_have hydrological independence and otherfeatures which may make preparation of a programmatic EIS a less effectivemeans of assessing environmental impacts.\142\ Further, the dates of thecontract renewals are so widely spaced that a programmatic EIS preparednow could be outdated in part by the time later contracts had expired.On the other hand, certain aspects of the CVP contract renewals may bereasonably treated by the Bureau on a programmatic basis and may be significantin terms of the requirement to analyze the cumulative impacts of interrelatedactions.\143\ The Bureau's response to the State of California's new waterquality requirements for the San Joaquin-Sacramento-Delta basin might bebest analyzed on a programmatic basis. If the Bureau determines that aprogrammatic EIS would be useful for all or some aspects of the CVP project,it could then, of course, utilize the tiering process to analyze further,site-specific actions.\144\ Ultimately, the Bureau will have to determinethe scope of its environmental documentation by considering which geographical,environmental and legal parameters best support its decisionmaking process.Should the Bureau determine that a programmatic EIS is not appropriate,CEQ recommends preparation of an EIS for each water service unit (thatis, the Friant Unit, the Shasta Unit, etc.) This approach would allow foranalysis of cumulative impacts within hydrologically defined geographicareas, and the water repayment and water service contracts within thoseareas would appear to be reasonably interrelated actions.\145\The Council strongly recommends <T3>against</T3> preparation of individual EISs for each renewal of a long-termwater contract. Such an approach could result in a tremendous administrativeand paperwork burden, promote delay in Bureau proceedings, and trivializethe NEPA process. Further, it would encourage segmentation of importantcumulative impact analyses.2. The Bureau of Reclamation Should Define the ``No Action'' Alternativein the Environmental Impact Statements as the Renewal of the Long-TermContracts With No Significant Changes.While the formulation of alternatives is normally and appropriately leftto the lead agency to define in light of its own expertise and commentsreceived during the scoping process, CEQ believes that in this instanceit is important to comment on the formulation of the ``no action'' alternative.Under the CEQ regulations, an agency must include a ``no action'' alternativein any EIS.\146\ The appropriate interpretation of the ``no action'' alternativeinitially depends upon the nature and context of the federal agency proposalat issue. There are two basic situations which an agency may face: eitherthe agency is proposing to do something completely new (e.g., build a highway,construct a new facility), or the agency is proposing to continue, with,perhaps, some degree of modification or alteration, an action which isalready in existence (e.g., amendments to a forest management plan).In many respects, the situation at issue in this referral is analogousto the second type of situation_that is, a proposed action relating toa federal activity which is already in existence. CEQ has issued guidanceon the question of how the ``no action'' alternative is applied to thistype of situation. That guidance, in relevant part, states that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Section 1502.14(d) requires the alternatives analysis in the EIS to`include the alternative of no action'. There are two distinct interpretationsof `no action' that must be considered, depending on the nature of theproposal being evaluated. The first situation might involve an action suchas updating a land management plan with ongoing programs initiated underexisting legislation and regulations which will continue, even as new plansare being developed. In these cases, `no action' is `no change' from currentmanagement direction or level of management intensity. <T3>To construct an alternative that is based on no management at all wouldbe a useless academic exercise. Therefore, the `no action' alternativemay be thought of in terms of continuing with the present course of actionuntil that action is changed.</T3> Consequently, projected impacts of alternativemanagement schemes would be compared in the EIS to those impacts projectedfor the existing plan.\147\</ITAG>While the contract renewal question poses a slight different circumstancethan modification of a land management plan, the Council finds the analogymuch more persuasive in terms of meaningful analysis than a ``no action''alternative which presupposes a return to the Central Valley environmentbefore the construction of the CVP. CEQ recommends that the Bureau thereforedefine the ``no action'' alternative as renewal of the contracts on a statusquo basis. The Bureau should incorporate into this alternative whateverchanges in the terms of the contract would be required by Congressionalamendments to reclamation law and other applicable federal law since executionof the original contracts. Thus, the ``no action'' alternative can serveas a meaningful alternative itself and as a baseline for comparison withother alternatives, rather than just being a paperwork exercise.3. The Bureau of Reclamation Should Request the Appropriate Entities ofthe State of California To Be a Joint Lead or Cooperating Agency With theBureau of Purposes of Preparing the Environmental Impact Statement(s).As discussed above, the CEQ regulations mandate joint preparation of NEPAdocuments whenever possible and practicable.\148\ In this instance, closecooperation with the agencies of the State of California seems particularlyappropriate. Both DOI and EPA, as well as the vast majority of the commentators,have acknowledged the close relationship between the administration ofthe CVP water contracts and state water law. Indeed, the entire systemof irrigation for the Central Valley of California is a vast complex ofinterrelated state and federal law, administration and physical water transport,transfer, and diversion. Secretary Lujan has recognized this fact, andhas instructed the Commssioner of Reclamation to carry out the environmentalstudies he ordered ``in conjunction with the state and other interestedorganizations [so] that the findings will be considered by the state andthe districts as they adopt environmentally sensitive operating proceduresand water policies.''\149\ Conducting the NEPA process with the involvementof the State of California will produce better analysis and documentationand should ultimately lead to improved decisionmaking.Final Thoughts Throughout the course of this referral, there have been a number of inaccuratestatements made_many out of ignorance, fear, and confusion. CEQ wishesto take this opportunity to clarify what it is and what it is not doing.Consistent with the mandate of the National Environmental Policy Act, it<T3>is</T3> recommending that the Bureau prepare an environmental impactstatement(s) on the renewal of the long-term water contracts for the FriantUnit of the CVP, and other CVP units. It is not making any recommendationsregarding the allocation CVP water. Those decisions will be made by theCalifornia State Water Resources Control Board, consistent with federallaw.The Council is sensitive to the concerns and fears of the current waterusers and those contractors within the Friant Unit irrigation districtwho have wisely utilized the water provided by the CVP system to createone of the most fertile and productive agricultural systems in the world.CEQ does not believe that the current water users should fear that theCVP facilities will be dismantled or that CVP water will stop flowing totheir lands. Rather, CEQ agrees with Secretary Lujan's statement that ``Renewalof the Friant Unit contracts and protecting the environment are not mutuallyexclusive * * * *''\150\Implementation of NEPA over the past twenty years has not prevented, norwas it intended to prevent, continued development of natural resourcesto meet human needs. In fact, the very first stated purpose of NEPA is,``To declare a national policy which will encourage productive and enjoyableharmony between man and his environment * * *.''\151\ The analysis preparedunder NEPA is meant to ensure that the decisionmaker consider the environmentalimpacts of his or her decision, and that interested and affected parties(including water users, environmental groups, state and local governments,fishermen and water consumers and others) have an opportunity to participatein that process. The water contracts should be renewed and the NEPA processshould be implemented. All interested citizens and the environment willbenefit from both actions.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 29, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">A.

Schafer</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">With Respect to the Findings</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I cannot find that the Bureau's proposal and the Secretary's subsequentdecision to renew one of the pending Friant Unit water service contractsin the absence of preparing environmental analysis under section 102(2)(C)is an unreasonable interpretation of the applicability of NEPA, the agency'sown implementing procedures, Federal reclamation law, including the ReclamationProject Act of 1939 and the Act of June 2, 1956, and the terms and conditionsgoverning the United States permits from the State Water Resources ControlBoard. The Solicitors's conclusion that contract renewal is a ministerialact that retains the <T3>status quo </T3>is a fair reading of applicable law and falls withinthat agency's authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">CEQ's role under the referral process is not to interpret all of therelevant law, but to seek resolution of significant environmental issueswhen a disagreement about environmental impacts arises between federalagencies. That is, CEQ's role is more like that of a mediator than a judge.Although CEQ has been accorded deference concerning interpretation of NEPA,CEQ has no special expertise concerning federal reclamation law, statewater law, or the property status of water rights under the Constitution,which are also at issue legally in this matter. When all of this law isbrought to bear on the contract renewals, CEQ is hard pressed to justifysubstituting its legal judgment for that of the agency responsible formaking the decision to proceed with the contract.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The legal issue revolves around the nature and extent of the Secretary'sdiscretion, which is not exclusively a matter of NEPA interpretation. Thelegal constraints on his ability to choose from among meaningful alternativesfor various terms and conditions to be applied to the contract are notimposed by NEPA. Arguments have been presented about the degree of thisdiscretion, and its impact on the ``status quo'', but Interior's judgmentin this matter is not unreasonably applied to these contract renewals.Thus, while the referral presents CEQ with the opportunity to offer a contraryopinion, as a matter of policy we should exercise restraint in giving it.This is especially true in this case, where CEQ's opinion will not, byitself, provide the means to resolve the disagreement, which is the purposeof the referral procedure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">With Respect to the Recommendations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The documents received by CEQ in response to the referral raise anumber of issues, the importance of which can scarcely be overstated, concerningthe future use and allocation of water resources in California's CentralValley, and the environmental impacts of the possible alternatives forputting those resources to other uses, including the opportunity to restorewater quality, fisheries, wetlands and other wildlife habitat. In announcinghis decision to offer a renewal contract to the Orange Cove IrrigationDistrict, Secretary Lujan pledged to evaluate these issues, which can beexpected to have a profound influence on the nature of future Federal-Staterelationships concerning water resources.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Separate and apart from the Friant Unit contract renewals, it appearsthat there are other points in the course of agency decisionmaking affectingwater use that would present the occasion to incorporate such environmentalconsiderations, making the performance of environmental analysis meaningful.For example, the agency's proposal to adopt or make a change in its ratesetting policy applicable to board classes of water contracts providesan occasion to assess the environmental impacts of alternative non-quantitycontract terms. Had an environmental review been performed in the recentCVP Irrigation Water Ratesetting Policy (May 1988), for instance, a moremeaningful analysis of the potential impacts of this particular type ofcontract condition might have been available than would be likely for theFriant renewals alone.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the future, the establishment of the Federal Government's policyin response to the results of the (California) State Water Resources ControlBoard's investigation of Sacramento Delta/San Francisco Bay water qualityprovides another occasion to evaluate environmental impacts and avoidanceor mitigation measures that could be developed in concert with the State,which has the primary authority to determine basic water rights and entitlements.Recommendations for conservation measures (e.g., metering) and demand management(e.g., pricing) policies would have more utility in this context than inthat for contract renewals, where Federal agency discretion is far morehighly constrained.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the case of the Orange Cove contract renewal, for instance, itappears that all water delivered is used in accordance with state of theart water irrigation conservation technology, making the imposition offurther terms and conditions with respect to such conservation practicesunlikely to effect significant environmental changes. In fact, Friant Unitirrigation contractors appear to have practiced unusually effective waterconservation through their ``conjunctive use'' of groundwater withdrawaland recharge. On the other hand, this may not be the case of ``municipaland industrial'' contractors which distribute water for domestic consumptionwithout analogous incentives to conserve it.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Should California, as a result of the State Board's review, proposesignificant changes in its policies to appropriate water, there will beother opportunities to bring about changes in water use than through theseparticular contract renewals. For example, in the future, water marketingcould play a significant role in directing water to preferred uses. Otherways may prove to be possible that are not yet recognized as being available,but which could arise as a result of a cooperative Federal and State effortas pledged by the Secretary, consistent with protecting the valid propertyrights of water users.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Conclusion</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">My own views on the matter before the Council are sufficiently differentthat those set forth in the above-stated Findings and Recommendations thatI have determined not to sign that document and, instead, to give thisexplanation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 29, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jacqueline E.
