Venture capital funds could bring in as much as $2 billionin new money over the next six months, according to VentureCapital Journal, an industry newsletter in New York. Thatwould represent a sharp rise from the $1 billion in new moneythat the industry will raise all this year, according to thenewsletter's estimates. Funds raised have slipped in recentyears from a record $4.2 billion in 1987.</LP><TEXT>   Some venture funds have completed large new financings inrecent weeks. Oak Investment Management Corp., Westport,Conn., has raised $150 million.   Domain Partners, a Princeton, N.J., concern, has a new $75million pool. And J.H. Whitney andamp; Co., New York, earlier thisyear closed a new $135 million fund.   &quot;Fund raising for venture capitalists has been extremelydifficult the past two years and the first half of thisyear,&quot; says David Schutt, editor of Venture Capital Journal,an industry newsletter. A key factor in the industry'sproblems: too much money concentrated in a declining hightechindustry.   But this year's record market for new issues, many ofwhich are backed by venture capitalists, as well as the lowvaluations for private companies in the current climate, haveagain made venture capital projects attractive to manyinvestors.   New stock offerings have greatly enhanced the value andappeal of venture capital investments. Oak says that eightinitial public offerings in the past nine months have boostedits portfolio value by $180 million. Summit Partners, Boston,has seen the value of its investments in 11 companies soar by$150 million in 1991.   Burr Egan Deleage, Boston, says $5.7 million invested infive companies is worth over $50 million.   Of course, a major stock market decline could dententhusiasm for investments of all sorts. But the recentvolatility in the market shouldn't affect venturecapitalists' fund raising, Mr. Schutt says. &quot;They're workingon a much longer time frame,&quot; he adds.   ---   SMALL INVESTMENT BANKS help more regional firms raise newcapital.   Several of these banks say their activity in this field isat its highest level since the stock market boom of the early1980s. The banks specialize in transactions often too smallfor bigger institutions.   Dain Bosworth Inc., Minneapolis, has raised about $46million in five initial public offerings this year, its mostsince 1983.   J.C. Bradford andamp; Co., Nashville, Tenn., raised $55 millionfor four companies in 1991. And Josephthal, Lyon andamp; Ross, NewYork, says it raised $85 million for seven companies. Threeof Josephthal Lyon's deals this year were those that biggerbankers committed to but then abandoned, says Dan Purjes, itschief executive.   For the most part, smaller banks are targeting regionalcompanies, says Jim Pierpont, senior vice president of DainBosworth. &quot;We're focusing on companies that are trying toraise between $10 million and $20 million,&quot; adds Mr. Purjesof Josephthal Lyon. Many of these companies &quot;get to workclosely with our top management instead of being assigned ajunior banker,&quot; he says.   Smaller investment banks provide access to capital atrates more attractive than other sources, says venturecapitalist Steven Clearman, an investor in Restor IndustriesInc. The Orlando, Fla., supplier of telecommunicationsequipment recently raised $5.3 million via an offering by GKNSecurities Corp., a small New York investment bank.   ---   SMALL PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS benefit from accelerated drugapprovals.   Some 131 drugs are currently in clinical trials, theIndustrial Biotechnology Association estimates. The drugreview procedures designed by the Food and DrugAdministration to speed the approval of &quot;new drugs orbiologicals for serious or life threatening diseases&quot; couldshave significant time from the review process, especiallywhen the cash outlays are greatest, says Richard D. Godown,president of the trade group. For small companies that oftenhave limited capital and are counting on one or two drugs toget them started, the benefits would be particularlysignificant, he says.   Even a six-month reduction in the waiting time will savemillions for small companies, says David Hale, president andchief executive officer of Gensia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Thecosts of initial research and development won't change much,Mr. Hale says. But the ability to market a product earlierwill reduce total expenses and hasten the trek to profits, hesays. It also may translate into lower prices for patients.   The ability to go to the FDA with less test data couldsave as much as $10 million for a company like AutoImmuneInc., a Boston biotechnology concern researching a cure formultiple sclerosis.   &quot;It makes investing in biotechnology more attractive,&quot;says Barry Weinberg, a managing partner of CW Group, which isa major investor in AutoImmune.   ---   EVEN BIG leveraged buy-out funds are turning to smallerdeals.   The current shortage of bank loans and difficulty inselling junk bonds is forcing many large LBO funds towardsmaller transactions that they can finance mostly with theirown capital.   The trend, which started early this year, began &quot;when itbecame apparent that the shortage of bank financing was goingto be more persistent,&quot; says Steven Galante, editor ofPrivate Equity Analyst, a West Newton, Mass., newsletter.   Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., one of the major players in the bigbuy-outs in the 1980s, is competing for a $100 millionacquisition of a West Coast equipment manufacturer. Andothers such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., also arelooking at smaller transactions.   Sellers of smaller companies are looking at a broaderrange of buyers, says William Matthes, a partner of BrentwoodAssociates, a Los Angeles buy-out firm. But the presence ofmore buyers hasn't boosted prices yet, he adds.   Many buyers and lenders burned by overpaying in the 1980sare willing to put in more equity. Besides, there are moreopportunities in the $25 million to $100 million range, saysDan O'Connell, managing partner of Vestar Capital Partners, aNew York buy-out concern.   Vestar says it is buying only small companies to add toits existing portfolio. This year it bought Royal JamaicanTobacco and Te Amo Cigar Co. to add to its 1988 purchase ofConsolidated Cigar Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
