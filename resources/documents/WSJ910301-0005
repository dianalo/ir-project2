The chief rule-making body for accountants will probablydefer the mandatory implementation date for financialstatements to calendar 1993 from the current date of calendar1992, says Timothy Lucas, research director of the FASB,Norwalk, Conn.</LP><TEXT>   The rule, first detailed in 1987 and delayed forimplementation twice before, has encountered a storm ofcriticism from companies that complain that it's too complex,too expensive to implement and would confuse investors.   Under the rule as first proposed, companies wouldn't bepermitted to offset certain cost deductions from income withfuture expected tax benefits. The FASB is currently revisingthe deferred-tax rule so that this offsetting can be done,says James Leisenring, FASB vice chairman.   The offsetting will help ease the impact of the recentFASB rule requiring accrual, or setting up a reserve, forpost-retirement medical benefits. It would permit anoffsetting of future tax credits when the medical costs areactually paid out, FASB staff members note. Themedical-benefits rule is expected to reduce reportedcorporate profits by more than $200 billion starting in 1993.   Companies say they welcome the expected revisions in therule. &quot;The revised version should clear up some of theserious problems with the current FASB statement rule ondeferred taxes,&quot; says Eugene Flegm, assistant controller ofGeneral Motors Corp., Detroit, who has been a consistentcritic of the deferred-tax rule.</TEXT></DOC>
