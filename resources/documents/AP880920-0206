They were joined this week bygovernment employees with the same demand.   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidDefense Forces personnel are protecting Balboa, the Pacific Coastport of the Panama Canal. They said Vacamonte port police havetaken control of that small fishing port, 30 miles from Balboa.   Vacamonte workers are not on strike.   Balboa workers went on indefinite strike Sept. 12, demanding theannual bonus that was due in August.   On Monday, the 75,000-member National Federation of PublicEmployees said they would join the strike for 48 hours.   Federation undersecretary Jose Sanchez said workers at 80percent of the government institutions were taking part. About halfof those who collect taxes and utility payments continue to work tomake sure the government will have the revenues needed to pay them.   Employees at several government institutions told The AssociatedPress some people were working and some were not. The governmentmaintains public employees do not have a right to strike.   Sanchez said many striking public employees reported to work butdid not perform their duties.   In Panama City, private businesses operated normally.   Schools, closed by the government Monday, were in sessionTuesday.   The 15,000-member Defense Forces, the country's armed forces,said in a statement it ``will guarantee that public servicecontinues normally.   ``Units of the police force offered to provide necessaryvigilance to ensure that every state dependency, public service andthe public in general have the necessary protection to carry outtheir functions,'' the statement said.   Sanchez said he was trying to gain the release of five Balboalabor leaders arrested over the weekend.   Besides demanding bonus payments, federation members also askedthat the government be restructured, accusing it of administrativecorruption.   The pro-government newspaper El Diario Matutino said Tuesdaythat sectors of the federation rushed into ``an adventure'' bystarting a strike that ``did not reach the level they expected.''   ``Many of the official institutions operated on time and withfull personnel. Others worked partially,'' it said.   Another Panama City daily, La Estrella de Panama, said thestrikes ``are counterproductive at a time when the country facesthe worst economic crisis in its history and is confronted by theimplacable aggression of the most powerful nation in the world.''   The United States has been trying to force Gen. Manuel AntonioNoriega to quit as Defense Forces chief, a post that makes himPanama's de facto leader. Noriega is under U.S. indictment on drugtrafficking charges. Among the pressures Washington applied wereeconomic sanctions.</TEXT></DOC>
