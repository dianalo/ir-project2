O'Connor, whose sermon wasdisrupted by abortion-rights and AIDS activists inside St.Patrick's Cathedral, said demonstrators would halt services ``overmy dead body.''   City officials also denounced the activists, who sprawled in theaisles of the cathedral during Sunday Mass. Some of thedemonstrators chained themselves to pews or hurled condoms. Onethrew a Communion wafer on the floor.   ``If their aim is to change church teaching, they can'taccomplish that,'' O'Connor said Monday.   About 4,500 marched outside, protesting the Roman CatholicChurch's policies on AIDS, abortion, contraception andhomosexuality, and 111 were arrested, 43 inside the church.   Mayor Edward Koch, mayor-elect David Dinkins and Gov. MarioCuomo were among those calling the demonstration inside thecathedral an affront to religion and an infringement on worshipers'First Amendment rights.   Koch, who attended the Mass to demonstrate his support though heis Jewish, said: ``To think that you're going to change the beliefsof the Catholic church by disrupting a service makes no sense andit is not acceptable. It doesn't come in under any protected FirstAmendment rights.''   Said Dinkins: ``A peaceful demonstration, an expression of one'sviews, is one thing, but one ought not disrupt a religiousceremony.''   Cuomo, while noting ``terrible anguish of AIDS'' and the``complex and emotional'' debate on abortion, said: ``Even theawful provocation emanating from these issues does not justify theoutrage of desecrating, egregiously, a religious service and itsworshipers.''   The protest was organized by two groups known for vocaldemonstrations, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (Act-Up) andWomen's Health Action and Mobilization (Wham!).   O'Connor called the demonstration the worst of many he had seenat the cathedral.   ``They will stop the Mass over my dead body,'' he said.   ``I can't imagine a day that the church will change its positionon contraception,'' O'Connor said. ``The church will certainly notchange its position on homosexual behavior. It will not change itsposition on abortion.''   Even some of the protesters said those inside St. Patrick's wenttoo far.   John Kelly, a spokesman for Act-Up, acknowledged that ``a lot inthe group were disturbed by what went on (inside the cathedral).But that's their right to protest.''   ``We weren't attempting in any way to change the church'steaching,'' Kelly said. ``But (O'Connor is) taking church teachingand forcing it on the people of New York City who don't necessarilyshare his beliefs.''   He said the church's attitude fostered ignorance about AIDS.   Andy Humm, spokesman for the Coalition for Lesbian and GayRights, said the 50-group coalition supported the protest outdoors,but ``unequivocably condemned'' the splinter group inside St.Patrick's.   Humm said the cardinal's position on AIDS education and abortion``must be protested vigorously, but that does not excuse theviolation of anyone's right to pray as they choose.''</TEXT></DOC>
