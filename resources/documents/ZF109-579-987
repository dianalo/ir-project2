 Send and receive faxes without leaving your desk.andO;DID delivery to users on the LAN.andP;  MHS connectivity.andM;Faxshare Version 2.0andM;Version 2.0 of FaxShare, which was due October 1990, includes the followingnew features, according to Ken Hilliard, chief executive officer of ShareCommunications:andM;* A greatly enhanced server screen.andM;* A remote console capability that makes it possible to view the serverscreen from any station on the network.andM;* Elimination of the requirement for a hard disk at the fax server.andM;* MHS support.andM;* Ability to send HPPCL files.andM;* Windows 3.0 support and Windows programming interfaces.andP;  (DOS programminginterfaces are currently available.)andM;* A &quot;faxmerge&quot; feature that allows the fax server to take addressinginformation from a comma delimited text file.andM;* Support for the GammaLink board.andM;Fax servers are a great idea.andP;  Instead of a lining up to feed paper into afax machine, employees stay at their own PCs and feed files (or redirectprinter output) to a central fax server over the LAN.andP;  Everyone can faxsimultaneously.andP;  A fax can be sent to a group of recipients in a singleoperation.andP;  Text files and graphics files can be combined in a singleoutgoing fax.andP;  And outgoing faxes can be scheduled for delivery at a latertime, even after working hours, when phone calls are cheaper.andM;Incoming faxes are also stored as files on the network server.andP;  This makes itpossible to edit them and/or incorporate them into other documents.andP;  If,after looking at an incoming fax, you decide it's junk mail, you can deleteit without wasting paper.andP;  If you want others to look at a fax you get, youcan forward it to an entire group simultaneously, without visiting thecopying machine and still without generating a scrap of paper.andM;Some fax servers even provide a means of delivering incoming faxes throughDirect Inward Dial (DID) numbers.andP;  DID is designed to allow a Private BranchExchange (PBX) to receive calls for many phone numbers on a single trunkline, and then route those calls to the proper internal phone line.andO;Typically, after the connection is made between the PBX and the centraloffice switch, the central office sends a series of Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency(DTMF) signals to the PBX indicating to which phone the call should berouted.andP;  Fax servers that use DID for routing faxes simply associate aparticular DID number with a user on the LAN, instead of with a phone.andP;  Thus,using a single trunk line and DID service (no PBX is required), faxes can berouted to the correct users.andM;It may also be possible to provide the DTMF tones manually on non-DID lines.andO;This provides individual routing capability with privacy and without humanintervention on the receiving end.andP;  However, the sender has to go to someextra work.andP;  In addition, it may be impossible to program many fax machinesto pause correctly before sending the DTMF tones.andP;  Most fax machines willpermit you to dial manually, but how many users want to go to that trouble?andO;In addition, PC-based fax systems usually don't support manual dialing.andP;  Thefact that many senders can't or won't provide DTMF manually is not a fatalproblem on the receiving end, since faxes that come in with no DTMF tones orwith improper DTMF tones can be routed to a default user, who can thenmanually forward those faxes to their recipients.andP;  So, those who want to usemanual DTMF can, while others don't have to.andM;The initial cost for installing the DID lines and the monthly charge for eachDID number should be considered.andP;  There's also usually a hefty penalty if youkeep the service for less than a specified period of time, such as threeyears.andP;  Usually, the only less expensive alternative is to allow users torummage through one another's faxes, looking for their own.andP;  This bothviolates privacy and wastes a tremendous amount of time.andP;  It's much moreefficient to have a single employee go through all faxes and route them totheir proper recipients.andP;  If an employee has to manually forward largenumbers of faxes every day, the employee's time may cost more than DIDservice.andP;  In any case, it's nice to have the DID option for the day that youdecide the manual approach isn't working.andM;As I said, fax servers are a great idea.andP;  However, real fax server productsinevitably fall short of the ideal.andP;  (See &quot;Fax or Opinions,&quot; LAN Magazine,June 1990, page 130.)andM;This review examines two fax servers that support DID--FaxShare from ShareCommunications and Netfax Manager from OAZ Communications.andP;  FaxShare is afull-featured, workable product, with one or two rough edges.andP;  In particular,its server screen is hard to interpret.andP;  I also ran across a few bugs.andP;  Allin all, though, I'd recommend FaxShare to a friend.andM;Although I had a few problems with Netfax Manager that seemed serious at thetime, looking back with the calm dispassion of hindsight, I would stillrecommend it to a friend, under the condition that he or she promises not toworry too much if things seem to be going screwy at first: Netfax Managerdoes work.andP;  Most of my problems, as it turned out, were related to theMessage Handling Service (MHS) that Netfax Manager uses to communicate withits own user program and with other MHS-based applications such as e-mail.andM;OAZ did not provide the MHS software.andP;  I used an old version of NetWare MHS(version 1.1Nb) that I had lying around.andP;  (OAZ actually specifies version1.1Nc or later.)andP;  A newer version I had requested didn't arrive in time forthe review.andM;Netfax may be especially attractive if you already have MHS installed andworking.andP;  The program worked properly once it and MHS were correctlyinstalled and configured.andM;InstallationandM;I installed FaxShare on two machines: the fax server and the file server.andO;Netfax Manager installs on the file server only.andP;  The workstation from whichit is installed is irrelevant.andM;I had more trouble installing Netfax Manager than FaxShare.andP;  In fact, I hadno trouble at all installing FaxShare, while I ran into several snags withNetfax Manager.andM;When I first tried to install Netfax, it failed with this message: &quot;errorcode returned: 1; press any key:&quot;.andP;  I escaped from Netfax and unloaded theNetfax server software from memory.andP;  However, the machine began printingeverything that appeared on the screen.andP;  I logged out.andP;  Netfax gave me a &quot;notready reading device PRN&quot; error.andP;  Apparently, the Netfax function that printsincoming faxes had not unloaded completely.andP;  After a warm boot, the DOSstartup routine never got as far as displaying the DOS prompt.andP;  It took acold boot to set the machine right again.andM;After roaming around through the configuration menus looking for possibleproblems, I made a second attempt.andP;  This resulted in the following errormessage:andM;error 000fh in path.c (423):H: \nfserver \receive.*andM;Installation failedandM;I called OAZ's technical support, who determined that different parts ofNetfax were having a disagreement over whether it should run from drive H: ordrive I:.andP;  Apparently, while roaming around in the configuration program, Ihad inadvertently changed some of the default drives.andP;  Once Netfax had itsdrives straight, it installed with no more errors.andM;The MHS DifferenceandM;Netfax Manager uses the Message Handling Service (MHS) developed by ActionTechnologies (Emeryville, Calif.) and supported by Novell as NetWare MHS.andO;This means that any MHS application can send faxes through Netfax Manager.andO;There are two ways of doing this.andP;  One is through the &quot;extended addressmode,&quot; in which the address of the final recipient is enclosed in curlybrackets, quotes, or some other delimiter, after the address of theintermediary.andP;  For instance, you could send a fax from DaVinci e-Mail likethis:andM;TO:FAX&quot;FAX: 1-213-555-5555&quot;andM;The numbers are the fax number of the recipient.andP;  There is also an option forincluding the name and company of the recipient, like this:andM;TO:FAX&quot;peterj/FAX: 1-213-555-5555/Acme Toys Inc.&quot;andM;The information enclosed in curly braces or quotation marks can be taken fromthe e-mail address book, so you don't have to type it in each time.andM;For MHS applications that do not support the extended address mode, you canembed fax commands in the message text, as the first non-blank line of text.andO;Netfax Manager recognizes this embedded information because it starts withtwo &quot;at&quot; signs, like this:andM;@@ FAX 1-213-555-5555 or @@ FAX 1-213-555-5555; peterj; Acme Toys Inc.andM;Normally, MHS runs on a dedicated server.andP;  However, the Netfax Manager serverruns MHS periodically, functioning both as an MHS server and as a fax server.andO;You still need a modem for non-fax MHS messages; the OAZ board does notdouble as a modem.andP;  You can run MHS on a separate server, if you want.andP;  Thismight be necessary, for instance, if you want the MHS server to wait forincoming calls.andP;  If MHS is being used only for outgoing calls, you stillmight want to put MHS on a separate machine in order to leave the faxdedicated solely to fax activities.andM;Most other MHS applications cannot usefully receive messages through NetfaxManager.andP;  They would receive Group III fax files as attachments and would notbe able to display them properly.andP;  A useful addition to Netfax Manager wouldbe a utility for converting Group III fax files to PCX files, so MHS userscould receive faxes as well as send them.andM;Netfax Manager's MHS connection opens up a world of possibilities.andP;  However,it does mean that you have to obtain and install MHS before you can useNetfax Manager.andP;  NetWare users can get MHS free from Novell.andP;  Others canpurchase it from Action Technologies.andM;I had some trouble with MHS when I first installed it and tried to use itwith Netfax Manager.andP;  MHS gave contradictory information about whether a usernamed FAX existed.andP;  When I used the MHSUSER utility to see if the FAX userexisted, I was told it did.andP;  When I tried to send mail to that user, however,he seemed to have disappeared.andP;  MHS had never heard of him.andP;  Netfax Managerexperienced this same problem, which is quite serious, since Netfax Managerreceives faxes from its user program (and other MHS applications) through theFAX user.andM;OAZ's technical support was always available on the first call with almost nowaiting, and they tried to be helpful.andP;  However, they seemed to know NetfaxManager better than MHS.andP;  In the process of working with OAZ, however, I diddiscover some interesting capabilities of Netfax Manager.andM;In particular, you can send faxes directly through Netfax Manager, withoutinvolving MHS.andP;  By using embedded commands, I could copy outgoing MHSmessages from the \MHS\MAIL\OUT directory to the \NFSERVER\TEXT directory andNetfax would then send the MHS message and file as a fax.andM;Then I found out I didn't even have to use MHS.andP;  I could simply create a textfile with embedded commands in \NFSERVER\TEXT, and Netfax would send the fax.andO;Thus, I could send a fax directly from WordPerfect, simply by creating anASCII file.andP;  That's what I call an open interface.andP;  There's even a way tosend files by putting them in the \NFSERVER\ATTACH directory and embedding anATTACH command in the text file.andM;Eventually, I did solve my MHS problem.andP;  I went into the MHS DirectoryManager and saw that no user named FAX was displayed there.andP;  I added a usernamed FAX, and Netfax Manager started working.andP;  (Note that adding the FAXuser through MHSUSER had not done the job.)andP;  It turns out that MHS andMHSUSER have two different ways of determining whether a user exists.andO;MHSUSER looks at the directory structure; if the proper directories arethere, MHSUSER says that user exists.andP;  The MHS Directory Manager, on theother hand, looks at a file called NETDIR.TAB.andP;  My problem was that the userFAX had the proper directories but had not been added to NETDIR.TAB.andP;  Byusing the MHS Directory Manager, I was able to put the FAX user intoNETDIR.TAB.andM;Netfax Manager's user program is a special version of Para-Mail, from ParadoxDevelopment in San Diego, Calif.andP;  (see sidebar).andP;  At first, this MHS-basede-mail failed to send faxes because of the problem with MHS, but it wassuccessful after MHS was straightened out.andM;Sending and ReceivingandM;Sending files as faxes and converting received faxes into files are crucialfunctions for a fax server.andP;  FaxShare and Netfax Manager differ in the kindsof files they can accept and create, although they appear to be converging inupcoming versions.andM;In addition, using a product such as Hijaak from Inset Systems (Brookfield,Conn.), you may be able to convert existing files into the format yourequire.andP;  Hijaak converts files to and from 36 formats, including HPPCL(Hewlett-Packard Printer Control Language), TIFF (Tag Image File Format),PCX, Intel's DCX, and Group III formats for the Brooktrout, Intel, and OAZboards.andP;  (Hijaak costs $199 for a single-user license and $995 for unlimitedusers on a single server.)andP;  Share Communications is planning to licenseHijaak to implement a transparent translation capability at the server,according to Ken Hilliard, chief executive officer of Share.andM;Netfax supports six send options.andP;  You can send files in ASCII, HPPCL, TIFF,or bit-map formats.andP;  You can scan images for faxing.andP;  Finally, you canredirect output that would normally go to a printer.andP;  Netfax stores allincoming files in Group III fax format, which makes it possible to resendentire incoming faxes, but not to edit, cut out parts, use with otherprograms, or work with them page by page.andM;(Version 3.0 of Para-Mail will include some graphics editing capabilities.andO;It will also store files in TIFF format, which can be edited with PCPaintbrush IV or IV Plus.andP;  PC Paintbrush can then store the file in TIFF orPCX format.)andM;FaxShare can send PCX and ASCII files with the Intel Connection Coprocessor.andO;It can also capture and fax printer output or scan images for faxing usingany Cannon-compatible scanner, such as the HP ScanJet.andP;  With the Brooktroutboard, FaxShare can also send TIFF and Postcript files.andP;  Version 2.0 ofFaxShare can send HPPCL via print capture, too, using either board.andO;(Currently, the print capture emulates an Epson printer.andP;  HPPCL means thatthe print capture will emulate an HP LaseJet.)andM;With the Intel board, FaxShare can store incoming files either in PCX formator the Intel DCX format.andP;  With the Brooktrout, it can also store incomingfiles in TIFF or Postcript formats.andM;The main advantage of Group III fax or DCX files is that a multipage incomingfax can be stored in a single file.andP;  Group III fax files also take somewhatless space than PCX or DCX files: perhaps 30KB per page with Group III versus50KB to 100KB or more for PCX or DCX.andM;With the PCX format, every page of the incoming fax becomes a separate file.andO;While having lots of little files instead of few big files might seeminconvenient, it can be useful in some instances.andP;  For example, you may wantto keep only a few pages of fax.andP;  When FaxShare faxes are stored in PCXformat, you can delete the pages you don't want.andP;  This can save a lot of diskspace.andP;  With FaxShare, too, individual pages or groups of pages can be viewedand sent out again, in any order.andP;  You can also use PC Paintbrush, or anyprogram that accepts PCX files, to edit the received faxes.andP;  Pages, or partsof pages, can be included in desktop publishing documents, since many desktoppublishing packages accept PCX files.andP;  (However, received faxes have the sameresolution as fax copy produced by real fax machines, and the same resultingloss and distortion of detail.)andM;Many users may have no need to do anything with incoming faxes but read themand either print or delete them.andP;  They will get no benefit from being able tostore incoming faxes as PCX files.andP;  For those who want to fiddle with theirfaxes a bit, having them in separate pages in PCX format is great.andM;Printer capture allows you tofax files created by any program that can print,including PC Paintbrush or any other graphics program.andP;  I tested this featureusing WordPerfect version 4.2 and Publishers Paiintbrush version 7.41 (fromZ-Soft in Atlanta, the company that makes PC Paintbrush).andM;Netfax did have one quirk in its print capture: It added the words &quot;METROSOFTWARE&quot; several times in each received fax.andP;  On the WordPerfect fax, itcovered up part of the WordPerfect text.andP;  Metro Software is the company thatwrote the software to convert the print capture file into HPPCL format.andP;  Ididn't know whether to regard the addition of the name to the received fax asa feature, a bug, or a publicity stunt.andP;  As a publicity stunt or a bug, itsucceeded.andP;  As a feature, it was a failure.andM;As it turned out, I had bumped up against yet another copy protection scheme.andO;Netfax messes up the received faxes by printing &quot;METRO SOFTWARE&quot; until youregister your software.andP;  (This occurs only with print capture files, as faras I can tell.)andP;  OAZ says that the server and user programs will also startto act strangely after about 30 days if you do not register them.andM;User InterfacesandM;Fax servers generally have three kinds of functions, often separated intothree programs: the user program, which allows users to send and receivefaxes; the administrative program, which allows the administrator toconfigure the system, view activity logs, route faxes, and a variety of othertasks; and the server program, which actually sends and receives faxes.andP;  Theserver and administrative programs may be combined.andP;  Each program has its ownuser interface, and the interfaces may be quite different.andP;  FaxShare is anextreme example of this, with very nice administrative and user interfacesand a poor server interface.andP;  Netfax has two user interfaces: theserver/administrative interface and the user interface.andP;  Both are somewhatcomplex, but after a while, I found myself using them successfully.andM;All in all, I'd probably give both companies a &quot;B&quot; in the user interfacedepartment.andP;  Share achieves its grade as an average of two &quot;A&quot; and a &quot;D&quot;.andO;OAZ scores two &quot;B&quot;s.andP;  Both Share and OAZ are planning to release a Windows3.0 version--late 1990 for Share and late 1990 or early 1991 for OAZ.andP;  (OAZ'sWindows user program will not be the upcoming version of Para-Mail forWindows, but a different program developed by OAZ.)andM;The server screen is an important aspect of a fax server.andP;  This screen,displayed at the dedicated fax server machine, helps you figure out what yourfax server is doing when it is running.andP;  Netfax has a reasonable fax serverscreen, which can keep track of four boards at the same time, providinginformation such as the board's status (such as when it is in auto-receivemode or transmitting), the current activity (such as translating a file intoHPPCL format), the name of the file (if any) currently being processed, andso on.andP;  In addition, using the first letters of various commands (Help,Queue, Log, Incoming-log, Outgoing-log, etc.), you can accomplish severaladministrative and server monitoring functions, such as examining the queueof faxes waiting to go out, examining logs of faxes that have come in or goneout, and so on.andP;  The available commands are displayed at the bottom of thescreen.andP;  Once I had worked with the Netfax server screen for a while, I foundit easy to interpret and use.andM;The FaxShare server screen, on the other hand, simply displays messages lineby line as each activity takes place.andP;  As new messages are displayed, oldones simply roll off the top of the screen.andP;  Many of the messages areobscure.andP;  Don't bother looking them up in the documentation, either; theyaren't there.andP;  The result is a screen that is difficult to interpret.andP;  I hada hard time, for example, determining when a fax was coming in unless I waspresent when the phone rang.andP;  I also could not tell a successfully receivedfax from a failed one by looking at the server screen.andP;  One person, who wasworking with me and did not know that the machine was being used as a faxserver, took one look at the FaxShare server screen, hit a few keys and gotno response, and decided that some poor program had been tromped on by analien force.andP;  She put it out of its misert with a warm boot.andM;FaxShare's barbaric server screen is shocking contrast to the screens forFaxShare's other main programs, the administrative program (FSADMIN) and theuser program (FS).andP;  Both have user interfaces that are nice looking and easyto use.andP;  Share Communications says the server screen in FaxShare version 2.0is up to the standards of the other two screens.andM;NotificationandM;As with e-mail, fax servers have to be able to notify users when faxes arrivefor them.andP;  FaxShare achieves this on NetWare LANs through the NetWare SENDcommand.andP;  (On other types of LANs, it uses very small TSR at eachworkstation.)andP;  The SEND command causes a message to pop up on the bottom lineof the screen, like this:andM;andgt;andgt; Fax Alert: Received Fax (FAXGWY005) (CRTL-ENTER to clear)andM;This notification method has some disadvantages.andP;  Most notably, it stops anyproceesing on the machine when it arrives.andP;  If you leave your machine toprocess a long job, you may find the job is not finished when you come back.andO;You can use the NetWare CASTOFF command to prevent any messages from comingin.andP;  Later, when you execute the CASTON command, all the messages will comein.andM;For received messages, FaxShare sends the same type of message (as shownabove) whether the fax was successfully received or not.andP;  The only differencefor a failed fax is that the parenthesis are empty after the words &quot;ReceivedFax.&quot;andP;  FaxShare should display a different message for faxes that are notreceived successfully.andM;Netfax has a 12KB TSR portion of its user interface that handlesmodification.andP;  A message (&quot;New Mail!&quot; followed by the number of messages)flashes quickly on the screen and simultaneously the machine emits adistinctive series of beeps.andP;  The message continues to flash over and over atuser definable intervals until you retrieve the message, but the beep onlysounds the first time.andP;  I liked this method of notification far better thanthe one used by FaxShare.andM;Popping UpandM;Both products offer the user program as a TSR, so it can be accessed from anyapplication for sending or receiving mail or faxes.andP;  TSRs are a mixedblessing.andP;  They are certainly convenient, but if you try to use more than oneon a single machine, they can conflict with one another.andP;  There are a numberof techniques and products for managing TSRs, and you can usually make themwork together if you're willing to invest the time and money.andM;I didn't test the Netfax TSR with other TSRs.andP;  It did not interfere with anyof the non-TSR programs I tried, including WordPerfect, Advanced Revelation,and the NetWare PCONSOLE utility.andP;  It appears to be stable and well-behavedin general.andP;  FaxShare uses LANSystem's 5KB LANSelect TSR.andP;  The first versionthat I received did not work.andP;  I didn't crash; it just gave me error messageswhenever I tried to do anything.andP;  However, it turned out that I had been sentan older version of LANSelect.andP;  An updated version I received did work.andP;  Itallowed me to run the FaxShare administrative program, look at the fax log,do print capture, and run the user program.andP;  In addition, it was configuredto allow me to run the NetWare PCONSOLE utility and administer the TSRitself.andM;Both programs offer the choice of using the TSR or not.andP;  However, in bothcases, print capture requires a TSR.andM;Flipping FaxesandM;Faxes often arrive upside down and need to be flipped.andP;  Both programs allowyou to do this.andP;  Netfax, however, only supports this function in theserver/administrator program.andP;  This would be a particular problem forinstallations using the DID feature, because there would be no human operatorusing the server/administrator program to look at each fax.andP;  FaxShare allowsyou to flip faxes with both the user and the administrative programs.andP;  Thus,users can get their faxes right side up whether faxes are routed manually orusing the DID.andM;OAZ says fax-flipping in the user program will be available in the nextrelease of the software.andM;Rough EdgesandM;Both programs did a number of curious things from time to time.andP;  Several ofNetfax's quirks have already been mentioned: problems during installation andputting the words &quot;METRO SOFTWARE&quot; into PCX files, for instance.andM;FaxShare also did a few unusual things.andP;  At one point, the user programstarted flashing at me--every menu on the screen was continuously flashing onand off.andP;  I got out of the program, and when I came back in later it wasstill flashing.andP;  It even continued to flash after I warm-booted the machineand started the user program again.andP;  It took a cold boot to get rid of theflashing.andM;At another point, I tried to route a FaxShare message to the supervisor,which was one of the choices FaxShare gave me.andP;  FaxShare told me:andM;SYSTEM ERROR [REN]: Unable to route Fax (RCF) to USER [RENAME] Press ESCandM;It turns out that FaxShare truncates user names longer than eight characters,so it can't cope properly with the name &quot;supervisor.&quot;andP;  Future versions willnot have this problem, according to Hilliard.andM;Just the FactsandM;I had moments of frustration with both FaxShare and Netfax, but both finallyworked.andP;  FaxShare has a nicer looking user interface, sends abd creates PCXfiles,and allows users to flip their own faxes.andP;  Netfax Manager can sendfaxes for other MHS applications, and can even send faxes directly just bycreating a simple ASCII file.andM;Both vendors are working hard to upgrade their products.andP;  With FaxSharecoming out with MHS support and Para-Mail introducing TIFF format receivefiles and graphics editing, the functionality of these products mayultimately be very similar.andP;  Or the vendors may have to find new ways todistinguish themselves.andP;  For me, the most salient distinctions are Netfax'sMHS connectivity and FaxShare's PCX receive files.andM;Michael Hurwicz is a consultant and freelance writer specializing innetworks.andP;  He is based in Eastsound, Wash.andM;Common GroundandM;Netfax Manager and FaxShare have several features in common.andP;  They both:andM;* Require a special fax board, which is installed in a dedicated fax serverPC.andP;  Fax server software runs on this PC.andM;* Allow all users on the LAN to send and receive faxes through the faxserver.andM;* Support delivery to individual users on the LAN through DID numbers.andP;  (Idid not test this feature.)andM;* Fax text or graphics files.andM;* Support sending to groups.andM;* Can redirect printer output from applications to the fax board.andM;* Allow the user program to run in memory-resident or non-memory-residentmode.andP;  In memory-resident mode, the user program can pop up from within anyapplication for sending or viewing faxes or mail messages.andM;* Offer an &quot;address book&quot; function so that you don't have to remember faxphone numbers.andM;* Stamp incoming messages with the current time and date.andM;* Support forwarding of messages.andM;* Allow you to integrate your logo or signature with faxes files.andM;Uncommon GroundandM;Some of the main differences between the two programs are:andM;* FaxShare has two great user interfaces and one lousy user interface.andO;Netfax Manager has two good user interfaces.andM;* Netfax Manager uses OAZ's own proprietary fax board.andP;  FaxShare can useeither Intel's Connection Coprocessor or the Brooktrout board, fromBrooktrout Technology (Needham, Mass.).andP;  (FaxShare supports DID routing andsome file formats only with the Brooktrout board.)andM;* Netfax Manager supports four fax boards in a single machine.andP;  Each boardsupports a single line.andP;  FaxShare supports up to eight Brooktrout boards,each of which has two lines.andP;  The Intel Connection Coprocessor software iscurrently limited to one board per PC, though Intel plans a four-boardimplementation, which FaxShare will be able to use, according to KenHilliard, chief executive officer of Share Communications.andM;* Any MHS-compatible application can send faxes through Netfax.andP;  WithFaxShare, you can send using the FaxShare user program only.andP;  Version 2.0 ofFaxShare will support MHS, according to Hilliard.andM;* FaxShare can save received faxes in PC Paintbrush (PCX) format.andP;  NetfaxManager can't.andM;* Netfax can send files that are stored in ASCII, HPPCL, TIFF, or bit-mapformats.andP;  It can't send PCX files.andP;  With the Intel board, FaxShare can sendASCII or PCX files only.andP;  With the Brooktrout board, it can also send TIFFand Postscript files.andM;* The Netfax function for &quot;flipping&quot; faxes that come in upside down is in theserver/administrator software.andP;  In FaxShare, it's in the user andadministrative programs.andM;* Both boards allow the sender to manually provide DTMF tones for DID-likedelivery.andP;  OAZ promotes this ability, pointing to the economy of avoiding DIDcosts.andP;  Share Communications, in contrast, discourages it, noting that manyof the originating fax systems will not support it conveniently or at all.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
