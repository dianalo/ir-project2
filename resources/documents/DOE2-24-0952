Thermal contact conductance between molybdenum tile and stainlessstructure is obtained experimentally. Thermal and stress analyses arecarried out to obtain the temperature and stress distributions in thefirst wall structure by using such results. It is clarified that thermalstress is reduced considerably by present new cooling configurationsand using liquid metal mist cooling.</TEXT></DOC>
