Pan Am Corp., the airline's parent, said its Teamster-represented employees were working on new terms imposed by the company, including wage and other cost reductions equivalent to $35 million a year. &quot;There were no disruptions of service,&quot; a Pan Am spokesman said.    After the meeting, a spokesman for the National Mediation Board said it had requested each of the parties to &quot;re-evaluate its position&quot; and resume negotiations at a later date.    &quot;As far as we're concerned, (negotiations are) over,&quot; said William F. Genoese, director of the airline division of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. He said that productivity will be going down, adding: &quot;Our internal strike has started.&quot; Mr. Genoese said a majority of union members voted Friday to authorize the strike that was to have begun yesterday.    But unions representing other Pan Am employees failed to support the Teamsters and indicated that their members wouldn't honor picket lines. Pan Am recruited and trained replacements for Teamsters union members in the event of a strike, and said it would make all its scheduled flights. </TEXT></DOC>
