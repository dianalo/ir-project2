Reports on rebel-run Voice of the Black Rooster radio, monitoredin Luanda from the guerrillas' bush headquarters of Jamba, said therebels asked mediating President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire to allowthem one week of ``necessary consultations.''   The talks, held in Kinshasa, Zaire's capital, started Wednesday.It was the second session between the U.S.-backed rebels of theNational Union for the Total Independence of Angola andrepresentatives of Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.   According to reports in Kinshasa the talks are to resume on July31.   The reports said the rebels wanted to discuss Mobutu's proposalsfor a ``hot line'' radio link between Luanda, Jamba and Kinshasa tohelp monitor a June 24 cease-fire agreed to by rebel leader JonasSavimbi and dos Santos.   The talks were held behind closed doors but reports from Zairesaid the government delegation, headed by armed forces chiefAntonio dos Santos Franca, accepted Mobutu's proposal.   There was no immediate confirmation from the Angolan governmentor the official media in Luanda.   Dos Santos withdrew his delegation from the first round of talksin Kinshasa on July 1, after only two days, claiming the rebels hadviolated the truce.   Reports of cease-fire violations continued as the second roundended on Saturday.   The Angolan state news agency, ANGOP, reported that anunspecified number of civilians were killed, wounded or missing inguerrilla attacks in four northern and central provinces.   The rebels have said government forces also have violated thecease-fire.   Both sides also are at odds about what they agreed to in theaccord containing the cease-fire.   The Angolan government claims Savimbi pledged to leave thecountry temporarily, while members of his movement return tocivilian life.   Savimbi has denied that he agreed to exile and rebel spokesmenhave rejected integration, calling instead for the formation of atransitional government comprised of members from both sides toprepare general elections.   The rebels have been fighting to share control since a Marxistgovernment took power shortly after Angola's independence fromPortugal in 1975.   The guerrillas have not explicitly stated their political andeconomic philosophy, but they generally are pro-Western, favor amulti-party democracy with regular elections and appear to supporta mixed economy.   The United States sends military aid to the rebels. South Africaalso provided support until it signed a regional peace accord lastDecember that required a halt to the assistance.</TEXT></DOC>
