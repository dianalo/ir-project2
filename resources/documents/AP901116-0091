Frantic pupils from a nearby school had to be restrained fromgoing to the site.   Bob Stier, transportation supervisor for the Alexandria publicschools, said those killed were the bus driver and a student, oneof about 25 on the bus.   ``It is just horrendous,'' said Sheila Olson, principal at theMiltona Science Magnet School, where the bus had just dropped offpassengers before heading for the high school in Alexandria, 10miles to the south. ``I still can't believe it happened. It's justnot real.''   Seven of the injured were in stable condition at Douglas CountyHospital in Alexandria with fractures and internal injuries, saidBill Flaig, hospital administrator. ``It looks like they're goingto be here for a while,'' he said.   Fourteen people were treated and released after the 7:30 a.m.accident, Flaig said.   Ms. Olson said the accident scene was visible from the schooland teachers had to restrain some children from going to the site.Some of them were ``very upset'' because they had just gotten offthe bus and some had older brothers and sisters still aboard, shesaid.   ``The kids, many were crying, wanting their parents, and youjust feel so helpless,'' she said. ``You just don't know what todo.''   The cause was not immediately known, a sheriff's dispatchersaid.   ``The front end of the bus got hit,'' Stier said. ``It was aflat-nosed bus and (the train) hit the side where the driver was.''   ``The bus got spun around, then the front end of the bus hit alight pole,'' Stier said, adding that the train did not derail.   John Bergene, spokesman for the Minneapolis-based Soo LineRailroad, said there were no injuries on the train.   The maximum speed at the County Road 14 crossing is 40 mph,Bergene said, but the train's speed when the collision occurred wasnot yet known. There are yellow warning signs and stop signs at thecrossing, but no flashing signals, he said.   Stier said the bus driver was in his 60s and had been drivingschool buses for about 10 years. The bus was owned by the schooldistrict, he said.   Ms. Olson said the district has brought in a team of counselorsto help comfort the children.   The Rev. Nancy Larson, a Lutheran minister from Carlos, wasamong those trying to help. ``I just simply stood in the halls asstudents were walking back and forth between their rooms and justshared hugs with some of the children who were in tears and veryfrightened by it,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
