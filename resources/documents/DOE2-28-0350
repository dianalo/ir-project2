Enzyme activity measurements indicate high expression levelsof both plasmid-encoded Zymomonas proteins in the recombinant E. coli.The expression in E. coli is under the control of a promoter in the Zymomonassequence upstream of the pyruvate decarboxylase gene. The maximum ethanollevel, using 4% glucose as substrate, was 1.8% (w/v) in anaerobic conditions.In aerobic conditions the natural repression of E. coli alcohol dehydrogenaseresults in less ethanol production from clones expressing only Zymomonaspyruvate decarboxylase.</TEXT></DOC>
