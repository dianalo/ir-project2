Itmay also help restore public confidence, which has been shaken by the failureof Executive Life and several other large life insurers this year.;   Althoughdetails of the offer were sketchy, the organization said that it would befinanced by $1 billion in premiums assessed to companies that are members ofstate guarantee funds. A new company would be formed to assume ExecutiveLife's policies and its junk bond portfolio.;   Sarfaty said the plan &quot;offersironclad security,&quot; and that &quot;all Executive Life policyholders across thecountry would be guaranteed benefits significantly better&quot; than promised inAugust by Mutuelle Assurance Artisanale de France and Altus Finance.;   TheFrench plan also paid most policyholders death benefits and annuity paymentsbut only promised 81 percent of account value. Last month, the insurance grouphad agreed to enlist its members to make up the 19 percent shortfall topolicyholders under the French plan.;   The industry bid took regulators andother potential buyers by surprise. Normally, state-operated guaranty fundshelp cover policyholder losses when an insurer fails, and the group helpsco-ordinate efforts between guaranty funds when more than one state isinvolved.;   The guaranty funds from key states with large numbers ofExecutive Life policyholders, including California, Illinois, Pennsylvania andTexas, were the major players in developing the plan announced Thursday.;  Insurance officials said they believe it would cost their industry less moneyto buy and run Executive Life and rescue policyholders than to join a planorganized by a French consortium led by MAAF, the Paris-based mutual insurancefirm.;   &quot;We see this as a positive step,&quot; said Gene Grabowski, a spokesmanfor the American Council of Life Insurance. &quot;Competitive bids can only enhancethe value to policyholders and companies that are involved.&quot;;   Both theFrench plan and the industry proposal would offer 100 percent of recovery toindividuals with policies and annuities valued at $100,000 or less.;   Thereare substantial penalties under the MAAF-Altus plan for early withdrawal ofsome of the cash value of an insurance policy or an annuity contract. Sarfatysaid the penalties would be cut in half under the industry plan.;   The annualfees charged to policyholders, $50 to $75 under the French bid, would be 50percent less under the industry plan.;   Sarfaty said the French group isvaluing the junk bond portfolio of Executive Life at $2.7 billion and wouldneed to earn 20 percent before it could provide any additional money topolicyholders.;   The industry believes the portfolio is worth $3 billion andwould need to earn just 9 percent a year to offer additional recovery funds,he said.;   The government agencies that bought so-called guaranteedinvestment contracts also might share in the surplus. The contracts are notcovered by state insurance protection funds.;   &quot;This is a better arrangementfor all concerned,&quot; Sarfaty said.;   Altus and MAAF disagreed. Under theirproposal, Executive Life would be capitalized by selling its junk bondportfolio to Altus for $2.7 billion and infusing $300 million from MAAF, whichwould operate the new company.;   &quot;Any agreement that allows the junk bondportfolio to remain the dominant component of the insurance company's assetbase postpones dealing with the core problem,&quot; the French bidders said in astatement.;   Insurance regulators expect to receive several offers before acourt-imposed deadline of Oct. 11.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910920  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  17D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  669  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, September 20, 199100264070,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
