Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government, trying to reducethe 8 percent annual inflation rate, faces labor unrest from localgovernment employees, longshoremen, bus mechanics, ambulance crewsand others seeking seeking higher pay and other concessions.   Two royal parks, Hyde Park and Regent's Park, were turned intoemergency parking lots for commuters suffering through the fifthone-day railway and subway strike in five weeks. Trains and subwayscarry nearly 5 million daily.   Peak traffic periods started at 5:30 a.m. and midafternoon,causing huge traffic jams on some routes.   Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, president of the United ArabEmirates, began a four-day state visit without the splendor of thecustomary royal carriage procession to Buckingham Palace. The queencalled off the glittering procession because it would have closedsome of London's busiest roads.   The sheik traveled from Heathrow Airport in a fleet oflimousines, battling heavy traffic, but arrived at the palace ontime.   On Monday night, the 75,000-member National Union of Railwaymenrejected a revised 8.8 percent raise offer from state-owned BritishRail. The 17,500-member Associated Society of Locomotive Engineersand Firemen had accepted the offer, which was increased from 7percent, earlier in the day.   In the House of Commons, Mrs. Thatcher castigated the socialistLabor Party for not criticizing the striking rail workers. Theopposition party ``would rather inconvenience the consumer andtraveling public,'' she declared.   Michael Meacher, the Labor spokesman on employment, saidgovernment threats to ban strikes against essential public servicesthreatened ``fundamental democratic rights.''   Rail workers are among Britain's lowest-paid industrialemployees. Average earnings, including overtime, are $471 a week fordrivers and $325 for others.   The 10,500 striking London subway workers want a weekly raise of$102 to operate subway trains without conductors. Management hasoffered $48 plus extra vacation.   Ports management said Tuesday a strike of 9,400 longshormen thatbegan at 60 ports July 10 was crumbling. Iain Dale, spokesman forthe National Association of Port Employers, said 23 of the portswere operating normally.   Dock workers are striking because the government abolished aguaranteed-work plan in force at the 60 ports since 1947. Britain'sother 102 ports are not affected by the strike.   More than 500,000 members of the National and Local GovernmentOfficers Association began a three-day strike Tuesday, haltingmunicipal services that range from care for children and the elderlyto local tax offices, museums and libraries.   Union leaders agreed Tuesday to informal talks tentatively setfor Thursday. The employees earn an average of $16,000 a year. Theywant a 12 percent pay raise and have been offered 7 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
