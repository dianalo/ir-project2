Nearly 200,000 operators, clerks, installers and other workersstayed off the job in 20 states and the District of Columbia.Strikes began the weekend of Aug. 5-6 at New York-based NYNEX,Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic and San Francisco-based PacificTelesis. On Sunday, workers at Chicago-based Ameritech joined them.   Workers at the other three so-called Baby Bell companies havereached tentative settlements with the two big telephone unions, theCommunications Workers of America and the International Brotherhoodof Electrical Workers.   They are Atlanta-based BellSouth, which settled Aug. 5, andDenver-based US West and St. Louis based Southwestern Bell, whichboth reached settlements Sunday.   Officials at the four struck companies said customers wereexperiencing some delays in directory assistance, operator-assistedcalls and repair services, but management employees were beingtrained to take up part of the slack.   ``Four thousand people can't do the job of 12,800, but they'redoing the best they can,'' said Eileen Dixon, a spokeswoman forMichigan Bell, an Ameritech subsidiary.   Libraries have reported a high demand from people wantingtelephone numbers but unable to reach a directory assistanceoperator.   ``One day last week I had the Manhattan white pages and thePhiladelphia white pages out and didn't bother reshelfing thembetween calls,'' Terry Tilden of the State Library in Harrisburg,Pa., said Monday.   Representatives of Bell Atlantic and striking workers met forabout an hour Monday afternoon, and the company presented a revisedproposal, said Kenneth Pitt, a company spokesman. The company wasawaiting a union response, he said.   ``We've been making progress, obviously,'' Pitt said. ``We'd likeour people back and every day we hope it's the last day of thestrike.''   But CWA spokesman Jim Willer said the company's health-insuranceproposal was ``unacceptable.'' According to Willer, the companycontinued to demand that workers pay deductibles in addition to halfthe premiums for relatives other than spouses and children. Theunion refuses to pay any deductibles or premiums.   Willer said the company agreed to give an advisory committee onhealth benefits more power, but said, ``This obvious superficialattempt to settle the contract is yet another in a long list ofinsults.''   The issue of who pays for health insurance has been a key issuein several of the negotiations, as management has tried to shiftsome of the costs onto the workers.   A spokesman for Pacific Bell, a subsidiary of Pacific Telesis,said talks were planned later in the day. But no talks werescheduled at NYNEX or at the strikebound subsidiaries of Ameritech.   In the East, there were several incidents of trouble linked orpossibly linked to the strike:   _ A NYNEX picket, Edward G. Horgan, 34, was hospitalized incritical condition after he fell off a car that had brushed him on apicket line in the New York suburb of Mount Pleasant, police said.   Police Chief Paul Oliva said that an 18-year-old NYNEX employeewas driving on the service road of a NYNEX facility when her carbrushed Horgan, after he and several other pickets gathered aroundher car and yelled at her.   Horgan mounted the hood of the slowly moving car and pounded onthe windshield, but slid off and hit his head on the pavement,according to the police account. The union disputed that, saying hefell onto the hood when the young woman accelerated. No charges werefiled.   New York Telephone Co. President Fred Salerno appealed for calmafter the accident and said he had asked the union to resumenegotiations ``to try and calm the waters.''   _ In Elmont, N.Y., police said a NYNEX car was burned shortlyafter midnight in a company parking lot. The fire, which policedescribed as suspicious, also caused minor damage to a buildingnearby.   _ Most of West Virginia was without long distance service forabout eight hours beginning late Sunday when an aerial cable wasdamaged. Chesapeake andamp; Potomac Telephone spokeswoman Roberta Fowlkessaid vandalism couldn't be ruled out as the cause of the outage,which affected 600,000 customers. Lines also were damaged in theSissonville area, affecting local service.   Scattered incidents of strike-related vandalism were reportedlast week, including several incidents of damaged lines in NewJersey. Peter Ventimiglia, a spokesman for New Jersey Bell, saidMonday that the company had counted more than 175 incidents ofvandalism or sabotage last week, but no new incidents had beenreported Sunday night or Monday morning.   The ``Baby Bell'' companies were formed in 1984 by thecourt-ordered breakup of the American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. ATandamp;Treached union contracts earlier this year and was not directlyaffected by the strike.   The Ameritech walkout affected 35,000 CWA members and 12.3million customers in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan andWisconsin. Ameritech subsidiaries also employ 13,500 IBEW members,most of them in Illinois. That union advised members to follow theirown consciences when deciding whether to work or honor CWA picketlines; it appeared Monday that most were going to work.   Pacific Telesis has 42,000 CWA members and 2,500 IBEW members onstrike. It sewrves northern Nevada and all of California.   Bell Atlantic has 41,000 CWA workers and 11,500 IBEW members andprovides service in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.   NYNEX has 40,000 CWA workers and 20,000 IBEW members and providesservice in all or part of New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Connecticut.</TEXT></DOC>
