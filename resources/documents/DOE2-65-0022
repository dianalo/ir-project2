The urethane-acrylamideprepolymer was synthesized by the reaction of poly(butylene adipate)diol,diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and N-(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide. It wasfound from scanning electron microscopy that the urethane-acrylamidefilm, which was prepared by using a methyl ethyl ketone and dimethylformamide(3:1 v/v) mixture as casting solvent, had a microporous structure withpore size of several micrometers, and that the morphology was fixed byEB irradiation. The pore volume of the EB-cured microporous film wasdetermined to be about 460 mm/sup 3/ g/sup -1/ by mercury porosimetry.The micropores were not destroyed even after immersing in solvent, possiblybecause the cured film had high crystallinity and dense crosslinking.Moreover, it was found by X-ray photelectron spectroscopy that terminalportions of urethane-acrylamide were localized at the film surface.</TEXT></DOC>
