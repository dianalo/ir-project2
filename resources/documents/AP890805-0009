By 201-175, the House passed the $159 billion financial rescue _the biggest in the nation's history _ following a frantic 48 hoursof negotiations between Congress and the Bush administration.   The Senate approved the measure only two hours earlier, givingPresident Bush a victory on his first and biggest legislativeinitiative since taking office last January as Congress recessesfor a month. Bush had agreed in advance to the compromise, thesecond in as many days.   The bill provides $50 billion over the next three years to closeand merge 500 insolvent Sandamp;Ls and pay off savers whose billions ofdollars in government insured deposits were lost to failed andoften fraudulent loans, most of them in Texas.   It also totally overhauls the regulation of the industry to tryto fulfill Bush's promise that ``never again'' will taxpayers beasked to pay for losses. Sandamp;L owners will be required to putbillions of dollars more of their own money at risk as a bufferbetween risky loans and the federal deposit insurance funds.   The administration lobbied House Republicans throughout the dayto provide the winning margin as Democrats defected from the billin large numbers in response to a compromise hiding most of thecleanup costs off the budget and out of the official federaldeficit.   Republicans in the House supported the bill 119-40 whileDemocrats opposed it 135-82. Fifty-one members did not vote andfive voted ``present.''   Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., accused House members of losing theirconscience and their backbone in bowing to a veto threat from Bushand agreeing to financing the bulk of the bailout's costs through30-year bonds.   ``It should have been paid for by taxes, but the president couldnot bring himself to say the word,'' said Gibbons. ``So we havefostered this unconscionable debt on our children andgrandchildren.''   But with the losses of federally insured deposits mounting at arate of $20 million to $30 million a day, supporters said it wouldbe equally unconscionable for Congress to go on vacation withoutfixing the problem.   ``I for one don't want to take the chance of anotherbank-holiday crisis,'' said Rep. Chalmers Wylie, R-Ohio, referringto the wave of bank closings at the end of the Hooveradministration in early 1933 that deepened the Great Depression.   ``The alternative are unthinkable,'' added Rep. Steve Bartlett,R-Texas.   ``The savings of million of Americans are at stake unless we dosomething,'' Sen. Christopher Bond, D-Mo., said just before theunusual ``divison'' vote in which supporters and opponents indicatetheir position by standing.   The procedure leaves no record of who votes yes or no. But foursenators stood in opposition and three others asked to be recordedas opponents. They were Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla.; Kent Conrad,D-N.D.; Charles Grassley, R-Iowa; James Exon, D-Neb.; Wendell Ford,D-Ky.; John Warner, R-Va., and Jay Rockefeller, R-W.Va.   ``I think it is the best bill possible to craft under thecircumstances,'' said Sen. Donald Riegle Jr., chairman of theSenate Banking Committee. ``It will make major reforms in everyarea.''   President Bush was on the phone with House members from bothparties throughout the day, according to sources, pleading forsupport. And Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was dispatched tothe Capitol Hill to negotiate a resolve to the impasse.   Brady, a former appointed Republican senator from New Jersey,spent nearly an hour on the Senate floor lobbying former colleagues.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell took the bill the Senatefloor only after Brady and Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman ofthe House Energy and Commerce Committee, reached an accord onoff-budget bonds.   Dingell had demanded that the off-budget bonds to be used formuch of the financing be registered with the Securities andExchange Commission as carrying a risk higher than normalgovernment securities. He and Brady agreed that the SEC may demandfull disclosure to investors of risks but the bill does not requireregistration.   Dingell earlier Friday joined with three other committeechairmen to oppose the Thursday accord _ Reps. Dan Rostenkowski,D-Ill., Leon Panetta, D-Calif. and John Conyers, D-Mich.. Dingellleads the Energy and Commerce Committee; Rostenskowski chairs Waysand Means; Panetta is in charge of Budget and Conyers headsGovernment Operations.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
