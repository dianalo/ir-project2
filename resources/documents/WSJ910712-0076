Jones andamp; Co., the brokerage firm with 1,628 smalloffices nationwide, recently took that approach to extremesin a slick, half-hour video broadcast internally to Jonesbrokers.</LP><TEXT>   The tape features Thomas Miltenberger, Jones's head ofmutual-fund marketing, decked out as Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf.For most of the tape, the &quot;general&quot; conducts a fictitious,Desert Storm-style news conference as he declares an &quot;all-outwar&quot; to sell more investments to clients.   Calling himself Stormin' Norman Schwartzenberger andwearing an authentic-looking camouflage uniform with gasmask, Mr. Miltenberger urges brokers to boost the brokeragefirm's sales by 25%. He calls it Operation Bonus Bracket.   There are &quot;untold amounts&quot; of money and &quot;caches ofsecurities&quot; in the hands of investors that Jones must&quot;attack,&quot; Mr. Miltenberger barks. The firm will be mountingan &quot;all-out push&quot; to sell six particular mutual funds thatprovide sizable fees for the brokers, he explains.   &quot;Our strategy is to go . . . with . . . what's . . . hot,&quot;he adds, whacking his pointer on the lectern to emphasizeeach word.   Some of the presentation is meant to amuse. But itsunderlying message is serious: Sell more stuff, and sell itfast. And that has caused a stir among some current andformer Jones brokers, who feel the war analogies send thewrong message about the firm's approach with investors.   The tape -- intended &quot;for internal use only&quot; -- is not thesort of thing Jones wants the public to see. Jones officialsin Maryland Heights, Mo., said yesterday that they are sorrythey ever made it. &quot;We tried to have a little fun and quitehonestly now wish we had never done it,&quot; said Douglas Hill,Jones's sales-and-marketing head and Mr. Miltenberger's boss.&quot;That tape in no way was meant to be seen by any of ourcustomers.&quot;   The video provides a rare peek into how securities firmssometimes pump up their brokers to push investments. It showsthat even a conservatively run firm like Jones, which servesmany small towns with single-broker offices and a down-homeapproach, pulls out the stops to motivate brokers to get outthere and sell.   On the tape, broadcast over Jones's satellite system toits 1,687 brokers, Mr. Miltenberger complains about the majorobstacle to the war effort: Scuds, or Some CrummyUnenthusiastic Dudes. These are people who aren't excitedabout what Jones is doing. There are both broker and customerScuds, he explains.   A customer Scud, says Mr. Miltenberger, &quot;is the clientthat says, `I don't have any money available,' `Interestrates are going up,' `The market's going down,' `Uh, call meback later.' `I have to check with my commander.'&quot;   &quot;If you should encounter a C-Scud on your telephone,&quot;advises Mr. Miltenberger, &quot;tell them that you will call themback after the operation and get on to more productivefolks.&quot;   Jones's Mr. Hill said he can see how the Scud analogycould be &quot;taken wrong.&quot; But he stresses: &quot;We do have a lot ofrespect for our customers.&quot; He added that Jones's currentcampaign is to get its brokers to sit down with their clientsand conduct annual reviews of their portfolios.   Jones has made such satiric broker tapes in the past --such as a series of Bartles andamp; Jaymes wine cooler spoofs andan astronaut segment featuring two of the firm's officials ina moon buggy. Jones said the war video was the third attemptat a funny presentation out of the 84 satellite videos it hasmade this year.   &quot;It's done to fire up the troops, so to speak,&quot; saidEdward Hupp, a former top-producing Jones broker. &quot;They'rereally into the video thing.&quot;   The war tape was made in April, when Jones, like otherbrokerage firms, was seeking to capture some of the billionsof dollars investors had parked in certificates of depositthat would soon mature.   The videotape also provides some insights into the feesthat brokers can get when they sell investments. The bondsand mutual funds described on the tape are sold with healthyadded fees called &quot;points&quot; -- each representing 1% of theproducts' value. For example, when a customer buys a $10,000bond &quot;with four points,&quot; the broker receives $400 incommissions.   A Cincinnati Gas andamp; Electric Co. bond, announces Mr.Miltenberger at one point, comes &quot;with four, with fourpoints. Gentlemen, write that down. Four points]&quot;   In an update on the &quot;war&quot; broadcast to Jones brokers twodays later, Mr. Miltenberger says that only six hours intothe campaign, there were already more than 100 &quot;direct hits,&quot;sales to customers of the six mutual funds. He also says thatthe firm had one of its biggest days ever selling annuities.   But he complains that one particular issue isn't sellingas hoped, &quot;and our suggestion is that our troops should callall of the C-Scuds, the client Scuds who are out there usingdelaying tactics, and tell them they must make a decision onthis objective soon]&quot;   Mr. Miltenberger couldn't be reached for comment on hisperformance as the general. But he has a &quot;lot of charismawith the sales force,&quot; said his boss, Mr. Hill, who addedthat &quot;some of the adjectives and words he used he probablyshouldn't have.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
