The DTC, DataTransporter Computer, has three dimensional single instruction multiple dataarchitecture with two and three dimensional unfolding capability.andP;  DTC Model4 has 4,096 processors, while Models 8 and 16 have 8,192 and 16,384respectively.andP;  The processors are implemented on CMOS gate arrays fromToshiba Corp. Each processor has 256 bytes of local high-speed static memory,adding up to a total of 1Mb on the Model 4, 2Mb on the 8, 4Mb on the 16.andO;There is also extended memory storage of 8Kb or 32Kb per processor, whichadds up to 512Kb in the largest configuration.andP;  The Model 4 has a256Mbyte-per-second data input output capacity, Model 8 has a throughput of512Mbytes-per-second and model 16 provides 1,024Mbytes-per-second.andP;  The DTCinterfaces with any SCSI system, and uses 16MHz front-end processors with 8Mbdata memory.andP;  It uses the host's Unix system, and appears as a window in theworkstation environment.andP;  The company has also introduced several softwaretools for the new system, including the multi-C programming language.andP;  Thisis an extension to ANSI C that supports bit-length arithmetic and provides asyntax for manipulating variables.andP;  It executes data-parallel expressions andan extended set of data types allows large arrays of data to be manipulatedas a single unit.andP;  The language is host independent since a translatorproduces host C code that varies with the host computer, and both computersmay be controlled through a single program.andP;  The Data Transporter Computer is#80,000 to #360,000, the C compiler is #25,000.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
