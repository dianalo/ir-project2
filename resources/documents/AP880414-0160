Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the subcommittee on foreignoperations, told State and Defense Department witnesses he was``fed up with getting this mush from you. You must really thinkwe're saps up here.''   He then suspended the hearing after only 50 minutes and strodeout of the room.   ``There was no sense in my sitting listening for the informationonly to be told they they didn't have it,'' Obey told the AP later.``That was the same thing they said before.''   At the root of the dispute are demands by Congress that otherNATO members spend more money on the defense of the alliance, inwhat is known as ``burden sharing.''   Obey's outburst was prompted by the administration's failure toprovide the committee with detailed lists of the surplus militaryequipment being transferred to Greece, Turkey and Portugal thisyear.   Obey said he had asked for the lists several months ago to helpthe committee decide how to allocate funds for the administration's1989 spending request of $1.4 billion for the three countries,where the United States maintains military bases and some 15,000personnel.   The three are the poorest members of NATO, and theadministration contends the United States must fund them in orderto ensure continued basing rights.   Obey, a vocal foe of U.S. spending on NATO allies, said theUnited States should not ``be engaged in unilateral welfareefforts'' for these countries. Rather, he said, the aid should be ajoint NATO effort.   ``My view is that there should be zero funding this year forbase rights countries,'' he said.   Obey claimed that taxpayers in Athens, Wis., are paying more forthe defense of Greece than those in Athens, Greece. ``My taxpayersare fed up with this, and so am I.''   The U.S. taxpayer spends more than $1,000 a year on the defenseof the free world, while British taxpayers spend per capita $488,the French $511, the West Germans $433 and the Japanese $163, Obeysaid. ``We're being taken for a ride.''   Obey railed against such NATO members as West Germany ``whoconstantly lecture us on our deficit and on managing our economy''but fail to share the burden of maintaining the U.S. presence inEurope.   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charles Thomas, defendingthe administration's spending request _ which is 41 percent higherthan the base rights funding of 1981 _ said U.S. interests clearlylie in a continued U.S. presence in Europe. ``Our border beginsthere,'' he said.   Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense John A. Woodworth said inhis testimony that while U.S. defense spending grew much more thanthat of other NATO members in the years between 1981 and 1986,``that pattern is now reversed.''   He said several NATO countries, among them Italy, Greece,Norway, Spain and Turkey, increased their defense spending by about3 percent in 1987, while the U.S. increase was only 0.1 percent andin 1988 it will decline more than 3 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
