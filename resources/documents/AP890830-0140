Federal officials said Wednesday there's nothing illegal aboutit. But Gov. Michael Dukakis says it's got to stop because it goesagainst his new efforts to crack down on aid to illegal aliens,which he says the state can no longer afford.   The practice started after Dukakis issued a 1985 executive orderbarring state agencies from asking people applying for stateservices about their citizenship status.   But citizens or not, the computerized welfare records required acase identification number for each person, and that had to be anine-digit number since for most people the ID is the same as theirSocial Security number.   Dukakis' legal counsel, Don Stern, said the law setting up thegeneral relief program, a totally state-financed welfare program forpeople who don't qualify for federal welfare, left it up to theWelfare Department if applicants didn't have a Social Securitynumber.   Welfare spokeswoman Michal Regunberg said the department issuedits own control numbers.   Welfare Department attorney Thomas Noonan said the dummy numbersstarted with a three-digit prefix not used by the Social SecurityAdministration.   Regunberg said those control numbers would have been rejected bySocial Security Administration computers, so they could not havebeen used to obtain federally subsidized welfare or by an illegalalien seeking a job.   John Connolly, a spokesman for the Social Security Administrationin Boston, said there is nothing illegal under federal law withusing ID numbers with the same number of digits as Social Securitynumbers.   ``As far as we are concerned, there is nothing illegal,''Connolly said.   Welfare Commissioner Carmen Camino-Siegrist said illegal aliensmade up 400 to 500 of the 28,500 people in Massachusetts gettingGeneral Relief.   Both she and Human Services Secretary Philip W. Johnston saidsome recipients without Social Security numbers were U.S. citizenswho were mentally ill or severely mentally retarded and had neverobtained a Social Security card.   Dukakis said Wednesday he had not known dummy numbers were issuedto illegals applying for general relief.   ``But I think in fairness to the people at the WelfareDepartment, they were trying to help some folks who basically camein off the street, were in dire need and had no other means ofsupport,'' Dukakis said in an interview with radio station WTAG inWorcester, where he was on an official trip.   Dukakis said that in many cases the people ``were politicalrefugees who faced death if they went back to their home countries.''   However, Dukakis announced recently he was changing state policyto remove illegal aliens from relief rolls, a move officialsestimated would save about $1 million a year.   ``Because of the fiscal situation, we just can't continue to dothis and we won't. We've got to stop it,'' Dukakis said.   Muriel Heiberger, director of the Massachusetts Immigrant andRefugee Coalition, said she may challenge the change of policy incourt.   ``This move on the part of the governor represents a tragicretreat from the commonwealth's previous commitment to help peoplewho fled their countries because of persecution, violence oreconomic necessity,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
