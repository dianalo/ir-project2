The resignation set the stage for new general elections nextmonth.   Tzannetakis headed the coalition government that emerged fromthe June 18 general elections.   His New Democracy Party and the communist-dominated Coalition ofthe Left and Progress agreed to unite only to push Premier AndreasPapandreou's eight-year socialist administration out of power andlaunch an investigation of government corruption.   Tzannetakis met with President Christos Sartzetakis at thepresidential palace where he told him that his government hadcompleted its mission of instigating a cleanup of Greek politics.   A member of the premier's New Democracy Party said Tzannetakiswas asked by the president to remain until a new administration wasformed.   But chances for a new government to be formed from the presentParliament appeared extremely slim.   New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis and Greek CommunistParty chief Harilaos Florakis stated they would reject apresidential mandate to form a new Cabinet.   However, Papandreou has said he would make an attempt to form acaretaker government.   Presumably Papandreou will attempt to persuade the communists tojoin him in an alliance supported by socialist and leftist forces.   Papandreou, 70, has been indicted by Parliament twice within thepast three weeks for allegedly instigating illegal wiretapping ofpolitical friends and foes and for his alleged involvement in amillion dollar banking embezzlement scheme.   Two special courts of Supreme Court judges are expected toconvene within the next two months to start proceedings againstPapandreou and former socialist ministers and officials allegedlyconnected with the scandals.   Papandreou and his ex-ministers have denied any wrongdoingduring their term in office.</TEXT></DOC>
