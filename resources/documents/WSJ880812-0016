The offer initially was scheduled to expire today.    A spokesman for San Diego Gas said the request was made so its directors could study and consider SCEcorp's offer. It's understood that San Diego Gas has been seeking additional information from SCEcorp about its offer.    SCEcorp, the Rosemead, Calif-based parent of Southern California Edison Co., made the unsolicited offer late last month. The bid is considered the boldest step in what analysts say may be a growing trend toward utility mergers. The combination would create the nation's biggest investor-owned utility with more than $17 billion in assets.    The bid has threatened to stymie a June merger pact between San Diego Gas and Tucson Electric Power Co. SCEcorp has said its offer to exchange 1.15 of SCEcorp common stock for each of San Diego Gas common share is contingent on the termination of that agreement.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, San Diego Gas closed yesterday at $34.25 a share, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
