Each company is &quot;weak in the other company's technology,&quot; she said. &quot;It's a natural.&quot;    The accord is the latest in a series of steps by Toshiba to bolster its electronics division. With fierce competition at home from rivals it can't seem to overtake, Toshiba has chosen a strategy of teaming up with strong foreign makers.    The Toshiba-Motorola link also is the latest move by Japanese chip makers looking for ways to strengthen their position overseas and circumvent trade friction. But while others are building chip plants or acquiring foreign companies, Toshiba is setting up partnerships.    Like other Japanese makers, Toshiba is competitive in the mass-market memory chips that are America's weakness. But the company is weak in the logic-chip market that U.S. companies dominate.    Toshiba is intent on making a name for itself in semiconductors. Established in 1875 to make telegraph equipment, it became a leading vendor of heavy electrical equipment after World War II. But demand for heavy equipment went flat when oil prices surged in the 1970s.    Since the early 1980s, the company has been shifting to microelectronics and information processing. To vie with such archrivals as NEC Corp. in computers and communications, Toshiba needs strong chip-making capabilities.    In the 1970s, Toshiba focused on integrated circuits for consumer goods, neglecting the industrial chips used in computers. By the time the company began making those chips, NEC and Hitachi Ltd. were so far ahead in memory chips that Toshiba considered dropping the line.    But under Shoichi Saba, who was president at the time and now is chairman, Toshiba has made heavier capital investments in the past four years than any Japanese chip maker, aiming to leapfrog into the front lines. It also began crash development of semiconductors.    The efforts are beginning to pay off. Industrial electronics and electronic parts made up 33% of Toshiba's $6.96 billion in sales last year, converting the yen at its current rate, up from 26% in 1980. And the company was the first to market the latest generation of memory chips, one-megabit devices which each store about a million bits of digital information.    Toshiba's range of chip products still leans toward consumer chips. The company's chip sales rank third in Japan, after Hitachi and NEC, and fifth world-wide. Indeed, Toshiba dominates few product areas. Although it is the leading seller of Japanese word processors and No. 1 in several markets for components, it isn't tops in any major market segment.    Toshiba needs mainframe and telecommunications technology and more capability in industrial semiconductors, said Ryoji Musha, an analyst at Daiwa Securities Research Institute. &quot;If they don't correct these points, they won't reach their goal&quot; of rivaling Hitachi and NEC, he said.    That's where Motorola and other foreign companies come in. To build its information-processing capability, Toshiba last year bought into the Japanese subsidiary of Italian computer maker Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co. It also has agreements with American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., including marketing the U.S. concern's telecommunications equipment. But most important are the semiconductor tie-ups that Toshiba sees as the key to success in electronics.    In 1985 the company agreed with LSI Logic Corp. of the U.S. to develop and sell chips called gate arrays. In August, Toshiba agreed with General Electric Co. of the U.S. and Siemens AG of West Germany to jointly develop &quot;cell libraries.&quot; Each company will engineer cells, circuit patterns etched onto a chip, and add them to the library.    That move was preceded by a 1985 agreement to transfer to Siemens technology for producing one-megabit memory chips. Last year Toshiba also agreed to send a leading engineer to Hewlett-Packard Co. to manage the U.S. company's semiconductor division for three years.    The Motorola agreement is Toshiba's biggest. Motorola, which wants to get back into memory chips after being trounced by Japanese makers, gets production technology for Toshiba's one-megabit dynamic random access memory chips and four-megabit chips when they are developed.    Toshiba gets Motorola's logic chips, which process information. The plums are Motorola's eight-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors.    Motorola commands 57% of the market for the 32-bit chip, according to Dataquest Inc., a U.S. market-research company. Hitachi, Motorola's partner in the past for the product, makes the U.S. company's eight-bit and 16-bit chips under license. Hitachi wants rights to the 32-bit chip as well, but Motorola hasn't agreed.    The Toshiba-Motorola agreement also calls for each company to sell the other's chips. And it provides for technology exchange, joint development of new chips and establishment of a $215 million joint venture in Izumi city, 210 miles from Tokyo. The equally owned concern is scheduled to begin turning out leading-edge memory chips and microprocessors early in 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
