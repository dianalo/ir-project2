MSI's board will state its position on the offer on or before Sept. 23, Charles S. Strauch, president and chief executive officer of MSI, said yesterday in a letter to shareholders. Telxon's offer expires at 12:01 a.m. EDT, Oct. 8.    &quot;The board believes that it is not in your best interest to make a decision whether to accept or reject the offer until the MSI board, with the help of its financial and legal advisers, has completed its review and advised you of its position,&quot; Mr. Strauch said in the letter.    MSI's stock was up 12.5 cents a share to close at $17.50 in American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Telxon shares closed in national over-the-counter trading at $17.25, unchanged.    Telxon filed suit yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Del., seeking to overturn that state's anti-takeover law in order to ease its takeover of MSI. MSI is incorporated in Delaware.    Akron, Ohio-based Telxon is MSI's chief competitor in the hand-held computer business. The two companies have been bitter rivals for years and have lawsuits pending against one another. According to Telxon's tender-offer materials, officials of the two companies conferred twice -- once in February 1986 and again last December -- to see whether they could settle those suits.    Telxon further said in the offering materials that it will require about $113.2 million to purchase all MSI shares and to pay costs and expenses related to the offer. It said it intends to raise $40 million of that from currently available working capital and to obtain the rest through borrowings from National City Bank, a unit of Cleveland-based National City Corp. Telxon said National City Bank last Tuesday agreed to lend it as much as $100 million under a line of credit.    Telxon said it owns only about 5,100 MSI shares, or less than 0.1% of the shares outstanding.    Raymond D. Meyo, Telxon's president and chief executive officer, met with MSI's Mr. Strauch last Thursday, Telxon said in the offering materials. At that meeting, Mr. Meyo explained &quot;that he believed that the integration&quot; of the two companies &quot;would create new opportunities not currently available to either.&quot;    Mr. Meyo proposed the $17-a-share price and said Telxon was prepared to increase that price if MSI &quot;could demonstrate greater value,&quot; the tender offer adds. Mr. Strauch, it said, &quot;refused to enter into any negotiations or further discussions regarding a combination.&quot;    Telxon said it preferred to enter a negotiated transaction, which, it said, would give greater value to its stockholders. </TEXT></DOC>
