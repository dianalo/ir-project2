The 44-page report harshly criticized both management and laborat Guilford Transportation Industries, where workers went on strikeNov. 12, 1987, following an accident at a Lawrence, Mass., freightyard that killed a conductor. Strikers returned to work this summerafter a federal arbitration board ruled in their favor.   ``Both management and those opposing management's position havedemonstrated their willingness to compromise both work place andpublic safety when their economic interests are at stake,'' the FRAreport said.   Labor and management were willing ``to use the safety issue asleverage to achieve (their) objectives.''   The agency disagreed with the union's contentions that therewere safety problems before the strike. But the report saidengineers hired to replace striking workers were recruited ``fromany available source ... in disregard of sound safety practice andsimple common sense.''   ``The result was an engineer force that resembled a patchworkquilt, with engineers ranging from qualified to plainlyunqualified. The company was willing to compromise public safety toachieve its economic objective.''   The union, meanwhile, ``waged what amounted to a campaign ofintimidation against the carrier and its replacement employees,''the report said.   The FRA cited more than 100 incidents of slashed air brake hosesplus derailments caused by objects placed on Guilford tracks. Beartraps were once set where replacement employees were expected towalk the next shift.   ``Whatever their economic differences may be, it is essentialthat both sides keep safety separate from their ongoing economicdisputes and make a common commitment to observe sound safetypractices even when they are in conflict with the partiesshort-term economic objectives,'' the FRA said.   Michael Maloof, chairman of the United Transportation Union,said he had not seen the FRA report, but denounced it and calledFRA Administrator John Reilly ``anti-union.''   Guilford Vice President Colin Pease also lambasted the report,saying it ``politicizes the process.''   ``At no time did this railroad put employees to work who wereunqualified. When the strike began, we dramatically curtailed ourservice because we did not have sufficient employees,'' Pease said.``There is no issue more important to the management of thisrailroad than safety.''   The FRA concluded that working conditions were safe when theunion went on strike last year in connection with safety issues.That conclusion differs sharply from a federal arbitration boardruling in June that said the strike was legitimate because ofunsafe rail conditions.   The company was ordered to reinstate the workers and paymillions in back pay. Guilford officials are appealing thatdecision, but have rehired the workers.   In February, the FRA announced $734,900 in fines againstGuilford for a variety of safety violations.</TEXT></DOC>
