The estimated 5,000 refugees jammed in the embassy building andin 30 tents hurriedly thrown up on its elegant grounds shouted injoy and flashed V-for-victory with their fingers as they got thefirst word on West German radio.   They burst into cheers again when West German diplomats laterannounced the East Germans could leave legally by any means theyliked, by simply showing their East German identity documents.   The first private cars and two West German tour buses with about100 refugees on board headed toward the West German border atmidnight Friday, about an hour after the announcement.   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, toldreporters no time limit was set on the exodus. It was not clear ifthis meant the effective removal of barriers on travel to WestGermany for East Germans, who may visit Czechoslovakia withoutpermission from their government.   West German officials said many of those in the embassy woulddepart on special trains from Prague's Liben station Saturdaymorning.   West Germany said the agreement was reached with East Germany,permitting the third such exodus from the West German mission inPrague in six weeks.   Scores of East Germans arriving fresh from their homes turned upat the embassy astonished and happy to discover they could alreadyleave.   More than 12,000 East Germans had swarmed across the border intoCzechoslovakia in the three days since their government lifted amonth-old ban on travel to the country, the only land East Germansmay visit without prior permission.   More than 2,000 East Germans flooded into the Prague mission onFriday alone, many voicing bitter disappointment with promises ofreform from a new Communist leader at home.   Harried diplomats tried to process the refugees. Tents wereerected and staircases filled with people to try to accommodate theinflux.   The overcrowding apparently forced the latest East Germanagreement to an exodus. Last month, two waves of East Germanemigres left last month on special trains from Prague through EastGermany to West Germany.   The arrangement announced Friday apparently allows the EastGermans to go West without waiting for the cumbersome bureaucraticprocedure of renouncing their East German citizenship through theEast German Embassy in Prague.   This would avoid clashes that ensued in October when thousandsof East Germans tried to board the rail cars going west as theypassed through their Communist nation.   East Germany's new leader Egon Krenz, who announced sweepingreforms and the resignation of five aging Politburo members in anational television address Friday night, apparently was anxious toavoid more clashes.   Krenz also appealed to his citizens to stay in their Communisthomeland, which has lost more than 70,000 citizens fleeing througheastern Europe since August. Another 101,000 East Germans haveemigrated legally to West Germany this year.   Krenz's predecessor, Erich Honecker, had banned travel toCzechoslovakia to stop an earlier exodus of mostly young, skilledworkers from the Communist country.   Honecker's ouster and indications Krenz might be open to somereforms did not sway some of the refugees.   ``It's just the same hard-headed idiots as before,'' said abricklayer from Karl-Marx-Stadt. ``What's going to change? Thecorrupted socialism in our country is just getting new clothes,that's all.''   ``You've just got to use an open barn door to the West while youcan,'' said a 25-year-old from Leipzig.   Some blamed Krenz himself for their decision to leave, citinghis comments during a visit to Moscow this week that ii is ``notpossible'' to reunite East and West Germany.   ``When he buried any hope of reunification, I knew I've got toget out,'' said a young father from Dresden.</TEXT></DOC>
