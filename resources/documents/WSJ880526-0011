Chicago West, a closely held Cincinnati-based holding company, said it purchased 392,750 Vortec shares at $5 a share. Chicago West also said it amended its acquisition accord with Cincinnati-based Vortec to assure that other Vortec shareholders will receive $5 a share.    Vortec, a maker of compressed-air products, previously had said it might terminate the agreement if the price, as a result of certain factors, would be reduced below $4.50 a share.    Hinderliter, a Tulsa, Okla., metals maker and investment concern, had sought to acquire Vortec when Vortec agreed in April to be purchased by Chicago West Pullman for about $9.9 million. Vortec holders are expected to vote in early July to ratify the agreement.    Yesterday, Vortec shares closed at $4.50, up 12.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
