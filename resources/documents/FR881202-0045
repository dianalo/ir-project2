Stafford Elementary and SecondarySchool Improvement Amendments of 1988, Pub. L. 100-297. Section 3501 ofthat statute amends and restates Part E of the General Education ProvisionsAct (GEPA), which relates to the enforcement of legal requirements undermost grant programs administered by the Secretary of Education. The proposedregulations in this document contain standards and procedures relatingto the newly-authorized Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) andhearings for the recovery of funds conducted by the OALJ. These proposedregulations thus implement the core provisions of the amended statute.The Secretary intends to develop additional regulations to implement theremaining provisions of Part E, and those regulations will be publishedin proposed form at a later date. A discussion of specific provisions ofthe proposed regulations in this document follows.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart A_General Provisions</ITAG>Subpart A contains provisions relating to the establishment of the OALJ.Section 81.1 sets out the purpose of Part 81. Section 81.2 lists the definitionsof terms used in that part, including ``applicable program'' (<T3>i.e.,</T3> a program to which Part E of GEPA applies) and ``disallowancedecision'' (<T3>i.e.,</T3> an appealable decision of a Departmental official to requirea recipient to return funds). Section 81.3 sets out the statutory jurisdictionof the OALJ and provides that the Secretary publishes a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> if he designates an additional proceeding orclass of proceedings to be heard by that Office. Section 81.4 states whothe members of the OALJ are, provides for the appointment of one of themembers as the chief judge, and describes how members are assigned to cases.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart B_General Rules of Procedure</ITAG>Subpart B contains general procedural rules for any proceeding conductedby the OALJ. For a particular kind of Part E proceeding, the general rulesin Subpart B are supplemented by speicific rules for that kind of proceeding.One set of specific rules is Subpart D_Hearings for Recovery of Funds,which is a part of this document. Specific rules for other Part E proceedingswill be published in a separate document.Section 81.10 sets out the authority and responsibility of an AdministrativeLaw Judge (ALJ) in conducting a hearing on the record. This section includesprovisions on the disqualification of an ALJ from a case. The Secretaryintends that the disqualification provisions be interpreted in the lightof 28 U.S.C. 455, relating to the disqualification of a Federal judge.Section 81.11 describes a hearing on the record under Part 81. This sectioncontemplates that the hearing will generally be conducted on the basisof briefs and other written submissions, and it establishes standards forthe receipt of oral testimony and the hearing of oral argument. This sectionalso authorizes an ALJ to hold conferences of the parties in person orby conference telephone call.Section 81.12 contains provisions for the participation in cases beforean ALJ of persons or organizations other than the parties. Under theseprovisions, a third party files an application to participate with theALJ. The ALJ reviews the application and determines whether and to whatextent participation is warranted. This section contemplates that third-partyparticipation will generally be limited to the submission of briefs butpermits certain other forms of participation in the ALJ's discretion. Section 81.13 permits a party or other participant to be represented bycounsel. Section 81.14 requires generally that proceedings at which theparties must appear in person be held in the Washington, DC, area. Section81.15 prohibits a party or other participant from communicating with anALJ <T3>ex parte</T3> on any fact at issue in a case or any matter relevantto the merits. Section 81.16 provides that a party's request for an order or a rulingfrom an ALJ be made by motion and sets out the standards and proceduresfor motion practice. Section 81.17 governs the filing of briefs and otherwritten submissions. It requires service of the filed materials on theother party and sets standards for the identification of filing dates.Section 81.18 provides that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not applyto proceedings under Part 81 but that an ALJ accepts only evidence thatis relevant, material, not unduly repetitious, and not inadmissible becauseit relates to settlement and mediation discussions. This seciton also authorizesan ALJ to take official notice of certain facts. Section 81.19 acknowledgesthe applicability of legal privileges under common law as interpreted bythe Federal courts. Section 81.20 requires that any evidentiary hearingor oral argument be recorded and transcribed and that the transcript bemade available to the parties upon request at no charge. This section alsodescribes what the record consists of for purposes of further proceedings.Section 81.21 pertains to settlement negotiations. It requires an ALJ tostay the proceedingts for settlement negotiations or the approval of asettlement agreement if the parties so request. This section also requiresthe ALJ to dismiss the case if the parties enter into a settlement agreementand request dismissal. Finally, this section bars disclosing the contentsof settlement negotiations to the ALJ and admitting evidence of conductor statements made during settlement negotiations in any proceeding underPart 81. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart C_Other Rules </ITAG>Subpart C contains special new rules that apply to OALJ proceedings underthe amendments to Part E of GEPA. Section 81.30 governs the discovery process. It provides, as a generalpolicy, that the parties to a proceeding are encouraged to exchange relevantdocuments and information voluntarily. This policy is intended to reducethe high cost in time and money that formal discovery may entail and topromote the resolution of disputes through mediation and settlement. Inaddition, this discovery, provisions pertaining to the issuance and enforcementof subpoenas, and a limit on the period for discovery. This section alsoincludes an express prohibition against an ALJ's compelling discovery oflegally privileged information. See H.R. Rep. No. 95, 100th Cong., 1stSess., 93 (1987). Section 81.31 describes the voluntary mediation that is available in casespending before the OALJ. This section includes provisions concerning thequalifications of a mediator, a limit on the period for mediation, andcriteria for extending that period. To promote a free and open discussionduring mediation and to preserve the mediator's impartiality, this sectionbars the introduction of evidence from the mediation discussions in proceedingsunder Part 81 and prohibits the mediator from disclosing in these proceedingscertain information acquired as a part of his or her mediation duties.The Secretary specifically requests comments on how a successful mediationprocess for OALJ cases may be ensured. Section 81.32 recites the statutory requirement that the Equal Access toJustice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504, applies to OALJ proceedings. This section alsoincludes a reference to the Department's regulations implementing thatstatute. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart D_Hearings for Recovery of Funds </ITAG>Subpart D contains specific rules that apply to hearings for the recoveryof funds under applicable programs. The regulations in Subparts A throughC apply to these hearings as well. Section 81.40 sets out the basis for requiring a recipient to return fundsto the Department and recites the statutory provision that a decision todo so may be based on evidence in any form. Section 81.41 summarizes theconsiderations that determine the amount of funds required to be returned:proportionality of the remedy to the violation and the exclusion of anyamount attributable to mitigating circumstances or barred by the applicablestatute of limitations. Section 81.42 addresses the first of these considerations_proportionality.This section recites the statutory provision that the amount required tobe returned be proportional to the extent of harm caused by a violationof law to an identifiable Federal interest associated with the programin question. The regulations then set out an illustrative list of identifiableFederal interests and a second list of hypothetical examples of how thestandards for proportionality apply. The purpose of the examples is topromote predictable, consistent, and equitable results in the enforcementof grant conditions and thereby reduce the litigation associated with theenforcement process. Section 81.43 addresses the second consideration in setting the measureof recovery_mitigating circumstances. Under the amended statute, a Stateor local educational agency is not required to return misspent funds ifthe misexpenditures was caused by certain mitigating circumstances. Thissection sets out each of the three types of qualifying mitigating circumstancesand states what the recipient must prove to be relieved of the obligationto return funds. Section 81.44 describes the Department's notice of a disallowance decision.The notice must include a prima facie case for the recovery of funds andinform the recipient of its statutory rights to obtain review of the decisionby the OALJ and to request mediation. In addition, this section requiresthat the notice describe the time available to apply for review and theprocedure for filing an application for review.   Sections 81.45 and 81.46 describe the means by which the Department mayreduce the amount of a claim: redetermining the claim on the basis of aproper application of the law to the facts, compromising the claim undergovernment-wide standards, or compromising the claim under standards inthe amended Part E of GEPA. Section 81.46 recites the statutory standardsand procedures for compromising a claim under the GEPA provisions, whichpermit the Secretary to compromise up to $200,000 in the amount of a claim.  Section 81.47 states the statutory requirement that a recipient file anapplication for review with the OALJ within 30 days of receipt of the noticeof a disallowance decision. This section also sets out the required contentsof such an application. If an application is timely filed, the ALJ whoconsiders it may permit the recipient to supplement or amend the applicationwith respect to issues that were timely raised.   Section 81.48 describes the process by which an application for reviewis considered. First, the ALJ assign to the case reviews the Department'snotice of a disallowance decision for compliance with the requirementsin 81.44. If the notice meets these requirements, the ALJ proceeds to considerthe application for review; if not, the notice is returned to the Departmentalofficial who issued it for possible modification and reissuance. If theapplication for review, with any supplements or amendments, meets the requirementsof 81.47, the ALJ accepts jurisdiction of the case and schedules a hearingon the record; if not, the disallowance decision becomes the final decisionof the Department.   Section 81.49 implements the statutory requirements for timely adjudicationby requiring that all evidence in a case be submitted within 90 days ofthe OALJ's receipt of the application for review, subject to extensionfor good cause. Section 81.50 implements the statutory provisions relatingto the burden of proof. This section provides that the recipient presentsits case first and has the burden of proving that it is not required toreturn funds for one or more of the reasons recognized by law.   Section 81.51 requires that the ALJ make an initial decision based on therecord (described in 81.20), sets out the elements of such a decision,and describes the procedures for notifying the Secretary and the partiesto the case.   Sections 81.52 and 81.53 described the procedure for review of an ALJ'sinitial decision by the Secretary. Section 81.52 describes how review ofan initial decision may be obtained. Because of the limited time availableunder the statute for the Secretary's review, this section is framed topermit both parties to seek review simultaneously even if one party seeksno modification of the initial decision. As provided by the statute, aparty has 30 days from receipt of the initial decision to file its petitionfor review. This section requires that the petition be filed by hand-deliveredor overnight mail delivery and that a copy be simultaneously served onthe other party by these means. This section also sets out the requiredcontents of a petition and establishes a 15-day period for a party to filea responsive statement of its views on the issues raised in the other side'spetition.   Section 81.53 states which decisions are and are not subject to reviewand what materials the Secretary considers during the review process. Thissection recites the statutory substantial evidence rule respecting an ALJ'sfindings of fact and prohibits the introduction of new evidence after theinitial decision except in extraordinary circumstances. If these circumstancesare found, the Secretary remands the case to the ALJ. This section alsoprovides that the Secretary, for good cause, may remand a case to the ALJfor further briefing or for clarification and revision of the initial decision.Finally, this section describes the contents of any decision to modifyor set aside an ALJ's initial decision and the procedure for notifyingthe parties.   Section 81.54 describes when an ALJ's initial decision or the Secretary'sdecision on review becomes the final decision of the Department. Section81.55 describes how the Department collects a claim and sets out the standardsfor when collecting action may be undertaken. This section also recitesthe statutory prohibition against the Department's collecting interestfor the period between the date of the disallowance decision and the dateof the final decision of the Department.   <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291   </ITAG>These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executiveorder 12291.

(2) An identifiable Federal interest under paragraph (a)(1) of this sectionincludes, but is not limited to, the following: (i) Serving only eligible beneficiaries. (ii) Providing only authorized services or benefits. (iii) Complying with expenditure requirements and conditions, such as set-aside,excess cost, maintenance of effort, comparability, supplement-not-supplant,and matching requirements. (iv) Preserving the integrity of planning, application, recordkeeping,and reporting requirements. (v) Maintaining accountability for the use of funds. (b) The following examples illustrate how the standards for proportionalityapply. The examples present hypothetical cases and do not represent interpretationsof any actual program statute or regulation. (1) <T3>Ineligible beneficiaries. </T3>A State uses 15 percent of its grantto meet the special educational needs of children who were migratory, butwho have not migrated for more than five years as a Federal program statuterequires for eligibility to participate in the program. Result: Recoveryof 15 percent of the grant_all program funds spent for the benefit of thosechidren. Although the services were authorized, the children were not eligibleto receive them. (2) <T3>Ineligible beneficiaries. </T3>A Federal program designed to meet thespecial educational needs of gifted and talented children requires thatat least 80 percent of the children served in any project must be identifiedas gifted or talented. A local educational agency (LEA) conducts a projectin which 76 students are identified as gifted or talented and 24 are not.The project was designed and implemented to meet the special educationalneeds of gifted and talented students. Result: The LEA must return fivepercent of the project costs. The LEA provided authorized services, fora project in which the 76 target students had to constitute at least 80percent of the total. Thus, the maximum number of non-target students permittedwas 19. Project costs relating to the remaining five students must be returned.(3) <T3>Ineligible beneficiaries. </T3>Same as the example in paragraph (b)(2)of this section, except that only 15 percent of the children were identifiedas gifted or talented. On the basis of the low percentage of these childrenand other evidence, the authorized Departmental official finds that theproject as a whole did not address their special educational needs andwas outside the purpose of the statute. Result: The LEA must return itsentire award. The difference between the required percentage of giftedand talented children and the percentage actually enrolled is so substantialthat, if consistent with other evidence, the official may reasonably concludethe entire grant was misused. (4) <T3>Ineligible beneficiaries. </T3>Same as the example in paragraph (b)(2)of this section, except that 60 percent of the children were identifiedas gifted or talented, and it is not clear whether the project was designedor implemented to meet the special educational needs of these children.Result: If it is determined that the project was designed and implementedto serve their special educational needs, the LEA must return 25 percentof the project costs. A project that included 60 target children wouldmeet the requirement that 80 percent of the children served be gifted andtalented if it included no more than 15 other children. Thus, while theLEA provided authorized services, only 75 percent of the beneficiarieswere authorized to participate in the project (60 target children and 15others). If the authorized Departmental official, after examining all therelevant facts, determines that the project was not designed and implementedto serve the special educational needs of gifted or talented students,the LEA must return its entire award because it did not provide servicesauthorized by the statute. (5) <T3>Unauthorized activities. </T3>An LEA uses ten percent of its grantunder a Federal program intended to meet the special educational needsof educationally deprived children to pay for recreational trips to anamusement park and a circus. All the children are eligible to receive programservices. Result: Recovery of ten percent of the grant_all program fundsspent for the trips. Although the children were eligible to receive programservices, the trips were unrelated to a special educational need and, therefore,not authorized by law. (6) <T3>Set-aside requirement. </T3>A State uses 22 percent of its grant forone fiscal year under a Federal adult education program to provide programsof equivalency to a certificate of graduation from a secondary school.The adult education program statute restricts those programs to no morethan 20 percent of the State's grant. Result: Two percent of the State'sgrant must be returned. Although all 22 percent of the funds supportedadult education, the State had no authority to spend more than 20 percenton secondary school equivalency programs. (7) <T3>Set-aside requirement. </T3>A State uses eight percent of its basicState grant under a Federal vocational education program to pay for theexcess cost of vocational educational services and activities for handicappedindividuals. The program statute requires a State to use ten percent ofits basic State grant for this purpose. Result: The State must return twopercent of its basic State grant, regardless of how it was used. Becausethe State was required to spend that two percent on services and activitiesfor handicapped individuals and did not do so, it diverted those fundsfrom their intended purposes, and the Federal interest was harmed to thatextent. (8) <T3>Excess cost requirement. </T3>An LEA uses funds reserved for the disadvantagedunder a Federal vocational education program to pay for the cost of thesame vocational education services it provides to non-disadvantaged individuals.The program statute requires that funds reserved for the disadvantagedmust be used to pay only for the supplemental or additional costs of vocationaleducation services that are not provided to other individuals and thatare required for disadvantaged individuals to participate in vocationaleducation. Result: All the funds spent on the disadvantaged must be returned.Although the funds were spent to serve the disadvantaged, the funds wereavailable to pay for only the supplemental or additional costs of providingservices to the disadvantaged. (9) <T3>Maintenance-of-effort requirement. </T3>An LEA participates in a Federalprogram in fiscal year 1988 that requires it to maintain its expendituresfrom non-Federal sources of program purposes to receive its full allotment.The program statute requires that non-Federal funds expended in the firstpreceding fiscal year must be at least 90 percent of non-Federal fundsexpended in the second preceding fiscal year and provides for a reductionin grant amount proportional to the shortfall in expenditures. No waiverof the requirement is authorized. In fiscal year 1986 the LEA spent $100,000from non-Federal sources for program purposes; in fiscal year 1987, only$87,000. Result: The LEA must return 1/30 of its fiscal year 1988 grant_theamount of its grant that equals the proportion of its shortfall ($3,000)to the required level of expenditures ($90,000). If, instead, maintenanceof expenditures were a clear condition of the LEA's eligibility to receivefunds and there were no provisions for a proportional reduction in thegrant award, the LEA would be required to return its entire grant.(10) <T3>Supplanting prohibition. </T3>An LEA uses funds under a Federal drugeducation program to provide drug abuse prevention information to studentsin the eight grade. The LEA is required to provide that information underState law. Funds under the Federal program statute are subject to a supplement-not-supplantrequirement. Result: All the funds used to provide the required informationto the eighth-grade students must be returned. The Federal funds did notincrease the total amount of spending for program purposes because theinformation would have been provided with non-Federal funds if the Federalfunds were not available. (11) <T3>Matching requirement.</T3> A State receives an allotment of $90,000for fiscal year 1988 under a Federal adult education program. It expendsits full allotment and $8,000 from its own resources for adult education.Under the Federal statute, the Federal share of expenditures for the State'sprogram is 90 percent. Result: The State must return the unmatched Federalfunds, or $18,000. Expenditure of a $90,000 Federal allotment required$10,000 in matching State expenditures, $2,000 more than the State's actualexpenditures. At a ratio of one State dollar for every nine Federal dollars,$18,000 in Federal funds was unmatched.    (12) <T3>Application requirements.</T3> An LEA submits an application to itsState educational agency (SEA) for a subgrant of Federal program fundsto carry out school-level basic skills development programs. After it receivesthe Federal funds, it decides instead to use 20 percent of the funds tocarry out a program for gifted and talented elementary school students,but does not amend its application to the SEA. Result: 20 percent of theLEA's subgrant must be returned. The LEA had no authority under the Federalstatute to use the funds except as provided by its approved local application.The statutorily required planning process was circumvented and accountabilityfor the proper use of Federal funds was not maintained.    (13) <T3>Application requirements.</T3> Under a State-administered program,an LEA is required to submit an application to its SEA, which must approvethat application before it may make a subgrant to the LEA. The LEA neversubmits an application, but the SEA awards a subgrant anyway. The LEA usesthe subgrant to carry out activities that would have been authorized ifincluded in an approved local application. Result: The SEA must returnthe amount of the subgrant. The statutorily required planning process wascircumvented, specific application requirements were avoided, and accountabilitywas not maintained.    (14) <T3>Harmless violation.</T3> Under a Federal program, a grantee is requiredto establish a 15-member advisory council of affected teachers, schooladministrators, parents, and students to assist in program design, monitoring,and evaluation. Although the law requires at least three student membersof the council, a grantee's council contains only two. The project is carriedout, and no damage to the project attributable to the lack of a third studentmember can be identified. Result: No financial recovery is required, althoughthe grantee must take other appropriate steps to come into compliance withthe law. The grantee's violation has not measurably harmed a Federal interestassociated with the program.  <ITAG tagnum="20"/>(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e-3(a)(1), 1234(f)(1), 1234b(a), 3474(a))   <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 81.43 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Mitigating circumstances.  </ITAG>(a) A recipient that is a State or local educational agency and made anunallowable expenditure or otherwise failed to account properly for fundsis not required to return any amount that is attributable to the mitigatingcircumstances described in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section.
