Police fired tear gas to break up the rallies in Masan, Seoul,Pusan, Suwon and Taegu. Witnesses reported some arrests and injuriesbut police had no figures.   In the southern industrial city of Masan, 205 miles south ofSeoul, 5,000 workers fought police for hours, demanding thegovernment investigate violence against union leaders.   Police and protesters clashed severral times after a scheduledmarch by the demonstrators through downtown arreas was blocked.``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Stop suppressing labor movement!''the protesters shouted.   In Seoul, more than 1,000 combat-clad riot police and fourarmored vehicles firing tear gas stormed the sprawling campus ofSeoul National University to break up an anti-government rally.   Students shouted ``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!'' and hurled stones atthe police befoe being beaten back. Witnesses said some studentsattacked police with clubs and metal pipes.   There were many injuries but no arrests were reported.   In Pusan, the nation's second-largest city, about 1,600 studentsbattled riot police with firebombs and rocks during ralliesdemanding the release of a radical student arrested for making anillegal trip to communist North Korea in defiance of a governmentban.   Hundreds of radical students in Taegu and Suwon also clashed withriot police after anti-government campus rallies in support ofworkers, farmers and unionized teachers punished or reprimanded byauthorities.   The demonstrations had strong anti-U.S. overtones. Many studentsshouted slogans demanding the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troopsstationed here under a mutual defense treaty. They claimed the U.S.military presence hinders prospects of unification with North Korea,a key demand by radicals.   Radicals are a small but vocal minority in South Korea and havelittle public support because of their extreme actions and views.Officials estimate they number about 20,000 in a nation of 42million.   Also in the capital Wednesday, farmers opposed to U.S. foodimports protested for a second day outside a downtown hotel that isthe site of an American food fair. Several hundred police weredeployed to prevent violence. No clashes were reported.   The farmers displayed placards and distributing leafletsdemanding a halt to American food imports.   ``Farmers are losing their zest for life as prices of domesticfarm products plunge and debts of farming households snowball,'' oneappeal said. ``Let us block foreign pressure for the opening ofimports of farm products.''   The two-day fair began Wednesday and is the first major Americanfood promotion staged in South Korea. It represents 57 food productsand organizations from 15 states.   South Korean farmers have staged violent demonstrations demandingthe Seoul government halt imports of U.S. agricultural products,which they say will dominate the domestic market and threaten theirlivelihood.   ``We have no problem at all with people demonstrating for whatthey believe in,'' George Pope, agricultural counselor at the U.S.Embassy, told a news conference. ``We realize the extremesensitivity of Korean liberalization (of food) to Korea and theKorean farmers.''   Under pressure from Washington, the Seoul government this yearagreed to relax controls on the import of 243 agricultural, marineand forestry products, a move that angered Korean farmers.   The United States imported $100 million worth of agriculturalproducts from South Korea in 1988, Pope said. Food exports to SouthKorea were $2.3 billion, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
