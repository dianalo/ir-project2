Gorbachev could causehuge layoffs, but hoped that sympathetic Soviet republics wouldbalk at the president's order.   In Leningrad, 5,000 people gathered at the Winter Palace for aprotest rally that included appeals to strike in support ofLithuania if Gorbachev pursues a blockade, according to Leningradjournalist Maxim Korzhov.   Gorbachev gave Lithuania until Sunday to back away from itsdeclaration of independence or face a halt in deliveries ofexportable goods. That could include all the oil and gas used inthe small Baltic republic, as well as metal, machinery, chemicals,cotton and automobiles.   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis has said the March 11declaration of independence will not be revoked.   Landsbergis, speaking at a news conference shown on the Sovietevening TV news, said Gorbachev's ultimatum would not even bediscussed until Tuesday, since predominantly Roman CatholicLithuania will still be celebrating the Easter holiday Monday.   ``It is impossible to give the answer in two days. ... This is away to delay negotiations and try to present it as if Lithuaniadoesn't want negotiations,'' he said.   He said it was unclear whether the Soviets planned a full orpartial blockade or some other sort of limitation on Lithuania'seconomic activities.   Lithuanian economist and legislator Kazimieras Antanavicius saida Soviet blockade would close factories, and laid-off workers maynot be able to handle losing their paychecks indefinitely. ``Manyworkers live only from paycheck to paycheck, without savings,'' hesaid.   That hardship could cause the republic's government to considera temporary suspension of the independence declaration if necessaryto persuade Gorbachev to negotiate, Antanavicius said.   Western advisers to the Lithuanian government have said therepublic's economic survival is tied to its ability to maintain itstrade with the Soviet Union.   But with at least four other Soviet republics and numerouslocalities now controlled by progressives who support Lithuania'sbid for independence, Lithuania is hoping for gaping holes inGorbachev's blockade.   Lithuanian leaders said they expected some republics with theirown independence movements to resist Gorbachev's order.   ``We don't think individual republics will go along with this,especially republics like Azerbaijan and Georgia, which wantindependence,'' said Aidas Palubinskas, a spokesman for theLithuanian parliament. ``They understand they are going to be inthe same boat.''   Latvia and Estonia, the other two Baltic republics, are alsopressing for independence, though more cautiously than Lithuania.On Friday, they signed an economic cooperation agreement withLithuania that promises mutual aid in emergencies.   Landsbergis told reporters Saturday night that Lithuania istrying to contract directly with Soviet enterprises for itssupplies, according to Edward Tuskenis, another parliamentspokesman. The Soviet system still requires most deals to gothrough Moscow ministries.   Several weeks ago, a representative from the largest Soviet oilfields, located in Tyumen, appeared in Vilnius to ask if Lithuaniawould buy directly from his enterprise.   Reacting to Gorbachev's threat, Landsbergis expressed reliefthat Gorbachev chose economic pressure rather than military force.``We expected worse,'' he said.   In the month since Lithuania declared its independence, theKremlin has alternated between making threats and conciliatoryoffers. Soviet troops have occupied some buildings in Vilnius, thecapital, and conscripts who refused to serve in the Red Army havebeen detained.   Speaking of the latest threat, Landsbergis was quoted by theindependent newsletter Glasnost as saying: ``The government ofLithuania foresaw this and was ready for it immediately after thedeclaration of independence.'' He said the republic can continueone or two months, but even then, ``it is not a death blow for us.''   Most important, ``Lithuania cannot starve,'' Palubinskas said.It produces more meat and milk than it consumes, so customers inMoscow and Leningrad would see their already meager food suppliesshrink, he said.   However, weeks before the declaration of independence, aparliamentary commission reported that oil and gas supplies wouldbe critical in the drive for freedom. Buying them on the openmarket would be vastly more expensive than paying subsidized Sovietprices.   ``At world market prices, we would be running a deficit of $700million for oil alone,'' concluded a summary of the parliamentaryreport printed in the newspaper Lithuanian Review.   The same report said Lithuania produces 60 percent of certainSoviet television parts and 30 percent of key tractor components.The Soviet economy is already tottering from inefficiency andpolitical strikes.   In addition, Lithuania might retaliate by demanding world pricesfor exporting Soviet oil, gas and other products through its BalticSea ports, particularly Klaipeda.   Officials of the republic hope Western countries will come totheir aid, particularly with oil. So far, though, there have beenno public promises.   On Saturday, President Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcherof Britain urged Gorbachev to drop his threat and open talks withLithuania.   ``Now is no time for escalation,'' Bush said after he and Mrs.Thatcher met for talks in Hamilton, Bermuda.   Britain's foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, said Saturday that ifMoscow uses coercion instead of dialogue to keep Lithuania in itsfold, ``there will be a penalty to pay in terms of Russia'sdealings with the West.''   Hurd, who spoke in an interview with Press Association,Britain's domestic news agency, did not elaborate.   Pope John Paul II on Saturday met with Gorbachev aide VadimZagladin, but Vatican officials declined to say what was discussed.The pontiff sent an Easter telegram to Cardinal VincentasSkadkevicius of Lithuania, which is predominantly Roman Catholic.</TEXT></DOC>
