Pedestrian malls were tried and then half removed. Downtown is still dead. It's unrealistic to say that the malls failed. Anything you try fails unless you provide free, ample parking, and you're not going to do it with parking garages. The city governments just can't get it through their heads that parking is No. 1. The answer is in the back of the book. The tragic part is that we're sitting on the book, and we're too lazy to get up.    Val Palmer   Rockford, Ill.</TEXT></DOC>
