Mr. Reagan said he will consult &quot;personally&quot; with NATO allies and bipartisan leaders in Congress before responding fully to the Soviet proposal. The proposal would begin negotiations to abolish all short-range nuclear missiles from Europe within a year of an agreement to dismantle all medium-range missiles.    &quot;Important progress was made in arms reductions. On intermediate-range nuclear missiles, we've narrowed the gaps a little more,&quot; said Mr. Reagan. &quot;After we consult with allies, we may have new ideas to offer. I remain optimistic about an agreement this year. There was movement on nuclear-testing talks and on a ban on chemical weapons.&quot;    Mr. Reagan said talks about &quot;strategic defensive reductions and defense in space&quot; were &quot;detailed and useful and will intensify.&quot;    Mr. Reagan denied a suggestion that Mr. Gorbachev has &quot;boxed in&quot; NATO by proposing to eliminate short-range nuclear missiles with ranges of 300 to 600 miles. The alliance had hoped for an agreement that would have allowed NATO to deploy short-range missiles at levels equal to those of the Soviets.    Mr. Shultz, who flew to California after briefing NATO members, said: &quot;We had a very good meeting in Brussels this morning and reviewed the whole process, and I think the opportunities before us -- and we have different alternative ways to go -- are all very positive.&quot;    Mr. Shultz said it &quot;isn't fair&quot; to say that the NATO allies disagree with the proposal that they give up not only the medium-range missiles, but the short-range ones as well. &quot;We're discussing that and they're taking counsel and we'll come to a view,&quot; he said.    &quot;It's fair to say people are considering an important offer that the Soviets put on the table when I was in Moscow,&quot; the secretary continued. &quot;You don't just react to things like that, you think them over.&quot;    Mr. Shultz later said that the president will give the U.S. response &quot;very shortly.&quot; Mr. Reagan said he is &quot;hopeful&quot; for a summit meeting this year with Mr. Gorbachev, but he added, &quot;It must be one that is carefully planned and prepared&quot; and &quot;there has to be some substantial agreements that make it worthwhile having a summit.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
