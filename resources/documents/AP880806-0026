Delegations from the three countries announced Friday in Genevathat they had agreed on an unspecified ``sequence of steps'' toachieve peace in southwestern Africa.   The Star, South Africa's largest daily, said in an unattributedreport that the steps included a cease-fire.   It said that according to the agreement, South African troopswere to withdraw from southern Angola, and Cuban forces were towithdraw to at least 60 miles north of Angola's border withSouth-West Africa, also known as Namibia.   Angola-based guerrillas of the South-West African People'sOrganization, the main guerrilla group fighting for Namibianindependence, also would be required to pull away from the border,The Star said.   The four-day session in Switzerland was the fifth round ofU.S.-mediated talks aimed at resolving the war in Angola andgranting independence to Namibia. The talks began in May.   Details of the agreement reached there were to be disclosed nextweek after negotiators report to their governments.   Another round of talks is to take place within three weeks, withthe exact date and location to be announced.   On Tuesday, South Africa unveiled a proposal calling for acease-fire in Angola on Wednesday and independence for Namibia byJune 1, 1989 if Cuba withdraws its estimated 50,000 troops fromAngola by that date.   Cuba and Angola publicly rejected the proposal, but the talksproceeded.   Cuba previously offered to withdraw its troops from Angola overa four-year period. The troops have helped the Marxist governmentfight the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, orUNITA, a guerrilla movement which receives military aid from SouthAfrica and the United States.   A spokesman for UNITA in Lisbon, Alcides Sakala, indicated hisorganization would not observe a cease-fire unless it is broughtinto the negotiations.   ``As long as UNITA is not a part of the (peace) process, nochange will come about in Angola,'' he said Friday.   In July, parties to the talks announced agreement on a set of 14principles as a framework for a settlement.   A joint statement issued then did not mention the role of UNITA,South-West African People's Organization or the African NationalCongress, the main black group fighting white rule in South Africa.   South Africa called in its proposals Tuesday for the dismantlingof seven guerrilla camps it said were operated in Angola by theANC. It was not clear whether this was addressed in Geneva.   South Africa also proposed to start withdrawing its estimated50,000 troops from Namibia on Nov. 1. South Africa's mandate overNamibia was terminated by the United Nations in 1966, but it hasretained control over the territory in defiance of several U.N.Security Council resolutions.</TEXT></DOC>
