They want us to breakthe union as far as I'm concerned.''   Members of the electricians, laborers and plasterers unions alsohave authorized strikes today against the producers, said Bush, whoestimated the number of workers on strike will total 3,300 to3,500. There was no immediate answer at the offices of the otherthree unions.   The Hollywood plumbers union, the smallest of five craftsunions, announced last week it would not strike.   Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for television and film producers,had said previously that the strike by the 2,200 Teamsters wouldnot cripple the film and television industry. Hollywood is justbeginning to return to full speed following the 22-week strike bythe Writers Guild of America that ended in August.   Under their contracts, the writers and members of other talentunions such as actors and directors cannot honor picket lines setup by craft unions such as the Teamsters.   Bush said the Teamsters made several concessions, but they wereall rejected by the producers. Strikers targeted two sites forpicketing today: the Santa Monica Pier, where NBC's ``Hunter'' isbeing filmed, and at the Hollywood office of the show's producer,Stephen J. Cannell. About two dozen pickets arrived outside theoffice shortly after 5:30 a.m.   Teamster driver Clyde Lucas said he didn't find out about thestrike until he arrived for work early today at the ParamountStudios. ``I assumed we were going to work,'' Lucas said. ``Butwhen I arrived at the studios, there was a lockout.''   Federally mediated talks began Friday morning followingThursday's announcement that the union had voted 1,441-196 toreject what the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producerssaid was their last contract offer.   Both sides remained at the bargaining table for a series oftalks during the weekend at the alliance's headquarters in suburbanSherman Oaks. Sunday's session, which began at 5 p.m., lasted morethan eight hours, Bush said.   Bush has called the producers' offer ``the worst contract offerever made to a union.''   The drivers are responsible for transporting everything fromstars to equipment and props to and from the sets, said unionspokesman Mike Shepherd.   Key issues dividing the two sides include overtime rules,salaries and guidelines for the making of non-union films. SomeTeamster drivers are being asked to take a pay cut from $16.61 to$14 per hour.   ``We'll strike until we can get a settlement we can live with,''Bush said following the vote.   The producers have said their terms are final and there is noroom for further negotiations. They contend the pay cuts arenecessary if production costs in Hollywood are to remaincompetitive.   ``We have trained drivers and we're ready to continue productionunder any circumstances,'' Steinberg said previously. ``I don'tthink it will have any impact on production. The studios are verywell prepared.''</TEXT></DOC>
