The offer, which was to have ended last Sunday, is now set to expire March 6.    The steelmaker said 31.7%, or about $104.7 million, of its 13 1/2% subordinated sinking fund debentures due 2000, and 21.1%, or about $12.7 million, of its 14 1/4% subordinated sinking fund debentures due 1999, had been tendered as of Friday.    Sharon said the pending sale of its Mueller unit is conditioned, among other things, on a total of 80% of the face amount of debentures being tendered in the swap offer. </TEXT></DOC>
