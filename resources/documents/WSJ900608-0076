The Fed chairman's tight-fisted policies haveadministration officials on edge. They believe last month'sweak employment growth should have prodded the Fed to ease;they argue that with the economy already growing at less than2% a year, a stingy Fed could mistakenly tip that intonegative numbers.</LP><TEXT>   But the big issue, Bush aides say, is whether the Fed willprovide a major cut in short-term rates if there is a budgetaccord with Congress. The administration thinks a deal shouldbe worth at least 1 1/2 percentage points. But Greenspanindicates the Fed would pursue a more cautious path.   &quot;The odds are high they will move when the time comes,&quot;says an administration aide. &quot;The question is whether it willbe far enough or fast enough.&quot;                                                                                                          MANDELA AIMS to use his U.S. trip to keep the heat onSouth Africa.   Despite President de Klerk's partial lifting of the stateof emergency, the African National Congress leader will usehis June 26 speech to a joint session of Congress to rebutarguments from U.S. conservatives that sanctions should beeased. He will stress the importance of isolating SouthAfrica until apartheid truly is dead.   The rest of his trip will be used to generate U.S.political support and raise money. In addition to a New Yorkticker-tape parade, he plans appearances in Boston, Atlanta,Detroit and Oakland, as well as a Miami address to AFSCME tothank organized labor for its anti-apartheid stance. A majorevent in Los Angeles will seek financial support from theentertainment industry.                                                                                                          SUMMIT DEALS raise political hackles in both the SovietUnion and U.S.   Soviet press commentaries increasingly complain that whilethe Soviets are giving up their military edge on land, Bushrefuses to negotiate cuts in navies, a traditional area ofAmerican strength. Shevardnadze warns Baker that the newlyindependent Supreme Soviet might balk at ratifying pacts itsees as unequal.   In the U.S., meanwhile, conservatives criticize the tradetreaty and other economic moves as sops to Gorbachev justwhen he is losing power to Yeltsin and others. &quot;Bush is aboutsix months behind in understanding how far along thedisintegration of the Soviet Union is,&quot; says HeritageFoundation official Kim Holmes.   Conservatives complain the chemical weapons treaty isn'tverifiable.                                                                                                          DEMOCRATS CHEER the weak showing of Montana GOP Senatecandidate Kolstad in Tuesday's primary; they now think Sen.Baucus could have an easier time than anticipated. TheRepublicans, meanwhile, say North Carolina Sen. Helms willhave no problem painting Democratic nominee Gantt, who isblack, as ultraliberal. But Democratic strategists thinkGantt will be able to raise a lot of money for his uphillbattle.                                                                                                          SPRING SLUMP? The high-powered Democratic politicalconsulting firm of Doak, Shrum andamp; Associates isn't off to agood start this year. Their candidates have already losthigh-stakes gubernatorial primaries in Texas, California andIowa, and trail in Georgia and Florida. Says Bob Shrum:&quot;Unlike some people in this business, we do difficultcampaigns.&quot;                                                                                                          NERVOUS REGULATORS await Tuesday's first-quarter bankingreport. Delinquencies on consumer loans have been creeping upin recent quarters; the number typically drops off in thefirst quarter, but that might not happen this time, whichwould indicate consumers are living beyond their means andthat banks ought to worry.                                                                                                          INFRA REDS: Gorbachev had hardly left town when salesmenfor the Soviet space agency arrived to pitch their Almazradar satellite, which can take pictures through cloud coverand at night. The Soviets believe the technology --originally developed to track U.S. aircraft carriers -- willdraw customers ranging from oil companies to urban planners.                                                                                                          PRESSURE GROWS to allow more flights into alreadycongested airports.   Prodded by upstart America West Airlines, the SenateCommerce Committee is working on a bill to loosen oreliminate limits on the number of flights into LaGuardia,JFK, O'Hare and Washington National. Landing rights arecurrently dominated by more-established carriers, leadingnewer competitors to complain they are shut out of lucrativemarkets.   Transportation Department officials worry that changingthe current system would increase noise and overcrowdingproblems, and could raise safety questions as well. To defusecongressional pressure, though, they might fashion acompromise requiring airlines that don't use their slotsenough to cede them to others.   Secretary Skinner says the issue is &quot;something we wish wedidn't have to decide.&quot;                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: The sole GOP candidate to oppose Georgia Sen.Nunn withdrew from the race after the check for her filingfee bounced. . . . Ever since Gorbachev threw a horseshoeringer at Camp David, White House chief of staff Sununuclaims he's being accused of magnetizing the stake to assuresuccess. . . . Departing FDIC chief Seidman, a last-minutespeech replacement for Quayle, said he was disappointedbecause he wanted to hear what the vice president thinks --&quot;if he does&quot; -- about the competitive woes of U.S. banks.</TEXT></DOC>
