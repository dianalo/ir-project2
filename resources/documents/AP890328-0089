Government negotiators held a second day of talks with leadersof the rebellion that began Sunday, when friends and relatives ofinmates were visiting the prison.   The Roman Catholic priest who is chaplain of Guatemalan prisonssaid he considered most of the more than 600 visitors still insidePavon penitentiary ``virtual hostages.''   ``Though some are there by choice, the rebellious prisoners knowthat they (the family members) are their protection. They know thatonce they are gone, the armed forces could try to retake thefacility,'' the Rev. Antonio Lopez Martin said before entering theprison.   Authorities said at least four guards and three inmates werekilled and 20 people wounded as prisoners seized about 75 M-1rifles and tried to escape Sunday.   About 1,000 soldiers and police joined the prison's 180 guardsoutside the 2.5 square-mile facility, where inmates were demandingbetter food and reduced sentences.   Prison spokesman Conrado Monroy told reporters friends andrelatives ``fear that if they leave, authorities will takereprisals against the rebel inmates.''   The inspector-general of the National Prisons System, CarlosRamos Moncada, said he believes the visitors are not hostages.   ``They remain there by choice,'' he said. ``The family membersstill inside are backing the movement.''   Ramos Moncada said 607 people besides the up to 100 rebelliousinmates remained inside the prison.   Officials said the visitors on Sunday included more than 150children, 360 women and 100 men.   Esmirla Cheti, 19, walked out today with her nephew Edgar, 13.She said they were visiting a friend when the uprising occurred andshe remained voluntarily for two days.   ``But we were also afraid about what might happen if we tried toleave,'' she said. ``We were going to leave last night, but they(the prisoners) told us to wait until morning.''   She said some people have food in the prison, but other peoplewere going hungry.   President Vinicio Cerezo ordered prison and other authorities``to exhaust every alternative'' in negotiating a solution.   Ramos Moncada said Monday night that ``serious problems remain''in resolving the standoff. ``(The rebels) must reform their conductand surrender the weapons.''   He said six people who were hostages _ four doctors and twofirefighters _ were released at midday Monday. He said the rest ofthe people inside the prison were considered to be supporting theuprising.   On Monday night, inmates escorted 15 adults and four childrenout of the prison.   Ramos Moncada said the rebellious prisoners had about 75 M-1rifles taken from prison guard dormitories.   He said their demands _ for better food and reduced sentences _had not changed since Sunday and that they did not demand a planeto fly to Cuba as reported by a local radio station.   The roughly 1,250 prisoners who did not take part in theuprising apparently remained in areas of the prison outside therebels' control.   Clementina Diaz and her 2-year-old son, Miguel Angel, were amongthose who left the prison Monday night.   Mrs. Diaz, who was visiting her eldest son Gerardo on Sunday,said she left because her little boy had a fever. She said inmatesasked visitors if they had health problems that made their stayimpossible.   Another visitor who left, Alicia Rodriguez, cried as she spokefrom inside a Red Cross van outside the gate. She had been visitingher husband.   ``I was sick from nerves,'' she said to explain her departure.</TEXT></DOC>
