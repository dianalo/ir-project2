The peacekeepers constantly patrol the tense front lines, whichstretch from the snowy Kurdistan mountain in the north to thesouthern deserts. They travel on foot or in military vehiclespainted white.   ``The temperature in the north today was minus 31 Centrigrade,''said Lt. Col. John Fisher, a New Zealander with the U.N. Iran-IraqMilitary Observer Group in the southern sector of the 730-mile frontbetween the neighboring nations. ``But here in the south, it was 31plus. In the north, our observers operate on skis or snowshoes.''   He said the process of cementing the cease-fire is slow work.   ``We're still involved in negotiations with both sides aboutdisengagement,'' said Fisher.   In the six months since the Aug. 20 U.N.-sponsored cease-firetook effect, the U.N. observers have negotiated with both sides toachieve a buffer zone up to 1\-mile wide, Fisher told a group offoreign correspondents Wednesday.   The U.N. observers' base camp, which comprises neat rows ofportable cabins pained white, is about 25 miles south of Ahvaz,capital of Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province and one of the mostheavily damaged regions during the war.   A long drive through the region indicated that life is generallyback to normal in the region.   Ahvaz, a sprawling market town and oil center, bustled during theday. At night, its wide tree-lined avenues were ablaze withthousands of colored lights strung from lamp posts and buildings forthe 10-day celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of the Islamicrevolution.   In the flat, dusty countryside near the front, women tilled andwatered the fields while men repaired war-damaged buildings or builtnew houses to replace those lost in heavy Iraqi bombing.   In the area around the small town of Susangerd, once occupied byIraqi soldiers, Iran's special Construction Crusade brigades werebusy. Helped by villagers, the teams of bearded young men of theIslamic Revolutionary Guards Corps were digging new irrigationcanals or extending existing ones with earth-moving machinery.   The concrete canals, which could serve as anti-tank ditches iffighting breaks out again, run for miles along the border.   Despite the cease-fire, both armies still have large forces alongthe cease-fire line.   Fisher acknowledged that in some stretches, the rival forces arestill only 25 yards apart.   He also said truce violations have occurred as reported.   ``On the whole,'' he added, ``it's been very quiet. I see noreason why it shouldn't continue like this.''   He declined comment on a statement by Iranian Foreign MinisterAli Akbar Velayati that the Iraqis recently seized 39 square milesof Iranian territory.   The Iranians say the Iraqis still occupy a total of more than 380square miles of their territory.   With U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar striving tobreak the deadlock in the talks aimed at a permanent settlement,Fisher commented: ``The future is in the hands of the politicians.''   The Iranians have said that resuming talks that broke down inNovember was futile unless Iraq withdraws from Iranian soil. Iraqrejects any preconditions.   The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday extended the U.N.observers' mandate for another six months. It repeated its calls forIran and Iraq to withdraw their forces to the pre-war border, one ofthe key provisions of the cease-fire resolution passed in July 1987.   At least 1 million people were killed or wounded in the war,which began with an Iraqi invasion in September 1980 after severalborder skirmishes. Some estimates of the dead alone surpass 1million, and the economic cost totals hundreds of billions ofdollars.   Fisher said new officers have been arriving to replace those inthe 409-member U.N. force from 26 countries.   Diplomats in Baghdad reported Wednesday that 10 officers fromIran and 10 from Iraq will meet in a no-man's land in the centralsector this month in an effort to advance the cease-fire provisions.</TEXT></DOC>
