Ostriker, Thompsonand Witten (OTW) [Phys. Lett. B180, 231-239 (1986)] have shown that thelow-frequency electromagnetic radiation from superconducting closed loopscan sweep away the surrounding plasma, and have identified the resultingbubbles of radiation with the voids observed in the large-scale distributionof galaxies. Here I discuss some observational consequences of the OTWmodel. It will be shown that it predicts observable fluxes of {gamma}-raysand ultra-high energy cosmic rays from long strings stretching acrossthe visible universe.</TEXT></DOC>
