 Relational TechnologyIncorporated finally succumbed to the trend and changed its name to IngresCorporation.andP;  This not only trades on the success of its Ingres relationaldatabase management system (RDBMS), but also makes life easier for those whowrite about the company.andM;Ingres also made a major product announcement that moves it out in front ofits competitors in several areas, and got started on a new program ofOracle-bashing.andP;  No more Mr. Nice Guy for Ingres.andP;  This is one company that'shad enough.andP;  Long viewed as a company with good technology and engineeringand lousy marketing (Ingres likens itself to Hewlett-Packard in thewell-known story about HP's honest marketing techniques: if HP marketedsushi, it would call the product &quot;cold dead fish&quot;), Ingres has taken repeatedblows from Oracle's impressive marketing program.andP;  Ingres is now out todifferentiate itself, and to make its strategy and products crystal-clear incomparison to those of the competition.andM;The new features of Version 6.3, called the Ingres Intelligent Database,focus on the database server rather than front-end tools.andP;  Version 6.3introduces data management enhancements as well as two optional new products:the Ingres Object Management and Knowledge Management extensions.andM;The new version of Ingres takes the product significantly beyond what Oraclecan offer today; it also implements a number of the features that haveimpressed us about Sybase, and more.andP;  It's another salve in the database warthat continues to keep all combatants working to improve the functionality oftheir products and clarify their strategies and advantages.andM;DATA MANAGEMENT ENHANCEMENTS.andP;  In late 1988, a rearchitected, multiserverversion of Ingres (Version 6) was introduced.andP;  The objective was to enhanceboth performance and functionality in order to better meet the requirementsof online transaction processing (OLTP) applications.andP;  In addition to theability to take advantage of multiprocessing, other major improvements weredatabase procedures and reductions in I/O overhead.andM;Compiled database procedures are functions written in the Ingres 4GL whichare compiled, stored, and managed by the database server.andP;  Typically, theseare used for predefined transactions.andP;  The benefit is the ability to write aprocedure once that can be accessed by multiple applications, reducing theneed for logic in the application itself.andP;  Other benefits include reducednetwork traffic and easier maintenance, since the procedure only has to bechanged in one place.andP;  Compiled database procedures are comparable toSybase's stored procedures.andM;I/O reduction techniques include fast commit (deferred writes), group commit(piggybacked commit), multiblock reads, and multiblock writes.andM;Building on this base, Version 6.3 adds several significant features to thedatabase server:andM;* Two-phase commit protocol, which is a critical component for supportingdistributed database processing across multiple sites in a single logicaltransaction.andP;  A two-phase commit protocol decomposes the commit operationinto two phases (prepare-to-commit and commit) so that a multisite update iseither committed or rolled back by all participating sites.andP;  This isnecessary to maintain data integrity.andM;* Online backup for high availability, which is an important consideration inonline transaction processing (OLTP) systems.andM;* Improved optimization of subqueries.andM;* International language support for sorting sequences, error messages, and2-byte character set.andM;* An increase in the maximum columns per table to 300 fom 127.andM;* The ability to activate the fast-commit feature in a multiserverenvironment.andM;KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT.andP;  The Knowledge Management extension to the Ingresserver introduces a rules system that can be used to capture both referentialintegrity constraints and business policies in the database server itself.andO;It allows for the definition of an unlimited number of independent rules pertable; rules can be nested (to unlimited levels) and recursive.andP;  This goesbeyond what Sybase, for example, has implemented in its triggers.andP;  Sybasetriggers are limited to one per table for each of the data manipulationoperations (insert, delete, and update), can only be nested 16 deep, andcannot be recursive.andM;Knowledge Management also contains a resurce control system and an accesscontrol system.andP;  The resource control system allows the administrator to tellthe server how much in the way of resources each user can consume.andP;  Limitsare associated with the user authorization profile.andP;  If the user tries toexecute a query that will exceed this limit (as evaluated by the queryoptimizer), the server rejects the query.andP;  The important point here is thatthe query is rejected before it is executed, not after the limit has beenreached (e.g., after the 1,000th row has been retrieved, if that is thedefined limit).andP;  This reduces the potential conflict between ad hoc andproduction users of a database, and eliminates unpredictable performance.andM;The access control system adds group and application permissions to thestandard individual user permissions for access to data in a database.andP;  Thus,the administrator can define a group called &quot;marketing&quot; and grant the entiregroup specific levels of access to data.andP;  Applications can also be givenpermission to access data.andM;OBJECT MANAGEMENT.andP;  The Object Management extension allows the creation ofuser-defined data types, such as geographic coordinates (longitude andlatitude), temperatures, weights, and time-series data.andP;  The user can alsodefine operators and functions to be used with these data types--the abilityto calculate the distance between two locations, convert pounds to ounces,and calculate the volume.andP;  For example, the user could teach Ingres aboutinches, feet, yards, etc.andP;  and how to add and multiply these user-definedvalues.andP;  The data types can be manipulated using standards SQL.andM;According to Ingres, this is &quot;phase 1&quot; of its implementation of objectmanagement in the database.andP;  There is no inheritance, compound objects, orsubclasses yet, but the company is in the process of evaluating thesecapabilities.andP;  The primary goal is to make Ingres SQL-based and fast first,and then to enhance it with additional functionality as required.andM;AVAILABILITY.andP;  The Ingres Intelligent Database product suite was available inNovember for Digital's VAX/VMS, and will be ported to a variety of Unixplatforms in the first half of 1990.andP;  The data management extensions are afree upgrade for current Ingres installations on a maintenance contract.andP;  TheKnowledge Management extension costs 30 percent of the base license fee forthe Ingres DBMS.andP;  The Object Management extension costs 50 percent.andO;Together, they can be acquired for a total fee of 60 percent of the baselicense cost.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
