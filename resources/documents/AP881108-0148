Police said the dead guerrillas were members of theFatah-Revolutionary Council led by terrorist Abu Nidal, whose realname is Sabry al-Banna.   They were trying to infiltrate west of Jezzine, a Christianmountain town controlled by the South Lebanon Army, a predominatnlyChristian force of 2,000 men led by Maj. Gen. Antoine Lahd, a61-year-old former Lebanese army officer.   The police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standingregulations, said he had no information about casualties among themilitiamen, who patrol Israel's ``security zone'' just north of theborder along with about 1,000 Israeli soldiers.   Israeli army headquarters said there were no SLA casualties.   A statement earlier Tuesday from the Lebanese National ResistanceFront, a coalition of Syrian-backed leftist groups, said itanticipated ``an Israeli strike'' because Lahd was shot and woundedMonday night.   It said a woman member of the front shot Lahd with a pistol athis home in Marjayoun, four miles north of the border in the Israelizone, which ranges in depth from six to 10 miles. She was capturedby Lahd's militiamen.   Zvi Ben-Ishai, spokesman for the Rambam Hospital in Haifa, saidLahd was in stable condition Tuesday after surgery on his right armand upper chest to repair a damaged blood vessel.   In the pro-Syrian group's statement, the woman was identified asSoha Fawaz Bishara, 21, a Christian teacher from Deir Mimas villagein the zone. The statement, accompanied by a photograph of Ms.Bishara, said she was a member of the Lebanese Communist Party in1982-1987 and then joined the front, which includes the communists.   Beirut newspapers published the statement, which said the attackon Lahd was in support of the 11-month-old Palestinian uprising inthe Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Lahd, a Maronite Catholic, took over the militia in September1984 after his predecessor, Maj. Saad Haddad, died of cancer inIsrael. Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces from Lebanon in June1985, after three years of invasion and occupation.   The statement by the pro-Syrian group claimed Lahd was preparingto declare an independent state in territory his militia holds tosupport the government led by Lebanon's army commander, Gen. MichelAoun.   President Amin Gemayel named Aoun head of a caretaker Cabinetwhen his six-year term expired Sept. 23 and Parliament had notelected a successor.   Christian lawmakers had boycotted Parliament, protestingSyrian-backed Christian candidates on the grounds they would turnLebanon into a Syrian satellite.   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem,rejected Aoun's appointment and insisted his own Cabinet was thelegitimate authority. Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist factionssupported him, deepening Lebanon's partition along sectarian linesafter 13 years of civil war.   By tradition, Lebanon's president is Christian, the primeminister Sunni Moslem and the Parliament speaker Shiite Moslem.   Voice of the South, the radio station of Lahd's militia, said Ms.Bishara worked at a health club supported by the general's wife,Minerva.   It said Mrs. Lahd had invited her to tea Monday along with CaesarSaqr, a militia spokesman, and Lahd's sons Rabih and Ron. When Lahdgot home at 8 p.m., it said, Ms. Bishara shot him twice.   The radio said Ms. Bishara was being interrogated byinvestigators for the militia in Marjayoun, the main city in thesecurity zone. Pro-communist pamphlets, leaflets and posters werefound at her house, the broadcast said.   On Sunday, Lahd's militiamen killed three guerrillas nearNaqoura, about two miles north of the Israeli border. Israel saidthe guerrillas were planning to attack a civilian target.</TEXT></DOC>
