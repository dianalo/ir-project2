Division had been the rule among the Communist, environmentalistand anti-NATO parties in the coalition. But when they stoppedfighting and ran on a single platform, the Green Left partiesdoubled their contingent of three seats in the 150-seat legislaturein Wednesday's vote.   The rise of the Green Left in the Netherlands comes after theGreens drew a surprising 6 percent of the vote in June elections forthe European Parliament. Greens have won significant parliamentaryrepresentation in countries such as West Germany and have madesteady electoral advances in Italy, where they hold key posts in anumber of municipal and regional governments.   According to analysts in the Netherlands, Green Left's win wasmostly at the expense of the opposition Labor Party, seen by manyradical left-wing voters as too middle-of-the-road.   Labor lost three of its 52 parliamentary seats in the electionWednesday.   Premier Ruud Lubbers' Christian Democrats kept their 54 seats andremained the largest single legislative faction.   Among establishment parties, ``Everybody has sort of moved towardthe center,'' said Ina Brouwer, leader of the Communist Party of theNetherlands.   In a pre-election interview, Ms. Brouwer said Labor's softeningof its once unconditional rejection of nuclear weapons was a majorfactor contributing to the Green Left's success.   In the early 1980s, Labor was active in a grass-roots campaignagainst the deployment of 48 U.S. cruise missiles on Dutch soil. Butin recent years, the party has been far less outspoken in itsopposition to the proposed modernization of NATO's short-rangenuclear systems, rejected outright by Green Left.   The alliance also has capitalized on renewed interest in theenvironment, spurred by the government's fall last May over anambitious anti-pollution plan.   Green Left's environmental platform includes slapping aprohibitively high tax on the sale of automobiles and otherpollution-causing industrial products.   The revenue of that so-called ``green tax'' has been estimated at$3 billion and would be used to stimulate production methods that donot harm the environment.   ``I don't see other parties putting that into their platform yetbecause they're serving two masters. One is the environment and theother is economic growth,'' said Ms. Brouwer at her penthouseapartment overlooking an Amsterdam canal.   The party also wants to drastically raise the incomes of thenation's 3 million recipients of subsistence-level social benefits,prompting criticism by Labor leader Wim Kok that Green Left wasbuilding ``castles in the air.''   On Thursday, the conservative newspaper De Telegraaf noted withrelief that Green Left had not gained the 10 parliamentary seatspredicted by some pre-ballot projections.   ``Green Left's ideas ... were so far beyond social reality thatthey couldn't be taken seriously,'' the paper said.   Apart from the Communists, the alliance includes the PacifistSocialist Party, a staunchly anti-military group that until recentlyopposed all forms of armed resistance.   Its remaining two members are the Evangelical People's Party andthe Radicals, left-wing groups that split off from Lubbers'Christian Democrats in the 1970s and '80s.   Disputes over leftist doctrine kept the four apart for decades,although they formed alliances in some local elections.   In the previous Parliament, the Radicals held two seats and thePacifist Socialists had one.   Under the influence of grass-roots movements like the campaignagainst the missiles, the four parties gradually grew closer, Ms.Brouwer said.   The 39-year-old lawyer lost her parliamentary seat in 1986 butwas returned in the Wednesday election.   In 1982, she led the moderate faction of her party in a disputewith orthodox Communists who saw her program of feminist-orientedreform as an insult to the Moscow-ordained party line.   The Soviet-oriented old guard formed its own splinter group.   ``Centrally organized socialism with a one-party system isbankrupt, that much is clear from events in Eastern Europe,'' Ms.Brouwer said.</TEXT></DOC>
