The National Association of Securities Dealers, whichhandles two-thirds of all arbitration filings, has launched apilot program that encourages investors and brokerage firmsto try the mediation route. Several stock exchanges and theAmerican Arbitration Association also are urging investors touse mediation.</LP><TEXT>   Mediation has long been used in labor and other disputes,but has been slow to catch on in the securities business.Unlike litigation or arbitration, there is no formal hearingor binding decision when a case goes to mediation. Instead,the parties voluntarily meet to try to hammer out asettlement.   &quot;It's a way to get people together early on in their case,cut costs and have a neutral party listen and evaluate bothsides,&quot; says Deborah Masucci, the NASD's director ofarbitration.   The typical result: quicker and less costly cases forinvestors and brokers. And mediation helps reduce thefattening caseload of arbitration cases involving thesecurities industry and unhappy investors. In the NASD pilotprogram, about 60% of the cases that went to mediation weresettled, compared with about a bit more than 50% inarbitration.   While most securities disputes are heard by a panel ofthree arbitrators who decide the case, mediation typically ishandled by an independent attorney in an informal series ofmeetings. The mediator's job is to work with the parties toanalyze the case and settle it. Most securities mediationcases are heard before the American Arbitration Associationor U.S. Arbitration and Mediation Inc.   &quot;A mediator's role, as opposed to that of arbitrators, isone of conciliation, not decision-making,&quot; says Richard P.Ryder, editor of the Securities Arbitration Commentator, aMaplewood, N.J., newsletter. &quot;He doesn't sit as a judge, butmore of a referee.&quot;   Securities specialists applaud the move toward mediation.They say the process helps investors and brokers analyzetheir disputes and find ways to reach a compromise. &quot;A lot ofthese cases just have to do with how much a broker is goingto pay to get rid of the claim,&quot; says Robert Coulson,president of the American Arbitration Association.   Investors typically sign an agreement when they open abrokerage account, binding them to accept arbitration ratherthan file a lawsuit if a dispute arises. While arbitration isless costly than litigation, the buildup in arbitration casesis leading securities firms to look to mediation as an evenless costly alternative.   But mediation is no panacea. Sometimes, investors orbrokers don't need or want it; they are able to reach asettlement amicably without mediation. More important, thefacts or circumstances of some cases lead the parties to wantto avoid any kind of compromise.   And some securities lawyers claim that investors lose outin mediation because they typically are giving up the chanceto get back all they claimed is owed them.   &quot;Most people go into arbitration with the idea that theywant to win it all or be prepared to lose it all,&quot; saysJeffrey L. Liddle, a New York lawyer who often handlesarbitration cases against brokerage firms.   The NASD's recent pilot program is far from a smashingsuccess. After randomly selecting 203 cases to refer tomediation, only in 36 cases did both parties agree to attemptmediation. Says the NASD's Ms. Masucci: &quot;The number of casesfunneled into mediation is smaller than we really expected.&quot;   Still, the mediation cases were closed out more quicklythan arbitration. The average mediated case took nine months,compared with nearly a year for arbitration, the NASD says.   And mediation in securities cases is picking up steam.Although statistics aren't available on the number ofsecurities disputes being mediated, &quot;we're seeing more of it,because it works,&quot; says the American ArbitrationAssociation's Mr. Coulson.   At least, the parties agreeing to mediation have nothingto lose. If they can't hammer out a settlement, they canalways go to arbitration.</TEXT></DOC>
