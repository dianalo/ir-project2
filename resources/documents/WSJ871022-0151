Government deregulation allows airlines, banks and others to raise prices and cut services to rural communities while the government is paying rural-based hospitals and physicians less for more services. Rural Medicare beneficiaries pay a greater percentage of the cost of their care while rural physicians and hospitals are reimbursed at a rate substantially less than that of urban providers.    The Health Care Financing Administration has been successful in its perpetuation of a bias against rural communities. HCFA routinely makes no mention of the local adjustments it makes to the publicized national payment rates; with these adjustments, actual urban rates are frequently 30% to 40% higher. HCFA is adept at hiding its own agenda inside a warren of complex reimbursement formulas under the guise of deregulation and promoting health-care competition.    Many rural and urban community hospitals and clinics compete head-to-head; by paying urban facilities a substantial premium per additional admission, HCFA is financing urban advertising, buying of &quot;outreach&quot; clinics, subsidizing of new physician income, underwriting of insurance premiums and other competitive practices used to capture larger shares of rural markets. Is the government saving costs, or rather steering federal dollars to a more powerful constituency?    Tim Size   Executive Director, Rural   Wisconsin Hospital Cooperative   Sauk City, Wis.   ---   Our members -- 450 small, rural telephone companies -- are seeing the first waves of a tide of global change, highlighted by the breakup of the ATandamp;T system in 1984 and coupled with the deregulatory ideology of regulators who trust the marketplace to take care of itself.    By and large, competition is good for the economy and good for the nation. But, as we have seen in other industries, it can often result in gross inequities. Too often rural Americans are expected to bear the brunt of such inequities.    Getting as many Americans as possible onto the telephone network has been a national goal since 1934. To date, the telephone industry has been fortunate to escape a fate similar to the large-scale termination of transportation and banking services, which has severely affected rural Americans. Regulators at the national and state levels should consider carefully whether their decisions will move us closer to the goal of &quot;universal service&quot; for all Americans, or whether such decisions ultimately will encourage people to drop off and thus destroy the national telephone network.    A system that asks rural Americans to pay more for less service, and where the benefits of modern telecommunications services are available only to those who choose to live in cities, will be neither economically efficient nor in the best interests of the nation.    Michael E. Brunner   Executive Vice President   National Telephone   Cooperative Association   Washington   ---   Though the Nebraska Panhandle has felt the effects of deregulation, we who live here wouldn't want anyone to think the high plains are becoming the Great American Desert. Some of our costs have gone up due to deregulation, but housing in particular still makes our area inexpensive to live in compared with popular urban areas, not to mention uncongested, pollution-free and scenic.    Though our air service was threatened, recent congressional actions to extend subsidies make its continuation for the next several years highly probable. Though bus service to some destinations has been discontinued or made more difficult, service to by far the most common destination, Denver, is better than in 1981 and this is the direct result of deregulation.    Deregulation allowed Denver Coach, which I own, to get operating authority and was, I believe, the very type of innovative business that deregulation was intended to promote. Deregulation may be getting condemned too soon and too monolithically in rural areas.    Coyd Walker   Scottsbluff, Neb.</TEXT></DOC>
