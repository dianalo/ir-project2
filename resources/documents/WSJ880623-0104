Apcar (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT PNW </CO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board is negotiating the acquisition of 64 troubled Texas thrifts by investors and other thrifts and expects to merge about one-third of that total by mid-August, a top official said.    The statement from Roger Martin, a Bank Board member, suggested that board effort to merge sick Texas thrifts is beginning to pick up momentum after five months of painfully slow progress. &quot;We're filling the pipeline,&quot; agreed a Bank Board staffer, who said the number of people seeking to acquire Texas savings and loan associations has surged in recent weeks.    So far this year, the board has merged 10 weak Texas thrifts of the 150 it plans to turn over to stronger institutions by year end. Some thrift industry officials have complained that the board needs to move faster to stem the growing losses of insolvent thrifts, mostly in Texas, which totaled $4.6 billion in the first quarter alone.    Mr. Martin said at a news conference that the agency hopes the 64 savings and loan associations will be consolidated into 16 recapitalized thrifts as part of the government's Southwest plan to recapitalize the ailing thrift industry in Texas and nearby states.    He predicted that between July 15 and about Aug. 20, the Bank Board will unveil &quot;four major deals involving 20 institutions.&quot; So far, 10 Texas Sandamp;Ls have been acquired in the Southwest plan, which envisions rescuing more than 150 institutions.    Mr. Martin's disclosure came as the Bank Board announced its first acquisition of a Texas thrift by a well-capitalized, out-of-state institution. MeraBank, Arizona's largest thrift with $6.6 billion in assets, agreed to buy three Texas Sandamp;Ls, two of which were announced yesterday.    MeraBank, a unit of Phoenix, Ariz.-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp., said it has long-term plans to diversify its portfolio and expand in Texas.    &quot;We believe Texas has bottomed out and is on the way back up,&quot; said Gene Rice, MeraBank's 58-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, who ropes steers as a hobby on the rodeo circuit.    The acquisition includes a $83.9 million, 10-year assistance package from the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp., which protects MeraBank from losses on bad loans and foreclosed real estate. MeraBank agreed to put up $8.8 million in new capital, share certain profits with the FSLIC and give the government a warrant for a 20% stake in its Texas operation.    &quot;It isn't a no lose situation,&quot; Mr. Rice said, &quot;but I don't have the risk of the bad loans,&quot; because of the guarantee. He said the government doesn't let acquirers conduct reviews of the troubled thrifts' books, so MeraBank had to trust the FSLIC's evaluation of the loan portfolio.    &quot;We bought this based on very little information,&quot; he said. Any profit on sales of foreclosed real estate that exceed 80% of book value would be shared, though the FSLIC initially would reap as much as 90% of the excess profit.    Mr. Rice said the Phoenix-based thrift's plan to acquire a third Texas Sandamp;L later this year would bring its purchases to about $1 billion in assets in addition to MeraBank's existing Texas branches in El Paso and Dallas. Over several years, MeraBank aims to &quot;be bigger in Texas than we are in Arizona,&quot; Mr. Rice said. He said it is also considering acquisitions in the Midwest.    MeraBank's acquisitions include First Financial -- A Savings Institution, an insolvent El Paso thrift with $330 million assets, and Brownfield Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, a Brownfield institution with $40.2 million in assets that was created after the 1985 failure of a predecessor institution. MeraBank plans to consolidate all of its Texas operations within six to nine months.    MeraBank plunged into Texas in 1982 when it purchased a troubled El Paso thrift. &quot;We turned it positive in 90 days,&quot; Mr. Rice said, by reducing the cost of funds and expenses. Much the same strategy will be used again, he said.    In Washington, meanwhile, the Bank Board's industry-advisory committee urged it to clamp a tighter lid on the growth of insolvent thrifts. The recommendation reflected continuing resentment among banks and savings institutions that some sick thrifts have expanded lending in a gamble to recoup their losses.    Some have obtained funds for such lending by offering high rates for deposits, which bids up rates that all other financial institutions must pay depositors.    The advisory group called for a ban on any growth in assets by thrifts that are insolvent under regulatory accounting rules. It also called for the Bank Board to force a 10% annual reduction in the assets of badly insolvent thrifts in which the Bank Board has installed its own managers.    Regulators said they have moved in that direction, but not that far. Darrel Dochow, executive director of the Bank Board's Office of Policy, Oversight and Supervision, said all institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements are barred from expanding faster than their deposits grow by accumulating interest. Controls on thrifts under the Bank Board's managers vary, he added.    ---   Robert E. Taylor in Washington contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
