At the scene of the crime these days, lasers search out otherwise-invisible fingerprints. Automated fingerprint systems pinpoint the culprit in record time. Genetic testing closes in on rapists, murderers and other criminals.    Constantly more sophisticated listening and tracking devices expand the range of surveillance. Artificial intelligence systems not only trace labyrinthine links among labor racketeers and organized crime groups but also suggest future lines of inquiry.    In short, high tech is revolutionizing the business of catching criminals.    &quot;Put all these changes together and they can make an enormous difference,&quot; says James Stewart, director of the National Institute of Justice, the Justice Department's crime research arm. &quot;These things will greatly reduce the opportunity to commit crime without detection.&quot;    The impact of high tech on law enforcement:   --An odd-jobs man killed a young New Jersey housewife and then burgled the house. His thumbprint on a glass in the kitchen sink wasn't considered enough evidence to bring charges; he had been raking leaves for the woman, and conceivably she could have given him a drink of water. Then laser illumination found on his clothing almost invisible fibers from the carpet in the master bedroom, where the assault had taken place. Confronted with this, he pleaded guilty. &quot;There's no question he would have gone free without the laser evidence,&quot; says Jeff Thompson, a forensic specialist in the Ocean County Sheriff's Office.    --A 57-year-old Tacoma, Wash., woman with Alzheimer's disease was raped by the man who regularly drove her to and from an adult day-care center. Because of her mental condition, prosecutors felt they couldn't base prosecution on her testimony. But so-called DNA fingerprinting -- comparing the driver's genetic pattern with that in semen recovered from the woman -- produced an identical match, and the man admitted the rape. &quot;DNA fingerprinting gives us a level of discrimination far above anything we've had available before,&quot; says Carole Jenny, a doctor working in Seattle's Harborview Sexual Assault Center, which is conducting a federally financed evaluation of the process.    --In Milwaukee, a detective investigating a residential burglary discovered a single fingerprint and ran it through the newly acquired automated fingerprint identification system, or AFIS. The system identified the culprit within minutes -- even before the detective's partner had finished searching the home for other clues. The criminal then owned up to that burglary and more than 20 others. &quot;Under the old manual search system, there wouldn't have been any point in even trying to match the print,&quot; says Inspector Joseph Slawinksi, head of Milwaukee's crime research. &quot;It would have taken years.&quot;    Not only does such evidence catch criminals who might otherwise go uncaught, but National Institute of Justice studies find it also increases the chances of conviction and long sentences. &quot;You give the DA a royal flush,&quot; says Sgt. Ken Moses of the San Francisco Police Department.    High tech is playing a role even after conviction. Breathalyzers wired to auto ignition systems keep convicted drunk drivers from starting their cars if they've been over-imbibing. Electronically controlled wrist or ankle cuffs and voice identification devices monitor the presence of offenders sentenced to house arrest. One new system even adds a breathalyzer test to the home arrest monitor.    Even as the new crime-fighting technology draws raves from most police, prosecutors, judges and corrections officials, it worries other people. Some fear a particular device may be employed before it's proven reliable. And civil libertarians worry about a too-broad expansion of state power, particularly in the use of artificial intelligence systems and electronic monitoring of people in home arrest.    Still others believe too much money is being spent on glamorous technology instead of mundane items, such as more beat cops, that might do more to prevent crime rather than apprehend the criminal after the fact.    Many law enforcement officials respond that catching and locking up more criminals prevents all the crime those criminals would otherwise commit. Sgt. Moses estimates that burglaries in the city dropped 28% in the first three years his department had automated fingerprint searching -- largely, he says, because the system helped put 2,000 San Francisco burglars in prison, unable to commit fresh burglaries.    Among law enforcement officials, there's widespread agreement that, so far, AFIS is the most useful leap forward. It &quot;is one thing that I see as an absolute breakthrough,&quot; says Carnegie Mellon University criminologist Alfred Blumstein. &quot;It will be pervasive in its effects.&quot;    In the automated system, &quot;reader&quot; machines electronically scan prints, locating as many as 100 key points -- so-called minutiae, where a whorl ends or forks -- for each finger. Later, when police seek to identify latent prints from a crime scene, a computer-programmed &quot;matcher&quot; searches the data base at hundreds or even thousands of prints a second. Using a complex scoring system for each point of similarity, it kicks out the 10 or 20 closest matches. A human operator does the final comparison to see if AFIS has made a &quot;hit.&quot;    By the end of this year, almost half the states and over a score of large counties and cities will have an AFIS system. California has nearly six million prints in its AFIS files, and by the end of the year hopes that all major cities and counties will be able to search the state's files directly from their own terminals. In addition, regional networks linking several compatible state systems are in the planning stage.    The FBI's huge system -- more than 19.5 million prints automated -- isn't compatible with state and local systems, but the agency constantly is scanning and searching to identify prints mailed in by local police departments seeking help.    Another type of criminal identification -- so-called DNA fingerprinting -- is still in the early stages of use but promises to be equally important. Newly developed biotechnological &quot;probes&quot; can take a sample of cellular material, put it through a complicated laboratory process and eventually produce a small piece of film-looking somewhat like the bar codes on grocery items -- showing the sequence of DNA molecules.    Since every person except an identical twin has a unique genetic pattern, the process can identify with absolute certainty. The evidence may be a drop of blood left on a broken windowpane by a burglar, the semen on a vaginal swab from a rape victim, the skin tissue found under the nails of a murdered man.    &quot;We can now do it with a single hair root,&quot; says John Huss, a vice president of Cellmark Diagnostics, a subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries doing DNA fingerprinting in the U.S. &quot;It's a yes or no identification -- there are no maybes.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
