The problems were classified as integrationof three phases to one, compounding, and rationalization of insulation.Regarding the integration of three phases, introduction of photo-converterand transformer, application of high performance arrester, and decreasingthe tank diameter, were emphasized. Regarding the compounding, the degreeof it should be decided with considering the user's usage and maintenance.Regarding the rationalization of insulation, importance of molding technologyof insulating material and applying technique of spacer, were explained.Improvements under progress were introduced.
