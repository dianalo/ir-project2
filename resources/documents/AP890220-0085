The protest campaign has been provoked by two relateddevelopments: the reintroduction of hardline apartheid measures byright-wing town councilors and the alleged beatings by whitevigilantes of blacks seen in the town after dark.   Local affiliates of the Congress of South African Trade Unions,the country's main black labor federation, said the protests wereplanned at a community meeting Saturday in Khutsong, a blacktownship outside Carletonville.   Carletonville, 45 miles southwest of Johannesburg, was one ofseveral dozen towns where the extreme-right Conservative Party tookpower in local elections in October.   The town council subsequently voted to resegregate localfacilities that had been opened to all races and to build a fencearound the town hall to keep blacks off the lawn.   Last month, the council said it was studying the possibility of acurfew barring blacks from Carletonville at night, but no action hasbeen taken yet.   The trade union statement said the boycott, expected to beginnext week, was decided on ``to protest the ultra-racist policies ofthe town council.''   ``We resolve to defy aparthied laws imposed on us, to defendourselves against assaults by white conservatives in the town and onthe mines, to withdraw our buying power from white-owned businesses,big and small,'' said a resolution adopted at the community meeting.   Tentative plans were made at the meeting for a sit-in at the mainpark in Carletonville, where ``whites-only'' signs recently wereerected.   The union statement said black community leaders directed specialcriticism at the Anglo American Corp., the country's largest miningconglomerate, for allegedly continuing to deal with ``apartheid towncouncils.''   A black consumer boycott has been under way since beforeChristmas in the industrial town of Boksburg, where theConservative-controlled council has resegregated parks and otherfacilities. The National Party government of President P.W. Bothahas made no move to halt the boycott even though state-of-emergencyregulations prohibit the organization of such protests.   The government, which has condemned the Conservative Party'sresegregation campaign, has been accused of hypocrisy because it hasmade no move to repeal the law that allows blacks to be barred fromlocal facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
