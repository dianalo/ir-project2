Iacobellis president of a newly formed Aerospace Operations unit.    The unit comprises two former divisions: North American Aircraft, maker of the B-1B bomber, and North American Space Operations, prime contractor for the space shuttle. The reorganization was announced yesterday as Rockwell brought off the assembly line the last of the 100 B-1B aircraft it produced under an Air Force contract.    Mr. Iacobellis, 58 years old, has been president of North American Aircraft since 1984. Previously he was vice president of advanced programs at the Rocketdyne division, maker of the space shuttle main engine. He also is a corporate vice president of the parent.    Rockwell also appointed George W. Jeffs, 62, executive vice president of the parent corporation, a newly created position. Mr. Jeffs will oversee various divisions, including strategic defense, research and engineering, and the office of safety. He will report directly to Rockwell's president, Donald R. Beall. Previously, Mr. Jeffs was president of North American Space Operations since 1976 and a vice president of the parent company.    Separately, Rockwell said James A. McDivitt, formerly executive vice president for electronics operations, was named senior vice president, government operations. Mr. McDivitt succeeds Bastian &quot;Buz&quot; Hello, who is retiring. </TEXT></DOC>
