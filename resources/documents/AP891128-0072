Meanwhile, in Budapest, Hungary, the defense ministers of theseven Warsaw Pact nations began a three-day meeting to discussmilitary policies in light of improved East-West relations and thepolitical upheaval in the East bloc.   Hungarian Defense Minister Ferenc Kapati said at the openingsession that the ministers would ``put forward and discuss fiveimportant and topical issues that serve the modernization of thejoint armed forces and their defensive doctrine,'' the state MTInews agency reported. Further details were not immediately provided.   Defense ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationeagerly awaited Cheney's briefing at the start of their two-daymeeting.   Reports of the spending cuts have raised concern about whetherthe United States intends to pull out some of its more than 300,000troops in Europe before an agreement is reached on reducingconventional arms on the continent.   Talks are being held in Vienna and an accord is expected nextyear.   But German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said of U.S.proposals, ``We are talking about plans for the mid-1990s.''   Officials did not immediately provide details of Cheney'sremarks. He was expected to try to ease any fears about the U.S.commitment to NATO in the face of the momentous political andsocial changes in Eastern Europe.   Cheney, who stopped in the Netherlands on his way to Belgium,promised no troops would be pulled out of Europe without anEast-West agreement on conventional arms reductions, the Dutchgovernment said in The Hague.   Norwegian Gen. Vigleik Eide, chairman of NATO's panel of topmilitary commanders, said the Soviet Union and its allies remainmilitarily powerful.   ``The Berlin Wall ... has not much to do with military realitiesand does not change the military forces,'' he said. He wasreferring to East Germany's decision to let its citizens travelfreely and the opening of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9.   The NATO defense ministers' talks are the first in a series ofhigh-level discussions that will be held in the coming weeks atalliance headquarters.
