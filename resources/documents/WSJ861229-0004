The U.S. currency fell as low as 1.9550 marks in Asia Friday, in contrast to its previous 1986 low of 1.9580 marks. It rebounded to 1.9600 marks by late New York trading, although that was down from 1.9655 marks in New York Wednesday. All major markets except Tokyo were closed Thursday, Christmas Day.    The dollar also fell to 159.85 yen Friday from 161.25 yen Wednesday, and to 1.6390 Swiss francs from 1.6417 francs. But it rose to 6.4775 French francs from 6.4705 francs.    The British pound eased to $1.4573 from $1.4617 Wednesday.    Sentiment remains &quot;overwhelmingly bearish&quot; for the dollar, a New York trader said, citing sluggish economic growth, the stubbornly wide U.S. trade deficit and the lingering effects of the controversial U.S. arms sales to Iran.    &quot;It's just a matter of time for the dollar to go lower,&quot; said Peter Dembinski, a trader at Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co. in New York. The &quot;huge&quot; U.S. trade gap and the &quot;scandal in Washington that looks like it's not going to go away&quot; make a 1.80-mark level for the dollar likely as 1987 trading gets under way, he said.    The expectation that European central banks will intervene to support the dollar, as they have done in recent months, has become &quot;a distant memory&quot; that has lost much of its impact on the market, Mr. Dembinski said.    Bob Hatcher, a dealer at Barclays Bank PLC in New York, noted that the U.S. currency has fallen below what many traders had considered firm support points in the past week.    While some of the decline can be attributed to the thin holiday trading, which has magnified dollar sales, the fall also &quot;confirms the feeling that the (U.S.) economy is going into the tank, and makes it comfortable to sell dollars at these levels,&quot; he said.    Mr. Hatcher also said that traders are talking about the dollar's testing the 1.80-mark level. He declined to estimate when the dollar might touch bottom.    ---                        CURRENCY RATES                           New York    Home Mkt.

They added that the size of the intervention was smallin view of the thinness of the market.   At the official fixing in Paris, the mark was pegged at3.3300 francs, up sharply from 3.2883 francs Tuesday. Therewas no official fixing Wednesday or Thursday. Friday's levelwas the highest since the European Monetary Systemrealignment in April and took the mark close to 3.3303francs, the highest rate permitted by the EMS.   The mark has been rising steadily against the francrecently, partly reflecting a widening differential betweenFrench and German interest rates and partly because ofconcern over a French rail strike.</TEXT></DOC>
