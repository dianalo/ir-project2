Richard Stallings brought upFebruary's &quot;vote of conscience,&quot; his choice for sanctionsover war in the Gulf. With this tally, he and a sizablecongressional minority were thought to have made themselvesthe biggest bunch of American casualties of the war.   But when Mr. Stallings, who is seeking to move up to theSenate next year, raised the subject, he got the mostspirited applause of the afternoon. Granted, the few dozen inattendance were mainly party faithful, but if this state isany indicator, the issue may not be the cruise missileRepublicans were counting on.</LP><TEXT>   GOP Sen. Steve Symms had raised the Gulf vote against Mr.Stallings before deciding last month not to seek a thirdterm. A lack of response figured in the pullout, the Democratsurmised. (Mr. Symms, in his withdrawal statement, said hethought he could beat &quot;the left-leaning&quot; Mr. Stallings, butwanted &quot;liberty&quot; for himself after nearly 20 years inCongress.)   Should they lose the Symms seat, the Republicans canexpect to do little about their current 57-43 disadvantage inthe Senate, even if George Bush runs strongly next year.Several of their incumbents are vulnerable.   Idaho might be only an anomaly if it ignores Iraq. It was,of course, the state that sent Republican isolationistWilliam Borah to the Senate six times before World War II.Mr. Stallings said his mail was running better than 3-to-1against sending in troops before the pivotal vote. Likewise,he was willing to oppose Contra aid. Mr. Stallings identifieswith Jimmy Carter's foreign-policy themes, and expressesfondness for Frank Church, the prominent liberal Sen. Symmsousted in 1980. According to ratings compiled by thepro-market Competitive Enterprise Institute, Mr. Stallings isto the right of his party's caucus and just to the left ofthe House mean.   Insularity in Idaho extends beyond foreign policy:Generally, it has been a rare conservative stronghold in theNorthwest. However, that is starting to change. Although theGOP's Larry Craig won an open Senate seat in 1990, his Houseseat fell to a Democrat for the first time in 26 years.Republicans were routed in the gubernatorial race and lostcontrol of the state Senate.   Six years earlier, Mr. Stallings had beaten GOP Rep.George Hansen. Messrs. Hansen and Symms, in somewhatdifferent fashion, represented a kind of cowboy conservatism:maverick, even libertarian, in many respects but hard rightotherwise and kind to commercial resource interests that reapimplicit public subsidies.   Mr. Stallings knows how to play the giveaway game forfarmers and ranchers, but he shades toward environmentalistson water and wilderness questions. And those &quot;quality oflife&quot; issues are fueling the Democrats' drive in Idaho.   &quot;The change {in attitudes} that's taken place in the lastdecade is just phenomenal,&quot; Mr. Stallings remarked in aninterview at the Sun Valley Lodge, where he was resting upbetween campaign stops. The shift toward resourcepreservation is a function not only of the arrival ofnewcomers who seek the state's scenic and outdoor pleasures,but of old-timers who are doing well enough (personal incomegrew nicely here in the 1980s) to get anxious as thepopulation grows.   &quot;People are not forced to live here for jobs, like in NewYork or LA,&quot; Mr. Stallings observed. &quot;They choose to livehere.&quot; And their surroundings come first.   A Green Party is petitioning for inclusion on stateballots. Mr. Stallings said he didn't think the drive wouldsucceed, but if it did it could draw critical votes away fromDemocrats in some legislative races. Party organizers havepromised not to cut into his totals, he said.   Nowhere is the new dynamic of Idaho more evident than inthe Wood River Valley, where Ketchum has become a hub ofsorts. The population is triple what it was when ErnestHemingway killed himself in this place he loved in 1961.Hiking, biking, skiing and skating trails abound. The areanow is one of the nation's hot spots for executives orfinanciers who enlarge vacation homes into year-round workingresidences with half a dozen phone lines for necessaryelectronic gear. They, too, want the picture window to remainjust that.   The valley also draws many artists -- galleries outnumberbars in Ketchum. Mr. Stallings, a Mormon, boasted of backingthe National Endowment for the Arts when conservatives triedto cut its funding over allegations of obscenity andsacrilege.   The Democrat tends to other pivotal constituencies. Hepushed limits on Japanese semiconductor chips, a big deal toIdaho-based Micron Technology (and the Simplot potato barons,big investors in Micron). Mr. Stallings said his committeeservice should get him the bulk of agricultural money in thecampaign; it usually goes to the GOP. And, of course, he willtap union PACs -- he opposed the state's &quot;right to work&quot; lawand is sufficiently friendly to Big Labor in Congress.   Mr. Symms also sought to use Mr. Stallings's vote for thecivil-rights &quot;quota&quot; bill against him. But that issue doesn'tcut deeply in Idaho, which but for many Hispanic farm workersis nearly all white.   A popular Republican opponent might check the Democrats'momentum. Boise Mayor Dirk Kempthorne has the capital andlargest city as a base. However, his support for what Mr.Stallings calls a new &quot;bomb factory&quot; at the Idaho NationalEngineering Laboratory could tie him to the tracks of theenvironmental express. As it is, the big nuclear facilityarouses fears of damage to an aquifer serving the southernpopulation centers of the state.   Taxes could be the wild card for 1992. A repeat effort toenact a 1% limit on property levies seems headed for a vote,and the Democrats are against it. If Mr. Kempthorne getsbehind it, he will alienate moderates who fear a loss ofmoney to schools, according to Mr. Stallings. Laggingscholastic performance is one thing Idahoans aren'tself-satisfied about.   Clearly the 1 Percent, as it's called, carries risks forthe GOP, but in the current climate it might be the bestgamble. The state press is generally hostile to the right,and joining an antitax crusade won't win Idaho Republicansgood notices. But it could be a way for them to tap intograssroots preservationism: in this case a desire forfinancial security in one's home -- even the kind with justone phone line.   ---   Mr. Ferguson is a Los Angeles-based member of theJournal's editorial board.</TEXT></DOC>
