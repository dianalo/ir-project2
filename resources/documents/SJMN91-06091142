Like othersbefore her, the woman said she was eager to put her offspring on an earlytrack to her alma mater.;    But when the officials asked for the age of thefuture applicant, the answer left them stunned. The child had not been bornyet -- but the woman was pregnant and wanted to plan ahead.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  UPSCALE PARENTS CLING TO IVY LEAGUE HOPES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Family  </MEMO><TEXT>     For parents and students weathering the college application season -- thisis the season of acceptance letters -- such foresight reflects a desperateeffort to gain an edge in the increasingly hardball admissions process.;   The pool of post-baby-boomer applicants is shrinking annually, making collegeadmittance statistically easier than in previous years. Even so, many newupscale parents are determined to fight for their young to have an eliteeducation.;    The building process;  &quot;It's a sign of the times,&quot; says MauriceSalter, former head of the University of California, Irvine grants program,who works as a private counselor for college-bound students in Los Angeles.;   Business people understand that they do not develop the qualities connectedto success after they enter the workplace. &quot;There's a building process thatlaunches you into that success-oriented scenario,&quot; Salter says. &quot;That's thebig change in this generation of parents.&quot;;    Granted, not all parents pushtheir children to excel at all costs. But for many ultra-achiever parentsurging their offspring into upper-echelon institutions, the choice is largelya matter of prestige.;    &quot;They'd give their right arms to get their childreninto one of a dozen of the big-name schools,&quot; Fred Hargadon, PrincetonUniversity's admissions dean, says of the top competitive crust.;    AddsSalter: &quot;I've seen friends betray friends. The deal is the deal, and everybodywants to make a better deal than the next person made.&quot;;    Hargadon, whoheaded Stanford University's undergraduate admissions for 15 years, saysparents sometimes have appeared in his office with tattered copies of U.S.News andamp; World Report, which annually ranks the country's colleges anduniversities. They follow the ratings, he says, &quot;for the same reason that theybuy BMWs and live at a particular address.&quot;;    &quot;We're talking about thecocktail-party circuit,&quot; says Katherine Kendall, a private student counselorin Beverly Hills. &quot;A lot of parents are concerned that their children apply toschools that are prestigious enough for them to talk about.&quot;;    Moreover,&quot;lots of people are bound and determined to buy their way into these big-nameinstitutions,&quot; Kendall says, adding that some of her power-playing clientsoffer large sums of money to school scholarship funds and donations ofuniversity facilities.;    Aided by their elders, some ambitious students havecaught on to the trick of distinguishing themselves from the pack. At times,they have dreamed up wildly unorthodox ploys:;    (box) Leaving no stoneunturned in his application proceedings, one aspiring Harvard man sent in aload of cardboard cartons filled with all of his corrected papers fromkindergarten through high school.;    (box) In an attempt to woo Stanford'sadmissions committee, an artistic applicant sent committee members a6-by-8-foot group portrait painted in oils.;    (box) Printers' offspring havesubmitted mock-ups of Time magazine, featuring their pictures on the cover andarticles reporting on their accomplishments.;    (box) Would-be freshmen fromNapa and Sonoma valleys have regaled admissions officers with cases of wine.Youths from the Midwest have made earnest petitions with ears of corn.;    Inextreme cases, the children are given little or no choice in the schools theyapply to.;    In one vignette that seemed to step from the pages of the NewYorker, Hargadon recently overheard one applicant's mother asking another inthe waiting room, &quot;Was Princeton your first choice?&quot;;    And a few aspirants,he adds, have slipped notes into their applications that plead &quot;I really don'twant to come to Princeton.&quot;;    But when it comes to advertising their meansof advancement, both students and their elders are uncannily closemouthed.;   &quot;I work in anonymity,&quot; Salter says. &quot;Clients often don't tell the schools theyare working with me. And they don't boast about it at cocktail parties.&quot;;   On the student level, Debbie Duenes, who graduates this year from an advancedacademic program at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, concedes:;    &quot;Thecollege application process was really competitive. No one would tell anybodywhat they were writing their essays.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ELIZABETH VENANT, Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910331  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5L  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  741  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday March 31, 199100091142,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
