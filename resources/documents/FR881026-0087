D-7494 and D-7495]</ITAG>Proposed ExemptionThe Department is considering granting an exemption under the authorityof section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and inaccordance with the procedures set forth in ERISA Procedure 75-1 (40 FR18471, April 28, 1975). If the exemption is granted the restrictions ofsections 406 and 407(a) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from theapplication of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A)through (F) of the Code shall not apply to the acquisition or sale by thePlans of shares of certain open-end investment companies registered underthe Investment Company Act of 1940 (the AMA Mutual Funds) managed by AMAAdvisers, Inc. (AMA Advisers), an affiliate of the American Medical Association(AMA), provided that the following conditions are met:(a) The Plans do not pay any investment management, investment advisoryor similar fee to AMA Advisers or any affiliated person. This conditiondoes not preclude the payment of investment advisory fees by the AMA MutualFunds to AMA Advisers under the terms of an investment advisory agreementadopted in accordance with section 15 of the Investment Company Act of1940.(b) The Plans do not pay a redemption fee in connection with the sale bythe Plans to the AMA Mutual Funds of such shares unless (1) the redemptionfee is paid only to the applicable AMA Mutual Fund, and (2) the existenceof the redemption fee is disclosed in the AMA Mutual Fund prospectus ineffect both at the time of the acquisition of the shares and at the timeof the sale.(c) The Plans do not pay a sales commission in connection with the acquisitionor sale of the shares of the AMA Mutual Funds.(d) All other dealings between the Plans and the AMA Mutual Funds, AMAAdvisers, or any affiliated person, are on a basis no less favorable tothe Plans than such dealings are with other shareholders of the AMA MutualFunds.PreambleOn April 8, 1977, the Department published a class exemption, ProhibitedTransaction Exemption 77-3 (PTE 77-3, 42 FR 18734) which permits the acquisitionor sale of shares of an open-end investment company registered under theInvestment Company Act of 1940 by an employee benefit plan covering onlyemployees of such investment company, employees of such investment adviseror principal underwriter for the investment company, or employees of anyaffiliated person (as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Investment CompanyAct of 1940).The applicant represents that PTE 77-3 would allow the Plans to purchaseand sell shares of the AMA Mutual Funds if the Plans covered only employeesof the AMA Advisers and its affiliates. However, the Plans do not comewithin the terms of PTE 77-3 because there are four organizations (theOrganizations) that are not affiliated persons of AMA Advisers, as definedin section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which have employeesthat are covered by the Plans. The Organizations share common objectivesand activities with the AMA and receive financial support from the AMA.Thus, the Organizations are closely associated with the AMA. Accordingly,because the proposed transactions with the AMA Mutual Funds appear to parallelthose transactions contemplated by PTE 77-3, but for the fact that thereare employees of non-affiliated organizations covered by the Plans, theDepartment has determined that relief comparable to that afforded by PTE77-3 may be appropriate.Summary of Facts and Representations1. The Pension Plan is a defined benefit pension plan which, as of January1, 1988, had 945 participants and total assets of approximately $44,201,000.The Savings Plan is a profit-sharing plan with a cash or deferred compensationarrangement as described in section 401(k) of the Code, which had 897 participantsand total assets of approximately $5,212,000, as of January 1, 1988. Thetrustees of the Plans (the Trustees) are the members of the Executive Committeeof the AMA Board of Trustees.2. The assets of the Pension Plan are currently managed by OppenheimerCapital Corporation (Oppenheimer), an unrelated party, pursuant to a contractbetween Oppenheimer and the Trustees. The Savings Plan allows amounts contributedby participants to be invested, at the participant's election, in one ormore of four investment funds_the Liquidity Fund, the Fixed Income Fund,the Equity Index Fund, and the Managed Equity Fund (together, the ExistingFunds). The Liquidity Fund is invested in short-term, fixed income securities.The Managed Equity Fund is invested in a stock portfolio of large capitalizationcompanies with stable earnings records. Both the Liquidity Fund and theManaged Equity Fund are managed by Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer also investsassets of the Pension Plan in the Managed Equity Fund to provide a largerpool of assets for investment and greater opportunities for diversification.Assets of the Fixed Income Fund are currently invested in the InvestmentGrade Bond Portfolio of the Vanguard Income Securities Fund, which is aregistered, open-end investment company. The Equity Index Fund, which providesfor investment in a stock portfolio that is representative of the companiescomprising the Standard andamp; Poors 500 Stock Index, is currently investedin the Vanguard Index Trust, which is also a registered, open-end investmentcompany.3. The AMA is an Illinois not-for-profit corporation which promotes theinterests of the medical profession. The AMA has allowed the Plans to beadopted by the Organizations. The Organizations are the American MedicalAssociation Auxiliary (the Auxiliary), the American Association of SeniorPhysicians (the AASP), the American Association of Medical Society Executives(the AAMSE), and the American Board of Medical Specialties (the ABMS).The applicant states that the reason the Organizations were allowed toadopt the Plans was to enable the Organizations to provide a better retirementplan for their employees than they otherwise could have provided on theirown. In addition, because of the relationship between the AMA and the Organizations,some employees work for more than one of the Organizations during the courseof their career. Therefore, the applicant states that having a single planfor all the Organizations prevents the employees from losing some of theirretirement benefits due to changing employers. The Auxiliary is an Illinois not-for-profit corporation whose membershipis open to spouses of members of the AMA. Its major purposes include supportof AMA programs and fundraising for the AMA Education and Research Foundation,a charitable foundation. The AMA provides the Auxiliary with office spacein the AMA headquarters building in Chicago, Illinois, without charge.Over the past ten years, the Auxiliary has hired at least five employeeswho had previously been employed by the AMA. The AASP is an Illinois not-for-profit corporation which was formed in1975 to assist physicians in preparing for retirement. The AMA providedgrants totaling approximately $45,000 to help establish the AASP and continuesto provide it with office space without charge. Over the past three years,the AASP has hired at least two employees who had previously been employedby the AMA. The AAMSE is a Missouri not-for-profit corporation which was formed toprovide educational and other services designed to advance the professionof medical society management. Since 1977, the AAMSE's officers have beenin Chicago, Illinois, in space provided without charge by the AMA. Overthe past ten years, AAMSE has hired at least two employees who had previouslybeen employed by the AMA. The AAMSE currently has 984 members, 173 of whichare AMA employees whose dues are paid by the AMA. Since 1977, the AMA hasprovided grants which provide a significant portion of the AAMSE budget.The AAMSE Budget for the current fiscal year totals $305,000, of which$115,000 is provided by the AMA. The ABMS is an Illinois not-for-profit corporation whose regular membershipconsists of 23 medical specialty boards which certify physicians as specialistsin various areas of medical practice. The purpose of the ABMS is the improvementof medical care through the setting of professional standards and surveillanceof medical qualifications. Its most important specific activity is theapproval of new medical specialty boards, which is a joint activity ofthe ABMS and the AMA Council on Medical Education. The ABMS and AMA arealso among the parent organizations of the Accreditation Council for GraduateMedical education, which accredits medical residency programs; the AccreditationCouncil for Continuing Medical Education, which accredits providers ofcontinuing medical education programs; and the Council for Medical Affairs,which serves as a forum for its member organizations to discuss issuesrelevant to medical education. Thus, although the AMA is not a member ofthe ABMS, the two organizations have similar purposes and are involvedin a number of the same educational and accreditation activities. Overthe past ten years, the ABMS has hired at least three employees, includingtwo former Executive Vice Presidents, who had previously been employedby the AMA. However, the Auxiliary, the AASP, the AAMSE and the ABMS are not affiliatesof the AMA or AMA Advisers, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the InvestmentCompany Act of 1940. The applicant represents that since section 2(a)(3)defines affiliation between organizations in terms of the ownership ofvoting stock or the organization being under common control, the definitionis not applicable to relationships between non-stock corporations, suchas the AMA and the Organizations. Thus, the Organizations are not consideredto be ``affiliates'' of the AMA, even though the Organizations have objectiveswhich further the purposes of the AMA, are involved in a number of jointactivities with the AMA, and often share office space with, and receivefinancial support from, the AMA. 4. AMA Advisers is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American medical InvestmentCompany, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMA Services, Inc., a wholly-ownedsubsidiary of the AMA. AMA Advisers is a registered investment adviserunder the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and serves as the investmentadviser for the AMA Mutual Funds_the AMA Growth Fund, Inc., the AMA IncomeFund, Inc., the AMA Money Fund, Inc., the Medical Technology Fund, Inc.,and the Emerging Medical Technology Fund Inc. The AMA Mutual Funds areall open-end mutual funds, registered under the Investment Company Actof 1940, which have a total of ten investment portfolios. 5. The applicant states that the use of the AMA Mutual Funds would be inthe best interests of the Plans and their participants and beneficiaries.First, the applicant represents that the AMA Mutual Funds would make availablea wider range of investment alternatives for the Plans. In particular,the Savings Plan's participants would have a wider range of investmentoptions available to them, which would allow them to choose a combinationof investment funds that meets their specific investment objectives. Inaddition, the use of the AMA Mutual Funds would allow the assets of thePlans to be invested as part of a larger pool of capital, which would enhancethe ability of the Plans to diversify their investments and provide additionalprotection against unexpected losses.Second, the applicant represents that the participants of the Plans wouldbe provided with more information about the available investment optionswith respect to the AMA Mutual Funds. In this regard, the applicant notesthat two of the four Existing Funds are maintained solely for the SavingsPlan and are exempt from registration under Federal securities laws. Thus,the applicant states that while participants are provided with generalinformation regarding the investment objectives and management of theseparticular Existing Funds, the information available is not as extensiveas that contained in an AMA Mutual Fund prospectus, or as in the quarterlyand annual reports and other shareholder communications for the AMA MutualFunds. Finally, the applicant represents that the use of the AMA Mutal Funds wouldprovide the participants of the Savings Plan with more freguent opportunitiesto change investment elections. The Saving Plan currently allows participantsto change their investment elections as of the beginning of each calendarquarter. The applicant believes that more frequent participant electionswould be desirable, but are not feasible with the Savings Plan's currentaccounting and participant recordkeeping systems. The applicant statesthat the accounting and recordkeeping systems maintained for AMA MutualFunds would make more frequent investment elections possible. Such investmentelections would also benefit investments made by the Pension Plan. 6. The applicant proposes that the Plans be allowed to acquire or sellshares of the AMA Mutual Funds, in accordance with the conditions set forthin paragraphs (a)-(d) of PTE 77-3 which are, for all intents and purposes,indentical to those conditions included in this proposed exemption. TheTrustees represent that the proposed transactions will be monitored toensure that these conditions are met. AMA Advisers receives an investmentmanagement fee from each of the AMA Mutual Funds, as described in the appropriateprospectus for each Fund. In addition, the AMA Mutual Funds also pay certaindistribution expenses pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment CompanyAct of 1940 \1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The proposed relief contained herein is limnited to thepurchase and sale by the Plans of shares of the AMA Mutual Funds. In thisregard, no relief has been requested or provided in connection with thepayment of distribution expenses pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the InvestmentCompany Act of 1940.The applicant states that AMA Advisers would serve as an investment advisorto the Pension Plan without charge. However, AMA Advisers will not be aninvestment advisor for the Savings Plan. The applicant states further thatif the proposed exemption is granted, Oppenheimer will no longer be aninvestment manager for the Plans and that the Plans' interests in the ExistingFunds will be liquidated. 7. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactionswill satisfy the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because:(a) The acquisition and sale of shares of the AMA Mutual Funds parallelthose transactions contemplated by PTE 77-33; (b) the Plans will pay nosales commissions or redemption fees to AMA Advisers with respect to theinvestments in the AMA Mutual Funds; (c) the Plans will be provided withmore investment options and full disclosure of all relevant facts concerningthe investments; and (d) the Pension Plan will not pay any fee to AMA Advisorsas a result of AMA Advisors duties as an investment adviser for the PensionPlan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>For Further Information Contact:</T2> Mr. E.F.

(the Employer),the Plan sponsor and a party in interest with respect to the Plan, of 158rare coins (the Coins) for a sales price of $701,000; provided the termsand conditions of the Sale are at least as favorable to the Plan as thoseobtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party.Summary of Facts and Representations1. The Plan is a defined contribution plan with 1,300 participants andtotal assets of $9,204,751 as of December 31, 1987. The Employer is engagedin the newspaper business and owns and operates approximately sixty dailyand weekly newspapers nation-wide. The trustee of the Plan is Crestar Bank,N.A., (the Trustee). The Investment Committee (the Committee) is appointedby the Employer and is empowered under the Plan documents to direct theTrustee's investments. The Plan documents also provide for participant-directedinvestments. However, the applicant represents that there are no individuallydirected accounts in the Plan.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In this regard, the Department notes that section 408(m)of the Code provides that the acquisition after December 31, 1981, by anindividually directed account under a plan described in Code section 401(a)of a collectible (including any coin) shall be treated as a distributionfrom the account in an amount equal to the cost to the account of the collectible.2. In 1981, the Committee, then consisting of Dennis S. Rooker, John J.Badoud, Jr. and Thomas E. Worrell, Jr., decided to invest in the Coins.The Committee purchased the Coins between August, 1981 and March, 1986for a total purchase price of $432,210 from Tallarico Rare Coins, Inc.(TRC), an unrelated party. The applicant represents that TRC and ThomasV. Tallarico of TRC issued a certificate of guarantee for each coin purchasedby the Plan which stated that the sellers would repurchase any of the Coinsat any time for an amount not less than the Plan's cost plus 50% of anyincrease in value over cost as determined by appraisal. The applicant furtherrepresents that Mr. Tallarico performed an appraisal of the Coins on atleast an annual basis. On March 25, 1987, Mr. Tallarico appraised the Coins'December 31,1986 value at $701,000 (the 1986 Appraisal). The Coins represented7.6% of the Plan's assets as of December 31, 19878. The Committee discovered, after the 1986 Appraisal, that Mr. Tallaricoand TRC were faced with severe financial trouble. Both had defaulted ona number of debts and were named as defendants in a fraud action broughtby other customers. As a consequence of these discoveries, the Committeesought another appraisal of the Coins.A subsequent appraisal of the Coins was perfomred on February 5, 1988 bya qualified independent appraiser, Edward Milas. Mr. Milas is Presidentof Rare Coin Company of America and a past President of the ProfessionalNumismatic Guild with more than 25 years professional experience. Mr. Milasdetermined the fair market value of the Coins to be $250,385. Mr. Milas'appraisal reflects a $450,615 loss to the Plan from the 1986 Appraisalvalue of the Coins, as well as a $181,825 loss from the Plan's purchaseprice.3. As a result of the decrease in the Coin's value, the Plan and its participantsand beneficiaries face severe difficulties. The Plan has suffered a substantialeconomic loss up to approximately 5% of the value of its assets due tothe decrease in the Coins' value. In addition, Plan participant statementsfor the year ended February 28, 1987 were computed on the basis of theCoins' 1986 Valuation of $701,000. Consequently, Plan participant withdrawalswere computed and disbursed on the same erroneous basis.4. In order to avoid further economic loss and hardship to the Plan andto benefits participants and beneficiaries, the Employer now seeks an exemptionto permit the cash Sale of the Coins by the Plan to the Employer for $701,000.The applicant represents that the subject exemption would benefit the Plan'sparticipants because the Plan would be placed in a better position thanit would have been in if the Coins had never been acquired by the Plan.\3\<NOTE/> In addition, the applicant states that such a Sale will notexceed the requirements of section 415 of the Code and that the Plan willpay no fees or commissions in connection with the Sale.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Department notes that the fiduciary responsibilityprovisions of the Act apply to the acquisition, holding and sale of theCoins. Section 404(a)(1)(B) of the Act requires that a fiduciary dischargehis duties with respect to a plan solely in the interests of the participantsand beneficiaries and with the care, skill, prudence, and dilligence underthe circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacityand familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterpriseof a like charcter and with like aims.<ITAG tagnum="28">Accordingly, the plan fiduciary must act prudently with respect tothe decision to enter into an investment as well as to the negotiationof the specific terms under which the investment will be held. The Departmentfurther emphasizes that it expects a plan fiduciary, prior to enteringinto an investment, to understand fully the nature of the investment andthe risks associated with the manner of investment. In addition, such planfiduciary must be capable of periodically monitoring the investment. Thus,in considering whether to enter into an investement, a fiduciary shouldtake into account its ability to provide adequate oversight of the investment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The Department also notes that, under section 405(a) of the Act, anyplan fiduciary will have co-fiduciary liability for any breach of fiduciaryresponsibility of another plan fiduciary: (1) If he knowingly participatesin or conceals such breach; (2) if by his failure to comply with section404(a)(1), he enables another fiduciary to commit such a breach; or (3)if he has knowledge of the breach of another fiduciary and he fails tomake a reasonable effort to remedy the breach.</ITAG>5. In summary, the applicant represents that the transaction meets thestatutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) The Sale willbe a one-time transaction consummated for cash; (b) the fair market valueof the Coins has been determined by a qualified independent appraiser;(c) the Plan will receive in excess of the fair market value of the Coins;(d) the Plan will dispose of assets which have declined in value; and (e)the Plan will pay no fees or commissions in connection with the Sale.Tax Consequences of TransactionThe Department of the Treasury has determined that if a transaction betweena qualified employee benefit plan and its sponsoring employer (or affiliatethereof) results in the plan either paying less than or receiving morethan fair market value such excess may be considered to be a contributionby the sponsoring employer to the plan and therefore must be examined underapplicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, including sections401(a)(4), 404 and 415.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>For Further Information Contact</T2>: Mrs. Betsy Scott of the Department,telephone (202) 523-8194.

Summary of Facts and Representations (1) The Plan is a profit sharing plan for salaried employees with 107 participantsand total assets of $7,515,111, as of December 31, 1987. The Plan originatedin 1960 and on July 1, 1987, was reinstated in the form of a Wells FargoBank, N.A. prototype profit sharing plan with features authorizing theEmployer to make deferred-pay contributions based upon such percentageof the participants' covered compensation as the Employer may determine.Participants may elect to have all or a portion of the assets in theirrespective accounts invested in any or all of three different funds. Thethree funds are managed by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which is also the trusteeof the Plan. One of the investments for the Plan is the Leasehold, whichis invested in one of the three funds designated as the Fixed Income Fund.(2) the Employer is a California corporation headquartered in San Franciscoand engaged in civil engineering design, consulting, and planning. In theyear 1968 the Employer acquired a leasehold interest in underlying ground,consisting of 22,428 square feet, on which was constructed a 94-unit leaseholdcondominium and which is located at 250 Ohua Avenue, Waikiki, Honolulu,Oahu, Hawaii. The suit underlying the condominium project is owned by theEstate of Valentine Spitzer Lewis (Helen M. Lewis and Rhoda V. Lewis, Executrices).This acquisition in 1968 constitutes the Leasehold which provides for groundrents until the year 2044. In 1973, the Employer assigned its interestsin the Leasehold to the Plan as a funding contribution. The assignmentprovides that the Plan is responsible for collecting ground rents fromthe condominium owners and their respective portion of the expenses incurredfrom taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, and utility charges on theproperty and paying to the landowner/lessor a ground rent plus paying theexpenses incurred by the property. The difference between the ground rentscollected, less a four percent Hawaii State Gross Excise Tax, the groundrents paid to the landowner/lessor is the yield to the Plan from the Leasehold.Unitl 1999, the ground rents payable by the Plan to the landowner/lessorand the rents receivable by the Plan from the condominium owners are setpursuant to the 1968 lease. Beginnig in 1999, the rents for the final fourten-year periods and one five-year period are subject to adjustment inaccordance with mutual agreements or appraisals; however, in no event shallthe rents for any period be less than the rents for the immediately precedingperiod. Under the terms of the Leasehold to the Employer and its assignmentto the Plan, the Employer retained responsibility as lessee to the landowner/lessorin the event of default by the Plan as sublessee. (3) the Plan now proposes to sell the Leasehold to the Employer becauseit has been determined that problems with rent collections from the condominiumowners make the Leasehold undersirable an no longer an appropriate assetfor the Plan. The Plan intends to invest the proceeds from the Sale inthe other funds maintained by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Because of the difficultiesanticipated in finding a purchaser for the Leasehold, the Employer is willingto purchase the Leasehold from the Plan. The Sale is to be for cash inan amount not less than the greater of either the sum of $130,000 or thefair market value of the Leasehold on the date of the Sale as determinedby a qualified, independent appraiser. No fees, commissions, or other costsare to be incurred by the Plan from the Sale. The Leasehold was appraisedby a qualified, independent appraiser, Robert J. Vernon, MAI, CRE and Chairmanof John Child andamp; Company, Inc. of Honolulu, Hawaii. Mr. Vernon determinedthat the Leasehold had a fair market value of $130,000, as of January 1,1988. (4) In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed exemption satisfiesthe criteria for an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act because (a)the Sale will be a one-time transaction for cash with no expenses incurredby the Plan; (b) the Plan will sell the Leasehold at its fair market valueas determined by a qualified, independent appraiser; (c) the Plan willreceive a higher rate of return on the proceeds from the sale than it isreceiving in rental income; and (d) investing the proceeds in more liquidinvestments with less expenses entailed will preserve and enhance the assetsof the Plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>For Further Information Contact: </T2>Mr. C.E.

If the exemptionis granted, the restrictions of section 406(a), 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) ofthe Act shall not apply to the proposed purchase by the Plan of a parcelof unimproved real property (the Tract), for the total cash considerationof $110,000, from the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America,AFL-CIO Local Union No. 626 of Wilmington, Delaware (the Union), a partyin interest with respect to the Plan, provided the amount paid by the Planfor the Tract is not more than fair market value at the time the transactionis consummated.Summary of Facts and Representations1. The Plan is an employee welfare plan established and administered underthe terms of section 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947,as amended. The Plan provides training in carpentry skills on a non-profitbasis to participants in an apprenticeship school it operates. The geographicjurisdiction covered by the Plan is the State of Delaware. As of April30, 1987, the Plan had total assets of $383,941. As of May 1, 1988, thePlan had 546 participants. The Plan is administered by a joint board oftrustees (the Trustees) consisting of three employee or union Trusteesand three employer or management Trustees. The Trustees make investmentdecisions for the Plan. The Union is a labor organization having its principaloffices in New Castle, Delaware.2. In 1965, the Union acquired a parcel of real property (the Real Property)located at 626 Wilmington Road, New Castle, Delaware. The Union purchasedthe Real Property from The Pompeii Restaurant, Inc., an unrelated party,for $30,000. The Real Property consists of approximately 6.72 acres ofland. A portion of the Real Property is improved with a one story buildingthat is occupied by the Union. There is also a parking facility on theland. At present, the Real Property is unencumbered by a mortgage.3. In December 1987, the Plan began using, on a gratuitous basis, an unimproved,one acre portion of the Real Property as well as the Union's parking facility.The subject Tract is directly south of the existing one story structureand parking lot. The Tract was selected for the Plan because of its proximityto Union offices, Union personnel and to contributing employers. In addition,the applicants represent that the size and cost of renovation of othersites renders them less attractive in terms of cost benefit and convenience.4. The Plan has begun constructing a $680,000 prefabricated building onthe Tract. Although the building is expected to be occupied by September1988, a substantial amount of interior work will remain for completionby the apprentices.\4\<NOTE/> The building will be owned by the Plan and serve as a newapprenticeship school. The school will permit year-round training for Planparticipants in all aspects of carpentry work. In order to construct theschool, the Plan has obtained financing in the amount of $495,000 fromunrelated parties. After the school is completed, the Plan does not intendto lease any portion of the building to parties in interest.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ In this proposed exemption the Department expresses noopinion as to whether the Plan's construction of a building on land ownedby the Union violated any provision of Part 4 of Title I of the Act.5. To enable the Plan to establish a permanent location in which to conductits operations, the Trustees request an administrative exemption that willpermit the Plan to purchase the Tract from the Union. The proposed salesprice will be based upon the fair market value of the Tract as determinedby an independent appraiser. The Plan will make a lump sum payment in cashto the Union. In addition, the Plan will not be required to pay any realestate fees or commissions in connection with the sale. Subsequent to thesale, the deed to the Tract will be recorded to reflect the Plan's separableand ascertainable ownership of the subject property. Further, it is anticipatedthat the Plan will continue its use of the Union's parking lot on a rent-freebasis.6. Penny M. Virtue (Ms. Virtue), S.C.V., A.P.R.A., an independent appraiseraffiliated with Appraisals Limited of Wilmington, Delaware, valued theTract as if it had been separated and subdivided from the Real Property.Based upon an appraisal report dated February 16, 1988, Ms. Virtue determinedthat the Tract has a fair market value of $110,000 as of February 9, 1988.7. John E. Stapleford, Ph.D. (Dr. Stapleford) will serve as the independentfiduciary for the Plan with respect to the proposed transaction. Dr. Staplefordis an economist from Newark, Delaware who has rendered expert advice intort cases. Dr. Stapleford has been employed as the director of a nonprofituniversity research center and has served on the boards of two educationalinstitutions and a nonprofit organization. Dr. Stapleford represents thathe has no family, business or investment relationship with any of the employerscontributing to the Plan. Dr. Stapleford states that he has been advisedby counsel for the Plan of his duties, responsibilities and liabilitiesunder the Act as a fiduciary. Dr. Stapleford also asserts that he understandsand acknowledges these duties, responsibilities and liabilities in actingas a fiduciary to the Plan.Dr. Stapleford believes the proposed transaction is in the best interestsof the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries because: (a) The natureof the Plan's investment in the subject property fulfills the educationalpurposes of the Plan; (b) in providing educational benefits to participants,the Plan has legitimately set its priority to acquiring operating facilitiesthat are customized to its special needs in a location that is convenientto its staff and a Plan participants; (c) the apprenticeship school willbe industrial in nature and adaptable to alternative uses; (d) the subjectproperty will be mortgageable on relatively short notice without liquidatingthe investment and interrupting operations; and (e) the Plan's net assetsshould be sufficient to cover its debt service. In forming his opinion,Dr. Stapleford has reviewed the exemption application, Ms. Virtue's writtenappraisal of the Tract and all other documentation associated with thePlan. Dr. Stapleford also states that he has examined the Plan's liquidityneeds and diversification requirements and he believes both of these portfoliocriteria are adequate. Finally, Dr. Stapleford represents that he willattend the closing of the sale of the Tract and monitor such transaction.In this connection, Dr. Stapleford explains that he will take all appropriateactions to safeguard the interests of the Plan. 8. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transaction will satisfythe statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) The Planwill not pay more than fair market value for the Tract as such value isdetermined by an independent appraiser; (b) the sale of the Tract willinvolve a one-time payment for cash; (c) the Plan will not be requiredto pay any real estate fees or commissions in connection therewith; (d)the Plan participants will benefit from the gratuitous use of the parkinglot on the adjoining Real Property as well as from the support servicesprovided to Plan participants by Union and employer personnel; and (e)Dr. Stapleford, an independent fiduciary who will monitor the sale transaction,has determined the purchase is at arm's length and in the best interestsof the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>For Further Information Contact:</T2> Ms. Jan D.

The Employer is engaged in the practiceof radiology in Fort Worth, Texas and its environs. As of December 31,1987, the Employer had a total of 119 employees.The Trustee was a national banking association, organized under the lawsof United States, and acquired during 1987 by the First RepublicBank FortWorth, which was another national banking association, wholly owned bythe First RepublicBank Corporation. On July 29, 1988, the Comptroller ofthe Currency declared all of the banks in the First Republic system (FirstRepublicBank) to be insolvent and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation(FDIC) was appointed Receiver. FDIC, exercising its authority as Receiver,created a new bank, JRB Bank, National Association (JRB Bank) and enteredinto a Purchase and Assumption Agreement with JRB Bank. Under the Purchaseand Agreement JRB Bank acquired certain assets and liabilities of FirstRepublicBank, and succeeded First RepublicBank Fort Worth, N.A. as Trusteefor the Plan. JRB Bank changed its name to NCNB Texas National Bank, whichis a national banking association organized under the Competitive EqualityBanking Act of 1987.The Trustee and the Employer are represented to be independent of eachother, having no common shareholders, officers, or directors and neitherowning shares of the other. There has been a banking relationship betweenthe Trustee and the Employer and its principal shareholder which is representedto be less than one percent of the Trustee's business.(2) The Plan is a defined contribution plan with individual accounts forits 138 participants and with total assets of $20,326,367.61, as of December31, 1987. Participation in the Plan is voluntary and is available to allemployees of the Employer after completion of a minimum service requirement.In addition to the funding contributions by the Employer, participantsare authorized to make contributions to the Plan and to direct the investmentsof their respective individual accounts. Directions by participants aregiven in writing to the Trustee for the investment of certain percentagebalances in their individual accounts rather than by specifying certaindollar amounts to be invested. Participants may choose from 8 to 16 differentfunds during each half of the calendar year for investments to be madeat the beginning of the succeeding six months. This method for directinginvestments can result in cash flow problems because it compels the Trusteeto estimate the dollar value of each individual account as of July 1 andJanuary 1 of each calendar year. One of the investment options availableto the participants during 1985 was units of an open-end collective trustfund, designated as the Real Estate Collective Investment Fund (RECIF),which was maintained and trusteed by FirstRepublic Bank Dallas, N.A., awholly owned subsidiary of the Trustee's former parent corporation. TheRECIF is invested solely in commercial real estate which is located inregions experiencing adverse economic problems in the southwestern partof the United States. On September 23, 1986, RECIF was terminated and isbeing liquidated. All requests for withdrawal, which had been paid sequentially,are now being paid on a pro rata basis in accordance with the amount investedin RECIF.(3) In November and early December 1985, nine participants directed theTrustee to reduce the percentage balances of their respective individualaccounts that were invested in units of RECIF and to move the cash obtainedby the reductions to selected alternative funds. During February 1986 whenprocessing the changes in investments as directed by the nine participants,the Trustee discovered that the cash available from the units of RECIFwere insufficient for making the alternative investments chosen by thenine participants. There was found to be an adjusted cash flow shortagebecause of rapidly rising values in the securities markets while therewere drastically decreasing values in the commercial real properties inwhich RECIF was invested. These changing cash values of the individualaccounts for December 31, 1985, resulted in an adjusted cash flow shortageof $197,553.66. Since RECIF had always funded withdrawal requests and theTrustee was unaware of the mounting liquidity problems of the RECIF, theTrustee assumed in April 1986 that the $197,553.66 would be immediatelyavailable from the units of the RECIF. This assumption caused the Trusteeon April 14, 1986, to allow an overdraft in the form of an interest-freeloan to the Plan for $197,553.66 in order that the nine participants couldmake their chosen alternative investments.\5\<NOTE/> Commencing in September 1986 a portion of the liquidatingdistributions from RECIF, in the sum of $42,367.42, has been credited bythe Trustee against its loan to the Plan, leaving a current balance owingof $155,186.24. Only that portion of the distribution by RECIF which wouldhave been credited to the nine participants individual accounts had theloan not occurred has been applied against the loan. This portion equals42 percent of the liquidating distributions from RECIF. As to future paymentsof the loan, the Trustee will continue to forego interest on the unpaidportion of the loan and will continue to apply 42 percent of the proceedsreceived from RECIF to the repayment of the loan. Upon receipt of the entireamount of the loan from RECIF any access receipts from RECIF will be allocatedfor the benefit of the nine participants. If the proceeds received in liquidationof RECIF are less than the loan, no other Plan assets can be used to payoff the loan. The applicants represent that the loan from the Trustee tothe Plan resulted in no expense to the Plan and no risk to participantsof the Plan. In addition, the loan facilitated the participants in obtainingbetter investments for their respective individual accounts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The loan will be documented by a non-interest bearingdebenture with no security interest except the pro-rata share of the liquidatingproceeds received from RECIF.(4) In summary, the applicants represent that the transaction satisfiesthe criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons (a)the loan will be evidenced in a written document which does not providethe payment of interest by the Plan; (b) the transaction protects the participantsand their beneficiaries for the Plan from a decline in the value of theRECIF properties and permits new, higher yielding investments without expenseor penalty; (c) the terms for repayment of the loan is limited to cashproceeds received from liquidation of RECIF commercial properties and noother assets of the Plan will be used or affected; and (d) upon liquidationof RECIF investments, any proceeds in excess of the loan will be allocatedto the nine individual accounts of the Plan participants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>For Further Information Contact:</T2> Mr. C.E.

The Plan is a defined contribution plan with 317 participants as ofDecember 31, 1987. The Employer is a multi-speciality group medical practicein Evansville, Indiana. The trustee of the Plan is the Citizens NationalBank of Evansville (the Trustee), which represents itself to be independentof and unrelated to the Employer. The Employer's principal place of businessis the Welborn Clinic Building (the Clinic), which the Employer leasesfrom the Plan. The Trustee and the Employer are requesting an exemption,effective February 28, 1987, for the Employer's lease of the Clinic fromthe Plan under the terms and conditions described herein.2. The Clinic was constructed over a twenty-four year period commencingin 1950, when the original clinic building (the Original Clinic) was constructed,and continued with subsequent improvements and expansions in 1954, 1959and 1967. The Plan acquired the 35,000 square foot Original Clinic, includingthe underlying land, from its predecessor plan in 1960 and commenced leasingthe Original Clinic to the Employer under a net lease (the Original Lease).In 1974 the Original Clinic was expanded substantially with a 65,000 squarefoot addition (the Addition) constructed by the City of Evansville, Indiana(the City) on City-owned land (hereinafter included in references to theAddition) abutting the Original Clinic. Upon completion of the Addition,the Plan leased the Addition, including furnishings and medical equipmentinstalled therein (the Equipment), from the City (the City Lease). TheCity Lease granted the Plan options (the Options) to purchase the Additionand the Equipment under certain stated circumstances.Upon commencement of the City Lease, the Employer began subleasing theAddition from the Plan under a net sublease (the Sublease) which ensuredthat rentals received by the Plan thereunder would always exceed the rentalswhich the Plan paid the City under the City Lease. The Sublease, with aninitial term of 20 years, was effective June 1, 1974. On that date thePlan and the Employer also executed a renewal of the Original Lease (theRenewed Lease), which has continued on a year-to-year basis since its initialterm expired in 1979. The Employer represents that its lease of the OriginalClinic from the Plan under the Original Lease and the Renewed Lease andits sublease of the Addition from the Plan under the Sublease were exemptuntil June 30, 1984 from the prohibitions of section 406 of the Act byvirtue of section 414(c)(2) of the Act.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ In this proposed exemption the Department expresses noopinion as to whether the leases and the Sublease satisfied the requirementsof section 414 of the Act.Prior to June 30, 1984, fiduciaries of the Plan exercised the Plan's Optionto purchase the Equipment from the City and then sold the Equipment tothe Employer. The Employer represents that its purchase of the Equipmentfrom the Plan was exempt from the prohibitions of section 406 of the Actby virtue of section 414(c)(3) of the Act.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ In this proposed exemption the Department expresses noopinion as to whether the sale satisfied the requirements of section 414of the Act.During 1984 the necessary actions were initiated to enable the Plan toexercise the Option to purchase the Addition from the City. The Plan acquiredfull title to the Addition on June 1, 1985 and has continued to lease theAddition to the Employer. As a result of the consolidated ownership ofthe Original Clinic and the Addition by the Plan, and in recognition thatthe Employer occupies and operates the formerly separate parcels as oneconsolidated Clinic facility, the Original Lease and the Sublease havebeen combined, amended and replaced with a single lease agreement (theNew Lease) which governs the Employer's lease of the Clinic from the Planand under which the Employer proposes to continue leasing the Clinic.3. The New Lease is an absolute net lease for a fixed term which expireson May 31, 2009. The Trustee represents the interests of the Plan underthe New Lease. Rentals under the New Lease are paid monthly and are subjectto adjustment at five-year intervals to ensure that they remain no lessthan the fair market rental value of the Clinic property. For the periodcommencing August 1, 1988 and ending May 31, 1989, the rental (the BaseRent) shall be the greater of (1) $77,760 per month, or (2) the monthlyfair market rental value of the Clinic as determined by a qualified independentappraiser selected by the Trustee. Thereafter, commencing June 1, 1989,the monthly rental shall be redetermined on June 1 every five years asthe greater of (1) the monthly fair market rental value of the Clinic asdetermined by an independent qualified appraiser selected by the Trustee,or (2) the Base Rent adjusted for increases in the Consumer Price Index(the CPI) of the Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics in accordancewith a procedure set forth in the New Lease.Under the New Lease the Employer assumes all expenses of maintenance andrepair of the Clinic and all costs of utility services to the Clinic. Asadditional rent, the Employer is obliged to pay all real estate taxes relatedto the Clinic property. The New Lease requires the Employer to purchaseand maintain such insurance of the Clinic premises as the Trustee may reasonablyrequire, to include fire and extended coverage insurance in an amount equalto full replacement cost, comprehensive bodily injury and property damageinsurance in amounts required by the Trustee, and rent insurance. Underthe New Lease the Employer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Planagainst any claims and liabilities of any nature arising from the Employer'suse of the Clinic premises or the Employer's noncompliance with any provisionsof the New Lease. In the event the Employer defaults on the payment ofrent under the New Lease or fails to fulfill any other obligation thereunder,the New Lease empowers the Trustee with remedial options which includetaking possession of the premises and removing the Employer, terminatingthe New Lease, suing for damages while continuing the New Lease in effect,and any and all other remedies available to the Trustee at law or in equity.Upon expiration of the New Lease, provided that the Employer has performedall its obligations thereunder, the Employer may, subject to the Trustee'sapproval, renew the New Lease for no more than four successive renewalterms of five years each. The Trustee may decline to approve any renewaland the Employer may decline to renew. For any such renewal term, the rentalshall be the greater of (1) the Clinic's monthly fair market rental valueas determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the Trustee,or (2) the monthly rental paid during the immediately preceding five-yearperiod adjusted for increases in the CPI according to a procedure set forthin the New Lease.4. The Trustee maintains that it is independent of and unrelated to theEmployer and that it has substantial experience as a fiduciary under theAct. The Trustee states that it has represented the Plan's interests underthe previous lease arrangements with the Employer, including active andexclusive representation of the Plan's interests as of February 28, 1987,the effective date of the exemption proposed herein. The Trustee representsthat it continues and will continue to represent the interests of the Planactively and for all purposes under the New Lease. The Trustee representsthat it fully understands its responsibilities as a fiduciary in this matterand that it will discharge its duties solely in the interests of the participantsand beneficiaries of the Plan. In considering whether the Plan should retainthe Clinic as an investment past June 30, 1984, the Trustee representsthat it explored the possible alternatives, thoroughly evaluated the Plan'sinvestment in the Clinic from various perspectives, and concluded thatthe Clinic constitutes an excellent investment for the Plan. The Trusteerepresents that since 1975 the Plan has received rent from the Employerin amounts equal to or greater than the Clinic's fair market rental value.The Trustee maintains that the terms of the New Lease adequately protectthe Plan's interests in the Clinic and observes that they are sufficientto ensure that rentals will remain no less than the Clinic's fair marketrental value. According to the Trustee, the Plan's investment in the Clinicis consistent with an appropriate diversification of the Plan's total assets.Specifically, the Trustee represents that the value of the Clinic constitutedless than 25 percent of the Plan's total assets as of February 27, 1987and that it will constitute no more than 25 percent of the Plan's totalassets on the date this exemption, if granted, is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. According to David Matthews, MAI, an independentprofessional real estate appraiser in Evansville, Indiana, the unencumberedfee simple title of the Clinic had a fair market value of $6,350,000 asof December 31, 1987 and the renal payments of $77,760 per month underthe New Lease were in excess of the Clinic's fair market rental value.5. The Employer recognizes that the continuation of the subject lease arrangementpast June 30, 1984 to February 28, 1987 constituted a prohibited transactionunder the Act and the Code for which the Department is not proposing exemptiverelief herein. Accordingly, the Employer represents that within 60 daysafter the publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of a notice granting the exemption proposed herein,it will file a Form 5330 with the Internal Revenue Service and pay theexcise taxes which are applicable under section 4975(a) of the Code asa result of the continuation of the lease arrangements from June 30, 1984to February 28, 1987.6. In summary, the applicant represents that the past and proposed transactionssatisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons:(1) The interests of the Plan for all purposes under the subject leasearrangements have been and will be represented by the Trustee, a fiduciarywhich is independent of and unrelated to the Employer; (2) the New Leaseis an absolute net lease under which the Employer pays all costs of maintenanceand repair, full insurance coverage, and all taxes and utilities for theClinic and indemnifies the Plan against all claims and liabilities resultingfrom use in the Clinic; (3) the New Lease includes a procedure to ensurethat rentals paid by the Employer remain no less than the Clinic's fairmarket rental value; (4) after a thorough evaluation, the Trustee determinedthat the Clinic constituted an excellent and appropriate investment forthe Plan; and (5) the Trustee's approval is required by any renewal orextension of the New Lease.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Ronald Willett of the Department,telephone (202) 523-8881.
