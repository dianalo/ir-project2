The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 8.54%, the lowest level since mid-July of last year and down from 9 1/8% as recently as about two weeks ago. Prices of some actively traded long-term Treasury issues soared nearly two points, or $20 for each $1,000 face amount. The powerful rally, which more than offset Tuesday's mild slump, came even as the Treasury announced plans to sell $27 billion of notes and bonds next week.    Early yesterday, the Commerce Department reported a large buildup of inventories last quarter as consumer spending weakened. Economists say companies are slowing their production in an effort to pare inventories. The report also indicated that &quot;the inflation situation looks better,&quot; said Manuel Johnson, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.    &quot;Bonds look very attractive,&quot; said Alan G. Bozian, a first vice president of the Union Bank of Switzerland. &quot;It looks like an economic slowdown is coming and the dollar has stabilized.&quot;    Further declines in borrowing costs are inevitable, contended Roger A. Froehlich, president of Technical Dimensions, a Mt. Kisco, N.Y., bond market forecasting and advisory service. &quot;It is a virtual certainty&quot; that the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds will drop below 8 1/4% before the end of March, he said.    An even more optimistic forecast comes from Richard L. Sandor, senior vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and head of the firm's institutional financial futures division. He argued that Treasury bond yields &quot;could fall as low as 8% in the months ahead.&quot; But Mr. Sandor also predicted that yields could bounce back up to as high as 11% over the next 18 months because he expects inflationary bottlenecks associated with the late stages of an economic expansion to buffet the economy.    In the fourth quarter, the economy expanded at an energetic 4.2% annual rate, after adjusting for inflation, according to the Commerce Department report. That was higher than most analysts had expected and followed a 4.3% pace in the third quarter. But analysts paid much more attention to the inventory bulge that they said signaled sluggish growth early this year.    The optimism mood that swept the bond markets represented an abrupt change from Tuesday. Bond prices sank early Tuesday after the government reported an unexpectedly large increase in durable goods orders last month. That report, also from the Commerce Department, showed a huge 6.7% increase in new orders for big-ticket factory goods in December, the largest increase since September 1986.    More than two-thirds of last month's improvement in durable goods orders came from aircraft orders, which are especially volatile from month to month. Still, bond traders and economists were surprised by the size of the increase, and some said it might persuade the Federal Reserve to postpone any immediate plans to ease credit. Now, though, those forecasts already appear obsolete.    &quot;Now we've got fresh information, and it looks like inflation isn't an issue any more,&quot; said Mr. Bozian of the Union Bank of Switzerland. He and several other analysts noted that the price of gold, an especially closely watched indicator of inflation pressures, has fallen sharply this month.    The Treasury's quarterly financing announcement yesterday was in line with what traders generally had expected. The package consisted of $9.25 billion of three-year notes to be sold Tuesday, $9 billion of 10-year notes to be sold Wednesday and $8.75 billion of 29 1/4-year bonds to be auctioned the following day. The bonds will be a reopening of the Treasury's 8 3/4% bonds due May 15, 2017.    Japanese investors are likely to bid aggressively for the securities because the outlook for the dollar appears brighter, some traders said. Also, investment managers say the difference between U.S. and Japanese interest rates is wide enough to attract more Japanese investors to increase their holdings of U.S. securities.    Corporate and municipal bond prices also surged but not as much as Treasury issues did. Some long-term corporate issues rose by about 1 1/4 points, or $12.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Municipal specialists say underwriters still are struggling under the weight of a large volume of new issues recently.    Among the new issues yesterday was about $134.5 million of refunding bonds by the Municipal Assistance Corp. for New York City. Yields range from 6.75% on bonds due in 1998 to 7.673% on bonds due in 2008, according to Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    Several new corporate debt issues also were offered to investors. The largest was $500 million of Mobil Oil Canada Ltd. notes. The 8 3/8% notes, which come due in about five years, were priced at 99.92 to yield 8.393%, or 0.45 percentage point above comparable Treasury notes, according to Merrill Lynch. The notes, which are noncallable, are rated double-A-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. Mobil Oil Canada is an affiliate of Mobil Oil Corp., a subsidiary of Mobil Corp.    Separately, American Express Credit Co. sold $200 million of senior notes due in about seven years. The 8 3/4% notes were priced at 99.60 to yield 8.828%, or about 5/8 percentage point above the rate on comparable Treasury notes. The notes, which are noncallable, are rated double-A-2 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P. American Express Credit is a unit of American Express Co.    Elsewhere in the credit markets, the Financing Corp., which was set up last August to raise funds for the embattled Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. is offering $650 million of 30-year bonds. The 9.4% bonds were priced at 99.75 to yield about 9.42%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds, compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., surged 22.77 points, the largest advance since Jan. 15. The index closed at 1303.99. It ranged between 1291.48 and 1305.03.    The Treasury's latest 30-year bonds were quoted late in the afternoon at a price of 103 18/32, up sharply from 101 23/32 Tuesday. Since the Oct. 19 stock market crash, the yield on this issue has plunged nearly two percentage points from about 10 1/2%.    The government's latest 10-year notes surged to 103 1/2 from 102 7/32. The yield fell to 8.34% from 8.53%.    Short-term interest rates also fell. The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bill declined to 5.73% bid from 5.8%, while the latest six-month Treasury bill rate dropped to 6.08% bid from 6.19%.    The federal funds rate also declined, averaging 6.62%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was down from 6.78% Tuesday. The rate on funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, often strongly influences many other borrowing costs. Some analysts predict the Fed will try to nudge the funds rate down to the 6 1/2% area soon.    The Treasury yesterday sold new two-year notes at an average annual yield of 7.4%. Here are details of that auction:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                         2-Year Notes   Applications ........................ $29,648,920,000   Accepted bids .......................  $8,765,625,000   Accepted at low price ...............             69%   Accepted noncompetitively ...........  $1,117,000,000   Average price (Rate) ................   99.954(7.40%)   High price (Rate) ...................   99.973(7.39%)   Low price (Rate) ....................   99.936(7.41%)   Interest rate .......................           7 3/8   The notes are dated Feb. 1 and mature Jan. 31, 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
