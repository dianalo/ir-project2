The union, which represents 3,500 production and 600 office workers at the commuter-aircraft maker, previously said its members voted to strike, but it hadn't set a strike deadline. The current three-year contract expires next Monday.    The union said de Havilland's contract offer last week contained many concession demands that the union termed &quot;completely unacceptable.&quot; A union spokeswoman said wages haven't been discussed yet.    Boeing, the Seattle-based commercial-aircraft maker and defense concern, acquired de Havilland from the Canadian government in January 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
