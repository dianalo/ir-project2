First, the current standards and recommendationsof other agencies are presented as an overview of current consensus asto relative hazards of asbestos, MMMF, and cristobalite (a form of crystallinesilica). Then, a summary of recent epidemiological evidence is presented.These data should be the most relevant for human exposure. Unfortunately,there are no data for workers in the ceramic-fiber field. Then a reviewis presented of the data from animal experiments which employed exposureby inhalation, intratracheal instillation, and intrapleural or intraperitonealinjection. The experiments reviewed involve only non-ceramic MMMF. Somedetail of the protocol and results of each experiment are presented toprovide a better understanding of the non-uniformity of the protocolsused. Another issue of particular importance in understanding fiber toxicityis the durability of the fiber. These data are presented for non ceramicMMMF.</TEXT></DOC>
