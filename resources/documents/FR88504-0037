This proposal outlined severaloptions for implementing the ban and phase out and allowed 5 months forpublic comment. EPA received approximately 200 written comments. EPA receivedfurther public comment on the proposal in legislative and cross-examinationhearings held in July and October of 1986.On April 1, 1988, EPA requested comment on four major documents to be usedto support its rulemaking for the ban and phase out of certain uses ofasbestos (53 FR 10546). The deadline for comments on these documents isMay 31, 1988. The four asbestos support documents were: The Asbestos ExposureAssessment, the Asbestos Modeling Study, the Nonoccupational Asbestos ExposureReport, and the Regulatory Impact Analysis.Today, EPA is placing four additional documents concerning substitutesfor asbestos in the public rulemaking docket for comment: The Health HazardAssessment of Non-Asbestos Fibers, the Review of Recent EpidemiologicalInvestigations on Populations Exposed to Selected Non-Asbestos Fibers,the Durable Fiber Exposure Assessment, and the Durable Fiber Industry Profileand Market Outlook. The Health Hazard Assessment of Non-Asbestos Fibersevaluates the potential hazard of major non-asbestos fibers. The Reviewof Recent Epidemiological Investigations on Populations Exposed to SelectedNon-Asbestos Fibers was used to develop the Health Hazard Assessment Document.The Durable Fiber Exposure Assessment summarizes information concerningexposure during primary and secondary manufacturing, and consumer use ofmajor non-asbestos fibers. The Durable Fiber Industry Profile and MarketOutlook assesses the important physical and chemical properties, productioncharacteristics, commercial uses, and market outlooks of major non-asbestosfibers.After reviewing these four documents, interested persons may submit commentson them EPA's consideration. The deadline for comments on these documentsis June 14, 1988. The four documents added today set forth well documentedanalyses based on factual information obtained from public and privatesources. In particular, persons are encouraged to take this opportunityto point out any factual inaccuracies and omissions in the data set forthin these documents.
