Attorneys said the 2-1 ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington could subject thegovernment to millions of dollars in liability for asbestos-relatedexposure dating to the 1930s.   ``The government specified products with asbestos in it, thegovernment controlled working conditions and the government in theview of many people has the primary responsibility for whathappened,'' Andrew Berry, a Newark, N.J., attorney for severalasbestos makers, said Wednesday.   Companies that made asbestos are trying to force the governmentto reimburse them for at least a portion of liability paymentsalready exceeding $1 billion. The government to date has notadmitted responsibility or agreed to pay compensation.   The court ruling allows Eagle-Picher Inc., Keene Corp. and UNRIndustries Inc. to pursue reimbursement from the government forpayments made to asbestos victims who worked for the Navy.   ``So far only our clients have paid the tab,'' said Joe G.Hollingsworth, a Washington attorney representing UNR andEagle-Picher. ``The government has escaped liability by virtue oftechnical arguments. We'd like to prove what (its) realresponsibility was.''   David S. Fishback, a Justice Department lawyer handling thecase, declined to comment.   More than 100,000 asbestos cases involving workers afflictedwith lung cancer and other severe and often fatal diseases areclogging federal and state court dockets nationwide.   The bulk of the payouts has been made by a trust created inManville Corp. bankruptcy proceedings. The trust has run out ofmoney and is being restructured to speed payments to needy victims.Other companies also have been pushed into bankruptcy by asbestoslawsuits and want to reduce their liability.   Widespread illnesses from inhaling fibers of asbestos _ amineral used widely for its heat resistance and fire retardantqualities _ did not appear until the 1970s, in some cases afterdecades of exposure.   Manufacturers have argued the government should be held liablebecause it allegedly failed to tell them about asbestos' healthhazards and because the government was contractually responsibilefor maintaining a safe workplace.   But in numerous decisions in the last 10 years, courts haveshielded the government from liability on the grounds that it hasimmunity against lawsuits filed by federal employees. Otherprocedural arguments have helped keep cases from proceeding totrial.   Berry said the latest ruling ``places pressure on the governmentto assist in resolving the cases.''   The decision orders the U.S. Claims Court to hear anew the threecompanies' claims. It would be the first time that the merits ofwhether the government is liable _ rather than jurisdictionalissues _ are argued in court.   The U.S. Claims Court in Washington handles all claims againstthe federal government.   The companies had been blocked from pursuing lawsuits againstthe government simultaneously in claims court and federal districtcourt. But the appellate ruling said the claims court caseinvolving the government's contractual obligations with thecompanies should be heard again because it had been dismissed byother courts.   A group of defendants in more than 500 asbestos lawsuits in U.S.District Court in Brooklyn on Tuesday filed a motion seeking to addthe government to the list of defendants in the consolidated case.   The government has been held liable in only one case and wasrequired to pay one-third of an asbestos settlement of about$50,000 to a Maine woman who contracted a lung disease fromcleaning her father's asbestos-tainted clothes.   The government's claim of immunity did not apply in the 1st U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals case because the woman was not a federalemployee.   Hollingsworth, who represented the Maine woman, Joan Dube, saidthe government has not paid its portion of the settlement in thatcase or agreed to hold settlement negotiations in a similar case.</TEXT></DOC>
