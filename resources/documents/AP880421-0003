SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III wassummoned to a private meeting with President Reagan at the WhiteHouse on Wednesday after Reagan met with two Justice Departmentofficials who resigned in protest over Meese's continued tenure, adepartment source said Thursday night.   The source, who declined to be identified, said Deputy AttorneyGeneral Arnold Burns and former Assistant Attorney General WilliamWeld, who headed the department's criminal division, met at theWhite House with Reagan and Vice President George Bush and someWhite House staff members.   During that 45-minute meeting, Burns told the president, Bush,White House chief of staff Howard Baker and White House counselA.B. Culvahouse that ``Meese's behavior was hurting the Departmentof Justice,'' another administration source said.   Weld, meanwhile, ``laid out the facts'' in a hypotheticalindictment he said he would have brought against Meese if he werethe special prosecutor investigating the attorney general.   Meese has been under investigation for nearly a year byindependent counsel James McKay, who is looking into a handful ofincidents to see if Meese violated conflict-of-interest or otherfederal laws.   It was not immediately known what occurred during Meese'smeeting at the White House, which immediately followed theBurns-Weld meeting, but Meese said in an interview Thursday withUSA Today that the president has continued to express his ``totalsupport ... and total confidence.''   During the earlier White House meeting with the departingJustice Department officials, Burns ``laid out the reasons whyMeese should leave,'' said the source, who also spoke on conditionof anonymity. He added that Burns never specifically suggested thatMeese should resign.   Burns told Reagan that Meese had violated the standards ofethical conduct for executive branch employees spelled out in a1965 executive order.   Those standards, among other things, say that employees shouldavoid any action which could create the appearance of using publicoffice for private gain, giving preferential treatment to anyorganization or person and making a government decision outsideofficial channels.   Burns specifically mentioned longtime Meese friend E. RobertWallach, who is under indictment in the Wedtech scandal, as havingtaken advantage of his relationship with the attorney general topromote his own business interests.   Burns, while not using these specific words, in effect toldReagan that ``Wallach was selling the office of the attorneygeneral,'' said the source.   Another administration source familiar with the Wednesdaymeetings was asked about the outcome. ``As you can see, there wasno change,'' he responded.   A Justice Department spokesman, Dean St. Dennis, had noimmediate comment.   Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, said late Thursday thathe was unfamiliar with either of the meetings Wednesday.   ``I have no idea what you're talking about,'' he said. ``I can'tconfirm or deny.''   He noted, however, that White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwatersaid this week that Reagan has ``full confidence'' in Meese.   Burns and Weld have not discussed publicly their reasons forsubmitting their resignations March 29, but sources close to themhave said they felt that Meese's continued tenure in the departmentwhile he is under investigation by an independent counsel washampering department operations.   During the White House meeting, Weld told Reagan that if he werethe special prosecutor in the criminal investigation of Meese, hewould seek an indictment of the attorney general, said theadministration source.   Weld had made similar comments to Meese on March 29 when Weldand Burns announced to the attorney general that they wereresigning.   According to the source, Weld in the meeting with the president``laid out the facts'' in a hypothetical indictment.   ``The president was very attentive, listened to the story, gotup and Meese came in'' after Burns and Weld left, said theadministration source.   In the past, said several sources, speaking on condition ofanonymity, Weld has told Justice Department associates that hefeels a number of felony charges could be lodged against Meesebased on the factual evidence known to date in the nearly year-longprobe of Meese. These include conspiracy counts involving theacceptance of illegal gratuities, a violation of Ethics inGovernment Act provisions spelling out conflicts of interest and aviolation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act barring bribes toforeign officials.   One knowledgeable source said that Meese had been summoned tothe White House and met privately with Reagan and possibly Bushafter Weld had met with Meese on the day he resigned.   The source was unable to provide any details of thatconversation.   McKay is looking into Meese's ties to the scandal-plaguedWedtech Corp. and a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project.   McKay is also known to be looking into Mrs. Meese's$40,000-a-year job with the Multiple Sclerosis Society. Mrs.Meese's salary is underwritten by The Bender Foundation, atax-exempt philanthropy run by a Washington real estate family.   The Associated Press reported last week that a partnershipheaded by Howard M. Bender, the foundation's vice president, owneda building for which the government signed a $50 million lease fora Justice Department office building in May 1987. Thirteen daysafter signing the lease, the Bender partnership sold the buildingfor a $22.6 million profit.   Meese has denied any wrongdoing and said he didn't have anythingto do with the lease.   The attorney general said Thursday that he meets the highestethical standards expected of public officials and knows of nofactor ``right now that would cause me to resign.''   In the interview published in Friday's editions of USA Today,Meese said the president has continued to express his ``totalsupport ... and total confidence.''   However, he did not rule out resigning before Reagan's term ends.   ``I've never set a particular limit of how long I would stay orhow long I wouldn't stay. A lot would depend upon my ownpost-federal service employment situation and so on,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
