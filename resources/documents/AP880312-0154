(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A huge chemical fire emitting potentiallydangerous fumes forced the evacuation of about 500 residents for atime Saturday as it destroyed a huge warehouse and set fire to twohomes.   Ten people including seven firefighters were injured in the fireat the Werco chemical warehouse complex, authorities said.   The evacuees were allowed to return home later in the day butwere instructed to boil drinking water into Sunday, said LynnBehringer, spokeswoman for the Will County Emergency Services andDisaster Agency.   Strong winds blew smoke and sparks directly into the downtownarea of Rockdale, a town of about 2,000 residents southwest ofChicago, and exploding chemicals punctuated the flames.   ``It looked like the Fourth of July,'' said Mrs. Behringer.``Considering the magnitude of this fire and the number of homes soclose, we are very lucky.'' Of the two homes set ablaze, one washeavily damaged.   The warehouse complex, which covered several square blocks,stored some 60 kinds of chemicals for various businesses.   Village President Donald B. Gould said police began evacuatingresidents about 5 a.m. because of the potential danger from thefumes, although the identity of the full range of chemicals was notknown. The evacuation area eventually covered two square miles,officials said.   After the evacuation order was lifted, residents were told toboil drinking water because of low water pressure from thefirefighting.   The cause of the fire and the dollar loss were not immediatelydetermined.   Seven firefighters and three other people were treated andreleased at hospitals in Joliet and Morris, spokesmen said.</TEXT></DOC>
