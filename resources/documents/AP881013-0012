Smith says of his southern African homeland.   Zimbabwe is widely regarded as a black African success storyunder President Robert Mugabe, the guerrilla leader who took overin 1980 in a British-mediated settlement granting independence toits last African colony.   Smith once grabbed world headlines but now lectures to smallaudiences. In Brighton, a few hundred white Rhodesian emigres andmembers of pro-South African lobbies gathered at a fringe meetingorganized by right-wing legislator John Carlisle during this week'sannual convention of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'sConservative Party.   Mugabe's permission of his old arch-enemy to stay in Zimbabwewith his wife and children is seen as a sign of magnanimity.   ``Maybe there's a certain amount of reciprocity,'' says Smith.``According to our laws, Mugabe and (ex-guerrilla leader Joshua)Nkomo and the rest of them should have been killed by us and Ididn't kill them.''   Smith was born in Rhodesia and grew up staunchly loyal toBritain. He served as a Royal Air Force fighter pilot in World WarII. His face is still partially paralyzed by war wounds.   But when Britain began dismantling its African empire andpressure mounted for black majority rule in Rhodesia, Smith led hiscountry to secede from Britain. The price for Rhodesia's 6.7million blacks and 275,000 whites was 15 years of punitiveinternational sanctions and a seven-year civil war that cost 30,000lives.   Now the gaunt, graying figure has sallied out from his farm incentral Zimbabwe to add a personally risky footnote to hisoft-written political obituary.   A year ago Smith was suspended from Zimbabwe's Parliament, wherehe held one of a handful of seats reserved for whites. These havesince been abolished and Smith has resigned.   He was suspended for making supportive remarks about neighboringwhite-ruled South Africa. Some of Mugabe's associates are callingfor a ban on him returning home from his present lecture tour inthe United States and Britain.   In his speech, the sense of grievance, the certainty of beingright in a hostile world, is unshaken. Smith denounces sanctionsagainst South Africa, recalls ruefully embargoes against Rhodesiaand talks about communist subversion and terrorist incursions.   The audience rises in an emotional ovation, and admirers surgeforward to shake his hand. Just for a moment, nothing seems to havechanged for the politician who once said Rhodesia would not haveblack rule ``in a thousand years.''   At 69, Smith is a man with no visible signs of self-doubt.   But two-thirds of the white minority he led have left thecountry, while some of his close white political associates nowbelong to Mugabe's governing party.   ``Perhaps it was convenient,'' he says.   Lord Carrington, who as British foreign secretary devised thepeace settlement, wrote in memoirs published last month that duringthe negotiations he told an impatient Smith: ``Perhaps you mightrecollect that but for you nobody in Rhodesia would be beingkilled.''   Smith denies Carrington said it. ``But even if he had said it, Iwould have reminded him that the first terrorist incursions acrossour border were in 1961 ... and they killed innocent civilians andchildren.''   As he turns to leave, there's a hint that Smith suspects he maynot end his days in the country where he was born.   ``It's my country. There's been five generations of my family inZimbabwe. I hope I can go on living there, but there may becircumstances of course which preclude that. I love the country.''</TEXT></DOC>
