The Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.43, to 469.68, a gain of 0.09%. The OTC market resisted the selling that depressed New York Stock Exchange issues. The Big Board Composite fell 0.2% on the day.    Trading volume on Nasdaq totaled almost 134 million shares. So far this month, the daily turnover has averaged 126.2 million shares. That's just ahead of the pace for July, the slowest month this year.    Individual investors &quot;aren't in the market place,&quot; said Ralph Costanza, managing director of the OTC trading desk at Smith Barney, Harris Upham.    Although the OTC market slumped last fall, with the Nasdaq composite dipping 1.4% from Aug. 31 to Nov. 30, things might be different this year.    Jonathan S. Raclin, senior vice president of Chicago Corp., said institutional investors are more interested in the small-stock sector these days. &quot;More money is coming into small stocks from (pension) plans, so investment advisers and mutual-fund managers are gravitating toward (small issues),&quot; he said.    &quot;There's been a dramatic upsurge in the number of people willing to talk about small stocks,&quot; said Mr. Raclin. He is the manager of trading, sales and research of small- and medium-sized issues at the firm, whose clients include 250 institutional investors in the U.S. and abroad.    Mr. Raclin said the institutions, which usually don't spend large sums on small stocks, are investing small portions in the issues. He added that some of the interest they are showing probably won't be converted into purchases. &quot;Certainly, not all of (the investors) are into it with both feet,&quot; he said. &quot;But it's (still) better than when they said, 'Go away.'&quot;    Added William Sulya, head of OTC trading at A.G. Edwards, St. Louis, &quot;I just think we are ready for things to break out big-time on the upside in secondary stocks.&quot; He said that while gloomy market conditions forecast by some analysts has caused many individual investors to grow more cautious, the skepticism is healthy. &quot;When everyone's saying sell your stocks, I'm one who says get in,&quot; he says.    Applied Biosystems tumbled 3 3/4 to 24 3/4 on 1.6 million shares, more than 10 times its average daily volume. The drop was precipitated by the analytic-instruments maker's announcement that earnings for the fiscal-first quarter ending Sept. 30 will be below profit of $4.4 million, or 32 cents a share, a year ago.    The company blamed increased research and development spending for the lower results. The company said the impact of the situation on the full year's results can't be determined yet.    Kurt Kruger, a Hambrecht andamp; Quist analyst, said part of the problem is that the growth of Applied Biosystems' core businesses is slowing down and its newer products will face more competition. Therefore, he said, &quot;It will take time to develop a head of steam.&quot;    He added: &quot;The company is a strong player in a high growth field, but we're getting more realistic about what it can deliver.&quot;    MCI Communications rose 1 to 40 1/4 on nearly 4.2 million shares, and was Nasdaq's most-active stock. A spokeswoman for the telecommunications concern confirmed that Morgan Stanley made positive comments about the company, Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said. The gain by MCI also pushed the Nasdaq Utility Index ahead 0.49, to 739.54.    The barometer of big industrial stocks, the Nasdaq 100 Index, slipped 0.94, to 442.40. The Nasdaq Financial Index, which tracks larger financial stocks, added 1.68, to 468.73.    First Executive continued to climb back from its recent low of 11 1/4. The stock added 1/2 to 13 1/2, third on the most active list with trading volume of more than 1.5 million shares.    Varitronic Systems tumbled 1 7/8 to 10 1/4. On Wednesday, the stock climbed 1 3/8 on what traders claimed was typical volatility before the release of the company's latest quarterly earnings.    Yesterday, Varitronic reported net income of 13 cents a share for its fiscal fourth quarter ended July 31, far below the 33 cents earned a year ago. While many analysts expected the quarter's earnings to be lower than those of last year, the results were worse than expected. Varitronic also said it is in preliminary talks with Kroy Inc. about a possible merger that would cost Varitronic about $50 million.    Cracker Barrel Old Country Store jumped 2 to 28 after it reported that net jumped more than 25% in the fiscal-fourth quarter ended July 28, to 54 cents a share from 43 cents a share a year ago.    Brite Voice Systems dropped 1 1/8 to 12 7/8. Its initial public offering was priced at $12.50 a share late Tuesday. Some analysts worry that a dispute between Brite Voice, a Wichita, Kan., manufacturer of interactive voice response and audiotex systems, and a major customer could hurt the company's earnings. Chips andamp; Technologies fell 3/4 to 20 3/4. The company cut its earnings estimate for the fiscal-first quarter ending Sept. 30, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. The expected earnings range was lowered to between 55 cents a shares and 60 cents, from the earlier projection of 60 cents a share for the quarter. Chips andamp; Technology's stock has been under pressure because of general concerns about the health of the personal-computer market and the economy in general.    Intel, a big semiconductor stock, dropped 1/4 to 29 3/4. Some software stocks were also weak. Microsoft slid 1 to 58 1/4, Lotus Development was unchanged at 26 1/2, and Rainbow Technology fell 1/4 to 19 1/4. </TEXT></DOC>
