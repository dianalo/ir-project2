Citrus growers in Florida and southern Texas inspected frostdamage in their groves.   Frozen rivers and pipes interfered with water supplies in somesouthern cities, and the Carolinas dug out after a rare Decemberblizzard.   Temperatures turned balmy across much of the Plains in the wakeof last week's surge of Arctic air that broke hundreds of lowtemperature records. Nebraska warmed into the 40s and it was thefirst time in 10 days that Indiana had no readings at or near zero,the weather service said. But a new wave of cold began pushingsouthward into Minnesota with wind chills of about 40 below zero.   Sections of Georgia, northern Florida and northern Alabama got adusting of snow on Christmas, and light snow even was reportedalong the coast of the Gulf of Mexico at Mobile, Ala.   It was only the sixth time since 1878 that Atlanta got holidaysnow, and the first Christmas snow in Mobile since record-keepingbegan in 1871.   However, temperatures began to ease. At Birmingham, Ala., thetemperature rose to 33 degrees shortly before noon _ the first timein 92 hours the mercury had been above freezing. Temperatures alsoeased in Florida, but the day started with a record of 30 degreesin Miami.   The temperature fell to an all-time record low of zero at theairport for Wilmington, N.C., which was partly paralyzed by thecold and the record 15 inches of snow that fell Sunday. Theprevious all-time low at Wilmington of 5 above had stood sinceFebruary 1899.   Other record lows Monday, all in Florida, were 29 at FortLauderdale, 46 at Key West, and a record-tying 33 at Miami Beach,the National Weather Service reported, a far cry from last weekwhen temperatures hit record lows in more than 100 cities a day.Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 17 degrees below zero atHoulton, Maine.   Elsewhere, the cold prevented the annual re-enactment of GeorgeWashington's famous Revolutionary War crossing of the DelawareRiver to capture British troops at Trenton, N.J. ``We couldn't getour four boats into the river because it was a sheet of ice,'' saidJames Gallagher, who has played the role of Washington since 1985.   Airports remained closed at Wilmington and at Myrtle Beach, S.C.   Temperatures warmed up a few degrees in South Carolina, but onthe north coast, which received well over a foot of snow in places,melting snow was expected to re-freeze on roads and make drivingtreacherous during the night.   Residents of Florida contended with rotating brownouts, and insome instances blackouts, as utilities tried to keep up with demandfor electricity.   Some people went without power for as long as 12 hours. ``Youcan't heat a house, cook a meal or take a shower,'' said EllenKirschner of Pinellas County.   Mike Mahoney, spokesman for Tampa Electric Co., appealed Mondayto families in a six-county area to forgo Christmas tree lights tosave energy.   Two of North Carolina's three main natural gas companies askedconsumers to turn down their heat Monday to ease demand on tightsupplies.   ``We are drawing from all of our emergency supply sources,''said Charles Zeigler, chairman and president of Public Service Co.of North Carolina.   Numerous burst water pipes were reported because of the cold,and water pressure was low partly from people letting water run toavoid frozen pipes.   ``We've got low pressure all over the city because of the brokenlines and people can't conserve,'' said John von Sprecken, head ofthe Mobile, Ala., water system.   ``We probably have thousands of people with busted pipes. We'veshut off literally hundreds,'' Charleston Commissioners of PublicWorks Manager Steve Kinard said Monday.   A water crisis continued at Jackson, Miss., where five days ofcold had frozen the Pearl River, the city's source of water. Cityand private crews worked to break ice around the municipal waterplant. The National Guard was called out Sunday to haul water tothe city.   Water stood up to 2 feet deep in parts of Marshall, N.C., afterice jammed at a dam, backing up the French Broad River.   It was the second straight day of cold ravaging Florida's $3.5billion citrus crop. Wind was light Christmas eve, meaning grovesthat escaped unharmed the previous night suffered freeze damage.Stiffer wind prevents frost from settling on the fruit.   ``Apparently there is a lot of iced fruit,'' said Dick Whalley,a spokesman for Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's big growercooperative.   But strawberries fared better, said Roy Parke of ParkesdaleFarms, a berry farmer in Plant City, Fla. A lack of wind allowsirrigation systems to build an even layer of ice on fragile plantsto hold them at 32 degrees. Wind scatters the water fromsprinklers, allowing lower temperatures to get to the plants.   ``We got good ice cover and I figure I'll be able to save 80percent,'' Parke said Monday.   At Harlingen, Texas, citrus grower Joe Kutzenberger said nofruit that wasn't harvested before Friday and Saturday's cold canbe salvaged.   ``It appears to me even the canneries wouldn't accept it becausethe fruit has been frozen so bad,'' Kutzenberger said.</TEXT></DOC>
