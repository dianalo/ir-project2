The family of Amjad Jibril Tawil claimed he was in army custodyafter a stone-throwing incident Wednesday and that his body wasfound Friday with bruises, burn marks and a fatal bullet wound inthe chest.   Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij said he had filed a complaint withIsraeli authorities about the death of another young Palestinian,allegedly was shot and killed Saturday in the biblical town bysecurity forces masquerading as tourists.   The army declined comment on Freij's allegations.   Arab reports said three Palestinians were killed Monday inconfrontations with soldiers.   Fourteen Palestinians were shot and wounded in stone-throwingclashes with Israeli troops during a general strike called byleaders of the 20-month-old uprising in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip, hospital officials said.   The army confirmed two deaths and four wounded.   The deaths raised to at least 543 the number of Palestinianskilled by Israeli troops and settlers since the uprising againstIsraeli rule began in December 1987. Ninety-seven Palestinians havebeen killed by fellow Arabs, and 38 Israelis have died.   Based on a reconstruction of events by an investigator and agovernment autopsy of the Tawil case, the army said, ``theconclusion is that the death of the boy was not caused by theIsraeli security forces.''   The statement did not say who was suspected of killing Tawil, whowas born in Denver, Colo., nor did it give details of the autopsy.It said police were investigating.   The family filed a petition Monday with the Supreme Courtdemanding the Tawil's body not be reburied until an independentautopsy could be performed. The body was exhumed over the weekendfor the Israeli autopsy.   Lawyer Leah Tsemel, who filed the petition, said the action wastaken after the government reneged on an earlier pledge to allow anindependent pathologist to observe the government's autopsy.   Ms. Tsemel said she also asked the court to order the army tolift its blockade of the Tawil home. Only family members andrepresentatives of the U.S. consulate have been allowed in thehouse, she said.   His family reported the boy missing Thursday. They said he wentto pray at a Ramallah mosque Wednesday and a stone-throwing incidentdeveloped after the prayer service.   Relatives said they were told by other Palestinians that he wasin army custody, but the army denied he ever was held.   The human rights group Al-Haq, based in Ramallah, issued astatement saying there was the ``possibility of official involvementin the youth's death'' and asked for an independent investigationinto the youth's death.   A military source, who insisted on anonymity, said the fatalbullet apparently was from a pistol fired at close range.   In the West Bank, two Palestinian teen-agers were shot to deathin a stone-throwing clash with Israeli troops in the village of ElRam near Jerusalem, hospital officials said.   Doctors at Mukaseed Hospital in Arab East Jerusalem identifiedthem as Wadia Mahmoud Salah, 15, and Hussein Adnan Herbawi, 14.   In Tekua, near Bethlehem, an 18-year-old Palestinian was fatallyshot in the chest, Arab reports said. Israel radio said he was firedon from a passing car, but Arab witnesses later said the youth wasshot after a clash with troops. They identified him as Sani MahmoudAtwa Sabbah.   In Jerusalem, the managing editor of the Arabic-languagenewspaper al-Fajr newspaper was arrested and placed under asix-month administrative detention, said Israel television andreporters from the newspaper.   They said it was the third time Hatem Abdel Qader was arrestedand jailed without charges since the uprising began.</TEXT></DOC>
