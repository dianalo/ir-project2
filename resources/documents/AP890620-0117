Even if radioactivity is found, however, ``it will be very hardto distinguish'' whether it came from the lost bomb or from nucleartests, said Michiaki Okubo of the Science and Technology Agency'sNuclear Safety Bureau.   Japan did not learn until last month that an A-4 Skyhawk planecarrying a hydrogen bomb rolled off the carrier Ticonderoga on Dec.5, 1965, about 80 miles from a small island near Okinawa, south ofJapan.   The bomb and plane settled in the sea bed after its radioactivematerial dissolved into the sea water, according to an official U.S.report released by the Japanese government last month.   Researchers will take water samples from eight locations andresults may be announced by September, Okubo said.   ``We will check water samples to learn about the environmentaleffects on fish,'' he said.   Okubo said no samples of earth will be taken from the sea bedwhere the bomb sank because scientists have no samples forcomparison.   Fish samples from the site already have been sent for analysis ata government research institute by a local government insouthwestern Japan, news reports said. Results should be known bymid-July.   Last month, nuclear specialist William Arkin of theWashington-based Institute for Policy Studies, which released adeclassified U.S. Navy document on the accident, said there islittle danger the bomb could detonate.   But the 33 pounds of radioactive plutonium in the bomb couldthreaten the environment as it deteriorates, he said.   Opposition parties and some citizens groups charge U.S. Navyships routinely visit Japanese ports carrying nuclear bombs inviolation of Japan's non-nuclear policies.</TEXT></DOC>
