ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Sen. George S. McGovern says he washaunted for 40 years by the fear _ which proved unfounded _ that hehad killed an innocent Austrian farm family when he jettisoned aloose explosive from the Army bomber he was piloting near the endof World War II.   McGovern, the liberal, antiwar Democratic candidate from SouthDakota who was soundly defeated by President Nixon in the 1972election, recalled the troubling wartime incident in a lectureThursday night at the National Air and Space Museum.   McGovern flew 35 combat missions against Nazi German industrialtargets as pilot of the ``Dakota Queen,'' a B-24 Liberator bomberwith the Army's 15th Air Force based in Cerignola, Italy.   Returning to his home base from a bombing run over Austria onMarch 14, 1945, McGovern said, his crew reported that the planestill carried a live bomb which had caught in its rack and wasdangling from the bomb bay.   The crew finally succeeded in dislodging the bomb before theplane landed, McGovern said.   ``We saw it fall and hit in the middle of a farmyard just as theclock showed 12 noon,'' he said. ``The house, barn and otherbuildings flew in all directions. I envisioned a young farm familysitting down for their noon meal blown to pieces.   ``When I landed back at our base in Italy, I was handed a cablesaying that Eleanor had given birth to our first child, ourdaughter Ann. The thought went through my mind that we had broughta child into the world and that same day I had killed someoneelse's children,'' he said.   In 1985, while he was a guest professor at the University ofInnsbruck in Austria, McGovern said he recalled the incident ``thatstill continued to haunt me many years later'' during a tapedinterview for an Austrian television documentary about World War II.   After the interview was broadcast, he said, ``an elderlyAustrian farmer telephoned the TV station and said that thefarmhouse I had described bombing was his.   ``He saw the bomb coming and sought safety. No one was hurt. `Wehated Adolf Hitler,' he said, `and if bombing our farmhouse helpedin any way to bring him down, tell Sen. McGovern we are grateful.'   ``So after 40 years, I was exonerated from the incident that hadbothered me since World War II,'' McGovern said.   Earlier in the war, McGovern's plane lost two of its fourengines during a raid on the Skoda ammunition works at Pilsen,Czechoslovakia, in December 1944.   The 22-year-old pilot nursed the crippled plane to a safeemergency landing, despite flames in a third engine, on a shortrunway on an island in the Adriatic Sea. That feat earned McGovernthe Distinguished Flying Cross.   McGovern, 66, is a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, aliberal Washington think tank, and lectures frequently on collegecampuses on foreign policy and domestic issues. The annual CharlesA. Lindbergh Memorial Lecture, which he delivered Thursday,celebrates the aviation pioneer's historic solo flight across theAtlantic on May 20-21, 1927.   McGovern said he proudly supported the U.S. war effort againstGermany and Japan but opposed American involvement in the VietnamWar, which he called ``the most costly single blunder in ournational history'' and ``a war we did not deserve to win.''   McGovern said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev'sinitiatives ``may enable us to end the cold war and reverse thearms race.'' He said he hoped the Bush administration ``will havethe wisdom, imagination and courage to seize on these newopportunities to build our nation and our international role aroundthe new conditions of peace.''</TEXT></DOC>
