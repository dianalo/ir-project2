(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Washington state on Friday becameAmerica's 36th state with a presidential primary, setting up hopesfor a regional set of primaries that would attract candidates tothe Pacific Northwest.   The Senate voted 38 to 10 for an initiative submitted by thepeople after the Legislature had balked for years at the idea ofeliminating the state's much-maligned caucus system of choosingnational convention delegates.   As drafted, the legislation would enable Washington to joinOregon, Idaho and Montana on the date Oregon uses, the fourthTuesday in May.   Supporters of the measure said evangelist Pat Robertson'svictory in last spring's caucuses embarrassed the state intoaccepting a primary. Washington, usually seen as a moderate,politically progressive state, carried the nation's largestRobertson delegation to the national GOP convention in New Orleanslast August.   The measure already had cleared the House by an even greatermargin. Since Gov. Booth Gardner's signature was not required,Initiative 99 was delivered directly to the secretary of stateminutes after passage.   Champagne corks popped at an impromptu celebration staged bySecretary of State Ralph Munro, a long-term sponsor who exulted,``It's finally over!''   The state will have a primary every presidential year, beginningin 1992.   Oregon is toying with changes in its primary date, and there'sno definite agreement for a four-state Super Tuesday, but theWashington legislation gives the secretary of state flexibility toset a mutually agreeable date.</TEXT></DOC>
