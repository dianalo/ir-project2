A Northrop spokesman confirmed that the Los Angelesaerospace concern notified employees internally after theraid, in which the FBI last Tuesday seized documents andrecords related to BAT from the West Complex of the company'sElectronics Systems Division. That division has headquartersnearby in Hawthorne. The spokesman said the company iscooperating with the FBI and three other agencies thatparticipated in the raid. He didn't identify the otheragencies, and added that &quot;we haven't been informed of thenature or scope of the investigation.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   An FBI spokeswoman in Los Angeles said that the bureaudoesn't confirm or deny reports involving search warrants.Representatives of the U.S. attorney's office couldn't bereached. A Defense Department spokesman declined to comment.   Aviation Week magazine reports in this week's issue thatPentagon and FBI agents involved in the raid had soughtpricing information on the BAT and Northrop's originalproposal for the Army project. The magazine also says thatpaper shredders were impounded and locks were placed on filecabinets.   Northrop first disclosed the existence of the program,also said to be called Alpha, in June. At that time, thecompany said it had received a $344 million Army contract forBAT, and was doubling employment on the project to 500. TheArmy has said the entire program could cost $2.2 billion,including development, testing and production.   Under secret development at Northrop for six years, BATwas described by the company as a &quot;submunition&quot; containingbomblets to be carried by either the Northrop-designedStealth missile or the Army Tactical Missile. The bombletsare self-guided, using acoustics and infrared sensors tofind, attack and destroy armored vehicles, possibly deepbehind enemy lines.   Numerous Northrop programs have been embroiled ininvestigations in recent years, leading the company to launcha campaign to improve its image. A new chief executiveofficer, Kent Kresa, was selected two years ago.   In the past, government investigations have evolved fromcomplaints filed by employee &quot;whistle-blowers,&quot; although theNorthrop spokesman said he wasn't aware of such a complaintleading to this recent raid.   In 1990, the company pleaded guilty to falsifying testresults during work on the air-launched cruise missile andanother weapons program. Two U.S. grand juries are continuingto examine questionable payments made to South Koreanbusinessmen, allegedly to influence Korea's decision onNorthrop's F-20 fighter plane. Past inquiries have involvedthe company's work on the guidance system for the MX missile,and Northrop's biggest current program, the B-2 Stealthbomber.</TEXT></DOC>
