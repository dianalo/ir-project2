The plan, officials said Tuesday, represents the EC position incrucial talks to reform agricultural trade in the current round oftalks within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, theGeneva-based world trade body.   The EC position was approved late Monday at a meeting of the 12EC foreign ministers. It contrasts with that of the United States,which wants to eventually eliminate all farm subsidies.   ``With this proposal the EC is taking the initiative in the farmnegotiations,'' an EC Commission source said.   In it, the EC maintains its opposition to a long-termelimination of subsidies, calling instead for a ``progressivereduction in support'' over five years with a review of thesituation at the end of that period.   Under a U.S. plan presented to GATT, existing agriculturalsubsidies would be converted into more visible tariffs thatgradually would be reduced.   The EC came slightly closer to the U.S. proposal by recommendinga partial conversion of the trade curbs into fixed tariffs. But ithas said cuts in some price supports should be ``rebalanced'' byraising others.   The U.S. opposes this, arguing it cannot accept any increases intrade barriers.   A controversial element of the EC proposal is the suggestionthat countries receive a ``credit'' for subsidy cuts made since1986, when the current Uruguay round of GATT talks began.   The EC says it has built up large credits through changes it hasmade in its farm support program over the last three years.   The EC seeks a ``global'' approach, with all trade-distortingsubsidies _ from export refunds to price guarantees _ covered inthe negotiations. It wants an international agreement on a commonmeasure of support that would be the basis for subsidy cuts by allGATT parties.   For its part, the United States has been looking for commitmentson individual support measures.</TEXT></DOC>
