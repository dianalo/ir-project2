Opponents of the Racketeer and Influenced Organization Act saidthe three- and six-month sentences given Monday indicate that thelaw, which carries a maximum term of 20 years, was usedinappropriately in the Princeton-Newport case.   Others said the short sentences were another example of thedisparate treatment between white-collar defendants and defendantsin other crimes.   U.S. District Judge Robert Carter sentenced to prison fiveformer officials of Princeton-Newport Partners LP and a formerDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader who were convicted July 31 inthe first racketeering trial of securities professionals.   The case drew wide criticism because of the use of theracketeering law, which allows prosecutors to freeze a defendant'sassets before trial. The statute also allows forfeiture ofill-gotten gains upon conviction.   Several defense lawyers who were interviewed Tuesday also saidCarter's sentences were a reflection of recent revisions in JusticeDepartment rules governing the use of the racketeering law.   The changes included restricting the use of tax violations, onwhich the Princeton-Newport case was based, in bringingracketeering charges.   ``I think the sentences reflect that these kinds of cases arenot appropriate for RICO and it was wrong to use the statute in thefirst place,'' said defense attorney Michael Armstrong.   Armstrong represents Lowell Milken, the brother of former DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond chief Michael Milken, in theirracketeering and fraud case. Much of the same evidence from thePrinceton-Newport case is expected to be introduced at the Milkens'trial, scheduled for March 1990.   The Princeton-Newport case involved a series of prearrangedstock transactions between 1984 and 1986. The government allegedthat the defendants illegally bought and sold stocks to generatephony tax losses.   Princeton-Newport, based in Princeton, N.J., and in NewportBeach, Calif., went out of business after the indictment wasbrought in August 1988. Defense lawyers said at the time that thecharges alone destroyed the firm.   Armstrong said that the financial repercussions of RICO,including the potential loss of a business, place unfair pressureon white-collar defendants to try to settle the charges through aplea bargain.   ``It's been used by certain prosecutors in the last few years asa blackjack to threaten people involved in perfectly normal kindsof disputes with the extreme racketeering penalties that the statueprovided even before trial,'' he said. ``So you had people whofeared the unknown of an extreme penalty pleading guilty to avoidit even though in their own minds they hadn't done anything wrong.''   Michael Goldsmith, a law professor at Brigham Young University,called Carter's sentences ``an outrage.''   ``I believe that his handling of this case will become a classicexample in law books of disparate treatment between white-collardefendants and street crime defendants,'' said Goldsmith, who alsoserves as vice chairman of the American Bar Association's CriminalJustice Section RICO Committee.   He said the new policies of the Justice Department were simplyan effort to impose high-level control over the types of casesbrought under RICO, something he said government officials had beendoing all along.   ``The key point is that it is true that RICO was writtenprimarily with organized crime in mind,'' he said. ``However, thelegislative record is clear that Congress also intended to strikeat long-term systemic white-collar crime.''   Harvey Goldschmid, a securities law professor at ColumbiaUniversity Law School, played down the importance of thePrinceton-Newport sentences.   ``The sentences obviously reflects some sense of this groupsuffering a great deal,'' Goldschmid said. ``If I were on WallStreet, given the special circumstances here, I wouldn't take greatcomfort in the prospect that this, the relatively lenientsentences, will occur too often in the future.''</TEXT></DOC>
