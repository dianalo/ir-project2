Section 502(a)(2) of the Act requiressubmission of a report each year. Included in this report are sectionssummarizing rulemaking activities during 1988 and a discussion of the useof advanced automotive technology by the industry as required by Section305, Title III of the Department of Energy Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-238).Title V of the Act requires the Secretary of Transportation to administera program for regulating the fuel economy of new passenger cars and lighttrucks in the United States (U.S.) market. The authority to administerthe program has been delegated by the Secretary to the Administrator ofNHTSA, 49 CFR 1.50(f).NHTSA's responsibilities in the fuel economy area include: (1) Establishingand amending average fuel economy standards for manufacturers of passengercars and light trucks, as necessary; (2) promulgating regulations concerningprocedures, definitions, and reports necessary to support the fuel economystandards; (3) considering petitions for exemption from established fueleconomy standards by low volume manufacturers (those producing fewer thanl0,000 passenger cars annually worldwide) and establishing alternativestandards for them; (4) preparing reports to Congress annually on the fueleconomy program; (5) enforcing fuel economy standards and regulations;and (6) responding to petitions concerning domestic production by foreignmanufacturers and other matters.To date, passenger car fuel economy standards have been established bythe Congress for Model Years (MY's) 1978 through 1980 and for 1985 andthereafter, and by NHTSA for MY's 1981 through 1984. In addition, duringthe 1985 to 1988 period, NHTSA amended passenger car standards for MY's1986 through 1989. Standards for light trucks have been established byNHTSA for MY's 1979 through 1991. All current standards are listed in TableI-1.On October 14, 1988, the President signed the Alternate Motor Fuels Actof 1988, Pub. L. 100-494. This act amends the Motor Vehicle Informationand Cost Savings Act to provide special CAFE treatment for vehicles capableof using non-petroleum fuels in MY 1993 and thereafter. The intent of thisprovision is to encourage manufacturers to produce vehicles that can operateon alternate fuels.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table I-</T4>1._<T4>Fuel Economy Standards for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks Model Years</T4>1978<T4> Through </T4>1991 <T4>(MPG)</T4><H1>Model year</H1><H1>Passenger cars</H1><H1>Two-wheel drive</H1><H1>Light trucks \1\</H1><H2>Four-wheel drive</H2><H2>Combined \2\ \3\</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">1978<D>\4\ 18.0</D><D/><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1979<D>\4\ 19.0</D><D>17.2</D><D>15.8</D><D>17.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1980<D>\4\ 20.0</D><D>16.0</D><D>14.0</D><D>(\5\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1981<D>22.0</D><D>\6\ 16.7</D><D>15.0</D><D>(\5\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1982<D>24.0</D><D>18.0</D><D>16.0</D><D>17.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1983<D>26.0</D><D>19.5</D><D>17.5</D><D>19.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1984<D>27.0</D><D>20.3</D><D>18.5</D><D>20.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1985<D>\4\ 27.5</D><D>\7\ 19.7</D><D>\7\ 18.9</D><D>\7\ 19.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1986<D>\8\ 26.0</D><D>20.5</D><D>19.5</D><D>20.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1987<D>\8\ 26.0</D><D>21.0</D><D>19.5</D><D>20.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1988<D>\8\ 26.0</D><D>21.0</D><D>19.5</D><D>20.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1989<D>\8\ 26.5</D><D>21.5</D><D>19.0</D><D>20.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1990<D>\4\ 27.5</D><D>20.5</D><D>19.0</D><D>20.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1991<D>\4\ 27.5</D><D>20.7</D><D>19.1</D><D>20.2  </D><F>\1\ Standards for MY 1979 light trucks were established for vehicleswith a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 6,000 lbs. or less.

Overall fleet fuel economy improved for passenger cars from 28.4 mpg inMY 1987 to 28.7 mpg in MY 1988. Continued lower fuel prices during 1988contributed to the low demand for diesel engines (0.3 percent market sharefor MY 1987 and less than 0.1 percent for MY 1987). For MY 1988, CAFE valuesincreased over MY 1987 levels for 11 of 27 passenger car manufacturerswhich produced cars in both MY's 1987 and 1988. (See Table II-1.) These11 companies accounted for about 55 percent of the total MY 1988 production.Manufacturers continued to introduce new technologies and more fuel-efficientmodels, as well as some larger, less fuel-efficient imported cars. ForMY 1988, two domestic manufacturers raised their passenger car CAFE 0.7and 0.9 mpg from their MY 1987 levels, while one fell 0.4 mpg below itsMY 1987 CAFE level. Overall, the three domestic manufacturers increasedtheir combined CAFE by 0.3 mpg. The average CAFE for imported cars increased0.1 mpg in MY 1988 from the MY 1987 CAFE level.

manufacturers using the combined standard. Domestic light truckmanufacturers did not use the separate two-wheel drive or four-wheel drivestandards for MY 1988. The domestic total fleet CAFE remained the samefrom MY 1987 to MY 1988 for manufacturers using the combined standards.Graph II-2 illustrates the increase in total fleet CAFE from MY 1979 toMY 1988 for light trucks. Two domestic and two imported light truck manufacturers are projected tobe below the level of the MY 1988 CAFE standards. Also, a number of Europeanmanufacturers with limited model offerings are not projected to meet thelevel of the MY 1988 passenger car CAFE standard. However, NHTSA is notyet able to determine which of these manufacturers may be liable for civilpenalties for noncompliance. Some MY 1988 CAFE projections may change whenfinal MY 1988 CAFE figures are provided to NHTSA by EPA in mid-1989. Inaddition, many manufacturers are not expected to pay civil penalties becausethe credits they earned by exceeding the fuel econcmy standards in earlieryears offset subsequent shortfalls. Other manufacturers may file carrybackplans to demonstrate that they anticipate earning credits in future modelyears to eliminate current deficits. Fleet average fuel economy for all MY 1988 passenger cars exceeded boththe MY l988 standard and the higher 27.5 mpg standard originally set bythe Congress for MY's 1985 and beyond. Thus, even though NHTSA loweredthe original MY 1988 standard in accordance with statutory criteria, overallCAFE continued to rise. Fleet average fuel economy for MY 1988 light trucksalso exceeded the MY 1988 standards for both two- and four-wheel drivefleets and the combined basis.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4910-59-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 3 131</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4910-59-C   </ITAG>NHTSA estimates that by the year 2000 the projected cumulative passengercar and light truck fuel savings due to manufacturers, achievements throughcalendar year 1988 will amount to approximately 585 billion gallons, whencompared to the consumption projected at MY 1976 new vehicle fuel economylevels. This calculation assumes that manufacturers will continue to achievethe fuel economy levels of existing standards for the post-1990 periodand that on-road fuel economy averages 15 percent below EPA ratings, whichis consistent with current EPA labeling requirements. The characteristics of the MY 1988 passenger car fleet reflect a continuingtrend toward increased consumer demand for higher performance cars. (SeeTable II-3.) Since MY 1987, the average curb weight increased 43 poundsfor the domestic fleet and decreased 15 pounds for the import fleet, withthe total new passenger car fleet being 28 pounds heavier because of therelatively large share of domestic cars. From MY 1987 to MY 1988, horsepowerper 100 pounds increased 3.5 percent for domestic cars and 2 percent forimported cars. Average engine size remained the same for domestic carsand was slightly smaller for imported cars. The size class breakdown fordomestic cars shows a continued shift for MY 1988 to compact cars at theexpense of two-seater, subcompact, and mid-size cars. The shift of importcars to both the large and subcompact sizes is particularly pronounced.The import share of the passenger car market declined slightly in MY 1988,but large car exports increased to 2.8 percent of the import fleet in MY1988 from just 0.4 percent in MY 1987, indicating the importers' strategyof competing in what were market segments previously served almost exclusivelyby domestic manufacturers. The 0.3 mpg passenger car fuel economy improvement for the MY 1988 overalldomestic fleet may be attributed in part to mix shifts and in part to technologychanges in several areas: significant changes in engine design, a pronouncedincrease in the use of fuel injection and front wheel drive, and more automatictransmissions with lockup torque converters. The 0.1 mpg passenger car fuel economy increase for the MY 1988 importfleet is attributed to the substantial shift from compact to subcompactsize cars, a decrease in average curb weight, improved engine technology,and more use of front-wheel drive. These changes offset losses due to increasedapplication of automatic transmissions with less usage of lockup clutches,and more large cars. CAFE for the MY 1988 import passenger car fleet continuedto exceed 30.0 mpg for the eighth consecutive model year. The characteristics of the MY 1988 light truck fleet (see Table II-4) showan average weight increase of 90 pounds and higher performance as reflectedby the increase in the average horsepower to weight ratio. Increased popularityof large pickups and special purpose vehicles contributed to the 0.2 mpgfleet fuel economy decrease for MY 1988. There was a 20.5 percentage pointincrease in the use of fuel injection and a nearly 4 percentage point increasein the use of lockup torque converter clutches on automatic transmissions.Diesel engine usage declined in light trucks to 0.2 percent in MY 1988from 0.6 percent in MY 1987. The import share of the MY 1988 light truckfleet declined to 20.1 percent, 7.6 percentage points lower than in MYI987.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table II-</T4>3._<T4>Passenger Car Fleet Characteristics For MY's </T4>1987<T4> and </T4>1988<H1>Characteristics</H1><H1>Total fleet</H1><H2>1987</H2><H2>1988</H2><H1>Domestic fleet</H1><H2>1987</H2><H2>1988</H2><H1>Import fleet</H1><H2>1987</H2><H2>1988</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Fleet Average Fuel Economy, mpg<D>28.4</D><D>28.7</D><D>27.0</D><D>27.3</D><D>31.1</D><D>31.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fleet Average Curb Weight, lbs.<D>2,805</D><D>2,833</D><D>2,982</D><D>3,025</D><D>2,523</D><D>2,508</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fleet Average Engine Displacement, in.\3\<D>162</D><D>162</D><D>190</D><D>190</D><D>117</D><D>115</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fleet Average Horsepower/Weight ratio, HP/100 lbs.<D>3.98</D><D>4.12</D><D>4.03</D><D>4.18</D><D>3.91</D><D>3.99 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent of Fleet<D>100</D><D>100</D><D>61.5</D><D>61.9</D><D>38.5</D><D>38.1</D></ITAG><T3>Segmentation by EPA Size Class, percent:</T3><ITAG tagnum="2">Two-Seater<D>2.6</D><D>1.5</D><D>1.5</D><D>1.1</D><D>4.4</D><D>2.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Minicompact<D>1.0</D><D>0.9</D><D>0.0</D><D>0.0</D><D>2.7</D><D>2.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Subcompact*<D>20.0</D><D>21.0</D><D>7.8</D><D>6.7</D><D>39.2</D><D>45.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Compact*<D>40.1</D><D>41.0</D><D>33.7</D><D>39.9</D><D>50.0</D><D>43.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Mid-Size*<D>23.9</D><D>21.5</D><D>36.8</D><D>31.9</D><D>3.4</D><D>3.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Large*<D>12.5</D><D>13.8</D><D>20.1</D><D>20.2</D><D>0.4</D><D>2.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2"> Diesel Engines<D>0.3</D><D>0.01</D><D>0.1</D><D>0.0</D><D>0.6</D><D>0.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Turbocharged Engines<D>3.9</D><D>2.4</D><D>3.5</D><D>2.2</D><D>4.8</D><D>2.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Fuel Injection<D>72.0</D><D>80.9</D><D>82.4</D><D>93.6</D><D>56.0</D><D>59.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Front-Wheel Drive<D>74.9</D><D>82.6</D><D>68.8</D><D>79.1</D><D>84.6</D><D>88.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Automatic Transmissions<D>75.0</D><D>77.2</D><D>89.7</D><D>90.6</D><D>51.7</D><D>54.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Automatic Transmissions with Lockup Clutches or Split Torque Features<D>83.0</D><D>88.5</D><D>84.6</D><D>93.5</D><D>78.5</D><D>74.3</D><F>*Includes associated station wagons.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L2,i1,s100,5,5,5,5,5,5</C><T4>Table II-</T4>4._<T4>Light Truck Fleet Characteristics for MY's </T4>1987<T4> and </T4>1988<H1>Characteristics</H1><H1>Total fleet</H1><H2>1987</H2><H2>1988</H2><H1>2wd fleet</H1><H2>1987</H2><H2>1988</H2><H1>4wd fleet</H1><H2>1987</H2><H2>1988</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Fleet Average Fuel Economy, mpg<D>21.6</D><D>21.4</D><D>22.2</D><D>22.0</D><D>21.5</D><D>20.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fleet Average Equivalent Test Weight, lbs.<D>3,797</D><D>3,887</D><D>3,745</D><D>3,837</D><D>3,902</D><D>3,986</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fleet Average Engine Displacement, in.\3\<D>210</D><D>225</D><D>212</D><D>225</D><D>207</D><D>227</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fleet Average Horsepower/Equivalent Test Weight ratio, HP/100 lbs.<D>3.38</D><D>3.61</D><D>3.39</D><D>3.58</D><D>3.36</D><D>3.65</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent of Fleet<D>100</D><D>100</D><D>67.2</D><D>64.2</D><D>32.9</D><D>35.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Import Share, percent<D>27.7</D><D>20.1</D><D>25.0</D><D>18.8</D><D>36.1</D><D>28.6</D></ITAG><T3>Segmentation by Type, percent:</T3>Passenger Van:<ITAG tagnum="3">Compact</ITAG><D>14.6</D><D>6.2</D><D>21.1</D><D>9.3</D><D>1.5</D><D>0.5</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Large</ITAG><D>1.1</D><D>0.7</D><D>1.7</D><D>1.0</D><D/><D/>Cargo Van:<ITAG tagnum="3">Compact</ITAG><D>3.0</D><D>2.0</D><D>4.4</D><D>3.2</D><D>0.2</D><D/><ITAG tagnum="3">Large</ITAG><D>7.6</D><D>6.3</D><D>11.3</D><D>9.8</D><D/><ITAG tagnum="1">Small Pickup<D>29.0</D><D>23.8</D><D>35.8</D><D>30.8</D><D>15.1</D><D>11.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Large Pickup<D>21.9</D><D>28.4</D><D>20.4</D><D>27.1</D><D>25.1</D><D>31.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Special Purpose<D>22.5</D><D>31.8</D><D>5.0</D><D>17.9</D><D>58.1</D><D>57.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cab Chassis<D>0.3</D><D>0.6</D><D>0.4</D><D>0.9</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Diesel Engines<D>0.6</D><D>0.2</D><D>0.7</D><D>0.1</D><D>0.4</D><D>0.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fuel Injection<D>66.8</D><D>87.3</D><D>65.9</D><D>87.8</D><D>68.6</D><D>87.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Automatic Transmissions<D>60.3</D><D>63.6</D><D>65.7</D><D>67.7</D><D>49.4</D><D>56.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Automatic Transmissions with Lockup Clutches<D>77.6</D><D>81.5</D><D>76.8</D><D>80.9</D><D>79.6</D><D>84.2</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Section III: 1988 Activities  </ITAG>A. Petitions to Amend Passenger Car CAFE Standards On April 28, 1988, NHTSA published a denial of two petitions for rulemakingfiled by General Motors Corporation (GM) and Mercedes-Benz of North America,Inc. (Mercedes), seeking retroactive reductions in passenger car fuel economystandards. Mercedes asked the agency to reduce the model year l984 and1985 standards to 26.0 mpg or lower. GM asked the agency to reduce themodel year 1985 standard to 26.0 mpg or lower. As the agency explained, it based its denial on a determination that exercisingits discretion to amend retroactively would be inconsistent with the statutoryscheme of the Federal fuel economy law. Title V of the Motor Vehicle Informationand Cost Savings Act (53 FR 15241, at 15243, April 28, 1988). GM filed another petition on the same issue on May 27, 1988, after theApril 28, 1988 petition denial. GM indicated three bases for the agencyto consider again the retroactive amendment of the MY 1985 CAFE level,including the argument that NHTSA should agree to a ``one-time-only'' retroactiveamendment of the standard. The agency considered all of the arguments presentedby GM, but decided to deny the petition for rulemaking. NHTSA affirmedthe rationale of its original decision, and further concluded that an agencyexercise of discretion to issue a ``one-time-only'' retroactive amendmentwould not be consistent with the scheme of the CAFE statute (53 FR 39115,October 5, 1988). On November 22, 1988, GM filed a petition for judicialreview in the DC Circuit, U.S. Court of Appeals, of the agency's denialof its rulemaking petition.The agency also received petitions from the Automobile Importers of America,Inc. (AIA), Mercedes, GM, Austin Rover, and the Competitive EnterpriseInstitute (CEI) to lower passenger car fuel economy standards for MY's1989-1990. All petitions requested a reduction in the CAFE standards tobelow 27.5 mpg, with four of them requesting a lower standard based ontheir alleged inability to meet the statutorily set standard of 27.5 mpg.The petitions suggested various levels at which to set the standard, withthe lowest recommended level being 22 mpg. CEI requested a lower standardbased on the contention that the CAFE program has caused an increase inmotor vehicle fatalities.On August 29, 1988, NHTSA published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 33080) a notice of a public meeting tobe held on September 14, 1988, and a notice of a proposed rulemaking (NPRM)to amend the existing MY 1989-1990 standards of 27.5 mpg to values withinthe range of 26.5 mpg to 27.5 mpg. In the NPRM, the agency requested informationand comments to assist it in this analysis of manufacturers' fuel economycapabilities for MY's 1989-90. Comments were requested by September 15,1988 for MY 1989 and October 28, 1988 for MY 1990. On September 30, 1988, after receiving extensive comments on its proposaland holding a public reeting, NHTSA issued a final rule amending the MYI989 standard to 26.5 mpg (53 FR 39275, October 6, 1988). NHTSA determinedthat 26.5 mpg was the ``maximum feasible'' average fuel economy level afterbalancing the statutory criteria of economic practicability, technologica1feasibility, the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards and theneed of the nation to conserve energy. On October 27, 1988, the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filela petition for judicial review of the MY 1989 standard in the U.S. Courtof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. GM, Ford, and AIA havefiled petitions to intervene in that suit. NRDC's petition is addressedsolely to alleged violations of the National Environmental Policy Act of1969. On November 28, 1988, the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI)filed a petition for review of the MY 1989 Standard in the District ofColumbia Circuit. CEI asserts that the standard was set too high, citingsafety concerns. On November 7, 1988, the Center for Auto Safety and Public Citizen jointlysubmitted a petition for administrative reconsideration of the MY 1989standard. The petition addressed various issues arising under the fueleconomy provisions (Title V) of the Motor Vehicle and Information CostSavings Act. [On May 23, 1989, NHTSA denied the petition (54 FR 22899;May 30, 1989).] [On May 16, 1989, NHTSA terminated rulemaking with respect to the MY 1990standard (54 FR 21985; May 22, 1989). NHTSA stated that the decision reflectedthe increasing need of the nation to conserve energy and the agency's conclusionthat retention of the 27.5 mpg standard for MY 1990 would not have a significantadverse effect on U.S. employment or on the competitiveness of the U.S.auto industry due in part, to the availability of credits from past years.]B. Light Truck Standards NHTSA published a final rule establishing MY 1990 and 1991 light truckfuel economy standards on April 5, 1988 (53 FR 11074). The agency set acombined standard of 20.0 mpg for MY 1990; with optional standards of 20.5mpg for two-wheel drive (2WD) trucks and 19.0 mpg for four-wheel drive(4WD) trucks. For MY I99l, the combined standard was established at 20.2mpg; and optional standards are 20.7 mpg for 2WD trucks and 19.1 for 4WDtrucks. In the final rule for MY 1990 and 1991 trucks, the agency determined thatFord is the ``least capable'' manufacturer for both years with a combinedfuel economy capability of 20.0 mpg for MY 1990 and 20.2 mpg for MY 1991.GM is the least capable manufacturer for 4WD trucks for both years, withprojected nominal CAFE levels of 19 mpg for MY 1990 and 19.1 mpg for MY1991. For 2WD trucks, Ford is the least capable manufacturer with a rangeof 20.3 mpg to 20.7 mpg for both model years.The agency concluded, upon balancing the relevant statutory factors, thatthe relatively small and uncertain energy savings that would be associatedwith setting a standard above Ford or GM's capability would not justifythe economic harm to the companies and the economy as a whole. The agencyprojected that Ford could achieve a combined fuel economy level no higherthan 20.0 mpg for MY 1990 and 20.2 mpg for MY 199l and GM no higher than20.4 mpg for MY's 1990 and 1991. A 20.4 mpg optimistic projection for MY1990 by Ford could drop to as low as 19.9 mpg, if all potential risks arerealized. The 20.4 mpg figure projected by GM was also subject to risks, these beinga potential loss of 0.4 mpg due to mix-shift risk resulting from lowergas prices and shifts towards larger trucks and engines for MY's 1990 and1991. The agency selected 20.0 mpg for MY 1990 and 20.2 mpg for MY 1991 as thefinal combined standards to balance the potentially serious adverse economicconsequences associated with the realization of the above market and technologicalrisks against Ford and GM's opportunities as the ``least capable'' manufacturerswith a substantial share of sales. Since Ford and GM produce more than52 percent of all light trucks subject to the fuel economy standards, theircapabilities have a significant effect on the level of the industry's capabilityand, therefore, on the level of the standards. C. Low Volume Petitions Section 502(c) of the Act provides that a low volume manufacturer of passengerautomobiles may be exempted from the generally applicable passenger carfuel economy standards if these standards are more stringent than the maximumfeasible average fuel economy for that manufacturer and if NHTSA establishesan alternative standard for that manufacturer at its maximum feasible level.Under the Act, a low volume manufacturer is one that manufactured fewerthan 10,000 passenger automobiles, worldwide, in the model year for whichthe exemption is sought (the affected model year) and in the second modelyear before the affected model year. The agency has pending petitions for alternative standards from Lamborghini,Lotus, Maserati, LondonCoach, Ferrari, Bitter, Shelby, Dutcher Motors,Rolls-Royce, ASC Inc., and Prototype Automotive Services. Some manufacturerspreviously eligible for alternative fuel economy standards may not be eligiblefor future model years as a result of acquisitions or other relationshipswith larger manufacturers. In addition, the agency has received inquiriesconcerning eligibility to file for low volume exemption by certain smallimporters/manufacturers. D. Carryback Plans Section 502(1) of the Act allows an automobile manufacturer to earn fueleconomy credits during any model year in which the manufacturer's fleetexceeds the established CAFE standard. The amount of credits a manufacturerearns is determined by multiplying the number of tenths of a mile per gallonby which the average fuel economy of the manufacturer's fleet in the modelyear exceeds the standard by the total number of vehicles in the manufacturer'sfleet for the model year. Already earned fuel economy credits are carried forward by the agency,(with affected manufacturers given an opportunity to comment on the agency'sallocation of credits) and distributed to any of the three succeeding modelyears in which the manufacturer's fleet falls below the CAFE standard.For example, credits earned in MY 1983 have been used to offset deficienciesin MY 1984, 1985, and/or 1986. A manufacturer also may submit to the agencya carryback plan, which demonstrates that it will earn sufficient creditswithin the following three model years which can be allocated to meet theCAFE standard in the model year involved. Ford submitted a carryback plan on January 13, 1988, for MY 1985 lighttruck Cafe compliance. Ford's carryback plan was approved. Ford also submitteda carryback plan on July 28, 1988, requesting that credits earned by itsMY 1988 import passenger car fleet, which includes cars from its recently-acquiredAston Martin Lagonda subsidiary, be carried back to satisfy penalties foreither of the predecessor fleets that accrue from MY's 1985-1987. E. Enforcement Notice letters for shortfalls in MY 1986 for most affected manufacturerswere distributed after the disposition of Center for Auto Safety v. Thomasby the DC Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. This case involved a challengeto an EPA rule adopting a new methodology for calculating automobile fuelefficiency. After a rehearing <T3>en banc, </T3>the case was dismissed because a majority of the fullcourt did not find that the petitioners had standing to sue. This decisionhad the effect of reinstating the challenged EPA rule. On May 3, 1988, the agency's complaint counsel commenced an enforcementaction against Mercedes-Benz of North America (MBNA) to collect the $5,509,400in civil penalties owed for MY 1985. On December 29, 1988, a DOT administrativelaw judge issued an initial decision concluding that MBNA could not challengethe agency's decision not to retroactively amend the MY 1984 and 1985 standardsin that administrative enforcement proceeding, and that MBNA was liablefor the full amount claimed. [MPNA has appealed that initial decision tothe Administrator.] Also on December 29, 1988, MBNA paid the $5,509,400 that NHTSA claimedwas due, on condition that if the civil penalty were ultimately reducedNHTSA will refund the difference. On the same date MBNA paid NHTSA $20,214,700it owed for its non-compliance with the MY 1986 standard. F. Technology Studies A study of low tension piston rings and roller cam followers for enginefriction reduction was performed. U.S. major automobile manufacturers weresurveyed to determine the state of the art of these technologies. Manufacturingcosts and fuel economy benefits were evaluated. These approaches were foundto be effective, and details of the methodology and costs are discussedin a final report entitled: ``Low Tension Piston Rings and Roller Cam Followersfor Engine Friction Reduction-Costs of Retooling and Fuel Economy Benefits''.The report is being made available to the public through the National TechnicalInformation Service.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section IV: Use of Advanced Technology  </ITAG>This section fulfills the statutory requirement of Section 305 of TitleIII of the Department of Energy Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-238) which directsthe Secretary of Transportation to submit an annual report to Congresson the use of advanced technologies by the automotive industry to improvemotor vehicle fuel economy. This report focuses on the introduction ofnew models, the application of materials to save weight, and the advancesin electronic technology which improved fuel economy in MY 1988. <T3>New Models. </T3>In 1988, ranufacturers introduced more aerodynamicmodels and new front-wheel drive (FWD) cars and some more aerodynamic,lighter-weight trucks. The domestic automakers introduced several all-new cars as well as updatesof previous cars. GM proJuced the new mid-size GM10 FWD cars in three models:The Buick Regal, the Pontiac Grand Prix and the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.GM designed more-rounded lines for its compact J-body Chevrolet Cavalier,Pontiac Sunbird, Oldsmobile Firenza, and Buick Skyhawk. Chrysler introducedfour all-new FWD cars for the 1988 model year: the midsize C-body ChryslerNew Yorker and New Yorker Landau, the Dodge Dynasty, and the Jeep EagleDivision's Premier. Ford introduced the completely redesigned Continental,featuring FWD for the first time. It weighs 170 pounds less than its rear-drivepredecessor, but is 0.5 inches longer in wheelbase and has more interiorroom. Ford also introduced, as an early 1989 model, the sporty Probe, producedby Mazda at its new Flat Rock, MI, assembly plant in conjunction with theMazda MX-6. Ford emphasized aerodynamics in its restyling of the Tempo/Topazand Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis models. Automobile imorters introduced a variety of new cars and updates to theircurrent models. Mazda's first luxury car for the U.S. market, the 929 rear-wheeldrive sedan, debuted with the firm's first V-6 overhead cam, 18 valve 3-literengine. Mazda also introduced a restyled 626 compact sedan and hatchbackand began production of the MX-6 model at its U.S. assembly plant. Mercedesintroduced two gasoline-powered models, the midsize 300CE hardtop, andalso the 300TE wagon and the S-class 300 SEL, replacing the diesel 300TDand 300 SDL, respectively. BMW introduced the 750iL powered by a 295-hp5-liter V-l2 engine, an all-wheel drive 325iX, a sporty 535iS, and a performanceoriented M5 model. Ihe 1.6 liter 26-valve 4-cylinder Toyota Corolla enteredthe market in 1988. Ihe engine uses scissor gears to position the camshaftscloser to each other for a smaller valve angle. Toyota also revived thesupercharger with the new 1.6 liter 16-valve MR2 engine with better fueleconomy during low and midrange operation. The Nissan Pulsar 1.8 literengine was replaced with a port-injected 1.8 liter 16-valve engine. Nissanalso introduo.i a lighter weight Garrett T-25 high-flow turbocharger onthe 300ZX to improve low-end response. Mitsubishi introduced an early 1989FWD Galant model that is smaller than the Galant Sigma and offers a 16-valveengine with low friction roller cam followers, 4-speed automatic transmission,and an ``active'' suspension that modifies spring rates and ride heightsfor various driving conditions. Some other newcomers include the subcompactFord Festiva frcm South Korea and the compact Mexican-built Mercury Tracer.In the domestic light truck area, GM's redesignated C/K pickups improvedthe average fuel economy by 0.8 mpg over 1987 pickups (<T3>Automotive Engineering, </T3>February 1988), by enhancing the aerodynamicsand reducing weight. GM's new manual HM 290 transmission introduced on2WD and 4WD light duty trucks improved fuel economy through low-frictionccmponents and low viscosity lubricants. GM offered an optional 4.3-literV-6 in the S-10/S-15 lineup, the biggest engine in the compact pickup field.<T3>Engine Technology. </T3>Some manufacturers rade significant changesto the engines in their 1988 models. Both Chrysler's 2.2 and 2.5 liter,4 cylinder powerplants have roller camshaft followers, which improve idlequality and fuel economy at low speeds and when idling. City cycle fueleconomy for both engines increased 4% with the automatic and 3% with manualtransaxle. Ford used fuel injection Ford installed the fuel injection systemson all gasoline powered light trucks, with the exception of the 2.0-literengine offered on the Ranger S. GM enlarged its Cadillac 4.1-liter V-8engine to 4.5-liters of displacement, increasing horsepower and torqueby 20%, without increasing fuel consumption in most applications. The GM3.8-liter engine was extensively redesigned for reduced internal frictionand smoothness, resulting in an engine with more power and accelerationas well as improved fuel economy and lcwer emissions. The all-new 16-valueQuad 4 engine was optional in all GM compact N-cars: The Oldsmobile Calais,Pontiac Grand AM and Buick Skylark. Multi-valve engine designs such asthe Quad 4 offer the potential for both improved performance and improvedfuel economy. For 1988, 3- and 4-valve engines were offered on an arrayof imported cars including the Austin Rover Sterling, Saab 9000, JaquarXJ6, BMW M-5, Nissan Pulsar, scme Mazdas and Chevrolet Novas, and mostHondas and Ioyotas. <T3>New Material Applications. </T3>For the 1988 model year, automakerschose plastics, aluminum, and stainless steel for a number of significantnew component applications in their cars, vans, and pickup trucks. GM's Buick Reatta is the second car designed and built in the U.S. to usethermoplastic fenders. The first was the 1987 Buick LeSabre T-type. Fordexpanded the use of all-plastic bumpers on the Ford Escort and Tempo andMercury Topaz in MY 1988. Another important new application for plasticswas the use of blow-molded high-density polyethylene fuel tanks on 1988Chrysler Eagle Premier cars. Ihe plastic tanks weigh approximately 30 percentless than conventional terne-plated steel tanks. A significant new applicationfor plastics was the integrated rear fender/sidestep/taillamp molding forthe Sportside versions of GM's large pickup truck. Additional new applicationsof plastics included the urethane bumper fascias on Chrysler's New Yorkerand Dynasty models, as well as those on GM's new GM10 cars. GM's Quad 4 engine featured an aluminum cylinder head, camshaft carrierand ignition oover. The Quad 4 engine used aluminum pistons and aluminumtuned tubular intake manifolds. Other significant new aluminum applicationsinclude the reinforcement bars on bumper systems for Chrysler C-cars, oilpans and rocker covers on Chrysler's Eagle Premier cars, radiators usedin some GM mid-size cars, heater cores in most 1988 Fords, and cylinderblocks and heads on the European-built V-6 engine option for the EaglePremier. New uses for stainless steel included exhaust ranifolds on GM's Quad 4engine and exhaust pipes, intermediate pipes, mufflers and tailpipes onChrysler C-cars. Fire rings in the cylinder head gaskets on several ofGM's V-6 and V-8 engines were also made of stainless steel in the 1988model year, as were the foil substrates, or liners, in some GM catalyticconverters. <T3>Electronics. </T3>Application of electronic components that increasefuel economy in vehicles continues to rise. There is a worldwidw growthrate of 18% per year in vehicle electronics, not including audio. Electronicshas had its biggest success in two main areas engine controls and comfort/convenienceitems. Electronics were vital in reducing exhaust emission, and electronicfuel injection has all but taken over from carburetors. Cars of the futuremay use three different ccmputers to control functions: One for engineand transmission; one for instrumentation and interior functions, includingclimate control; and one combining suspension, steering and anti-lock brakes.Market projections call for an average value of $2,000 per car in electronicscontent by 1990. Summary Due to the stabilization of oil prices and supply, consumer demand in MY1988 shifted slightly to more powerful and larger passenger cars and lighttrucks. The auto industry, responding to this shift, has increased thehorsepower of its engines and shifted production mix causing an increasein average weight of MY 1988 passenger cars. Still, there were some considerabletechnical gains, particularly in engine design, that contributed to improvementsin fuel economy in MY 1988.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-16715 Filed 7-18-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4910-59-M</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
