It said insurgents brought the Antonov-32 transport downWednesday with a U.S.-built Stinger missile. The plane carried 12passengers and four crew members, according to the Kabul radioreport.   Among the passengers were two brigadier generals, MohammedIsmail Noori and Abdul Ahad Razmenda, and Col. Mohammed HassanKoshyar, political affairs director for military forces in theKunduz region, the radio said. It described Razmenda as a DefenseMinistry lawyer.   The plane was bound from Kabul to Kunduz City, 160 milesnortheast of Kabul near the Soviet border, the broadcast said.   Major battles between guerrillas and Soviet and Afghan forceshave been reported in the Kunduz area. Warplanes flying from Sovietterritory bombed insurgent positions late last month.   The Soviet-made An-32 is a twin-engined turboprop that can carry39 passengers, 30 paratroopers or 24 stretchers, and is built forshort runways.   Soviet soldiers began withdrawing from Afghanistan May 15 undera U.N.-mediated agreement and half the estimated 115,000 had leftby Aug. 15. All are to be gone by Feb. 15, 1989.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in December1979. The insurgents were not a party to the agreement reachedApril 14 in Geneva and have continued fighting.   A separate Kabul radio report said two of Pakistan's U.S.-builtF-16 jet fighters intruded into Afghan air space over Asmar ineastern Kumar province on a reconnaissance mission Wednesday.   It also quoted the government as denying Pakistan's report thatan Afghan warplane was shot down Wednesday in Pakistani air space.   Pakistan said Wednesday that four Afghan warplanes flew over itsterritory near Nawagai, 12 miles from the border and one was downedby Pakistani fighters.   In Geneva, a U.N. official said Afghan refugees will be trainedto dispose of mines left by Soviet and Afghan government forces,which are estimated to number from hundreds of thousands tomillions.   The proposed program by the U.N. office coordinating aid forAfghanistan also calls for public information campaigns to warnwomen and children returning to the country about mines.   ``The first step is to train one or two returnees per village tohave some idea of how to defuse a mine and dispose of it,'' saidthe official, an aide to the chief of the Geneva-based office,Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan. He spoke on condition of anonymity.   More than 5 million Afghans have fled the country since the warbegan and nearly all live in Pakistan and Iran, Afghanistan'seastern and western neighbors. The Geneva agreement includesprovisions for their return.</TEXT></DOC>
