Up to now the discussion has been dominated by one big irrelevancy, the neglect of one important relevancy and the strong assertion of doubtful propositions.    The irrelevancy is the question whether rich people get more capital gains than poor people. That is irrelevant because it mixes up two quite different questions. The first is how much rich people should be taxed. The second is how a particular kind of income should be taxed.    If we want rich people to be taxed more, we have an efficient means to achieve that -- namely, the income-tax rate schedule. If reducing the tax on capital gains is a good thing on other grounds, the fact that some rich people would benefit disproportionately would not be an argument against it. Opponents of a cut in the capital-gains tax weaken their logical and moral case by resorting to the demagogic argument that the cut would mainly benefit rich people.    The real argument on equity grounds against cutting the capital-gains tax is not that it would benefit the rich, but that it would leave some people paying less tax than other people with the same income. It is inequitable to reduce the tax on a person who earns a million dollars of capital gains -- not because he is rich, but because the reduction leaves him paying less tax than a person who earns a million dollars playing basketball, and who is also rich. (In Washington we still consider a person who earns a million dollars to be rich.)    Although the distribution of gains by income levels is irrelevant to the equity of the case, it is not, of course, irrelevant to the politics of the case -- that is, to explaining why the idea of cutting the capital-gains tax seems irresistible. Public-choice theorists have shown us that a cause that is intensely desired by a minority will generally prevail over the tepid objections of a majority. And that will be especially true if the minority is rich.    The relevant fact that is being ignored is that capital gains already are taxed less than most other forms of income. That is because the tax on capital gains is deferred until the gains are realized and the gains are permanently relieved of income tax if the owner dies without realizing them. The gain from deferral is simply a reflection of the fact that a dollar today is worth more than the promise of a dollar in the future.    The following example illustrates the point: Suppose a person in the 28% income bracket invests $1,000 in an asset that yields 10% interest every year. Each year he earns 10% interest, pays tax of 28% on that and reinvests the remainder. At the end of 10 years he has $2,004.23. Now suppose another person invests $1,000 in an asset that pays no interest but rises in value by 10% each year. At the end of 10 years his asset is worth $2,593.74 and he sells it. He pays 28% tax on the gain of $1,593.74 and is left with $2,147.49, or over 7% more than the interest earner. It is as if he had paid an annual tax of 20.57% rather than 28%. The longer he holds the asset and the higher the interest rate, the more this deferral is worth.    The value of deferring tax payments makes the common proposal to reduce the capital-gains tax more on assets held for a long time than on assets held for a short time incomprehensible. The tax already is lower on assets held for a long time. Presumably the preference for long holding periods is supposed to appeal to the popular prejudice against speculation -- which is only that, a prejudice. Sometimes the argument is made that giving a preference for long-held assets encourages long-term thinking. This reflects a confusion, common in all kinds of discussion these days, among what may be called holding, valuation and fruition.    Suppose that on Jan. 1, 1990, I start an enterprise to develop a radically different software program. I believe that after research, development, testing, engineering and penetration of the market the enterprise will begin to make a lot of money in the year 2000. Fruition will not come until then. But if investors in the market become aware by July 1, 1990, that this enterprise is going to make a lot of money 10 years later, the value of the company will jump at once, not wait until 2000. That will be the time of valuation. I could take my gain on July 2, 1990, or in 2000, or at any other time. The length of my holding period will tell nothing about how &quot;long-term&quot; my thinking was.    A lower rate of tax on capital gains is often justified as a way to increase investment, particularly in &quot;risk-taking.&quot; Presumably, that is what lies behind the claim that cutting the tax will raise economic growth.    This proposition needs to be divided into two parts. One is that the tax change will increase total investment. To do that it must increase total saving. It will increase the after-tax return on saving invested in forms most likely to yield capital gains. But this is a weak reed to lean much weight upon. Whether increasing the after-tax return to saving in general increases saving, whether increasing the after-tax return to a particular kind of saving increases saving in total, whether increasing the after-tax return to this particular kind of saving is more effective in increasing saving than is increasing the after-tax return to other kinds of saving or to saving in total -- all are unanswered questions.    Particular attention is given to &quot;risk-taking.&quot; But I never hear any discussion of the question, &quot;What's so great about risk-taking, after all?&quot; People love to point to the marvelous successes of some risk-taking enterprises. But the essence of risk-taking is that it also involves some marvelous losses, which we never hear about.    If we compare two potential investments, one that promises to yield a sure 10% and one that promises equal possibilities of a 30% gain and a 10% loss, is there any reason for public policy to prefer the latter? Is there any reason to think that investors are &quot;too risk-averse&quot;? A good tax system would neither prefer nor penalize risk-taking. The chief implication of that for the taxation of capital gains is the need to provide more liberal deduction of capital losses. Even the case for this probably has been reduced by the development of financial institutions that can diversify and offset losses with gains.    What greases the path for cutting the capital-gains tax today is the apparent need for revenue today coupled with the belief that cutting the tax will increase the revenue. This subject has been hashed over a great deal. I think that the conclusions are inescapable. No one knows with confidence what the revenue effect of cutting the rate would be. Viewed in relation to the revenues and revenue needs of the federal government over a long period of time, the net effect, whether plus or minus, is most probably negligible. Only the fact that we now look at the federal budget one year at a time, and often it seems one month at a time, makes the revenue consequences at all interesting.    Finally, we come to the only clearly valid part of the case for &quot;reform&quot; of the capital-gains tax. That is the fact that with inflation, the present tax imposes very high taxes on real gains. Thus, if an asset rises by 10% in a year, when prices rise by 5%, a tax of 28% on the nominal gain is a tax of approximately 56% on the real gain. Two points must be made about this, however:    a) If the real gain is large relative to the inflation rate, and if the holding period is long, the value of deferring the tax will exceed the excess burden due to the inflation.    b) The taxation of nominal interest earnings in a period of inflation imposes a similar excess burden. In the simplest case, if you have a savings account paying 5% interest in a period of 5% inflation you are paying an infinite tax on your zero real income.    Indexing capital gains for inflation would probably be a reform. One has to say &quot;probably&quot; because the tax system is so full of anomalies and inequalities that one cannot be sure that correcting one will not worsen others. If indexing is what comes out of Congress this year it probably will be a gain, offsetting the cost of the public miseducation and disinformation that has been released on this subject during the past two years.    ---   A former chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Stein is an American Enterprise Institute fellow. </TEXT></DOC>
