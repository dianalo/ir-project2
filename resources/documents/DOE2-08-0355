Measurements have been made by scattering 59.54-keV {gamma}rays. Theoretical computations have been carried out with use of therenormalized-free-atom model for various 4d-5s configurations. Best agreementbetween theory and experiment is found if the electron configurationis chosen as 4d{sup 3}5s{sup 1}.</TEXT></DOC>
