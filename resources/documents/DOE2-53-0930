Two different hydrothermal mineral assemblages are structurallylocalized in the detachment environment: I) chlorite + specularite +pyrite + chalcopyrite form replacements in the immediate vicinity ofthe detachment fault and tangentially-intersecting listric faults, andII) hematite + sericite + chrysocolla +/- gold, barite, and calcite occurat structurally higher positions in tear faults and the listric faultswhich they transect. Fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures indicatehotter conditions of formation for assemblage I (225-300{sup 0}C) thanthe assemblage II minerals (150-225{sup 0}C). Inclusion salinities forboth groups are in the approximate range 12-20 weight percent NaCl equivalent.Mineral stability calculations indicate transport of metals for bothenvironments was by chloride complexes in moderately acidic solutionswhich can be shown to contain comparable concentrations of total dissolvedsulfur. It is likely that the fluids depositing both assemblages werederived from the same source, probably graben-related basins formed bythe same extensional tectonics as were the detachment faults. The presenceof gold with the assemblage II mineralization results from the increasedtransport capacity of more oxidized fluids circulating at generally higherlevels in the upper detachment plate, and deposition as a result of reductionby earlier-formed chlorite.</TEXT></DOC>
