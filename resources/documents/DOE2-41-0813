There are several major assumptionson which this program is based, such as: consumers do not make correctenergy efficiency decisions in appliance purchases due to lack of information;and, competitive pressures from from knowledgeable consumers will resultin manufacturers improving their appliances' energy efficiency. The purposeof this report is to evaluate the validity of these assumptions on thebasis of available information. To the extent that present informationis inefficient, the report points out what additional information isnecessary and possible ways of obtaining it; in particular, it investigatesother possible reasons for the alleged inefficiency and its possibleinteraction with informational deficiencies. The optimal way to proceedwith the Energuide Program is also examined. It is concluded that consumersappear to apply extremely high discount rates in calculating tradeoffsbetween operating cost savings and capital costs, possibly because oflack of energy efficiency information, ignorance on how to perform thecorrect calculations, and lack of concern about energy costs. There isno direct information on the effect of Energuide on consumer appliancepurchases, and only anecdotal information on introduction of energy efficientmodels by manufacturers. It is felt that there is not enough informationto perform a cost benefit analysis for Energuide or for an alternativesuch as a mandatory standards program. A number of additional studiesto resolve information gaps are proposed. 11 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
