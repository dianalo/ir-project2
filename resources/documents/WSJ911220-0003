Woods Jr.,awaiting trial on 14-month-old fraud charges, was indicted onseparate fraud charges relating to a $3.6 million loan.   The new indictment, handed up by a federal grand jury lastweek, is unusual because few defendants in thrift-fraud caseshave been charged with new crimes, even when defendants havereceived relatively light sentences in the original cases.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Woods, former owner of the defunct Western SavingsAssociation, is scheduled for trial Feb. 3 on charges that hediverted proceeds from Western Savings loans to cover uplosses on other loans at the thrift. In one instance,according to the October 1990 indictment, Mr. Woods isaccused of using funds from a thrift unit to pay off agambling debt.   The new charges accuse Mr. Woods of attempting to hidelosses on a piece of real estate near Houston by having theproperty purchased by a trust established for his daughter.The allegedly falsified purchase was financed with a $3.6million loan from Western Savings, but the trust wasn'trequired to repay that loan, according to the indictment.   Federal thrift regulators took over Western Savings in1986. In a lawsuit pending in federal court here, theregulators attribute at least half of Western's more than $1billion in losses to Mr. Woods's lending practices.   Mr. Woods's lawyer, Shirley Baccus-Lobel of Dallas,declined to comment on the indictments. Court records showthat Ms. Baccus-Lobel has asked U.S. District Judge Robert B.Maloney to try the two cases together. Prosecutors from theU.S. Justice Department's Dallas bank fraud task force areexpected to oppose consolidation of the cases.</TEXT></DOC>
