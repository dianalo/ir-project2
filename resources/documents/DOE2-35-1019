We preparedGaAs(280{mu}m) and ultrathin Si (50{mu}m) cells as samples and irradiatedthem to electron over the energy range of 0.3 MeV - 3.0 MeV. Using theseresults, we derived the relative damage coefficients reffering to normalincident 0.92 MeV electron on bare cell. This result shows shield effectof cover glass in low energy. Then we exposed solar cells to Co-60 gammaray and obtained the relation between gamma ray dose D and electron fluencePHI. We assumed the relational equation PHI = aD/sup b/ and obtainedthe coefficients a,b. In the result, coefficient a depends on the electronenergy and b is nearby equal to 1.</TEXT></DOC>
