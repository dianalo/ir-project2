The decision Monday by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsreversed a judge's ruling in Topeka's favor.   Only participants in the case got copies. The ruling wasexpected to be released to the general public later today.   But Patrick Fisher, deputy chief clerk of the appeals court,said the court ruled some elements of segregation still exist inthe Topeka school system, and it sent the case back to federalcourt in Kansas to come up with a remedy.   The appeals court recognized that Topeka has made progress inrecent years but said that the school system is engaged in ``benignneglect'' and is not meeting the court's requirements, Fisher said.   The ruling could jeopardize federal funds coming into thedistrict.   The appeals court had issued a similar ruling in the case June 2but withdrew the decison the following month without explanation.   Both sides in the case said Monday they would study the rulingbefore announcing their next move.   The original lawsuit challenged a Kansas law authorizing schoolsegregation. The 1954 Supreme Court decision striking down the lawpaved the way for nationwide school desegregation.   In 1979, however, the case was revived by black parents whoclaimed Topeka had failed to segregate its schools. The plaintiffsincluded Linda Brown Buckner, who was a youngster when her namewent on the original lawsuit 25 years ago.   U.S. District Judge Richard Rogers ruled in 1987 that remainingracial imbalances in Topeka's schools were the result of housingpatterns, not school board action.</TEXT></DOC>
