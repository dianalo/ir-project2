The small core size results in an extremelyhigh axial peaking factor detrimental to core performance. A spatialpoison zoning technique was implemented to flatten power density andburnup profiles, which in turn allows almost complete burnable poisonburnout at end of cycle. Separation of the cooling and moderating functionsof the water was achieved by tightening the fuel assembly lattice withsimultaneous increase of the interassembly gap. Thus, the hot-to-coldcomponent of the total reactivity control requirement is decreased. Designof the control rod system with different compositions and geometriesfor various control rod banks was investigated in order to satisfy-relatedlimitations on the reactivity worth of a single control rod.</TEXT></DOC>
