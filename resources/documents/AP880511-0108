The army command today said it was pleased with the response ofPalestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip to a potentially explosivecampaign to issue new identity cards to the area's 400,000 adults.   Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel hasoccupied since 1967, began demonstrating against the occupationlast Dec. 8. According to U.N. figures, 185 Palestinians have diedin the five months of violence. An Israeli soldier and a Jewishteen-age settler also have been killed.   ``The uprising has made the Palestinian problem a central issuein the world,'' said the leaflet distributed in the occupied landsand in Arab east Jerusalem, which was annexed by Israel. ``Theuprising is becoming a ghost which scares the enemy.''   It urged ``a complete boycott of the Zionists'' and asks thepeople to ``ready themselves for civil disobedience by storing foodin houses, enough for at least a month.''   In Jerusalem and its suburbs, police and soldiers began roundingup journalists and community leaders at about 1 a.m. (6 p.m. EDTTuesday), according to Arab reports.   At least 11 people were seized, including two editors of thepro-Palestine Liberation Organization newspaper Al Fajr, which hasbecome a voice of the uprising. Four other journalists werearrested, along with a union leader, head of a youth council, andseveral other Palestinians, the reports said.   The army refused to comment on the reports.   Israel radio reported that 47 people have been charged withmanslaughter in the death of man who allegedly collaborated withIsraeli authorities. The victim, Mohammed Id Sakanda, was lynchedby a mob in the village of Qabatiye in the West Bank in February.   Today, soldiers with loudspeakers ordered West Bank merchants toclose their shops in the morning but said they could open any timeafter noon.   The move is part of a continued effort to force storekeepers tooperate at times dictated by the army, not by uprising leaders whohave ordered repeated general strikes.   The new leaflet, the 16th issued by the United Leaders of theUprising, called for demonstrations on the Moslem holy day, Friday,and a general strike and ``day of anger'' next Sunday.   It also urged protests on Id el Fitr, the end of the Moslemfasting month of Ramadan, which is expected to be Monday or Tuesdaywhen the new moon is sighted. It also urged a general strike on May21.   The leaflet called on Palestinians to keep refusing to pay taxesto Israel and to refuse to obtain new government identity cards.   The army began a campaign on Tuesday to force 400,000 residentsof the Gaza Strip to get new cards, a move that protest leaders sayis aimed at catching tax evaders and breaking the five-monthuprising.   ``The first day of the program to issue new identification cardspassed very well,'' an army spokesman told The Associated Press oncondition of anonymity. ``There were no incidents and 2,000 peoplereceived new cards.''   The army has outlined a month-long first phase encompassing200,000 adults between the ages of 16 to 60 in Gaza City.   The government also has been pushing to collect back taxes andother lapsed fees.   Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising issued leafletsand had broadcast warnings from mosque loudspeakers urgingresidents not to cooperate with the army. They charge the IDprogram is a plot to break the Palestinian uprising, a main tacticof which is nonpayment of taxes.   The left-wing daily Al Hamishmar today issued a scathingeditorial of the army plan, saying the army might be trying to putpressure on the families of young Palestinian protesters by denyingtheir parents the new card.   It could create ``a layer of `cardless' residents who will beillegal residents in an area where they live and even were born.''   Jewish settlers, meanwhile, reacted angrily to charges by thechief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, that they were aggravatingtensions in the occupied territories.   Shomron angered Jewish settlers on Tuesday when he told aparliamentary committee the settlers were raising tensions in theoccupied lands.   ``It's as if he would say the residents of Israel's northernborder were responsible for the Katyusha rockets fired at them(from Lebanon),'' said Benny Katzover, a leader of Gush Emunim, areligious settlement movement. ``The Arabs want to throw us out ofall of the Land of Israel.''</TEXT></DOC>
