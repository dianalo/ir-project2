The United States ordered embassy dependents to leave thecountry, one day after Chinese soldiers, saying they were lookingfor a sniper, sprayed a diplomatic compound with gunfire.   Trucks, many piled high with supplies, rolled into centralTiananmen Square for more than an hour Thursday. Some carried troopswith rifles aimed at people bicycling along the road. It was notimmediately known whether these were the same troops, the 27th Army,that left the city in two large convoys Wednesday.   The 27th was responsible for killing and wounding thousands ofpeople when it stormed the city Saturday to wrest control ofTiananmen from students demonstrating for democratic reforms. U.S.intelligence estimates put the death toll at 3,000.   Beijing is also surrounded by armies said to oppose the harshmartial law crackdown, setting the stage for a possible battlebetween rival military factions. Reports surfaced of skirmishesbetween soldiers, but no serious clashes.   Diplomats estimate 200,000 soldiers from 13 army groups havemoved into the capital area.   In Washington, the State Department urged all Americans to leaveChina at once, calling the situation ``volatile, uncertain andincreasingly dangerous.'' It ordered the evacuation of 258diplomatic dependents.   The United States chartered commercial planes to supplementregular U.S. airline departures from China, and officials organizedtransportation to help U.S. citizens get to airports, departmentspokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.   At Tiananmen Thursday morning, about 10,000 troops stood information, did drills or jogged around the 100-acre square.   About 40 tanks were lined up on the north end with guns pointingin all directions. An additional 20 tanks and armored personnelcarriers were at the south end of the square. There were no signs ofanti-aircraft weapons.   The situation in the provinces was deteriorating. Increasinglyviolent demonstrations protested the weekend military invasion ofBeijing.   State television broadcast a statement from the Communist Partythat any members found to have ``plotted, organized and led therebellion'' would be expelled and punished severely.   The warning mentioned no names, but conservative party leaderswho ordered the crackdown were said to have singled out party chiefZhao Ziyang as the instigator and ordered his ouster.   Another government announcement said soldiers were authorized to``forcibly dispose of, on the spot'' anyone who resisted arrest.Several citizens were reported killed Wednesday.   In the provinces, crowds protesting the army's invasion of thecapital barricaded major roads and railways in anticipation ofmilitary assaults.   Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, declared in Paris thatChina was ``on the verge of civil war'' and the French Embassy staffwould be reduced ``to the indispensable minimum.''   The Foreign Ministry said the U.S. decision to stop arms salesand military contacts in protest of the bloody crackdown was a``detriment to bilateral relations.''   Many other nations also imposed sanctions or froze relations.   China condemned the United States for giving refuge to dissidentFang Lizhi, who fled to the U.S. Embassy. It accused Fang ofattacking the communist system and said Washington was interferingin China's internal affairs.   Chinese informants reported seeing the bodies of three peoplekilled by soldiers and said seven people were killed or wounded nearthe railway station when a convoy of thousands of troops sped towardthe eastern suburbs Wednesday morning.   While no major fighting has materialized between the 27th Armyand supposedly rival military units on the edges of the city, awitness said the 27th and 38th armies, based in Hebei and Beijingrespectively, fought each other with automatic weapons earlyWednesday about 12 miles east of downtown.   The witness believed two bystanders were killed but was not sureabout military casualties.   Ms. Tutwiler said there were some clashes between small armyunits.   State television showed Chinese reporters Wednesday on a tour ofgarbage-strewn Tiananmen Square. Soldiers appeared to be sparselydeployed and tanks could be seen on the side near the imperialpalace.   ``Not one person died on the square,'' a martial law officialsaid. Witnesses and students driven from the square after athree-week protest said hundreds were shot down or crushed by tanksduring the invasion early Sunday.   China's top leaders have not appeared since the crackdown beganand official media report little about the violence.   In Washington, a Bush administration official, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said U.S. officials believe 84-year-old DengXioaping, China's senior leader who has been reported in ill health``is still alive ... and still running the show.''   In other cities:   _Six people were run over by a train while manning a barricadenear the Shanghai railway station Tuesday night. Shanghai radio saidangry crowds set the train ablaze and beat 21 railway securityofficials who tried to put the fire out.   _Tens of thousands of people in Xian blocked roads and heldanti-government demonstrations. Xian radio said the unrest ``wreckedthe city's life.''   _In Sichuan's capital, Chengdu, provincial radio said 100 peoplewere arrested after a ``gang of scoundrels'' stormed city officesand beat up 300 security officials on Sunday. The radio did notcomment on unconfirmed reports that 20 people died killed in clasheswith security forces.   _The Heilongjiang Daily in Harbin, northeastern China, saidroadblocks severely affected public transport and the situation was``extremely serious.''   _Also in the northeast, the mayor of Changchun said peopleblocked factory gates and ``if this situation continues, the city'seconomy will be paralyzed.''   Embassies arranging flights for nationals included those ofAustria, Britain, Canada, Japan, the Philippines, Switzerland andWest Germany.   U.S. Embassy press spokesman Andy Koss said 125 embassydependents would leave on a special commercial flight Thursday and73 dependents from four U.S. consulates leave as soon as possible.In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater saidfewer than 1,000 Americans remained in China.   Evacuation efforts gained urgency after soldiers fired on adiplomatic compound, then surrounded it in what they said was asearch for a sniper who killed one soldier and wounded three.Security officials took a Chinese man away.   Public transportation remained suspended in Beijing and shoppersformed long lines to buy scarce, expensive vegetables and meat.National television said postal service and milk delivery wouldresume Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
