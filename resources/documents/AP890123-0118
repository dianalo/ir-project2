The Piedmont Airlines Flight 1480 from O'Hare to Charlotte, N.C.,was a Boeing 737-200, a type of aircraft which the Federal AviationAdministration decided in November needed additional engine supportsafter investigating a similar 1987 incident.   However, the FAA order was not effective immediately and theairline may have been within the allowed time lapse, said WilliamBruce, who is heading an investigation of the Friday incident forthe National Transportation Safety Board. The Piedmont jet landedsafely after the engine fell in a field at the airport; no one wasinjured.   ``The modification had not been performed on this airplane,''Bruce said at a press conference Saturday.   Bruce said the November order said the supports could be addedanytime within the next 4,000 landings. He said he did not believethe aircraft had made that many landings since the order was issued.   Friday's incident was the second one of its type in 13 months.   Last January, the FAA ordered airlines to inspect someengine-mount bolts on 737-200s for cracks after an engine fell off aUSAir flight shortly after takeoff from Philadelphia on Dec. 5,1987, said Mitch Barker, an FAA spokesman in Seattle.   The Boeing 737-200 has two engines, one mounted under each wing.The plane, which can carry about 125 passengers, is also designed tofly on one engine, said David Shipley, a spokesman for USAir Inc,which owns Piedmont.   The pilots in both incidents were able to land the planes withthe one remaining engine and no injuries were reported.</TEXT></DOC>
