Six different technologiese.g. cogeneration, geothermal etc., are investigated by defining typicalconfigurations. Project cash flows are projected over a twelve year horizon,and the investor's internal rate of return (IRR) is calculated. Changesin IRR are calculated as various proposed tax changes are assumed totake effect. Capital intensive projects, such as geothermal and smallhydro, are found to suffer most from proposed tax code changes. Conversely,the least capital intensive projects, co-generation, fare best.</TEXT></DOC>
