MangunoStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FREST LABORMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> SEOUL, South Korea  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The strikes sweeping South Korea have created alarm within the government and business community. But so far, they have followed a relatively moderate course.    The radical militancy of the 1980 worker-student protest movement that ended in a military coup is largely absent this time. Missing, too, is the sustained violence of the anti-government demonstrations that forced President Chun Doo Hwan to promise democratic reform in June.    To be sure, some workers are making strident demands, and there have been clashes between strikers and police. Political analysts and corporate executives say it is impossible to predict if the labor unrest will escalate into more violent confrontations that threaten the nation's economy and its political evolution to democracy.    But many analysts in South Korea see hope that workers will continue to show restraint, working out company-by-company agreements with management. They seem confident that the powerful and resilient Korean economy will suffer little long-term damage from the work stoppages. And while the strife is portrayed by the media as a gathering storm, it actually comes in disorganized waves, with some strikes ending (in some cases only temporarily) as new ones are beginning.    A Western securities analyst here, who has been watching the Korean stock market rebound from a short hiatus even as the unrest spreads, says the spate of strikes is a &quot;mid-course correction&quot; in labor-management relations.    &quot;There are a lot of justified grievances that have built up over the past seven years,&quot; he says. &quot;It's no surprise that the workers are blowing off steam now. But it will die down before serious damage is done.&quot;    The workers, in addition to demanding higher wages and bonuses, want the right to form their own labor unions. And in today's freer political atmosphere, they are finding it easier to overcome fears that striking might jeopardize their jobs.    At the Daewoo group, whose shipyard, auto plant and machine factory have been shut down by strikes in the past week, says it isn't overanxious about the economic impact on its operations. &quot;The effects won't be so great,&quot; a spokesman says. &quot;We expect to fully recover from it.&quot; He says Daewoo's management believes the labor disputes are &quot;something which we have to overcome in becoming a democratically and economically advanced country.&quot;    To be sure, South Korean policy makers are worried about the dangers that unrest poses to the nation's export-led economy. The strikes have spread rapidly, paralyzing shipyards, coal mines, transportation companies and key export industries, including electronics, footwear and textiles. A shortage of parts has closed four of Korea's five auto companies and forced Hyundai Motor Co. to suspend exports of its popular Pony Excel subcompact.    Many public officials and business leaders warn of dire consequences if the monthlong disturbances continue. &quot;The impact so far is in the tens of millions of dollars, which isn't so damaging yet to Korea's economy,&quot; says a senior official of the Economic Planning Board. &quot;But the potential impact is quite severe. If it continues, the effect could be to swamp the ship.&quot;    Pessimists with vivid memories of the 1980 coup and the martial law that followed also worry that an escalation of the conflict into greater violence and social instability could provoke a political backlash. &quot;So far this time, the problems are all related to intra-company issues,&quot; says one official. &quot;But our worry is that they will spread to other issues, especially under the influence of the students, causing a very difficult social situation.&quot;    Choi Jang Jip, professor of political science at Korea University, agrees that the current labor protests are more moderate in tone and less violent than those of 1980. But they are also more widespread, he says. In addition, the increasingly complex Korean economy has become more dependent on a large network of suppliers and more concentrated in a handful of large, export-oriented conglomerates such as Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo and Lucky Goldstar groups. Thus, strikes at only a few companies are capable of crippling entire product lines.    &quot;The speed, velocity and scope of the labor unrest is enormously significant, politically and for the economy,&quot; says Prof. Choi. &quot;This is the first time that strikes have really hindered the processes of production. In some big companies, the work stoppages are crippling. Both entrepreneurs and the government are alarmed.&quot;    The government yesterday repeated its pledge to maintain strict neutrality in the labor disputes. But it also renewed its warning that it won't tolerate violence that threatens economic or social stability. And, following a limited cabinet meeting Wednesday presided over by Prime Minister Kim Chung Yul, officials vowed to block any &quot;alien elements&quot; trying to penetrate or exploit the labor troubles. The reference was to student radicals and political opposition leaders who officials say are trying to organize and inflame workers.    The Daewoo group, officials seem little concerned about the worsening labor troubles, even though 4,000 of the 15,000 workers at Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery Ltd. are continuing a strike that began Saturday and that forced the closure of the yard on Tuesday. &quot;Even the workers know that the world shipbuilding industry is in deep recession, so I think they will find room to compromise with management,&quot; a spokesman says.    The spokesman plays down the significance of a walkout at Daewoo Motor Co. of 2,000 of its 6,000 blue-collar workers. The action began Monday but ended yesterday. Similarly, workers on strike since Aug. 4 at Daewoo Heavy Industries Ltd.'s machinery plant in Changwon, southeastern Korea, reached agreement on a liberal new wage-and-benefits package Tuesday and are scheduled to return to work today.    The moderate tenor of some labor protests is illustrated by events at the Suwon plant of the Hanil textile company. After a work stoppage earlier this month, management agreed to a 15% wage increase. Earlier this week, there was another protest, a sit-in demonstration on the lawn outside the factory buildings, and demands for another 15% raise.    But yesterday, amid rumors that labor and management were discussing an additional 8% or 9% increase, the workers, most of them women, were back on the job.    Sitting in a cafe near the large textile complex, several young women say they want higher wages but don't have really militant pro-strike feelings. They work 44 hours and earn the equivalent of about $37.50 a week. &quot;The atmosphere is much better during the past two days,&quot; now that management has shown some willingness to bargain over wages, says one Hanil worker. </TEXT></DOC>
