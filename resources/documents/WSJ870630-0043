Sahakian, chairman and president, said.    That would indicate net income of $590,000 to $767,000, or 10 cents to 13 cents a share, based on 5.9 million shares outstanding. For the year-earlier third quarter, the company earned $453,000, or 11 cents a share, on fewer shares outstanding. Sales were $26.9 million. Uni-Marts operates convenience stores and owns an oil and gasoline distributor as well as a dairy products distributor.    He said cool, wet weather conditions damped sales at convenience stores along the New Jersey shore. Furthermore, deteriorating gasoline profit margins and the decline in interest income also cut into net income.    Uni-Marts expansion strategy remains &quot;on target,&quot; Mr. Sahakian said in an interview. &quot;The company's goal is to have 1,000 new stores in five years,&quot; up from 230 now, Mr. Sahakian said.    With stores already in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Delaware, Mr. Sahakian said the company is looking to expand into West Virginia, Ohio and Maryland. </TEXT></DOC>
