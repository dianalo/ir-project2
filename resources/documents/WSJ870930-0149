The show, sponsored by Egghead Inc., a Bothell, Wash.-based software retailing chain, featured a keynote speech by Lotus Development Corp.'s chairman, Jim Manzi.    At the end of the speech, the retail chain's mascot, Mr. Egghead, a costumed caricature of Albert Einstein, appeared at the podium, hugged Mr. Manzi and handed the embarrassed-looking software executive a cluster of helium-filled balloons.    Welcome to the new age of software retailing. Selling personal-computer software may never be confused with the glitz of peddling designer threads at Bloomingdale's. But a new generation of software merchants is bent on bringing it closer to mainstream retail marketing.    Software retail-chain stores are coming on-line around the country, seeking to capitalize on booming personal-computer sales and growing cost concerns of corporate users. Unlike their more stodgy competitors, these chains use marketing flash, offer big price discounts and locate in suburban shopping centers and malls -- just like traditional retailers.    &quot;Software stores are the best thing to happen to the industry in years,&quot; says Software Publishing Corp.'s Fred Gibbons. &quot;They walked into a void.&quot;    The void might account for the fledgling chains' explosive growth. In the past year, Egghead has about tripled the number of shops it operates, to 77. A competitor, Dallas-based Babbage's Inc., now runs 41 stores, up from 16 a year ago.    Babbage's, which expects sales of $25 million this year, has opened most of its stores in shopping malls. Says James McCurry, its chairman, &quot;We put the product in an environment the customer is familiar with -- next to the shoe store they've been shopping at for years.&quot;    Some traditional retailers themselves see potential in software, which this year is expected to produce $2.8 billion in sales, including those made directly by manufacturers. Barnes andamp; Noble Inc.'s B. Dalton Bookseller now runs more than 100 Software Etc. stores, up from eight in 1985, with annual sales of more than $50 million. And K mart Corp.'s Waldenbooks Inc. is testing software-only shops.    Until recently, however, software shoppers didn't have much choice on where to buy. The few specialized software stores were owned mainly by independent operators who couldn't afford to spend much on marketing or offer substantial price breaks. Shoppers also could purchase software by mail and wait weeks for their orders, or go to computer dealers who typically featured skimpy selections and charged list prices.    Software still accounts for only about 5% of most computer-store sales, explains Richard Rabins, president of Burlington, Mass.-based Alpha Software Corp. &quot;We're about as important to the dealers as printer ribbons and paper,&quot; he laments.    Victor Alhadeff, Egghead's 41-year-old founder and president, says he became interested in the business in 1983 while searching for programs to run his son's computer. Mr. Alhadeff says the independent-owned software stores in the Seattle area didn't show any pizazz in selling products, and he concluded that a market existed for stores offering a wide selection of programs at cut-rate prices.    &quot;When we looked at the industry we saw 20th-century products with 17th-century marketing,&quot; he says.    Mr. Alhadeff's move into software came after he had sold off the remaining partnerships in his oil and gas exploration business, a tax-shelter venture that was badly hurt by the slump in oil prices. (Several lawsuits against Mr. Alhadeff and the business, ENI Exploration Co., remain unsettled, some of which allege that investors were misled or weren't given pertinent information about the investment. Mr. Alhadeff denies the allegations.)    Mr. Alhadeff's timing has proven better with his new venture. Sources inside and outside the firm say the closely held company is profitable and is producing sales at an annual rate of $200 million.    A major attraction is the stores' discounts, which can amount to as much as 50% off the list prices of some programs. For example, Lotus's popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet program, which lists for $495, sells at Egghead for $319. Microsoft Word, which lists for $450, sells for $229.    Mr. Alhadeff has also tried to make the purchase of software less intimidating by shunning technical jargon and creating the company mascot. Mr. Egghead, he suggests, &quot;breaks down the barriers and makes people relax.&quot; Puns are also favored: His software shows are dubbed &quot;Eggzibitions.&quot;    Egghead stores are typically located in shopping centers, often near a computer store. Like a bookstore, hundreds of software titles are separated by category, such as entertainment, and by the type of computer the programs will run on. Customers are allowed to try out the merchandise and can seek help from salesmen who must learn new programs every week.    More than half of Egghead's sales, however, are generated by salesmen who work out of the stores' backrooms and sell directly to business customers, offering volume discounts from the stores' prices.    Steven Crummey, a senior vice president with Lotus, says Egghead's distribution system is attractive to businesses because they can ship thousands of programs to far-flung locations overnight, provide an invoice to each location immediately and offer big discounts. Even industry giant Lotus doesn't match that, he adds.    &quot;General Motors doesn't need support on 1-2-3,&quot; referring to the training and other follow-up services Lotus offers, Mr. Crummey says. &quot;What they need is a good price, and they want (delivery) tomorrow.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
