Utilizing loop parallelism is clearly most crucial in achievinghigh system and program performance. This method achieves simultaneouslythe two most important objectives: load balancing and very low synchronizationoverhead. For certain types of loops the authors show analytically thatguided self-scheduling uses minimal overhead and achieved optimal schedules.The authors discuss experimental results that clearly show the advantageof guided self-scheduling over the most widely known dynamic methods.</TEXT></DOC>
