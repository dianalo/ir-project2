The Respondentsfailed to answer.Because of the failure to answer, this office issued an Order, dated June6, 1989, ruling Respondents in default and directing Agency Counsel tofile an evidentiary submission by July 6, 1989, pursuant to andSection; 388.8of the Regulations, which provides:Default (a) General<ITAG tagnum="21">If a timely answer is not filed, the department shall file with theAdministrative Law Judge a proposed Order together with the supportingevidence for the allegations in the charging letter. The AdministrativeLaw Judge may require further submissions and shall issue any Order hedeems justified by the evidence of record, any Order so issued shall havethe same force and effect as an Order issued folowing the disposition ofcontested charges.</ITAG>Agency counsel filed the Motion for Default Judgment on June 29, 1989.The Agency also submitted documentary evidence to support allegations madein the charging letter. A copy of the above mentioned Motion for DefaultJudgment was also sent to the Respondents on July 7, 1989, to which therehas been no response.<ITAG tagnum="84">Facts and Discussion</ITAG>The charging letter, alleged that, on or about January 25, 1987, Langefalsified material facts in connection with five separate transactions.It is specifically alleged that, by so doing, Lange committed five violationsof section 787.5 of the Regulations, each of which involves U.S.-origincommodities controlled under section 5 of the Act for national securityreasons.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Effective October 1, 1988, the Export Administration Regulationswere redesignated as 15 CFR parts 768-799 (53 FR 37751, September 28, 1988).The transfer merely changed the first number of each Part from ``3'' to``7''. Until such time as the Code of Federal Regulations is republished,the Regulations can be found at 15 CFR parts 368-399 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28">The Regulations governing the violations at issue are found in the1987 version of the Code of Federal Regulations. Those regulations arecodified at 15 CFR parts 368-399 (1987) and, to the degree to which theypertain to this matter, are substantially the same as the 1988 version.</ITAG>The facts giving rise to the five charges are as follows: On or about November25, 1986, an investigation was initiated under the Act, to ascertain thewhereabouts of two DEC VAX 11/750 computers and certain other controlledU.S.-origin commodities that the Respondent Lange purchased during theyears 1985 and 1986. Ex. 2. As a part of that investigation, Lange wasasked to provide sales invoices identifying the persons to whom he hadsold the two DEC VAX 11/750 computers and any other U.S.-origin commoditieshe has acquired during those years. Ex. 2. In response to an Agency investigators request, on or about January 25,1987, Lange provided five sales invoices, Ex. 3(a), representing that Lange'scompany, PPC, had sold certain U.S.-origin commodities to: 1. Multifunktion GmbH, Bad Honningen, West Germany (Multifunktion), underaccount number 113-85; the invoice is dated November 22, 1985 and the controlledcommodity listed therein is a VAX 11/750 computer. Exs. 3(b) and 4; 2. Prosystem Vertriebs GmbH, Kelsterbach, West Germany (Prosystem) underaccount number 202-86; the invoice is dated January 17, 1986 and the controlledcommodity listed therein is a VAX 11/750 computer Exs. 3(c) and 4; 3. Elba Electric GmbH, Altlupheim, West Germany (Elba), under account number107-86; the invoice is dated May 6, 1986 and the controlled commodity listedtherein is a CDC 9766 Disk Drive. Exs. 3(d) 5; 4. Peka GmbH, Hamburg, West Germany (Peka), under account number 118-86;the invoice is dated July 24, 1986 and the controlled commodity listedtherein is an FP 750 Floating Point for a VAX 11/750 computer. Exs. 3(e)and 5; and 5. Prowie GmbH, Augsburg, West Germany (Prowie), under account number 126-86;the invoice is dated December 3, 1986 and the controlled commodity listedtherein is an FP 750 Floating Point for a VAX 11/750. Exs. 3(f) and 5.It was demonstrated that Lange had not in fact sold the above listed commoditiesto Multifunktion, Prosystem, Elba, Peka or Prowie. Exs. 6 and 2. In fact,the representations made on each of the five invoices that Lange providedto the Department were false. Under section 787.5 of the Regulations, no person may falsify or concealany material fact from the Office of Export Enforcement in the course ofan investigation instituted under the authority of the Act. The above-described evidence, established that during an investigation,Respondent Lange was asked to provide sales invoices that would identifythe whereabouts of two DEC VAX 11/750 computers and certain other controlledU.S.-origin commodities. The names of the persons to whom Lange had sold the two DEC VAX 11/750computers and other U.S.-origin commodities he had acquired during tenyears 1985 and 1986 were material facts because the DEC VAX 11/750 FloatingPoint for a VAX 11/750 computer are commodities that were controlled forreasons of national security. It was material, for the Agency to know theparties to whom those commodities had been sold in order for it to ensurethat they had not fallen into the hands of those who were not entitledto receive such exports. The evidence of record establishes that Respondent, during the course ofan investigation provided five invoices, each of which contained falserepresentations of material fact. By so doing, Lange falsified materialfacts in connection with five separate transactions and thereby committedfive violations of Section 787.5 of the Regulations, each of which involvedU.S.-origin commodities controlled under section 5 of the Act for nationalsecurity reasons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>The evidence submitted by Agency Counsel supports the allegations madein the charging letter of April 20, 1989. The Respondent falsified materialfacts in connection with the five separate export transactions as alleged.The pattern of conduct demonstrated by the violations show an intent toviolate United States export laws and regulations. The further reexportof these restricted pieces of equipment is a factor in aggravation furtherindicating a deliberate illegal scheme. I find that, as requested, an Orderdenying export privileges for fifteen years from the date that a finalorder should be entered in this proceeding. Such action is warranted andis reasonably necessary to protect the public interest, and to achieveeffective enforcement of the Export Administration Act and the Regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Order </ITAG>I.
