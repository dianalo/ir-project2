(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Paying the High Cost of Playing Catch-UpandM;The Army Corps of Engineers has begun rebuilding all its critical systems andtrying to serve district offices better with the Information SystemsModernization Program (ISMP).andM;In January, the corps issued a 300-page information management strategic plancovering the next seven fiscal years.andM;Eight corps administrative processes already have been analyzed, and thecorps has begun modernizing many of the systems associated with them.andP;  Othersystems that track corps real estate, facilities and accounting are beingredesigned to work in an integrated environment.andM;But this effort will be costly, the plan said, because the corps has not keptpace with advances in database management systems.andP;  Field activities willhave to bear more of the cost and development burden in the future.andP;  The plannoted the corps has not made workers aware of the status, speed and directionof ISMP.andM;At the heart of ISMP is the Corps of Engineers Automation Project (CEAP),which will replace much of the hardware, software and communicationsequipment at corps offices.andP;  An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantitycontract worth up to $365 million for the first phase of the program,CEAP-1A, was awarded in October to Control Data Corp.andM;CEAP-1A will replace existing Harris Corp. minicomputers and Honeywell Inc.andO;DP88 mainframes with five sizes of compatible new processors.andP;  It is expectedto deliver up to 98 systems to about 70 corps sites.andM;Linda Dean, a computer programmer at the program executive office forStandard Army Management Information Systems, said corps funding andpriorities will determine the scope of CEAP.andP;  Some corps officials said theyexpect the program to be scaled back significantly because of fundingproblems.andP;  But Dean said the corps will deploy CEAP as needed.andM;&quot;What happens from here on is based on need,&quot; Dean said.andM;The strategic plan stressed that a firm commitment will be vital, predictingthat the organization &quot;will continue to travel down many incompatible paths&quot;if it does not make the transition now to compatible computing andcommunications architectures.andM;CEAP, which began in 1983, has been delayed repeatedly by complexbenchmarking and vendor negotiations.andM;One official said the corps had been planning a mainframe replacement sincethe mid-1970s, with the existing Harris computers originally leased asinterim equipment but eventually bought at great expense.andM;He said the Harris equipment still meets his district's requirements and hewould prefer not to switch over to new equipment.andM;Information management officials at corps headquarters would not discuss theprogram.andP;  A spokesman said they did not want to make CEAP a target forfunding cuts by publicizing it.andM;Dean said the corps began pilot tests of the CDC equipment last month, withtesting scheduled for completion in June.andP;  Future deployments will be basedon the pilot test reports, availability of funds and level of support, thestrategic plan said.andM;The CDC computers will link to non-CEAP equipment via Ethernet TCP/IPconnections.andP;  Field activities will be responsible for their own interfacesand gateways into the CEAP architecture.andP;  However, the plan called thisinteroperability, a challenge, because the field activities lack thestandards to communicate internally and with outside hosts.andM;The ISMP also will upgrade office automation equipment, expand micro supportand promote use of commercially available software.andM;The strategic plan calls for CEAP machines to tie into the Army SupercomputerNetwork (ASNET) for access to four Cray Research inc. supercomputers.andM;The Army last year designated the corps Waterways Experiment Station inVicksburg, Miss., as one of the three major hubs in ASNET, now in theinstallation phase.andM;A Cray Y-MP 8/6128 was installed at the experiment station late last year toserve the entire Army.andP;  The supercomputer has six central processors, 1gigabyte of central memory and 128 million 64-bit words of high-speed diskstorage.andM;Software includes language compilers for FORTRAN, C, Pascal, Lisp/Prolog, Adaand Simscript; relational DBMS; statistical programming packages; afull-featured graphics system; and a Posix-compliant, UNIX-based operatingsystem.andM;The Army will use the supercomputer for engineering and scientificapplications including structural analysis and design, computational fluiddynamics, vehicle design, measurement of conventional and nuclear blasteffects on structures, image processing and warfare logistics simulation.andM;ASNET will have high-speed access to most major Defense and academiccomputing facilities in the United States.andM;As part of the network, the experiment station recently installed a56-kilobit/sec satellite connection to the Army Tank Automotive Command(TACOM) supercomputer.andM;This fiscal year, officials will expand ASNET to other field operatingactivities by running a T1 line between the Waterways Experiment Station andTACO, the plan said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
