According to U.S. and Saudi officials, the oil kingdomtold an American delegation led by Secretary of State JamesBaker that it will devote much of the enormous oil-pricewindfall it has received since Iraq invaded Kuwait tooffsetting the costs of the Persian Gulf crisis to the U.S.and other nations.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There was a meeting of the minds,&quot; a Saudi official said.&quot;The {U.S.} administration will not be disappointed in whatSaudi Arabia is willing to do.&quot; A U.S. official described theSaudi offer as &quot;a very, very substantial commitment.&quot;   Neither country's officials would put a figure on theagreement, but U.S. officials have generally confirmedreports that the Bush administration had been hoping theSaudis would supply about $4 billion over the next year topoor countries hurt by the embargo and about $500 millionmonthly toward meeting the added U.S. defense costs resultingfrom the Gulf crisis. The Pentagon expects the Gulf operationto cost it an extra $6 billion through 1990.   The U.S. officials also said several smaller Gulf stateshave agreed to contribute funds as well. Administrationofficials said they are hoping Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and theUnited Arab Emirates together will cover most of thePentagon's extra costs for the Gulf operation through 1990.   Mr. Baker will visit with leaders of Kuwait and the UAEtoday as part of a 10-day trip to countries in the PersianGulf region and northern Europe. Besides seeking financialcommitments to pay for the anti-Iraq effort, he is working tobuild further diplomatic momentum for the drive. TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady is leading a similar mission to aseparate list of countries.   As part of its drive, the U.S. is asking EuropeanCommunity nations to contribute as much as $2.5 billion. ECforeign ministers, meeting in Rome tomorrow, are expectedtentatively to approve aid to poorer nations in the region,but it's less certain they will contribute cash to defray thecosts of the U.S. military deployment.   The Saudi contributions to the anti-Iraq effort will gointo two separate funds. One will provide aid to poor Moslemcountries -- especially Egypt, Turkey and Jordan -- which aresuffering from the world-wide embargo of Iraq. The secondwill be used to provide monthly payments to the U.S., in cashor in kind, to help underwrite the U.S. troop deploymenthere.   American officials said King Fahd made explicit an earlierpromise to cover all of the costs incurred by the U.S. forstationing the massive force on Saudi territory. Among theitems to be covered would be fuel, transport and water. Inaddition, the Saudis may cover other costs, and may maketransfers to the U.S. Treasury, according to U.S. officials.They aren't expected to cover the initial costs of organizingthe deployment, though.   The Saudis could use a variety of mechanisms other thandirect payments to reimburse the U.S. For example, U.S.officials said the Saudis might pay other U.S. financialcommitments to offset the military spending. But theofficials wouldn't elaborate and insisted such details remainto be decided.   Administration economic officials traveling with Mr. Bakercarried detailed estimates of Saudi oil revenue, which oneofficial characterized as &quot;a very big number.&quot; Assumingaverage prices have risen about $10 a barrel since Iraqinvaded Kuwait, Saudi Arabia would be taking in $50 millionor more in added daily revenue on its pre-existingproduction, not counting the extra two million barrels a dayit has promised to pump. That tops the cost of the U.S.military operation here.   U.S. officials said the financial agreement took up only asmall portion of Mr. Baker's meeting with King Fahd and twocompanion sessions with the Saudi foreign minister, PrinceSaud al-Faisal Al Saud.   The Americans said that Saudi leaders are interested inexploring the nascent U.S. idea for a regional securitysystem in the Persian Gulf. And they said the Saudis reporteda decided swing in Arab public opinion against Iraq. Theofficials said that no new anti-Iraq measures were plannedduring the meeting, and that Saudi Arabia sought no newcommitments from the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
