(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. James Blanchard signed into lawMonday a ban on pregnancy for pay, making Michigan the first stateto establish surrogate parenting as a crime.   Brokers who arrange surrogate-parent contracts in Michigan willbe subject to felony penalties of up to five years in jail and a$50,000 fine under the statute, effective Sept. 1. Those whocontract for a birth or agree to bear a child for money will riskmisdemeanor penalties of up to 90 days in jail and a $10,000 fine.   Blanchard said he was signing the bill ``with reservations'' butadded: ``It is a significant improvement over the uncertainty andconfusion of existing state law. By taking the profit out ofchildbirth, it stands firm against the buying and selling of humanlife.   ``Taking no action to regulate surrogacy contracts would be moreharmful than taking incomplete or imperfect action.''   State Sen. Connie Binsfeld, a former Michigan Mother of theYear, pushed the bill through the Legislature. She has said hergoal was to drive out of Michigan one of the nation's most prolificsurrogate matchmakers: Dearborn attorney Noel Keane. Keane takescredit for arranging 228 surrogate births, including New Jersey's``Baby M.''   Under the new law, women who want to bear a child then give upthe baby to another couple still could do so and brokers couldstill arrange surrogate births, but they all would have to do itfor free.   Typically, infertile couples pay a broker $10,000 to match themwith a would-be mother. They pay another $10,000 to the woman whoagrees to be artifically inseminated, carry the child, then give upcustody. They also pay for the inseminations, medical procedures,prenatal care, hospital bills and other pregnancy-related expenses.   The new Michigan law declares those contracts unenforceable. Ifpeople still wish to enter such a pact, the mother can bereimbursed for her medical expenses and other pregnancy-relatedexpenses but nothing else.   Despite the new law, some people question whether it might belegal for a Michigan couple to sign a contract in another state andcarry out everything else in Michigan.   Michigan is the first state to attach criminal penalties tosurrogate-parent contracts, but not the first to tackle the issue.   Kentucky and Louisiana have enacted laws declaring suchcontracts illegal, but don't impose criminal penalties. Nebraskadoesn't recognize the legal validity of surrogate-parentingcontracts. Indiana has put enforcement of such arrangements on holdwhile the issue is researched, and proposed regulations were vetoedin Arkansas. In the landmark ``Baby M'' case, the New JerseySupreme Court outlawed surrogate-parenting contracts in that state.</TEXT></DOC>
