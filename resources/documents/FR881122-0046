I hereby affirm that approval andthe recommended Decision and Order of the ALJ. The ALJ is correct in hisconstruction of the agreement as applying in its operative Language onlyto Respondent Harrison in his individual capacity. Although Harrison admitscertain facts relating to Repondent Microelectronics Research Institute,his agreement with respect to denial of export privilege is limited tohimself. Thus, the matter remains open with respect to MicroelectronicsResearch Institute. If appropriate, a default order may be issued againstthe Institute in due time.This constitutes final Agency action as to Athol Mayo Harrison (DocketNumber 8102-01) in this matter.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 16, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Paul Freedenberg,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Under Secretary for Export Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Appearance for Dr. Harrison: Dr. Athol Mayo Harrison (pro se), AlSunset Hill, Horak Avenue, Camps Bay 8001, South Africa, and P.O.

App. 2401-2420)(1982 and Supp. III 1985)) (``Act'') and under the authority of the ExportAdministration Regulations (codified at 15 CFR Parts 368-399 (1988)) (``Regulations'').\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Regulations, formerly codified at 15 CFR Parts 368-399,are redesignated as 15 CFR Parts 768-799, effective October 1, 1988 (53FR 37751, September 28, 1988).The Charging Letter alleged that, during the period August 1982 throughMarch 1983, Respondent Harrison, as co-owner and managing director of RespondentMRI, ordered a U.S.-origin computer and related peripherals from a U.S.company, and paid for this equipment after its delivery to MRI. RespondentHarrison made this purchase, the Charging Letter stated, at the directionof another co-owner of MRI, who was a party denied all U.S. export privileges.Such action by Respondent Harrison was taken, according to the ChargingLetter, without the notification to and approval of the U.S. Departmentof Commerce that was required by andSection; 387.12 of the Regulations forhis participation in a transaction subject to the Regulations that benefiteda person denied U.S. export privileges. The Charging Letter claimed thatRespondent Harrison thus violated andSection; 387.12 of the Regulations.The Charging Letter added that this computer equipment was controlled underthe Act for national security reasons.Prior to issuance of the Charging Letter, the U.S. export privileges ofRespondent Harrison and Respondent MRI had been temporarily denied by anOrder issued November 23, 1983 (48 FR 54259 (1983) (``Temporary DenialOrder''). The Temporary Denial Order was modified three times: December21, 1983 (48 FR 57347 (1983)); January 31, 1984 (49 FR 4810 (1984)); andOctober 30, 1984 (49 FR 44229 (1984)). None of these modifications affectedthe denial of U.S. export privileges to which Respondents have been subjected.To settle the proceeding initiated by the Charging Letter, Respondent Harrisonand the Agency have entered into a Consent Agreement under andSection; 388.17of the Regulations. In the Consent Agreement, Respondent Harrison ``admitsthat the facts as stated in the Charging Letter are true'' (Consent Agreement2). Further in the Consent Agreement, the Agency and Respondent Harrisonagree on the imposition against him of a denial of U.S. export privilegesfor 20 years starting from November 23, 1983, the date that the TemoraryDenial Order began denying him such privileges (Consent Agreement 3-4).The undersigned approves the terms of the Consent Agreement. These termsare implemented by the Order set forth below. Dating Respondent Harrison's20-year denial period from the November 1983 point at which he became subjectto the Temporary Denial Order gives him the benefit of the five years thathis U.S. export privileges have already been denied. The results it thatthe Order set forth below assesses Respondent Harrison with a 15-year denialperiod prospectively, which is an appropriate sanction for the violationto which he has admitted.Agency Counsel submitted a proposed order that, in addition to implementingthe terms of the Consent Agreement, also would vacate the Temporary DenialOrder, as modified (paragraph E of such proposed order). This proposalis declined. The Temporary Denial Order, as modified, was issued againstRespondent MRI as well as against Respondent Harrison; and the record lackssufficient grounds to vacate the Temporary Denial Order as to RespondentMRI.Respondent Harrison claimed, in his May 16, 1988 Answer to the ChargingLetter (paragraph 5), the Respondent MRI ceased to exist in 1984. The ConsentAgreement recited (at 2) that Respondent Harrison so claims; and, in signingthe Consent Agreement, Respondent Harrison crossed out the phrase typedin after his name that read ``individually and doing business as MicroelectronicsResearch Institute.'' No evidence was submitted, however, to support RespondentHarrison's claim that Respondent MRI no longer exists. Nor did the Agencymake any statement about this claim, either confirming or contesting it.According to the Consent Agreement (at 2), in 1982-83 Respondent MRI wasco-owned by a party who had been denied all U.S. export privileges, andwas used by such party and by Respondent Harrison as a vehicle to violatethe Regulations. In the face of that record, before the temporary denialof U.S. export privileges to Respondent MRI is vacated, more is requiredthan Respondent Harrison's claim, without support by evidence or the Agency.Consequently, pursuant to the authority delegated to the undersigned byPart 388 of the Regulations, it is ordered as follows.<ITAG tagnum="84">Order</ITAG>I.
