The union had asked for help in case the strike proves to be along one, said Tom Baker, president of the InternationalAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local 751.   The unions that voted support represent 125,000 workers inWashington state.   No contract talks were scheduled as of Monday. There have beenno talks since 57,800 Machinists walked out Oct. 4 after rejectinga three-year Boeing Co. contract offer.   The strike affects Boeing plants in the Seattle area, atWichita, Kan., Portland, Ore., and several other sites.   ``This was a real upbeat meeting,'' Baker said after Monday'sone-hour session with other labor leaders. ``People are willing todo whatever they can do monetarily. They're going to form ahardship fund, that type of thing.''   Other unions expressed solid support, said Larry Kenney,president of the Washington State Labor Council.   Boeing officials, meanwhile, said they didn't know how tointerpret the meeting and union support.   ``I still don't think anybody at this point knows how long astrike it will be,'' said Paul Binder, Boeing spokesman.   Another Boeing official, Harold Carr, said the company waswaiting for more specific demands from the union before resumingnegotiations.   Baker angrily dismissed Carr's statement.   ``...The Boeing people who were involved in the negotiationsknow what our position is. They're just playing games,'' he said.   Federal mediator Doug Hammond left a recording on his answeringmachine saying no talks were scheduled.   In an Everett hotel north of here, recruiters from IntertecAviation Co. of Phoenix, Ariz., said they were deluged by hundredsof people answering their newspaper ad for aircraft maintenanceworkers. The visit was planned before the strike.   ``When I got to town Sunday night, there were already 15 peoplewaiting at the hotel,'' recruiter Jack Tubert said Monday. ``Wehired 10 of the 15 people.''   Tubert said many Boeing machinists were among those interested.He said some of the people Intermec has hired on this trip werestrikers but he did not have exact figures.   The two-year-old company is looking for licensed supervisors andmechanics and must hire 100 people before Jan. 1, he said.   In Wichita, where Boeing Military Airplanes is headquartered,hundreds of strikers rallied early Monday before joining picketsfor a peaceful show of force at plant gates. There was a similarrally in Everett, where the 747s and 767s are built.   Boeing has delivered two planes since the strike began: a 747 toMalaysia Airlines and a 757 to Ansett Worldwide, an Australianleasing company which will pass the plane on to Air Belgium.   Before the strike, Boeing committed to delivering 57 jetlinersbefore the end of the year. Five consecutive years of record ordershave given the company a backlog that stretches into the late 1990s.   That backlog and the steady stream of overtime that workers havebeen asked to work were behind Machinists' demand for better wagesand less overtime.   Boeing's offer featured an immediate wage hike of 4 percent with3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, annual bonuses of 8 percentof a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent in 1990.   Mandatory overtime would have been reduced from 200 hours perquarter to 160 hours and the cost-of-living formula improved toaccount for virtually all inflation.   Boeing said a Machinist in a middle skill grade, such as anengine mechanic, could see pay go from $34,389 this year to $43,138in 1992, counting seniority and cost-of-living increases, butexcluding $13,000 in bonuses and any overtime.   Workers, who have seen bonuses but no increases in their basewage for six years, say that's not enough.   Boeing earned $356 million on sales of $9.07 billion for thefirst half of 1989, and had profits of $614 million on sales of$16.96 billion in 1988.   The strike is the Machinists' first against Boeing since 1977when there was a 45-day walkout.   Industry analysts say what happens at Boeing will affect labortalks at other aerospace plants. Talks have been extended in aMachinists contract that expired Sunday with Lockheed Corp. inMarietta, Ga.   The union's contract with McDonnell Douglas, Boeing's only U.S.competitor for jetliners, expires Oct. 22.</TEXT></DOC>
