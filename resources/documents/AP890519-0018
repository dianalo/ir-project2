(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At last, Buffalo is getting its day in thesun.   A new report compiled from three decades of weather data isliterally putting this much maligned city in a new light.   Buffalo recorded the highest percentage of sunshine _ 67 percent_ of any major Northeast city from June through August. Buffaloalso had the least rain during the period _ 8.69 inches _ and wasthe coolest with an average July afternoon temperature of 80degrees,   ``People just can't believe it,'' Robert Carr, a spokesman forthe Greater Buffalo Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. ``They'vegot this misconception that all we have is snow.   ``Sure, we get our snow, but we get our sun, too,'' Carr added.   Residents have long complained that on the basis of one storm _the Blizzard of 1977 _ the city has the reputation of a frozentundra.   Buffalo did have the most snow of any large city during the1970s, according to the weather service. But other, smaller NewYork cities such as Syracuse and Watertown, and Caribou, Maine,received more snow.   The last three winters in Buffalo have been unusually mild, withless than 67 inches of snow. The average yearly total is 96.6inches.   Carr and other Buffalo residents are hoping that the new report,which was compiled by meteorologist Stephen McLaughlin usingweather service data, will help change the city's image.   ``You can't argue with the statistics,'' Carr said.   Buffalo's 67 percent sunshine _ the equivalent of two sunny daysout of every three _ edges out Boston at 65 percent; New York City,64 percent; Baltimore and Washington, each 63 percent;Philadelphia, 62 percent; Albany, 61 percent; and Pittsburgh, 58percent.   Lake Erie, the source of much of Buffalo's snow in winter, isresponsible for its pleasant conditions in summer, according tometeorologist Jerry Pace of the National Weather Service in Buffalo.   While cold air moving across warm lake waters generateslake-effect snows in fall and early winter, warm winds across coldwaters dampen the formation of clouds in spring and early summer,Pace said.   In addition, cool breezes off the lake keep summer temperaturesdown, so that there are few uncomfortably hot days in Buffalo, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
