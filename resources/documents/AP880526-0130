Following an unsually intense period of diplomatic exchanges,U.S. officials say they see the southern Africa issue as the ThirdWorld conflict that offers the best hope for a settlement.   It is not clear how much personal attention President Reagan andSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will pay to the issue but otherofficials said that, at a mimimum, it will be discussed at lowerlevels.   Under Secretary of State Michael Armacost said last week thatthe United States has been seeking from the Soviets use of theirinfluence with Angola and Cuba ``to encourage a realistic andprompt timetable'' for the withdrawal of Cuban forces.   According to U.S. estimates, Cuba has increased by at least6,000 its troop strength in Angola to between 43,000 and 45,000over the past several months. It also has deployed its forces towithin a few miles of the border with South African-controlledSouth-West Africa, also known as Namibia, for the first time.   Aside from the Cuban troop issue, the administration also hasbeen asking the Soviets to promote a process of nationalreconciliation between the Marxist government in Angola and theU.S.-backed rebel group, UNITA. The two sides have been at war foralmost 13 years.   South Africa sent up to 3,000 troops into Angola last year insupport of UNITA although Angolan estimates of Pretoria'sinvolvement have been much higher.   With Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker playing thekey role, the administration has for years been attempting topromote the withdrawal of all foreign forces from southern Africa _Cubans from Angola and South Africans from Namibia and Angola.   As the U.S. sees it, this would free the area of both superpowercompetition and colonialism, enabling the region to concentrate ondevelopment after years of warfare. Namibia is Africa's last colony.   The administration has been calling for parallel movement onboth the Angolan and Namibian issues. The stumbling block thus faris that while the South Africans have agreed to turn Namibia overto an independent government under a one-year timetable outlined ina U.N. Security Council resolution, Angola has proposed a Cubandeparture from Angola over a four-year time frame.   The United States believes the Angolan timetable is excessive.With U.S. support, South Africa has said it will not relinquishcontrol over Namibia unless there is an early timetable for a fullCuban withdrawal from Angola.   As described by U.S. officials, the principal Soviet advantagein encouraging a peaceful settlement is that the Kremlin would bespared continued large-scale losses of military equipment.   The South African military has said that during a 1987 Angolanoffensive against UNITA and South African forces, Soviet-madeequipment losses included eight MiG 23s, four MiG 21s, eighthelicopters and 94 tanks, among other items.   But the Cuban military has said that in recent fighting, a SouthAfrican escalation was given a ``firm, decisive and crushingresponse.'' Cuba has defended its presence in Angola as an effortto protect that country against ``racist aggression'' by SouthAfrica.   Lately, the pace of diplomacy has increased. Earlier this month,officials from the United States, South Africa, Angola and Cuba metin London to explore the possibilities for a settlement. Theparties expressed satisfaction with the outcome of theunprecedented encounter and agreed to meet again.</TEXT></DOC>
