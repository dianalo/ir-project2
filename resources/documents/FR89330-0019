This route would be established from Amarillo,via San Angelo, TX, to Junction, TX, to add flexibility for maneuveringen route, departure and arrival traffic in these terminal areas. Theseareas also have extensive military activities. This action would reducecontroller coordination and workload. Section 75.100 of Part 75 of theFederal Aviation Regulations was published in Handbook 7400.6E dated January3, 1989.The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthat will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it iscertified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 75</ITAG>Aviation safety, Jet routes.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the Federal AviationAdministration proposes to amend Part 75 of the Federal Aviation Regulations(14 CFR Part 75) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 75_ESTABLISHMENT OF JET ROUTES AND AREA HIGH ROUTES</ITAG>1.
