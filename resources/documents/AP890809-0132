(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   City money won't go to groups otherthan health clinics serving illegal aliens in an effort todiscourage the immigrants from coming to Costa Mesa, the CityCouncil decided.   The council agreed Tuesday to withhold funds from such groups asBoys and Girls Club, the South Orange County YMCA, The FeedbackFoundation and Opera Pacific.   Councilman Orville Amburgey said the city has become a mecca forillegal aliens taking advantage of the assistance programs.   ``We did some checking and found out the `coyotes' who guideillegal immigrants into the United States are telling them that ifthey come to Costa Mesa they can get employment, food, shelter andclothing,'' Amburgey said.   The 3-2 vote for the measure drew immediate criticism.   ``It is ill-advised, ill-conceived and very imprudent,'' saidRev. Jaime Soto of the Orange County Coalition for ImmigrantRights. ``It is really undue government interference into theaffairs of voluntary agencies. It seems a very uncivic spirit thatmotivates the policy.''   The city gave more than $266,000 in Community Development BlockGrant funds and general revenue sharing funds to 30 organizationslast year, the city manager's office said.   Council member Mary Hornbuckle, who voted against the decision,said many non-profit agencies' budgets leave little room forexpenditures to screen clients.   ``This will certainly create another headache,'' said attorneyRebecca Jurado of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``It seems tobe another tactic to get rid of illegal immigrants, and is clearlygoing to be discriminatory.''</TEXT></DOC>
