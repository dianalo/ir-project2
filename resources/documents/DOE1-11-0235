Westinghouse is using thistechnology to develop innovative design features that will preclude hypotheticalcore-disruptive accidents. Key to the development of an inherently safeLMR is the optimization of the various thermal-hydraulic and nucleardesign parameters. This article describes this process with particularfocus on several of the more significant parameters and then describesa series of tests that could be performed in a fast flux test facilityto demonstrate proof of principle and provide a verification data baserelative to LMR inherent safety.</TEXT></DOC>
