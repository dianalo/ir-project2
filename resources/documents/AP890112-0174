Earlier this week, a federal judge in Texas issued a temporaryrestraining order lifting an immigration policy that restrictedimmigrants to the area near the Mexican border. Officials there saythat probably 5,000 exiles are affected, and a Miami shelterofficial, Cristobal Mendoza, said the city will probably have 2,000new arrivals by the weekend.   Managers of bus stations in South Texas told reporters that 95percent or more of the Nicaraguans who left there Wednesday weregoing to Miami. Permission was given to 739 exiles to leaveBrownsville on Wednesday.   As the buses pulled into Miami on Wednesday and Thursday, hopefulNicaraguans climbed off, eager to reunite with their families andfind jobs.   But city officials, who originally thought they would spend thisweek getting ready for the Super Bowl, say the aliens may not findthe haven they expect.   ``The inn is full,'' City Manager Cesar Odio said, referring toMiami Bobby Maduro Stadium, home now to more than 250 immigrants.And those already there must be out by Jan. 25 _ when the BaltimoreOrioles baseball team will arrive for spring training.   The judge's order in Texas was to relieve the conditions ofaliens stuck there for weeks, many living in squalid conditions.   Now they can stay wherever they like while they wait for theircases to be reviewed, and many have chosen Miami.   Dade County Manager Joaquin Avino said some county land is beingcleared for as many as 60 trailers, which will provide temporaryhousing.   New immigration rules are responsible for much of the confusionsurrounding this latest influx of immigrants, Perry Rivkind,district director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service saidThursday.   In the past, those who arrived illegally in the United Stateswere entitled to work permits if they could not be interviewed abouttheir applications for asylum within 60 days. But applicants nowmust get a favorable ruling from the INS before getting a permit.   ``What people don't understand that come here illegally today isthat the U.S. Congress passed employer sanctions,'' said Rivkind.``Without the work permit, the employers are not going to chancegetting into trouble.''   Many of the aliens said they headed to Miami because they hadheard the city was supportive of them.   ``Throughout Mexico, they kept on telling us about Bobby Madurostadium,'' said Sergio Castillo. He passed through Mexico crossingthe Rio Grande on Sunday and arrived in Miami by bus Wednesday. ``SoI came here. But I thought everybody could enter.''   Castillo and 14 others were locked out of the stadium Wednesdaynight. He said he spent much of that night walking the streets,looking for a place to stay.</TEXT></DOC>
