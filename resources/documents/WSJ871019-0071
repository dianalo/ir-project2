The Democrats believe their efforts will give them the high ground in the coming debate over how to reduce the deficit. They are gambling that their tax packages, carefully crafted to put the burden of higher taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations, will look better to most Americans than the automatic spending cuts that will be ordered under the Gramm-Rudman law in the absence of a deficit reduction plan.    Pushing ahead on the tax front, the Senate Finance Committee approved, on a 13-7 vote, an $11.6 billion tax package. Two Republicans, John Chafee of Rhode Island and John Heinz of Pennsylvania, joined 11 Democrats in voting for the bill.    Much as the $12.3 billion package approved earlier by the Ways and Means Committee, the Senate measure largely would hit high-income wage earners and corporations. Its major provisions would raise Social Security taxes for about eight million people who earn more than $45,000 next year, and eliminate a major tax break for defense contractors.    &quot;All you have to do is look at what's happening to interest rates and the financial markets to see that we have to do something about this deficit,&quot; said Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas). &quot;No one likes to vote for taxes, but it's time to face the tough choices.&quot;    Under the Democrats' plans, tax increases would account for about half of the $23 billion deficit reduction required by the Gramm-Rudman law. If Congress fails to adopt a plan to achieve the law's deficit target, automatic spending cuts will be imposed Nov. 20.    Besides arguing that their tax increases won't affect most Americans, the Democrats argue that their approach is more responsible than cutting spending across the board. &quot;We do not affect the taxes of average, middle and low-income Americans,&quot; said Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) in a Saturday radio speech touting the panel's package.    &quot;In the coming weeks, there will be a vigorous debate about the need for increased taxes,&quot; he continued. &quot;You'll hear from the critics of the Democratic plan. When you do, ask them about the effect that Gramm-Rudman cuts will have on your community -- your hospitals, schools and farms.&quot;    Congressional Republicans, who refused to join Democrats in devising the tax legislation, maintain that the federal budget should be narrowed just by reducing spending. Most are convinced that they won't suffer politically if the automatic Gramm-Rudman cuts, called sequestration in budget parlance, are imposed. They say the Democrats, however, stand to lose more with their tax packages by reinforcing their image as the &quot;tax-and-spend&quot; party.    &quot;I wouldn't mind if sequestration occurred,&quot; said Rep. John Duncan (R., Tenn.). Following a recent meeting with congressional Republicans, Treasury Secretary James Baker acknowledged that some GOP lawmakers and administration officials prefer automatic cuts to a tax increase. Yesterday, appearing on NBC-TV's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Mr. Baker said the automatic cuts look &quot;better and better,&quot; compared with tax measures. &quot;I think the chances are we'll get the automatic sequestration,&quot; he added.    The bill approved Friday by the Finance Committee would require workers to pay the 1.45% Medicare tax on all their wages. Currently, the tax applies just to annual wages up to $43,800. That ceiling is scheduled to rise to $45,000 in 1988 under current law. The Finance Committee provision would raise the tax for a worker earning $100,000 next year by $797.50 to $1,450 from $652.50 under current law.    Sen. Dave Durenberger (R., Minn.) criticized the provision, saying the payroll tax was designed to pay for Medicare and shouldn't be used to reduce the federal budget deficit. &quot;And this will fall on wages earned by two-income families, rather than somebody who makes $1 million on unearned income,&quot; he added.    But Sen. George Mitchell (D., Maine) countered that those who earn less than $45,000 already have all their wages subject to the health insurance tax. &quot;This only would affect the top 8% of American taxpayers,&quot; Sen. Mitchell said.    The tax bill passed by the Ways and Means Committee doesn't contain a similar provision.    The Finance Committee bill would extend the expiring 3% tax on telephone service for three years. It would toughen rules that require corporations to pay their taxes in advance. And it would eliminate the &quot;completed-contract&quot; accounting method. The method enables defense contractors and large construction firms to defer a big share of federal taxes on projects until they are completed. The House version contains these measures as well.    Unlike the House bill, the Senate measure includes a &quot;taxpayers' bill of rights&quot; aimed at halting what some lawmakers view as abuses by the Internal Revenue Service. It would allow the IRS ombudsman to issue orders for agents to halt any abusive action immediately. And taxpayers could sue agents for reckless acts.    The House version would limit deductibility of interest on home-equity loans and home mortgages. It also would take away several tax breaks currently possible in mergers and acquisitions, particularly hitting highly leveraged takeovers.    The full House is expected to take up the entire budget package, including the tax increase, on Oct. 28. The Senate is likely to take up the Finance committee bill shortly after that. </TEXT></DOC>
