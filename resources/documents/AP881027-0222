But ``Kristallnacht: The Journey from 1938 to 1988'' spotlights amoment in history when history could have been changed. The worldwas shocked, but did nothing, and Hitler's destruction of the Jewswent forward.   The one-hour film will air over the Public Broadcasting Serviceon Nov. 9, the 50th anniversary of ``crystal night,'' whenwidespread Nazi attacks on synagogues and Jewish businesses andhomes littered the streets with shattered glass.   ``It was Hitler's last test to see how the world would react, andthe world reacted with silence,'' said Ronald Lauder, who underwrotethe film through his Robert S. Lauder Foundation, a philanthropicorganization that aims to preserve European Jewish history andculture.   Lauder, heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune, served asambassador to Austria from 1985-87, and was an outspoken critic ofanti-Semitism at a time when Austrians were electing former U.N.Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim as their president in spite of hisNazi background.   Lauder told a small group that gathered for a preview screeningof the documentary that its purpose was ``to teach us a lesson thatwe have to speak out, speak out whenever there is any type ofbigotry government-sponsored, any type of religious persecution.''   The film describes the events through rare pictures, includingnever-before-seen amateur movies of the burning of a synagogue, andinterviews with survivors and witnesses. It later catches up withpresent-day Austrians and Germans who have varying opinions on theirconnection to the past.   Kristallnacht is well-known in Europe, but Lauder said he waschagrined to find out that only about 10 percent of Americans polledby his foundation had ever heard of it.   ``It became part of me when I was in Vienna,'' he said in aninterview. ``I began to realize all the different currents, why theywere happening. I also saw in Vienna there were very few synagoguesleft. One of the major ones ... is today a parking lot. I realizedthat this was a center of Jewish life, and there's a parking lot.What happened?   ``After Nov. 9, 1938, the world was never the same,'' Laudersaid. ``There was something different. People couldn't put theirfinger on it, but it was different. It affects your life, it affectsmy life, it affects all our lives. And that's why I did it. I wantedpeople to understand it. And no matter how much I explained topeople when I travel what happened, I couldn't get it across.''   For producer Robert Frye, a former ABC News producer, makingLauder's film was a difficult project, since little visual materialwas available.   ``The Nazis didn't want any evidence of the widespread nature ofthis,'' Frye said. He held little hope for film footage untilsomeone tipped him there was an amateur film sitting in a museum inGermany.   ``That began a three-four-month process,'' Frye said. ``No onewould tell us who owned the film. After leaving Austria on theactual shoot, we drove to Munich and on the way found out ... thatthe woman who owned the film lived near. So we knocked on the doorand completed the deal. It is, as far as I know, the only footagethat shows in motion picture terms what happened.''   The film sets the scene through interviews with witnesses wholived in Germany in 1935 as Hitler was rising to power and findinglittle resistance to his propaganda campaign against Jews.   A Polish family forced to leave Germany wrote a plaintive letterto a son in Paris. To protest the persecution of his family,17-year-old Herschel Grynzspan walked into the German Embassy andshot a minor German official, Ernst vom Rath. Retribution for vomRath's death became an excuse for Kristallnacht.   ``This was for good, we knew. The end of our normal life,''recalls witness Paul Grosz.   In present-day West Germany, Frye's cameras follow Israeliprofessor Meier Schwarz on his quest to find evidence of the Jewswho once lived in the Germany of his boyhood. In Ansbach, he watchesworkmen restoring a magnificent synagogue.   ``The main thing is to restore what happened here,'' Schwarzsays. ``To make a memory for our parents.'' But he acknowledgesthere is no one to worship in the synagogue. No Jews live in Ansbachanymore.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Nov. 6</NOTE></DOC>
