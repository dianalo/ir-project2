Redco believed that this amendment would reduce thenumber of injuries that occur during the servicing of tires and rims forthese vehicles. NHTSA concludes that the requested actions would not beeffective in significantly reducing injuries. Further, some of the requestedactions, which would regulate motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipmentalready in use, are outside the agency's statutory authority. Therefore,the Redco petition is denied.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Mr. George Soodoo, Office ofRulemaking, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 SeventhSt., SW., Washington DC 20590.

The purpose of this standardis to provide safe operational performance of these vehicles by ensuringthat the vehicles are equipped with tires of adequate size and load ratingand with rims of appropriate size and type designation. The standard specifiesrequirements for tire and rim selection, rim marking, and label informationfor multi-piece and single piece tire rims. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Multi-Piece and Single Piece Wheel Rims </ITAG>Generally speaking, a multi-piece rim consists of two or more componentswhich, when they are assembled and the tire is inflated, are held togetherby the force of the air pressure in the tire. A multi-piece rim includesa rim base, which is the largest part of the metal structure supportingthe tire, and one or more detachable side rings serving as a flange tokeep the inflated tire on the rim base. The rim base, side ring, lock rings,and tire are collectively referred to as a ``wheel''. The rim base andthe side or locking rings are the primary components which support thetire's bead. This structure is referred to as a split side ring in twopiece assemblies and a solid side ring and split lock ring in three pieceassemblies. A multi-piece rim is used in conjunction with tube type tires,most frequently on trucks, tractors, buses, trailers, campers and off-highwaytype vehicles. (See 29 CFR 1910.177(b); and Society of Automotive Engineers,SAE J393, which defines rim terminology). There are basically four types of multi-piece wheel designs. In the firstdesign (exemplified by Goodyear's KW type rim), the rim base is split radiallyand the side ring is circumferentially continuous. In the second design(exemplified by Firestone's, Kelsey-Hayes's, and Budd's RH5anddegrees; andKL rims), both the rim base and the side ring are circumferentially continuous.The third type of rim (exemplified by Goodyear's ``LW'' type rim) is atwo piece assembly composed of a demountable rim base and a split sidering. The fourth design in the larger sizes (exemplified by Firestone's``Commander 5'') is a three piece assembly composed of a rim base, a sideand a lock ring. Multi-piece rim failures occur during or after inflation of the tire whenthe side or lock ring is not properly engaged on the rim base. When thisoccurs, the lock ring can be hurled off the rim base at speeds in excessof 100 miles per hour. This poses a risk of serious harm to anyone in itspath. A single piece rim wheel is defined as ``the assemblage of single piecerim wheel with the tire and other components.'' 29 CFR 1910.177(b). Singlepiece rims are used in conjunction with tubeless tires on passenger carsand light trucks, and some medium and heavy duty trucks. With single piecerims, the tire bead must be forced over the top of the rim flange to mountthe tire. A single piece rim is designed with one side of the rim narrowerthan the other side to facilitate the installation of the tire on the wheel.NHTSA is aware of reported injuries and fatalities that have been associatedwith the explosive separation of wheel assemblies on large vehicles. Ina notice issued at 44 FR 12072, March 5, 1979, the agency reported thatit had records of 439 explosive separations between 1957 and 1979, of which71 such accidents resulted in deaths, and 234 accidents which resultedin serious injuries, including the loss of one or both eyes, head damageand face disfigurement. During this period, rim separations reportedlyoccurred on vehicles being driven or parked on the road in at least 96cases and during tire repair and maintenance operations in at least 197cases. The other cases were not positively identified as being on the roador in repair or maintenance situations because of insufficient information.Since the promulgation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) of its multi-piece rim wheel servicing regulation in 1980 (whichis discussed further below), NHTSA's Office of Defect Investigation (ODI)has compiled a list of 451 reported accidents involving explosive separationof wheels between 1980 and 1985. Approximately 70 percent or more of theseaccidents were shop accidents which involved repair, maintenance, or otherhandling of the wheels. The data were unclear as to where the other 30percent of the accidents occurred. Most of the rims in these accidentswere 12 to 18 years old, while the associated vehicle was on average 10to 15 years old. At least 154, or 34 percent, of the reported accidentsinvolved either the RH5anddegrees; or K-Type rims, which are no longer produced.Since 1985, only seven wheel explosions have been reported to NHTSA. Fiveof these reported explosions involved the RH5= or K-Type rim. Further,90 percent of all the reported accidents involve wheel assemblies overten years old. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. OSHA and NHTSA Regulatory Action Concerning Tire Rims</ITAG>OSHA and NHTSA have adopted and/or considered methods to make the servicingof tire rims safer. On January 29, 1980, OSHA promulgated a safety regulation(29 CFR 1910.177) related to the servicing of multi-piece rim wheels ontrucks and other large motor vehicles. (45 FR 6705). On February 3, 1984,that agency amended the regulation to include requirements for the safeservicing of single piece rim wheels. (49 FR 4338). Title 29 CFR 1910.177applies to the servicing of single piece and multi-piece rims on largemotor vehicles such as trucks, tractors, trailers, buses, and off-roadmachines. The OSHA regulation requires an employer to (1) specify proceduresrelated to the training of employees who service rim wheels, (2) providea rim wheel restraining device or other barrier to be used during the inflationof tires, (3) ensure that wheel components are not interchanged exceptas provided in a NHTSA approved chart or safety manual, and (4) make certainthat the employees follow safe operating procedures for the servicing ofthe wheel assemblies.Title 29 CFR 1910.177 does not apply to the servicing of rim wheels usedon automobiles, pickup trucks and vans that utilize automobile tires ortires designated ``LT.'' Further, the OSHA regulation does not apply tobusinesses that have no employees other than the owners or to the construction,agricultural, and maritime industries. However, OSHA does regulate theseemployers and places of employment under the Construction Safety Standards,29 CFR Part 1926; the Agriculture Standards, 29 CFR Part 1928; and theMaritime Standards, 29 CFR Parts 1915 through 1918.NHTSA also considered whether Standard No. 120 should be amended to requiremulti-piece rims to meet certain performance requirements to reduce thenumber of explosive separations of these types of rims, in an advance noticeof proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) at 44 FR 12072, March 5, 1979. NHTSA terminatedthis rulemaking action on February 25, 1982, 47 FR 8232. For several reasons,the agency determined that the number of explosive separations would bereduced without conducting rulemaking. Among those reasons were, first,that OSHA's regulation already specified certain safety precautions inthe servicing of wheel assemblies. Second, most explosive separations haveinvolved the Goodyear K-Type of rim or the Firestone RH5anddegrees;; theK-Type has not been produced since 1968 and the RH5anddegrees; has not beenproduced since 1973. Thus, as these two types of rims approach the endof their useful lives, they will be replaced with newer designs which shouldbe less prone to explosive separation. (47 FR 8232-8233).NHTSA notes that, in cooperation with the agency, rim manufacturers areincreasing their voluntary efforts to distribute rim servicing safety information.On September 23, 1987, January 27, 1988, and March 30, 1989, NHTSA's Officeof Defects Investigation held meetings with rim manufacturers to encouragethe manufacturers to voluntarily increase their efforts in this area. NHTSAhas developed and is finalizing an informational brochure which includesthe input from various rim manufacturers and OSHA. As a result, NHTSA andthe manufacturers will be distributing this pamphlet concerning safetyprecautions related to rim servicing. This information will be distributedto individuals who service truck rims and wheels, especially those notcovered by the OSHA regulation at 29 CFR 1910.177. The agency and the rimmanufacturers also are considering the design and distribution of additionalrim servicing and safety information in other forms.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Redco Petition </ITAG>On October 30, 1987, Redco Corp., a manufacturer of multi-piece and singlepiece rims and wheels, submitted a petition for rulemaking requesting anamendment to Standard No. 120.\1\<NOTE/> The petitioner sought to supplement the OSHA safety regulationsby asking NHTSA to mandate that additional literature concerning the servicingof tires and rims be placed in and on the vehicles that are subject toStandard No. 120 (except for motorcycles). The petitioner asserted thata segment of the tire and wheel servicing industry is left unregulatedbecause the OSHA safety regulation does not apply to either businessesthat do not have employees other than the owners or to the construction,agriculture and maritime industries. It contended that this segment ofthe industry does not always voluntarily seek out or request this safetyinformation, even though it is available upon request from OSHA or therim manufacturers. Although Redco conceded that on the job training isthe most effective way to insure safety when servicing tires and wheels,it contended that the distribution of admonitory and instructional literaturewould further the interests of motor vehicle safety related to the servicingof tires and rims.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Petition not published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The petitioner asked NHTSA to take the following four actions to reducethe number of injuries related to the servicing of tire and wheel assemblies.First, Redco asked the agency to mandate that any truck, bus, or multipurposepassenger vehicle that has a cab be required to maintain a fold-up OSHAchart in its door pocket or glove compartment. Second, the petitioner askedthe agency to require that a warning label be placed in the cab and nearthe trailer wheels. This label was to warn that a person should not servicethe wheel assembly unless he or she has read the OSHA charts and obtainedtraining. Third, Redco asked NHTSA to join with OSHA to distribute warningcards to the Department of Transportation for each state. The two Federalagencies then would request that the state DOTs distribute these cardsat weigh-in stations, during vehicle registration, and during truck drivertesting. Fourth, the petitioner asked that NHTSA mail to each registeredowner of a motor vehicle to which Standard No. 120 applied (except motorcycles)the safety charts, warning labels, and cards. The vehicle owners wouldbe asked to place this literature and the labels in or on the vehicles.After extensive review, NHTSA has decided to deny Redco's petition forthe reasons set forth below. This denial notice explains the problems thatwould be associated with the implementation of the petitioner's suggestions,and why NHTSA has concluded that implementation of these suggestions wouldnot significantly reduce the problem of explosive separations during servicing.However, this denial should not be interpreted as a determination thatexplosive separations during the servicing of multi-piece and single piecewheels do not need to be, or cannot be, reduced. Instead, NHTSA believesthat means such as the distribution of the rim servicing pamphlet shouldmake the servicing of these tire rims safer. Moreover, the agency encouragesthe rim manufacturers, both domestic and foreign, to continue their effortsto distribute safety information to the servicers. At the outset, NHTSA notes that it has the statutory authority to requirecharts and warning labels to be placed into, attached onto, or to otherwiseaccompany a new motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment at orbefore the time of first purchase. 15 USC 1392, 1401(d). However, the agencydoes not have the authority to require that this material be maintainedwith a vehicle, be sent to a vehicle owner (absent a finding of a safetyrelated defect or noncompliance with a safety standard), or be distributedby a state agency. In addition, OSHA (instead of NHTSA) has the authorityto regulate the servicing of wheel rims under section 6(b) of the OccupationalSafety and Health Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1593. 29 U.S.C. 655). The most important practical shortcoming of Redco's suggestions is thatplacing the servicing information in the cab or disseminating the informationto the drivers and/or owners of the vehicles fails to target the safetyinformation to the group most at risk: the servicers of the wheel rims.For instance, the ODI data on multi-piece rim accidents between 1980 and1985 revealed that at least 40 percent of the reported accidents occurredwhile the wheel was neither on nor near the vehicle. This data also revealedthat a majority of the accident victims were not tire servicers, and theagency was not able to identify any accident where a driver or an ownerwas servicing or had serviced a wheel involved in an explosive separation.Because it is unlikely that the drivers or owners of the vehicles willservice the wheel assemblies, the suggestions in this petition to distributesafety information to the owners and drivers of vehicles would not reachthe personnel who are at risk (i.e. those who actually service the rims.)Accordingly, NHTSA concludes that Redco's first proposal to include theOSHA chart in the vehicle cab and its second proposal to attach a warninglabel in the cab would likely be ineffective. These two suggestions dolittle or nothing to provide safety information to the population mostat risk, the servicers of wheel rims, who generally do not need to enterthe cabs while servicing the rims. Part of Redco's second suggestion called for the placement of warning labelson the trailer frame near the wheels. NHTSA notes that it only has thestatutory authority to require the placement of such labels on new vehicles.Even if the warning labels were placed on a new trailer, the wheel assembliesfrequently are serviced away from the trailer. Further, those vehiclescurrently in production are equipped with newer-design wheels that areless likely than earlier designs to have explosive separations during servicing.As noted above, 90 percent of reported accidents from explosive separationsinvolve old design wheel assemblies that are over ten years old. The petitioner'ssuggestions would have little effect in remedying the problem of explosivewheel separations involving older rims. NHTSA also declines to propose Redco's third suggestion to have the Departmentof Transportation for each state distribute wheel service information atweigh in stations, during vehicle registration, and during truck drivertests. Under the principles of Federalism, the individual states make theirown decisions about whether to distribute vehicle performance information.Thus, NHTSA cannot require state entities to distribute performance informationfor motor vehicles. Moreover, as with Redco's other suggestions, this onetargets the vehicle owner and driver rather than the wheel servicer, whois most at risk. NHTSA also was not persuaded by Redco's fourth suggestion, which askedthe agency to send labels and cards containing tire rim service informationto each individual who owns a vehicle (other than a motorcycle) with tiresor rims subject to Standard No. 120. In the requested mailing, the agencywould have urged voluntary compliance with the OSHA tire rim servicingstandard. Such a measure again targets the vehicle owners rather than thewheel servicers. The large costs associated with this suggestion also arenot the best use of NHTSA's limited resources, because the agency wouldhave to identify the large number of vehicle owners subject to StandardNo. 120 and mail the safety information to them. Under a subpart of its fourth suggestion, Redco further requested NHTSAto mandate that all new vehicles contain the charts and warning labels.As noted above, such a measure would be ineffective because it targetsthe vehicle owners and drivers rather than the rim servicers. In addition,it would focus on new vehicles, while most of the reported problems havebeen with older vehicles and older rims. NHTSA concludes that there is not a reasonable possibility that the orderrequested by Redco would be issued at the conclusion of a rulemaking proceeding.The petitioner has not shown that the agency should amend Standard No.120 to require that the agency distribute servicing information and warninglabels to the owners and drivers of motor vehicles that are subject toStandard No. 120. Further, the other requested actions would not be likelyto significantly reduce the number of explosive separations during tireand rim servicing. Accordingly, the Redco petition is denied.<ITAG tagnum="20">(15 U.S.C. 1392, 1401, 1407, 1410a, 1421, 1423, delegation of authorityat 49 CFR 1.50)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on May 10, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Barry Felrice,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Associate Administrator for Rulemaking. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-11777 Filed 5-16-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4910-59-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
