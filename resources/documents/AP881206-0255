OSHA inspectors found the alleged violations after an inspectionat the landing gear shop at Miami International Airport. Theinspection began June 7.   Eastern officials will meet with OSHA Dec. 21 to discuss theproposed fine, company spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said.   Eastern last year took ``corrective measures to make sure noemployees were exposed to this substance'' by changing the procedurefor stripping landing gears, Ceremsak said.   Following the OSHA inspection, Eastern sent workers potentiallyexposed to cadium to hospitals for medical tests, Ceremsak said. Thetests determined the workers had suffered no toxic effects, she said.   The Machinists union could not be reached for comment immediately.   ``Cadmium has long been recognized as an industrial health hazardthat can cause serious kidney and lung damage and may causecancer,'' said Jose Sanchez, OSHA's Fort Lauderdale-area director.``OSHA is committed to minimizing worker exposure to cadmium andother harmful substances.''   OSHA inspectors found employees who grind landing gear componentswere exposed to cadmium dust levels up to 60 times the permissiblelevel. About 20 workers were employed in the area where theconditions were found.   The inspectors learned that in 1987, an Eastern environmentalhealth expert had recommended the installation of engineeringcontrols in the shop to limit cadmium dust exposure. But companyofficials did not follow the recommendation, OSHA said.   The agency cited Eastern for seven alleged ``willfulviolations,'' proposing a $10,000 penalty for each _ the maximumallowed by law. It also cited the airline for two alleged ``seriousviolations,'' carrying fines of $900 and $720, for lesserinfractions.   The willful violations allege the airline failed to: informworkers they were exposed to cadmium; provide an effectiverespiratory protection program; adequately test the respirators;prohibit storage and consumption of food and beverages in areascontaminated with cadmium dust; keep cadmium levels at or below themandated OSHA limits; and use engineering controls and exhaustventilation to control exposure to the dust.   OSHA defines a willful violation as one in which the violatoreither knew that a condition constituted a violation or was awarethat a hazardous condition existed and made no reasonable effort tocorrect it. A serious condition is one in which there was asubstantial probability that a death or serious injury could occurand the employer knew or should have known about it.   Eastern has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposedpenalties before the independent Occupational Safety and HealthReview Commission.</TEXT></DOC>
