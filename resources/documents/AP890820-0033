The parliament also questioned Interior Minister Ali AkbarMohtashemi, a leading hard-liner dropped from a newly proposedCabinet, the reports said. They gave no details on what he wasasked, however.   The new President Hashemi Rafsanjani dropped Mohtashemi from hisproposed list of Cabinet members in an effort to keep anti-Westernradicals out of government and install a team of more pragmatictechnocrats.   Heavy Industries Mininister Behzad Nabavi was also dropped fromthat list. However, his early ouster by Parliament would have beenthe first time the body fired a minister.   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,said 123 deputies voted in favor of dropping the no-confidencemotion against Nabavi, with 73 voting for it and 21 abstentions.   Opponents of the motion criticized a parliamentary inquiry thatconcluded Nabavi had effectively aided the scandal at the automobileplant by not acting swiftly against it, the agency said.   The call for his dismissal came in a 60-page report resultingfrom the inquiry. The report was signed by four parliamentarydeputies, the agency said.   Nabavi, 47, has served in the Cabinet since 1980.   The eight-hour debate in the parliament, or Majlis, replaced aplanned discussion of Rafsanjani's proposed 22-member Cabinet. Eachproposed member must be approved by a majority of deputies.   The official news agency quoted a deputy from the northernAzerbaijan province, Habib Borumand, as sayig Mohtashemi hadviolated Majlis regulations by failing to show up within 20 days toanswer the queries.   However, the majority of parlementarians have supportedMohtashemi in the past. On Friday, more than 138 deputies submitteda petition asking the new president, considered the leader of therival pragmatist faction, to reinstate the hard-liner.   According to the news agency, the attacks on Nabavi stem from theconviction of nine people for embezzling $360 million. They werefound guilty of illegally selling cars made at the Saipa plant onthe black market and overcharging for cars ordered by governmentorganizations.   The factory's former director, Touraj Mansour, was fined about$170 million and sentenced to 70 lashes as well as a suspendedeight-year jail term.   The plant, which manufactures cars under license from the FrenchRenault company, is operated by the heavy industries ministry.   However, Nabavi told the Majlis on Sunday that he was reallyunder attack for other reasons, such as his support for governmentrationing of basic goods, the news agency said.   ``This is not the way to treat a minister just a week before hecompletes nine years of serving in the Cabinet,'' he was quoted assaying.   The agency said the no-confidence motion was defeated afterquestions were raised about the parliamentary inquiry'sobjectiveness, lack of evidence linking Nabavi with the fraud, andhis reputation as one of the government's most competent ministers.</TEXT></DOC>
