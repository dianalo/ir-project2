The alternatives selected in the Record of Decision are: (1) Upgrade the existing Multipurpose Range Complex (MPRC);  (2) Locate the new Mobilization and Training Equipment Site (MATES) facilityat the Orchard Site; and  (3) Locate the new Ammunition Storage Point (ASP) at the Orchard site.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The National Guard Bureau and the IdahoMilitary Division (IDARNG) have selected the alternatives of upgradingthe MPRC and locating the MATES and the ASP at the Orchard site.  In accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations concerningtiering, the FEIS is limited to three specific proposed construction projectsand is tiered to the FEIS for Snake River Birds of Prey (SRBOPA) preparedby the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Department of Interior, in 1979.The BLM prepared that FEIS for the establishment of the SRBOPA of whichOrchard Training Area is a part. The FEIS evaluated the effect of IDARNGongoing training on the raptors and their habitat, concluding that ``25years of National Guard use has had no known effects on the birds of prey''.The National Guard began training on the area in 1953 under a Special LandUse Permit issued by the BLM. An Environmental Assessment was preparedin 1973 by the BLM to analyze National Guard training activities. ThisEnvironmental Asessment concluded that the training was compatible. Inorder to avoid future conflicts with nesting bird of prey and to minimizesoil erosion, the size of the training area was reduced by moving the boundaryaway from the Snake River Canyon rim.  The decisions made by the National Guard are based on the need to updatethe existing training facility. Upgrading the existing Multipurpose RangeComplex will provide state-of-the-art training for the troops. Reclocationand upgrading of existing support facilities closer to the Orchard TrainingArea (OTA) will save training time and expense.  In the FEIS, the following alternatives were evaluated:  (1) No Action (status quo continuance of ongoing IDARNG training activitiesat the OTA);  (2) Locating the MATES and the ASP at the Owyhee site;  (3) Locating the MATES and the ASP at the Orchard site; and  (4) Upgrading the MPRC.  Under the no action alternative, impacts and benefits of the ongoing trainingin the specific locations proposed for the new facilities would continue.The construction traffic would not occur as with the action alternatives.Also, there would not occur the benefits of construction employment, theincrease in permanent jobs, and the savings in fuel and training time expenses. The major effects of the action alternative at the Owyhee site would bethe loss of 17 acres of wildlife habitat, withdrawal of 20 acres of grazingland, and the consumption of 3 million gallons of groundwater annually.At the Owyhee site ferruginous hawks, a candidate for threated species,nest on power poles between the proposed MATES and ASP locations. The hawksmay be disturbed by the construction and operation of these facilities.Other social and economic effects include the addition of approximately130 construction jobs for 12 to 15 months, the addition of 75 permanentjobs, and the savings of 11,000 work hours and $500,000 in equipment andfuel annually.  The major effects of the action alternative at the Orchard site would bethe loss of 17 acres of wildlife habitat. However, since the location ofthe MATES at this site would be outside the SRBOPA, only 8 acres wouldbe lost from the SRBOPA. Additional effects include the withdrawal of 20acres of grazing land and the consumption of 3 million gallons of groundwaterannually. Since this site lies in the Mountain Home Groundwater ManagementArea, the Idaho Department of Water Resources will require substantiationthat adequate water is available and no previous rights would be impacted.Social and economic impacts would be the same as at the Owyhee Site.Due to the possible disturbance of the candidate threatened species andthe greater loss of habitat in the SRBOPA at the Owyhee site, the Orchardsite was selected as the preferred location. The alternative to upgrade the MPRC would result in the permanent lossof 2 acres of wildlife habitat. Although training levels might increaseat the MPRC, this would be balanced by less training in other areas ofthe OTA. The no action alternative, which is status quo continuance ofexisting conditions and activities, was not selected. All practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from thealternatives selected have been adopted. To mitigate the loss of two acresof wildlife habitat at the MPRC and 17 acres of wildlife habitat at theMATES and ASP facilities, land leased from the state (and adjacent to theSRBOPA) at the Orchard Site will preserve 120 acres of similar wildlifeand raptor habitat. Furthermore, the IDARNG Environmental Management Program,under the direction of an Environmental Specialist, will continue to developand implement mitigation for training-related impacts. Under a Memorandumof Understanding between the IDARNG and the BLM, yearly meetings are heldto monitor the impacts of training and mitigation actions. During the past five years, the BLM and IDARNG have identified resourcemanagement issues and implemented mitigation measures: (1) To mitigate mechanical damage, the IDARNG has limited its use of southernsectors of the training area to reduce possible disturbance of nestingraptors in the canyon and reduce impacts on erosive soils; (2) The IDARNG conducts an environmental awareness briefing for troopsusing the OTA; (3) To mitigate wildfire impacts, the IDARNG has stationed four fire-truckswithin the OTA to suppress fires within the impact area, future plans includethe purchase of a helicopter-mounted water tank and an agreement with BLMto suppress fires in the SRBOPA outside the OTA; (4) To rehabilitate disturbed habitat, the IDARNG, under the directionof the BLM, has re-seeded 2,500 acres within the OTA, and more rehabilitationis planned for the future; and (5) To mitigate noise impacts which could disturb the raptors, the IDARNGdoes not conduct live firing exercises during prime morning and eveningraptor hunting periods. In response to public comment on the need for assessing the impacts ofongoing training, the BLM, IDARNG, the Governor of Idaho, and the NationalGuard Bureau have signed a joint policy statement in which an agreementis made to develop an intensive four-year research project on the impactsof military training in the SRBOPA. At the conclusion of the study period,BLM will lead a full National Environmental Policy Act review which willexamine the impacts of all uses of the SRBOPA. In preparation for thisresearch, the IDARNG participated in an interdisciplinary-team workshopconvened by the BLM to assess information needs for the long-term managementand preservation of the SRBOPA.<ITAG tagnum="6">Donald Burdick,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Major General, GS, Director, Army National Guard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Darrell V.
