 If you're not intouch with the real world that exists outside your office, you're not doingyour job.andM;Happily, the PC can serve as a powerful conduit for information from theworld at large.andP;  With your PC and a modem, you can search through hundreds ofonline and CD-ROM databases for specific facts--from the most recent salesfigures of your competitors to the winning times of the last 50 BostonMarathons.andP;  &quot;In 15 minutes, you can get someone's life story,&quot; says AlfredGlossbrenner, author of How to Look It Up Online.andP;  &quot;Sometimes I feel like avoyeur.&quot;andM;The Information JungleandM;The first step in approaching online research is to determine whether youneed to go online at all.andP;  You can often find answers to simple, specificqueries with a quick call to your local public library.andP;  If your needs aremore complex, however, there's no substitute for an electronic database.andM;Once you've decided to take the online route, the next step is to decide whoshould actually perform the search.andP;  If you work for a large company, chancesare you have at your disposal a whole department that specializes insearching electronic databases.andP;  Take advantage of it.andP;  Like referencelibrarians, inhouse research departments are especially good at ferreting outanswers to specific questions--for example, what were the annual sales ofCompany X in 1972?andM;If you don't have access to an inhouse research team, you'll have to hire anoutside information broker or do it yourself.andP;  Researchers-for-hire typicallysubscribe to many on-line databases and are experts at using them.andP;  Theyoften have specialists in many fields on hand, or they may subcontract asearch to an expert in the area in question.andP;  Their instantly availableexpertise makes information brokers good for assembling a quick briefing on asubject that you know little or nothing about.andP;  For a listing of brokers, trythe Directory of Fee-Based Information Services from Burwell Enterprises, inHouston.andM;If you already know something about the topic, you may be better off doingthe search yourself.andP;  You know the terms and you may recognize the citations.andO;If your topic is ill defined, or if you're making up the questions as you goalong, you'll probably have to do it yourself.andP;  Computerized databaseservices are highly interactive, but a designated searcher can't possiblyknow which tangential leads you'd want to follow.andP;  Delegating yourinformation searches &quot;is like having someone else do your spreadsheets,&quot; saysTom Davenport, director of research at The Index Group, a research andconsulting firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts.andM;Information research involves a delicate give-and-take that can be lost whendelegated.andP;  &quot;This is an interactive mind sport,&quot; says Glossbrenner.andP;  &quot;You'reconstantly playing an 'I wonder if' game.andP;  You have to be involved mentally.&quot;andO;But be careful: going it alone exposes you to all the expense and frustrationthat professional searchers spend years learning to minimize.andM;Help Is on the WayandM;Imagine yourself sitting in front of your PC, your modem all fired up andequipped with fresh passwords from information powerhouses such as Dialog,Nexis, BRS, and Dow Jones News/Retrieval.andP;  In short, you are poised tosquander your money on everything from connect time to search fees.andM;This often happens to online novices.andP;  The databases are so vast and thequery formats so unnatural that even hardened DOS-jockeys can get lost whiletrying to wade their way through.andP;  To make it easier, the major onlineservices are beginning to add friendly front ends, and several companies haveintroduced helpful PC software packages.andM;The most advanced front end is probably Dow Jones News/Retrieval's Dow Quest,which uses interactive programs running on supercomputers that act as filtersbetween you and the News/Retrieval database.andP;  As you continue to performsearches, the system adapts to your requests, helping you refine your focus.andM;Telebase Systems' EasyNet acts as an easy, standardized gateway through whichyou can gain access to more than 800 databases.andP;  Also available as InfoMasterfrom Western Union and IQuest from CompuServe, EasyNet includes special menufunctions and scan utilities to help you find the right database.andP;  It chargesa standard fee for the first group of hits, no matter how many it finds.andO;That can help reduce unexpected bills generated by queries that are toobroad.andM;PC software can also ease the search process.andP;  Pro-Search, a $495 packagefrom Personal Bibliographic Software, translates database query languagesinto something approximating English and leads you through the search processoffline so that you're prepared by the time you log on.andP;  Pro-search workswith the popular Dialog and BRS database services.andM;Database-on-a-DeskandM;Along with friendly front ends, CD-ROM databases are the other major advancein electronic research.andP;  CD-ROM (compact disc/read-only memory) worksparticularly well for archival information.andM;The key to making CD-ROM pay off is frequency of use.andP;  Online databasescharge by the search or by the hit, whereas you buy unlimited access to aCD-ROM database with an up-front charge or monthly service fee.andM;A CD-ROM drive for your PC costs about $1,000, and database disc prices rangefrom less than $100 to several thousand dollars.andP;  For $950, for example, youcan browse at your leisure through the Oxford English Dictionary, fromTriStar Publishing.andP;  Ellis Enterprises sells a disc containing nine versionsof the Bible for $595.andP;  For the ultimate in raw demographics, you can get the$990 Supermap from Chadwyck-Healey--a complete, county-by-county breakdown ofthe 1980 U.S.andP;  census.andM;Obviously, it doesn't make sense to pay all that money if you're going to usethe database only occasionally.andP;  But if the demand is there, CD-ROM databasescan significantly lower the per-search costs for electronic research.andM;Just as important, CD-ROM takes the pressure out of electronicsearching--which makes it especially useful for your first forays into a newtopic.andP;  You can pick up some of the jargon of the field, learn who the bigplayers are, and formulate intelligent questions--all without worrying abouttelephone bills, access charges, and hit fees.andM;CD-ROM databases help democratize information searching.andP;  At the Cambridge,Massachusetts, consulting firm Arthur D. Little, for example, marketresearchers and analysts who must rely on librarians to do their onlinesearches are permitted to walk right up a CD-ROM station and dig in.andP;  Oneoutplacement counseling firm now lets its clients research potentialemployers themselves, using CD-ROM databases, rather than funneling theirqueries to an outside research outfit.andM;On the other hand, if you're looking for the most up-to-date informationavailable, you're probably better off doing it online.andP;  Online services areupdated every week, every day, or even more often, while most CD-ROM servicessupply new discs only monthly or quarterly.andP;  And while the variety of CD-ROMdatabases is growing quickly, they still can't deliver the depth and scope ofinformation available online.andM;The Personal NewspaperandM;Typically, probing an online or CD-ROM database is like using your PC tospear elusive facts lurking deep in the murky oceans of irrelevantinformation.andP;  For many purposes, however, what you want is not a harpoon buta net, to collect information relating to a particular subject continually.andM;Say you want to know everything your competitor does, every day.andP;  Severaldatabase services let you keep constant tabs on a number of topics.andP;  Theyautomatically &quot;clip&quot; items pertaining to those topics and send them your way.andO;Thus, you could assemble a daily &quot;newspaper&quot; containing only stories you areinterested in: anything from arms control to solar energy to your majorbusiness rival.andM;CompuServe, Dow Jones News/Retrieval, and Dialog all offer such tailoredinformation services.andP;  And a growing number of large companies are puttingtogether in-house executive information systems (most of themmainframe-based) that supply top managers with this kind of customized newsdigest.andM;Such selectivity raises an important issue, however.andP;  Even while opening upvast stores of data, PCs can also act as blinders, blocking your peripheralvision as you single-mindedly pursue a lead.andP;  Computer searches rule out theserendipity that often accompanies and old-fashioned browse through printedmatter.andP;  True, the computer will find the needle in the haystack for you, butit won't tell you the treasures you've burrowed past on the way.andM;Sticking with PaperandM;That limitation is one reason some research-intensive organizations still doa lot of their digging through paper.andP;  At Time magazine, for example, theresearch staff keeps comprehensive files of clips from all kinds ofpublications.andP;  When a story breaks, researchers get much of the necessarybackground from these clip files.andM;Time's researchers say it is far more effective to scan through a stack of100 clipped articles than to do a computer search on the topic.andP;  Hard-copyclippings offer a host of visual cues--headlines, graphics, even the feel andweight of the paper--that can help you quickly assess whether a document willfit your needs.andP;  The computer screen squeezes out these peripheral sensoryclues, imposing on the information a visual monotony that can hamper yoursearch.andM;Despite this shortcoming, a properly used PC can keep you informed betterthan any other piece of technology can.andP;  Dialog's suite of databases alonecontains 800 billion characters, with enough information to produce a stackof printouts a mile high.andP;  Using a personal computer without nibbling fromthis cornucopia is like driving a car without ever leaving the parking lot.andO;You're not getting your money's worth.andP;  And you're not going anywhere.andM;Ten Ways to Find It FasterandM;TIPSandM;Searching an online database can be rewarding, but to the uninitiated it canalso be confusing, scary, and needlessly expensive.andP;  Careful prepration andplanning can ease first-timers' fears help keep costs in line, and increaseyour chances of finding the information you seek.andP;  These ten steps areadapted from How to Look It Up Online by Alfred Glossbrenner:andM;1 Select a database.andP;  One good source is the Directory of Online Databases,published by Cuadra/Elsevier.andP;  The 1989 edition lists more than 4,000databases covering all manner of topics.andM;2 Read the documentation.andP;  Discipline yourself to do this every time yousearch a database, until you know the system so well that you don't have tothink about it.andP;  Logging on to a database and waiting to see where you end upwill cost you a mint online.andP;  Even better than reading the manual on yourown, attend a training class.andM;3 Meditate.andP;  If you ride in like a cowboy with six-guns blazing, firing offsearch terms as they come into your head, you'll stir up a lot of dust, use alot of ammunition, and end up with a hefty bill but very  little relevantinformation.andM;4 Select which fields to search.andP;  The &quot;author&quot; field may be useless in adatabase of general-interest magazines but crucial in a database of books.andO;As a rule, use just three or four fields.andM;5 Write out your first search statement in full before you start.andP;  Onceyou're online, you'll have plenty of other things to think about.andM;6 Verify how to sign off.andP;  Don't be trapped online with the meter tickingwhile you frantically look up the sign-off code.andM;7 Check the display settings.andP;  Make sure the information will appear onscreenthe way you want it to look.andM;8 Set your computer to capture incoming information.andP;  If you don't have ahard disk, have a floppy ready to capture the session.andM;9 Prepare search expanders and restricters.andP;  If your first search gets toomany hits, narrow it by adding qualifiers.andP;  If you get too few hits, broadenthe search by adding synonyms.andM;10 Log off and write your captured material to disk.andP;  Don't hesitate to logoff and on frequently.andP;  Most services don't impose a sign-on fee.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
