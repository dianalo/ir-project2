In the Yule analysis the sunspot number for a givenyear is a function of those for the two preceding years and a presumedrandom disturbance. However, the disturbances are not random and changesign at approximately 40 y intervals. The Yule methodology developedinto what is now known as autoregressive time series analysis, in whichthe emphasis is on prediction and periodicity analysis. This study, bycontrast, emphasizes the disturbances, and relates their temporal behaviorto the shifts in latitudinal preferences observed in auroral occurrence.That is, auroral occurrence would be preferentially in the South fora time and then shift, over a relatively short period of time, to theNorth. The shift was observed in data from both Sweden and the UnitedStates. This behavior would then be repeated over subsequent intervals.The present paper compares the North/South behavior of Swedish auroraswith the disturbances deduced from a Yule analysis of sunspots for approximatelythe past two centuries. Overall, the northward movements occur duringperiods of low disturbances, and the southward movements during periodsof high disturbances. It is proposed here that the general magnetic fieldof the sun, reflected also in the interplanetary field, joins the twophenomena.</TEXT></DOC>
