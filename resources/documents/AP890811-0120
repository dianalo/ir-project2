The Tass news agency said 26 businesses in the republic'scapital of Tallinn were affected in the walkout by the non-Estonianworkers. Strikes also were reported in the mining town ofKohtla-Yarve.   Tass said walkouts among railway workers were ``the mostdangerous'' because they were impeding the flow of coal shipmentsthat pass through Tallinn's port. It said 26,000 people werestriking in Tallinn.   The strike began after the Estonian Parliament on Tuesdaytightened residency requirements for voting and holding electedoffice in the Baltic republic.   Under the new law, residents of Estonia must live in the samedistrict for at least two years, or have lived anywhere in therepublic for a total of five years, to be able to vote.   Candidates for elective office must live in the same place forfive years, or in Estonia for 10 years.   Non-Estonian residents of the republic, including leaders of theRussian-dominated InterMovement group, complain the law is aimedagainst them because many are new arrivals. They launched a proteststrike the day after it was passed.   The Estonian leadership, in a statement published Friday,``acknowledged that it failed to `take into account fully thegrowth of national consciousness among the non-Estonian populationof the republic,''' Tass reported.   Estonian government and party leaders blamed themselves for``arousing mistrust'' among the population, it said. They alsoaccused strike leaders of trying to stir up ethnic unrest andintimidate the non-Estonian population, Tass said.   The Estonian Parliament issued a ban on strikes Thursday, butstrike leaders said they considered the move illegal and had noplans to halt the walkouts.   The Parliament did not say how strikers would be punished,mentioning only vague ``administrative and criminal measures'' andthe drafting of a tougher law on strikes.   Alexander Yakushev, a strike committee member, said in atelephone interview from Tallinn that local officials were meetingwith strikers but that the talks could not be considerednegotiations.   Ethnic Estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of thepopulation and had pushed for the election law to protectthemselves from an influx of Russians and members of other Sovietethnic groups.</TEXT></DOC>
