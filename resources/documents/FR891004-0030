Introduction</ITAG>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announces its intent to deleteThe Taylor Borough Superfund Site from the National Priorities List (NPL),Appendix B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan(NCP), and requests comments on this deletion. The EPA identifies sitesthat appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, orthe environment and maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Siteson the NPL may be the subject to Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund(Fund) financed remedial actions. Any site deleted from the NPL remainseligible for Fund-financed remedial actions in the unlikely event thatfuture conditions at the site warrant such action.EPA intends to delete The Taylor Borough site from the NPL. The EPA willaccept comments on this site for thirty days after publication of thisnotice in the ``Federal Register.''Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites fromthe NPL. Section III discusses procedures that EPA is using for this action.Section IV discusses the site and explains how the site meets the deletioncriteria.<ITAG tagnum="21">The Agency believes it is appropriate to review all sites being consideredor proposed for deletion from the NPL, including the site being noticetoday, to determine whether the requirement for a five-year review (underCERCLA section 121(c)) applies. This is consistent with the intent of thestatement in the Administrator's <T3>Management Review of the Superfund Program</T3> (the ``90-day Study''),that ``EPA will modify Agency policy so that no site, where hazardous substancesremain, will be deleted from the NPL until at least one five year reviewis conducted and the review indicates that the remedy remains protectiveof human health and the environment.'' EPA will shortly issue its policyon when and how five-year review sites may be deleted from the NPL. Thispolicy may have an effect on the timing of site deletions proposed in thisand other notices.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">II. NPL Deletion Criteria</ITAG>Recent amendments to the NCP establish the criteria the Agency uses todelete sites from the NPL, as published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 20, 1985 (50 FR 47912). Section 300.66(c)(7)of the NCP provides that sites<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * may be deleted from or recategorized in the NPL where no furtherresponse is appropriate.</ITAG>In making this determination EPA will consider whether any of the followingcriteria has been met:(I) EPA in consultation with the State has determined that responsibleor other parties have implemented all appropriate response actions required.(II) All appropriate Fund-financed response under CERCLA has been implementedand EPA in consultation with the State has determined that no further cleanupby responsible parties is appropriate; or(III) Based on a remedial investigation, EPA in consultation with the Statehas determined that the release poses no significant threat to public healthor the environment and, therefore, taking of remedial measures is not appropriate.Before deciding to delete a site, EPA will make a determination that theremedy or decision that no remedy is necessary is protective of publichealth, welfare, and the environment considering environmental requirementsthat are applicable or relevant and appropriate at the time of the deletion.Deletion of the site from the NPL does not preclude eligibility for subsequentFund-financed actions if future conditions warrant such actions. Section300.66(c)(8) of the NCP states that Fund-financed actions may be takenat sites that have been deleted from the NPL.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Deletion Procedures</ITAG>Deletions of sites from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revokeany individual's rights or obligations. The NPL is designed primarily forinformational purposes and to assist agency management. As is mentionedin Section II of this notice, Section 300.66(c)(8) of the NCP makes clearthat deletion of a site from the NPL does not preclude eligibility forfuture Fund-financed response actions.EPA will solicit public comment on the proposed deletion of The TaylorBorough Site for thirty days. The comments received during the notice andcomment period will be evaluated before the final decision to delete ismade.A decision will occur after U.S. EPA Region III places a notice in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>. The NPL will reflect any deletion in the nextupdate. Public notices and copies of the responsiveness summary will bemade available to the local residents by the Regional Office.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion</ITAG>The Taylor Borough Site is located in Taylor Borough, Lackawanna County,Pennsylvania. This site had been extensively mined for anthracite coalby both strip and underground mining operations. Following the mining operations,the unreclaimed strip mine pits were used as a municipal landfill. Recordsfrom the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (PADER) alsodocument the disposal of industrial wastes during the 1960's. After thelandfill operation ceased, drummed industrial wastes were found on thesurface of the site.During September through November of 1983, EPA removed approximately 1,200drums from the site. A Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study Reportwas initiated in March 1984 and completed in May 1985 by EPA. This reportdescribed the necessary remedial actions for this site as follows: removaland off-site disposal to a qualifying facility under the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act (RCRA) 40 CFR part 264, Subpart N of approximately 125crushed and intact drums and remnants remaining on the surface or partiallyburied; collection and treatment of contaminated surface water in Ponds1 and 2; excavation of contaminated soils and wastes from former Drum StorageAreas Nos. 1 and 2 and sediments in Ponds Nos. 1 and 2 for off-site disposalto a qualified RCRA facility; proper backfilling and placement of a 24inch soil cover over: (a) former drum storage areas 3 and 6 and the entirearea in between, and (b) former drum storage area 4 and installation ofa chain link fence aroound the perimeter of both soil covered areas. Sinceno releases of site contaminants to the groundwater or to the St. John'sCreek has been documented there is no need for remediation of either ofthese waters, however, a monitoring program is warranted to verify overtime that no release is occurring. Specifically identified groundwaterwells on site will be monitored on a semi-annual basis and the St. John'sCreek will be monitored on an annual basis, both for a minimum five yearperiod as part of Operation and Maintenance activities. PADER has agreedwith these remedial actions.During the time period July 1987 through May 1988 a group of PotentiallyResponsible Parties (PRPs) performed the required remedial actions identifiedabove. EPA was on-site every day during this time period overseeing thework and verifying that the work was performed according to the EPA approvedRemedial Design. On December 23, 1988 EPA sent a letter to the PRPs whoperformed the remedial actions certifying that the work was completed toEPA's satisfaction. Operation and Maintenance acivities will be initiatedat the Site beginning Spring 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 31, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Stanley L.
