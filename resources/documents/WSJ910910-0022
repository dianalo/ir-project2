Inc. filed a reorganization planin which they would get 100% ownership of the drugstorechain, in return for agreeing to lighten the company's $1.5billion debt load.   The creditors' plan comes three months after Revcomanagement put forth its own plan. Twinsburg, Ohio-basedRevco has been operating under Chapter 11 protection of thefederal Bankruptcy Code since July 1988. Repeated efforts toreorganize the company's finances and get the company out ofChapter 11 have been stymied by arguments among variouscreditors and advisers, and by deterioration in Revco'sresults.</LP><TEXT>   The latest plan also calls for Salomon Brothers Inc. topay $9.5 million to Revco creditors, in return for creditors'agreement to drop various proposed suits against the New Yorkinvestment bank. Salomon had advised Revco to undertake aleveraged buy-out in 1986; Salomon collected almost $40million in fees at the time.   A spokeswoman for Revco said she hadn't seen thecreditors' plan and couldn't comment in detail about how itcompared with management's plan. But she said &quot;there isn't aconfrontation&quot; between the two plans. &quot;Our goal is to supportany plan that is feasible and can be confirmed&quot; by thebankruptcy court reviewing Revco's situation, she added.   One of Revco's major bondholders, Talton Embry of MagtenAsset Management, also voiced hope that the latestreorganization plan -- or something close to it -- willsucceed. The three-year Revco restructuring &quot;has taken on alife of its own,&quot; Mr. Embry conceded. &quot;But this certainlyshould be a good place for everyone to work from.&quot;   In the creditors' plan, banks that have lent Revco $306million would get $205 million of new 12% notes due Dec. 31,1988, a small amount of cash and some new convertiblepreferred stock. Revco's bank debt lately has been quoted atabout 60 cents on the dollar-traders' estimate of what therestructuring package will be worth.   Investors in Revco's junk bonds wouldn't do so well in thecredtors' plan. Holders of $432.5 million in seniorsubordinated notes, for example, would get only stock in apost-bankruptcy Revco. They wouldn't get any cash or newnotes. In recent weeks, Revco's junk bonds have traded at 18cents on the dollar or even less, reflecting investors'belief that any eventual restructuring won't leave much forbondholders.   Holders of Revco common stock wouldn't get anything. Thosestockholders are essentially powerless, though, becausebondholders with a more senior claim to the company's assetsare being forced to make concessions.   The creditors' restructuring plan also covers the stockand debt of Anac Holding Corp., which is Revco's parent. Mostof Revco's debt is held in its own name, however, leadingcreditors and industry analysts to regard Revco, rather thanAnac, as the most significant entity being restructured.   For the year ended June 1, 1991, Revco had a $65 millionloss on revenue of $1.88 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
