Many of E. Gerald Corrigan's arguments for the proposal closely resemble some of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's recent remarks. Mr. Corrigan urged that bank holding companies be allowed to offer more services, that banking and commerce remain separated, and that certain functions &quot;special&quot; to banks be protected. Mr. Corrigan's proposal is to be published next month in the New York Fed's annual report.    The proposal is the latest of several, similar suggestions that have emerged from the heightening debate over the shape of the financial services industry. The Reagan administration and trade groups are pressing Congress to relax the 54-year-old legal barrier between commercial and investment banking, the Glass-Steagall Act.    Next week, the Fed is to hold hearings, expected to stretch over two days, on applications by three bank holding companies to underwrite debt-backed securities and municipal revenue bonds through subsidiaries that aren't banks. The Fed hopes to decide the cases by April.    While the Senate Banking Committee is considering legislation granting banks similar underwriting authority, as well as the ability to sponsor mutual funds, far-reaching regulatory reforms such as the one Mr. Corrigan suggests aren't likely to emerge from the current Congress.    Mr. Corrigan's proposals identify three major categories of &quot;diversified&quot; financial institutions: bank or thrift holding companies, financial holding companies, and non-bank financial companies. A fourth category of financial firms would be largely unaffected by the plan. These would consist of thousands of so-called &quot;stand-alone&quot; or undiversified banks, thrifts, insurance companies, brokers and other financialservice suppliers.    Mr. Corrigan said the restructuring is meant to preserve the distinctions between financial and commercial firms, strengthen the safety and soundness of the financial system, and create a supervisory structure that is based on functions performed by financial firms rather than their legal form. He proposed creation of a Financial Services Oversight Board, composed of the heads of &quot;appropriate&quot; regulatory agencies, that would supervise the new structure.    Under the restructuring, bank or thrift holding companies having one or more &quot;non-bank&quot; financial units could own and control one or more banks or thrifts and could eventually engage in insurance, securities and banking. These firms couldn't be owned or controlled by a nonfinancial, commercial concern or engage in nonfinancial activities.    Financial holding companies, which wouldn't own banks or thrifts, would have access -- at their option -- to both the nation's electronic payments network and the Federal Reserve's discount window, as long as they weren't themselves owned or controlled by commercial companies. In return for these privileges, they would have to maintain interest-bearing reserves at the Fed. Financial holding companies could choose to acquire banks or thrifts and thereby convert to bank or thrift holding companies.    Finally, non-bank financial companies that are owned and controlled by a commercial concern couldn't own or control banks or thrifts, but could offer non-bank financial services. However, they would be denied access to the payments system and the discount window. Commercial firms that currently own insured thrifts and so-called &quot;non-bank banks,&quot; which either make loans or accept deposits, but not both, would eventually be required to divest these holdings.    As part of the plan, Mr. Corrigan proposed:    --Eliminating the ban against paying interest on transaction deposits, such as corporate and most personal checking accounts.    --Paying interest on required reserves.    --Eliminating reserve requirements on time deposits held by anyone other than consumers.    --Making all transaction accounts, such as uninsured money market mutual funds with check-writing privileges, subject to reserve requirements under certain conditions. These accounts could be offered by bank and thrift holding companies and financial holding companies.    Incorporated in the Corrigan plan are measures aimed at reducing the risks of disruption in the nation's payment systems, including a requirement that all major direct participants in the large-dollar electronic payments network maintain interest-earning liquidity reserves. He also proposed creation of a National Electronic Payments Corp. that would be jointly owned and operated by the Fed and major private participants.    In remarks to a meeting of the New York State Bankers Association, Mr. Corrigan called the proposals a &quot;longer term vision, not a regulatory or legislative road-map for tomorrow morning.&quot;    Top officials at several big banks, including J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. and Citicorp, which have been active in pressing for financial industry reform that would enable them to expand their securities activities, cautiously welcomed Mr. Corrigan's proposals but stopped short of endorsing them.    Dennis Weatherstone, president of J.P. Morgan, said, &quot;the analysis seems constructive and farsighted and explores some good ideas, especially regarding functional regulation. Certainly some proposals, such as those related to the payments system, call for more study as does implementation in general.&quot;    Hans Angermueller, vice chairman of Citicorp, said the &quot;fact that someone as important as he is and as close a confidant of Fed Chairman Paul Volcker should propose a fundamental restructuring of the financial services system is significant. It seems to me the dialogue is starting and we'll be delighted to respond to Mr. Corrigan's ideas.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
