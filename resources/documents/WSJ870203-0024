U.S. trade officials, after meeting with British, French and West German officials here, said they are concerned that two proposed Airbus planes might enjoy an unfair advantage over American competitors. The U.S. officials called for further talks to clarify international trading rules on aircraft subsidies, such as the billions of dollars in government aid received by the European aircraft consortium.    But Geoffrey Pattie, a British trade and industry minister, said he found it &quot;slightly bizarre&quot; that the U.S., with about 80% of the world aircraft market, should object to some &quot;much-needed competition.&quot; He also said the &quot;thrust&quot; of yesterday's talks with the U.S. officials was &quot;threatening.&quot;    Airbus is seeking support from the three European governments to develop the A-340, a wide-bodied airliner designed for intercontinental routes, and a shorter-range sister craft, the A-330. The longer-range plane is intended to compete directly with a new McDonnell Douglas Corp. jumbo jet, the MD-11.    Airbus yesterday said it had booked orders for 97 of its commercial aircraft, worth a total of about $5 billion, in January. That included 15 firm orders and 15 options for the long-range A-340 from the German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG. </TEXT></DOC>
