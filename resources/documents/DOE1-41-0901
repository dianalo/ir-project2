A multi-stepanalog switch has an input connected to the summed-voltage output. Thenumber of steps of the switch is equal to the submultiple. The switchhas at least an output connection for each of the steps, and a resistancenetwork comprising individual resistors of differing value connectedat first ends to the respective outputs of the switch, the network havingan output connection in common to the opposite ends of the resistors.</TEXT></DOC>
