PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A team of American psychiatrists is embarking on atwo-week review of Soviet psychiatry including interviews with twodozen patients Western human rights activists suspect are being heldfor political reasons.   The Soviet Union says it has ended abuses and is interested inrejoining the World Psychiatry Association, from which it withdrewin 1983 under pressure from Western countries that accused it ofusing psychiatry for political purposes.   ``The purpose of our visit will be to assess, insofar as possibleand in a limited period of time, changes in Soviet policies, lawsand treatment practices in the field of forensic psychiatry,'' saidRobert W. Farrand, a U.S. State Department official leading the20-member team.   He described the visit, which ends March 12, as unprecedented.   Soviet human rights activists said recently that 20-30 mentallyhealthy people still are held in mental hospitals for politicalreasons.   Loren H. Roth, head of the Law and Psychiatry program at theUniversity of Pittsburgh and the medical leader, said the groupexpects to interview 25-30 Soviets whose cases have been raised byWestern human rights campaigners.   ``These are the patients whose cases are perhaps best known,'' hesaid.   Farrand told reporters Monday the Soviets are giving the groupaccess to all the patients whose cases they asked to review, butdelegation officials added there was no way they could ensure otherpeople unknown to human rights activists are not being held forpolitical reasons.   Delegation members said they have been given medical records formost of the patients, and expect to receive more before they beginexaminations.   Patients will be given a choice of speaking only to the Americangroup, or to have a Soviet psychiatrist present as well, they said.   The American group includes five psychiatrists who are formerSoviet citizens. They will conduct the interviews in Russian andscreen out any cultural bias in the examinations, the group said.   Patients will be tested for any drugs that are beingadministered, and the delegation has asked Soviet psychiatrists topresent the patients as they normally live.   The group eventually will issue a report on its findings, butwon't identify the patients to protect their privacy.   One official said the group planned to avoid publicity while inthe Soviet Union because ``the chemistry of this is very delicate.''   It also will visit two psychiatric hospitals that human rightsactivists say once held political prisoners and two that never havebeen so identified.   Delegation officials said the visits to the latter would allowthem to assess the general state of Soviet psychiatric care.   Abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union has been a contentiousissue between the superpowers for decades.   As part of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, some psychiatrichospitals were transferred from police control to control by theHealth Ministry. A new law made it a crime to commit a sane personto a mental hospital.   Last month, Georgy Morozov, head of the Soviet psychiatricsociety, said there were no more people held in psychiatrichospitals for political reasons.   Officials of the U.S. delegation said their investigation was notdirectly aimed at Moscow's effort to be readmitted to the worldassociation, but that the issue was likely to come up when theorganization meets in October.</TEXT></DOC>
