It was a test of strength that pitted Sunbelt states whosepopulations have been swollen by illegal aliens against Frostbeltstates that stand to lose House seats after the census.   By 232-184, the House used a parliamentary maneuver steered byRep. Silvio O. Conte, R-Mass., to keep the census measure off thefloor.   That was the vote by which the House instructed its negotiatorsin House-Senate talks to accept a provision in the Senate versionof the State, Justice and Commerce appropriations bill to condemnthe continuation in power of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in Panama.   The rules permit only one set of instructions to a conferencecommittee. Thus Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., was blocked from offeringhis own set of instructions on the census question to the Housemembers of the same committee.   Ridge's provisions would have ordered the House negotiators toaccept another Senate-passed provision, this one to barring the useof any money for the Census Bureau to count illegal aliens in its1990 head count.   The census bureau has always counted residents regardless ofcitizenship. Past efforts to exclude illegal aliens from the counthave always died in committee.   The matter is important to several northeastern and midwesternstates which expect to lose House seats in redistricting followingthat census.   Under current census rules, California, Florida and Texas, withmany illegal aliens, expect to gain House seats while New York,Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois are among those expectedto lose seats.   Even though it was apparent they would not have a chance to geta vote on the Ridge proposal, backers of the census change used thehour devoted to the Noriega censure to debate the census issue.   Ridge and others characterized it as a matter of politicalfairness. ``I want equal representation for American citizens,''argued Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa.   Opponents argued that any change in census rules at this pointwould cost $1 billion, including the cost of reprinting forms andretraining the enumerators. They said it was not clear that thecensus-takers could even get accurate information on citizenship.   Rep. William Ford, D-Ky., called it, ``A fantasy'' that stateslosing seats could save any by excluding aliens from the count.   Opponents have said the Senate provision is clearlyunconstitutional, since the Constitution requires a census of``persons.'' When the Constitution wants something to apply only tocitizens, it clearly says ``citizens,'' according to this argument.   Supporters have argued that the Constitution gives Congress thepower to impose rules for the Census.</TEXT></DOC>
