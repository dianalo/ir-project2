This formulation willbe examined in detail to understand whether it can be used in the developmentof well testing strategies for coal seams. This formulation is developedin radial-cylindrical coordinates and it describes the unsteady-statesorption and diffusion in the coal matrix, the mass transport betweenthe matrix and cleat systems and finally the laminar transport of gasin the cleat network. 15 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
