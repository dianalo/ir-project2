The paper describes theengineering systems set up by Amcoal as a result of its eight year'sexperience of draglines. Quality assurance is applied to the manufactureof dragline components, whether for a new machine or for spare partssupplied subsequently. More recently, Amcoal has become involved in discussionswith the machine supplier aimed at improving the quality of design incertain critical areas. The need to apply quality assurance techniquesin the erection of the machine, and also when any major repairs are carriedout, has been recognized. A common planned maintenance system is appliedto all Amcoal draglines and is carried out by the engineering departmentof each opencast mine. Monitoring of machine conditions is carried outat intervals. For the electrical drive systems this is done under contractby the local branch of the electrical equipment manufacturer. Monitoringof swing and propel drive torque oscillations and slow bearing load fluctuationshas been carried out by an independent consultant. In addition to thestandard machinery protection equipment, two continuous monitoring systemshave been added. One protects against fires, and the other against accidentalcollisions between bucket and boom.</TEXT></DOC>
