Long-distance rates have dropped, the quality of the telephonenetwork has remained high and new telecommunications products andservices are being offered to consumers faster than ever before, hesaid.   ``The key to all of this is competition,'' he said in aninterview with The Associated Press. ``Divestiture introducedcompetition, real competition, for the first time in thetelecommunications industry and ... it's bound to have a goodeffect.''   Greene took over the U.S. vs. ATandamp;T antitrust case in August 1978after the death of the original trial judge, Joseph C. Waddy, andcontinues to monitor the consent decree that settled the case to seethat the public interest is served.   Greene came to the case with a reputation as an activist, liberaljurist. He fled Nazi Germany with his family in 1939 at age 16, sawcombat in the Army during World War II, and later prosecuted civilrights cases for the Justice Department.   Working with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Greene draftedthe landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965.   Greene's objective in U.S. vs. ATandamp;T was to prove the competenceof the federal courts to manage effectively a major antitrust case.   In the interview, Greene acknowledged the consumer confusion thatresulted from the lawsuit that separated American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. from its local operating companies. He also noted that``it did take ATandamp;T and the local companies awhile to get their acttogether'' after the decree went into effect Jan. 1, 1984.   But, he said, ``favorable developments outweigh by far theproblems that have arisen.''   When ATandamp;T was the nation's major provider of local andlong-distance service, manufacturer of phone equipment andtelecommunications researcher, there was no pressure on it to rushnew products and services to the market, he said.   ``What they did do is to change the black rotary dial phones tothe yellow, beige push-button phones, which is nice, but in the lastfive years the kinds of innovative things that have occurred inhousehold and business phones ... is the most astoundingdevelopment,'' he said.   Many phones are now equipped with memory dialing to allowcallers, with the push of a button, to redial the last number calledor dial a frequently called number. A new service beginning toappear in homes lets callers know before they answer who is callingthem, he said.   ``ATandamp;T could have done all that. Bell Laboratories ... and theirWestern Electric factories were just as good then as they are now,but they didn't bring them out because nobody forced them. There wasno competition,'' he said.   In exchange for giving up its local operating companies, ATandamp;T wasfree to enter unregulated businesses that previously were offlimits, including the computer field. Its long-distance business,however, remained subject to federal regulation and still doesbecause it is considered a ``dominant'' provider able to affectcompetition in the market.   The seven regional Bell companies, which inherited ATandamp;T's localphone monopolies and became known as the Baby Bells, wereconstrained in the antitrust decree because of their control of the``local loops.'' Their local phone operations have remainedregulated, but they have been free to enter certain unregulatedlines of business.   Greene, however, has been unmoved by their pleas for morefreedom. The regional companies persuaded the Justice Department twoyears ago to recommend that the judge allow the Bell companies toprovide limited long-distance and electronic information servicesand manufacture telecommunications equipment.   Greene rejected most of the recommendations but allowed thecompanies to transmit, though not originate, information services.And until he finds evidence that the Bell companies' localmonopolies have substantially eroded, he said he sees no reason tolift the restrictions.   ``ATandamp;T was able to disadvantage and discriminate against smallercompetitors because they were in control of the local loops ... andnow the regional companies have those local loops,'' he said.   ``As long as that exists, they have the same abilities to engagein anti-competitive activities as ATandamp;T did, and they certainly havethe same incentive _ to make money _ that ATandamp;T did,'' he said.   The Baby Bells have lobbied hard in Congress and in the Reaganadministration to free them from the constraints of the decree,arguing that they have the resources to bring the information age tothe average American and Greene is standing in the way.   Their political supporters say the judge has become atelecommunications czar by keeping control of nationalcommunications policy in the courts.   Greene dismisses the criticism and says Congress has theauthority to free the Baby Bells if it wants to. He's certain,however, what the result would be if the restrictions were liftedfrom the Bell monopolies now.   ``We would be right back where we were before all this wassettled in 1984,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday Dec. 11</NOTE></DOC>
