The Investment Company Institute said assets of 585 fundsplunged $21.28 billion, to $457.76 billion, in the week endedTuesday.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Sharp drops in assets . . . in the last week or two ofthe calendar year are common, but the magnitude of lastweek's decline dwarfed the previous largest weekly decline,experienced in the pre-Christmas week of 1982,&quot; said JacobDreyer, vice president and chief economist for theWashington-based trade group.   Separately, IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report said thatassets of the 521 taxable funds it tracks plummeted $12.5billion in the week ended Tuesday, to $456.3 billion. It wasthe largest drop the Ashland, Mass., newsletter everreported.   With the stock market rising to record highs in the lastweek of 1991, some investors probably shifted cash to stockfunds from money funds, said A. Michael Lipper, president ofLipper Analytical Services Inc., which tracks mutual funds.&quot;It's an important part of the puzzle of where the money {tofuel the stock market's rise} came from,&quot; he said.   Money-fund yields are at their lowest since the Donoghue'snewsletter began tracking them in October 1975. The averageseven-day compound yield, which assumes reinvestment ofdividends, fell to 4.61% from 4.64% in the latest week,according to Money Fund Report. Martha Wittbrodt, editor,said she anticipates a bigger decline in the weeks to come asa result of the Federal Reserve's recent move to cutshort-term interest rates.   Ms. Wittbrodt said institutional investors typically takemoney out of the funds at the end of the year because ofbalancesheet considerations, and individuals make withdrawalsfor holiday purchases.   A little more than half the outflow -- $6.4 billion --came from funds open only to institutions, Donoghue's said.The Investment Company Institute said assets of 217institutional funds dropped $14.98 billion, to $144.33billion; assets of 280 general-purpose funds declined $2.89billion, to $173.81 billion; and assets of 88 broker-dealerfunds fell $3.41 billion, to $139.62 billion.   The average seven-day simple yield on taxable funds slidto 4.51% from 4.53%, Donoghue's said. The average 30-daysimple yield declined to 4.56% from 4.61% and the average30-day compound  yield eased to 4.66% from 4.72%.   Average maturity of the taxable funds' investments --which include commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),Treasury bills and bank certificates of deposit -- shortenedby two days to 59 days. Ms. Wittbrodt said managers probablywant to improve liquidity in the face of increasingwithdrawals.   Yields on tax-free funds rose, in response to increasedsupply of short-term municipal securities at the end of theyear. The average seven-day compound yield, for instance,jumped to 4.42% from 4.01%. The latest yield is equivalent toa taxable 6.14% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket and to6.41% for someone paying 31% in taxes.   Assets of 291 tax-exempt funds fell $531.1 million, to $91billion, Donoghue's said. Average maturity of the tax-freefunds' investments shortened by two days to 56 days.</TEXT></DOC>
