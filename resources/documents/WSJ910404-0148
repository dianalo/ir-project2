Even as the U.N. was acting, President Bush repeated thathe won't use U.S. forces to help Shiite or Kurdish rebelsbattling the Iraqi regime.</LP><TEXT>   But in his most blunt statement on the matter so far, Mr.Bush invited the Iraqi army to overthrow Iraqi PresidentSaddam Hussein. Facing mounting criticism that the U.S. andits allies should do more to help anti-Saddam Hussein forcesinside Iraq, Mr. Bush declared that he &quot;would be willing totake a new look&quot; at relations with Iraq if army officers take&quot;matters into their own hands.&quot;   The developments illustrate the path the administrationhopes events will take as it struggles to craft a newpost-war system in the region. The U.N. cease-fire resolutionauthorizes the rapid introduction of an internationalpeacekeeping force along the Iraq-Kuwait border. Once that isin place, the administration intends to pull U.S. forces outof southern Iraq, even if Iraq hasn't accepted all theprovisions of the cease-fire resolution.   Mr. Bush's call for an army overthrow of Saddam Hussein isanother sign that, despite its sympathies for the Kurdish andShiite insurgents fighting the Iraqi regime, theadministration's greatest hope is that moderate figureswithin the existing Iraqi leadership will arise and push outSaddam Hussein. In that way, the U.S. and its allies hope,Iraq won't be ripped apart by internal factional fighting butstill will get a new government that will change thecountry's aggressive policies.   The army appears to some U.S. analysts to be the mostlikely source of such a move against Saddam Hussein. Theprofessional Iraqi military has long had an uneasyrelationship with the Iraqi leader and his Baath party.Moreover, the army's leaders may have enhanced their statureenough to make a move now; they can argue that they are theones who have kept the nation intact by quelling the internalunrest that followed Iraq's eviction from Kuwait.   In addition, the U.N. cease-fire resolution gives Iraqiarmy leaders a new incentive to oust Saddam Hussein; itsprovisions ensure that Iraq won't have much hope of rearmingunder current circumstances.   The administration is under mounting political pressure toillustrate that it has a plan for helping Saddam Hussein'sopponents oust him. Sen. Al Gore (D., Tenn.), a potentialDemocratic presidential nominee who voted to support the waragainst Iraq, called for a more aggressive U.S. policy tohelp Kurdish and Shiite rebels. He said the U.S. shoulddeclare that it won't allow flights by Iraqi militaryhelicopters being used to battle the insurgents. He also saidthe U.S. should warn Iraq the U.S. is &quot;prepared to seek ways&quot;to help Kurdish forces if Iraq continues to pursue them.   The administration, under a presidential order signed lastfall that authorized attempts to destabilize the Iraqiregime, has been providing some &quot;low-level&quot; covert assistanceto Iraqi opposition groups, administration officials said.Under that order, the Central Intelligence Agency helped setup a clandestine radio station called the Voice of Free Iraqand helped organize meetings of disparate Iraqi oppositiongroups, officials said. But the covert program hasn'tinvolved extensive military aid.   The U.N. cease-fire resolution, passed by a 12-to-1 votewith two abstentions, doesn't directly address the politicalsituation inside Iraq. But it requires the destruction, underinternational supervision, of Baghdad's chemical andbiological weapons and its ballistic missiles with a rangegreater than about 90 miles. It also requires the removal ofmaterial that could be used in nuclear weapons.   The resolution, based largely on a U.S. text, maintains aconventional-arms embargo on Iraq and requires it to use aportion of its future oil revenues to pay for the damagecaused by its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Under the U.N.provisions, a fund would be created, using an unspecifiedpercentage of Iraqi oil revenues, to pay claims for warreparations. If Iraq refuses to accept the cease-fireresolution or cooperate in setting up the reparations system,the total U.N. embargo on purchases of Iraqi oil could beleft in place.   The resolution also sets the Iraq-Kuwait border and callson the Security Council to guarantee the frontier.   It offers Iraq a permanent cease-fire once Baghdadformally accepts the resolution's provisions. And it lays outa schedule for lifting most U.N.-imposed restrictions againstshipment of civilian goods to Iraq -- though the pace atwhich those restrictions is lifted could be adjusted as theU.N. reviews Iraqi behavior.   At the U.N., Iraq's ambassador, Abdul Amir al-Anbari,called the resolution &quot;very bad,&quot; and &quot;unfair,&quot; but didn'tsay that Iraq would refuse to comply. Since its army wasoverrun in Kuwait, Iraq has complied with most allieddemands.   &quot;They are desperate. They don't have a choice,&quot; said onediplomat. &quot;They need this for the survival of the regime.&quot;   After the cease-fire resolution was passed, the U.S.,Britain and France immediately turned to closed-doorconsultations on a new resolution demanding that Iraq stopits decimation of Kurdish and Shiite insurgents. But thatresolution isn't likely to call for any outside militarysteps. And in comments to reporters in Florida, where he isvacationing, Mr. Bush said that he won't get involved in suchmilitary steps as shooting down Iraqi military helicoptersbecause &quot;I do not want to see us get sucked into the internalcivil war inside of Iraq.&quot;   U.S. forces &quot;are not there to intervene, and that is notour purpose,&quot; Mr. Bush said. &quot;It never was our purpose. I canunderstand the frustration of some who think it should havebeen our purpose, some who never supported us in the firstplace on military action. I share their frustration, but I amnot going to commit our forces to something of this nature.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
