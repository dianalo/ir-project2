Legislators worked out the final details just before midnightafter a long evening of bargaining in the otherwise empty Capitol.;    Afterdays of bargaining with Bush administration officials, the lawmakers eased therules on the aid cut for Jordan, which would have blocked all of this year's$57.2 million slated for the kingdom.
