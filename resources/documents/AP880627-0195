The drought also will spoil some Fourth of July plans forfireworks in at least two states.   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson announced he planned to issuean executive order Tuesday banning fireworks, open fires and evensparklers because of tinder-dry conditions. He said the ban isnecessary because of the threat of accidental forest, grass andbrush fires and the potential for loss of lives.   Iowa fire officials also said they are worrying about hot embersfrom sky rockets touching off fires, and some fireworks displayshave been called off.   After more than a week of record heat from the Plains to theOhio Valley _ blamed for at least 11 deaths _ cool air washed downacross the Great Lakes and Monday morning was marked by a fewrecord lows: 44 at Jackson, Mich.; 49 at Parkersburg, W.Va.; and 45at Toledo, Ohio, the National Weather Service said.   Hot air did edge its way back onto the northern Plains on Mondaywith a record 102 at Bismarck, N.D., and a record-tying 100 atRapid City, S.D. Far to the south, Meridian, Miss., hit a record102 and Pensacola, Fla., had a record 101.   By contrast, the weather service in Seattle warned peopleplanning to be in the higher elevations of the Olympic and Cascademountains to watch for snow and freezing temperatures with thearrival of cold air from the Gulf of Alaska.   Showers and thunderstorms supplied moisture Monday morningacross the southern states from the Carolinas into New Mexico,including 2.21 inches in just three hours at Ira, Texas, theweather service said.   On Sunday, thunderstorms and showers were scattered from theSoutheast into the southern Plains with as much as 3.75 inches atDothan, Ala. Some of those storms had damaging wind, lightning andhail, and five people were killed.   In Oklahoma, ``the rainfall has been enough to ease the drought,but it's not broken,'' said weather service meteorologist GarySzatkowski. Eastern sections normally have 20 to 25 inches of rainby this time of year ``but some haven't gotten 10 inches yet.''   Leakey, Texas, west of San Antonio, got that 10 inches in fourdays over the weekend ``but if we don't continue to have moreduring the rest of the summer, we will be looking at a very badfall,'' said Betty Sansom, who lives on a ranch north of Leakey.   Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus made a whirlwind helicopter tour ofdrought-stricken timber and agricultural operations Monday and saidthe damage was ``more devastating than I thought it would be.'' Hesaid the Mississippi River ``looks like a stream flowing throughthe desert.   The scientist who popularized the ``greenhouse effect'' theorybelieves the drought is not a symptom of the gradual warming of theatmosphere he predicted as a result of air pollution, even thoughhe ``would love to be able to say, `I told you so.'''   Stephen Schneider, who heads the climate systems unit of theNational Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., saidSunday he believes the drought more likely has been caused by thejet stream swinging well north of its usual track.   This year, ``The jet stream jumped north to Canada, deprivingthe middle of the country of rain, leaving hot weather in the Southand lowering watersheds further.''   On the Mississippi River, 20 feet below normal at some pointsbecause of the drought, barge traffic moved again Monday after theArmy Corps of Engineers dredged out channels near St. Louis, Mo.,and Memphis, Tenn.   ``There are problems on the river, but they are manageable.We'll keep it open,'' said Robert Page, assistant secretary of theArmy for civil works.   Three tows of barges ran aground Monday in the Memphis area,stopping small groups of tows which will have to wait for theroadblock to be removed, said Coast Guard Lt. Richard Muth. Suchgroundings can occur even in good conditions in the ever-shiftingriver.   The Corps of Engineers said Monday it will keep traffic movingon the Ohio River for the next 60 to 80 days, even if there is norain, thanks to its system of locks and dams and water releasedfrom flood control reservoirs, though barges will have to carrylighter loads,   ``It's like the reverse of flood control,'' said Col. Richard.W. Anderchat, deputy commander of the Corps. ``If it weren't forthe dams, there wouldn't be a single barge moving between Cairo,Ill., and Pittsburgh.''   On the dry northern Plains, fire lines were completed Mondayaround a fire along the Montana-South Dakota border which grew by20,000 acres Sunday to a total of 57,000 when it was hit by wind upto 45 mph.   ``We're just seeing what happens right now,'' fire informationofficer Jack Kendley said Monday evening as firefighters appearedto gain the upper hand. ``We're strengthening the fire line, andthen the long process of mopping this thing up will begin.''   However, fire officials shied from describing the blaze as``contained.''   Smaller fires were fought in dry areas of Wyoming, Idaho andsouthern California.   Heat-related deaths last week included eight in Missouri, andone each in Georgia, Illinois and Indiana.   In the Atlanta area, water officials said the drought provoked acertain ingenuity among homeowners who are breaking the law byusing hidden sprinklers and inconspicuous hoses to water theirlawns illegally.   ``People have got every kind of trick,'' said Terry Hicks,deputy manager of the Clayton County Water Authority.   A Henry County woman who hid her sprinkler behind a bush wasturned in by a neighbor. And many residents are using ``soakerhoses'' _ flat garden hoses with small holes which can be laidupside down to allow discreet, illegal watering.</TEXT></DOC>
