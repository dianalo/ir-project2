The deposition was made byfirst sequentially evaporating Y/Ba/Cu layers followed by a heat treatmentin an environment containing oxygen. The treated films were polycrystalline,and the electrical results showed an onset temperature of about 100 Kand a zero-resistance temperature of 78 K for the films treated at 850{sup 0}C for 2 h in oxygen.</TEXT></DOC>
