The state-owned oil company, Petrobras, made its proposal afterthree hours of negotiations with strike leaders in Brasilia onSaturday.   The government offered to pay for five of nine days the workershave been on the nationwide strike on the condition they end it.   The strikers originally demanded a 354 percent pay increase, andPetrobras had offered 70 percent. There was no report of what theyhad offered in their latest proposal.   Oil workers, who earn an average of $300 a month, say they havelost buying power to inflation, now running at an annual rate of1,000 percent.   Members of the National Strike Command in Brasilia said in radiointerviews that they would review the government's proposal over theweekend. Strike leaders were expected to give their response onMonday.   Meanwhile, Brazilians scrimped and rationed to extend stocks ofcooking gas and diesel oil, which had fallen to critical levels. Therespected Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper reported Saturday thatsupplies could run out by Sunday.   In the northeast, canisters of cooking gas were being rationedone to each household. Residents of some cities waited overnight onlines that ran more than a half-mile each to buy canisters ofcooking gas.   Petrobras officials announced in radio and television broadcaststhat an emergency supply of 2,200 tons of cooking gas imported fromArgentina arrived in Porto Alegre on Saturday.   Of Brazil's 10 oil refineries, three were partially operatingSaturday.   The total production stood at 350,000 barrels a day, down from afull-capacity level of 1.5 million barrels. The country normallyconsumes about 1.1 million barrels daily.   The strike is among several in Brazil by workers angered by asputtering economy under President Jose Sareny.
