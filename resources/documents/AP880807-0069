The Dukakis campaign was quick to call what it said was Bush'sbluff: ``Once again, Vice President Bush is talking tough to thecameras but is refusing to meet Mike Dukakis in a face-to-facedebate,'' campaign manager Susan Estrich said. ``It's time to dockthe motorboat in Kennebunkport and launch the debate in Annapolis.''   Last week, Estrich and Paul Brountas, Dukakis' campaignchairman, sent a letter to Bush campaign officials criticizing thevice president for not agreeing to a series of three presidentialdebates and one vice presidential debate proposed by a bipartisanpanel. The first such debate would be Sept. 14 in Annapolis, Md.   As Bush was with his family, outgoing Treasury secretary JamesA. Baker III said the vice president will be free to speak onissues ``distinct and different from the administration'' afterhe's formally nominated.   He also said ``the chairman of the Republican party was notempowered to commit the party's nominee, and he would tell you thathe did not make any such commitment.''   Baker, resigning in time to take over as Bush's campaignchairman when the Republican National Convention nominates him inNew Orleans next week, said Bush has already started to develop his``own individual persona.''   At a Boston news conference the day before the Republicans sitdown in New Orleans to draft their platform, Democratic NationalCommittee Chairman Paul Kirk and U.S. Rep. William Gray,D-Pennsylvania, criticized past GOP practice. They accused theRepublicans of failing to live up to a host of promises they madein 1984.   A statement from the Democrats said the Reagan administrationpromised in 1984 to get tough on terrorists only to later tradearms for hostages with Iran; that after promising to hold publicofficials to the highest standards, 242 administration officialsresigned under indictment, scandal or the threat of prosecution;and that despite a commitment to health care, 37 million Americanslack health insurance and the 1984 GOP platform failed to evenmention AIDS.   In New Orleans, leaders of the Republican platform committeepredicted there will be no separate sections outlining minorityviews in the 1988 party platform, continuing a pattern establishedin the Reagan campaign years of 1980 and 1984.   Gov. Kay Orr of Nebraska, the chairwoman of the platformcommittee, said that aside from a few issues _ drug abuse, AIDS,rights of the handicapped and child care _ ``we don't see a majordeparture'' from the 1984 platform, which she described as ``a goodfoundation for us.''   The 1984 GOP platform opposed any tax increases, declined tosupport the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, and endorsed proposedconstitutional amendments requiring a balanced federal budget andgiving the president power to veto specific items in budget bills.   Baker excused Bush's underdog position in the polls as a naturalresult of his loyalty to an outgoing administration. Interviewed onNBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' he also said Bush's pledge not toraise taxes if elected is a credible position to take.   ``He will be seen in an entirely different light once he is hisparty's nominee, a bit more free to speak out, speak his own mind,and speak out on issues distinct and different from theadministration,'' Baker said.   In Kennebunkport, Bush said his standing in the polls would riseas he pressed Dukakis on the issues. ``It's not negative(campaigning),'' Bush said. ``It has to be done. And once it'sdone, the polls will take care of themselves.''   He accused Dukakis of ``flip flopping'' on a freeze on nuclearweapons, of mismanaging the budget of Massachusetts and of seekingto ``cut the muscle out of our strategic defense.''   And, said Bush, ``He goes down to New Jersey and talks about thepollution off New Jersey and look, over his shoulder is Bostonharbor, one of the most seriously polluted bodies of water in thiscountry.''   Baker, who led Bush's unsuccessful fight against Reagan for the1980 presidential nomination, said Bush already begun to make hisindividual stands known.   He cited Bush's opposition to suggestions that drug-traffickingcharges might be dropped against Panamanian leader Manuel Noriegaand his stands on AIDS, child care, energy policies and education.   On the Republican vice presidential choice, Baker declined tospeculate on who Bush will pick but said the considerations are, inorder: whether the nominee is clearly competent, is compatible withBush, will not hurt the ticket, and will help the ticket.   Bush said he has ``not really'' made any progress on choosing arunning mate.   Baker, who was Reagan's chief of staff before becoming Treasurysecretary in 1985, said Bush's pledge not to raise taxes if electedis credible because of his proposals to implement a ``flexiblefreeze'' on spending.   ``The truth of the matter is that this budget deficit has beendeclining a great deal more rapidly than people thought it would,just by virute of limitations on the increase inspending,'' hesaid. ``And that's the way that we ought to really handle thisdeficit _ stop increasing spending, don't raise taxes.''</TEXT></DOC>
