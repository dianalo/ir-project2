The peak fluence rate of thermalneutrons was 3.8 x 10/sup 6/ n/cm/sup 2/.s at the exit of the collimator.The fluence rate at the position of specimen was 1.4 x 10/sup 6/ n/cm/sup2/.s. Small amounts of neutrons penetrated the LiF ceramic shielding.Samarium specimen showed higher signal to noise ratio than gadoliniumand europium specimens. Samarium had two prominent peaks of 334 keV and439 keV. When attenuation correction was estimated using the two peaks,their peak counting ratios with and without paraffin block were 1.921and 2.086, respectively. It can be concluded that monitoring of neutronsis achieved by using the capture gamma ray from samarium with correctionof gamma ray attenuation in the brain. (Namekawa, K).</TEXT></DOC>
