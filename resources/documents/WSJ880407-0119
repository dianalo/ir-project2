The firm, which was investment adviser to California Muni Fund between 1983 and 1985, &quot;misrepresented and failed to disclose material facts with respect to the high yields on Cal Muni capital shares and the methods used to obtain that result,&quot; the SEC regional office here said.    The decision comes just weeks before the SEC is to enforce strict new guidelines relating to mutual fund advertising on yields. Currently, income funds other than money market funds are free to compute and advertise their yield performance any way they wish, as long as it doesn't violate federal securities law. As a result, funds use different performance figures and disclosure styles, making it hard for investors to make meaningful comparisons.    Starting May 1, however, an income fund will have to advertise a uniform, 30-day yield figure. Also, if an income or equity fund wants to tout performance, it also must include the fund's average annual total return for the past one-, five- and 10-year periods.    According to Charles E. Padgett, associate regional administrator for the SEC office here, Investors Portfolio's investment strategy for Cal Muni involved a scheme whereby the fund would increase yields on its portfolio by buying a high percentage of bonds that it knew couldn't be delivered by settlement date and that it couldn't necessarily pay for. Bonds that aren't delivered by their settlement date are called failed bonds.    Because Investors Portfolio could earn interest on the failed bonds, the firm reported yields on them without letting shareholders know those yields came from bonds they didn't own yet.    High yield reports would attract new investors who would provide the fund with money needed to pay for the failed bonds when they came in, Mr. Padgett said. Such activities constituted a breach of fiduciary duty to shareholders, he said, because holders didn't realize that if Cal Muni couldn't pay for the bonds, Cal Muni might be forced to liquidate part of its portfolio or exceed borrowing limitations in order to pay for them.    Cal Muni always managed to have enough cash on hand to pay for the bonds, said Barbara Brooke Manning, SEC assistant regional director. But at least three times the fund was forced to borrow more than its limit of 20% of assets to pay for the bonds that were delivered, she said.    The SEC said that investors didn't lose any money, but that they were misled in that they expected higher returns than they received.    The firm may appeal the decision to the full SEC and then to a federal appeals court. Donald Sheldon, who Mr. Padgett said owns the parent of Investors Portfolio, Donald Sheldon Group Inc., didn't return telephone calls to his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., office.    Mr. Padgett said that Lance Brofman, president of both Investors Portfolio and Cal Muni when the violations were committed, in 1986 consented to SEC findings of violations, neither admitting nor denying guilt.    Mr. Brofman was suspended from association with investment advisers for three months. He also was forbidden for two years from serving as an officer, director or trustee of a registered investment firm and for five years from serving as an officer unless supervised.    Mr. Brofman currently is chief portfolio strategist at Fundamental Portfolio Advisers Inc. here, which in January 1987 became investment adviser to Cal Muni. Mr. Brofman himself isn't adviser to Cal Muni, however.    Thomas Buckingham, president of both Fundamental Portfolio and Cal Muni, said he believed Investors Portfolio hasn't been active since 1985. The phone number listed for Investors Portfolio here was answered by Fundamental Portfolio.    Mr. Padgett said Fundamental Portfolio hasn't been the subject of any kind of SEC sanctions. But he said Mr. Buckingham was censured in October 1986 in connection with the California Tax Free Money Market, for which he was a trustee.    The SEC said it has effectively completed its inquiry into Investors Portfolio's activities.    ---   Michael Siconolfi contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
