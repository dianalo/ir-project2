said Lonn Henrichsen,chief of telecommunications in Transportation's Office of the Secretary inWashington.andM;Each separate organizaiton in the department's headquarters has budgetofficials, personnel staff and logistics officers that need to exchangeinformation among themselves and pass data back and forth to regionaloffices.andM;In some cases it means cumbersome software conversions to move documentsbetween networks such as Wang Laboratories Inc.'s WangNet and ATandamp;T Co.'sStarLAN PC networks.andM;&quot;We are in a transition phase where we have existing networks, but anythingwe buy in the future for at least three years and possibly eight years isgoing to be a StarLAN environment,&quot; said Gary Titsworth, technical office forthe departmentwide Office Automation Technology and Services (OATS) contractwith ATandamp;T.andP;  Titsworth is also branch manager for Office Automation Technologyand Services at the Federal Aviation Administration's headquarters inWashington.andM;&quot;We didn't work three years to allow the proliferation of variousmicrocomputer type to continue throughout FAA, so we have written ordersthast dictate the use of our OATS contract,&quot; Titsworth said.andM;The OATS contract is for 25-MHz 386 ATandamp;T PCs made by Intel Corp., ATandamp;T'sStarLAN hardwasre, StarGroup software and office applications that run underMicrosoft Corp.'s Windows.andM;&quot;Ultimately, if things go well,&quot; one Transportation official predicted, allTransportation offices in Washington will be on one local area network andlinked to remote offices on a single wide area network.andP;  The department'snetwork backbone will be fiber-optice cable, and interoffice data exchangewill be much easier because of departmental PC LAN standards.andM;However, the chief way Transportation interconnects its offices today isthrough a thick coax Ethernet backbone in the Nassif Building headquarters inWashington.andM;The coax backbone, installed in 1984, has helped the department tie togethermany of its office LANs and PCs.andP;  &quot;In its day it was the way to go, and itwill be the solution for the short-term,&quot; said Don Tucker, director of theOffice of Information Resources Management for the National HighwayTransportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) in Washington.andM;The EThernet backbone bridges LANs on different floors in the NassifBuilding.andP;  The Maritime Administration (MARAD) alone has 15 LANs runningunder Novell Inc.'s Advanced NetWare operating system.andM;The MARAD LANs are a distance apart on separate floors.andP;  but with 10 out ofthe 15 MARAD LANs now connected to the Ethernet backbone, a Maritime employeeon the eighth floor can log into any NetWare 2.15 LAN on the second floor, ifthe person has a password and ID to access that server.andM;&quot;If my normal server that's up here happens to be down and I'm trying to edita document using WordPerfect, I can simply log into any of the other MARADservers and complete my document there,&quot; said Ronal Butler, a contractadministrator for the Maritime Administration's Novell networks.andM;Within the NetWare 286 environment, &quot;we have great connectivity,&quot; Butlersaid.andM;Maritime employees can type the command SLIST and view a list of 35 NetWareservers.andP;  &quot;That shows you all the LANs you can physically talk to,&quot; providedyou have an ID and password to gain access, Butler said.andM;The majority of those servers belong to other Transportation organizationsthat have configured their NetWare 286 servers as bridges on an extensivebackbone cable that users call the Extended Local Area Network, or ELAN.andM;The ELAN also bridges Xerox star networks from Xerox Corp., PC networksrunning the 3+Open network operating system from 3Com Corp. of Santa Clara,Calif., and more recently Banyan networks running Vines from Banyan SystemsInc. of Westborough, Mass.andM;Office, laboratory and engineering data users all share the ELAN.andP;  &quot;We lookat it as nothing more than a big superhighway,&quot; Tucker said.andM;3Com Ethernet IB/2 or IB/2000 bridges attached with AUI drop cables to theEthernet backbone control the packet traffic between 3Com subnets.andP;  Novellservers installed on the backbone act as bridges that allow IPX traffic ontothe backbone only if it is destined for another NetWare server, said H.andO;Richard Gault, a NHTSA contractor who manages the ELAN.andM;VTerm/4010 from Coefficient Systems Corp. of New York and other PCcommunications software packages provide the setup files for non-networked PCusers to log in automatically to the ELAN through a 3Com CS/200communications server.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
