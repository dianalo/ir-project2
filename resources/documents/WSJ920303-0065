EC trade ministers were to have responded by yesterday toa compromise proposal to revive the talks on liberalizingrules in areas ranging from banking and insurance totrademarks and crossborder investments. Germany continued topressure reluctant EC members, led by France, for greaterflexibility, especially on hotly contested agriculturalreform.   But France claimed eight of the 12 EC members as allies onits rigid stance. France, a big grain exporter, said itwouldn't budge on opposing limits on exports of subsidized ECgrains.   At issue is how to cut subsidies to EC farmers that theU.S. and other agricultural exporters say distort worldtrade. The farm trade dispute has stalled progress on otherparts of the negotiations, begun 5 1/2 years ago, under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.                                                                                                          ARRESTS IN JAPAN FUTURES CASE                                                                                                          Osaka police arrested five former officials of a Japanesefutures investment firm that allegedly defrauded customers of12.6 billion yen ($97.4 million) before it collapsed lastJuly. The Itoka Co. officials were accused of bilking 2,636customers across Japan from 1981 to March 1991 by withholdingmoney intended for investment in Hong Kong sugar futures. Thearrests followed complaints by five investors who placed atotal of 56.3 million yen in the bogus fund. An additional 20Itoka employees were said to be under investigation.                                                                                                          IMF WARNS WARSAW ON EASING                                                                                                          The International Monetary Fund warned Poland against toomuch relaxation of tight budget policies, but said it wouldsupport some economic adjustments to promote growth. Ingiving qualified support to Warsaw's course correction aftertwo years of economic shock therapy, the IMF emphasized theneed to control the budget deficit. Poland, in a policy shiftlast month, called for tax relief, limited deficit spendingand a loosening of the money supply to reduce pressure onstate factories struggling in Poland's second year of deeprecession.                                                                                                          JORDAN DEBT RESCHEDULING URGED                                                                                                          The Paris Club of creditor nations has recommended arescheduling of Jordan's foreign debt resulting from loansand guaranteed credits. Repayment of official development aidloans would be made over 20 years and other credits over 15years. The Paris Club noted Jordan's efforts toward economicrecovery. The World Bank said that in 1990, Jordan's foreigndebt totaled $7.7 billion.                                                                                                          BRITAIN URGES `GREEN' EXAMPLE                                                                                                          Britain's environment secretary said rich countries mustset an environmental example to the rest of the world andurged them to lower carbon dioxide emissions. MichaelHeseltine's remarks, prepared for United Nations environmentregulators, came days after the U.S. showed reluctance totackle the carbon dioxide problem aggressively. Mr. Heseltinesaid Britain would consider stabilizing its carbon dioxideemissions at 1990 levels earlier than its target of the year2005 if other countries similarly curbed factors thatscientists say contributes to global warming and climatechanges.                                                                                                          CAUTION ON JAPAN LENDING RATE                                                                                                          A Japanese political leader vowed to tone down his remarkson monetary policy, but continued to back a discount rate cutto support the economy.   Shin Kanemaru, vice chairman of the ruling LiberalDemocratic Party and head of its largest faction, wasresponding to Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata's plea for him tohold his tongue. Mr. Kanemaru, in harsh comments by Japanesestandards, last week said the discount rate should be reducedeven if it meant firing the central bank chief.   Mr. Hata said Tokyo and the central bank were monitoringthe economy and would take measures as necessary.   The discount rate, at which the central bank lends tobanks, is 4.5% after three reductions since July 1 from 6%.Calls from government and business circles for further cutshave been intensifying as the pace of economic activity hasslowed. The central bank maintains the economy is moving tomore balanced growth.

China and Singapore signed a science and technologycooperation agreement that provides for exchanges ofscientists, and a Beijing official said he hoped it wouldlead to joint development of medicines. . . . After anothercut in public transit subsidies, Moscow's subway fare jumpedto 50 kopecks from 15, and riders reacted angrily. As itcosts one ruble to provide one ride, the city must make up ashortfall of 10 billion rubles ($90.9 million at the openmarket rate) this year.</TEXT></DOC>
