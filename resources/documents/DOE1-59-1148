Thus, foreign genes encoding antigens considered to beimportant in eliciting the immune state have been engineered into thegenome of infectious vaccinia virus and expressed, on infection in vitroand in vivo, under vaccinia virus regulation. Expression of the cDNArepresenting the RNA segment from influenza virus encoding the hemagglutinin,expression of the sequences encoding the hepatitis-B virus surface antigen,expression of the sequences from herpes simplex virus encoding the glycoproteinD, and expression of the Pasmodium knowlesi sporozoite antigen have beenreported. In all of these cases, the foreign antigens expressed undervaccinia virus regulation were biophysically, biochemically, and serologicallyindistinguishable from those synthesized under natural conditions. Again,in all of the cases tested, laboratory animals seroconverted, and significantprotection of animals immunized with the recombinant vaccinia virus wasdemonstrated in challenge experiments. Major avenues of continued researchin this area in their laboratory are directed toward further manipulationsof the vaccinia virus vectors, resulting in decreased virulence, thepreparation of vaccinia virus vectors for use in the expression of multipleforeign genes, and the enhancement of the expression levels of the foreigngenes. Progress in these areas is briefly outlined in this paper.</TEXT></DOC>
