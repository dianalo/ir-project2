The proposed changes include a reorganization of thePart and the addition of new and revised provisions. Provisions that wouldbe added or revised significantly relate to the following: <T3>Ex parte</T3> communications, motions, good faith certifications, interlocutoryreview, limited participation in a proceeding by a nonparty, prehearingexchange of information by parties, stipulations, discovery, authorityof the presiding officer during a hearing, judicial notice and admissibilityof copies and proffers, public hearings, proposed findings of fact andconclusions of law, submissions by limited participants, recommended decisionof the presiding officer, review of the recommended decision, and informalhearings for persons suspended or removed on the basis of a criminal chargeor conviction. In addition, the scope of the Part would be expanded toinclude sanctions against parties and their counsel and disciplinary rulesto govern persons ``practicing'' before the Office. These disciplinaryrules would apply to persons who represent others in matters before theagency and would include attorneys and accountants. Additional changesclarify ambiguities and revise procedures to address more appropriatelyissues and occurrences that arise in the hearing process. As a whole, theproposed revisions are intended to improve the Office's hearing processand to make its rules of practice more easily understood.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE:</T2> Comments should be received on or before July 25, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS:</T2> Comments should be sent to Docket No. 89-4, CommunicationsDivision, 5th Floor, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 490 L'EnfantPlaza East, SW., Washington, DC. 202l9.

Theproposal has two major components:(1) A reorganization of the rules, and(2) a revision of some of the current provisions and the addition of newones. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Reorganization of Part 19 </ITAG>It is proposed that Part 19 be reorganized into a format that will makeit easier to use and understand. The reorganization is needed because(i) certain new provisions are conceptually unrelated to existing subpartsand(ii) certain existing subparts can be divided into more logical groupsof provisions to form new subparts that are easier to use. The currentPart 19 is organized into eight subparts, A through H. As proposed, Part19 would be reorganized into 15 subparts, A through O. A chart has beenincluded at the end of the preamble that correlates each section of theproposed regulation with the current sections of Part 19. Each proposedsubpart is summarized below. <T3>Subpart A_General Provisions.</T3> This subpart would contain provisionswhich apply to most hearings and formal investigations. Included wouldbe a new, more detailed section covering the scope of Part 19 and an amendedsection containing definitions of terms used in Part 19. In addition, SubpartA would include amended sections relating to appearance and practice beforethe OCC, and the Comptroller's retained authority. Subpart A also wouldinclude rules governing <T3>ex parte</T3> communications with respect to formal administrativeproceedings subject to Part 19.<T3>Subpart B_Institution of Adjudicatory Proceedings; Pleadings; Motions;Interlocutory Review.</T3> This subpart would contain revised requirementsrelating to the initiation of administrative proceedings, pleadings andmotions. It also would contain revised procedures for interlocutory reviewby the Comptroller of certain rulings by the presiding officer.<T3>Subpart C</T3>_Parties and Limited Participation by Nonparties. Thissubpart would contain a new provision that addresses limited participationin a proceeding as a nonparty. The provision provides a procedure for aperson who is not a party to a proceeding to petition the presiding officeror the Comptroller to participate in a limited capacity. <T3>Subpart D</T3>_Prehearing Procedures; Prehearing Conferences; Discovery.This subpart would contain new provisions regarding prehearing exchangeof information, including discovery and stipulations. It also would containrevised provisions governing subpoenas and prehearing conferences. <T3>Subpart E</T3>_Formal Hearings. This subpart would contain certainrules and procedures to be followed in all formal hearings conducted underPart 19. It is intended to be read together with other subparts_H, I, J,and L_that contain rules and procedures relating to specific kinds of hearings.<T3>Subpart F</T3>_Post Hearing Procedures; Recommended Decision. Thissubpart would contain a new provision regarding submissions by limitedparticipants in formal hearings. It also would contain revised provisionsconcerning the effect of the presiding officer's recommended decision.That decision would become the final decision, unless a party appealedthe decision or the Comptroller initiated a review or stayed the effectivedate of the recommended decision.<T3>Subpart G</T3>_Review by the Comptroller; Final Decision. This subpartwould contain a new provision concerning review of the presiding officer'srecommended decision. Parties would have to file briefs presenting theissues to be decided by the Comptroller and the pertinent arguments regardingthose issues.<T3>Subpart H</T3>_Cease-and-Desist Proceedings. This subpart would besimilar to current Subpart B and contain provisions governing cease-and-desistproceedings. The current andSection; l9.20 regarding temporary cease-and-desistorders is deleted because such orders do not require a proceeding to beconducted pursuant to Part 19. No other substantive change in the cease-and-desistproceeding is proposed. <T3>Subpart I</T3>_Assessment of Civil Money Penalty. This subpart wouldbe the same as current Subpart C and contain provisions governing the assessmentof civil money penalties. No substantive change in the civil money penaltyproceeding is proposed. <T3>Subpart J</T3>_Removals, Suspensions and Prohibitions Generally. Thissubpart would be similar to the current Subpart D and contain provisionsgoverning general removals, suspensions and prohibitions. The current andSection;19.28 regarding suspension or prohibition by notice has been deleted becausesuch orders do not require a proceeding to be conducted pursuant to Part19. Minor amendments are made to Subpart J regarding removals and prohibitionsin the event of consent to conform the regulation to the language of 12U.S.C. 1818(e). <T3>Subpart K</T3>_Removals, Suspensions and Prohibitions Where a CrimeIs Charged or a Conviction Is Obtained. This subpart would contain similarmatter as current Subpart E which governs informal hearing procedures forremovals, suspensions and prohibitions where a crime is charged or a convictionis obtained. The procedures in Subpart E would be revised extensively toprovide more specific guidance concerning the conduct of informal hearingsauthorized by 12 U.S.C. 1818(g)(3). <T3>Subpart L</T3>_Disciplinary Proceedings Involving Federal SecuritiesLaws. This subpart would correspond to current Subpart F which containsrules and procedures for disciplinary proceedings involving municipal securitiesdealers. The provisions of Subpart L would be expanded to provide rulesand procedures for disciplinary proceedings involving government securitiesbrokers and dealers or any person associated with government securitiesbrokers or dealers, and transfer agents, for which the OCC acts as theappropriate regulatory agency under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934(``Exchange Act''). <T3>Subpart M</T3>_Exemption Hearings Under Section 12(h) of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934. This subpart would be the same as current SubpartG and contain provisions governing informal exemption hearings held pursuantto section 12(h) of the Exchange Act. Although no substantive change inthe content of this subpart is being proposed, Subpart E is clarified toprovide that informal hearings under this subpart are presumed to be public.<T3>Subpart N</T3>_Formal Investigations. This subpart would be the sameas current Subpart H which contains rules and procedures governing formalinvestigations. The regulation clarifies that andSection; 19.3(b) of SubpartA, dealing with conflicts of interest in representation, applies to formalinvestigations. <T3>Subpart O</T3>_Sanctions and Suspension and Debarment from PracticeBefore the OCC. This subpart would be new and contain sections dealingwith sanctions that may be imposed on parties and their counsel for failureto comply with the requirements of Part 19. In addition, the subpart wouldcontain sections regarding disciplinary rules governing the censure, suspensionand debarment of individuals who practice before the Office in a representationalcapacity. These sections would relate to (i) censure, (ii) suspension anddebarment, (iii) incompetence, (iv) disreputable conduct, (v) the initiationof disciplinary proceedings, and (vi) proceedings under Subpart O. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Amendments and New Provisions </ITAG>The Office last reviewed and made major revisions to Part 19 in April 1979.Since that time, the Office's experience with the application of theserules of practice and procedure has shown that, in some instances, existingPart 19 does not address adequately the issues and situations that arisein administrative proceedings. Some provisions of Part 19 need clarification.In addition, some issues are not addressed at all. The proposed revisionswould amend current rules to eliminate certain ambiguities and establishnew rules and procedures in order to improve the Office's administrativehearing process. The proposed revisions and additions to Part 19 are discussed below. Theproposals generally are discussed in the order in which they appear inthe Part. For an overview of the organization of the proposed revisionsto Part 19, refer to the chart located at the end of the preamble thatrelates sections of proposed Part 19 to those of current Part 19. A. Substantive Amendments 1. <T3>Ex parte communications (andSection;andSection; 19.1 and 19.4).</T3> ProposedandSection; 19.4 would add new provisions to govern <T3>ex parte</T3> communications to conform the OCC's rules of practiceto the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557),specifically 5 U.S.C. 557(d), which addresses <T3>ex parte</T3> communications. The proposal would prohibit <T3>ex parte</T3> communications between any person or party and the Comptroller,the presiding officer, or any decisional employee of the Comptroller relatingto the merits of an administrative proceeding (andSection; 19.4(a)). Section19.1 would be amended to define the terms ``decisional employees'' (andSection;19.1(d)) and ``<T3>ex parte</T3> communication'' (andSection; 19.1(e)).The Comptroller, the presiding officer or any decisional employee involvedin an <T3>ex parte </T3>communication would have to (i) cause the record in theproceeding to reflect the substance of the <T3>ex parte </T3>communication and any response thereto, and (ii) promptlygive notice of the <T3>ex parte </T3>communication to all parties to the proceeding (andSection;19.4(b)). A party involved in a prohibited <T3>ex parte </T3>communication would be subject to sanctions. This couldinclude exclusion from the proceeding or an adverse ruling on the issuewhich is the subject of the prohibited communication (andSection; 19.4(c)).2. <T3>Good faith certification (andSection; 19.13). </T3>Proposed andSection;19.13 would require that every written presentation made by a party afterthe issuance of a Notice must be signed by that party or his or her attorney.This signature would constitute a certification that the attorney or partyhas read the written presentation, that the presentation is well-groundedin fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for extendingor modifying existing law, and is not interposed for any improper purposeto the best of that attorney's or party's knowledge, information, and beliefformed after reasonable inquiry. Failure to sign a written presentation results in it being stricken fromthe record unless it is signed promptly after the signature omission iscalled to the attention of the attorney or party (andSection; 19.13(b)).Section 19.13(c) provides that the making of an oral motion or argumentconstitutes the same certification as the signing of a written presentation.Finally, andSection; 19.13(d) grants authority to impose sanctions authorizedin Subpart O upon the attorney, the represented party, or both for violationof the good faith certification requirements. 3. <T3>Motions (andSection; 19.14). </T3>Proposed andSection; 19.14 would containrevised provisions relating to motions. The Office is proposing these amendmentsin an effort to eliminate unwarranted delays associated with certain motionsand otherwise make the administrative hearing process function more effectively.First, this section would provide that, with respect to motions made priorto the appointment of a presiding officer, the Comptroller may rule onor delegate such motions or defer them until the appointment of a presidingofficer (andSection; 19.14(b)). In addition, a revised andSection; 19.14(c) would be added to cover motionsto dismiss. A presiding officer could deny any motion that would dismissthe proceedings or result in a final determination on the merits. The presidingofficer would have to submit any ruling that would grant a motion to dismissto the Comptroller for final determination. In addition, the section wouldprovide that in order to submit a ruling to dismiss a proceeding to theComptroller, the presiding officer must find for good cause stated withparticularity in writing that the granting of the motion is warranted.The amendment also would clarify that the Comptroller rules on motionsto dismiss in removal or prohibition proceedings (andSection; 19.14(c)(1)).Finally, andSection; 19.14(e) would prohibit dilatory motions_repetitiveor numerous motions which raise the same issues or arguments or deal withthe same subject matter. This section permits the presiding officer orthe Comptroller to assess costs attendant to processing or ruling on dilatorymotions against persons who file such motions. It also would provide thatdilatory motions may form the basis of disciplinary proceedings under SubpartO, pertaining to sanctions and suspension and debarment from appearanceor practice before the OCC. 4. <T3>Interlocutory review (andSection; 19.15). </T3>Proposed andSection; 19.15contains revised procedures under which motions for interlocutory reviewwill be considered by the presiding officer and the Comptroller. This revisionis included to correct certain problems experienced with the existing sectiondealing with interlocutory review (current andSection; 19.7(d)). While theOffice recognizes that such motions may be appropriate under certain circumstances,it is also aware of the importance of assuring that motions for interlocutoryreview are made in good faith, upon a well-founded basis, and are not usedas dilatory tactics. Therefore, the Office is proposing the amendments to establish more specificstandards and requirements governing the appeal of a presiding officer'sruling to the Comptroller. These standards and a written certificationprocess should help to improve the interlocutory review process. Interlocutoryreview, without the necessity of certification by the presiding officer,will be allowed for motions for limited participation as a nonparty pursuantto andSection; 19.21. Such review will also be allowed for motions contestingthe presiding officer's order regarding documents and sessions of a hearingthat may be made public when a motion for a public hearing has been filed(andSection; 19.42). The Comptroller, without certification and on his orher own motion or the motion of a party, may review any ruling which theComptroller believes is appropriate and in the interest of justice (andSection;19.5(f)). 5. <T3>Limited participation by nonparties (andSection; 19.21). </T3>ProposedSubpart C contains new procedures that govern when an interested person,including a national bank, may participate in a proceeding in a limitedcapacity as a nonparty. This proposed section on limited participationsets forth the factors which the applicant must provide to assist the presidingofficer in ruling on an application. If an application for limited participationis granted, the presiding officer may impose reasonable limitations onthat person's participation in a proceeding. The rule also would allowa limited participant to provide relevant materials or written or oralcomments for consideration by the presiding officer. 6. <T3>Prehearing exchange of information (andSection; 19.31). </T3>ProposedandSection; 19.31 provides for each party to a proceeding to file with thepresiding officer within a period of time established by the presidingofficer prior to the hearing date a list of witnesses, a brief descriptionof the matter about which each witness is to testify and a discussion ofthe relevance of the testimony. In addition, each party would file withthe presiding officer a list of exhibits to be offered into evidence anda brief description of the exhibits and their relevance. Section 19.31(c) sets forth limitations on any party that fails to exchangeproposed exhibits or a witness list or fails to file exhibits or a witnesslist as required by subsections (a) and (b). Finally, if any party failsto comply fully and in good faith with the requirements of andSection; 19.31,the presiding officer, on the motion of any party or on his or her ownmotion, may impose appropriate sanctions authorized in Subpart O, in additionto enforcing the specific limitations set forth in andSection; 19.31(c).The Office is proposing this change, and the changes in proposed andSection;19.32 (stipulations) and andSection; 19.33 (discovery), in an effort to promotea more orderly hearing process, including the resolution of factual andlegal issues before commencement of a formal hearing. 7. <T3>Stipulations (andSection; 19.32). </T3>Proposed andSection; 19.32 providesthat parties may stipulate to pertinent facts in a proceeding. The stipulationmay be made in writing at any stage of the proceeding or made orally uponthe record at the hearing. Stipulated facts, made in writing, would bebinding on the parties when signed. Oral stipulated facts would be bindingwhen made part of the record. 8. <T3>Discovery (andSection; 19.33). </T3>The OCC is considering the use ofdiscovery as similarly provided in the rules of some other federal agencies.Proposed andSection; 19.33 would replace the narrow provisions regardingdepositions which currently are set forth in current andSection; 19.9. Thenew provision would provide for the limited use of discovery and wouldallow the presiding officer to grant a request for discovery only upona clear showing of relevance, materiality and need.The proposed revisions include an express provision that requires a partyopposing discovery to file within 10 days a response to an applicationto make discovery (andSection; 19.33(b)(2)). Failure to file a timely responsewould be deemed a waiver of objection to discovery. The presiding officercould refuse to grant the application for discovery, in whole or in part,if the discovery would be unnecessary, unreasonable, oppressive, excessivein scope or unduly burdensome (andSection; 19.33(b)(3)). Finally, a new provision would be added to permit the presiding officer,upon the motion of a party or deponent, to terminate the discovery or limitits scope if it is shown that the discovery is being conducted in bad faithor in an unreasonable manner to annoy, embarrass, or oppress (andSection;19.33(c)). 9. <T3>Authority of the presiding officer (andSection; 19.41). </T3>ProposedandSection; 19.41 would revise provisions in current andSection; 19.10(a) relatingto the authority of the presiding officer. This provision clarifies theauthority and responsibilities of the presiding officer and includes anon-exclusive listing of the presiding officer's powers. 10. <T3>Judicial notice; admissibility of copies and proffers (andSection; 19.42).</T3>Proposed andSection; 19.42 provides that non-repetitive evidence isadmissible in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and otherapplicable laws. In addition, any evidence that would be admissible ina United States district court under the Federal Rules of Evidence is admissiblein a proceeding under Subpart E. Section 19.42(b) would allow the presiding officer to take official noticeof any material fact that might be judicially noticed by a United Statesdistrict court and any material information in the official public recordsof the OCC. Upon timely request, the parties would be afforded an opportunityto dispute any fact officially noticed or requested to be noticed underthis section. Section 19.42(c) would provide that: (1) A duplicate copy of a documentis admissible to the same extent as the original, unless there is a genuineissue as to whether the copy, in some material respect, is not a true andlegible copy of the original; (2) OCC examination reports and reports ofsupervisory activity are admissible with or without a sponsoring witness;and (3) witnesses may use illustrative or summary charts, exhibits, calendars,calculations, or outlines during their testimony which the presiding officerwould have discretion to admit into evidence. Section 19.42(d) would provide that when an objection to a question ora line of questioning is sustained, the examining attorney may make a profferon the record of what was expected to be proven by the testimony of thewitness. This could be done either by representation of counsel or by interrogationof the witness. Further, the presiding officer would be required to retainrejected exhibits, marked for identification, and transmit them with thefull record of the proceeding. 11. <T3>Public hearings (andSection; 19.43). </T3>In 1966 Congress enacted theFinancial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966 (``Act''), Pub. L. No. 89-695,to extend the enforcement authority of federal bank supervisory agenciesto address violations of banking laws and unsafe or unsound practices.The Act provides for a private hearing in any administrative proceedingunder l2 U.S.C. 1818 ``unless the appropriate Federal banking agency inits discretion, after fully considering the views of the party affordedthe hearing, determines that a public hearing is necessary to protect thepublic interest.'' 12 U.S.C. 1818(h)(1). Current andSection; 19.10(c) reiteratesthis statutory principle by providing that a hearing shall be private unless,after considering the views of the party or parties afforded a hearing,the Comptroller determines that a public hearing is necessary to protectthe public interest. As a result of its experience with administrative hearings over the pastyears, the OCC has identified a need to clarify procedures relating toa request for a public hearing and the resolution of collateral issuesassociated with holding a public hearing in an administrative proceeding.Accordingly, the Office is proposing andSection; 19.43 which sets forth proceduresgoverning the request for a public hearing, as well as procedures for determiningwhat portions of a public hearing, and documents produced at such hearing,should remain private. Under proposed andSection; 19.43(c), the Comptroller, in his or her discretion,after considering the views of the party to be afforded the hearing anddetermining that a public hearing is in the public interest, may institutea public hearing as part of, or contemporaneously with, the issuance ofa notice of charges. This provision is intended to give the Comptrolleradded flexibility to initiate public proceedings in appropriate cases.Under proposed andSection; 19.43 any party may request a public hearing byfiling a motion at least 30 days prior to the scheduled commencement ofthe formal hearing. Other parties to the proceeding will have 10 days torespond to the motion. Any party that fails to respond within the prescribedtime limits will be deemed to have no views regarding the holding of apublic hearing. The Comptroller may extend the time for parties to respondand may request additional information or arguments concerning whethera public hearing should be held. If the Comptroller grants a motion for a public hearing, the presidingofficer may determine that specific sessions of the hearing or the productionof specific documents shall be in private (andSection; 19.43(g)). The presidingofficer's determination is subject to a motion by either party for interlocutoryreview as set forth in andSection; 19.15(e). In contrast to the provisions of proposed andSection; 19.43(a), under andSection;19.43(b), special administrative proceedings brought pursuant to SubpartL_Disciplinary Proceedings Involving the Federal Securities Laws and SubpartM_Exemption Hearings Under Section 12(h) of the Securities Exchange Actof 1934, are presumed to be public. Those proceedings are brought undersections 12(h), l5B, 15C, and 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934(15 U.S.C. 78(1)(h), 78o-4, 78o-5, and 78q-1). In such cases, hearingsshall be public at their inception, and shall be initiated on a publicbasis, unless the Comptroller, in his or her discretion, and after consideringthe views of the party afforded the hearing, determines that a privatehearing is in the public interest. 12. <T3>Proposed findings and conclusions; briefs (andSection; 19.50). </T3>ProposedandSection; 19.50 would permit parties to a proceeding to file with the presidingofficer written proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Partiesalso could file briefs in support of such findings and conclusions. A party'sfailure to file any proposed finding or conclusion with the presiding officercould be deemed a waiver of the party's right to file the proposed findingor conclusion. 13. <T3>Submissions by limited participants (andSection; 19.51). </T3>ProposedandSection; 19.51 would permit any person admitted as a limited participantpursuant to andSection; 19.21 to file submissions under terms and conditionsdetermined by the presiding officer. The submissions would have to be madewithin the time allowed parties to the proceeding to file their findingsand conclusions. 14. <T3>Recommended decision of presidinq officer (andSection; 19.52). </T3>ProposedandSection; 19.52 would require the presiding officer to file a recommendeddecision containing findings of fact and conclusions of law with respectto the proceeding. That decision would become the final decision of theComptroller 30 days after service upon the parties, except under the followingtwo conditions. First, the recommended decision would not become finalas to any party that files a notice of appeal pursuant to proposed andSection;19.60 (andSection; 19.52(b)(1)). Second, the Comptroller may initiate reviewof the case or stay the effective date of the decision (andSection; 19.52(b)(2)).15. <T3>Review of presiding officer's recommended decision (andSection; 19.60).</T3>The Office is proposing certain changes in the procedure for reviewby the Comptroller of the presiding officer's recommended decision. TheOffice is proposing these new procedures in an effort to promote more efficientresolution of issues presented for review by the Comptroller, and therebyimprove the overall quality of the administrative hearing process. CurrentandSection; 19.14, which provides for automatic submission of recommendeddecisions to the Comptroller for review, would be replaced by proposedandSection; 19.60, which would require a party to seek the Comptroller'sreview of a presiding officer's recommended decision. The review process would be initiated through the filing of a notice within10 days after service of the recommended decision or other order terminatingthe proceeding (andSection; 19.60(a)). No extension of time for filing thenotice would be available. Failure to file a notice of review would bedeemed consent to the findings of fact and conclusions of law in the recommendeddecision for purposes of the Comptroller's review. The review would beperfected through the filing of a brief (andSection; 19.60(b)). The reviewbrief would contain the party's exceptions to the recommended decisionand would be served on any other party who would be allowed to file ananswering brief. Such briefs would be of a prescribed form and contentand include a statement of the issues presented for review and argumentscontaining the contentions of the party (andSection; 19.60(d)). Any matternot briefed would be deemed waived and could not be argued before the Comptroller(andSection; 19.60(d)). Proposed andSection; 19.60(e) specifies the effect of failing to file a noticeof review. Existing sections of Part 19 which would be amended addressrequests for oral arguments before the Comptroller (proposed andSection;19.61), notice of submission to the Comptroller (proposed andSection; 19.62),and decision of the Comptroller (proposed andSection; 19.63).16.<T3> Removals, suspensions, and prohibitions when a crime is charged ora conviction is obtained (Subpart K)</T3>. Proposed andSection;andSection;19.101 and 19.102 provide for a post-suspension or post-removal hearingfor a director, officer, or other person participating in the affairs ofa bank who has been charged or convicted of a crime involving dishonestyor breach of trust that is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceedingone year. These suspensions or removals are authorized when the Officebelieves that continued service or participation by the individual maypose a threat to the interests of the bank's depositors or may threatento impair public confidence in the bank (12 U.S.C. 1818(g)(1)). This subpartamends the current Subpart E which addresses this issue. A person who has been suspended or removed pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818(g)(1)may petition for an informal hearing to determine whether his or her continuedservice with, or participation in, the affairs of the bank should be allowed(andSection; 19.101). In such a hearing, 12 U.S.C. 1818(g)(3) places theburden on the suspended or removed individual to show that such continuedservice or participation does not, or is not likely to, pose a threat tothe interests of the bank's depositors or threaten to impair public confidencein the bank.Proposed andSection; 19.102 would revise extensively the current procedureset forth in Subpart E for informal hearings conducted pursuant to 12 U.S.C.1818(g)(3). The revised procedures are intended to (i) ensure that theinformal hearing process satisfies due process requirements, while at thesame time (ii) comply with the congressional intent of providing expeditiousreview of orders suspending or removing persons who have been charged withor convicted of a crime. The proposal provides that requests for hearings will be directed to theDistrict Administrator in the district in which the affected bank is locatedor to the Director, Multinational and Regional Bank Supervision, in Washington,DC if the affected bank is supervised by the Multinational Banking Department(andSection; 19.101). The District Administrator or the Director, Multinationaland Regional Bank Supervision, would select the date, time and place forthe hearing and notify the person who requested the hearing. The OCC reservesthe discretion to consider all relevant factors and determine the appropriateplace of the hearing. Unless particular circumstances require otherwise,hearings will be held in the OCC's district office in the district in whichthe affected bank is located. In the case of banks supervised by the MultinationalBanking Department, the Director, Multinational and Regional Bank Supervision,will determine if the hearing will be held in Washington or in the districtin which the affected bank is located. Proposed andSection; 19.102(b) would provide that the Comptroller or theComptroller's delegate would appoint one or more OCC employees to presideover the informal hearing. A presiding official could not be any personwho has been involved in the enforcement proceeding, a factually relatedproceeding, or in a prosecutorial or investigative role in the underlyingenforcement action. The informal hearing would not be governed by proposedSubpart E (Formal Hearings), formal rules of evidence, or the provisionsof the Administrative Procedure Act applicable to adjudicatory proceedings.A petitioner could waive an oral hearing and elect to have the presidingofficer determine the matter solely on written submissions (andSection; 19.102(c)).The presiding officer would have broad authority concerning the conductof the informal hearing, including authority to determine procedural questions,limit the number of witnesses and impose reasonable time limitations onthe proceeding (andSection; 19.102(d)(2)). Witnesses generally would notbe permitted to appear at the hearing unless the presiding officer is satisfiedthat there is a specific need for oral presentations. Witnesses, if permitted,would testify under oath (andSection; 19.102(d)(3)(ii)). A verbatim transcriptof the proceeding would be taken only if (i) the presiding officer determinesthat the nature of the case warrants a transcript, or (ii) the petitionerrequests it and agrees to pay all expenses (andSection; 19.102(d)(4)). Proposed andSection; 19.103 would require the presiding officer to make arecommended decision to the Comptroller and serve copies on the parties,who would be allowed to submit comments on the presiding officer's decision.The Comptroller would make a final decision and notify the petitioner ofhis or her decision within 60 days following the hearing. The Comptroller'sdecision would include a statement of the reasons for continuing, terminatingor modifying the order of suspension or removal (andSection; 19.103(b)).The decision of the Comptroller would constitute a final and unappealableorder. See 12 U.S.C. 1818(h)(2). A removal or suspension would remain ineffect until terminated by the Comptroller (andSection; 19.103(d)). A suspendedor removed individual could petition the Comptroller to reconsider theorder of removal or suspension after 12 months (andSection; 19.103(e)). 17. <T3>Disciplinary proceedings involving the federal securities laws andsecurities offering and sale requirements (andSection;andSection; 19.110-19.112)</T3>.Proposed Subpart L expands the list of persons against whom the OCC maybring disciplinary proceedings. Under current andSection;andSection; 19.34-19.36,the OCC may take disciplinary action against a bank which is a municipalsecurities dealer, or any person associated or seeking to become associatedwith that municipal securities dealer. Under proposed Subpart L, the OCCalso may take disciplinary action against a bank which is a governmentsecurities broker or dealer, any person associated with a government securitiesbroker or dealer, or a bank which is a transfer agent. Subpart L is furtherclarified to provide the Comptroller with authority to issue and serveany notices and temporary or permanent cease-and-desist orders, and takeany actions authorized by section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act(12 U.S.C. 1818) and other subparts of this Part against all of the partieslisted above, including clearing agencies. These revisions simply implementin Part 19 authority currently vested in the Comptroller under the federalsecurities laws, or added by the Government Securities Act of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-571 (section 15C of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-5). 18. <T3>Formal investigations (Subpart N)</T3>. Proposed Subpart N would beamended to clarify that andSection; 19.3(b) of Subpart A, dealing with conflictsof interest in representation, applies to the formal investigation process.19. <T3>Parties and representational practice before the OCC: standards ofconduct (Subpart O)</T3>. The proposed Subpart O would contain rules governingsanctions imposed on parties and their counsel for failure to comply withthe requirements of Part 19. In addition, the subpart would establish rulesto govern the disciplining of individuals who practice before the OCC.The subpart would not apply to OCC employees. The OCC is proposing thenew subpart in an effort to ensure that attorneys, accountants, and otherindividuals who practice before the OCC meet appropriate standards of conduct.This is consistent with the OCC's responsibility to the national bankingsystem and the public to promote safe and sound banking practices. Under proposed andSection; 19.141(a), sanctions may be imposed when any partyor representative has acted in a manner contrary to any applicable statute,regulation or order, has engaged in contemptuous conduct or has materiallyinjured or prejudiced some other party. This section is included to clarifythat the presiding officer has authority to effectively deal with the problemof parties and their representatives who fail to comply with statutoryrequirements, Part 19 or an applicable order. Sanctions imposed in accordance with andSection; 19.141(b) may include oneor more of the following: (1) Issuing an order against the party; (2) strikingany testimony, rejecting any documentary evidence offered, or strikingpapers filed by the party; (3) precluding the party from contesting specificissues; (4) precluding the party from challenging certain evidence offeredby another party; (5) refusing a late filing or conditioning acceptanceof a late filing on any terms that are just; and (6) assessing reasonableexpenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by the other party as a resultof the offending party's improper action or inaction.Sanctions could be imposed by the presiding officer upon the motion ofany party or upon the presiding officer's own motion. However, any sanctionthat enters a final order determining the case on the merits must be submittedto the Comptroller for final ruling. No sanction, other than refusal to accept late filings, shall be imposedwithout notice and opportunity to be heard in a manner deemed appropriateby the presiding officer. Parties' requests for sanctions or the presiding officer's imposition ofsanctions would be subject to interlocutory review in the same manner asother rulings of the presiding officer (andSection; 19.141(c)(3)). The rulemakes it clear that the imposition of sanctions pursuant to andSection; 19.141would not preclude the presiding officer or Comptroller from taking anyother action authorized by law. Proposed andSection;andSection; 19.142 through 19.151, the censure, suspensionand debarment provisions, would apply to individuals who practice beforethe OCC. Proposed andSection; 19.142 sets forth the Comptroller's authorityto censure, debar or suspend an individual. The rule authorizes the Comptrollerto censure, suspend or debar any individual who, after due notice and opportunityfor hearing, is found to be incompetent, disreputable, or who refuses tocomply with the rules and regulations of Subpart O, or who with intentto defraud, knowingly or willfully deceives, misleads or threatens anyclient, prospective client, or other person. ``Practice'' is defined as any action connected with presentations to theOCC or any of its officers or employees relating to a client's rights,privileges or liabilities under laws or regulations administered by theOCC. This would include, but not be limited to: (i) The preparation of any statement, opinion or other paper by an individualwhich is filed with or submitted to the OCC on behalf of a person in connectionwith any application, notification, report or document, (ii) the representationof a person at conferences, hearings and meetings, or (iii) the transactionof other business before the OCC on behalf of a person (andSection; 19.143(a)(1)).The term ``practice'' is not intended to apply to any work prepared byan individual for a bank at its request in the ordinary course of business.Thus, for example, an annual audit prepared by a certified public accountantfor a bank and used solely by the bank in the ordinary course of businesswould not be considered practice before the OCC. However, if the CPA preparedthe audit pursuant to the OCC's request to the bank, for subsequent submissionto the OCC, the CPA could be considered practicing before the OCC. (andSection;29.43(a)(2)). Proposed andSection; 19.145 defines ``incompetence'' as conduct which reflectsa lack of knowledge, judgment or skill that a professional would ordinarilyand reasonably be expected to exercise under particular circumstances inrepresenting the rights and interests of a client. This would include:(i) Representing a person in a matter which the professional knows or shouldknow he or she is incompetent to handle Without associating with a personwho is competent to handle the matter; (ii) handling any matter withoutadequate preparation; or (iii) neglect of a matter entrusted to him orher. Proposed andSection; 19.146 sets forth the bases for suspension and debarmentfor disreputable conduct. This includes, but is not limited to: (i) Thewillful violation or aiding and abetting the violation of federal bankinglaws, rules or regulations, (ii) conviction of any offense involving dishonestyor breach of trust, or (iii) knowingly giving false or misleading informationor participating in giving false information to the OCC or any of its employeesor any tribunal authorized to pass upon matters administered by the OCCin connection with any matter pending or likely to be pending before it.``Information'' includes facts or other statements contained in testimony,financial statements, applications for enrollment, affidavits, declarationsor any other documents or written or oral statement. Disreputable conduct also includes: (i) Directly or indirectly attemptingto influence the official action of any OCC officer or employee by useof threats, false accusations, duress or coercion by the offer of specialinducement or promise of bestowing any gift, favor or thing of value; (ii)disbarment or suspension from practice by any authority of a state, possession,commonwealth or the District of Columbia for conviction of a felony ormisdemeanor involving moral turpitude in matters involving the regulatoryresponsibility of the OCC; and (iii) knowingly aiding another individualto practice before the OCC during the other individual's period of suspension,disbarment or ineligibility. Finally, disreputable conduct also would include (i) contemptuous conductin connection with practice before the OCC, knowingly making false accusationsand statements, or circulating or publishing malicious or libelous matterand (ii) willful violation of any regulations governing Subpart O. Under proposed andSection; 19.147, disciplinary proceedings are initiatedby the report to the OCC by any person, including any OCC employee, ofconduct by an individual practicing before the OCC in a representativecapacity that would serve as a basis for censure, suspension or debarment.If the Comptroller believes that such individual has engaged in conductthat would serve as a basis for censure, suspension or debarment, the Comptrolleror the Comptroller's delegate may, after considering the views of the individual,censure such individual or commence a formal disciplinary proceeding. Theproceeding is initiated by issuance of a complaint. Except in cases ofwillfulness, or when time, the nature of the proceeding, or the publicinterest do not permit, the Comptroller will apprise the individual againstwhom the proposed action is brought of the conduct that is the basis ofthe proceeding. That individual will be given the opportunity to complywith all lawful requirements or take whatever action may be necessary toremedy the conduct that is the basis for the initiation of the proceeding.Proposed andSection; 19.148 provides that regardless of whether a debarmentor suspension hearing has been commenced, the Comptroller may initiatea conference with the individual against whom censure, suspension or debarmentis being considered, for the purpose of avoiding the institution of, ordecision in, a formal debarment or suspension proceeding. If the conferenceresults in a stipulation in connection with a proceeding involving theindividual, the stipulation may be entered on the record. Proposed andSection; 19.149 relates to hearings under the new Subpart O.As proposed, hearings permitted or required under Subpart O would be conductedbefore an administrative law judge, using the procedures in Part 19 foradjudicatory proceedings. The Comptroller or the Comptroller's delegateshall appoint a person to represent the OCC in the hearing. Any personhaving prior involvement in the matter which is the basis for the hearingwould be disqualified from representing the OCC in the hearing. The hearingwould be closed to the public, unless otherwise directed by the Comptroller.The presiding officer would issue a recommended decision to the Comptrollerwho would make the final decision. The Comptroller would, however, havethe discretion to choose disciplinary action other than suspension or debarment,such as a written letter of censure. Proposed andSection; 19.150 explains the effect of a final order of debarmentor suspension. If an individual person is debarred, he or she may not practicebefore the OCC unless permitted to do so by the Comptroller. If an individualis suspended, he or she would not be permitted to practice before the OCCduring the period of suspension. The provision also states that the Comptrollermay give notice of the suspension or debarment to appropriate officersand employees of the OCC, interested departments and agencies of the FederalGovernment, and appropriate state authorities in the state in which thedebarred or suspended individual is or was licensed.Proposed andSection; 19.151 provides that the Comptroller will entertaina petition for reinstatement after the end of one year following debarmentor at such other time designated in the order of debarment. The Comptrollerwill grant reinstatement only if the Comptroller is satisfied that thepetitioner's conduct would be in accordance with Part 19 and that grantingreinstatement would not be contrary to the public interest. B. Technical Amendments This proposed rule includes various amendments to correct minor proceduraldeficiencies that currently exist in the OCC's administrative process.To correct these problems, which can impede the efficient operation andconsistency of the administrative process, the OCC is amending provisionsdealing with the filing of documents with the Hearing Clerk (andSection;19.11), stipulations for extensions of time (andSection; 19.5), and motions(andSection; 19.13). In addition, various sections of 12 CFR Part 5 must be amended to reflectthe changes made to l2 CFR Part 19. Specifically, andSection; 5.50(g), whichimplements provisions of the Change in Bank Control Act, must be revised.These technical revisions will be made when the final rule is published.The revised Part 19 shall be applicable to any proceeding that is commencedby the issuance of a notice after the effective date of the final rule.Part 19, as it currently exists, shall apply to any proceeding commencedprior to the effective date of the final rule unless, with the consentof the presiding officer, the parties agree to have the proceeding governedby revised Part 19. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Comments Requested </ITAG>The OCC requests comments on all provisions of the proposed revision ofPart 19. In addition, to evaluate the effectiveness of significant proposedamendments and new provisions, the OCC specifically requests comments oncertain major issues relating to: (1) Procedures and criteria establishedfor interlocutory review (andSection; 19.15); (2) limited participation bynonparties (andSection; 19.21); (3) the amended discovery provisions (andSection;19.33); (4) public hearings in administrative proceedings (andSection; 19.43);(5) procedures provided for removals and suspensions where a crime is chargedor a conviction is obtained (Subpart K_andSection;andSection; 19.100-19.103);and (6) sanctions and suspension and debarment of persons from practicingbefore the OCC (Subpart O_andSection;andSection; 19.140-19.151). <ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
