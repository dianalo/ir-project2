Maybe inPittsburgh they think that because the mayor is also a Jewishgrandmother she can subsist on her own chicken soup.   Not in New York, where a food trend is big news and Mayor EdwardI. Koch's appetite _ and battle of the waistline _ are well-known.   In New York, the mayor gets a chef. And the chef can cause hisown scandal.   Because of an indiscretion in an administration that has seensome major corruption, Koch is looking for a new cook to shareGracie Mansion, the sprawling river-view estate the city provideshim on the ritzy Upper East Side.   In what could be known as the Cheesecake Caper or Garlicgate,chef Michael London resigned when investigators determined he hadimproperly used city workers and facilities in his private cateringand baking business.   While authorities decided not to prosecute, Koch ordered thecook _ known for his salmon with garlic, his chocolate chip cookiesand his cheesecakes _ to quit or drop his outside work.   London elected to leave the mayor's employ, giving Koch's staffa task few other U.S. mayors ever have to deal with _ finding a newlive-in chef.   Few other cities even provide their mayors with a home, nevermind a cook to live in it. That leaves most of them with acoffeemaker in the office and maybe a takeout menu in a desk drawer.   ``We do things a little differently here in the West,'' saidBonnie Bartak, spokeswoman for Mayor Terry Goddard of Phoenix,Ariz., who is a bachelor like Koch but cooks for himself and livesin a bungalow he owns.   ``Even our governor (Rose Mofford) is probably home fixingherself a bologna sandwich like the rest of us,'' Ms. Bartak said.   Los Angeles furnishes Mayor Tom Bradley with a place to live,but on the rare occasion he dines there, Bradley and his wife mustfend for themselves, said Deputy Mayor Mike Gage.   Nevertheless, he didn't want to help New York find a chef forKoch.   ``L.A. has some wonderful chefs, but we're not inclined toexport them. We enjoy them here,'' Gage said.   Up the coast, San Francisco's Mayor Art Agnos has to provide hisown house _ and is struggling to make the payments _ said spokesmanScott Shafer. Does he get a chef, at least?   ``His wife wishes he did,'' said Shafer.   Doesn't cook for himself, eh?   ``I've never seen him near a stove.''   It gets worse in small towns, apparently. Mayor Paul Warwick inthe small coastal Georgia town of Brunswick said he gets thefollowing:   ``No chef, no house, no car.''   He does, however, get a gasoline expense account in addition tohis $125-a-week salary.   Koch's salary is exactly 20 times higher at $130,000 a year.   Some mayors seem to manage quite well without a chef, practicingthe culinary arts themselves.   Detroit Mayor Coleman Young is ``a connoisseur of chili,'' saidspokesman Bob Berg. ``He's also got a sausage and sauerkraut dishthat he puts together.''   And in Pittsburgh, Mayor Sophie Masloff, a Jewish grandmother,is known to make a good pot of chicken soup and a great batch ofcookies.   But in New York, the tradition of hiring someone to cook for themayor seems well entrenched.   Officials at City Hall and the city archives couldn't say whichmayor was the first to have a city-provided chef, but all agreedthat several men who served before Koch assumed office in 1978enjoyed the perquisite.   Koch spokesman Lee Jones said the chef's position, which pays$51,000 a year, saves the city money because of the banquets Kochholds and the entertaining he does as chief executive of thenation's largest city.   Besides, they say the cheesecake is really tasty.</TEXT></DOC>
