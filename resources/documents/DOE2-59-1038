However, technologiesof preventing silica scaling from the geothermal hot water has not yetbeen put to practical use except a part of them. This article reportsa scaling prevention method by the ultrafiltration film separation method.In the above method, after turning supersaturated silica in the hot waterinto silica colloid, the film separation is conducted. The recoveredsilica does not contain arsenic, etc., requires no secondary treatmentof sludge and furthermore, can be utilized effectively. The field testwith a pilot plant (5t/h) was conducted at Ohdake Power Station and thepossibility of the long-term continuous operation was confirmed. In addition,the manufacture of zeolite, which was used as catalytic material, wasable to use the recovered silica. Although it was confirmed that theeffect of preventing scaling by the treated hot water was extremely good,there still remain such subjects for study as prolongation of film durability,etc..
