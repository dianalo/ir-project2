In a political turnabout, Republican Govs. Kay Orr of Nebraskaand Mike Hayden of Kansas, both first-termers, have been cast bytheir Democratic rivals as big spenders, responsible for raisingincome or property taxes.   And in Illinois, Democrat Neil Hartigan has appointed himselfthe penny-pinching conservative, while branding GOP opponent JimEdgar the tax-promoting liberal.   ``In this year, the candidate who grabs the tax issue first getsthe benefit out of it,'' said Jim Nowlan, a public policy professorat Knox College in Galesburg, Ill.   ``People are responding to the anti-tax rhetoric because of thisconcern that spending more won't change anything,'' he added.``There's a very sour mood toward government and politicians on thepart of the public.''   The impact of such sentiments will be realized Tuesday as nineMidwest governors - seven incumbents are seeking re-election - arechosen and eight U.S. senators bid for new terms.   The Kansas gubernatorial and Illinois Senate challengers hope tomake the record books as the first women in those jobs. Iowa'sSenate race already is historic - the $11-million campaign is themost expensive ever.   Though hot-button issues such as abortion have been debated, thedominance of the anti-tax mood reflects wider economic concerns ina region still vulnerable, despite its recovery from the '80s farmcrisis and manufacturing decline.   In September, for example, Michigan and Illinois posted 7.2percent jobless rates, highest among 11 major states. And risingoil prices and the Persian Gulf crisis have escalated talk ofrecession.   ``The Midwest is particularly sensitive to dislocation in theeconomy,'' said David Axelrod, a Chicago-based politicalconsultant.   ``We were the first ones in the recession in the early '80s andthe last ones out. When there's economic turmoil, it tends to favorchallengers,'' he added, citing the GOP in Ohio and Democrats inIllinois.   In those states, two governors who've had presidentialhankerings leave office: Illinois' Republican James Thompsonretires after a record 14 years; Ohio's Richard Celeste, aDemocrat, is legally barred from a third consecutive term.   Nationally, the GOP regards Ohio as one of its bestopportunities to grab a Democratic gubernatorial seat. StateAttorney General Anthony Celebrezze Jr. has emphasized populistthemes; Republican George Voinovich, a former Cleveland mayor,claims credit for his city's fiscal revival.   In Illinois, taxes have seized the spotlight. Edgar, secretaryof state, favors making permanent a two-year, 20 percent income taxincrease. Hartigan, state attorney general, opposes it.   In Kansas, Democratic State Treasurer Joan Finney blames Haydenfor high property taxes resulting from statewide reappraisal andimplementation of a classification system completed in 1989.   Hayden counters by claiming Mrs. Finney doesn't know anythingabout state government.   The race is a Hobson's choice with both registering ``mammothnegatives'' in polls, said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansaspolitical science professor.   ``You've got a governor presiding over a huge property taxincrease, who's not especially popular,'' he said. ``You've gotthis woman who's not perceived as especially competent, maybe evendangerous, in not being up to the job.''   Abortion also is an issue. Mrs. Finney opposes it, Hayden ispro-choice.   In Nebraska, Mrs. Orr, the state's first woman governor, hasbeen criticized by opponent Democrat Ben Nelson, an attorney, forher 1987 endorsement of an overhaul of the state's income taxsystem.   She initially denied it caused increases, but now says stepshave been taken to remedy the situation.   In Minnesota, Gov. Rudy Perpich, once considered vulnerable, hasbeen on the sidelines watching the tumult in the GOP Party createdby the 11th-hour withdrawal of challenger Jon Grunseth, who wasaccused of marital infidelity and swimming nude with teen-agegirls.   State auditor Arne Carlson, who had launched a 11th-hourwrite-in campaign, replaced Grunseth on the ballot.   Minnesota GOP Sen. Rudy Boschwitz says the Republican turmoilhas overlapped into his race against college professor PaulWellstone, who has surged dramatically in the polls in recentweeks.   In Iowa, two Capitol Hill pros are clashing in the Senate race:Rep. Tom Tauke vs. incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin.   Tauke calls Harkin a big spender; the senator says his opponentvotes against programs that would help Iowa.   Tauke opposes abortion, Harkin is pro-choice.   In Illinois, a Republican House member also hopes to knock offan incumbent. However, Lynn Martin, initially considered one of theGOP's brightest prospects, has failed to dent Sen. Paul Simon'spopularity.   In three gubernatorial contests, state lawmakers arechallengers:   -Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad faces Democrat Don Avenson, stateHouse speaker.   -Michigan Gov. James Blanchard is opposed by GOP state SenateMajority Leader John Engler.   -Wisconsin Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson is challenged byAssembly Speaker Tom Loftus.   And in the Senate:   -South Dakota Republican Sen. Larry Pressler faces businessmanTed Muenster.   -Indiana's Dan Coats, who inherited Vice President Dan Quayle'sseat, is running against Democratic state Rep. Baron Hill.   ---   EDITOR'S NOTE - Sharon Cohen is the AP's Midwest RegionalReporter, based in Chicago.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Nov 4</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
