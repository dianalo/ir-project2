Signs of reduced domestic supplies helped fuel the advance by crude and gasoline contracts -- the sixth consecutive jump in oil prices and the ninth in the past 10 sessions. The last time prices were higher was in January 1986.    The rally was triggered by reports that Iraqi warplanes bombed an offshore Iranian oil installation, signaling an escalation of tensions in the Persian Gulf, analysts and traders said. And fresh Iranian threats to sink U.S.-flagged ships renewed concerns about the U.S. decision to reflag Kuwaiti tankers in the region, traders said.    &quot;It was the second Fourth of July down here,&quot; said a trader of the frenzied action in the oil pits at the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price explosion, said Rick Donovan, head of the international energy department at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. in New York, &quot;is due more to geopolitical factors rather than supply and demand.&quot;    Crude oil for August delivery on the New York Merc soared 57 cents a barrel to $22.15. The estimated volume of 105,801 crude futures contracts neared a record, and the estimated crude oil options turnover of 27,035 surpassed the previous record of 25,343, set June 26. August gasoline rose 1.06 cents a gallon to 56.53. Heating oil also rose.    Spot, or non-contract, prices surged as well. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose 55 cents a barrel to $22.15. And the August price of North Sea Brent, a widely traded European crude, rose 35 cents a barrel to $20.20 in late trading.    A weekly inventory report released by an industry group after the market closed Tuesday spurred some of yesterday's gains, traders said. The American Petroleum Institute's statistics showed declines in weekly U.S. gasoline and crude stockpiles, as well as a sharp drop in the refinery utilization rate.    The inventory figures also showed that gasoline demand rose 3% for the month compared with a year earlier. And the 12-week average gas demand of 7,610,000 barrels a day &quot;is approaching the highest demand of the decade,&quot; said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.    Late-afternoon profit taking pared some of the day's strong gains, however, and some analysts suggested that the rally could be stunted if Middle East tensions ease.    That isn't likely, though, some say. The mounting friction in the Persian Gulf, particularly with the coming U.S. reflagging, &quot;is entrenched in traders' psyche,&quot; said Stephen Turner, an oil analyst at Wood MacKenzie andamp; Co., an Edinburgh, Scotland, brokerage firm.    Reports of new Iranian threats added to some analysts' bullishness. Yesterday, for instance, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's parliament, said Iran is prepared for a showdown with the U.S. in the Persian Gulf.    Iran &quot;is ready to sink American ships,&quot; he said yesterday, according to news service reports.    &quot;That threat was so bold and blatant that it's making the market extremely nervous,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York.    Meanwhile, the recent price gains have led several major oil companies to raise the price they pay for West Texas Intermediate 50 cents a barrel to $20.    In other futures markets yesterday:    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: The report of a wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit in May sent futures prices soaring as many traders scurried to cover their short positions by buying back contracts. Meanwhile, the strength in foreign currencies and the weakness in the dollar, together with a rise in oil and precious metal prices, sent interest rate futures prices tumbling. While the $14.4 billion trade figure surprised economists who, on average, were expecting a deficit of $13.6 billion, it was an even bigger surprise to those who believed Tuesday's rumors that the trade deficit had narrowed to as little as $11 billion in May. The actual figure &quot;was just frightening for those who had been short the currencies or long the dollar,&quot; said Dennis Gartman of Gartman Financial Services Inc. in Portsmouth, Va. And he predicted foreign currency futures prices will continue to rise for a week or so. &quot;It's very rare not to follow through&quot; on a rally as strong as yesterday's, he said.    PRECIOUS METALS: Concern that inflation may be accelerating triggered demand for precious metals. August gold on the Commodity Exchange in New York delivery rose $5.80 to $455.30 an ounce, and September silver was up 18.5 cents an ounce to $7.865. October platinum at the New York Merc rose $13.20 an ounce to $580.80. According to Michael Snow, senior vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland's New York branch, buying tied to expectations that inflation will pick up arose as the dollar dived following the report of a wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit in May, and as oil prices boomed because of a bullish U.S. production and supply report as well as Persian Gulf tensions.The wider trade gap caught traders by surprise because it narrowed the previous two months, analysts said.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork belly and hog futures prices rallied as pork product prices steadied and the number of animals going to slaughter fell. July pork bellies soared the daily limit as the supply of fresh bellies, or uncured slabs of bacon, shrank, said Gerald Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. The July hog contract also gained as traders tried to align the hog futures price with higher cash market prices. Cattle prices finished mixed. Large open interest in futures contracts, which has traders liquidating positions, continues to weigh against the market. The August contract was up slightly as traders tried to align it with higher cash prices.    COTTON: Futures prices rose as reports of hail in Texas cotton-growing areas stimulated buying. The Texas crop was &quot;already delayed and damaged by adverse weather,&quot; said Judy Weissman, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. &quot;This is a demand-driven market,&quot; she said, with many cotton mills that usually close around this time of year staying open at least part-time. Miss Weissman also cited expected reductions in acreage for the 1987-88 U.S. crop. </TEXT></DOC>
