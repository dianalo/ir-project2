Princeton's All-American basketball star, remember, broke in with the New York Knickerbockers in the 1967-68 season, signing a then-record $500,000-plus four-year contract, and discharging his military obligation by serving in the Air Force Reserve.    Watching vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle, it occurs to us that Senator Bradley, ever sensible, was insistent on not running for President this year because he didn't want to become the first politician of his generation to face the inquisition. As it happens, Senator Bradley missed part of his first basketball season while serving his six-month Air Force active duty tour, and eventually rose to First Lieutenant. Yet we can imagine the questions: Did anyone from the Knicks ever talk to anyone at the Air Force about assignments? How did you feel about soldiers dying in Vietnam when you were being paid a half million to play games?    Now, we hasten to add that Bill Bradley remains our favorite candidate to lead the Democratic Party out of its isolationist, spend-and-tax wilderness. We would infinitely prefer him as President to such Vietnam veterans as Senator John Kerry (D., Mass.) or Senator Larry Pressler (R., S.D.). But the example certainly helps put Senator Quayle's difficulties in perspective. We agree with Congressman Henry Hyde that we'd admire Dan Quayle more if he were an Ollie North with a chest full of medals, but the nation is going to be the poorer if service in the Guard or Reserve disqualifies as President anyone of draft age during Vietnam.    Now, we have to admit that we share with Republican cynics the suspicion that the itinerant press corps would not be nearly so persistent with these questions if the reservist in question were Senator Bradley rather than Senator Quayle. It is a curious paradox: We know of no individual in the mainstream press who is not professionally capable of rising above personal opinions. Yet when the pack runs, a sort of mob psychology takes over and double standards ooze.    We watched, for example, when a press conference took John Zaccaro's financial disclosures at face value, even booing one of our editorial writers who didn't. We recall that before Michael Dukakis put his physician up for questioning, &quot;the press&quot; defined as the story to pursue: not, why doesn't he make fuller disclosure; but, who's spreading this rumor? Who, incidentally, spread what we now know to be unfounded rumors that Ed Meese did something corrupt about Wedtech?    Not that this is necessarily a partisan issue. It was Jimmy Carter who observed in Playboy in 1976, &quot;There's nobody in the back of this plane who would ask an issue question unless he thought he could trick me into some crazy statement.&quot; And party affiliations aside, the typical televised press conference -- at the best, let alone in the present inflamed circumstances -- has an eerie resemblance to a bearbaiting.    At more than a risk of enraging our colleagues, we thought it a stroke of brilliance that the Bush campaign wizards had Mr. Quayle deal with the press in front of a home-town crowd. So that's how you cope with Sam Donaldson and all the little Sam Donaldsons; bring a claque of your own. Of course, the Medicis would have understood immediately. And the American people have their own way of sorting it out; in a Newsweek poll of 1,000 voters Thursday and Friday, 74% didn't care about Mr. Quayle's National Guard service, and Vice Presidnet Bush led Governor Dukakis by 51% to 42%.    As we've indicated, we do not believe Senator Quayle was the best choice as Republican vice-presidential nominee, and the selection made us think less of George Bush. But we think better of him for standing by his man when the firestorm came. We have seen enough members of the Reagan administration blown away over next-to-nothing; it would have been a bad start for Mr. Bush if he were to allow that to happen to his vice-presidential selection   If Mr. Bush is to govern if elected, he will have to do better than his predecessor at standing behind his men and women. The Quayle inquisition was the first test, and George Bush acquitted himself with some imagination, steadiness and determination. </TEXT></DOC>
