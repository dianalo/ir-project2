The action put all but five MCorp subsidiary banks undergovernment ownership. Regulators transferred $11.6 billion indeposits of the failed banks to a new, government-ownedinstitution, Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank of Dallas.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures commercialbank deposits up to $100,000, said the failed banks opened forbusiness today and service to customers would continueuninterrupted.   ``As far as the customers are concerned it will be business asusual for all 20 banks,'' said L. William Seidman, chairman of theFDIC.   Seidman would not estimate how much the government willultimately have to spend to restore the banks to health, saying hedid not want to reveal that figure to investors expected to bid onthe banks.   However, private analysts have said they expect the failure willcost the FDIC, already depleted by a post-Depression record 221bank failures last year, $1 billion to $2 billion.   That would make the transaction the third most costly commercialbank rescue, after First RepublicBank of Dallas in 1988 ContinentalIllinois of Chicago in 1984.   ``We are going to proceed with the sale as promptly aspossible,'' Seidman said, but he added that the agency may extendits April 3 deadline for offers.   MCorp, which has 86 offices, lost $903 million last year. It isthe last of the large Texas banks to needing to be recapitalized,either through federal rescue or private merger.   In a statement today, MCorp said the five remaining banks andthe trust subsidiary ``form the nucleus of a new beginning forMCorp'' which still intends to file for bankruptcy protection.   ``While the nature of of MCorp has been altered dramatically, asolid, healthy core remains,'' Chairman Gene H. Bishop said. ``Weare extremely pleased that this group of five MBanks had thestrength and resourcefulness to withstand the incredible pressuresof the economic downturn over the past several years.''   Regulators said the 20 insolvent banks had assets of $15.4billion, including assets of $6.4 billion at the lead bank inDallas and $3.2 billion at the next biggest subsidiary in Houston.The five remaining insolvent banks have assets of about $3 billion.   Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke, the chief regulatorof nationally chartered banks, the figure was triggered by demandsbeginning Monday on the lead bank in Dallas, both from depositorsand from the other banks in the holding company.   On Tuesday, ``it became clear as the day wore on that the(Dallas) bank was not going to be able to meet the demands ofdepositors,'' Clarke said. Five of the banks were insolventstanding on their own and the remaining 15 failed after the Dallasbank could not meet their demands for deposits. The demands of alloutside customers were met, he said.   Federal action was complicated by the fact that regulatorslegally could not take control of the five MCorp subsidiary banksthat remain solvent. The move against the 20 has triggered a battleover assets held by the holding company. Regulators maintain thatholding company assests should be used to defer federal costs inrescuing the insolvent subsidiary banks, but MCorp has resistedthat.   ``The FDIC intends to pursue potential claims against MCorp forliabilities and obligations of MCorp to the 20 subsidiary banksthat were closed,'' the agency said in a statement.   Seidman, the FDIC chairman, declined to say how large the claimagainst the holding company is except to say it is ``substantial''and ``material.'' Since last year, the insurance fund had beentrying to force the holding company to inject $400 million into 18of its banks.   For future cases, the FDIC is seeking legislation from Congressthat would permit it to force solvent subsidiary banks to back upsister institutions that fail.   The FDIC's move came a week after creditors of MCorp forced itto seek protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.The holding company had halted payments on $466 million in debtlast October but had asked creditors to refrain from pressing theirclaims while it attempted to work out an assistance agreement withthe FDIC.   Reportedly among those interested in buying MCorp is A. RobertAbboud, chairman of First City Bancorporation in Houston, which wasitself rescued by the FDIC in 1987 with $1 billion.   Other likely bidders are Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., thePritzker family of Chicago and a group led by Harry Gray, formerchairman of United Technologies Corp.   The 20 MCorp banks seized today were: MBank Abilene, MBankAlamo, MBank Austin, MBank Brenham, MBank Corsicana, MBank Dallas,MBank Denton County, MBank Fort Worth, MBank Greenville, MBankHouston, MBank Jefferson, MBank Longview, MBank Marshall, MBankMidcities, MBank Odessa, MBank Orange, MBank Round Rock, MBankSherman, MBank Wichita Falls and MBank The Woodlands.   The five remaining solvent banks are MBank Brownsville, MBankCorpus Christi, MBank Waco, MBank El Paso and MBank New Braunfels.A six subsidiary, MTrust Corp., also remains solvent.   All creditors and depositors, even those with accounts higherthan the $100,000 insurance limit, are fully protected at all ofthe failed banks, except the subsidiary in Abilene. Depositors withmore than $100,000 in that institution will have to pursue a claimagainst the bank and may lose a portion of their uninsured funds.   The FDIC appointed James Gardner, chairman of MBank Dallas, aspresident of its new government-owned holding company. It said itwill seek a new chairman from outside the MCorp system.</TEXT></DOC>
