For an argon plasma,the development and use of a collisional-radiative, steady-state, three-energy-levelmodel is presented, and experimental measurements on pulsed argon plasmasare briefly mentioned. Two different theoretical argon plasma modelsare discussed; the first is numerically solved using a non-Maxwellianelectron distribution function, while the second is solved analytically,including atom-atom inelastic collisions, assuming Maxwellian electronand atom distribution functions. For a hydrogen plasma, experimentalmeasurements using fluorescence and laser-induced fluorescence have beenmade in a modified hydrogen thyratron over a wide current density range(from 100 to 8000 A/cm{sup 2}) for the atomic hydrogen population densitiesn = 2,3,4. A pronounced rise in the atomic hydrogen excited state populationsis observed after the end of the current pulse. A new method to measurethe time-resolved electron density was developed and results are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
