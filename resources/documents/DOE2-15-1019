To the author's knowledge there is no otherseismic zone on earth where the time, place, and magnitude of an impendingearthquake are specified as precisely. Moreover, the epicentral regionis located on continental crust, is readily accessible, and can supporta range of dense monitoring networks that are sited either on or veryclose to the expected rupture surface. As a result, the networks locatedat Parkfield are several orders of magnitude more sensitive than anypreviously deployed for monitoring precursory strain, seismicity, andother geophysical parameters. The measurements being made at Parkfieldwill clarify the mechanics of the earthquake cycle on several time scales.First, the existing store of regional seismicity and geodetic data, augmentedsince 1978 by increasingly densified instrumentation, document the smallearthquake activity and interseismic crustal straining that have occurredsince the 1966 shock. Instrumentation now in place for continuous orperiodic monitoring of seismic and crustal strain-related parameterswill supply unequalled detail on the final years (and minutes) of thecycle. Seismic data and geodetic measurements will determine the dynamicdetails of slip progression and the final distribution of fault offset,both of which can be related to interseismic fault slip and seismicity,especially those characteristics documented near the end of the cycle.The paper discusses interseismic deformation and seismicity and precursorymechanics.</TEXT></DOC>
