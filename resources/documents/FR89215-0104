Consideration of Issuance ofAmendment to Facility Operating License and Proposed No Significant Hazards;Consideration Determination and Opportunity for Hearing</ITAG>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is consideringissuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DPR-65, issuedto Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (the licensee), for operation of theMillstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit 2, located in New London County,Connecticut.The proposed amendment would allow operation of Millstone Unit 2 for Cycle10. The changes to the Technical Specifications (TS) are required to reflecta revised safety analysis that includes the use of fuel designed and fabricatedby Advanced Nuclear Fuels Corporation (ANF). Fuel designed and fabricatedby ANF has not been previously utilized for Millstone Unit 2. The proposedchanges to the TS also reflect the effects of reduced reactor coolant systemflow, from 340,000 to 325,000 gpm for Cycle 10.Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission willhave made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended(the Act) and the Commission's regulations.The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment requestinvolves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulationsin 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordancewith the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety.As part of the licensee's submittal dated February 1, 1989, the licensee/(or NNECO) has addressed the various technical issues related to the ``NoSignificant Hazards Consideration'' criteria of 10 CFR 50.92. The licenseehas stated that the proposed changes to the TS would not:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">ANF reviewed all SRP Chapter 15 postulated accidents and transientsto determine which events needed to be reanalyzed for Cycle 10, assumingthe proposed minimum RCS flow [associated] compensating Technical Specificationchanges. As a result, ANF identified and reanalyzed the three non-LOCAevents in which DNBR could be impacted by a decrease in RCS flow rate orthe reduction in F<T2>r</T2>T ANF also reanalyzed small break LOCA and large break LOCA scenarios.On the basis of this review and reanalysis, NNECO concludes that thereis no significant increase in the probability or consequences of any ofthese events.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With respect to calculated consequences, the proposed changes weredetermined to have no significant impact on protective boundaries. Therefore,there will be no significant change in any dose consequences related tothe [Standard Review Plan] SRP Chapter 15 anticipated operations occurrencesand postulated accidents. However, with respect to consequences. ANF alsospecifically reanalyzed the impact of the events on the relevant key parametersassociated with the plant response to the event.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The analysis showed that there are some instances in which there isa small increase in the limiting value of the relevant plant parameter.In all cases, however, the values of the parameters remain within acceptableacceptance criteria and there are no impacts on protective boundaries.NNECO therefore concludes that the proposed amendment does not involvea significant increase in the consequences of any event previously analyzed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">More specifically, the relevant non-LOCA event critieria that couldbe impacted by a decrease in RCS flow rate are RCS pressurization, fuelcenterline melt, and DNBR. However, ANF determined that, of these, onlyDNBR consequences could be significantly impacted by decrease in RCS flowrate and/or reduction in F<T2>r</T2>T. The three limiting DNB events considered are the loss of flow,the locked rotor, and the rod ejection events.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The loss of flow event is the limiting DNB event and a determinationof margin to the DNB limit for this event demonstrates sufficient marginfor the other events. For this event, the reduced flow analysis demonstrateda decrease in deterministic MDNBR from 0.98 to 0.93. However, a statisticalevaluation showed that this analysis remains within applicable acceptancecriteria and the small change does not represent a significant increasein consequences of the event.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The locked rotor event was reanalyzed because the original analysisshowed no fuel failures, based on the DNB margin available in the originalloss of flow analysis. Deterministic MDNBR was calculated to change from0.96 to 0.91. As for the previous event, this MDNBR change does not representa significant increase in consequences. Nevertheless, the previous lockedrotor analysis for Millstone Unit No. 2 showed that there would be no DNBin the core. The corresponding reduced flow analysis performed by ANF tosupport this amendment application does not show the potential for someDNB occurring. However, the locked rotor event is a limiting fault andthe DNB limits are not applicable. The predicted fuel failures are insteadbounded by the consequencs of the rod ejection accident. This boundingof consequences of a locked rotor event by the consequences of the rodinjection accident is acceptable because the rod ejection consequencesmeet the more restrictive infrequent event criteria.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With respect to control rod ejection, this event is the limiting eventwith regard to predicted fuel failures. As a result of the proposed changesto Technical Specifications, the predicted number of cladding failuresfor the rod ejection accident increased from 11.5% to 11.7%. This smallincrease is not considered to involve a significant increase in consequencesof the previously analyzed event.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The LOCA analyses for reduced flow conditions show a reduction inboth of the key plant parameters: calculated peak clad temperatures andcalculated amount of clad oxidation. This results because the effects ofthe reduced flow are more than compensated for by the reduction in LHRlimits. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not result in an increasein consequences of any LOCA event previously analyzed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The peak postaccident containment temperature is also potentiallyincreased by this change. However, the values remain below the 289 anddegrees;Fcontainment design temperature. The 0.7 anddegrees;F increase is not consideredsignificant relative to the 287.9 anddegrees;F peak temperature previouslycalculated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With respect to the probability of occurrence of an accident previouslyanalyzed, there will be no change in the probability of any design basisaccident. There are no hardware modifications associated with the proposedTechnical Specification changes and there is no significant impact on theperformance of any safety system. As a result, there is no change to theprobability of any of the initiating events for design basis accidents.There are also no changes or new failure modes associated with the changesthat will increase the probability of an accident or transient to the pointwhere it should be considered to be within the design basis. In this respect,therefore, NNECO concludes that no significant hazards consideration isinvolved.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany previously analyzed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As a result of the proposed Technical Specification changes, therewill be no changes to plant hardware or response. The plant will respondfor all events in a manner similar to that assumed for the previous analyses.The only changes identified in the reanalysis of the SRP Chapter 15 eventsrelate to the impact of certain transients on parameters related to boundaryperformance. There are no changes to the basic trends the transients follow.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are no failure modes associated with the proposed amendmentthat could represent a new unanalyzed accident. Therefore, NNECO concludesthat the proposed amendment does not create any new or different kind ofaccident from those previously analyzed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Involve a significant reduction in any margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As discussed under the first criterion above, ANF specifically reviewedall SRP Chapter 15 postulated accidents and anticipated operational occurrencesto determine any potential impact as a result of the proposed amendment.ANF specifically reanalyzed the three non-LOCA events in which DNBR couldbe impacted by a decrease in RCS flow rate or a reduction in FTR. ANF alsoreanalyzed small break and large break LOCA scenarios for impact on calculatedpeak clad temperature and on the calculated amount of clad oxidation. Onthe basis of this review and reanalysis, NNECO concludes that the proposedamendment does not involve a significant reduction in any margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As discussed above, the proposed Technical Specification changes doinvolve some nonsignficant changes in plant parameters related to boundaryperformance. However, in all cases, the limiting value of the parameterremains within applicable acceptance criteria and therefore the changeswill have no impact on the ability of the boundary to perform its function.Moreover, in all cases where margin to the acceptance criterion is reduced,the reduction is not significant.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The changes in limiting values of relevant parameters calculated inthe reanalysis of SRP Chapter 15 events, assuming lowered RCS flow rate,are discussed in detail above. The three cases in which there will be asmall reduction in margin are the three non-LOCA events involving DNBR.These may be summarized as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The loss of flow event in the limiting DNB event. For thisevent the reduced flow analysis demonstrated a decrease in deterministicMDNBR from 0.98 to 0.93. This change of only 0.05, is not considered torepresent a significant reduction in the margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; For the locked rotor event, DNB margin was also reduced by0.05, as calculated deterministic MDNBR changed from 0.96 to 0.91. Thischange also is not considered to represent a significant reduction in themargin of safety. Fuel failures in this scenario are bounded by fuel failuresfor the rod ejection event.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; For the rod ejection event, the number of rods potentiallyexperiencing cladding failures was increased from 11.5% to 11.7%. Thisis not considered to represent a significant reduction in the margin ofsafety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the LOCA scenarios reanalyzed, margins with respect to limitsfor peak clad temperature and clad oxidation actually increased.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The reduction in RCS flow will result in an increase in the hot legtemperatures by up to 2.5 anddegrees;F, with a new maximum temperature of608.5 anddegrees;F. However, this remains well below the RCS design temperatureof 650 anddegrees;F. In summary, the proposed amendent does not involve anysignificant reduction in a margin of safety and, therefore, does not involvea significant hazards consideration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In summary, the proposed amendment does not involve any significantreduction in a margin of safety and, therefore, does not involve a significanthazard consideration.</ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed and concurs in the licensees ``No SignificantHazard Consideration'' findings; therefore, based on the above considerations,the Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment requestinvolves no significant hazards considerations.The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing.Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene are discussed below.By March 17, 1989, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Request for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) Thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspects(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above.Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include alist of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendments under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participatedas a party.Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards considerations. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held.If the final determination is that the request for amendment involves nosignificant hazards considerations, the Commission may issue the amendmentand make it effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearingheld would take place after issuance of the amendment.If a final determination is that the amendment involves significant hazardsconsideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance ofany amendment.Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received. Should the Commission take thisaction, it will publish a notice of issuance and provide for opportunityfor a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to takethis action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW. Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions arefiled during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at (800) 325-6000 (in Missouri (800) 342-6700). TheWestern Union operator should be given Datagram identification Number 3737and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz: petitioner's nameand telephone number; date petition was mailed; plant name; and publicationdate and page number of this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry and Howard,One Constitution Plaza, Hartford, Connecticut 06103.Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer of theAtomic Safety and Licensing Board designated to rule on the petition and/orrequest, that the petitioner has made a substantial showing of good causefor the granting of a late petition and/or request. That determinationwill be based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v)and 2.714(d).For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated February 1, 1989, which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Local Public Document Room.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 10th day of February, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">David H.
