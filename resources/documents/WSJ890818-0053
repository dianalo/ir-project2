Rep. Rostenkowski barely cracked a smile.    To members of the powerful tax-writing panel, especially its chairman, the 200th birthday of the House's oldest committee isn't anything to be made light of. In fact, Ways and Means has raised in excess of three quarters of a million dollars -- almost all of it from corporations and unions -- to help finance a multimedia self-congratulatory celebration.    That doesn't sit well with some observers. &quot;It's just another opportunity for the corporate and labor leaders to be benefactors for members of Congress,&quot; says Ellen Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a bipartisan, public interest research group. &quot;And in this day and age, that means access.&quot;    Mr. Rostenkowski is on vacation and couldn't be reached for comment but said through a spokesman: &quot;I thought it was a good way to study our past, celebrate our history, and think about our future.&quot; Adds former Ways and Means Chairman Wilbur Mills, one of the participants in the events marking the bicentennial: &quot;I thought the fund raising was excellently done. They raised the money from private sources -- it wasn't drawn from government money.&quot;    Committee staff bristled at the charge of access-buying. &quot;Look at the record,&quot; said one staff member. &quot;Is there any evidence that anyone got anything other than a feeling of good citizenship? We'd like to hear a real concern.&quot; Donors are quick to deny any sinister or underhanded motives in their participation. But W. Minor Carter, senior vice president of U.S. Fidelity andamp; Guaranty Co., which gave $25,000, observes: &quot;We're not dopes, you know. We know that if you get to do something helpful for a powerful body like Ways and Means, it could turn out good for you later.&quot;    And American Express Co. spokesman Larry Armour acknowledges: &quot;Everyone wants to be on the good side of the chairman of this particular committee. I would be lying if I didn't admit that.&quot;    Contributors to the Ways and Means festivities, which include a bicentennial movie, book and dinner, constitute an impressive who's who of American business. To get things started, Rep. Rostenkowski contacted American Express Chairman James Robinson. Mr. Robinson then called up a few of his friends, notably chairmen John Akers of International Business Machines Corp. and John Welch of General Electric Co. Mr. Rostenkowski added a few other names, including several from his hometown, and presto, &quot;The dollars just came pouring in. It hasn't really stopped yet,&quot; says Donald Kennon of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, the nonprofit group that is organizing the celebration.    Twenty-two companies gave $25,000 each. Even some that weren't asked, such as Sara Lee Corp., sent in checks when they found out. Unions also chipped in: The Teamsters shelled out $10,000 and the Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers sent in $5,000. Donald Trump kicked in $10,000. At last count, 40 corporations and unions have bankrolled a celebration fund that the Historical Society says totals $768,948.67.    Embarrassed Ways and Means Committee aides refuse to talk about how much has been collected, and only reluctantly divulge a list of donors. Some contributors, however, are eager to associate themselves with the patriotic and educational aspects of their participation. Says Mr. Armour of American Express, echoing the lines of other sponsors: &quot;We love to be patriotic. For God's sakes, this is part of Americana, this is part of the country.&quot; IBM, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and Philip Morris Cos. representatives characterize their companies' contributions as &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;cultural.&quot;    The committee will spend about half a million dollars on an hour-long PBS documentary of its history. About one-third of the 22-minute preview shown at a July 24 celebratory dinner featured Chairman Rostenkowski, although there have been 59 other chairmen.    &quot;It was like home movies for those guys,&quot; film-maker Steven York, who has made PBS films on the Supreme Court, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and the West Bank, says of the showing. &quot;The catcalls, boos, hisses, and laughter when George Bush's 'read my lips' pledge came on went up to the ceiling.&quot;    The scholarly history of the committee, a 526-page, four-pound tome, will cost at least $100,000 in salaries and research, editing and design costs. Printing costs are being borne by the government, and the book is being distributed free to the public out of boxes in a committee office. Mr. Kennon, a co-author, hopes the work will merit favorable review by critics and professors.    &quot;I received no interference from the committee or the chairman,&quot; he says. &quot;Quite frankly, I can't picture him ever sitting down and reading it.&quot; The book's success has even encouraged the House Agriculture Committee to approach him about preparing a history of that panel, Mr. Kennon says.    Another $100,000 will pay for the July dinner, which brought together current and former committee members, including President Bush and former Chairman Mills. The cost includes $10,022.65 for gold cuff links and stickpins given to past and present members, $3,400 for water pitchers, $5,416 to rent a movie projector, and $70,685 for hardcover committee histories. Bills for food, flowers, and photographers aren't in yet.    During a lunch for past and present committee members, Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.) told the audience that the cuff links would be the only thing they'd receive during the bicentennial celebration without Mr. Rostenkowski's picture on them. Whereupon Mr. Rostenkowski rose and asked for the return of the cuff links, saying the mistake would be corrected.    Ways and Means' isn't the only bicentennial celebration this year. Congress itself is also marking its 200th birthday, and lawmakers are tapping some of the same contributors Mr. Rostenkowski's committee did. Those funds will be used to help refurbish parts of the Capitol. Philip Morris donated $250,000 to pay for a June 20 bash chaired by Loews Corp. Ppresident Preston R. Tisch that brought in more than $1 million thanks to several big corporate gifts and a $1,000-a-plate ticket price.    Mr. Tisch and Senate Appropriations Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) hope to raise more money through the sale of bicentennial gold and silver coin sets. Congressmen want to use the money to restore the 126-year-old bronze statue of Freedom atop the Capitol, to install some fountains, and &quot;to solicit fine art and other property.&quot; Mr. Tisch also talks of building a pedestrian mall between the Supreme Court and the Capitol.    Besides Ways and Means, there is only one other House panel that can boast its 200th birthday this year, according to House historian Ray Smock. That is the Elections panel, once a separate committee and now an obscure subcommittee of the House Administration Committee.    But news of the honor comes as a surprise even to staff members of that panel. &quot;No one has come to us offering us money,&quot; says one staffer. &quot;There's been no fund raising or celebrations around here.&quot;    ---@ Big Givers    Major contributors to the Ways and Means Committee's bicentennial celebration:    $25,000    American Express American Telephone andamp; Telegraph    Anheuser-Busch    Arkansas Electric Cooperative    Beneficial Management    Chicago Mercantile Exchange    General Electric    General Motors    Hewlett-Packard    International Business Machines    Johnson andamp; Johnson    Kraft General Foods    (subs.
