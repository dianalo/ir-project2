The three computers, which are intended for business users and compete with International Business Machines Corp.'s PC AT and XT-286 computers, will be priced the same as Compaq's previous Deskpro 286 models. The basic model has a suggested price of $2,999.    The Deskpro 286 is the second Compaq product in as many months to take advantage of a speedier version of Intel Corp.'s popular 80286 microchip. The chip, a tiny but complex piece of silicon that performs the computer's operations, operates at a speed of 12 megahertz; microprocessors in Compaq's previous Deskpro 286 models operated at eight MHz.    Last month, Houston-based Compaq became the first major computer supplier to make use of the speedier chip when it unveiled a new portable computer. Analysts said one or two small suppliers also have introduced computers using the faster chip, but other major computer makers such as IBM have been precluded from doing so because of the chip's limited supply. Most computer concerns are expected to start using the chip in their future models, however.    While IBM isn't expected to introduce major improvements in its product line before next month at the earliest, it may announce as many as three new models at that time.    &quot;The problem has been getting it (the faster chip) in a high enough quantity at a price that's competitive with the eight MHz. chip,&quot; said Seymour Merrin, vice president of Gartner Group, a Stamford, Conn.-based market research firm.    Norm DeWitt, a director of personal computer services for Dataquest Inc. of San Jose, Calif., added that the Compaq move would force other personal computer makers to introduce products with the faster chip -- a move that, in turn, would pressure Intel to boost its production. He said about 30% of Intel's 286 production is for chips that operate at speeds of at least 10 Mhz.    Compaq said it believes it has an adequate supply of the chips. &quot;But if the market demand turns out stronger than we forecast, we could be in a shortage situation,&quot; said Mike Swavely, Compaq's vice president of marketing.    Analysts said the move further bolsters Compaq's recent efforts to become a technological leader in an industry that long has followed IBM's lead. Last September, Compaq forged ahead with a new generation of personal computers based on Intel's potent new 80386 microchip. IBM has yet to unveil its 386-based model. </TEXT></DOC>
