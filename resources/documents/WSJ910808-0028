But an immediate firming of petroleum prices was quicklyoffset by renewed prospects that the United Nations SecurityCouncil will allow Iraq to export oil -- perhaps as much as500,000 barrels a day for six months -- to pay for emergencypurchases of food and medicine.</LP><TEXT>   As a result of these developments, trading in world oilmarkets was hectic and choppy, generally leaving petroleumprices on an uncertain note after a day of wide swings.   &quot;Basically, the market got a lift from various problems inthe North Sea, but after the U.N. news came out there was apanicky sell-off,&quot; said Shahrokh Nikkhah, executive vicepresident of Refco Inc., New York.   Despite the volatility, prices of petroleum ended tradingrelatively flat in European and U.S. futures markets.   On the International Petroleum Exchange in London, Brentblend crude for September delivery traded in a broad range of42 cents a barrel. It settled unchanged at $19.43 a barrel.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil forSeptember delivery ended one cent a barrel lower after aswing of 52 cents during the day. It settled at $21.36.October crude ended unchanged at $21.30 a barrel.   Trading was heavy on both exchanges. On the New YorkMercantile Exchange, more than 105,000 crude contracts weretraded.   In U.S. futures trading, gasoline remained relativelystrong after the one-day pullback on Tuesday. Septembergasoline was down nearly one cent a gallon at one point butbounced back to settle a fraction of a cent higher at 66.81cents a gallon.   Prices surged in most oil markets early yesterday afterShell U.K. Exploration and Production, the North Seaexploration and production unit of the Royal Dutch/ShellGroup, confirmed that several explosions had taken place onits Fulmar Alpha platform. There were three injuries, andsome of the 121 personnel aboard the platform were evacuated,Shell said in a statement.   Later, however, Shell reported that damage apparently waslimited to the personnel's living quarters. &quot;The integrity ofthe platform has not been threatened, and an initialinspection has indicated no structural damage,&quot; Shell said.Units of Amerada Hess Corp., Exxon Corp. and Amoco Corp.participate in the Fulmar field, although Shell is theoperator.   Production already had been closed down because of a gasalert, Shell said. Also, output recently had been sharplyreduced from May's level of 137,134 barrels a day because ofmaintenance on the platform. On Tuesday, the last full day ofoperation, production was back up to 118,000 barrels. Shell'sAuk field, which produced 5,172 barrels a day in June, andBritish Petroleum Co.'s Clyde field, with 37,000 barrels aday in output, also had to be closed.   Although the news of the North Sea incident pushed up oilprices, bearish sentiment again swept the oil markets andsent prices tumbling after a report from New York on thelikely status of Iraq's request to resume exports of oil.Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,told reporters in New York that the five permanent members ofthe U.N. Security Council were &quot;very close&quot; to an agreementthat would allow Iraq to sell some oil.   According to the U.S. envoy, a draft resolution wouldpermit Iraq to market $1.5 billion of oil over a six-monthperiod for humanitarian reasons. Iraq could use the money tobuy food and medicine and for other humanitarian purposesallowed by the U.N.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK andamp; MEATS: Prices of cattle futures contractsplunged their daily permissible limit of 1.5 cents a poundamid signs that the nation's feedlots are brimming withfattened cattle. &quot;The feedlots have too many cattle,&quot; saidDennis Smith, a livestock analyst at Linnco Futures GroupInc., Chicago. &quot;Everything is on the skids.&quot; The nation'smeatpackers, which were stung by a shortage of cattle earlierthis year, are lowering their bids for the animals, reasoningthat the feedlots eventually will have to accept their lowerprice, some traders said. Cattle prices also are beingdepressed by weak demand for beef from retailers. In tradingat the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the cattle contract forAugust delivery dropped the limit of 1.5 cents a pound andsettled at 67 cents a pound.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices rallied. Copper for Septemberdelivery ended 1.75 cents a pound higher at $1.0255. RichardHirsch, vice president of Sharps Pixley, said physical copperbusiness in the U.S. has improved slightly. The premium forcopper cathode has increased to between 2.25 cents to 2.5cents over the futures price, the highest so far this yearand up from two cents last week. The premium has been as lowas 1.5 cents this year, Mr. Hirsch said. There also may havebeen some buying based on worries about the continuing strikeat Codelco's El Teniente mine in Chile, he added. Most of thebuying, however, was based on technical factors, such as theprice rising above $1.024, an area of resistance, he said.Trading volume was light, he added, and rallies are easier tosustain in a thin market.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices declined amid selling by investorswho were disappointed that the price failed to rise above83.35 cents a pound, the level it had traded at for the pasttwo days, analysts said. Coffee for September delivery endedat 81.65 cents, down 0.8 cent. Traders aren't taking bigpositions because they're uncertain what to expect at theSeptember meeting of the International Coffee Organization inLondon, said Esther Eskenasy, a coffee analyst at CargillInvestor Services. The low prices have brought producingcountries together to discuss a possible return tointernational export quotas, she said. &quot;I have a feeling thatif the market remains at these depressed levels, a lot ofcountries that have favored a free market will be inclined tosupport export quotas, because everyone is losing money rightnow,&quot; Ms. Eskenasy said. Buying by coffee dealers willprobably provide support at around 80 cents, but if pricesfall below 80 cents, the next area of support will be between78 cents to 79.5 cents, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
