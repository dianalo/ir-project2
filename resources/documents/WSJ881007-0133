Currently, client names are kept secret, though the exchange can order securities firms to disclose this information to regulators on a case-by-case basis. But John J. Phelan Jr., chairman of the Big Board, said in an interview that the exchange feels routine daily reporting of big institutions' activity would be &quot;an excellent idea.&quot; Such information would only be seen by regulators, he emphasized; it wouldn't be made public.    Mr. Phelan said the Big Board plans to issue a &quot;concept release&quot; in two weeks, spelling out its proposal and seeking public comment. He added that the exchange hopes to have a rule proposal &quot;before the (exchange) board by the end of the year.&quot;    Some top investment professionals were gnashing their teeth yesterday at the disclosure idea, though they didn't want to be quoted by name. The chairman of one major Wall Street firm called it &quot;crazy, totally insane.&quot; And the head of equity trading at another securities firm said: &quot;I don't think customers will like this. Do you really think this information is going to remain secret?&quot;    Mr. Phelan acknowledged that &quot;securities markets historically have been based on secrecy of buyers and sellers.&quot; But he said that while the Big Board files &quot;would be accessible for regulatory reasons,&quot; they wouldn't be available to a firm's Wall Street rivals. The exchange would keep the files, though they would be available to other regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission.    &quot;If there is another market crisis, we'd want to know who did what,&quot; Mr. Phelan explained. Under the current system, investigators of last October's stock-market crash were hard-pressed to piece together big sellers' roles. While Mr. Phelan didn't explicitly say so, the proposed disclosures could also help in insider-trading investigations, as well as in checking whether accumulators of major stakes in companies have reported their positions promptly to government regulators. The disclosure system would enable regulators to review large amounts of trading data with little effort.    Mr. Phelan said the Big Board would like its disclosure plan to be enacted along with similar rules in other markets. And he acknowledged that handling foreign trading in U.S. stocks would be a delicate issue. It's unclear how much cooperation the exchange could expect in trying to get information on foreign clients or brokers. The plan wouldn't, for example, identify anyone who traded through a bank, as foreign investors often do.    A spokeswoman said the Big Board initially wants its disclosure rule to apply to &quot;institutions,&quot; but would later aim to extend it to all large traders, including individuals and partnerships. The exchange is still working on the precise definition of institutions, she added.    She also said the disclosure rule probably will apply only to trades above a certain size. That amount hasn't been specified, but the SEC staff, in a similar proposal last spring that hasn't been acted on by Congress, said it wanted the identity of customers reported on trades valued at $2 million or more. That would be equivalent to 50,000 shares of a $40 stock.    Some mainstream investors may actually welcome the disclosure plan. &quot;I wouldn't think we'd have any trouble with it,&quot; said John Neff, portfolio manager of the $5.7 billion Windsor mutual fund. &quot;We don't have anything to hide.&quot; And an attorney at a major Boston money manager said: &quot;It ought to make surveillance easier. As long as confidentiality is assured, I think it's useful.&quot;    But more aggressive investors aren't likely to be so serene. &quot;We try to tell people doing our trades as little as possible about who the parties are, or what the objectives are,&quot; said Gus Oliver, a partner in the New York investment firm of Coniston Partners. &quot;We think it's very important to preserve confidentiality.&quot; Coniston is known for building up sizable stakes in companies such as Gillette Co. and Allegis Corp., then pressing for corporate restructurings.    Currently, managers of $100 million or more of mutual-fund or pension assets must report their stockholdings quarterly to the SEC. These reports generally are filed several weeks after a quarter's end. In addition, holders of 5% or more of a company's stock must disclose their positions within 10 days of passing the 5% threshold.    &quot;There's an awful lot of information around already,&quot; Mr. Oliver observed. &quot;I'm not sure we need any more.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
