The fire season in the parched West has started six weeks earlier than usual, forcing the agency to bring on 10,000 seasonal firefighters ahead of schedule. Some 270 fires were burning yesterday on national forest lands, including a 57,000-acre blaze in the Custer National Forest in eastern Montana.    This spring's siege of hot, dry weather, following three years of below-normal rainfall, has left forests and tree plantations in much of the Southeast, the upper Midwest and the West highly vulnerable to lightning strikes and careless use of fire, Forest Service officials said.    &quot;Last year was the worst fire season in the West since 1919,&quot; said Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service. &quot;And we've got worse conditions right now than we had at this time last year.&quot;    Nearly five million acres of private and government-owned timber, valued at $1.2 billion, were destroyed by fire last year, and the timber industry is bracing for the worst this year. &quot;We think this drought has the potential to cause a terrific amount of fire damage,&quot; said Roberta Andersen, a vice president of the Sacramento-based Timber Association of California. &quot;I don't think anyone is crying wolf here. The situation is really bad.&quot;    The drought also threatens millions of tree seedlings planted this spring by the Forest Service, state forestry agencies and forest-products companies. Weyerhaeuser Co., for one, expects to lose 15% of its 38 million seedlings in the South. So far, Weyerhaeuser's seedling plantations in western Washington and Oregon are faring well, said John McMahon, vice president of timberlands for the Tacoma, Wash.-based company. Last year, Weyerhaeuser had to replant 4% of its seedlings nationwide.    Unless the drought breaks, state officials will have to close down logging operations later this summer, when fire hazards usually become extreme. A major cause of fires is sparking from chain saws.    &quot;Last year, we were totally shut down for weeks at a time in Oregon and Washington,&quot; said Mr. McMahon. &quot;That costs a lot of lost production.&quot;    Forests are so dry in some parts of the nation that one out of every three or four lightning strikes ignites a fire, rather than one out of every 10 last year, Forest Service officials said. The officials are also finding that fires, once started, are harder to control.    &quot;It's common to have dry grass and twigs, but now even large fallen trees are extremely dry,&quot; said John Chambers, the agency's assistant director of fire and aviation management. &quot;It's like putting six logs into your fireplace instead of one.&quot; As a result, he said, it takes eight firefighters to contain a fire that would normally require two.    &quot;I've been at this for 33 years,&quot; said Mic Amicarella, the fire and aviation management director, &quot;and I don't remember it being this dry this early.&quot;    Arizona's Tonto National Forest and Michigan's Hiawatha National Forest are the only areas where the fire &quot;severity potential&quot; is listed as extreme. But the Forest Service rates the fire hazard as &quot;high&quot; in heavily wooded Appalachia running from south-central Pennsylvania to northern Alabama, northern parts of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, as well as much of west Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Southern California and northern California to the east of the Sierra Nevadas.    The Forest Service has an air armada of about 1,800 aircraft to detect and fight fires this summer. It owns 35 fire-patrol and smoke-jumper planes, and it has 250 helicopters and 1,500 planes under contract, including 50-passenger Convairs for moving fire crews from one region to another and 30 air tankers for dropping water and flame retardants on fires.    Yesterday, the Forest Service was using five air tankers to bomb the big fire in the Custer National Forest with fire retardants. Last year, the agency recruited National Guard and Army units to help battle an 800,000-acre fire in northern California and southern Oregon, which destroyed 2.7 billion board feet of high-value timber -- enough to build a city the size of San Francisco. More than 28,000 Forest Service employees, loggers, soldiers and local volunteers took part in the four-day fight, and 10 persons were killed, some on the fire lines and some in a tanker crash.    &quot;We've got a lot of high-tech equipment,&quot; said Mr. Amicarella, &quot;but the most important tool we've got is the guy on the ground with a shovel.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
