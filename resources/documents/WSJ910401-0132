Mounting industry overcapacity and slack customer demandcombined to depress operating earnings for many chemicalcompanies in the first period, according to Wall Streetestimates.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;People are cutting prices to market new capacity that'scoming on line in the midst of a soft economy. That will makethis the worst year for the industry in the current cycle,&quot;says Anantha Raman, a securities analyst who heads his ownresearch firm in Parsippany, N.J.   Even the sharp drop in oil prices wasn't enough to bailout the quarter, adds William Young, a securities analystwith Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc. in New York. &quot;We hadhoped that a significant drop in feedstock costs followingthe end of the Persian Gulf war would boost results, butoverall the outlook is still pretty bad,&quot; he says.   Chemical industry operating profits were squeezedespecially hard in last year's second half as petrochemicalprices skyrocketed in step with crude oil prices followingIraq's invasion of Kuwait in August. Union Carbide Corp., forexample, says rising oil prices last August added $1.3million a day to its feedstock costs.   And with economic growth slowing markedly around the worldlate last year, chemical companies weren't able to pass alongthe full cost increases to customers. Even when they didraise many prices by year's end, price cuts were rapidlyforced on them by falling oil prices in the first quarter,says Theodore Semegran, a securities analyst with ShearsonLehman Brothers in New York.   A wild card overhanging the industry is the extent towhich certain companies may take inventory charges tied tothe changes in raw material costs in the first quarter,analysts say.   The chemical industry goes though periodic capacity bingesas several years of high profits, as occurred in the late1980s, lead chemical companies to build additional plants andprocessing facilities to cash in on boom times. But as theadditional plants come on line, as they are beginning to, theglut of products forces prices, and industry profits, lower.   Patricia O'Brien, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete WeddSecurities Inc. in New York, notes that industry productionof ethylene, a primary raw material in the chemical andplastics businesses, is expected to grow 4.9% annually thisyear and next, while the projected growth in annual demand isonly 2.8%   The capacity glut is particularly pronounced in thecurrent cycle for two reasons: leading world economies are inrecession, or growth is sluggish at best, and a raft ofchemical plants are being built overseas that will competewith U.S. producers.   Big commodity, as opposed to diversified and specialty,chemical companies are being hurt the worst: Dow ChemicalCo., the Midland, Mich., commodity chemical producer, isexpected to report first-quarter operating earnings of about90 cents to $1 a share, compared with year-earlier net incomeof $1.71 a share. &quot;They've been getting creamed in theirpetrochemical and plastics businesses,&quot; says Donaldson's Mr.Young. &quot;Their margins are really getting squeezed.&quot; Butfirst-quarter net will equal or exceed last year's afterincluding an 80-cent-a-share gain from proceeds of Dow'sinitial public stock offering of its subsidiary, DestecEnergy Inc.   Union Carbide, Danbury, Conn., also heavily reliant oncommodity chemicals such as polyethylene, is likely to reportoperating earnings of 40 cents to 50 cents a share, comparedwith year-ago net income of 66 cents a share. But thoseoperating estimates will be cut by about 13 cents a share sothat net income reflects the $18 million in &quot;lost profits&quot;for the quarter that the company said resulted from the March12 explosion and fire at its Seadrift, Texas, plant.   Du Pont Co. also has a giant commodity chemical business,but the slowdown in that sector is partially offset byrelative strength in the Wilmington, Del., company'soil-related businesses, namely its Conoco unit. Analystsexpect Du Pont to report net income of 70 cents to 75 cents ashare for the first quarter, down from the year-earlier 90cents a share.   Monsanto Co. is partly insulated from the downturn in itschemical businesses by having diversified into agriculturalchemicals and products, artificial sweeteners andpharmaceuticals, among other areas. Analysts expect the St.Louis-based company to report net income of $1.25 to $1.40 ashare, down from $1.47 a year ago.   American Cyanamid Co., Wayne, N.J., is expected to buckthe industry trend and post flat to modestly higher netincome for the first quarter, compared with the $1.01 a sharereported in 1990's first period. A strong presence inagri-chemicals and pharmaceuticals and medical productscounters the effect of the chemical industry cycle, analystssay.</TEXT></DOC>
