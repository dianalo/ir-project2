That's nice, but it's also a fairly narrow segment anddoesn't auger well for the kind of &quot;breakout&quot; film thatattracts diverse moviegoers, award nominations -- and bigbucks.</LP><TEXT>   But after research screenings on college campuses lastweek indicated that younger moviegoers like the film too, themarketing department at Universal Pictures has scrambled todevelop a new campaign that takes advantage of the movie'sbroader appeal. And none too soon. This weekend the number ofscreens showing the film will be expanded to 1,100 from 673.   &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes,&quot; what the movie industry calls &quot;alittle picture,&quot; is about a spunky woman who fights racismand sexism in Alabama in the 1930s, as told by an old womanliving in a nursing home. The producers hope the movie willdo great business this weekend and continue to play welluntil Feb. 19, when Oscar nominations will be announced.Their fondest dream is to win a best picture nomination andthen sail smoothly toward a box-office performance like thatof &quot;Driving Miss Daisy,&quot; the 1989 &quot;little picture&quot; that wonan Oscar for best movie and sold about $107 million oftickets domestically.   That may be an impossible dream. Despite an extensivemarketing campaign, with sneak previews in major cities andspecial screenings last month that included gift mini-cratesof real green tomatoes, the &quot;buzz&quot; on the film is only nowbeginning to spread. And critics question whether &quot;FriedGreen Tomatoes&quot; can snag a best picture nomination. &quot;DrivingMiss Daisy&quot; received extraordinary reviews as opposed tomildly favorable ones for &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes.&quot;   That hasn't deterred Universal, a unit of MatsushitaElectric Industrial Co.'s MCA division, which has workedovertime to recraft its marketing strategy. Among thechanges: TV commercials that previously focused on Ms. Tandyand Ms. Bates will show more of the film's younger actresses,Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker. Billboards andprint ads that featured cozy shots of the two lead actressesare being replaced by equally cozy shots of all four stars. Anew headline in ads invites moviegoers to &quot;Share `Tomatoes'With a Friend.&quot;   There will also be new TV spots featuring some of thecollege women who saw the picture last week; they'll offerrave testimonials. Since the recent research suggests thateven young men might be hooked by the film, a new commercialemphasizing the film's murder mystery subplot has beencrafted; another features men giving positive assessments ofthe movie. Some spots are also being shifted to shows withyounger audiences, such as &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; and Fox's&quot;Beverly Hills, 90210.&quot;   The quick about-face is a clear indication of theimportance of demographic research in Hollywood -- and theneed to constantly retest even after a film opens. &quot;Ourearlier research didn't really indicate that a young audiencewas going to be there,&quot; says Norman Lear, chairman of Act IIICommunications and one of the film's executive producers.&quot;But now we're going to feature those aspects of the dramathat are most interesting to young people.&quot; Universal hasalso arranged to book the younger actresses on &quot;Late Nightwith David Letterman&quot; and &quot;The Dennis Miller Show.&quot;   Film-marketing executives caution that even if Universalwins over the fairly narrow woman college market, &quot;FriedGreen Tomatoes&quot; still has to compete with a crowdedmarketplace of films targeting women. As its run expandstoday, 20th Century Fox Film opens &quot;Shining Through,&quot; abig-budget drama that stars Michael Douglas and MelanieGriffith as a secretary-turned-spy in World War II Germany.Also opening in select cities is Columbia Pictures' &quot;HardPromises,&quot; which stars Sissy Spacek. And &quot;The Prince ofTides&quot; and &quot;Father of the Bride,&quot; two holiday holdovers, arestill doing respectable business.   Universal's internal screening reports show that amajority of college students rated the film as either&quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;very good.&quot; Those two responses are whatstudios refer to on evaluation forms as &quot;the top two boxes,&quot;a favorable indicator for films that rely on word-of-mouth.At a screening held at the University of Pittsburgh, 92% ofstudents attending said they would &quot;definitely&quot; recommend thefilm to a friend.   Many of the students named as their favorite scene one inwhich Ms. Bates, driving a car, repeatedly smashes intoanother vehicle that pulled into a parking spot she wanted.(Students said they had already seen the segment in TVcommercials but laughed anyway.) They also liked a food fightscene. And in an indication that some college women may beable to drag their boyfriends along, a 19-year-old malestudent at the University of Minnesota wrote: &quot;Really thoughtit was good for a tearjerking chick movie.&quot;   Universal's distribution plan is somewhat similar to thestrategy used by Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc.,for &quot;Driving Miss Daisy.&quot; &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes,&quot; which costa relatively low $11 million to make, opened in a handful oftheaters in select cities just before the end of the year.That allowed it to qualify for this year's Oscars but wasalso part of a studio tactic known as &quot;platforming,&quot; in whichthe number of screens increases weekly to buildword-of-mouth.   Last weekend, playing on 673 screens, &quot;Fried GreenTomatoes&quot; took in a healthy $5.2 million, for an impressiveper-screen average of $7,780, according to Daily Variety.That was up from the previous weekend's take of $797,154 on35 screens, and enough to make it the second highest grossingfilm for the week. Even so, some rival studio executives saythey had expected the film to gross $6 million or more. Thisweekend, the film's producers admit, will be the key. Mr.Lear says the film is selling more tickets &quot;day for day&quot; than&quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; did at this point in its run.   Universal hasn't been filling Hollywood trade papers withads soliciting Oscar nominations. But a one-line letter Mr.Lear sent to 5,000 Academy members prompted such a responsethat the studio has added five special Academy screenings ofthe movie. The one-line message: &quot;If this note is responsiblefor your seeing `Fried Green Tomatoes,' you'll owe me one]&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
