(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>IA0106andM;Backed by better-than-average service and support policies and selling viamail order for a decent list price, ACMA Computers' 486/33 EngineeringWorkstation is a respectable machine that should serve engineers, networkmanagers, and graphics users equally well.andM;Even in its $5,895 basic configuration, the ACMA 486/33 is well stocked,including 4MB of RAM, a 128K processor RAM cache, an 18-millisecond 150MB NEChard disk, both 1.2MB and 1.44MB TEAC floppy disk drives, an ACMA VGA adapterand Helms Engineering Impressions Super VGA monitor, and DOS 3.3 or 4.01.andO;Boost the RAM to 8MB and substitute an 18-ms.andP;  210MB Rodime IDE hard disk andthe system lists for $6,225.andP;  Rounding out the picture are a 101-keyMaxi-Switch keyboard and one parallel and two serial ports and a game port.andM;Going those configurations one better, our $7,195 tested system came with anOrchid ProDesigner II Super VGA board with 1MB of video RAM and a SeikoCM-1450C Super VGA monitor-a combination capable of producing noninterlacedvideo with a maximum resolution of 1,024 by 768 pixels.andP;  Also included wereMicrosoft Windows 3.0, a serial Microsoft Mouse, and an upgraded 450-watt PCPower and Cooling power supply with five device connectors.andM;The ACMA 486/33's 25.5- by 7.5- by 17.5-inch tower case provides room for sixhalf-height 5.25-inch drives; if you choose to attach the included systemstand, the unit measures 9.5 inches wide at its base.andP;  In addition to thehard disk options already mentioned, ACMA offers 80MB and 105MB IDE drivesand 338MB and 676MB ESDI drives as well as 60MB/ 120MB and 150MB internaltape backup units.andP;  On the front panel of the case are power, reset, andturbo switches, a turbo indicator, and an electronic keyboard lock.andP;  The unitdoes not have a mechanical case lock.andM;The ACMA 486/33 is one of several machines reviewed in this issue that usesthe AMI Voyager motherboard, which allows the system to hold 24MB of 32-bitsystem RAM and which gets its smarts from a Chips and Technologies 486 chipset and an AMI BIOS.andP;  You can install 8MB of RAM on the motherboard using 1MBSIMMs; our evaluation unit came with 60-nanosecond modules.andP;  To bring thesystem RAM up to the maximum, you'll have to buy a $225 memory card, whichfits into the machine's single 32-bit expansion slot, and fill it with up to16MB more memory.andP;  ACMA's current price is $90 per megabyte.andM;In addition to the 32-bit slot, which can also accept standard 8-bit cards,the AMI motherboard has one 8-bit and six 16-bit slots.andP;  With I/O, driveinterface, and video cards installed, our test system was left with fiveslots free.andM;You can set the processor to run at one of several speeds (8, 12, 16, 20,25,and 33 MHz) through software, and you can change the bus speed by replacingthe socketed I/O bus crystal.andP;  The standard crystal runs the bus at between 7and 9 MHz, but other crystals are available in case your peripherals supportfaster I/O.andP;  This adaptability may mean more in the future as fasterinterface cards become available.andM;The ACMA 486/33 Engineering Workstations's standard, nonupgradable 128Kprocessor RAM cache uses discrete logic and comprises 25-ns.andP;  static-RAM DIPchips.andP;  System BIOS is always shadowed in RAM, but you can choose whether ornot to shadow the video BIOS instructions.andP;  A socket on the motherboardaccommodates a 33-MHz Weitek 4167 math coprocessor.andM;On PC Magazine Labs' benchmark tests, the ACMA 486/33 fared well overall,with performance that ranged from exceptionally fast to relatively slow.andP;  Ittied with several other machines for first place on our Conventional Memorytest, and earned the second-highest score (along with several others) on our80486 Instruction Mix test.andP;  Its video performance was faster than average,but its hard disk scores were slower than almost all the other machines.andM;ACMA Computers stands behind this system with a warranty for one year onparts and two years labor.andP;  Also standard are on-site service by TRW and a45-day money-back guarantee.andP;  Should you need technical assistance, you cancall ACMA's toll-free technical support line.andP;  The computer ships with aClass A certification from the FCC.andM;In all, the ACMA 486/33 Engineering Workstation is a fairly priced systemfrom a vendor with a solid reputation and above-average service and supportpolicies.andP;  Whether it is used for engineering applications or as a fileserver or graphics platform, this computer is easy to recommend.andM;ACMA 486/33andM;EngineeringandM;WorkstationandM;ACMA ComputersandM;Inc., 117 FourierandM;Ave., Fremont, CAandM;94539;
