Oxidation was carriedout at 225 and 300/sup 0/C in 1 Torr O/sub 2/. The rate and extent ofoxidation varied with the choice of face, decreasing along the series:(111) andgt; (110) andgt; (100) andgt; (polycrystalline). At 225/sup 0/C a surface layerof U/sub 3/O/sub 7/ several {mu}m thick was formed on all the samples.The (111) surface showed the first signs of oxide cracking due to latticecontraction experience by the cubic UO/sub 2/ lattice when U/sub 3/O/sub7/ was formed. At 300/sup 0/C the differences in reactivity between theindividual crystal faces became more marked, resulting in the growthof a layer of U/sub 3/O/sub 8/ on the (111) surface, cracking of the(110) surface combined with extensive U/sub 3/O/sub 8/ nucleation atcrack sites, and cracking of the (100) and polycrystalline surfaces associatedwith the continued growth of the U/sub 3/O/sub 7/ layer. Factors governingthe oxidation behaviour of different crystalline UO/sub 2/ slices arediscussed, and it is proposed that the observed reactivity reflects theease with which oxygen interstitial atoms are incorporated into the newoxide forming at the U/sub 3/O/sub 7//UO/sub 2/ interface.</TEXT></DOC>
