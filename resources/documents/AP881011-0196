All of the weapons are produced by a civilian agency, the EnergyDepartment, and always have been. No administration or Congress haswanted to give the job to the military.   It wasn't until the 1950s, in fact, that the armed forces wereeven allowed to keep weapons on hand. If they had wanted one, theywould have had to get it from the Atomic Energy Commission, one ofthe department's predecessors.   The DOE operations have recently been the focus of studies andnews reports alleging serious breaches of safety or security atseveral facilities.   The most recent major study of weapons production was publishedin 1987 by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a group bestknown for its lawsuits on behalf of environmental causes.   The study estimated that the Energy Department in 1985-1990would produce each year slightly more than 1,800 nuclear bombs,warheads, shells and other weapons in 10 different types, with 12more designs in research and development.   Through 1986, the armed services had deployed 71 differentweapons in 116 different systems. Only 29 types were still in thestockpile, and the total explosive force available had declineddrastically as new weapons incorporating improved accuracy cameinto service.   Two laboratories design the weapons, often competing with eachother, and a third designs the non-nuclear components of a bomb orwarhead.   The Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico was establishedin the greatest secrecy by the Army's Manhattan Engineer District,the fabled Manhattan Project, in 1943 to design and build the twobombs dropped on Japan in August 1945.   The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at Livermore, Calif.was established in 1952 for Edward Teller, the principal backer ofwhat was called then ``the super'' _ the hydrogen bomb.   Los Alamos, in fact, designed the first hydrogen, orthermonuclear, weapons and after a few test failures LawrenceLivermore started putting its designs into the national stockpilein 1958.   The Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M., designs thefuses, security features and new delivery systems in cooperationwith the armed services.   Recently the Energy Department has been making only two of thesix materials that have been used over the years for nuclear andthermonuclear weapons, tritium and plutonium.   The other four _ Lithium-6, uranium-235, uranium-238 anddeuterium _ are not in production for weapons, although somestockpiled weapons still incorporate uranium, and the uranium isrecycled into new weapons.   Plutonium, made from uranium in nuclear reactors, is used formodern weapons in preference to uranium, even though it's moreexpensive.   Only one-third as much plutonium is needed to form the``critical mass'' that sustains the nuclear reaction, according toThomas Cochran, principal author of the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil study. This permits a lighter, smaller bomb.   Tritium is used to boost the explosive power of nuclear weaponsand in thermonuclear weapons, all of which use a nuclear device asa trigger.   At the moment, there is no production of either plutonium ortritium.   These materials recently have come from two sites, a reactor atthe Hanford Nuclear Reservation near Richland, Wash., and threereactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C. Hanford madeplutonium and Savannah River made both plutonium and tritium.   The Feed Materials Production Center near Fernald, Ohio, and theAshtabula Plant near Ashtabula, Ohio, supply fuel assembliestoHanford and Savannah River.   These reactors start with uranium from a variety of sources,including research reactors, spent fuel from warships recovered atthe Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls;inventory accumulated over the years and uranium recycled alongwith plutonium from weapons being retired. The government hasn'tbought uranium for weapons since 1971.   Tritium is produced from lithium-6 recovered from retiredwarheads at the Mound Plant at Miamisburg, Ohio.   It is believed the three reactors at Savannah River had beenconcentrating on tritium. Energy Secretary John Herrington has toldCongress ``we're awash in plutonium.''   It takes 24,000 years for half of a given mass of plutonium todecay, but half of any amount of tritium is gone in 12.3 years. Thetritium in any weapon must be ``refreshed'' from time to time.   The Rocky Flats, Colo., plant assembles the fissionablematerials inside conventional high explosive that sets off anuclear explosion. The Y-12 plant at Oak Ridge, Tenn., castsuranium apon.The Kansas City Plant in Missouri makes fuses and other components,using electronics from Sandia.   All these various parts are sent to the Pantex plant atAmarillo, Texas, for final weapons assembly and shipment to themilitary.   This plant also disassembles warheads being taken out ofservice, modifies existing weapons and tests components forreliability and conformity with design.</TEXT></DOC>
