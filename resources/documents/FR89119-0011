The revisionsconsist of Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> emission limits and plans for Dearborn, Gibson, Lake, and PorterCounties. USEPA's actions were based upon revision requests which weresubmitted by the State to satisfy the requirements of section 110, andPart D for Lake County, of the Clean Air Act (Act).\1\<NOTE/> USEPA, today, is approving Indiana's emission limits andplans for all of these counties. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Lake County has been designated as an area which has notattained the primary national ambient air quality standards for SO<T2>2</T2> under section 107 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7407.

The SIPs for these counties currentlyconsist of the general provisions of Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> rule, 325 IAC 7-1, which USEPA approved on January 19, 1988(53 FR 1354). The proposed revisons consist of (1) the site-specific SO<T2>2</T2> emission limits and other requirements in 326 IAC 7-1-20 (DearbornCounty, submitted on November 16, 1988), 326 IAC 7-1-19 (Gibson County,submitted July 12, 1988), 326 IAC 7-1-8.1 (Lake County, submitted November16, 1988, and December 6, 1988), and 326 IAC 7-1-21 (Porter County, submittedNovember 16, 1988, and December 6, 1988), and (2) the 6.0 lbs/MMBTU emissionlimit in 326 IAC 7-1-2, which is the emission limit applicable to all othersources not specifically listed in the county-specific rules (except fornew sources subject to federally enforceable new source review permits).Background information for USEPA's rulemaking action is contained in theSeptember 6, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices and will not be repeated here. The specificemission limitations and plan requirements for these counties are alsodiscussed in the September 6, 1988, notices. USEPA today approves the emission limits and other requirements for sourcesin these counties and the overall SO<T2>2</T2> plans for these counties on the ground that they satisfy therequirements of section 110 (and as to Lake County, Part D) of the CleanAir Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Response to Public Comments </ITAG>In response to the Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRs), comments concerningLake County were submitted by: (1) Inland Steel Corp (Inland) (2) AMOCO Oil Company (AMOCO) (3) Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) (4) Marblehead Lime Co. (Marblehead). Comments concerning Gibson County were submitted by: (1) Public Service Indiana (PSI). Comments concerning Dearborn County were submitted by: (1) Joseph E. Seagram andamp; Sons Inc. (Seagram) (2) Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) (3) The Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce SO<T2>2</T2> Task Force (GCCC) (4) Cincinnati Gas andamp; Electric (CGandamp;E). The Indiana Deaprtment of Environmental Management (IDEM) also submittedcomments concerning all four counties under consideration in this notice.Requirements for Advance Notice and Additional Recordkeeping in Dearborn,Lake, and Porter Counties In the NPR for Dearborn, Lake, and Porter Counties, USEPA solicited commentsconcerning the need for advance notice prior to switching emission limitsfor certain sources which are subject to multiple emission limit scenarios.<T3>Comments: </T3>IDEM stated that although advance notification is notnecessary for enforcement purposes, the rules do require advance notificationin certain instances for convenience in enforcement. In cases where thealternative emission limits are dependent upon the fuel type and numberof units operating simultaneously, IDEM stated that advance notificationmay be impractical. Furthermore, IDEM stated that the lack of advance notificationdoes not hamper its ability to enforce the limits in force.Seagram, NIPSCO, Inland, and AMOCO believed that prior notification isnot necessary, not reasonably feasible, and is overly burdensome for theaffected sources. <T3>Response: </T3>USEPA has reviewed Dearborn, Lake, and Porter Countyrules and has determined that, for the reasons provided by IDEM, they containsufficient provisions for enforcement. Consequently, USEPA accepts theserules.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ As a general matter, USEPA prefers fixed emission limits,rather than optional limits which increase the burden of States and USEPAin assuring compliance. USEPA has determined that the rules for Dearborn,Lake, and Porter Counties are enforceable as required by the CAA. Thisapproval is based on the factual circumstances here and should not be interpretedas obliging USEPA to approve optional limits submitted by a State in othercircumstances. <ITAG tagnum="28">As always, USEPA has the authority, on a case specific basis, to usesection 114 to establish additional monitoring, recordkeeping, and reportingrequirements, as necessary, to assure compliance with these rules for Dearborn,Gibson, Lake, and Porter Counties. </ITAG>In the NPR for Dearborn, Lake, and Porter Counties, USEPA requested thatIDEM clarify: (a) The methods to be used to obtain the additional recordsand data required by the State rules for sources subject to alternativeemissions limits, and (b) whether these records and data can be used todetermine compliance. <T3>Comments: </T3>IDEM addressed these items in its comments. Concerningthe methods for obtaining data, IDEM stated that it is not necessary tospecify an additional method to determine facility operating status, fueltype, or actual heat input and that its procedures for collecting continuousemission monitoring (CEM) data are specified in the rule for the applicablesources. IDEM also maintained that the lack of a fuel sampling and analysismethod should not prevent final approval because IDEM has made a commitmentto incorporate specific methods in 326 IAC 7-1-3, because the previouslyapproved rule requires certain companies to submit compliance plans (whichwill specify the fuel sampling and analysis method), and because USEPA'shas previously approved the rules for other counties without fuel samplingand analysis requirements. IDEM also stated that records currently required by its rules are intendedto be used to determine compliance. Inland and Seagrams noted that theyare required under these rules to collect data for the State to determinecompliance. NIPSCO objected to the additional information required by theState rule. <T3>Response: </T3>USEPA is approving the rules as submitted by Indiana.USEPA accepts the State's position that the records and data, as requiredby these rules, can be used to determine compliance. USEPA acknowledgesIDEM's commitment to revise 326 IAC 7-1-3 in the near future to includefuel sampling and analysis methods. Any comment, such as NIPSCO's, concerning the State requirements for recordkeepingetc. must be raised at the State level. USEPA has determined that the rulemeets the applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act. USEPA does not havethe authority to modify the State rule in response to NIPSCO's objection.<T3>Lake County_Other Comments: </T3>IDEM noted minor errors in the NPRand provided corrections. These follow: (1) There are four boilers at AMAIZOand five boilers at AMOCO Power Station andplusmin;3; (2) the range of emissionlimits for Inland 4AC Station Boilers 401-404 cannot exceed 1.5 lbs/MMBTU.IDEM also commented that USEPA's partial listing of emission limits andother requirements in 326 IAC 7-1-8.1 could mislead the public on the rule'sscope. (AMOCO pointed out that the State rule expresses limits for somesources in terms of ``lbs/ton'' rather than ``lbs/MMBTU'' and requiresrecords of specific gravity of the fuel rather than the heating value ofthe fuel.) <T3>Response: </T3>USEPA accepts these corrections. USEPA also acknowledgesthat the partial listing in the NPR may have been confusing and, therefore,directs the reader to 326 IAC 7-1-8.1 for a complete presentation of theapplicable emission limits and other requirements for Lake County. <T3>Comment: </T3>Marblehead Lime stated that the proposed SIP revisionsconcerning its plant are not approvable for the following reasons: (1)The requirement to build five new taller stacks is unacceptable due tothe construction and additional operating costs, there are engineeringproblems with building a stack in the waters of Lake Michigan, and theproposed stack height increases are exceedingly rigorous and harsh andare a dispersion technique contrary to section 123 of the Act. (2) Themodeled violations occur at locations (over Lake Michigan) that are notrepresentative of ambient air. (3) The State's modeling contained majorerrors, e.g., it was done in the rural mode, not the urban mode, the wrongbuilding dimensions were used, receptors were modeled with an incorrectelevation, meteorological data were developed from inappropriate sites,the height of the measurements was not representative of Marblehead Lime,no model validation was done, and the modeling overpredicts 24-hour averageconcentrations as indicated by the annual calibration. Marblehead also claimed that the State regulation was improperly adoptedby the State. Marblehead further claimed that the regulation discussedat the public hearing was ``substantially different'' from the regulationpreliminarily adopted by the Board, and that such revision, it asserted,is improper without prior notice. Furthermore, Marblehead Lime also statedthat because it was deprived of meaningful technical support data, it wastherefore also deprived of its legal opportunity to comment.<T3>Response: </T3>USEPA has examined each concern of the commenter andhas concluded that the State rule for Marblehead Lime is approvable byUSEPA. Each concern is addressed below: (1) USEPA finds the requirementto build a taller stack to be acceptable under section 123 of the Act.The required stack height would not exceed the Good Engineering Practiceformula height, as prescribed under 40 CFR 51.100(i)(i). Comments relatedto economic or technological feasibility must be raised at the state levelbecause USEPA is not authorized to consider such matters in its reviewof SIPs under Section 110(a)(2).\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ See <T3>Union Electric Co. v U.S.E.P.A., </T3>427 U.S. 246 (1976). (2) USEPA has consistently maintained that air over Lake Michigan is ambient.Ambient air is that portion of the atmosphere external to buildings, towhich the general public has access. Thus, according to 40 CFR 50.1(e),ambient air is defined in terms of public access, not frequency of access,length of stay or other factors. The only specified exception to this definitionis the atmosphere over land owned by a source and to which access is precludedby a fence or other physical barriers. Thus USEPA concludes that the airover Lake Michigan is ambient air. (3) USEPA does not find that the modeling issues raised in the commentsare errors. IDEM properly used the urban mode of ISC for the Lake CountySIP as required by the ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised),'' whichstates: ``For analysis of whole urban complexes, the entire area shouldbe modeled as an urban region if most of the sources are located in areasclassified as urban.'' USEPA finds that acceptable input data were used in running the model.The meteorological data base was developed using the most recent complete,representative data for Lake County sources. The primary data site consistedof measurements from the 91 m level on the nearby Hammond Tower. The 91m height is representative of the emission-weighted average stack heightfor the county. Substitutions for missing values were made using data fromother nearby representative sites. The assumption of a uniform receptorand stack base elevation in the modeling, although not met at every point,is generally consistent with the flat terrain throughout the study area.The building dimensions used by IDEM were apparently provided by MarbleheadLime initially and no data such as plots plans have been provided to refutethe accuracy of these dimensions. Concerning model validation, USEPA recognizes that air quality measurementscan be useful in assessing the accuracy of mathematical models, but maintainsthat it is not necessary to validate all models at all sites. Model calibrationmay be appropriate for improving the accuracy of estimated concentrations,but only for annual average concentrations. Short-term model calibrationtends to be unreliable due to uncertainties in concurrent source and meteorologicaldata. The results of an annual calibration cannot be used to infer theaccuracy of the model to predict short-term concentrations; that determinationcan only be made using short term data. Marblehead submitted no monitoringdata to refute the accuracy of the State's modeling. Finally, USEPA accepts the State's determination that the regulations wereproperly adopted. In a letter dated November 23, 1988, IDEM stated thatthe Lake County rule was adopted and promulgated in full compliance withthe Indiana Code. The legality and form of the final was approved by theIndiana Attorney General. IDEM stated that the required 21-day notice forpublic hearing was met,\4\<NOTE/> that it informed Marblehead Lime concerning its intentionto recommend rule revisions prior to and at the public hearing of May 1988,that it worked with Marblehead Lime prior to and during the rulemakingprocess to explore alternative control strategies, and that the publiccomment period was extended until July 1988 to allow the public to commenton the rule revisions. IDEM has stated its commitment to work with MarbleheadLime and, if necessary, to submit a SIP revision to USEPA for this source.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ IDEM also met the requirements of 40 CFR 51.102 that 30days notice be given prior to promulgation.USEPA has determined that the State's procedures in this case were reasonable,particularly in light of the deference which is accorded the State in interpretingthe procedural aspects of its air pollution laws, so long as the interpretationis consistent with the Act.\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ See, e.g. <T3>Florida Power and Light Company v. Costle, </T3>650 F.2d 579 (5th Cir.1981). Gibson County<T3>Comment: </T3>IDEM agreed with USEPA's statement in the NPR that anyfuture modeling, including modeling performed pursuant to PSI's complianceplan, must comply with the USEPA modeling guidelines in effect at thattime. PSI, however, objected to this position for two reasons: First, PSIcited a state background document for Gibson County which stated that thecompliance plan may be equivalent for each set of alternative emissionlimits. PSI claimed that, for equivalency, the same model must be usedsince a new model may produce more stringent alternative emission limits.Second, PSI asserted that if a model is currently sufficient to demonstrateattainment, then it should be adequate for all future regulatory analysis.<T3>Response: </T3>USEPA maintains that the modeling analysis acceptedfor this rulemaking action will not necessarily be accepted for any futurerulemaking actions, including consideration of revised emission limitationsdeveloped pursuant to PSI's compliance plan. These must be supported withmodeling performed in accordance with USEPA modeling guidelines in effectat that time. The modeling requirements may change due to advances in thescience and resulting improvement in available techniques. <T3>Comment: </T3>PSI requested that USEPA note in its final approval thatthe compliance plan will automatically be included in the SIP, upon submittalby IDEM, without further notice. <T3>Response: </T3>Neither the State rule, nor the USEPA proposed rulemaking,provides that the compliance plan shall automatically be incorporated intothe SIP. The rule specifically states that the compliance plan shall besubmitted to USEPA as a revision to the Indiana SIP. Before this revisioncan become part of the SIP, the requirements of 40 CFR Part 51, SubpartF must be satisfied. <T3>Comment: </T3>In the NPR, USEPA stated that Unit 5 at the Gibson Stationcurrently has a federally enforceable PSD emission limit. PSI claimed thatthis was not true because (1) the permit for Unit 5 was never acted uponby USEPA, (2) State law prohibits the State from issuing permits for periodslonger than 5 years, and (3) the State PSD construction permit was supercededby a State operating permit on August 20, 1982. <T3>Response: </T3>The emission limits and related items in the federalPSD permit are federally enforceable.\6\<NOTE/> Acting pursuant to EPA's delegation of PSD authority on July25, 1977, Indiana issued a permit on March 17, 1977, which, for state purposes,authorized the construction of Unit 5, but which, for federal purposes,established emission limits and related terms as required by the PSD provisionsof the Act. The federal PSD permit became effective upon its issuance bythe state and was not superceded by the state's operating permit, whichcontains the same emission limits set forth in the construction permit.The provisions of State law cited by PSI do not prohibit the State fromacting as USEPA's agent in issuing permits under federal PSD regulations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ See 40 CFR 52.21(b)(17) for the definition of ``federallyenforceable.''<T3>Comment: </T3>PSI claimed that the compliance methodology containedin 326 IAC 7-1-3 does not become federally enforceable in a given countyuntil such time as the SIP for that county is approved.<T3>Response: </T3>On January 19, 1988, USEPA approved 326 IAC 7-1-3 forall counties (53 FR 1354). Thus, contrary to the comment, 326 IAC 7-1-3is already included in the Indiana SIP statewide, and specifically in theGibson County SIP.<T3>Comment: </T3>PSI supported approval of the State's compliance schedule.PSI claimed that the State's documentation demonstrated that the scheduleis reasonably expeditious.<T3>Response: </T3>USEPA stated in the NPR that the primary and secondaryNAAQS compliance dates are consistent with the requirements of section110 of the Act and with 40 CFR 51.110. USEPA received no adverse commentsand maintains this position.<T3>Comment: </T3>IDEM noted that, on July 12, 1988, it had submitted theState promulgated rule for Gibson County, which became effective on May13, 1988.Dearborn County<T3>Comment: </T3>GCCC requested a 30-day extension of the comment period.Alternatively GCCC requested written assurance that the Dearborn Countyrulemaking would have no effect on the rulemaking for Hamilton County,Ohio, that the Dearborn County rulemaking would not make any determinationsapplicable to Hamilton County, and that USEPA has made no decision concerningwhether to issue a SIP call for Hamilton County. If this written assurancewere not given, then GCCC would object to denial of its request for extensionfor several reasons. GCCC withdrew its request for extension upon receivinga written assurance that, for the reasons set out below, this rulemakingconcerns the Dearborn County SIP, and does not bind USEPA to require aSIP revision for Hamilton County, Ohio.<T3>Response: </T3>USEPA is currently under court order to take final rulemakingaction on the Dearborn County SO<T2>2</T2> plan by December 30, 1988 <T3>(Sierra Club v. Thomas, </T3>S.D. Ind. NA 194-C (October 26, 1987)).The comment period expired on October 6, 1988. Extending the comment periodby an additional 30 days would have jeopardized the ability of USEPA tomeet the terms of the court order. Because USEPA has satisfied the requirementsof the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 <T3>et seq., </T3>USEPA believes that the 30-day public comment periodallowed the public the opportunity to participate and comment meaningfullyon this action.<T3>Comment: </T3>CGandamp;E expressed concern over USEPA's inaction on theOhio Environmental Protection Agency's (OEPA) November 1987 SIP revisionsubmittal for the Cincinnati Gas and Electric's Miami Fort plant. CGandamp;Easserted that this revision is approvable (based on the previously approvedSIP modeling and the need to discount only the amount of excess stack heightcredit), and that USEPA's inaction on the Miami Fort revision and actionon the subsequent Dearborn County submittal should not affect the acceptabilityof the Miami Fort revision. CGandamp;E urged USEPA to approve the SIP revisionfor Miami Fort or to state explicitly that Dearborn County final actiondoes not establish any finding or conclusion applicable to Hamilton County.<T3>Response: </T3>Comments on SIP submittals by the State of Ohio arenot relevant to this rulemaking on a SIP for Indiana. USEPA will respondto these comments when and if they are submitted in the context of a rulemakingon the Ohio SIP.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ OEPA's November 1987 submittal consisted of a proposedrule developed pursuant to the requirements of USEPA's July 8, 1985, StackHeight Rule relating to Miami Fort. Although OEPA requested USEPA to parallelprocess this proposed revision, USEPA informed OEPA on December 19, 1987,that the revision was incomplete. USEPA does not intend to initiate rulemakingon Miami Fort until the State has completed its submittal. USEPA is proceedingwith rulemaking on Dearborn County and will address with the Hamilton CountySIP in a separate action.<T3>Comment: </T3>OEPA stated that the Dearborn County rulemaking shouldnot affect the Hamilton County, Ohio SIP. OEPA and the GCCC noted thatthey were proceeding on a program to review the Hamilton County SIP andany action on Hamilton County should await completion of this study. Thecommenters stated that if Indiana believes that Ohio sources are interferingwith attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS in Indiana, then Indiana hasthe option of petitioning under section 126 of the Clean Air Act; thisrulemaking is not the proper means of allocating emissions among neighboringstates.<T3>Response: </T3>USEPA's approval for Dearborn County's revised SIP isbased on its acceptance of IDEM's air quality modeling showing that theemissions from Dearborn County sources under the revised rule would notcause violations of the NAAQS in Indiana or elsewhere; and also, that anynonattainment of the SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS in Dearborn County, following implementation of this revisedrule, would be attributable to emissions from Hamilton County. However,these factual judgments which are made for the purpose of taking finalaction on this Indiana SIP revision, do not bind the Agency to requirea SIP revision for Hamilton County nor do they govern the Agency's reviewof any such SIP revision for that Ohio County.In this rulemaking, USEPA is not allocating SO<T2>2</T2> emissions between Ohio and Indiana. This rulemaking only concernsIndiana's obligation to reduce Dearborn County sources' emission as necessaryboth to attain the NAAQS in Indiana and to avoid contributing to NAAQSviolations elsewhere. USEPA has not received a section 126 petition relevantto this proceeding and thus does not respond to the commenter's suggestionthat such a petition would be an appropriate means to allocate SO<T2>2</T2> emissions between Ohio and Indiana.<T3>Comment: </T3>GCCC claimed that the Dearborn County modeling does notjustify reopening the Hamilton County SIP. GCCC and OEPA claimed that currentHamilton County SIP limits are adequate because: (1) There have been nomonitored violations in Hamilton County, (2) the limits were developedconsistent with the Modeling Guidelines in effect at the time and approvedby USEPA, (3) the CRSTER modeling used was upheld by the U.S. Court ofAppeals for the Sixth Circuit, (4) CRSTER has been shown to be conservativefor receptors near stack top, which is the case in western Hamilton County,and (5) CRSTER has been validated, while IDEM's modeling techniques havenot been.Additional problems raised by the GCCC with regard to IDEM's modeling include:(6) The screening complex terrain model results are too crude for regulatorypurposes because the model is deliberately designed to overestimate concentrations,(7) ISC with downwash was not developed and has not been validated forcircumstances similar to those in Hamilton County (i.e., the model shouldbe restricted to flat terrain and neutral/slightly unstable conditions),and (8) a model comparison study performed by OEPA shows that the concentrationspredicted by ISC with downwash are more than double the concentrationspredicted by CRSTER or ISC without downwash. GCCC also requested USEPAto include in the record of this rulemaking a copy of the ISC User's Manualand a description of the physical situations under which the downwash algorithmwas developed and validated. <T3>Response:</T3> These comments address the validity of IDEM's modelingif used for the purpose of determining the adequacy of the Hamilton County,Ohio SIP. The comments fail to address the <T3>only </T3>subject of this proceeding, namely, whether the SIP revisionsubmittal for Dearborn County, Indiana, satisfies the requirements of theAct. In this notice USEPA will respond to these comments only to the verylimited extent that they may be interpreted to concern the appropriatenessof USEPA's approval of the Dearborn County SIP revision. USEPA accepts IDEM's modeling for the purpose of supporting the DearbornCounty SIP. According to the Modeling Guidelines, the model that most accuratelyestimates concentrations in the area of interest should be used. By recommendingthe use of certain air quality models, the Guidelines create a presumptionof reliability and accuracy. For sources located in complex terrain, andfor complicated sources with special problems, such as building downwash,and such as those in Dearborn County, the guidelines recommend the useof VALLEY (or Complex run in the VALLEY mode) or the Industrial SourceComplex (ISC) model. CRSTER is not appropriate here because it does addresscomplex terrain or building downwash; the cases cited by the commenterdo not indicate that USEPA should use CRSTER here. IDEM has used the Guidelinemodel in this situation. Thus, USEPA believes that IDEM's modeling is bothconsistent with the Guidelines and provides reliable concentration estimates.<T3>Comment: </T3>The GCCC urged USEPA to develop a more reasonable technicalbasis for approving the Dearborn County SIP. Alternatively, the commenterurged USEPA to either delay final rulemaking on Dearborn County until completionof the Hamilton County study or state in the final notice that the ``** * Indiana modeling does not apply, establish facts, or create presumptionsor conclusions as to any Clean Air Act requirements beyond the Indianaborder.'' <T3>Response: </T3>IDEM's modeling analysis is consistent with USEPA'sModeling Guidelines. This model has been demonstrated to provide reliableconcentration estimates in circumstances such as those relevant to thisproceeding. No actual data refuting the accuracy of these models have beenprovided by the commenters. Thus, USEPA accepts IDEM's modeling for DearbornCounty. Any determinations concerning the applicability of IDEM's modeling``beyond the Indiana border'' will be made on a case-by-case basis. Suchmatters are beyond the scope of this rulemaking action. <T3>Comments: </T3>IDEM asserted that USEPA is obligated to issue a noticeof SIP deficiency to Ohio on the basis of IDEM's modeling. IDEM statedthat Ohio should be required to submit a revised SIP within one year andto follow current modeling guidelines. IDEM cited its history of havingto deal with SIP calls, Section 126 petitions, SIP revisions, potentialenforcement actions, lawsuits, and revocation of its SO<T2>2</T2> enforcement policy. IDEM questioned USEPA's willingness to implementthe Act in cases where Indiana's air quality is jeopardized by anotherState. <T3>Response: </T3>USEPA wishes to emphasize that its rulemaking on DearbornCounty is not dependent on the issuance of a SIP call for Hamilton County;the two actions are separate. Approval of the Dearborn County plan is basedonly on USEPA's determination that this part of the Indiana SIP is consistentwith the requirements of section 110 of Act. Action on the Hamilton CountySIP will occur through USEPA's implementation of the Act there. <T3>Comment: </T3>The GCCC argued that USEPA's rulemaking may be a ``major''action under Executive Order No. 12291 because it appears to affect morethan Dearborn County. If, however, USEPA explicitly disclaims any effecton Hamilton County, then the commenter would be willing to accept the findingthat this is not a major action. <T3>Response: </T3>This rulemaking applies only to Dearborn, Gibson, Lake,and Porter Counties and is not a major action, because it merely approves,for Federal purposes, Indiana State rules. USEPA will make a determinationas to whether a SIP for Hamilton County is a ``major action'' under ExecutiveOrder 12291 at the time it rulemakes on a plan for that county. <T3>Comment: </T3>IDEM and Seagram noted a few errors in the September6, 1988 <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice and offered corrections (i.e., final compliancedate for Dearborn County sources is the effective date of the rule forall sources, except Tanners Creek Unit 4, for which it is August 1, 1991;name of company is ``Joseph E. Seagram andamp; Sons, Inc.''; the word ``burning''is misspelled).<T3>Response: </T3>USEPA accepts these corrections.Porter County <T3>Comment: </T3>IDEM noted that clerical errors identified by USEPA inthe NPR have been corrected. <T3>Response: </T3>USEPA acknowledges this. <T3>Comment: </T3>IDEM stated that the emission limitations in 326 IAC7-1-21 were shown to protect the 3-hour NAAQS based on both urban and ruralmodeling. <T3>Response: </T3>USEPA's proposed approval of Porter County plan wasbased on the State's rural modeling analysis. Although USEPA is aware thatIDEM also performed urban modeling here, USEPA believes that the ruralmodeling has been shown to be consistent with USEPA modeling guidelinesand, thus, has chosen to rely on it in this rulemaking.Miscellaneous: Recodification of Indiana Rules In addition to taking final action to approve the SIP submittals for Dearborn,Gibson, Lake and Porter Counties, USEPA today is amending 40 CFR Part 52to reflect the State of Indiana's recodification of various rules thatUSEPA previously approved: specifically, 326 IAC 7-1-1 through 7-1-7; andthe county-specific rules for Jefferson, LaPorte, Marion, Sullivan, Warrick,and Wayne Counties. In prior <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices, USEPA approved these rules, which hadbeen submitted as part of 325 IAC. The State of Indiana subsequently recodifiedthose rules as part of 326 IAC. No substantive changes have been made inthese rules following USEPA's approvals.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ In USEPA's proposed approval of all of Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> rules, the possibility of a recodification was referenced. USEPAstated that all rules would be codified under Title 326, instead of Title325, when and if they were submitted as such. In keeping with this statment,USEPA is approving Indiana's recodification of its SO<T2>2</T2> rules today.Conclusion USEPA is approving Indiana's emission limits, other requirements, and overallplans for Dearborn, Gibson, Lake, and Porter Counties, because they meetthe requirements of section 110 (and for Lake, Part D) of the Act. TheOffice of Management and Budget has exempted these rules from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial reviewof this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals forthe appropriate circuit by March 20, 1989. This action may not be challengedlater in proceedings to enforce its requirements.
