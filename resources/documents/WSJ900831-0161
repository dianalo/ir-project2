Most U.S. manufacturers still adhere to the traditionalposition of rigorously protecting American companies fromimports that are &quot;dumped&quot; -- that is, sold at less than theirassumed costs. But U.S. multinational companies areincreasingly interested in weakening the anti-dumping rules,and thus are allying themselves with trading competitors ofthe U.S., such as Japan and South Korea.</LP><TEXT>   Leading the drive to water down the anti-dumping rules aregiant companies such as International Business MachinesCorp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Caterpillar Inc. and Cargill Inc.Many of these multinationals rely heavily on foreigncomponents or raw materials; strict enforcement of currentanti-dumping rules raises the costs of these imports.   Moreover, these companies have become large exporters andthus are vulnerable to other nations' anti-dumping actions.Donald Fites, Caterpillar's president and chairman-elect,contends that unless the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade, the group that sets rules for world trade, acts toprevent what he sees as abuses of the anti-dumping code, suchactions could become &quot;the protectionist weapon of choice inthe 1990s.&quot;   On the other side are many U.S. industries -- such assteel, automotive, ball-bearings, glass and textiles -- thathave been the victims of dumping. They are pressing theadministration to seek a toughening of the rules, or at leastto get the GATT negotiators to leave them alone.   These proponents of strong anti-dumping laws also claimconsiderable clout in Congress. Caucus leaders claiming torepresent as many as 300 House votes have warned PresidentBush that they will oppose any agreement that &quot;substantiallyweakens&quot; the anti-dumping laws.   The conflicting demands could hurt the Bushadministration's ability to win quick congressional approvalfor a new accord under GATT, which it hopes to send toCapitol Hill next year.   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who believes the U.S.anti-dumping law is the only shield some industries haveagainst predatory imports, vows that the U.S. won't accept acode that &quot;diminishes the rights and remedies available toU.S. firms.&quot;   But U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills has overallresponsibility for coordinating the U.S. position in thecurrent round of GATT negotiations. As it draws to aconclusion in December, she will be trying to bundle all theGATT issues into a single package that the U.S. and more than100 other nations can agree on. At that point, advocates of astrong anti-dumping code worry, Mrs. Hills may give up partof the U.S. position on dumping in order to gain importanttrade benefits in other areas.   &quot;Some countries will whisper, give us some changes in theanti-dumping code if you want an agreement in agriculture,services and investments,&quot; says Alan Wolff, trade counsel forthe Semiconductor Industry Association.   Making matters even more worrisome for Mr. Wolff and hisclients is the new congruity of interests between some U.S.multinationals and trade adversaries such as Japan and SouthKorea. Like the multinationals, the Japanese want the newGATT code to accept the practice of &quot;forward-pricing,&quot; orspreading capital and research costs over the entireprojected life of a product, allowing exporters to shipproducts at less than their current costs. This would reversethe current U.S. practice.   Japan, Canada and the U.S. multinationals also are jointlypressing the Bush administration to accept a &quot;sunset&quot;provision in the GATT code, which would require membercountries to terminate anti-dumping duties after a specificperiod of time. The European Community already has afive-year sunset provision, but under current U.S. practice,anti-dumping orders remain in effect until it can be shownthat the goods in question have been landed at non-dumpedprices for three consecutive years.   There are obvious reasons for this unanimity of viewsbetween major U.S. exporters and Japan. Until the mid-1980s,only the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the European Communityhad active anti-dumping programs. Now at least 27 countrieshave adopted similar laws, including Argentina, Brazil,Mexico and Chile.   As a result, U.S. companies are finding themselves on thereceiving end of anti-dumping actions. Mexico alone hasdirected at least 15 against them since 1987, according tothe International Trade Commission. &quot;The U.S. now ranks upthere with Japan as the leading targets of anti-dumpingactions,&quot; says Gary Horlick, a trade lawyer advising IBM,Caterpillar and other multinationals.   The Commerce Department is resisting the pressure tochange. Eric Garfinkel, the department's assistant secretaryfor import administration, acknowledges that the U.S. and theEuropean Community are practically the only two parties inGATT that oppose weakening the code.   ---                 The U.S. and Japan As Targets                                                                                                          Anti-dumping investigations launched between 1980 and June1988                                                                                                                                          AGAINST     AGAINST COUNTRY             TOTAL           JAPAN        U.S.                                                                                                        Australia             465              47          52 U.S.                  409              62         --- European Community    357              31          23 Canada                319              25          55 Argentina              43               4           6 Mexico                 30               2          14 New Zealand            17               2         --- South Korea             6               4         --- Others                 19             ---         ---                                                                                                        Totals              1,665             177         150                                                                                                          Source: &quot;Anti-Dumping Law and Practice,&quot; ed. by John H.Jackson and Edwin A.
