(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   International Golf Inc. profits byothers' mistakes.   Slices, hooks, duffs or sinkers _ whatever golfers call theirmisdirected shots _ the sound of balls plopping into water hazardsis sweet music at the world's largest distributor of used golf balls.   Riding the sport's surge in popularity this decade, InternationalGolf scuba divers are expected to retrieve 10 million golf ballsthis year for redistribution everywhere from golf-crazy Japan to thehills of Scotland, birthplace of the game 800 years ago.   The number of balls rolling into the plant is five times morethan the company processed in 1985 and more than all gathered by itsfew competitors, says the concern's president, Jerry Gunderson.   ``When you think of all the golf courses and all the peoplehitting balls into ponds, we have no idea how far this could go,''said Gunderson.   The company is now straining the limits of its plant anddirectors are discussing a first-time public stock offering to helppay for expansion.   ``Think about it, every golfer loses balls and they could have apiece of a company that makes money getting them out,'' saidGunderson. ``They'd say, `Well, I lost $100 in balls, but maybe I'llget some of it back.'''   The recent success of International Golf sometimes bogglesGunderson, whose first boyhood job was making 8 cents a ball combingwater traps in nearby Lake Worth. He later spent $1,500 of collegetuition money from his father on scuba gear and devised a weekendcircuit to collect balls in Jacksonville, Atlanta and St. Petersburg.   Fraternity brothers seeking a piece of his profits would face aunique job interview.   ``I'd put them under a freezing cold shower for 10 minutes,'' hesaid. ``Not many of them made it.''   Gunderson returned to his father's furniture business followingcollege, but the entrepreneurial urge was too strong. Through the'60s and '70s he launched several golf-related retail enterprises.Each time business foundered, he turned to golf ball collecting tobail himself out.   The break came last year when Merimac Investment Inc., a FortWorth, Texas-based venture capital firm, started to bankroll thecompany and brought in consultants to overhaul management. Now,International Golf pays more than $500,000 a year for the rights tocollect balls at about 600 U.S. courses.   Meanwhile, golf is taking off like a solid tee shot. TheFlorida-based National Golf Foundation, a trade group, says 23.4million people played at least one round of golf last year, up from15.1 million in 1980.   More than 320 new courses have opened since 1987 in the UnitedStates, bringing the total to more than 13,000. In Japan, there arean estimated 12 million golfers and 1,600 courses.   International Golf does not release sales figures, but Gundersonsaid it's now a multimillion-dollar operation that ships ballsthroughout the United States, Europe and many countries in Asia. Ittakes about 3.5 million balls to break even, he said.   The backbone of the company is its 45 divers, who earn between$500 and $1,000 a week plunging into the murky and debris-cloggedwater traps. Broken glass and rubbish are just some of the hazardsfacing divers as they grope along the bottom in silt up to four feetdeep. Alligators have also bitten at least two divers.   ``There is no glamour to this job,'' said diver Theron McBride,whose flipper was once pulled off by an alligator. ``There is zerovisibility and I've run into everything down there: rakes, dumptrucks, golf carts and shopping carts. It's kind of like catchingbubbles in the dark.''   On a good day, a diver can pull up 600 balls. They are thenshipped by truck to the plant.   Gunderson's modest office is decorated with a few golf postersand a sail fish he caught as a teen-ager. The arm rests of hisswivel chair are torn.   The view is the barb wire-ringed courtyard, where 1.5 millionballs are bagged and waiting to go through the assembly line.   First, the balls are washed and immersed in chemicals to removealgae and barnacles. Next, they are inspected for quality andimperfections. Cuts are surprisingly few due to the high-impactSurlyn jackets on most new balls.   The highest grade balls are packaged and sold for about half theprice of manufacturers' new balls. The lesser quality balls arerepainted and sent to driving ranges. Even those with cuts are sentto luxury cruise ships to be blasted into the sea from decksidedriving ranges.   ``I'm having a wonderful time,'' said Gunderson. ``We were allworking so hard we never looked up to see how things were going.Then one day I looked at them loading pallets to be shipped toEurope _ France, England, Sweden and Spain _ and I thought, `I usedto pick up balls with my toes.' It's pretty amazing.''   Gunderson says his company is still a relatively minor player inthe $462 million-a-year golf ball market, but while other companieshave their eyes on the green, International Golf is left along toscour the ponds.   ``We're not one-to-one competitors with the big guys yet,'' saidGunderson, ``but at least we're one of their little headaches.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday AMs, July 17</NOTE></DOC>
