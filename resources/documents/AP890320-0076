RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal byworkers at a California nuclear power plant who are challengingtheir employer's random drug tests.   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that threw out,at least temporarily, a lawsuit attacking the tests.   The justices already are studying the validity of drug tests inthree other cases, one involving a private employer and twoconcerning federal workers or federal regulations.   The case acted on today stems from tests initiated by SouthernCalifornia Edison Co. at its San Onofre nuclear plant.   The tests, modified in December 1986, require randomly selectedworkers to produce urine samples for laboratory analysis. Theworkers are told the day before they are tested.   The plan was challenged by Local 246 of the Utility Workers Unionof America.   The union said the tests violate the collective bargainingagreement between the workers and the utility, and also violateprovisions of the California Constitution protecting privacy andfreedom from unreasonable searches and seizure.   The union's lawsuit was filed in state court and transferred to afederal court at the request of Southern California Edison.   A federal judge in 1987 temporarily blocked the tests pendingresolution of a grievance filed by the union.   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the judge'sinjunction, and also ruled that the lawsuit was preempted by federallabor law.   The appeals court said the federal Labor Management Relations Actgoverning worker-employer disputes bars the nuclear plant workersfrom filing a suit now claiming their rights guaranteed by theCalifornia Constitution were violated.   ``Drug testing does not implicate the sort of non-negotiablestate-law rights'' that would allow the suit to be decided in courtbefore it is determined whether the tests violate the workers'collective bargaining agreement, the appeals court said.   The appeals court said the next step for the union is to submitthe case to arbitration to decide whether the contract was violatedbecause the utility unilaterally adopted the tests.   The appeals court did not rule out the possibility that Local 246could return to the courts if it loses in arbitration.   The union said it should be entitled now to a ruling on whetherthe California Constitution protects workers against random drugtests.   The case is Utility Workers Union vs. Southern California Edison,88-1180.</TEXT></DOC>
