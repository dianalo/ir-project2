Taylor and Karen Blumenthal (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><TEXT>   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board provided an estimated $2 billion in assistance to merge four failing Texas savings institutions, holding $4 billion in assets, into Dallas-based Southwest Savings Association.    None of the assistance, a record amount for the Bank Board in a merger case, was in the form of cash. The board said it is providing Southwest Savings a note for $483 million, and income and capital guarantees valued at more than $1.5 billion to cover bad assets. In return, the agency will acquire rights to half of Southwest Savings' common stock, and it will receive preferred stock valued at 90% of the merged thrift's first $60 million in profits following the merger.    Bank Board Member Lawrence White said the merger is &quot;the most cost efficient and effective plan to consolidate the operations of these thrifts in a manner that ensures a viable future.&quot;    But Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., thrift consultant, charged that the merger failed to put the institutions back on a solid footing in the private sector. The troubled thrifts, he said, &quot;are still wards of the federal government.&quot;    Southwest didn't bring any new capital to the merger, aside from converting $25 million in subordinated debt to equity. The only previous assisted Texas-thrift merger this year brought in just $3.5 million in new, private-sector capital. But George Barclay, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, said he expects &quot;significant amounts of outside capital&quot; to be contributed to future deals.    Critics of the merger noted that Southwest Savings goes into it with a weak capital base. Officials at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas said the thrift had net worth (assets minus liabilities), using regulatory accounting principles, of $27.6 million. That's less than 1.9% of its $1.48 billion asset base. Sandamp;Ls are supposed to be building capital to 6% of their assets.    A group of respected banking economists and lawyers, the Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee, warned this week that the Bank Board's shaky Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. risks greater long-term losses from merging failed thrifts into weak ones.    Some executives at other savings institutions were concerned that the merger agreement clears Southwest Savings to use its FSLIC note and $2.6 billion in assets covered by FSLIC guarantees as collateral for loans from the Dallas home loan bank. With the FSLIC short of money, &quot;they're leveraging the bank system,&quot; complained one industry official.    The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the largest thrift industry group, has formally opposed securing home loan bank advances with FSLIC notes or guarantees. Already, the Dallas bank has been unable to obtain an opinion from its accountants for its 1987 financial statement, because of questions about FSLIC guarantees securing roughly $500 million of its loans.    Sandamp;Ls, which own the home loan banks, fear that doubts about the FSLIC's ability to pay will undermine the credit of the home loan banks and drive up their cost of debt.    The merger announcement came as the Senate Banking Committee prepared for a hearing today, at which Congress's General Accounting Office and others are expected to voice new concerns about the deteriorating condition of FSLIC and the Sandamp;L industry.    In the latest merger, Southwest Savings will acquire the following institutions: Lamar Savings Association, Austin, with $1.9 billion in assets; Briercroft Savings Association, Austin, $868 million; City Savings andamp; Loan Association, San Angelo, $687 million; and Stockton Savings Association, Dallas, $543 million. Officials at the Dallas home loan bank said the four had negative net worth of $924 million, by regulatory accounting, and ran operating losses of $84 million in the first quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
