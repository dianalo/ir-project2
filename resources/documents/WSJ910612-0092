However, after thecontract expires, the Zuckers will be free to sign up withanother major studio or remain free agents, producing moviesat various studios.</LP><TEXT>   Paramount declined to comment on the contract talks, and aspokesman for Creative Artists Agency, which represents theZuckers, said the agency could only confirm that the contractwould not be renewed. The Zuckers couldn't be reached.   But people familiar with the negotiations said Paramountdeclined to meet considerably richer terms being demanded bythe Zuckers, among the more respected and versatile youngteams in Hollywood. In some films, such as &quot;Airplane],&quot; theywrote, produced and directed; in others, such as &quot;Ghost,&quot;Jerry Zucker directed a screenplay that turned into ablockbuster hit.   However, despite the long and lucrative relationship withthe Zuckers, Paramount, like a number of major studios inHollywood, has been attempting to scale back skyrocketingcosts of production and talent -- and exclusive deals aretypically among the most expensive. The Zuckers started atParamount in the early 1980s, then left to go to Walt DisneyCo., producing the hit &quot;Ruthless People.&quot; Unhappy when Disneywouldn't give them a more lucrative deal on their next film,they were wooed back to Paramount by former chairman FrankMancuso.</TEXT></DOC>
