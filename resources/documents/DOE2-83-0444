This process is of considerableimportance as it provides the dominant transport mechanism in a stellaratorplasma at low collision frequency; that is, when the frequency with whicha particle is collisionally detrapped from a local ripple well is lessthan the bounce frequency of the particle in that well. A form of thelongitudinal adiabatic invariant, J, is constructed and shown to describeaccurately the orbits of ripple-trapped particles. Unlike previous expressionsfor J, the form derived here correctly accounts for the local toroidalvariation in the magnetic field. The expression for J is incorporatedinto a rapid hybrid Monte Carlo simulation of ripple transport in stellarators.The simulation is a hybrid in the sense that particle orbits in the narrowregion of phase space on either side of the ripple trapping/detrappingboundary are followed using guiding center equations of motion whileorbits in the remainder of phase space are described using adiabaticinvariants.</TEXT></DOC>
