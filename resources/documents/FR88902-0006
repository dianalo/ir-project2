This administrative action is governed by the provisions of sections 556and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code and therefore is excludedfrom the requirements of Executive Order 12291 and Departmental Regulation1512-1.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Statement  </ITAG>This final rule was formulated on the record of a public hearing held June10-12, 1986, at Visalia, California to consider the proposed further amendmentsof Marketing Order No. 907 [7 CFR Part 907] regulating the handling ofnavel oranges grown in Arizona and designated part of California and MarketingOrder No. 908 [7 CFR Part 908] regulating the handling of Valencia orangesgrown in Arizona and designated part of California, hereinafter referredto collectively as the ``orders.'' The hearing was held pursuant to theprovisions of the agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended[7 U.S.C. 601-674 <T3>et seq.</T3>], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act,'' and the applicablerules of practice and procedure governing proceedings to formulate marketingagreements and marketing order [7 CFR Part 900]. The Notice of Hearingcontained amendment proposals submitted by: The Sequoia Orange Company,Inc.; R. E. Herrick of Belridge Farms and Packing Company; the Navel andValencia Orange Administrative Committees established under the orders,hereinafter referred to collectively as the ``committees,'' and the Fruitand Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture. The proposals pertained to committee size and composition,a limitation on tenure for members of the Valencia Orange AdministrativeCommittee, changing the basis for industry representation on the committees,inclusion of a definition of ``Capper-Volstead'' cooperatives in the orders,use of the total volume of all oranges in all outlets in determining nominatingrights, and conforming changes.  Upon the basis of evidence introduced at the hearing and the record thereof,the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), on June1, 1987, filed with the Hearing Clerk, U.S. Department of Agriculture,a Recommended Decision containing a notice of the opportunity to file writtenexceptions thereto by July 8, 1987. Eleven exceptions were filed, and werediscussed and ruled upon in the Secretary's Decision.  The Secretary's Decision was issued June 6, 1988, directing that referendabe conducted during the period June 21 through July 8, 1988, among producersof navel and Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated parts ofCalifornia to determine whether they favored various amendment proposalsto the orders. In those referenda, navel orange producers voted in favorof three of the four amendment proposals listed on the referendum ballot,and Valencia orange producers voted for four of the five amendment proposalslisted on the referendum ballot. The proposal that did not receive therequisite approval by three-fourths by number of either navel or Valenciaorange producers or two-thirds by volume of such production would haveauthorized an increase in committee size up to 13 members. Accordingly,those proposed amendments are not included in these orders amending theorders and modifications have been made to the proposed marketing ordersamending the orders as appropriate to reflect this change. In addition,language inadvertently omitted from andSection;907.27 in publication of theproposed amendments in the Secretary's Decision is included in the order. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) [5 U.S.C. 601-612], theAdministrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has determined thatthis action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. As stated in the Notice of Hearing, interestedpersons were invited to present evidence at the hearing on the probableregulatory and informational impact of the amendment proposals on smallbusiness for purposes of the RFA. In that regard, such evidence was consideredin arriving at the findings and conclusions contained in the RecommendedDecision and in the Secretary's Decision. Those findings and conclusionsare incorporated herein.     There are approximately 125 handlers of navel oranges and 115 handlersof Valencia oranges subject to regulation under their respective orders,and approximately 4,065 producers of navel oranges and 3,500 producersof Valencia oranges in California and Arizona. Given the applicable definitionof a small business concern (i.e., for purposes of review pursuant to theRFA, an agricultural services firm with average annual receipts not exceeding$3,500,000), almost all of the handlers of navel and Valencia oranges wouldfall within that definition. Small agricultural producers have been definedby the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.2] as those having averagegross annual revenues for the last three fiscal years of less than $500,000.The majority of California-Arizona navel and Valenica orange producersand handlers may be classified as small entities.The collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980[44 U.S.C. Chapter 35] contained in these orders amending orders has beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (Approval Nos. 0581-0116and 0581-0121).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Parts 907 and 908</ITAG>Arizona, California, Marketing orders and agreements, Navel, Oranges, andValencia.<ITAG tagnum="85">Order Amending the Orders_Regulating the Handling of Navel and ValenciaOranges Grown in Arizona and Designated Parts of California</ITAG>Findingsand determinationsThe findings and determinations hereinafter set forth are supplementary,and in addition to, the findings and determinations previously made inconnection with the issuance of the aforesaid orders and each previouslyissued amendment thereto; and all of said previous findings and determinationsare hereby ratified and affirmed, except insofar as such findings and determinationsmay be in conflict with the findings and determinations set forth herein.<ITAG tagnum="81">(a) Findings Upon the Basis of the Hearing Record</ITAG>Pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Actof 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>], and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governingthe formulation of marketing agreements and marketing orders [7 CFR Part900], a public hearing was held upon proposed amendment of Marketing OrderNos. 907 and 908 [7 CFR Parts 907 and 908], regulating the handling ofnavel and Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated parts of California.<T3>Upon the basis of the record, it is found that</T3>:(1) The said orders, as amended, and as hereby further amended, and allof the terms and conditions thereof, will tend to effectuate the declaredpolicy of the Act;(2) The said orders, as amended, and as hereby further amended, regulatethe handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in the designated productionarea in the same manner as, and are applicable only to persons in the respectiveclasses of commercial and industrial activity specified in, the marketingorders upon which hearings have been held;(3) The said orders, as amended, and as hereby further amended, are limitedin their application to the smallest regional production areas which arepracticable, consistent with carrying out the declared policy of the Act,and the issuance of several orders applicable to subdivisions of the productionareas would not effectively carry out the declared policy of the Act;(4) The said orders, as amended, and as hereby further amended, prescribe,so far as practicable, such different terms, applicable to different partsof the production areas, as are necessary to give due recognition to differencesin the production and marketing of navel and Valencia oranges; and(5) All handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in the designatedproduction areas is in the current of interstate or foreign commerce ordirectly burdens, obstructs, or affects such commerce.<ITAG tagnum="81">(b) Additional Findings</ITAG>It is necessary and in the public interest to make all of the amendatoryprovisions effective upon publication in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Any delay beyond that date would interfere witheffective order administration.The provisions of these amendatory orders authorize tenure requirements(for Valencia oranges only), changes in the basis for industry representationon the committees, inclusion of a definition of Capper-Volstead cooperativesin the orders, and the use of total dispositions for determining nominatingrights. It is necessary to implement these changes as soon as possibleas nominations of members to the Navel Orange Administrative Committee(NOAC) should be completed by October 1, 1988, and a new Valencia OrangeAdministrative Committee (VOAC) will be selected soon after. For thesereasons, new nomination procedures implementing the provisions of eachorder are necessary to allow the nomination of new members to the committeesand will be published separately.In view of the foregoing, it is hereby found and determined that good causeexists for making this amendatory order effective upon publication in the<T4>Federal Register, </T4>and that it would be contrary to the publicinterest to delay the effective date of this order for 30 days after publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> [Sec. 553(d), Administrative Procedure Act, 5U.S.C. 551-559].<ITAG tagnum="81">(c) Determinations</ITAG>It is hereby determined that:(1) Handlers (excluding cooperative associations of producers who are notengaged in processing, distributing, or shipping the commodity coveredby the said order, as amended, and as hereby further amended) who, duringthe period November 1, 1987, through June 30, 1988, for navel oranges andduring the period February 1, 1987, through January 31, 1988, for Valenciaoranges, handled not less than 80 percent of the volume of such orangescovered by the said orders, as amended and as hereby further amended havenot signed a marketing agreement; and(2) The provisions of the amendatory order, amending the aforesaid orders,as amended, were favored by at least three-fourths of the producers whoparticipated in the respective referendum, or by producers who producedfor market at least two-thirds of the volume of such commodity representedin the respective referendum, all such producers having been engaged duringthe aforementioned representative periods within the respective productionareas in the production of such oranges for market.(3) In the absence of signed marketing agreements, the issuance of thisamendatory order is the only practical means pursuant to the declared policyof the Act of advancing the interests of producers of navel and Valenciaoranges in the respective production areas.Order Relative to Handling <T3>It is, therefore, ordered, </T3>That, on and after the effective datehereof, all handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in the respectiveproduction areas shall be in conformity to, and in compliance with, theterms and conditions of the said marketing orders, as amended, and as herebyfurther amended, as follows: Except for the previously noted modifications, the provisions of the proposedmarketing orders amending the orders contained in the Recommended Decisionissued by the Administrator on June 1, 1987, and published in the June8, 1987, issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> [52 FR 20664], and in the Secretary's Decisionissued on June 6, 1988, and published in the June 9, 1988, issue of the<T4>Federal Register</T4> [53 FR 21659] shall be and are the terms andprovisions of these orders, amending the orders, and are set forth in fullherein subject to changes in andSection;andSection; 907.19, 908.19(a), 907.20,908.20, 907.21, 908.21, 907.22, 908.22, 907.23, 908.23, 907.24, 908.24,907.26, 908.26, 907.27, 908.27, 907.29, 908.29, 907.30, 908.30, 907.104,and 908.104, which are set forth in full herein. 1.
