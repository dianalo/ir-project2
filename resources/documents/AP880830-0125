A U.S. technical team will meet with Vietnamese authorities inHanoi to work out details for a joint field survey and excavationactivities in Vietnam, department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.The meeting is tentatively set for Sept. 9-12.   ``We welcome this resumption of cooperation and anticipate thatthe joint field activities will make a major contribution inachieving the fullest possible accounting for Americans stillmissing in Vietnam,'' she said.   She said a U.S. team also will visit Hanoi on Sept. 5-8 todiscuss a plan to allow private American organizations to treatVietnamese with war-related disabilities.   On Aug. 3, Vietnam suspended cooperation with the United Stateson the accounting effort. Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said hisgovernment was retaliating against a ``hostile policy'' the UnitedStates was pursuing against Vietnam.   His statement was prompted by testimony in late July in whichAssistant Secretary of State Gaston Sigur reaffirmed thelongstanding U.S. policy of maintaining diplomatic distance fromHanoi until its troops are withdrawn from Cambodia.   The United States has agreed to discuss humanitarian issues withVietnam but says there can be no trade or diplomatic relationsbetween the two countries until the Cambodian issue is resolved.   Sigur said the Reagan administration was opposed to a proposalby several members of Congress to establish a small U.S. diplomaticmission in Hanoi.   Mrs. Oakley said Vietnam has not agreeed to resume discussionson resettlement in the United States of former political detaineeswho were associated with the former U.S.-backed government inSaigon.   She expressed disappointment there will be no discussions onthat issue but said the administration hopes the two Septembermeetings ``will initiate a period of increased cooperation on allhumanitarian issues of mutual interest.''</TEXT></DOC>
