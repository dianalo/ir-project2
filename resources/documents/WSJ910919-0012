Sen.Brock Adams (D., Wash.) spoke for the Senate majority when hesaid, &quot;We simply cannot continue to have more and more peopleand fewer and fewer resources and not expect the famines, thehunger and starvation.&quot;   There's just one problem with the senator's rationale: Theworld isn't running out of food or farming resources.</LP><TEXT>   The globe could feed another two billion people right now,mainly on the good land diverted from crops by governmentpolicies in the U.S. and Argentina.   We could feed four billion more people if the Third Worldfully adopted the latest high-yield farm technologies --including hybrid rice, high-protein corn and acid-tolerantseed varieties for a billion acres of currently barren acidsoil savannahs.   Public TV's &quot;Race to Save the Planet&quot; series says flatlythat world food production is falling behind populationgrowth. This isn't so. Per-capita food supplies in the ThirdWorld have increased 25% above subsistence since 1960 --during the peak of the current population growth surge. TheU.S. Agency for International Development's newly completeddemographic survey shows Third World birth rates slowing morerapidly than anyone had predicted. And Third World foodproduction continues to rise twice as fast as its population.   Congressmen make headlines with overseas trips to &quot;fighthunger.&quot; But to find famine today, they have to go to anAfrican country experiencing both drought and war. The threatof severe hunger, which once faced perhaps a half of theworld's population on a frequent basis, now threatens perhaps3% to 5% in most years. And even Africa is now gettinghigh-yielding crop varieties and farming systems, after alate start in farm research.   The Natural Resources Defense Council says that we need a&quot;chemical free&quot; agriculture to protect wildlife. But withoutscience-based agriculture we'd already have plowed underanother 10 million square miles of wildlife habitat for food.Instead, because we have raised yields on existing cropland-- with better seeds, irrigation, fertilizer and pest control-- we're feeding twice as many people on the same farm landwe used in 1960.   Today's crop pesticides pose little danger to humans orwildlife. Their residues are less toxic than mustard orpickles. DDT is long gone; the new compounds use a few ouncesper acre instead of pounds, degrade in hours or days, andtarget narrowly on insects and weeds. Fertilizer is no threatto anything when used moderately to replace nutrients takenup by crops.   Lester Brown, editor of World Watch magazine, says the bigfood gains are an &quot;illusion of progress&quot; produced bydestroying topsoil and mining groundwater. But he doesn'ttell us about the new conservation technologies:   -- &quot;Conservation tillage&quot; systems halve soil-erosion rateson hundreds of millions of acres in North America and WesternEurope.   -- In West Africa, a new system called &quot;alley cropping&quot;eliminates much of the need for slash-and-burn farming.   -- In the Amazon rain forest, a legume called Kudzu cancut the environmental impact of slash-and-burn farming 90%.   -- Farmers waste a third of the world's water with floodirrigation. New sprinkler, drip and trailing-tube irrigationsystems could double water-use efficiency. In fact, theworld's worst soil erosion problems are in the regions tryingto feed more people with traditional agriculture.   Some agriculturists warn that existing farm technologieshave been &quot;used up.&quot; But other researchers are just beginningto harness the awesome power of genetic engineering:   -- Engineering more growth hormone in a hog's system cangive us pork with one-third less fat, produced withone-fourth less feed grain. In effect, the growth hormonewill manufacture 30 million to 40 million tons of feed corn ayear from laboratory bacteria.   -- Cloning and tissue culture have produced a revolutionin tree breeding, typically raising yields four-fold. Thusthe forest products we need can be produced on less acreage.   The reality of the world's food and environmental gainsare confirmed by all the major published data series,including the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization, andthe U.S. Department of Agriculture. Every reputable study ofthe world's &quot;carrying capacity&quot; has concluded that the worldcan feed its expected population growth.   The job won't be easy: It will take continuing, andbroadening, investments in agricultural research andinfrastructure. Even more important will be good economicpolicies in Third World countries. But the evidence arguesconvincingly that the job can be done.   Where are the headlines trumpeting this good news? Whereare the interviews with enthusiastic internationalscientists? Where are the features about Tanzania doublingits grain production? Instead, we get sermons on the need fororganic farming -- which is not yet a success. The zealotspushing wilderness and zero population growth have been fartoo willing to indict farm science as irrelevant and/ordangerous. They're trying to back us into an intellectualcorner from which economic stagnation and populationsuppression will seem the only escape.   At the same time, the decline of public confidence in the&quot;establishment&quot; has left agricultural science with preciousfew defenders. After all, most of the new food-productionwonders were developed by big corporations, labs andgovernments.   Farmers won't make the defense. They like new technology,but only if it adds to their profits. They dislike newtechnology if it permits farmers in other countries toproduce more -- and that is happening as farm technologyspreads overseas.   The science establishment has certainly made no effort toshoot down the fearmongers. Some researchers actuallywelcomed the phony famine predictions on the theory thatfamine fears would generate more research funds. Instead, thefamine activists have shifted public funding away from realagricultural research toward organic farming and populationmanagement.   The public, no longer willing to believe the AgricultureDepartment, the Food and Drug Administration or the localuniversity's entomology department, is now at the mercy of agleeful troupe of media performers. These activists arecapitalizing on memberships, newsletters, donations, booksand public-policy campaigns.   Food is usually part of the fear campaigns, because foodis so basic to our lives. So far, scientists have played intothe fearmongers' hands. Good scientists disapprove ofheadline-hunting and never develop the skill. Ironically,famine-mongering and environmental activism may now lead tomore hunger and more environmental losses. If the claims ofpoisoned wildlife and lost genetic diversity convince thegeneral public that farm science is bad, we could lose themomentum of our agricultural research. That would mean slowerprogress against hunger, and slower world economic growth. Itwould also threaten the environment and wildlife far moredrastically than pesticides.   The world's farm resource demands are rising even morerapidly than the famine-mongers have warned us. In the 1990s,population growth will raise world food demand about 18%. Butincome-driven diet improvements will raise the demands onworld agricultural resources an additional 20% to 30%. Totalfarm resource demand could increase 30% to 50%, just in the1990s.   Without still more gains in farm productivity, that risingdemand will translate directly into environmental stress.Third World people are still driven by a fierce desire tolive and eat better. If that means using fragile semi-aridfarm land more intensively, so be it.   The environmental struggle won't be won or lost in Bostonor Iowa. It will be won or lost in the densely populatedcountries of Asia. Since a better diet is the first goal ofpeople gaining affluence, a continuing flow of agriculturaltechnology is now especially critical to environmentalsustainability. But if we continue to be misled on hunger, wemay not have solutions to offer.   ---   Mr. Avery is a fellow of the Hudson Institute inIndianapolis and principal author of Hudson's new book,&quot;Global Food Progress 1991.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
