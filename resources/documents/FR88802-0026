Background </ITAG>A. Authority On January 16, 1981, as part of its final and interim final regulationsimplementing section 3001 of RCRA, EPA published an amended list of hazardouswastes from non-specific and specific sources. This list has been amendedseveral times, and is published in 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32. These wastesare listed as hazardous because they typically and frequently exhibit oneor more of the characteristics of hazardous wastes identified in SubpartC of Part 261 (<T3>i.e.,</T3> ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and extraction procedure(EP) toxicity) or meet the criteria for listing contained in 40 CFR 261.11(a)(2) or (a)(3). Individual waste streams may vary, however, depending on raw materials,industrial processes, and other factors. Thus, while a waste that is describedin these regulations generally is hazardous, a specific waste from an individualfacility meeting the listing description may not be. For this reason, 40CFR 260.20 and 260.22 provide an exclusion procedure, allowing personsto demonstrate that a specific waste from a particular generating facilityshould not be regulated as a hazardous waste. To have their wastes excluded, petitioners must show that wastes generatedat their facilities do not meet any of the criteria for which the wasteswere listed. See 40 CFR 260.22(a) and the background documents for thelisted wastes. In addition, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA)of 1984 require the Agency to consider any factors (including additionalconstituents) other than those for which the waste was listed, if thereis a reasonable basis to believe that such additional factors could causethe waste to be hazardous. Accordingly, a petitioner also must demonstratethat the waste does not exhibit any of the hazardous characteristics (<T3>i.e.,</T3> ignitability, reactivity, corrosivity, and EP toxicity),and must present sufficient information for the Agency to determine whetherthe waste contains any other toxicants at hazardous levels. See 40 CFR260.22(a), 42 U.S.C. 6921(f), and the background documents for the listedwastes. Although wastes which are ``delisted'' (<T3>i.e.,</T3> excluded) have been evaluated to determine whether or notthey exhibit any of the characteristics of a hazardous waste, generatorsremain obligated to determine whether or not their waste remains non-hazardousbased on the hazardous waste characteristics. In addition to wastes listed as hazardous in 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32,residues from the treatment, storage, or disposal of listed hazardous wastesand mixtures containing hazardous wastes also are eligible for exclusionand remain hazardous wastes until excluded. See 40 CFR 261.3 (c) and (d)(2).The substantive standard for ``delisting'' a treatment residue or a mixtureis the same as previously described for listed wastes. B. Approach Used To Evaluate This Petition In making a delisting determination, the Agency evaluates each petitionedwaste against the listing criteria and factors cited in 40 CFR 261.11 (a)(2)and (a)(3). If the Agency believes that the waste remains hazardous basedon the factors for which the waste was originally listed, EPA will proposeto deny the petition. If, however, the Agency agrees with the petitionerthat the waste is non-hazardous with respect to the original listing criteria,EPA then will evaluate the waste with respect to other factors or criteria,if there is a reasonable basis to believe that such additional factorscould cause the waste to be hazardous. The Agency considers whether thewaste is acutely toxic, and considers the toxicity of the constituents,the concentration of the constituents in the waste, their tendency to migrateand to bioaccumulate, their persistence in the environment once releasedfrom the waste, plausible and specific types of management of the petitionedwaste, the quantities of waste generated, and any other additional factorswhich may characterize the petitioned waste. The Agency is proposing to use such information to identify plausible exposureroutes for hazardous constituents present in the waste, and is proposingto use a fate and transport model to predict the concentration of hazardousconstituents that may be released from the petitioned waste after disposaland to determine the potential impact of the unregulated disposal of CFandamp;ISteel Corporation's petitioned waste on human health and the environment.Specifically, the model will be ued to predict compliance-point concentrationswhich will be compared directly to the levels of regulatory concern forparticular hazardous constituents. EPA believes that this model represents a reasonable worst-case waste disposalscenario for the petitioned waste, and that a reasonable worst-case scenariois appropriate when evaluating whether a waste should be relieved of theprotective management constraints of RCRA Subtitle C. Because a delistedwaste is no longer subject to hazardous waste control, the Agency is generallyunable to predict and does not control how a waste will be managed afterdelisting. Therefore, EPA currently believes that it is inappropriate forthe Delisting Program to consider extensive site-specific factors. Forexample, a generator may petition the Agency for delisting of a metal hydroxidesludge which is currently being managed in an on-site landfill and providedata on the nearest drinking water well, permeability of the aquifer, dispersivities,etc. If the Agency were to base its evaluation solely on these site-specificfactors, the Agency might conclude that the waste, at that specific location,cannot affect the closest well, and the Agency might grant the petition.Upon promulgation of the exclusion, however, the generator is under noobligation to continue to manage the waste at the on-site landfill. Infact, it is likely that the generator will either choose to send the delistedwaste off-site immediately, or will eventually reach the capacity of theon-site facility and subsequently send the waste off-site to a facilitywhich may have very different hydrogeological and exposure conditions.The Agency also considers the applicability of ground-water monitoringdata to its evaluation of delisting petitions. In this case, the Agencydetermined that, because CFandamp;I Steel Corporation is seeking an upfrontdelisting (<T3>i.e.,</T3> an exclusion for wastes generated from a laboratory-scaletreatment process), ground-water monitoring data collected from the areawhere the petitioner plans to dispose of the waste is not necessary. Becausethe petitioned waste stream is not currently generated or disposed of,ground-water data would not characterize the effects of the petitionedwaste on the underlying aquifer at the disposal site, and, thus, wouldserve no propose. CFandamp;I Steel Corporation petitioned the Agency for an upfront exclusion(for wastes that have not yet been generated) based on a laboratory-scalewaste treatment process (<T3>i.e.,</T3> a scaled-down version of a proposed treatment system), untreatedwaste characteristics, and process descriptions. Additionally, the Agencyis proposing that verification testing requirements (<T3>i.e.,</T3> required analytical testing of representative samples obtainedfrom the full-scale treatment system verifying that the treatment systemis one-line and operating as described in the petition) be made conditionsof the exclusion. These conditions, if the exclusion is granted, will beimplemented in order to show that, once on-line, the treatment system canrender the waste non-hazardous by meeting the Agency's verification testinglimitations (<T3>i.e.,</T3> the maximum allowable levels of the hazardous constituentsof concern present in the waste, below which, the waste would not be consideredhazardous). From the evaluation of CFandamp;I Steel Corporation's upfront delisting petition,a list of constitutents was developed for the verification testing. Tentativemaximum allowable treated waste concentrations for these constituents thenwere derived by back calculating from the regulatory standards throughthe use of the proposed fate and transport model for a landfill managementscenario. These levels (<T3>i.e.,</T3> ``delisting levels'') are proposed conditions of the delisting.The Agency encourages the use of upfront delisting petitions because theyhave the advantage of allowing the applicant to know what treatment levelsfor constituents should be sufficient to render specific wastes non-hazardous,before investing in new or modified waste treatment systems. Therefore,upfront delisting will allow new facilities to receive exclusions priorto generating wastes which, without upfront exclusions, would unnecessarilyhave been considered hazardous. Upfront delistings for existing facilitiescan be processed concurrently during construction or permitting activities;therefore, new or modified treatment systems should be capable of producingwastes that are considered non-hazardous sooner than otherwise would bepossible. At the same time, conditional batch testing requirements to submitdata verifying that the delisting levels are achieved by the fully operationalmanufacturing/treatment systems will maintain the integrity of the delistingprogram and will ensure that only non-hazardous wastes are removed fromSubtitle C control. Finally, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 specificallyrequire the Agency to provide notice and an opportunity for comment beforegranting or denying a final exclusion. Thus, a final decision will notbe made on this petition proposed today until all public comments (includingthose at requested hearings, if any) are addressed. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Disposition of Petition </ITAG>CFandamp;I Steel Corporation, Pueblo, Colorado <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Petition for Exclusion </ITAG>CFandamp;I Steel Corporation (CFandamp;I), located in Pueblo, Colorado, producesrails, associated rail products, reinforcing bars, billets, rounds, seamlesstube, wire, and bars. CFandamp;I petitioned the Agency to exclude its chemicallystablized electric arc furnace dust (CSEADF), presently listed as EPA HazardousWaste No. K061_``Emission control dust/sludge from the primary productionof steel in electric furnaces.'' The listed constituents of concern forEPA Hazardous Waste No. K061 are cadmium, chromium, and lead. CFandamp;Ipetitioned to exclude its waste because it does not believe that the wastewill meet the Criteria for which it was listed. CFandamp;I also believesthat its treatment process will generate a non-hazardous waste becausethe constituents of concern, although present in the waste, will be inan essentially immobile form. CFandamp;I further believes that the wastewill not be hazardous for any other reason (<T3>i.e.,</T3> there are no additional constituents or factors that couldcause the waste to be hazardous). Review of this petition included considerationof the original listing criteria, as well as the additional factors requiredby the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. See section 222 ofthe Amendments, 42 U.S.C. 6921(f), and 40 CFR 260.22(d)(2)-(4). Today'sproposal to grant this petition for delisting is the result of the Agency'sevaluation of CFandamp;I's petition. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Background </ITAG>CFandamp;I petitioned the Agency to exclude its CSEAFD on November 20, 1987and subsequently provided additional information to complete its petition.In support of its petition, CFandamp;I submitted (1) detailed descriptionsof its manufacturing and proposed Solifix waste treatment processes; \1\<NOTE/> (2) a list of all the raw materials used in both the manufacturingand treatment processes; (3) results from total constituent analyses forall the EP toxic metal, nickel, cyanide, and total sulfide from representativesamples of the untreated EAF dust; (4) results from the EP toxicity andthe multiple extraction procedure (MEP) analyses (required for stabilizedwastes) for all the EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanide from representativesamples of the fully-cured (<T3>i.e.,</T3> hardened) CSEAFD derived from a bench-scale treatment system;(5) results from total oil and grease analyses on representative samplesof the untreated EAF dust; and (6) test results for the hazardous wastecharacteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, and reactivity. Once CFandamp;I'sfull-scale treatment system is on-line, EPA proposes that CFandamp;I be requiredto perform analyses for EP leachate concentrations of all the EP toxicmetals, nickel, and cyanide, and total constituent concentrations of totalreactive sulfide and total reactive cyanide on batches of treated waste(see section 6_<T3>Verification Testing Conditions</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ CFandamp;I has claimed that the Solifix treatment processis confidential and proprietary; therefore, the Agency is handling informationon the Solifix treatment process as Confidential Business Information (CBI).CFandamp;I produces the products noted above by processing steel scraps intwo electric arc furnaces (EAFs). The scrap steel is melted and refinedin the furnace when an electric arc surges between the electrodes and scrap.When the molten steel reaches 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, it is poured intoa ladle and cast into ingot molds.The EAFs produce dust during (1) melting of scrap, (2) pouring molten steel,(3) pneumatic injection of additives, (4) oxygen blowing, and (5) meltdown/refiningperiods. The EAF dust is conveyed pneumatically from the EAF dust baghousesto the storage silo.The EAF dust is then mixed with specific amounts of certain chemicals ina prescribed ratio in accordance with the Solifix proprietary processingsequence. CFandamp;I tested laboratory-scale levels of fully-cured stabilizedwaste derived from an experimental treatment unit. Data from this unitwere submitted as the basis for an upfront delisting petition. CFandamp;Iplans to construct a full-scale mixing and stabilization facility if theirlaboratory-scale system produces treated wastes that support an upfrontdelisting decision. The fully-cured chemically stablized EAF dust wouldbe disposed of at a non-harzardous dedicated landfill, if the exclusionis granted.To collect representative samples from EAF baghouses like CFandamp;I's, petitionersare normally requested to collect a minimum of four composite samples comprisedof independent grab samples collected over time (<T3>e.g., </T3>grab samples collected every hour and composited by shift,etc.). See ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Wastes: Physical/ChemicalMethods,'' U.S. EPA Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, PublicationSW-846 (third edition), November 1986, and ``Petitions to Delist HazardousWastes_A Guidance Manual,'' U.S. EPA, Office of Solid Waste, (EPA/530-SW-85-003),April 1985.Over a 40 day period, between July 10, 1987 and August 19, 1987, CFandamp;Icollected a total of sixty grab samples of the EAF dust from the two EAFdust hoppers prior to the pneumatic transfer of the EAF dust to the storagesilo. Each sample was collected in a one gallon container on a staggeredschedule rotating between mid-morning, mid-day, and mid-afternoon duringthe daily melt cycle. The two daily samples (one from each EAF dust hopper)were mixed to produce thirty daily composite samples. The thirty dailycomposite samples were further composited to produce fifteen sequentialdaily composite samples (<T3>i.e., </T3>day 1 and day 2, day 3 and day 4, day 5 and day 6, etc.).The fifteen sequential daily composite samples were analyzed for totalconstituent concentrations (<T3>i.e., </T3>mass of a particular constituent per mass of waste) of allthe EP toxic metals, nickels, and cyanide, the total constituent concentrationof sulfide, and total oil and grease content. The fifteen samples thenwere ranked by the total constituent concentrations of cadmium, chromium,and lead, and the three highest composite samples were segregated for directSolifix process fixation. The remaining twelve composite samples were dividedinto three groups of four and further composited to produce three additionalcomposite samples for Solifix process fixation. EP and MEP leachate analyseswere performed on the six fully-cured CSEAFD samples to quantify the leachateconcentrations of all the EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanide (<T3>i.e., </T3>mass of a particular constituent per unit volume of extract).CFandamp;I claims that due to a consistent manufacturing and treament process,the analyses from samples collected over a five-week period are representativeof any variation in fully-cured CSEAFD constituent concentrations.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Agency Analysis</ITAG>CFandamp;I used SW-846 method numbers 7061-7760, 9010, and 9030 to quantifythe total constituent concentrations of all the EP toxic metals, nickel,cyanide, and sulfide in the untreated EAF dust. CFandamp;I used SW-846 methodnumbers 1310 (standard EP) and 1320 (MEP) to quantify the leachable concentrationsof the EP toxic metals, nickels, and cyanide in the fully-cured CSEAFD.Table 1 presents the maximum total constituent concentrations of the EPtoxic metals, nickel, cyanide, and sulfide. Tables 2 and 3 present themaximum EP leachate values and maximum MEP leachate values, respectively,of the EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanide. (Analysis for EP or MEP leachableconcentrations of sulfide (or reactive sulfide) is not necessary sincethe Agency's level of regulatory concern is based on the total constituentconcentration of reactive sulfide.) Detection limits represent the lowestconcentrations quantifiable by CFandamp;I when using the appropriate SW-846analytical methods to analyze its waste. (Detection limits may vary accordingto the waste and waste matrix being analyzed, <T3>i.e., </T3>the ``cleanliness'' of waste matrices varies, and ``dirty''waste matrices may cause interferences, thus raising the detection limit.)<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 1._Maximum Total Constituent Concentrations Untreated EAF Dust</T4><H1>Constituents</H1><H1>Total constituent concentrations (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic <D>ND (below detection limit of 1.0).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium <D> 224.0.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D> 410.0.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>1360.0.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>5170.0.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury <D>  29.0.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium <D>ND (below detection limit of 1.0).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver <D> 85.0.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D> 260.0.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanide <D>ND (below detection limit of 0.2).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sulfide <D>ND (below detection limit of 10.0).</D><F>ND: Not Detected.

CFandamp;I also submitted test results forthe characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, and reactivity. See 40CFR 261.21, 261.22, and 261.23.CFandamp;I submitted a signed certification stating that, based on the currentannual waste generation and the laboratory-scale mixing ratio of reagentof EAF dust, its maximum annual generation rate of CSEAFD will be 35,000tons. The Agency reviews a petitioner's estimates and, on occasion, hasrequested a petitioner to re-evaluate estimated waste volume. EPA acceptsCFandamp;I's certified estimate of 35,000 tons (approximately 34,500 cubicyards).EPA does not generally verify submitted test data before proposing delistingdecisions, and has not verified the data upon which it purposes to grantCFandamp;I's exclusion. The sworn affidavit submitted with this petitionbinds the petitioner to present truthful and accurate results. The Agency,however, has previously conducted a spot-sampling and analysis programto verify the representative nature of the date for some percentage ofthe submitted petitions, and may elect to visit this facility in the futurefor spot-sampling.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Agency Evaluation</ITAG>The Agency considered the appropriateness of alternative disposal scenariosfor stabilized wastes and decided that a landfill scenario is the mostreasonable, worst-case scenario for this waste. Under a landfill disposalscenario, the major exposure route of concern for any hazardous constituentswould be ingestion of contaminated ground water. The Agency, therefore,evaluated the petitioned waste using its vertical and horizontal spread(VHS) landfill mode which predicts the potential for ground-water contaminationfrom wastes that are landfilled. See 50 FR 7882 (February 26, 1985), 50FR 48896 (November 27, 1985), and the RCRA public docket for these noticesfor a detailed description of the VHS model and its parameters. This modelingapproach, which includes a ground-water transport scenario, was used withconservative, generic parameters, to predict reasonable worst-case contaminantlevels in ground water at a hypothetical receptor well (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the model estimates the ability of an aquifer to dilutethe toxicant from a specific volume of waste). The Agency requests commentson the use of the VHS model as applied to the evaluation of CFandamp;I'swaste.Specifically, the Agency used the VHS model to evaluate the mobility ofall the inorganic constituents (except mercury and cyanide_see explanationbelow) from CFandamp;I's fully-cured CSEAFD waste. The Agency's evaluation,using the CSEAFD volume of 34,500 cubic yards and the maximun EP leachateconcentrations of all the inorganic constituents of concern in the VHSmodel, generated the compliance-point concentrations shown in Table 4.The Agency did not evaluate the mobility of the remaining inorganic constituents(<T3>i.e.</T3>, mercury and cyanide) from CFandamp;I's waste because theywere not detected in the EP extract using the appropriate SW-846 analyticaltest methods (see Table 2). The Agency believes that it is inappropriateto evaluate non-detectable concentrations of a constituent of concern inits modeling effort if the non-detectable value was obtained using theappropriate analytical method. Specifically, if a constituent cannot bedetected (when using the appropriate analytical method) the Agency assumesthat the constituent is not present and therefore does not present a threatto either human health or the environment.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,10,8.2</C><T4>Table 4</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">VHS: Calculated Complicance-Point Concentrations Listed and Non-ListedConstituents Fully-Cured CSEAFD</ITAG><H1>Constituents </H1><H1>Compliance-point concentrations (mg/l) </H1><H1>Regulatory standards (mg/l) \1\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic <D>0.0079 </D><D>0.05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium <D>0.2330 </D><D>1.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>0.0097 </D><D>0.01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>0.0447 </D><D>0.05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.0398 </D><D>0.05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>0.3990 </D><D>0.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium <D>0.0079 </D><D>0.01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver <D>0.0065 </D><D>0.05</D><F>\1\ See ``Docket Report on Health-Based Regulatory Levels and solubilitiesUsed in the Evaluation of Delisting Petitions,'' June 8, 1988, locatedin the RCRA public docket.</F></ITAG></ITAG>The fully-cured CSEAFD exhibited arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead,nickel, selenium, and silver levels at the compliance point below the Agency'shealth-base levels used in delisting decision making.The Agency used the MEP test to assess the long-term stability of CFandamp;I'sfully-cured stabilized waste. In this procedure, a sample of CFandamp;I'sfully-cured stabilized waste was ground and passed through a 100x meshscreen in order to determine whether the metals are chemically bound inthe waste matrix. Once a sample was prepared, a series of nine syntheticacid rain extractions was performed in order to determine whether the metalswould leach from the waste matrix over time. The MEP data reported in Table3 indicate that the fully-cured CSEAFD treatment residue exhibits long-termstability by leaching non-hazardous levels of metals after multiple extractions.Because the concentration of total cyanide is less than 0.2 mg/kg, theAgency believes that the concentration of reactive cyanide will be belowthe Agency's interim standard of 250 ppm. See ``Interim Agency Thresholdfor Toxic Gas Generation,'' July 12, 1985, internal Agency memorandum,in the RCRA public docket. Lastly, because the total constituent concentrationof total sulfide is less than 10 mg/kg, the Agency believes that the concentrationof reactive sulfide will be below the Agency's interim standard of 500ppm. See ``Interim Agency Threshold for Toxic Gas Generation,'' July 12,1985, internal Agency memorandum, in the RCRA public docket.The Agency concluded, after reviewing CFandamp;I's processes and raw materialslist, that no other hazardous constituents of concern are being used byCFandamp;I, and that no other constituents of concern are likely to be presentor formed as reaction products or by-products of CFandamp;I's waste. On thebasis of test results submitted by the petitioner pursuant to andSection;260.22, the Agency concludes that the waste does no exhibit any of thecharacteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, or reactivity. See 40 CFR261.21, 261.22, and 261.23.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Conclusion</ITAG>The Agency believes that CFandamp;I's Solifix treatment system can renderthe K061 wastes non-hazardous. The Agency believes that the analyzed samplesof the fully-cured treated waste reflect the day-to-day variations in manufacturingand treatment processes for both the particular grades of scrap used andthe particular grades of steel produced during the demonstration periodand that are intended to be used and produced, thereafter. The Agency,therefore, is proposing that CFandamp;I's fully-cured CSEAFD waste, if itmeets certain verification testing requirements, be considered non-hazardous,as it should not present a hazard to either human health or the environment.The Agency proposes to grant a conditional exclusion to the CFandamp;I SteelCorporation, located in Pueblo, Colorado, for its fully cured chemicallystabilized electric arc furnace dust treatment residue described in theirpetition as EPA Hazardous Waste No. K061. If the proposed rule becomeseffective, the fully cured treatment residue would no longer be subjectto regulation under 40 CFR Parts 262 through 268 and the permitting standardsof 40 CFR Part 270.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Verification Testing Conditions</ITAG>As stated earlier, the proposed exclusion contains verification testingrequirements. If the final exclusion is granted, the petitioner will berequired both to verify that the treatment system is on-line and operatingas described in the petition, and to show that, once on-line, the treatmentsystem can meet the Agency's verification testing limitations (i.e., ``delistinglevels''). These proposed conditions are specific to the upfront exclusionpetitioned for by CFandamp;I.This proposed exclusion is conditional upon the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Testing:</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) <T3>Initial Testing. </T3>During the first four weeks of operation of thefull-scale treatment system, CFandamp;I must collect representative grabsamples of each treated batch of the CSEAFD and composite the grab samplesdaily. The daily composites, prior to disposal, must be analyzed for theEP leachate concentrations of all the EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanide(using distilled water in the cyanide extractions), and the total constituentconcentrations of reactive sulfide and reactive cyanide. Analyses mustbe performed according to SW-846 methodologies. CFandamp;I must report theanalytical test data obtained during this initial period no later than90 days after the treatment of the first full-scale batch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) <T3>Subsequent Testing. </T3>The daily testing requirements of (1)(A) shallcontinue and the analytical test data must be reported every 90 days followingthe initial report required in (1)(A).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Delisting levels: </T3>If the EP extract concentrations for chromium,lead, arsenic, or silver exceed 0.315 mg/1; for barium exceeds 6.3 mg/1;for cadmium or selenium exceed 0.063 mg/1; for mercury exceeds 0.0126 mg/1;for nickel exceeds 3.15 mg/1; or for cyanide exceeds 4.42 mg/1, or totalreactive cyanide or total reactive sulfide levels exceed 250 mg/kg and500 mg/kg, respectively, the waste must either be re-treated until it meetsthese levels or managed and disposed of in accordance with Subtitle C ofRCRA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Termination of Testing. </T3>The requirements of condition (1)(B) shallbe terminated by EPA when the results of four consecutive daily compositesfor the petitioned waste show the maximum allowable levels in condition(2) are not exceeded and the Chief, Variances Section, notifies CFandamp;Ithat the conditions have been lifted.</ITAG>The Agency has determined, through its review of similar petitions fromthe iron and steel industry, that approximately four weeks are requiredfor a facility to train operators and to collect sufficient data to verifythat a full-scale stabilization process is operating correctly. Accordingly,the Agency is proposing an initial testing condition and a subsequent testingcondition.The proposed initial testing condition would require CFandamp;I to collectdaily composite samples during the first four weeks of operation of thefull-scale treatment system. The Agency proposed this initial testing conditionboth to gather data obtained from the full-scale treatment system and toensure that the full-scale treatment system is closely monitored duringthe start-up period.The proposed subsequent testing condition would be effective once the initialtesting period is completed. It would provide the Agency with final verificationdata showing that the full-scale treatment system is operating as describedin the petition. As proposed, the subsequent testing condition would requirea CFandamp;I to continue the daily testing and reporting requirements ofthe initial testing condition until EPA received the results from fourconsecutive daily composites of the petitioned waste showing that the maximumallowable levels (<T3>i.e., </T3>the delisting levels of condition (2)) were not exceededand the Chief, Variances Section, notified CFandamp;I that the conditionshad been lifted.The Agency is proposing a mechanism to terminate the testing and reportingrequirements of the subsequent testing condition for the following reasons:(1) Based on the laboratory-scale data submitted by CFandamp;I, the Agencybelieves that consistently non-hazardous wastes can be generated from theCSEAFD treatment process and thus continued testing would be excessive;and (2) termination of this condition after four consecutive daily compositesmeeting the delisting levels of condition (2) is consistent with existingpolicy that testing may be terminated for continuously generated wastesafter taking a minimum of four representative samples if those wastes arewell mixed and uniformly produced. (EPA normally requests a minimum offour samples of a continuously generated waste.) See ``Test Methods forEvaluating Solid Wastes: Physical/Chemical Methods,'' U.S. EPA Office ofSolid Waste and Emergency Response, Publication SW-846 (third edition),November 1986, and ``Petitions to Delist Hazardous Wastes_A Guidance Manual,''U.S. EPA, Office of Solid Waste (EPA/530-SW-85-003), April 1985.Future upfront delisting proposals and decisions issued by the Agency mayinclude different testing and reporting requirements based on an evaluationof the uniformity of the process and of the waste, of the waste volume(including whether there is a fixed volume of waste or an infinite source),and of other factors normally considered in the petition review process.For example, wastes with variable constituent concentrations, discussedin previous delisting decisions (<T3>e.g., </T3>see 51 FR 41323, November 14, 1986), may require continuousbatch testing.<ITAG tagnum="21">(4) <T3>Data submittals: </T3>All data must be submitted to the Chief, VariancesSection, PSPD/OSW (WH-563), U.S. EPA, 401 M Street, S.W., Washington, DC20460 within the time period specified in (1)(A) and (1)(B), respectively.Failure to submit the required data will be considered by the Agency sufficientbasis to revoke CFandamp;I's exclusion to the extent directed by EPA.

The facility would require a newexclusion if either its manufacturing or treatment processes are alteredor if the percentage of each different type of scrap metal (<T3>i.e., </T3>molds and stools, cast scrap, haystack and pot buttons,mill scrap, ferro process scrap, borings and turnings, miscellaneous furnacescrap, and roll scale briquettes) used to charge the furnace falls outsidethe percent range of each type of scrap metal historically used to chargethe furnaces (as documented in the petition). Accordingly, CFandamp;I wouldneed to file a new petition. The facility must treat waste generated fromchanged processes as hazardous until a new exclusion is granted.Although management of the waste covered by this petition would be relievedfrom Subtitle C jurisdiction upon final promulgation of an exclusion, thegenerator of a delisted waste must either treat, store, or dispose of thewaste in an on-site facility, or ensure that the waste is delivered toan off-site treatment, storage, or disposal facility, either of which ispermitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage municipal or industrialsolid waste. Alternatively, the delisted waste may be delivered to a facilitythat beneficially uses or reuses, or legitimately recycles or reclaimsthe waste, or treats the waste prior to such beneficial use, reuse, recycling,or reclamation.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Effective date</ITAG>This rule, if promulgated, will become effective immediately. The Hazardousand Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allowrules to become effective in less than six months when the regulated communitydoes not need the six-month period to come into compliance. That is thecase here, because this rule, if promulgated, would reduce the existingrequirements for persons generating hazardous wastes. In light of the unnecessaryhardship and expense that would be imposed on this petitioner by an effectivedate six months after promulgation and the fact that a six-month deadlineis not necessary to achieve the purpose of section 3010, EPA believes thatthis exclusion should be effective immediately upon promulgation. Thesereasons also provide a basis for making this rule effective immediately,upon promulgation, under the Administrative Procedures Act, pursuant to5 U.S.C. 553(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This proposal to grant an exclusion is not major, since its effect, ifpromulgated, would be to reduce the overall costs and economic impact ofEPA's hazardous waste management regulations. This reduction would be achievedby excluding waste generated at a specific facility from EPA's lists ofhazardous wastes, thereby enabling this facility to treat its waste asnon-hazardous. There is no additional economic impact, therefore, due totoday's rule. This proposal is not a major regulation, therefore, no RegulatoryImpact Analysis is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, wheneveran agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (<T3>i.e., </T3>small businesses, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, that the rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.This amendment, if promulgated, will not have an adverse economic impacton small entities since its effect would be to reduce the overall costsof EPA's hazardous waste regulations and would be limited to one facility.Accordingly, I hereby certify that this proposed regulation, if promulgated,will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. This regulation, therefore, does not require a regulatoryflexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 261</ITAG>Hazardous materials, Waste treatment and disposal, recycling.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Sec. 3001 RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: July 25, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffery D.
