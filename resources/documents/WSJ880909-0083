The complaint charges that the county's electoral plan fragments the Hispanic population, thus denying them an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice to the board. The suit says Hispanics have &quot;historically&quot; been the victims of official discrimination perpetrated by the state and county.    Census data show that the county's Hispanic population rose to more than two million in 1980, or 27.6% of the total population, while blacks comprised 12.4% and Asians and Pacific Islanders 5.8%. No Hispanic, black or Asian has ever been elected to the board in its 138-year history. Deane Dana, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, said the suit didn't come as a surprise, and said the board has retained lawyers to study the matter.    The suit seeks to invalidate the county's current election plan and devise one that complies with federal law. It is similar to one filed recently by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union. </TEXT></DOC>
