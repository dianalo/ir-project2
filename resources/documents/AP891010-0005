These Republican lawmakers _ who bristle at use of the term StarWars rather than the formal Strategic Defense Initiative _ say Bushmust act now as House and Senate negotiators thrash out the defensebudget for fiscal 1990.   ``We need them to weigh in on this conference,'' Sen. MalcolmWallop, R-Wyo., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,said in an interview last week.   ``The administration has to put a line in the sand on what isnot acceptable to them,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a memberof the House Armed Services Committee. ``Unless the administrationis willing to come out and do something, it's going to continue togo downhill.''   Star Wars, introduced six years ago by then-President Reagan asa nuclear-age antidote to a strike against the United States, hassuffered a series of blows in recent months.   In early August, the House slashed $1.8 billion from PresidentBush's request of $4.9 billion for the program in fiscal 1990. Thevote was 248-175, reflecting waning support for the program.   Last month Vice President Dan Quayle said the Reaganadministration's SDI ``astrodome'' approach to protect the UnitedStates was ``political jargon.'' Star Wars opponents cited thesecomments as an indication the administration does not have itsheart in the program; proponents say the vice president's remarkswere taken out of context.   Quayle recently has moved to emphasize his support for theprogram. In a Public Broadcasting System interview last weekend,the vice president urged Congress not to cut Star Wars funding.   Bush has said little about Star Wars, but Quayle insisted thepresident ``is a strong supporter of the Strategic DefenseInitiative.''   Last week the Senate slashed $900 million from Bush's proposal,but later reversed field and restored $600 million. That move wasviewed not as an increase in support for Star Wars but rather theSenate's attempt to strengthen its bargaining position with theHouse.   During negotiations, House conferees have pushed for a Star Warsbudget around $3.5 billion, far below the $4.1 billion spent on theprogram in fiscal 1989. The Senate has favored a total closer tothe $4.3 billion approved last week.   In the wake of these events, the Republican disenchantment showsup in various forms.   Wallop criticized the contact between the Pentagon and Congress,saying ``their congressional liaison is less than competent. They(the administration) are being told things that basically guidedthem elsewhere.''   ``The general tenor of their legislative liaison is to be asupporter once the crisis has arisen. Those of us trying to helphave been frustrated by that,'' the Wyoming Republican said.Pressed for specific names, Wallop declined to identify them.   John Dewey, who handles legislative issues for the SDIorganization at the Pentagon, said his office has been ``verysupportive, right along. We haven't given up _ by no means. Nobodyin our organization gives that impression.''   Another Pentagon official, who spoke on condition he not beidentified, said he was ``a little taken aback'' by the senator'scomments, and emphasized that ``we've worked the heck out of it andwill continue to.''   Wallop said this week would be an ideal time for theadministration to indicate the total fiscal 1990 budget it willaccept for Star Wars, and he expressed his confidence that a formerWyoming lawmaker, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, will make thatpoint clear.   ``It's hard to fight for people who don't have a target overwhich to fight,'' the senator said.   Another SDI supporter, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said he waslooking to Cheney and Quayle to keep the program highly visible.When asked if the administration has done enough to promote theprogram, Hyde, after a long pause, responded, ``probably not.''   ``Without administration support, the program will languish,''said Hyde, who fears a substantial budget cut would ``emasculate''the program.   Rep. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., a member of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, said he was not disappointed by the administration'sefforts on behalf of Star Wars, but said ``now is the time to weighin.''</TEXT></DOC>
