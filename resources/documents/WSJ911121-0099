Reps. Esteban Torres (D., Calif.) and Charles Schumer (D.,N.Y.) hope the House will pass their proposal in response toa Senate amendment that would place a 14% cap on credit cardinterest rates, which currently average 18.9%. A HouseBanking subcommittee, headed by Rep. Torres, was to meettoday to discuss credit card legislation, but Rep. Torressaid battles over other banking legislation have forced adelay, perhaps until tomorrow.</LP><TEXT>   It isn't clear that Reps. Torres and Schumer have thevotes to get their proposal out of the subcommittee. Bankers,retailers and the Bush administration say that any threat ofa rate cap could lead to a restriction of credit and disruptthe $60 billion market for debt backed by credit cardreceivables.   Under the proposal, if the General Accounting Office studyfound that rates don't respond to market forces, the GAOcould recommend that the president impose a cap on them. Thepresident would then have nine months to act.   The proposal also would require credit card issuers todisclose terms on the outside of solicitation envelopes.</TEXT></DOC>
