KISSEL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   No sirens. No flashing lights. No gunsor billy clubs. Just a notebook and a pen and an ear for popularmusic. These are the jukebox police.   They are undercover spies, actually, private citizens backed bycivil law. Their duty is to find people who make money from musicwithout paying rights fees to the artists and composers. Somepeople don't take them seriously until they find themselves incourt being sued for thousands of dollars.   ``They think you're kidding,'' says Andy Kropelak, anex-schoolteacher who patrols West Virginia and western Pennsylvaniafor Broadcast Music Inc. ``It's not a joke. It's not a scam.''   BMI and the American Society of Composers, Artists andPublishers are the principal enforcers of music copyright laws. Theorganizations collect license fees from establishments that usemusic in nearly every form _ whether it be a bar, a bank or abrothel.   ``They are not only the jukebox police, they are the licensersof music throughout an area,'' says Jonathan Zavin, a privatelawyer for BMI.   ``If it weren't for BMI or ASCAP, every bar and restaurant wouldhave to contact each songwriter individually to get permission toplay his music,'' Kropelak says.   For jukeboxes, the U.S. Copyright Office collects $63 forregistrations and splits the money among the composers andpublishers' agencies. In addition to its field representatives, BMIuses a network of people who log the songs they hear played on theubiquitous jukeboxes.   ``With 50 or so field men, whatever they can do is a drop in thebucket,'' says Ted Chapin, a lawyer for BMI in New York. ``Everycity, town and street corner has somebody using music. It's aquestion of having enough hands and feet to get there.''   One logger hit Joey's Bar and Grill in Charleston, W.Va., lastyear after a Steppenwolf fan dropped a few quarters in the jukeboxand played ``Born To Be Wild'' and ``Magic Carpet Ride.'' Acountry-and-western fan punched ``D-I-V-O-R-C-E'' and ``Rocky Top''and a nostalgic soul played ``Heartbreak Hotel'' and ``Wipeout.''   Unknown to owner Joseph Minardi, the BMI logger made a playlistthat became the basis for a federal court lawsuit. Minardi settledout of court for $12,000 in damages and attorneys' fees even thoughhe only leased the machine from a man who kept half the profits.   ``I didn't have any idea that a license was supposed to be onit,'' Minardi says. ``He made no mention that there had to be alicense on it.''   Minardi now has a current license for a new machine he purchasedhimself. A fully authorized version of ``She Drives Me Crazy'' byFine Young Cannibals was playing.   ``When I bought my own jukebox, they sent me information sayingthis machine had to be registered with BMI and all that,'' he says.``That was the first I'd heard of it.''   The suit was based on songs played before Minardi obtained hislicense. He says he forwarded cease-and-desist requests to theowner of the jukebox, who has since died.   BMI files up to 200 suits a year against bars, restaurants andnightclubs, generally seeking between $500 and $1,000 for each songtitle heard.   Four years ago, Ric Ocasek from The Cars, Bruce Springsteen andPrince took matters into their own hands, filing suit together tostop a southern West Virginia bar from playing their musicillegally.   ``We try to call and write and see them,'' Chapin says. ``Thesuit is only the last resort. We're not in the business of filingsuit. We're in the business of licensing music.''   Like Minardi, most violators succumb quietly, agreeing to payBMI a few thousand dollars for past violations and agreeing topurchase the $63 jukebox license.   Kropelak says he has often had trouble in West Virginia and hisboss, BMI general licensing vice president Tom Annastas, says it'sbecause many people resent being asked to pay for what they alreadyconsider theirs.   ``We've had our field representatives roughed up. Whenever yougo in some place and tell someone they have to pay for somethingthey don't feel they should have to pay for, they resent that,''Annastas says.   ``They've bought the disc jockey, they've bought the record orbought the tape, and you go in there and tell them they have to paysomething else.''   For that reason, BMI loggers ask to remain anonymous for fearbar owners will retaliate.   ``If they would just take care of business, I wouldn't have toworry about it,'' says the logger who busted Joey's. ``It shouldnever reach that point.''   The Joey's logger was a local musician who was upset that somepeople would use music for free. BMI officials say they look forother musicians to make the job as easy as possible.   ``The first criteria is their knowledge of music and theirability to recognize music, whether it be in a drugstore, anightclub or a skating rink,'' Siebel says. ``It's one thing tohe issue.The issue is, is industry willing to invest to makeit a good neighbor?''   Lusk cited Columbia Falls Aluminum Co. as a business that hasdone just that by installing new equipment to reduce emissions thatwere blamed for killing trees and slowing tree growth in the area.   But others believe a balance of development cannot _ or shouldnot _ be struck.   ``This area is not appropriate for many reasons _ foraesthetics, for wildlife, for destroying the qualities of whypeople want to come here or live here,'' says John Frederick of theNorth Fork Preservation Assocation, which filed legal challenges toboth Cenex wells proposed in the area.   Frederick lives in Polebridge, a tiny community five miles northof the well site. The preservation group he heads also has opposedthe British Columbia coal mine, some subdivision efforts andproposals to pave the dirt road that leads to Polebridge.   ``People don't come up here to see oil wells,'' Frederick said.   Another environmental group has targeted development in an areajust southeast of the park, where two companies have proposeddrilling test wells for oil and gas.   The proposals by Chevron and American Petrofina have beendelayed, however, while the Lewis and Clark National Forestprepares an environmental impact statement.   The wells are proposed in the Badger-Two Medicine region, a110,000-acre roadless area located just south of the park and neartwo wilderness areas.   The Badger-Two Medicine Alliance, seeking wilderness designationfor the area, has fought the drilling proposals. Alliance presidentLou Bruno feels development would damage the area severely.   But oil and gas industry officials maintain that development canoccur with little effect on the environment.   Keating noted that Cenex planned a number of precautions at itswell site, including measures to keep wildlife away from the siteand to protect the quality of surface water. Drilling also would belimited to certain times of the year, to avoid periods of eaglenesting and animal migration.   ``Historically, there are producing wells on college campuses,downtown business districts, in back yards,'' he says. ``They canbe made almost totally compatible with almost any environment.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
