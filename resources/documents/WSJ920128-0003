But not on Amtrak. He's a modern-day hobo -- when he'snot running his employment agency in Hermosa Beach.   &quot;Life is not nine-to-five]&quot; declares Mr. Loftus, or Danzo,as he prefers to be called when he's on the move. &quot;This is alife style] This is an attitude] This is a faith]&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Actually, it's a hobby among a bunch of people here who,in their own way, are trying to recreate some of the romanceof the rails.   There is a big difference between these weekend hobos andthe hobos of old. Consider the name of their group: BeverlyHills 'Bos. Their monthly meeting place: The bar of a ribjoint here called RJ's. Some have never actually ridden therails. Others just take part in an annual group ride. Butthere are also some members like Fred Libertore, a62-year-old painting contractor, who's called a &quot;bridger&quot;because he says he's been riding the rails long enough tohave jumped steam trains. &quot;I only ride 6,000 to 7,000 miles ayear now,&quot; he says.   Just after the Civil War, migrant workers carrying hoesacross their shoulders hopped trains from farm to farm. &quot;Hoeboys,&quot; they were called, homeless and proud of it. ClarkGable was a hobo for a time. So was Jack London, and SupremeCourt Justice William O. Douglas.   Nowadays, real hobos are generally a sadder lot, afflictedwith the same problems of mental illness, violence and drugabuse as the rest of America's homeless. &quot;This image ofsingle men heading out alone to confront the future is a myththat will not die. But I don't think many of the real hobosyou meet would strike you as lusty vagabonds,&quot; says TedConover, whose book &quot;Rolling Nowhere&quot; is a first-personaccount of riding the rails after college. He saysundocumented workers from Mexico are the real hobos now --&quot;the modern-day inheritants of the hobo tradition, riding thefreights to find work.&quot;   But like weekend hobbyists who restore and ride old steamtrains, the Beverly Hills 'Bos are connecting with an earliergeneration. They gather at RJ's over imported beer to swaptales of weekends spent dressing-down in faded Levis, plaidshirts and bandanas and hopping freight trains for a bit ofrecreational slumming. There are maybe 500 members of theBeverly Hills 'Bos, and about 50 of them show up every month.The only membership requirement is riding the rails -- orclaiming you have.   &quot;People do it for the challenge,&quot; says Warner Johnson, aretired stockbroker known by the group as Choo Choo, who'sdressed in a denim jacket covered with patches from thedozens of railroads he says he has ridden. &quot;You don't knowhow things are gonna work out, but things always do. That'sthe way hoboing works.&quot;   It's also great fun. &quot;My favorite ride, even though it isdangerous, is on the rear end of a load of lumber,&quot; Choo Choosays. &quot;You can sit on top, and you have a 360-degree view.&quot;The favorite part for Dr. Poet, a 42-year-old songwriternamed Kevin McKenna, is that &quot;the tracks show you people'sback yards. You see a different side of America.&quot;   These folks greet each other with a &quot;hobo handshake,&quot;pumping arms like a train's wheels and making hissing noisesto simulate air hoses breaking when boxcars separate. Andthey call each other by their &quot;road names,&quot; such as Santa FeBo, Tehachapi Bob and Klickety-Klack Klasten.   &quot;They call me 20th Century Fox. That's because I workthere,&quot; says Ellen Gameral, 49, manager of the studio'sscript library, who walks into the bar dressed in a blackblazer and skirt, clutching a Giorgio boutique shopping bag.She says she's never ridden the rails herself, but she comesto these gatherings because she likes meeting &quot;remarkablepeople.&quot; She's brought a potential new member tonight,Camellia Hudson. But Ms. Hudson seems confused. &quot;When I heardit was hobos, I thought it was an acronym for a professionalorganization,&quot; she says.   The group was started by Bobb Hopkins, or Santa Fe Bo, 44,whose acting credits include bit parts on &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;and &quot;Knight Rider,&quot; and his brother Chet (Hopalong) Hopkins,46, a one-time photographer of rock stars. They say theyjumped a freight in 1976 when they were broke and wanted toget to Boston for their grandfather's 90th birthday. They'vebeen hooked ever since. The brothers formed the National HoboAssociation for full- and part-time hobos in the late '70s,and started the Beverly Hills chapter about five years ago.   Santa Fe says he proposed to his wife, Northwest Nel, on amoonlit boxcar ride up the California coast. He once filmed ahobo documentary full of such tips as how to hop on a movingfreight (&quot;One mistake and you find out why so many hobos arecalled Shorty&quot;) and has written a screenplay called &quot;TheRestless Road.&quot;   One hazard is the &quot;bull,&quot; or railroad policeman who keepstransients away. Indeed, railroad executives find weekendhoboing sophomoric. &quot;They could get themselves killed,&quot; saysa not-amused Southern Pacific spokesman.   The National Hobo Association claims about 3,800 membersand even has its own newsletter, &quot;Hobo Times,&quot; put out everyother month by Los Angeles book publisher Garth (CaptainCook) Bishop, 55. It costs $18 a year, and despite thedelivery problems, Captain Cook swears it's read by realhobos, who pay just $6. It features pithy &quot;Hoboisms&quot; such as,&quot;When riding the rails, you're on hobo time, and every day'sa Friday afternoon.&quot;   That was penned by Itchy Foot Stetson (Bob Spediacci), 47,the head of a local courier service. He says he's been ridingthe rails for more than 15 years, with nothing standingbetween him and the elements but a foot-long hunting knife hecalls Duke. He doesn't use Duke in anger; it's perfect,however, for slicing carrots and onions to make big pots ofMulligan stew.   The stew is served at so-called &quot;hobojungle&quot; parties,beer-filled extravaganzas where the Beverly Hills 'Bos mix itup with full-time hobos at area rail yards. On a recentexcursion to the Santa Fe yard in Colton, Calif., a dozen'Bos are hanging out with a half-dozen real hobos, sharingstew and beer. Dr. Poet entertains with his guitar andhomespun lyrics: &quot;Some men sleep in beds. Some men sleeparound. But a hobo sleeps on the ground.&quot;   Tex (Cindy Freeling), 38, warms her gloved hands over acampfire and pulls her sporty black leather jacket tighter asshe tells the group about her maiden rail trip last year: the'Bos' annual group trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. &quot;I wason this grain car, and I took off my top and hung out thedoor to feel the wind,&quot; says Tex, an herbal nutritionist.   The real hobos appreciate the story, along with the beer,food and clothes that the 'Bos bring along. But the gulfbetween real and imagined is wide -- and apparent. On a carride from the rail yard, Dr. Poet is busy pitching screenplayideas. But a hobo named Kelly, who has neither a road namenor a secret handshake, competes by talking endlessly aboutswarms of bats attacking livestock in the desert.   The most recent member of the 'Bos is 84-year-old attorneyMelvin Belli, who says he qualifies because he workedundercover as a hobo for the Feds in 1933 to discover ifhobos were Bolshevists. (Nah, he decided.) At a boozyceremony at an Irish pub in San Francisco, where Mr. Belli isbeing inducted, a hulking, grizzled man suddenly staggers upto him.   &quot;I'm Road Hog, King of the Hobos, and I rode a freighttrain 260 miles down here to see Melvin Belli,&quot; he bellows.   &quot;Well,&quot; responds the King of Torts, &quot;I rode to the frontdoor in a Rolls Royce. I should be ashamed of myself.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
