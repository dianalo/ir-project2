Jean Pierson, chief executive officer, said the Europeanaircraft consortium plans to reduce the annual rate ofproduction of its wide-bodied A-300 and A-310 jets to 40 in1993 from 44 in 1992. Airbus Industrie also plans to cut backits production of single-aisle A-320 jets to 103 a year in1993 from 110 in 1992.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Pierson, speaking at a luncheon organized by theAnglo-American Press Association, confirmed that Airbus willshow a profit this year after repayments on its debt. Lastyear, the group reported its first operating surplus. Theofficial didn't give any figures for this year's earnings,except to say that the consortium expects to pay off between$700 million and $800 million of debt annually in the comingyears and that this will gradually eat into the group's debtload.   Aviation industry sources indicated that Airbus could showa profit of about $200 million this year.   Mr. Pierson said that in September 1990, Airbus chose notto increase production to 12 planes a month from 10. &quot;If wehad decided on 12,&quot; he said, &quot;we would be much worse offtoday.&quot;   Mr. Pierson noted that Boeing Co. of the U.S., Airbus'smain rival, earlier this year stepped up production of its737 jetliner to 21 a month, but then was forced recently toannounce it will cut back to 17 a month. McDonnell DouglasCorp. has similarly scaled back plans for airliner output.   Airbus is a consortium consisting of Aerospatiale ofFrance; Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., a unit of WestGermany's Daimler-Benz AG; British Aerospace PLC; andConstrucciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.</TEXT></DOC>
