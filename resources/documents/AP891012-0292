In a three-page letter sent Wednesday to Labor SecretaryElizabeth Dole, the union charged that the tax benefits of theproposed $6.75 billion buyout ``are effectively subsidizing asubstantial and excessive windfall'' to UAL Corp.'s management andUnited's pilots, the employee group spearheading the takeovereffort.   On Tuesday, United's pilots voted overwhelmingly to commit $200million from their $1.2 billion pension fund to buy preferred stockin an employee stock ownership plan.   The banks financing the deal wanted to see such a commitmentbefore providing financing for the takeover.   A group led by the pilots and UAL's management, with theparticipation of British Airways PLC, has offered to buy theChicago-based company for $300 a share in a tender offer thatexpires Oct. 26.   The pilots are the only UAL employee group so far committed toparticipating in the buyout. The machinists previously declaredtheir opposition to the plan and United's flight attendants arecontinuing to negotiate with UAL's management on contractconcessions in exchange for partial ownership of the company.   The deal also is being examined by the TransportationDepartment, which has expressed concern about leveraged buy-outsand foreign stakes in U.S. airlines.</TEXT></DOC>
