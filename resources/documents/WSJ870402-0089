But many traders view the dollar's upward potential as limited and are expecting it to head for new lows.    &quot;This is the biggest April Fool's joke of the week. . . . The dollar's going up,&quot; Ronald L. Sapiro, vice president and chief foreign exchange dealer at Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. in Chicago, said.    &quot;The prime rate did what all the central banks in the world couldn't,&quot; he said, referring to the efforts by the central banks of Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and the U.S. since March 24 to intervene in the foreign-exchange market in support of the dollar.    The Bank of Japan continued its intervention in Tokyo, buying an estimated $1.2 billion, traders said. But the dollar's strength was credited to the quarter-point increase in the prime rate of some major U.S. banks, to 7 3/4%, rather than to Japanese central bank action. Higher interest rates tend to make dollar-denominated investments more attractive.    But pessimism about the dollar's general outlook persisted yesterday. &quot;The dollar is out of intensive care but still on the critical list,&quot; Robert A. Brusca, senior vice president and chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International in New York, said. Its latest rise &quot;doesn't seem like anything spectacular to me,&quot; he said.    In late New York dealings, the dollar stood at 1.8305 West German marks, up 1.3% from 1.8063 Tuesday. The U.S. currency also climbed 0.9% to 147.17 Japanese yen from 145.83.    The dollar was quoted at 147.65 yen in early Tokyo trading Thursday.    The British pound fell 0.9% to $1.5915 from $1.6064. Traders said the pound was unaffected by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's remark in London that he wants to keep the currency's value at about $1.60 and about 2.90 West German marks. He said the government would use interest-rate moves and market intervention to maintain those rates. The pound climbed yesterday to 2.9132 marks from 2.9016.    Previously, the official, whose job is equivalent to Treasury secretary in the U.S., had argued that disclosing exchange-rate targets would encourage speculation and might make target rates more difficult to maintain.    In the U.S., some traders noted that the rise in the prime rate, or base rate for corporate loans, followed increases in other U.S. interest rates in recent weeks. Yesterday, U.S. bond prices rose, pushing interest rates lower, which would tend to weaken the dollar.    At a news conference in Tokyo, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita reiterated that the bank will continue to intervene and will take other &quot;appropriate&quot; steps in concert with other major central banks to stabilize the value of the yen.    Meanwhile, the Japanese Finance Ministry disclosed yesterday that the nation's reserves of gold, convertible foreign currencies and special drawing rights, which are units based on a multinational basket of currencies, surged $6.66 billion in March to $58.39 billion. It indicated that the rise was due to the Bank of Japan's intervention in the currency market.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery was unchanged at $418 in moderate trading estimated at 2.5 million ounces.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Wednesday, April 1, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
