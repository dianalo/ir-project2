Texas Air, the nation's largest airline holding company withabout 20 percent of the market, is the parent of Eastern andContinental. Its overall loss of $124.3 million widened from a$100.7 million loss in the first three months of 1987.   The latest loss occurred despite an increase in revenue, to$2.13 billion from $2.04 billion in the year-earlier quarter.   Texas Air attributed the losses at Miami-based Eastern to a``crippling'' campaign being waged by the Eastern pilots andmachinists unions against the carrier.   Eastern and Texas Air sued the two unions Friday for $1.5billion, accusing them of ``Eastern bashing'' to drive down theairline's value so they could buy it cheaply.   Eastern posted a net loss of $31 million for the first quarter,compared with net income of $2.1 million a year earlier. Revenuedeclined to $1.1 billion from $1.2 billion.   The company said Houston-based Continental's losses were causedby bad weather and the costs of integrating the airline into theparent, which had also been problems in late 1987.   Continental recorded a first-quarter loss of $80.6 million onrevenue of $1.1 billion, narrowed from a loss of $97.9 million onrevenue of $900 million.   Continental's earnings for first-quarter 1987 were restated toinclude the results for People Express, New York Air and RockyMountain Airways, which Continental purchased from Texas Air inApril 1987.   ``The losses reported by both (Eastern and Continental) areclose to our expectations and reflect the unusual operatingenvironments which each airline faces at this time,'' Texas Airspokesman Bruce Hicks said.   He said Continental experienced a difficult first quarter butended the period ``on a positive and profitable note.''   Improving fare levels, operating performances and generallypositive traffic trends are producing a marked change inContinental's financial performance, Hicks said.   At Eastern, ``aggressive'' cost control and the elimination ofnon-economic services helped reduce the first-quarter loss from thelevel of losses incurred in the second half of 1987, Texas Air said.   Texas Air officials have blamed the pilots and machinists unionsat Eastern for the current investigations of both big Texas Aircarriers by the Department of Transportation and the FederalAviation Administration.   The investigations have turned up no major safety flaws in theplanes.   Hicks said the past several weeks have been ``most difficult andchallenging'' because of the investigations.   ``We strongly believe that Texas Air and its airlines willemerge from this process with renewed confirmation of ourobjectives,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
