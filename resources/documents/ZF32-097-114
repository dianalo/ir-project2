Change your prompts; you're already a nerd, so youmight as well have a cute prompt. (Micro Mephisto) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Jillette, Penn.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT>Feature:   illustrationcartoon.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The above is the first three lines of my AUTOEXEC.BAT file.andP;  One of mybuddies is a really smart person.andP;  No doubt you have friends that are reallysmart people.andP;  You probably are a really smart person.andP;  But this person is areally really smart person.andP;  He has patents and stuff.andP;  He never has to writedown phone numbers.andP;  There's a NASA shuttle that, if it ever goes up, willhave an experiment on it that he designed while he was still in college.andP;  Butthe thing he knows most about is computer science.andP;  He doesn't even touch aPC-he writes his lecture notes on a Cray.andP;  He can spell-check the Mahabharatain a minute and a half with his own software.andM;He was over at my apartment and had to use my computer to call his office.andO;He looked at the prompt on my machine: C:\) S'up?andM;&quot;Oh, you have a cute prompt.andP;  That's a really nerd thing to do.&quot;andM;Now, this is being said to me by a man wearing a button-down shirt and aDustin Hoffman haircut.andP;  Granted, he doesn't have a pocket protector, and Ihave seen him with dates who seemed to enjoy his company.andP;  I'll give you thathe knows movies (he was wrong about Jesus of Montreal and Darkman, but wepretty much agree on everything else) and music (Elvis Costello and theBuzzcocks, especially).andP;  But even if he gets more tattoos than Axl Rose andstarts doing &quot;Club MTV'dancers two at a time, he's still a nerd.andP;  He just is.andM;Another good friend is at the MIT Media Lab.andP;  He works in the &quot;snake pit&quot;with virtual reality.andP;  Whenever I introduce him to someone, he points to hiswatch and says, &quot;It's analog, not digital.andP;  I'm not a nerd.&quot; (Is there ahuman being who uses the word analog who's not a nerd? If there is, I'llnever meet him.) It seems I only know nerds.andM;I know nerds who claim not to be nerds because they scuba dive, and they letyou know that light away.andP;  Well, yeah, scuba is a sport, but it's a sportwith lots of dials and math.andP;  It's a nerd sport.andM;It seems like one of the things that makes someone a nerd is having a list atone's fingertips of the reasons one isn't a nerd.andP;  I'm sure some have listsin SideKick note files of reasons they're not nerds-C:\side\nerd-me.no !andO;Methinks they protest too much.andP;  If you asked Billy Idol, &quot;Are you a nerd?,&quot;andO;you wouldn't get an instant response.andP;  Mr. Idol would have to think about it,and I bet when Billy thinks about anything it takes a little while.andM;You realize by now that this is the pot rejoicing in the blackness of allstove-top utensils.andP;  I'm a nerd.andP;  When I was asked to write articles forPC/Computing, I jumped at the chance.andP;  QED.andM;And you, I don't care where you're reading this magazine.andP;  I don't care ifyou're sitting backstage at the Cat Club in New York City with a cigarettehanging out of your mouth or in the sleeper compartment of a Peterbilt trucklistening to Eddie Rabbit-you're a nerd.andP;  And what the hell is wrong withthat? If Hitler hadn't gotten the nerds fighting mad, we might all becelebrating the reunification of Cleveland this year.andM;So here's my point: Bikers do biker things, and Penthouse Pets do PenthousePet things (but not with us).andP;  We're all nerds and we all do nerd things.andO;So, go ahead, change your prompt, right now, and make it something that youthink is really hip and not nerdish at all ...andP;  Prove you're a nerd.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
