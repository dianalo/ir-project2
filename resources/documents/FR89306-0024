(B) Unless otherwise established by the debt instrument, regular paymentsfor amorized loans will be applied first to interest accrued as of thedate of receipt of the payment, with any excess being applied to principal.For debt instruments with installments of principal plus interest, regularpayments will be applied first to the interest due through the date ofthe next scheduled installment of principal and interest and then to principaldue, with any balance applied to the next scheduled principal installment.  (ii) Extra payments are derived from sale of basic chattel or real estatesecurity; refund of unused loan funds; cash proceeds of property insuranceas provided in andSection; 1806.5(b) of Subpart A of Part 1806 (paragraphV B of FmHA Instruction 426.1); and similar actions which reduce the valueof basic security.

Any balance will beapplied to other FmHA loans in ascending order of priority.(B) For amortized loans, extra payments will be applied first to interestaccrued to the date payment is received, and then to principal. For debtinstruments with installments of principal plus interest, such paymentswill be applied to the final unpaid principal installment.(b) <T3>Loan summary statements. </T3>Upon request of a borrower, FmHA willissue a loan summary statement showing account activity for each loan madeor insured under the CONACT. Field offices will post a notice informingborrowers of the availability of loan summary statements.

These statements reflect cumulative data from the beginningof the current year through the end of the most recent quarter. Servicingoffices may request copies of these quarterly or annual statements by sendingFmHA 1951-57, ``Request for Loan Summary Statement,'' to the Finance Office.(3) The servicing office will provide a copy of the applicable loan summarystatement to the borrower on request. If requested, the servicing officewill also provide an explanation of the application of payments.(4) When a copy of the form is requested, borrowers will be provided withcopies of the applicable form(s). A printout obtained through ADPS reflectingall future installments owed will be attached. These two documents willconstitute the loan summary statement to be provided to the borrower.(c) <T3>Insurance. </T3>FmHA borrowers shall maintain insurance coverage asfollows:(1) Community and Insured Business Programs borrowers shall continuouslymaintain adequate insurance coverage as required by the loan agreementand andSection; 1942.17(j)(3) of Subpart A of Part 1942 of this chapter.Insurance coverage must be monitored in accordance with the above-referencedsection to determine that adequate policies and bonds are in force.(2) For all other types of loans covered by this subpart, property insurancewill be serviced according to Subpart A of Part 1806 of this chapter (FmHAInstruction 426.1) in real estate mortgage cases, and according to theloan agreement in other cases.(d) <T3>Property taxes. </T3>Real property taxes are serviced accordingly toPart 1863 of this chapter.

The State Directormust determine that authorizing a protective advance is in the best interestof the government. For insurance, factors such as the amount of advance,occupancy of the structure, vulnerability to damage and present value ofthe structure and contents will be considered.(2) Protective advances are considered due and payable when advanced. Advancesbear interest at the rate specified in the most recent debt instrumentauthorizing such an advance.(3) Protective advances are not to be used as a substitute for a loan.(4) Vouchers are prepared in accordance with applicable procedures setforth in FmHA Instructions 2024-A and 2024-P (available in any FmHA office).(f) <T3>Subordination of security. </T3>When a borrower requests FmHA to subordinatea security instrument so that another creditor or lender can refinance,extend, reamortize, or increase the amount of a prior lien; be on paritywith; or place a lien ahead of the FmHA lien, it will submit a writtenrequest to the servicing office as provided below.

(x) Necessary consent and subordination of all other outstanding securityinterests must be obtained.  (xi) For Indian Tribes and Tribal Corporations, loan funds will not beused for any purpose that will contribute to excessive erosion of highlyerodible land or to the conversion of wetlands to produce an agriculturalcommodity as further explained in Exhibit M of Subpart G of Part 1940 ofthis chapter. This requirement will be monitored throughout the term ofthe loan.  (2) <T3>Authorities</T3>. Proposals not meeting one or more of the above requirementswill be submitted to the Administrator, Attention (appropriate programdivision) for prior concurrence. All other proposals may be approved bythe official with loan approval authority under Subpart A of Part 1901of this chapter. (3) <T3>Processing.</T3> The case file is to include: (i) The borrower's written request on Form FmHA 465-1, ``Application forPartial Release, Subordination or Consent,'' if appropriate, or in otheracceptable format. The request must contain the purpose of the subordination;exact amount of money or property involved; description of security propertyinvolved; type of security instrument; name, address, line of businessand other general information pertaining to the party in favor of whichthe request is made; and other pertinent information to evaluate the needfor the request;  (ii) Current balance sheet;  (iii) If development work is involved, an operating budget on Form FmHA442-7, ``Operating Budget,'' or similar form which projects income andexpenses through the first full year of operation following completionof planned improvements; or if no development work is involved, an incomestatement and budget on Form FmHA 442-2, ``Statement of Budget, Income,and Equity,'' schedules 1 and 2, or similar form;  (iv) Copy of proposed security instrument;  (v) Appraisal report, when applicable;  (vi) OGC opinion on the request;  (vii) Exhibit A of this subpart (available in any FmHA office), appropriatelycompleted;  (viii) Appropriate environmental review; and  (ix) Any other necessary supporting information.(4) <T3>Closing. </T3>All requests for subordination will be closed accordingto instructions from the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) except thosewhich affect only chattel liens other than pledges of revenue.

(2) <T3>Requests Requiring National Office Approval. </T3>Reamortization requestsnot meeting the above requirements may be reamortized with prior approvalof the National Office. Requests forwarded to the National Office willcontain the case file, including: (i) Current budget and cash flow prepared on Form FmHA 442-2, schedules1 and 2, or similar form; (ii) Current balance sheet; (iii) Current income statement; (iv) Exhibit A of this subpart, appropriately completed; (v) form FmHA 1951-33, ``Reamortization Request,'' completed in accordancewith andSection;1951.207(g)(3)(i) of this subpart, when applicable; and (vi) Any other necessary supporting information. (3) <T3>Processing. </T3>(i) Reamortization of loans secured by notes and mortgageswill be accomplished through the use of a new evidence of debt unless OGCrecommends that the terms of the existing document be modified throughthe use of Form FmHA 1951-33, if legally adequate, or otherwise throughthe use of another appropriate form. Ordinarily the entire note, includingprincipal and interest, is reamortized. Accrued interest will be at theoriginal rate. (ii) Loans secured by bonds or notes with other than real or chattel securitypledged to FmHA may be reamortized using procedures which are acceptableto the State Director and legally permissible under State statutes in theopinion of the borrower's counsel and the OGC. The procedure may includea new debt instrument or agreement for the total FmHA indebtedness includingthe delinquency, or a new debt instrument or agreement whereby the borroweragrees to repay the delinquency plus interest at the original bond rateover an established period. When reamortization of a delinquent or problemloan secured by a bond cannot be perfected by issuing a new debt instrumentdue to State statutes, or the cost of preparation and closing is prohibitive,a rescheduling agreement, Exhibit H of this subpart (available in any FmHAoffice), may be used. When legally permissible and administratively acceptable,the total outstanding principal and interest balances should be reamortizedrather than only the delinquent amount. (iii) When a new debt instrument or agreement for only the delinquencyis used, a copy will be sent to the Finance Office after execution. Incases where serial bonds are used as evidence of security, the originalserial bond(s) will be submitted to the Finance Office. A new loan numberwill be assigned to the amortized delinquent amount. The borrower willbe required to pay the amount due on the amortized delinquent amount plusregular scheduled installments on the loan. Section 1942.19 of subpartA of Part 1942 of this chapter applies to any new bonds issued unless precludedby State statutes or an exception is approved by the National Office. Theagreement will contain: (A) The amount delinquent, which must equal the total delinquency on theaccount, the unpaid principal on any advance, and the accrued intereston any advance through the date of reamortization, less interest paymentscredited on the advance account; (B) The effective date of the reamortization; (C) The number of years over which the delinquency will be amortized; (D) The repayment schedule; and (E) The interest rate. (iv) When a new instrument or endorsement is executed, an amortized paymentor principal and interest payment closely approximating equal installmentsof principal and interest will be due on the next scheduled due date. Defermentof interest and/or principal payments is not authorized. New instrumentsor endorsements are handled as follows: (A) <T3>Notes and endorsements. </T3>The original of a new note, or any endorsementrequired by OGC, is to be attached to the existing note, filed in the servicingoffice, and retained by FmHA until the account is paid in full or otherwisesatisfied. A copy will be forwarded to the Finance Office. (B) <T3>Bonds. </T3>Since State statutes vary regarding reamortization of bonds,each State Office will work closely with OGC when bonds are involved. IfState statutes do not require the release of existing bonds, they willbe retained with the new bond instrument or agreement in the FmHA officeauthorized to store such documents.
