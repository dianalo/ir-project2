Earlier this week, a Wall Street source said Marriott had been working with the Pritzker family of Chicago to arrange financing for such a purchase. Other sources said that Marriott and the Pritzker interests might want to split up the Westin and Hilton International hotel assets of Allegis and sell its United Airlines and Hertz rental-car units.    &quot;We are always looking and we are always interested in opportunities,&quot; the Marriott spokesman said. He added that Marriott &quot;could be interested, or would be interested&quot; in the Allegis hotel assets &quot;under the right circumstances.&quot; Marriott, a lodging, restaurant and food-service concern, has an announced goal of 20% average annual growth for the next five years.    Earlier this month, directors of Allegis said they planned to sell the hotel and rental-car units to refocus on the airline. Allegis has been under pressure from an investor group to break up the airline. </TEXT></DOC>
