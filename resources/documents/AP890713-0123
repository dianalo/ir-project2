The attack occurred shortly after midnight at La Ceiba, more than200 miles north of Tegucigalpa, U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles V.Barclay said in a telephone interview. There was no claim ofresponsibility.   It was the fourth attack on U.S. soldiers in Honduras since Feb.1. Three soldiers were injured in the previous incidents.   Today's victims were Army military police, who were in La Ceibato act as escorts for about 150 American soldiers taking part in ajoint road-building exercise with Honduran troops, Barclay said. Hesaid the entire group was due to leave La Ceiba today.   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Bouchersaid the explosive was thrown as the Americans left a disco. Barclaycould not confirm that.   ``We don't know if the explosive device was hurled from a passingautomobile or had been detonated in place,'' Barclay said. He saidthe device exploded outside a discotheque.   The injured soldiers were part of a group of nine who had beengiven a night's leave and were in civilian clothes. Two uninjuredsoldiers fled and were arrested by Honduran troops because they hadno identification, a Honduran military commander said.   Barclay said three of the wounded soldiers were in seriouscondition, while the other four suffered lesser injuries. He saidall were assigned to the Enrique Soto Cano Air Base, 50 milesnortheast of Tegucigalpa, a major center for U.S. troops in Honduras.   The wounded soldiers were rushed to a private hospital in LaCeiba, Barclay said. Their names were not released.   Col. Eric Sanchez said the uninjured Americans were being helduntil they could be officially identified by U.S. officials.   Sanchez, the Honduran military commander at La Ceiba, said theattack occurred at 12:30 a.m. and involved a ``homemade explosivedevice.''   Barclay said the troops were part of a convoy that had beenbuilding roads in a province 120 miles east of La Ceiba. The convoyhad stopped for the night during its trip back to Soto Cano.   About 15,000 American troops and Honduran soldiers were takingpart in an exercise called Strong Roads that began in December andended Tuesday. The exercise involved bringing in troops from theUnited States a few hundred at a time for road-building.   At least 20 American soldiers have been wounded in attacks inHonduras since 1982, when the United States started increasing itsmilitary presence in this country and holding joint exercises withHonduran troops.   Today's attack came three months after unidentified assailantsused gunfire and an explosive to attack a jeep convoy carrying 11U.S. and six Honduran soldiers outside Olanchita, near La Ceiba.   One jeep was disabled in the April 11 attack, but no injurieswere reported.   A shadowy leftist group calling itself the Morazanista NationalLiberation Front claimed responsibility for the attacks earlier thisyear and for attacks in 1983 and 1987.   Since 1982, the United States and Honduras have carried outaround 80 military exercises jointly, involving a total of 100,000American soldiers, under a 1954 reciprocal military assistancetreaty.   The exercises were intended partly as a political signal to theleftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua, which borders Hondurasto the south.   Some elements of the Honduran population strongly resent theincreased U.S. military role in the Central American nation, as wellas the use of Honduran territory by the Contra rebels battling theleftist government in Managua.   Honduras was used by the U.S.-supported Contras in their attackson Sandinista forces. U.S. military aid to the Contras was cut offabout 17 months ago, and U.S. assistance to the Contras has beenlimited to humanitarian aid.   Thousands of Contras still live in the border area, but fightinghas declined substantially as a result of a cease-fire agreed to inMarch 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
