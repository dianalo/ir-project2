We calculate the effects of lens aberrationson the focusing strength of the lens and on the dilution of the beam'sphase space. From this we derive the minimum spot size achievable usinga bi-Gaussian beam and, after inclusion of the beam-beam pinch effect,the luminosity enhancement that can be gained in principle. We estimatethe luminosity enhancement in the case of SLAC Linear Collider beam designparameters, and discuss limitations and possible improvements in plasma-lensperformance.</TEXT></DOC>
