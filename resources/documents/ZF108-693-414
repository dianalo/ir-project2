How frequently have you used a rollback logfile to recover from an error? And what use have you found for structuredquery language in your daily use of PC database products?andM;Probably not a lot! Many networked users of PC database products have neverencountered the strict data integrity and security rules that are commonplacein the more heavyweight relational database management systems used withminicomputers and mainframes.andM;PC User has spent much of the last month exploring new territory - that ofthe Oracle Relational Database Server for OS/2.andM;This is the territory where, allegedly, 'the best of both the PC and theminicomputer/mainframe worlds' can be made available in a PC-usingenvironment.andP;  Briefly stated, those benefits are, from the PC world, vastlyenhanced personal productivity; from the large systems domain, enhancedreliability, integrity and maintainability; and from the combination of both,horizontal and vertical scaling to gain maximum computing power for minimumextra outlay.andM;We've installed the Oracle Server for OS/2 on a Compaq 486/25 and connectedit to our existing Novell NetWare 2.15 Ethernet network.andP;  We're now in theearly stages of using the server with three front-end options: Oracle's ownclient tools, DataEase 4.2 for SQL and Paradox with SQL connectivity.andP;  Inthis article we'll concentrate on the background to this necessary shift inPC computing, installation of Oracle OS/2 server, and access to it throughthe DataEase and Paradox Client front-ends.andP;  Client-server architecture Itall began a couple of years ago, when Microsoft's Bill Gates andAshton-Tate's Ed Esber shared a Comdex platform to jointly extol the virtuesof what was then the Microsoft-Ashton-Tate SQL Server.andM;The message was simple enough: PC LANs are running out of bandwidth becausenetwork fileservers are merely storage and communications devices and don'tdo any real work.andP;  Every query against a database held on a fileserver isactually processed at the client workstation, and every single databaserecord has to travel up the network cable, into the networked PC's memory,before the answer can be produced.andM;Under the PC regime the only processing power available to its user is theprocessor inside the PC.andP;  In the client-server architecture though, PC userscan use not only their own machine's processing power, but also the poweravailable in 'compute server' machines anywhere else on the network.andP;  Thesemay contain specialist number-crunching processors and software (for example,transputers), or, as in this review, specialist database processing software.andM;From now on, this review win refer to client workstations, or sometimes justclients.andP;  And we'll talk about fileservers when we mean the data store andcommunications machine on a network, but about database servers when we meana compute platform being used to provide a dedicated database processingresource.andM;To achieve a client-server relationship it's not enough to have just ahardware split: the software too must be distributed, some running on theclient, and some on the server.andM;in the database environment, the client software (known as the front-end)presents and manipulates data on the PC workstation - just like a PC - andthe server software, the 'back-end' or 'engine' stores, retrieves (processes)and protects data.andM;You've probably spotted the missing link: how do the client and the servercommunicate with each other, and how do users  programmers) obtain the datarequired at the workstation?andM;Communications are handled by an additional protocol, running on top of thenetwork software, by which the database client and server recognize eachother's messages.andP;  Processing is initiated using a language known as SQL(Structured Query Language), which is normally embedded within applicationsby programmers, but can be used in command fine mode from the workstation.andM;As PCs get more and more powerful, hardware vendors like Compaq and IBM havesuccumbed to the temptation to lend credibility to the  mainframe on yourdesk' marketing slogans of the clone 386 and 486 vendors, and the idea thatcompanies will be tempted to consider these machines for applicationsinvolving ever more users, and ever more valuable and critical data.andM;However, in the opinion of most heavy-weight software vendors, includingOracle, the current fileserver software and architecture paradigms fornetworked database software are useless for the kind of serious, heavyweightapplications that the hardware platforms now claim to be capable ofsupporting.andM;Not only do current PC database products ignore the industry standard way ofmanaging and manipulating data (SQL), they're simply not tolerant enough ofhardware failures and software glitches, don't protect data stringentlyenough, and don't enforce the data integrity and security required by DPdepartments.andM;Companies like Oracle, Ingres and Infomix, long used to the stringency ofdata integrity requirements of their thousands of mini and mainframecorporate users, are already sensing the opportunity to sell to customerswith power PC platforms.andP;  At the other end of the scale, PC database softwarevendors such as Borland, Ashton-Tate, Gupta Technologies and Sapphire mightface the prospect of a potentially large software market for high performancePC applications disappearing from under their noses into the arms of Oracleand the like.andM;It won't, however, be an overnight upheaval, even though, two years on fromthat Gates/Esber honeymoon, the database server/SQL paradigm shift isprobably the most significant earthquake in the PC market ever.andP;  We're stillonly in the introductory phase of workstation-based SQL Server products,There are less than 200 sites using PC-hosted database servers on PC LANs inthe UK.andP;  In the interim, the would-be vendors of such software have learnedmore about what this mainframe paradigm is really about, as the potentialuser base has, too.andM;SQL surveyandM;The result is that the original, much-vaunted benefits of reduced networktraffic have become less important than other benefits to the user community.andO;To support that assertion, we quote from a recent unpublished survey bySapphire, UK distributors of DataEase: network bandwidth bottlenecks arecited as a relatively low-grade reason for the interest of their clients inPC client-server database architectures.andP;  The SQL sung is an extract (bypermission) of those results.andP;  The question asked was &quot;What do you considerto be the main benefits of an SQL-based distributed information managementsystem?&quot;andM;What emerges clearly from another part of the Sapphire survey is that over 90per cent of the corporate customers questioned have got at least as Ear as aninitial investigation of SQL-based distributed information systems, and over30 per cent are now fully committed to their implementation.andP;  Where serverproducts were being considered, at least 50 per cent of those questioned werelooking at other than PC-based server products, with IBM OS/2 ExtendedEdition being the most popular PC server product, followed by Oracle Serverfor OS/2 and Microsoft SQL Server.andM;The core architecture of the fault-tolerant RDBMS is a client-server model,where the database is held on one or more database server computers, underthe charge of a database administrator (DBA), and users run theirapplications from client hardware (already known as the networked PC).andM;There won't be an early proliferation of database servers to choose from.andO;These are heavyweight software items, and can't be conjured up in a couple ofyears or less, like an ordinary off-the-shelf PC application.andP;  That's whyMicrosoft, and more recently Lotus, decided to buy in the technology byinvesting in a minicomputer software company, SyBase, to get their PCdatabase server products off the ground.andM;Networked database choiceandM;There are effectively only four choices for the PC database administrator whodecides it's time to get serious about networked database applications byadding a database server to the network.andP;  The four are: Microsoft SQL Server1.0, IBM OS/2 Extended Edition Database Manager 1.andP;  2, Gupta SQLBase Server3.6 V, and Oracle OS/2 Server 6.0.andP;  A fifth option, NetWareSQL from Novell,is probably a non-starter: Novell recently bought a 20 per cent stake inGupta Technologies and is committed to producing a NetWare386 version ofGupta SQLBase.andM;just a look at the version numbers tells you a lot about pedigrees.andP;  Oraclehas been in the SQL server business since 1977, long before the PC was even atwinkle in IBM's corporate eye.andP;  Oracle is very proud of the fact that itsrelational  database  management  systems (RDBMS) are available on more than80 industry  standard platforms,  and  in  the minicomputer marketplace it'sundoubtedly an industry standard.andM;In the PC world, however, that's far from the case - dbase, DataEase,Paradox, Revelation and many others all have many more users than Oracle onstrictly PC networks.andP;  And in sites where there are years of experience and ahigh degree of comfort with the different interfaces of the differentproducts, it's of vital importance that a decision to move to a databaseserver environment doesn't require a change in user interface for tens, evenhundreds of users.andM;So even if the Oracle back-end appears to be the most sensible choice,database administrators will want to be reassured that a familiar front-endapplication is available which makes migration to the client-serverenvironment as painless as possible.andP;  We used Oracle's own client tools forapplications building and SQL manipulation, and they'd be ideal for siteswhich already have experience of oracle on other platforms restricted toASCII character interfaces.andP;  But there's little doubt that PC sites 'movingup' to Oracle would find it hard to be over polite about Oracle's current PCclient offerings.andP;  The major change will come when Oracle ships its Windows3.0 tools, possibly as early as this autumn.andM;The Software components box fists aU the software products used in the courseof this review.andP;  There are two most likely scenarios where migration to a PCenvironment running a client-server architecture for RDBMS applications willbe appropriate: one for those coming down, another for those going up.andP;  By'coming down' we mean migrating or expanding  applications  currently  run on minicomputer or mainframe servers, with ASCII client terminals, to PCplatform servers with PC client workstations.andM;Going up', on the other hand, describes the range of choices which mightbegin with an upgrade from a PC network fileserver RDBMS (today's norm for aPC database environment), and end with multiple server hosts including PC,minicomputer and mainframe stores on the same network.andP;  This review iswritten from the  going up' standpoint and aims to answer one main question:will moving from file to database server architecture require massivestructural changes to an installed base of typical PC database softwareusers?andM;Make no mistake: the back-end server products require large, well-stacked PCmachines.andP;  Oracle Server 6.0 for OS/2 requires 10Mb RAM in a 486 machine suchas the Compaq 486/2 5 used in this review, and prefers that machine to bededicated solely to the task of serving database clients.andM;In fact, you can run Oracle Server 6.0 in one OS/2 session while using the486 machine as both an SQL client and a general purpose personal productivityPC.andP;  As a result of our tests, we have to conclude that if you were to decidethat's a good idea, then you probably don't need to switch from fileservingto database serving anyway, especially when the change-over is going to costyou several tens of thousands of pounds just in hardware, and software, letalone training and administration costs.andP;  Some sample comparison timings,showing the difference between the same queries running under a fileserverand the database server architectures, are given in the Benchmark Resultsbox.andM;InstallationandM;We now come to installation.andP;  First take your database server hardware.andP;  Inour case, this is a Compaq 486/25 machine configured with 8Mb memory and a300Mb hard disk.andP;  On the Oracle SQL Server packaging, 8Mb is recommended, butOracle contacted us to say it now recommended 10MB.andP;  The amount of memoryused really depends on the number of workstations using the database server.andO;Since in our case the maximum number of stations was at the low end of thelikely spectrum (six), we doubt that the missing 2Mb is significant.andM;The database server computer 486/25) needs to be added to an existingnetwork: we added a Novell NE 2000 interface card to the bus, and sited theCompaq in a convenient corner and inserted it into the Ethernet chain.andP;  Thepositioning of a database server machine with respect to other workstationsand servers (file or database) isn't critical.andP;  Included in both the serverand client software is another layer of communications protocols, loaded intomemory on top of the underlying (in this case) Novell SPX/IPX drivers, which'listen' to the network traffic for packets of data uniquely identified asSQL commands, queries or SQL-derived data transmissions.andM;The Oracle Server is an OS/2 product: the database server machine needs to berunning OS/2 1.0 or higher.andP;  In our case, we used Compaq's OS/2 1.10.andO;Software installation requires the installation of additional directories inthe NetWare fileserver to deal with the OS/2 requested.andM;The Netware for the OS/2 requestor pack that's supplied by Novell includes authe necessary software, and an installation routine which takes over afterthe network administrator has manually created an OS/2 subdirectory in eachof the SYS:LOGIN and SYS:PUBLIC directories.andM;The next step is to install the OS/2 requestor itself on the database server,a prompted, straightforward procedure.andP;  Your CONFIG.SYS must be editedmanually to include the correct driver for the network interface card chosen.andO;Rebooting the database server implements the network connection, and afterlogging in, the database server is ready for the next stage of the Oracle SQLServer installation process: installing the server software itself.andM;Before that though, it's worth noting the confusion that can arise if yournetwork has hitherto been a DOS-only network, and you're being draggedscreaming into the OS/2 world only because you need an OS/2 workstationbefore you can turn it into an SQL database server.andP;  It was about half a daybefore I got used to switching between the DOS client and the OS/2workstation for this review.andM;You must first be logged into the network, which you can do from any OS/2session prompt.andP;  (Each log-in will be regarded as a separate log-in byNetWare - as if it came from a different workstation.) This proved usefulwhen it came to running tests.andM;Next, install the Oracle server software.andP;  This is supplied in a large box,and Oracle must do something about the way the floppy disks are packaged.andO;Within minutes, the cardboard flaps designed to hold them in place hadcollapsed, and managing the two-dozen or so disks became a nightmare.andM;Fortunately, there was no reason to feel intimidated, The Oracle manuals,which are voluminous, provide a clear set of instructions, and to my surpriseit turned out not to be the ordeal I was anticipating.andP;  Instead, I dumbly feddisks into the machine as requested, and within about 20 minutes it was done.andO;To start up the database itself you use the command:andM;SQLDBA  STARTUP  AUTHORIZATION= [PASSWORD]andM;From the OS/2 command fine, a second command:andM;SPXSRV OSERVandM;starts up the listening device which monitors network traffic for connectionrequests to the server from client applications.andP;  The database servercomputer doesn't need to be physically dedicated to its Oracle function.andP;  Iwas able to Ctrl Esc out of the server session and use other sessions,including the real mode DOS box, concurrently.andP;  on a large network, with manysimultaneous users, that might not be such a good idea: each installation'sadministrator can make his or her own decisions about whether to use thedatabase server as a workstation as well.andM;To access the database server from network workstations the appropriatesoftware then needs to be installed on each workstation in turn.andP;  Again, aninstallation procedure is on hand: feed the disks into each workstation andanswer the prompts.andM;Before taking delivery of the software you should check whether or not thePCs you plan to use as client workstations have been passed as 'Oracle fit'by the company's machine certification program.andP;  The client install routinesask you to indicate which machine you're running on.andP;  My Mission Technologies386,/16 (a badged ALR computer) didn't figure on the list.andP;  This meant theBIOS didn't always react as expected to some of the calls from the Oracleprotected mode memory manager.andP;  These problems occurred in both the commandline utilities and through SQL Forms and other Oracle applications tools.andM;I kept the Oracle hotline support staff busy for several hours with a varietyof questions and problems.andP;  Oracle runs a two-tier support system in the UK.andO;A first-line group handles the less difficult questions instantly.andP;  Thosethat can't be dealt with immediately get passed on to a second line group.andM;The support staff were first rate.andP;  Not only did they come up with answers toproblems relating specifically to the operation and administration of theOracle software: they were also prepared to work out quite complex SQLcommands to achieve results I wanted.andM;But back to business, and we've almost completed the installation cycle.andP;  Toconnect to the database server from a workstation, it remains to run theOracle specific communications software on the client.andP;  Then fire up Paradoxor DataEase - for this review, the former as a DOS client, the latter as anOS/2 client - and we're now ready to find out how familiar these environmentswill be to established users.andM;The answer is really quite straightforward.andP;  With both products, theinterface is exactly the same as the current released versions, with theadded glamour of being able to operate on both remote and local tables.andO;Since both products are currently prerelease, it would be inappropriate  to go  into  a detailed comparison.andP;  Suffice it to say that there are bound tobe compromises.andP;  DataEase, for example, doesn't automatically return a localANSWER table as the result of a Query operation, but allows Queries to spanboth local and remote tables.andM;Other problems arise in the reverse direction.andP;  The Oracle server, forexample, limits the amount of storage space available to a database, evenwhen there's loads of of free hard disk space.andP;  As database administratoryou'd have to physically allocate more space if users tried to grow beyondthe preset limits: Storage is not dynamically allocated the way it is in thePC world.andM;f ran a series of benchmarks against the database server to compareperformance against fileserver response times.andP;  Because both the front-endswere early, non-released versions, this isn't an indication of their part inthe performance.andP;  But they do give a clear indication of the performanceadvantagesandM;of  the  client-server architecture.andM;SQL - the origins SQL was the result of IBM research during the 1970s, and in1986 became standard language for relational database management systems(RDBMS).andM;ne relational database model describes data as 'relations' or sets of records(tables), made up of individual records (rows).andP;  Attribute or rows (thingsthat are known about records) are referred to as columns' rather than fields.andM;In RDBMS language, a database is more than a single table: it can containmultiple tables as weB as information about the relationships between them.andM;SQL commands can be divided into four types: Queries, which search for data,eg SELECT, WHERE; Data Manipulation Language  (DML) statements, which add,delete or change table data, eg INSERT, UPDATE; Data Definition Language (DDL) statements, which define or delete tables, eg CREATE, ALTER, DROP; DataControl Language statements, which control access to data, eg GRANT, REVOKE.andM;SQL surveyandM;Benefits of an SQL Chent-Server RDBMS Architecture, accordingandM;to corporate user sample (194 respondents).andM;Application data sharing                   67.0 percentandM;Connectivity to disparate data stores      64.4andM;Better control of information              46.9andM;improved LAN performance                   37.1andM;Cost Savings                               25.8andM;Scalability                                19.1andM;Other                                       6.7andM;No Opinion                                  2.6andM;(Note: some respondents chose more than one option.)andM;(Source: Sapphire, May 1990.)andM;The Ashton-Tate dilemmaandM;Long before Ashton-Tate existed as a company, Wayne Ratliffe, a student,wrote a database to help him keep track of American football match results.andO;His product, which he called Vulcan, evolved into dbase II.andP;  (There never wasa dBase I: the people responsible for marketing Vulcan decided it would soundmore impressive if its name suggested a second generation product!)andM;One of the disadvantages of being a pioneer  Vulcan was conceived in the late1970s) was that dbase was locked into technology that predated the famousCodd andamp; Date rules about how relational databases (RDBMS) should operate, andadoption of SQL as an industry standard in the mid 1980s.andM;Later PC database products such as DataEase and Paradox were able to takeaccount of the Codd andamp; Date and SQL RDBMS models in their design, but forAshton-Tate the problem was much more severe.andP;  At the moment, according to UKmarketing manager Chris Mossing, Ashton-Tate has no product that would allowits installed base to interface to any SQL Server, and as of the end of thismonth Ashton-Tate relinquishes its exclusive marketing rights to theformerly-named Microsoft-Ashton-Tate SQL Server.andM;&quot;We don't view that tragically,&quot; said Mossing.andP;  &quot;To the customers that arenow asking us if we will have a product that works with servers, our answeris, we have it in the lab, but our number one priority is to get a reliabledbase [V version 1.1 to market.andP;
