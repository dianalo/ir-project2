The buying is steady, studied and institutional, traders say.    In contrast, when the OTC market's smaller stocks jumped in price last month, individual investors did most of the buying. The January price surge was typical of the OTC market, and happens each year after individuals sell shares at year end for tax purposes and reinvest early in the new year.    What is surprising, is that institutions now are plowing into small OTC issues, pushing prices gradually up.    Most popular this month have been OTC stocks with market values ranging from $20 million to $80 million. These are generally the smallest stocks that institutions can reasonably purchase. The institutions' giant block-purchases would swallow tinier companies. Institutions haven't shown much interest in stocks of this size since early 1986.    According to brokers, two types of institutions are buying these smaller OTC shares. Many are banks and financial concerns huge enough to have their own small capital-stock funds. And some managers of small funds are in the market, too.    &quot;They are looking for stocks that are under-followed, undervalued and not understood,&quot; says Reefe Austin, first vice president of institutional equities at Morgan Keegan andamp; Co., Memphis, Tenn. &quot;What they want,&quot; he says, &quot;is safety, through companies that will do well even if the economy were to fall into recession. And they are seeking out the kinds of valuations that are not truly reflected in the stock price,&quot; he adds.    Thus, these institutions have a different sort of buying list from the individual investors who tumbled into the OTC market in late December and January to speculate on the most depressed OTC issues.    Institutions are buying issues that barely slipped in price last year, and they are scrutinizing the market for sharply rising earnings potential or turnarounds not yet percieved by other investors. One current institutional target is the medium-size company that makes sophisticated medical or medical-research equipment and processes. A number of these issues recently have shown strong earnings gains.    As a result of this new buying interest, Cordis has climbed to $16 from $12.50 at the end of January; Criticare Systems closed Friday at $6.75, up from $4.75 at the end of last month; Applied Biosystems, one of the largest, has climbed to $28 from $24 in the three-week period; Finnigan Corp. has risen to $19.75 from $15.75, and Imreg Class A closed Friday at $13.625, up from $9.875 at the start of February.    Meanwhile, many of the giant OTC issues that institutions typically dominate are slipping in price this month. That's partly because these huge stocks are fodder for all institutions, including the large ones that don't have their own small-sized stock funds. And that type of institution, according to brokers, is not a major factor in the current OTC buying wave.    Perhaps as a result, such stocks as Apple Computer, the OTC's largest issue, have remained almost flat this month. Apple started the month at $41.50 a share and closed Friday at $41.75. Some scattered smaller computer issues, however, are climbing. Computer Automation has risen to $12.50 a share from $10.75 at the end of January; and VM Software is up to $12, from $8 at the end of January.    But computer issues, as a group, have not participated in the February upswing, nor did they fare particularly well in January, when individuals were doing most of the buying. Apple, for example, began the year at $42 a share, 25 cents a share higher than its Friday close.    Among large issues that have fared the best are low-profile concerns, such as the biggest electrical and lighting manufacturers. Molex, for example, has risen to $39.75 a share in February from $37 at the end of January. Cherry Corp. has edged up to $15.25 from $14.50. In this group, as with most others, it is some of the smaller issues that have shown the most impressive gains. Windmere Corp., an electrical manufacturer, closed Friday at $15.125 a share, up from $12.25 three weeks ago. </TEXT></DOC>
