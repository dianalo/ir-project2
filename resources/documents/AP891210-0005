In Massachusetts, police arrested about 75 anti-abortionprotestors who tried to block the entrances to three abortionclinics in a Boston suburb, including one a few blocks from thehome of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.   Elsewhere, abortion opponents and supporters faced off inSouthern California, pro-choice demonstrators marched on theKentucky Capitol and anti-abortion pickets moved away from anabortion clinic in Texas when several Ku Klux Klansmen came to jointheir ranks.   In Englewood, N.J., protesters blocked the entrances to theMetropolitan Medical Associates building in the New York Citysuburb at about 7:30 a.m.   Between 400 and 500 people milled outside the clinic, making itdifficult to distinguish between anti-abortion protesters andpro-choice demonstrators, said police Sgt. Arthur O'Keefe.   ``There were pushing and shoving matches breaking out all over... as well as people who had chained themselves to the frontdoor,'' O'Keefe said. ``There were some blows struck.''   Several officers received minor injuries, he said.   The sergeant said 125 anti-abortion protesters were arrested. Hesaid they face disorderly person charges for obstructing a publicpassage and contempt charges for violating the court order.   Susan Martinelli, the clinic's medical director, said staff andpatients were able to get into the clinic around 1:30 p.m. Mostpatients stayed through the protest and kept their appointments,she said.   Ms. Martinelli said the clinic had a court order enjoiningprotesters from demonstrating on the same side of the street as thebuilding. Saturday's protest was the first to violate the order,she said.   In the Boston suburb of Brookline, about 500 demonstrators onboth sides of the issue gathered at three clinics, with abortionrights supporters linking arms to try to prevent abortion opponentsfrom blocking entrances.   About 75 anti-abortion protesters were arrested on charges ofdisorderly conduct and trespassing, Patrolman Ronald Paterson said.At least one person also was arrested after punching a policeofficer, he said.   Those arrested were expected to be arraigned Monday in BrooklineDistrict Court, Paterson said.   In Texas, about 20 Klansmen in a protest outside a clinic in theFort Worth suburb of White Settlement. Bill Walton, grand dragon ofthe state's KKK, criticized two dozen other anti-abortion picketswho moved across the street when the Klansmen arrived.   ``They're like cowards; they ran like rats off a sinking ship,''Walton said.   Rick Horton, leader of the protesters from the Tarrant CountyPro-Life Action Network, said his group did not want to beassociated with the Klan. Horton said Walton contacted him earlierand said he was against the ``the murder of white babies.''   ``Sure, we're pro-white, but I also told him we're against themurder of all babies,'' Walton said. ``If some Negro wanted to comeout there and protest with us, he could have.''   About 550 people tracked through snow and ice to a rally forwomen's rights at the Kentucky Capitol in Frankfort. State Reps.Ernesto Scorsone and Susan Stokes urged participants to write theirstate legislators to lobby against any attempt to restrict abortionin the state.   In Fullerton, Calif., about 200 people from the anti-abortiongroup Operation Rescue and an equal number of pro-choice activistsdemonstrated outside an abortion clinic for four hours, Sgt. SteveMatson said. The clinic was closed Saturday and there were noarrests, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
