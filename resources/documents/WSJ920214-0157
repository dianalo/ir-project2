The Persian Gulf emirate, the largest shareholder in thecollapsed Luxembourg-registered bank, issued a statement inLondon saying it is concerned that Price Waterhouse is tryingto deflect public criticism for its handling of BCCI'saudits.</LP><TEXT>   Abu Dhabi was particularly critical of testimony by PriceWaterhouse to a House of Commons committee reviewing the BCCIaffair and possible U.K. regulatory changes in its wake.   &quot;The majority shareholders consider that certain of thestatements about them are grossly misleading and reject theallegations made,&quot; the statement said. The statement didn'tspecifically pinpoint what the government found offensive.   Abu Dhabi maintained that the auditor's testimony &quot;ignoresthe efforts&quot; it initiated to investigate BCCI. And it saidthat Price Waterhouse's allegations &quot;appear to rely heavilyon information derived from members of the previousmanagement of BCCI, whose position is such as to make anyreliance on their statements both unjustified and hazardous.&quot;   Price Waterhouse maintained in its testimony largely thatit was the victim of a &quot;scheme of deception&quot; that was&quot;sophisticated and complex.&quot;   In response to the Abu Dhabi criticism, Price Waterhousesaid it &quot;stands by the evidence we gave&quot; to the Commonscommittee last week. And it rejected Abu Dhabi's suggestionthat its testimony was an attempt to deflect criticism forits handling of BCCI. The firm maintained that it testifiedbecause of a formal query by the committee that it couldn'tlegally ignore. A spokeswoman for the firm said she wasn'table to comment on what testimony Abu Dhabi believes ismisleading.   BCCI was seized by the Bank of England and otherregulators in July 1991 after a special audit by PriceWaterhouse uncovered evidence of extensive frauds that hadleft the bank insolvent. The audit was requested by the Bankof England.</TEXT></DOC>
