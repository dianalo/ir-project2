The Enquirer said that after gaining access to all of MissTaylor's medical records, it is satisfied that the articlesreporting on the actress's medical condition and the reportthat she was drinking were in error. The paper said itpublished the articles in good faith reliance on informationprovided to it, but the information was inaccurate. IainCalder, Enquirer editor, said in a statement, &quot;we regret theinaccuracies in the articles but are pleased that thisdispute has come to an amicable end.&quot;   Miss Taylor said she feels &quot;completely vindicated,&quot; andthat after the newspaper's management determined the articleswere in error, the Enquirer &quot;acted promptly and in goodfaith.&quot;   Miss Taylor initially sought damages of $20 million in LosAngeles Superior Court, according to Neil Papiano, herattorney. Although Mr. Papiano wouldn't specify the size ofthe settlement, he said &quot;we were persuaded that it wascertainly large enough that we shouldn't go to trial.&quot;   As previously reported, G.P.
