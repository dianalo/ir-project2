Brokers said the rejection will make it more difficult for them to recover losses that could be as high as $750 million.    The British court said it has no jurisdiction over the inter-governmental agency. Eleven creditor brokers and Kleinwort Benson Ltd., a British merchant bank, had asked for the council to be declared bankrupt and its 22 member governments to be held liable for debts it incurred in a world tin-market collapse more than a year ago.    The council ran out of money to support tin prices Oct. 24, 1985, leaving debts to metals brokers and banks estimated at $1.35 billion.    Its members include such tin producers Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, Canada and several other tin-consuming nations in Europe. The U.S. left the organization in 1982.    A spokesman for the creditors said the group will consider appealing the court's decision to the House of Lords, Britain's highest court. </TEXT></DOC>
