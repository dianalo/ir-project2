The strong absorptivity at 365 nm of the cobalt(III)/azide-complexformed makes possible the establishment of a simple and fast spectrophotometricmethod for sulfite determinations in aqueous solution. With manganese(II)as an activator and 5 cm cuvettes for absorption measurements the workingrange is between 5 . 10/sup -7/ and 5 . 10/sup -5/ mol/l sulfite. Thenew method has been successfully applied to the investigation of rainwatersamples. Of the potential interferences only those originating from iron(III)and formaldehyde are of practical relevance. The first one can be avoidedby proper blank correction, the second by a slight modification of theprocedure.</TEXT></DOC>
