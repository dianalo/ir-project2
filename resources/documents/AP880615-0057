Effective Thursday, the government will screen all Vietnameseboat people entering the British colony's waters to determine ifthey are political refugees or economic migrants, said theofficial, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Boat people who left their homeland for economic reasons will behoused in a prison-like camp on an outlying island of Hong Kongpending an agreement with Vietnam on repatriation, the officialsaid.   Chief Secretary Sir David Ford planned to announce the change ofpolicy today before the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's lawmakingbody.   Hong Kong long has assumed all arriving boat people are refugeeseligible for temporary asylum. They are housed in refugee campspending resettlement in a third country such as the United Statesor Canada.   But local officials say many left Vietnam for economic reasons,not to escape political persecution, and finding resettlement homesfor them has become increasingly difficult.   About 7,800 boat people have braved the treacherous trip fromVietnam to Hong Kong this year through Tuesday, or 12 times thenumber who arrived during the corresponding period last year,government statistics show. The number of boat people has soared toabout 16,200.   Only 1,200 boat people left Hong Kong camps for resettlementthis year through Tuesday, up slightly from the correspondingperiod last year.   The boat people already in the colony will not be affected bythe new policy, the government official said.   Other non-communist Southeast Asian governments recently havechanged their policy toward accepting Vietnamese boat people.   Thailand earlier this year pushed back to sea Vietnamese boatsattempting to land and several deaths were reported. Bangkok backedoff after sharp international criticism and reopened its doors, butinsisted the new arrivals would not be eligible for resettlement.   Malaysia announced in April it would begin turning away boatpeople at some unspecified future date.</TEXT></DOC>
