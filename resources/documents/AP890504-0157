North, the Marine at the shadowycenter of the Reagan administration's secret effort to arm theNicaragua Contras, was convicted Thursday of shredding documentsand two other charges in the Iran-Contra affair. He was acquittedon nine other counts.   North, who faces up to 10 years in prison on the convictions,accepted the verdict without any show of emotion. But a congressalsupporter described him as ``absolutely elated'' at the jury'sdecision.   After judge and jury had left the room, North walked to arailing separating him from his wife, Betsy, and kissed her lightlyon the cheek. Mrs. North had been sitting in the front row with aclergyman.   North left the courthouse with his wife and his lawyer. Theymade no comments to the crowd of reporters and onlookers.   It was the first trial born of the scandal that marred the lasttwo years of Ronald Reagan's presidency and raised questions aboutthen Vice President George Bush's involvment in theadministration's clandestine effort to arm the Contras. Even as thejury was returning its verdict, Bush told reporters at the WhiteHouse that he did not participate in any arrangement to expedit aidto other countries in exchange for their support for the Contras.The White House said Bush would have no comment on the verdict.   In Los Angeles, former President Reagan also declined comment.   North's defense was that he had been a good soldier loyallycarrying out what he knew his commander-in-chief, the president,wanted.   ``The principle that no man is above the law has beenvindicated,'' said prosecutor John Keker, who refused to answerreporters' questions.   Keker, in a brief statement on the courthouse steps, toldreporters, ``Some said the system of justice could not dealeffectively with this case. Some even said it could not be tried.Col. North has been convicted of three very serious charges. Thejury has spoken.''   North, 45, was pale and smiling nervously as he entered thecourtroom where his trial began with jury selection more than threemonths ago.   The former Marine lieutenant colonel, twice wounded in theVietnam war and decorated with the Silver Star for heroism,remained seated while the judge read the verdict.   His three daughters and one son were not in the courtreoom,which was crowded with reporters, sketch artists, lawyers and a fewmembers of the public. The nine women and three men on the jury didnot look at North as they filed into their seats.   The panel found North guilty of three criminal charges _shredding documents, accepting an illegal gratuity and one count ofaiding and abetting in an obstruction of Congress.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell set June 23 forsentencing. The illegal gratuity conviction _ accepting a $13,800security fence for his home _ carries a maximum penalty of twoyears in prison and a $250,000 fine.   The conviction for destroying documents is punishable by a threeyear sentence and $250,000 fine. For obstruction of Congress, themaximum penalty is five years and $250,000. It was unlikely thatthe prison terms, if any, would be consecutive.   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who had been one of North's chiefdefenders in the congressional Iran-Contra hearings two years ago,was in the courtroom for the verdict. Afterward, he walked up toNorth at the defense table and shook his hand. North smiled broadly.   Rep. Dana Rohrabacker, R- Calif., described North as``absolutely elated.''   ``We gave each other thumbs up,'' said Rohrabacker, a formerWhite House aide for whom North campaigned last year. He said thejury found North guilty ``of only cutting corners and not breakingthe law.''   North had arrived in the courtroom with his lawyers at 2:20p.m., about 50 minutes after the judge received a note from thejury that a verdict had been reached. They had been at their taskfor 64 hours, spread over 12 days.   North, a Marine lieutenant colonel detailed to the NationalSecurity Council, was the key figure in the two-year effort to helpthe rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist government after Congressbanned official U.S. aid.   He was involved, too, in arrangements under which the UnitedStates secretly sold arms to Iran and he also helped divert someprofits from those sales to help the Contras.   Public disclosure of the affair in November 1986 began the worstcrisis of President Reagan's eight-year presidency, a public furorthat didn't subside until after televised congressional hearingsthat made North a national figure.   His lawyers had asked Reagan to testify in his behalf but theformer president refused and the judge upheld his position.President Bush, too, was subpoenaed and that summons also wasquashed.   Their names surfaced, however, as the trial spotlighted onceagain the bitterness dividing the Reagan administration _ whichwanted to help the guerrillas fighting the leftist Nicaraguangovernment _ and the Congress which banned such aid betweenmid-1984 and mid-1986.   Documents released during the trial showed Bush may have beenaware of plans to increase U.S. aid to Honduras in exchange forthat country's giving sanctuary to the Contras. They suggested,too, that he and Reagan were far more deeply involved in the Contracause than has been acknowledged before.   A government ``admission'' described how Reagan, Bush and othertop government officials took part in elaborate efforts to inducethird countries to give military support to the guerrillas inreturn for favors and aid from the United States. These were theso-called ``quid pro quo'' arrangements.   The charges dealt not with North's clandestine activities onbehalf of the Contras _ at a time when Congress ordered all U.S.aid withheld _ but with the former National Security Council aide'sattempts to cover up his efforts.   The jury convicted North of falsifying and destroying documentsin November 1986 as the affair was about to become public, and ofaccepting an illegal gratuity _ a $13,800 home security system _from Iran-Contra co-defendant Richard Secord.   North also was convicted of aiding and abetting in obstructionof Congress by falsifying a chronology of events in the affair. Thefalse chronology stated that no one in the U.S. government knewuntil January 1986 that a CIA-assisted shipment from Israel to Iranin November 1985 contained Hawk missiles.   He was acquitted of five other charges of lying to orobstructing Congress, of two counts of lying to then-AttorneyGeneral Edwin Meese III and obstructing Meese's inquiry into theaffair, of converting traveler's checks to his own use and ofconspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service by using atax-exempt foundation to raise funds for the Contras.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
