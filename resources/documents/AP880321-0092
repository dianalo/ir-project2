RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to decidewhether public officials may be sued when their alleged grossnegligence permits a child to be abused by a parent.   The justices said they will hear an appeal on behalf of aWisconsin boy who at age 4 was seriously and permanently braindamaged from beatings by his father.   Social workers were accused of violating the child'sconstitutional rights by failing to come to his rescue after theyhad repeated evidence he was being beaten.   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year threw out thesuit against the Winnebago County, Wis., Department of SocialServices and two of its employees.   The boy, Joshua DeShaney, first came to the attention of thewelfare agency when he was brought to a hospital in 1983 with cutsand bruises. The girlfriend of Joshua's father said the boy wasinjured in an attack by another child.   Officials suspected he was being abused by adults. A socialworker, Ann Kemmeter, was assigned to the case.   Joshua was returned to the custody of his father, RandyDeShaney, with a recommendation that DeShaney's girlfriend move outof the house because DeShaney had hinted she might be abusing theboy.   DeShaney's former wife and Joshua's mother, Melody DeShaney, wasliving in Cheyenne, Wyo., where the couple had been divorced.   A month after the first hospital visit, Joshua again was treatedfor suspicious injuries.   Ms. Kemmeter visited the DeShaney home on several occaisons andnoticed bumps on Joshua's head. The boy also was treated again at ahosptal for various bruises and injuries. Also, DeShaney'sgirlfriend still was living at the home.   Ms. Kemmeter visited the DeShaney home on March 7, 1984, and wastold that several days earlier Joshua had fainted in the bathroomfor no apparent reason. But according to court records she did notask to see the boy.   The following day Joshua was treated at a hospital for headinjuries that destroyed half his brain, leaving him profoundlyretarded and institutionalized for the rest of his life.   The boy's father was convicted of child abuse and sentenced totwo to four years in prison.   The county social services department and its employees weresued by Joshua's mother on grounds the boy was deprived of libertywithout due process.   The 7th Circuit court said in dismissing the suit, ``If thedefendants, though blameworthy, did not cause Joshua's injuries,they cannot be said to have deprived him of his liberty.Deprivation implies causation.''   The appeals court continued, ``It is unlikely that AnnKemmeter's well-intentioned but ineffectual intervention did Joshuaany good at all. But it is most unlikely that it did him any harm.She merely failed to protect him from his bestial father.''   The appeals court added that Ms. Kemmeter ``failed to act onmounting and eventually overwhelming evidence that Joshua was ingreat peril from his father.''   But the appeals court said it would place welfare agencies in anunfair predicament to require them to take custody of children whoare suspected victims of abuse.   ``To place every state welfare department on the razor's edge,where if it terminates parental rights it is exposed to ... suit bythe parent ... and if it fails to terminate those rights it isexposed to ... suit by the child, is unlikely to improve thewelfare of American families and is not grounded in constitutionaltext or principle,'' the appeals court said.   In her appeal to the Supreme Court, Mrs. DeShaney said the 7thCircuit court ruling is in conflict with decisions by other appealscourts.   In other action, the court:   _ Left unresolved whether public school students enjoy anyconstitutional protection against paddling or other corporalpunishment by teachers and administrators.   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals courtruling in a New Mexico case that ``at some degree of excessivenessor cruelty'' such punishment violates constitutional rights. Butanother appeals court has rejected that view.   _ Refused to let the Dalkon Shield's maker set up a $15 millionemergency fund to help women who say the contraceptive device leftthem infertile.   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that blockscreation of the fund pending the outcome of bankruptcy proceedingsfor A.H. Robins, which manufactures the device.   In a related case, the court refused to review a ruling that atleast temporarily barred some Dalkon Shield users from suing AetnaCasualty andamp; Surety Co., which insures A.H. Robins for liabilityclaims.   _ Rejected a constitutional attack on a federal law requiringbroadcasters to give equal time to opposing candidates for publicoffice.   The justices, without comment, turned down the appeal of aSacramento, Calif., television reporter kept off the air while heran for a non-salaried town council seat.   _ Agreed to consider killing a key provision of a law designedto promote competitive bidding on government contracts, setting thestage for a new ruling on the boundaries between congressional andpresidential powers.   The court said it will hear Reagan administration argumentschallenging the comptroller general's role in administering the1984 Competition in Contracting Act.   _ Agreed to decide whether states may impose sales taxes on mostbooks, newspapers and magazines while exempting religiouspublications.   The justices said they will review a Texas court ruling thatsaid such a tax neither violates equal-protection rights norbreeches the constitutionally required separation of church andstate.   _ Refused to let states and local governments regulate theprices most of the nation's cable television operators charge forbasic service.   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that thederegulation effected in 1986 by Congress and the FederalCommunications Commission left subscribers vulnerable to illegalmonopoly pricing.   _ Agreed to examine the power of labor unions to fire electedofficials for disagreeing with union policies.   The court said it will consider killing a lawsuit by a LosAngeles area union business representative who said he was firedillegally by the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association.   _ Agreed to consider shielding states from having to help payfor cleaning up hazardous waste sites when the federal governmentsues businesses under the so-called Superfund law.   The court said it will hear arguments by Pennsylvania officialsthat exposing states to such liability could saddle them with $100billion in clean-up costs.   The child-abuse case is DeShaney vs. Winnebago County, 87-154.</TEXT></DOC>
