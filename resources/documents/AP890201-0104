Following deadly riots during the 1987 pilgrimage, which theSaudis blamed on Iran, the Saudi government declared only one personout of every 1,000 people in Moslem countries would be allowed tovisit the shrines. Previously, there were no restrictions.   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's parliament speaker, disclosed Tuesdaythat ``indirect contacts'' were being made ``to overcome theproblems'' that led the Saudis to sever diplomatic ties with Tehranlast April.   One of the key problems was the pilgrimage, called the hajj.   Rafsanjani was quoted by Iran's official Islamic Republic NewsAgency, monitored in Cyprus, as saying: ``Hajj must cease to be ahollow worship and should instead be turned into an active andexhilarating assembly for the Islamic world to raise its issues andproblems.''   The Saudi announcement, distributed by the official Saudi PressAgency, said that in response to queries from Islamic states thekingdom ``would like to reaffirm the necessity of adherence to thequotas.''   They will continue to apply ``this year and in the coming fewyears'' until expansion and development schemes at the holy sitesare completed, it said.   Iran's 1988 quota was set at 45,000, or one-third the contingentit sent in the two previous years. That angered Iranian leaders, whoordered a boycott of that hajj.   In 1987, Iranian pilgrims defied a Saudi ban on politicalactivities and demonstrated in Mecca. Some 402 people, mainlyIranians, were killed in ensuing clashes with Saudi security forces.   Saudi Arabia said the pilgrims died in a stampede. But Irancharged Saudi police opened fire on them.   In 1986, Saudi security authorities unveiled what they said was aplan by Iranian pilgrims to smuggle explosives and instigate riotsduring the hajj.   According to the lunar calender, hajj falls in July this year.Every devout Moslem whether Sunni or Shiite, is obliged to make thehajj if they can afford it.</TEXT></DOC>
