In a victory for environmental groups, Judge Louis Oberdorfer banned after April 15 the sale of some additional, existing stocks of chlordane and heptachlor, pesticides that at one time accounted for 60% of U.S. sales of termite-control chemicals.    The order makes it illegal after April 15 to sell, or for exterminators to use, remaining products made with the chemicals by about 25 licensed pesticide formulators.    The Environmental Protection Agency says the order affects only a small amount of pesticides. Most pesticides using the chemicals were removed from use by a 1987 agreement between the EPA and the chemicals' only manufacturer, Velsicol Chemical Corp. of Rosemont, Ill. Officials at Velsicol couldn't be reached for comment on the judge's action.    The judge ruled the EPA couldn't let exterminators, stores and distributors continue selling and using remaining stocks of chlordane and heptachlor because the agency failed to show that their use wouldn't harm the environment. </TEXT></DOC>
