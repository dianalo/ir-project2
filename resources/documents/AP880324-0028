The outlook for a pact to sharply reduce long-range nuclearweapons is not all that bright either. The U.S. Strategic DefenseInitiative has not been swept away as an obstacle, and differencesremain over how the bombers, submarines and missiles would bescrapped.   ``I wouldn't want to lay you odds,'' was Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz's hesitant response Wednesday night to whether thetreaty would be ready for Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail S.Gorbachev to sign during the May 29-June 2 summit.   Mobile missiles and sea-launched cruise missiles are hard tospot. That makes verifying compliance with the 30 percent to 50percent arms reductions more difficult than last year's treaty toban medium-range nuclear weapons.   Experts on the two sides are still trying to mesh conflictingdrafts. U.S. and Soviet negotiators in Geneva were directed byShultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to keepworking at the verification problem and to report to them at theirnext meeting in Moscow April 21.   A treaty signing is not a prerequisite for a successful summit.Reagan and Gorbachev have plenty of issues to discuss at theirfourth meeting.   But the report Shultz gave at a news conference of his talkswith Shevardnadze was generally bleak. It suggested the two leadersmight not have much to celebrate.   Shultz seemed taken with a promise by the foreign minister toconsider changes in the way the Soviets deal with religiousobservances and with visa applications. Emigration of ethnicGermans and Armenians is up, Shultz noted.   But he said Jewish emigration had reached a plateau. Besides,Shultz said of the promised reforms, ``what we are interested in isdelivery.''   When he turned to regional disputes, the clouds turned darker.   Gorbachev is committed to end the Red Army's occupation ofAfghanistan after more than eight years of bloody strife withU.S.-backed rebels.   But Shultz said the United States would not concur in anagreement to end the war unless the Soviets also suspended militaryaid to the Marxist government in Kabul.   The main purpose of the U.S. demand is to make it easier for anestimated 5 million refugees to return home. Had Moscow accepted,the United States would have stopped supplying Stinger missiles andother weapons to the resistance.   The moratorium would be in effect during the Soviet troopwithdrawal and for three months afterward.   ``They didn't feel they could agree to that,'' Shultz said.   And yet, he said, ``those conditions are needed for us to beable to sign as a guarantor'' of an international agreement to endthe conflict.   At the Soviet embassy, meanwhile, Shevardnadze was taking astiff stand.   The aid is required by a Soviet treaty with the Kabulgovernment. ``Those are legitimate supplies, and we are not goingto rescind that treaty,'' he said.   The picture in Central America and the Middle East wasn'tbrighter.   Shultz said the Soviets wanted U.S. military aid to anunspecified number of Central American governments halted as acondition for them to stop supplying Nicaragua for its war withContra rebels.   ``It did not seem something we could pursue,'' Shultz said.   On the Middle East, he said Shevardnadze envisioned an activerole for Moscow in Arab-Israeli negotiations.   Shultz said that would get in the way of talks between the twosides. ``The Soviet concept is sharply different from ours,''Shultz said.   And in the Persian Gulf, Shultz offered only hope that JavierPerez de Cuellar, the U.N. Secretary-General, would be able topersuade Iran and Iraq to end their 7{-year war.   Referring to pictures of Iranian victims of alleged Iraqichemical weapons, Shultz said: ``The horrors of this war are justbeing borne in on us practically every day. It's hard to think itmight get worse, but it does get worse.''   For eight months, the United States has sought to persuade theSoviets to support an international arms embargo against Iran,which refuses to accept a cease-fire. But Shevardnadze evidentlydid not give in.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Schweid is head of the AP's StateDepartment staff.</TEXT></DOC>
