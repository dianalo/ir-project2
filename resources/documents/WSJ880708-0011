Investors, Richmond, Va., and United, Vienna, Va., said they are continuing to hold discussions and believe a combination of the two banks is &quot;desirable.&quot; Under negotiation are the amount of cash and securities to be paid to United shareholders. Results are expected to be announced within a week.    The previously announced agreement calls for United shareholders to receive $11.20 in cash and $16.80 of 8% convertible preferred stock of Investors. United has 1.1 million common shares outstanding, giving the total acquisition a value of about $40.7 million. </TEXT></DOC>
