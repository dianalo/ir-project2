(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>PageMaker 4.0: Aldus Fights to Stay on TopandM;SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION in 1985, Aldus PageMaker has remained the leadingdesktop publishing program on the market.andP;  But when you're number one, thereare always plenty of competitors looking to knock you off your throne.andP;  InAldus's case, the competitors come from both the PC and the Macintoshmarkets.andM;On the PC side, PageMaker shares top billing with Ventura Publisher, whichhas set the standard in the microcomputer composition market for producinglong documents.andM;On the Mac side, Quark has made a concerted effort to establish itself as thepreferred choice for professional pagination by adding more flexibletypography and by providing facilities for third parties to write extensionsthat support functionality that Quark hasn't gotten around to developingitself.andP;  Quark is now ready to introduce a version that focuses on ease ofuse plus better layout and typographic features.andM;Meanwhile, Letraset has set its sights on conquering the design market andeven hopes to appeal to top-quality typography operations with its newDesignStudio on the Mac.andM;Aldus's response to these challenges is PageMaker 4.0, announced a couple ofweeks ago and to be demonstrated at the Seybold Sminars on March 5.andP;  This newrelease adds a bevy of features that Aldus hopes will keep the competition atbay.andP;  Aldus cites more than 70 new features that address current needs inword processing, production of long documents, typographic qualtiy and color.andO;Here are a few of the key new items:andM;* Links--the ability to detect changes to a source text or graphics file andautomatically update the text or graphic file in the PageMaker document.andM;* Story editor--a word processor that displays monosized text in a pop-upwindow and provides a faster alternative to editing in the slower WYSIWYGmode.andM;* Typography--more flexibility (rotation, finer increments for type sizes andspacing) and size-dependent tracking.andM;* Tables--a separate table editor that is a marked improvement over themanual methods PageMaker offered previously.andM;* Long-document handling--combining multiple documents into a single book,and compiling a table of contents and an index for the entire book.andP;  There ismuch more control over pagination including the ability to set paragraph,column and page breaks.andP;  Graphics and rules can be embedded in text.andM;* Color--previously sold as a separate Color Extension module, version 4.0includes the ability to apply Pantone colors and output full-page colorseparations using Aldus PrePrint, a $495 option.andM;Using a beta release of 4.0, we tested the new features, using the productionof this article as part of our test.andP;  For those new to PageMaker, an overviewof the program and a description of how we used it to produce this documentis on page 28.andM;Version 4.0 in perspective.andP;  PageMaker 4.0 feels, acts and looks like 3.0, soPageMaker fans won't need to relearn anything.andP;  The newer concepts, such aslinking and indexing, will require some work to master, but, as is typicalfor PageMaker, the new menus and options are intuitive and easy to learn.andO;The rest of the system will seem very familiar.andP;  Although it includes newfeatures to make page composition more automatic, it retains the originalpasteboard premise, giving users the option to cut and paste manually or toset up style sheets, links and in-line graphics.andM;To these traditional strengths, version 3.0 added the ability to flow largeamounts of text automatically, creating new pages as needed.andP;  In version 4.0,PageMaker has many new long-document features and now performs remarkablywell as one tool for a variety of tasks.andP;  In this article, our discussionwill concentrate on the major new features.andP;  But there are many minorimprovements to existing features that will save PageMaker users a great dealof time and effort.andP;  We'll touch on some of these as we proceed.andM;Handling long documentsandM;PageMaker has always excelled in the production of ad-hoc documents:advertisements, brochures, annual reports and other applications where eachpublication requires an original design.andP;  But the very features that makeoriginal designs easy can work against the producer of long documents, sinceeach page must be individually laid out, each photo positioned, widows andorphans checked on each page, multicolumn tables fitted individually, etc.andM;PageMaker's major weakness in competing with Ventura Publisher has been inthe preparation of long documents: technical manuals, books, dissertationsand so forth.andP;  Such documents have strict formatting requirements, andusually involve footnotes and end-notes, floating illustrations, indices,tables of contents, lists of illustrations and so on.andP;  In addition, it isoften necessary to update portions of a publication, often over a period ofmany years.andP;  Because Ventura copes well with these demands it has captured amajor share of the PC market.andM;Closing the gap.andP;  With version 4.0, PageMaker has come a lot closer tomeeting the demands of long-document publishers.andP;  One of the new features isthe ability to handle documents up to 999 pages in length, but more importantin most situations is the new &quot;book&quot; facility.andP;  Large publications can bedivided into smaller sections and still be considered part of the samedocument or &quot;book&quot; by PageMaker.andP;  Separate files can be grouped together inone book to compile a common index and contents, as well as batch print theentire book in one step.andM;Page numbering must still be done separately and manually for each section.andO;In each section, the user must specify the starting page number; if youforget to update later chapters when earlier chapters grow longer or shorter,the later chapter swill all be numbered wrong!andP;  So will the indexes andtables of contents that are generated subsequently.andP;  To find the rightstarting page numbers, the user will have to examine each file in turn,carrying the ending number of the prior chapter forward on scratch paper.andO;The situation would be somewhat eased if PageMaker would let you have twodocuments open at the same time, but it doesn't.andM;You do, however, now have the option of Arabic, Roman or alphabeticnumbering.andM;Improved style sheets.andP;  One of the most-requested improvements to theoriginal PageMaker design was to add style sheets to the program.andP;  ButPageMaker 3.0 users were still not satisfied.andP;  Version 3.0 could read onlythe character properties (font, size, bold or italic attributes) and wouldstrip any paragraph properties such as &quot;keep with same paragraph' andwidow/orphan settings.andP;  Power word-processor users will be happy to find thatversion 4.0 retains these formats and styles from a long list of wordprocessors.andM;Using styles in PageMaker is easier than in many word processors.andP;  Anyone whohas shied away from style sheets in Microsoft Word, for example, will findPageMaker's similar, but less confusing to edit and apply.andM;The styles are based on an inheritance tree; if you change a parent style,the children pick up the change automatically.andP;  The styles now include a&quot;next style&quot; option.andP;  If, for example, the &quot;body copy&quot; style always followsthe &quot;subhead&quot; style, you don't have to select the body copy style every timeyou type a subhead.andP;  In the subhead style sheet, simply select body copy inthe &quot;next style&quot; box.andP;  When you type a carriage return after the subhead, youwill automatically be typing in body copy mode.andM;PageMaker will convert styles with the same name to the style you assigned inthe PageMaker document so that you can set up your favorite fonts and sizesin your word processor to print drafts.andM;Widow/orphan controls.andP;  Under the paragraph box you can set the maximumnumber of lines allowed at the bottom (widow) or top (orphan) of a column.andO;For headings and tables you can also use the &quot;keep with next x lines&quot; toprevent their breaking up.andM;Long-document publishers will be happy to know that the previouslydisregarded &quot;soft&quot; carriage return or &quot;line end,&quot; which is of immenseimportance when paginating lists or directories, has been brought intoversion 4.0.andP;  For example, you may not want an entry (i.e., name, address andphone) to start at the bottom of a page and continue on the next page, oreven the next column.andP;  Using the soft return (shift+enter) in combinationwith the &quot;keep lines together&quot; prevents bad breaks.andP;  You can also forcecolumn and page breaks from within any given paragraph without having toreflow text.andM;Table of contents.andP;  Generating a TOC or index should be one of the last stepsin your production process because any changes you make to the publicationwill not be reflected in the TOC or index unless you recompile it.andP;  Providedyou have used the paragraph settings properly, generating a table of contentsis totally automatic.andP;  Simply select the menu option &quot;compile TOC&quot; and let itrip.andP;  A loaded text icon will appear and the text can be placed like anyother story.andP;  You can edit it to make changes; however, these edits will benot be carried over if you recompile it.andM;When defining a paragraph within a style, a user should decide which stylesare to be included in the table of contents (e.g., all headline styles).andO;Then, under the paragraph option of each headline style, check the &quot;includein table of contents&quot; box.andP;  Individual paragraphs can also be included in thetable of contents manually in the same fashion, irrespective of their styletag.andP;  Untagged paragraphs will be omitted from the TOC on the assumption thatthey are routine body copy.andM;Indexing.andP;  Considering the overwhelming task that creating an index can be,Aldus has done a terrific job in designing PageMaker's index generator.andP;  Itis simple to use and understand, yet it employs a built-in database,automatic formatting and cross-referencing.andM;PageMaker makes index entries as simple as selecting a word and pressingcommand + semicolon.andP;  An index box pops up and the word and information youenter in it is stored in the invisible database.andP;  You can change the word,add a different word by which you want the index to sort and assign it alevel from one to three.andP;  So that you do not duplicate a topic, you can viewtopics already created and select one of those or add another.andP;  When youreturn to the story editor a symbol appears before the word.andM;PageMaker's import filters should also accept any index formatting from anyword processor with indexing capability.andM;The hardest part of creating an index is the editing stage.andP;  With manyindexing programs you can only edit the index after you've compiled it andplaced in on a page.andP;  In PageMaker you can edit the actual database under the&quot;show index&quot; command and it will change the information stored in the actualindex database, rather than just making edits to an already compiled index.andO;This is an indispensable but rare feature.andP;  Bravo!andM;To help speed your index tagging you might use the &quot;find&quot; option in the storyeditor to find certain styles, words or phrases.andP;  Once you've tagged all yourentries and checked them under &quot;show index,&quot; you can pick one of two basicindexing styles (runin or nested) and for each it lets you choose whichcharacters will be automatically inserted around entries.andM;Just like the TOC, indexing is automatic at this point.andP;  PageMaker evenprovides default styles for the index, including large type section letters,or you can set up styles for different levels of entries.andM;Inline graphics.andP;  Graphics can be embedded into text so that when the text isreflowed the graphic will flow in the same spot in the story as if it weretext.andP;  The graphic can also be assigned text attributes such as leading,space before and after paragraph, and centered in the column.andP;  As an inlinegraphic it can still be resized and moved up or down within its leadingspecification.andP;  The table on page 32 was embedded, sized and positioned thatway.andP;  It's also great for graphic endmarks.andP;  But alas, for long documents wewould like the option to float graphics to a preferred location on the pageor spread.andM;An option in the paragraph specifications box lets you assign the standardPageMaker rules (hairline to 12-point) above and below a paragraph and setthem to the width of the text or column.andP;  We were also able to import thelines above and below paragraphs from a Microsoft Word document.andM;Text and graphics file linkingandM;A totally new concept for PageMaker, the links management feature providesusers with a list of all files &quot;placed&quot; in a PageMaker publication.andO;Moreover, when it copies these files into the PageMaker document it maintainsa link with these original files so that PageMaker can report changes inthem.andP;  In the original files are modified, PageMaker gives users the optionto replace each one automatically, without having to place each element onthe pages.andM;How it works.andP;  A text or graphics file is &quot;copied&quot; (using the &quot;place&quot;command) into a PageMaker document.andP;  This establishes a link with theoriginal file in its original location.andP;  This one-way linking permits editingin the original word processor or graphics program while a preliminaryversion is being laid out on pages.andP;  Linked files are stored intact in theiroriginal form.andM;As with 3.0 you still have the option to export the file from PageMaker,overwriting the original or creating a new version.andP;  In contrast, VenturaPublisher will automatically overwrite the original linked file when the fileis saved.andP;  This is either an advantage or a drawback, depending on your workflow and shop discipline.andM;Linking stories to a main document is intended for &quot;work-group&quot; environments,but it is not quite as sophisticated as high-end, networked, publishingprograms.andP;  Yes, you can edit in your word processor or graphics program evenafter the story/graphic has been laid out on the page, but everyone mustfollow strict guidelines or edits could be inadvertently lost.andP;  For now,Aldus gives users &quot;responsibility&quot; for file management because PageMakercannot use safety features such as file locking.andP;  Fortunately, PageMakerwon't overwrite edits automatically without a warning (unless you turn thealert off).andM;Herein lies a hazard.andP;  Suppose the layout person is making corrections andcopying fitting adjustments to the publication while a writer is busilymaking a few last-minute refinements to the same story in the word processor.andO;When the layout person prints, opens or &quot;updates&quot; the publication, PageMakerkindly warns that changes have been made and gives you the option to update.andO;If the decision is to update, the alarm is: &quot;The copy of the document storedin the publication has been modified.andP;  Updating it will cause themodifications to be lost.andP;  Update anyway?&quot;andP;  At this point the changes to bothversions have to be manually consolidated, either on the page or in theoriginal application.andM;Users of link management need to establish a set workflow and cut-off point.andO;Once the layout person starts making changes on the page, the original fileshould not be edited.andP;  If it is, the operator will have to choose whichupdated version to use and which one to lose.andP;  Before the cut-off point thelayout person should not make any changes or they may have to be sacrificedin favor of the editor's changes.andP;  Once the editor surrenders the story tothe layout department, all changes must be made on the page in order to avoidthe possibility that changes will be made to both the copy on the page andthe original file.andM;The advantage is that you can preserve a master copy of the text file (theword processor file) for future revision cycles, but still do minorfine-tuning of the copy on the page.andP;  This is useful where it is necessary torewrite a bit of text to make it fit the page better, or where the documentmust be produced in several &quot;localized&quot; versions.andM;PageMaker users can think of the update as an automatic re-&quot;place&quot; optionthat re-imports all the elements while maintaining the layout.andM;Godsend.andP;  Links are especially helpful for graphics.andP;  A preliminary orlow-resolution version or simply a placeholder can be imported into thePageMaker publication while the larger high-resolution file is stored orworked on separately but linked to the publication.andP;  While large (over 64K)graphics were linked in 3.0, users had no way of managing the link and somemay not have known it existed until they removed the graphic and PageMakercouldn't find it.andP;  Linking is of critical importance when using the OpenPrepress Interface, PageMaker's format for sending files to a high-resolutioncolor system.andM;Story editorandM;Most vendors (Interleaf is a notable exception) simply say that a page layoutprogram is no substitute for a word processor if you have major rewriting inmind; text editing on the page should be limited to fixing spelling mistakesyou notice at the last minute.andM;Aldus has made a substantial contribution to PageMaker's productivity byadding a separate text editing function.andP;  It reminds us of the editingwindows on high-end WYSIWYG composition systems like Compugraphic's PowerViewand Integrator: no visible columns, fonts or size changes, but quick and easyability to change the words.andP;  In the margin PageMaker does dispaly the stylefor every paragraph and has an option to display spaces, paragraph markersand tabs.andP;  You can even set your own font and size preferences for viewingtext in the story editor.andP;  (A new acronym from Aldus: WYSIWYCR--what you seeis what you can read.)andM;Clicking the mouse three times anywhere in a story (or selecting a menuoption) brings up a new window that displays an unformatted view of thatstory.andP;  In this window, you may edit freely and rapidly; the computer'sresponse is not slowed down by the need to repaint the page.andP;  Many storiescan be opened at once, each in their separate windows.andP;  A new &quot;windows&quot; menuallows switching between stories and the publication.andM;While you are editing the story in the active window, the story will begrayed out on the page.andP;  As soon as you close the edit window or switch toanother window, the story will be recomposed and the page will be repaintedif it is visible on the screen.andM;The edit window initially opens to the full size of screen.andP;  You can resizethis window to view as many items as will fit on your screen.andP;  When you closea story window and reopen it, the window will appear in the same place at theat same size you closed it.andP;  This was particularly handy for us working ontwo screens; we kept the pages on the large monitor and called the stories upon the smaller one.andM;With this word processor users can search and replace words, phrases, fonts,point sizes or paragraph formats in one story, or in all the storiesthroughout the publication.andP;  We found it helpful, for example, to changeevery occurrence of The Seybold Report from regular to italic text.andP;  Anothertip is to change all hyphens, imported from a word processor, to yourfavorite Zapf Dingbat character (a good work-around for anyone who hastrouble importing bullets or other special characters).andM;International dictionaries.andP;  As an international marketer, Aldus offers 11optional language dictionaries from Proximity.andP;  Foreign languages availableare: British English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Swedish, Danish,Norwegian, Dutch, Portuguese and Brazilian, as well as medical and legaldictionaries.andP;  You can use all 12 within the same document by assigningdifferent dictionaries to different paragraphs.andP;  PageMaker will switch to theappropriate dictionary so that you can check the spelling of an entiremultilingual document in one pass.andP;  The 100,000-word English dictionary alsocontains a subset of technical and scientific terms.andM;The dictionary automatically and quickly offers alternatives.andP;  If you ignorea word (like WYSIWYG) the checker stores it to a temporary dictionary andwill not call it up again as an error.andP;  Or you can easily customize yourdictionary by adding words, including a ~ for hyphenation.andP;  A thesaurus ismissing, but a good desk accessory can compensate for now.andM;The windows menu also better groups the color and style palettes, tool boxand scroll bars.andM;Enhanced typographical controlandM;Aldus has not been aggressive in putting fancy features into PageMaker justfor the sake of having features that competitors don't have.andP;  Instead, ittries hard to listen to its customer base and has always focused on qualitycomposition, reliability of results and ease of use.andM;You can now set type in sizes from 4 to 650 points, in increments of 0.1 of apoint.andP;  Leading can be specified in increments of 0.1 of a point.andP;  Currentpoint size appears bold in the leading menu.andP;  Coupled with increased leadingcontrol is the new vertical ruler option.andP;  The vertical ruler can becustomized to match your leading.andP;  This new ruler option coupled with the&quot;snap to rulers&quot; option is great for lining up and balancing text.andP;  In ourcase we set it at 11 points.andM;Finally, text can be rotated!andP;  How many people have ever asked themselveswhy, after spending thousands of dollars on an electronic paste-up system,they were manually cutting and pasting a return address on a brochure?andP;  Ifyou don't already use a desk accessory to rotate type, you will appreciatePageMaker's new ability to rotate type at intervals of 90 degrees.andP;  The textcan still be edited using the story editor.andP;  We would like to see moreincrements than just 90 degrees.andM;Hyphenation.andP;  There are three options: manual, manual plus dictionary andmanual plus algorithm (which includes use of the dictionary).andP;  You can addwords to the dictionary as well as set the maximum number of consecutivelines that may be hyphenated.andP;  Once again, these values can be setindividually for each style.andP;  Headlines can be set for no hyphenation, whilebody text can be set to a maximum of three hyphenated lines in a row.andP;  Sincethe hyphenation dictionary is the same one used for spelling checking, youhave the same options for foreign, medical or legal text.andM;For ragged composition, a hyphenation zone can be set up to increase ordecrease the frequency of hyphenation.andM;Indents and tabs.andP;  Several minor details have been improved to give all of uswho work with tabs in PageMaker a sigh of relief.andM;* The tab ruler now automatically lines up with the column, but you can'tstretch it to the width of the column.andM;* You can change attribute of a tab before or after it has been assigned alocation.andM;* You can enter a numeric value rather than fighting to place the tab arrowon the ruler in the right place.andM;* You can repeat tabs equidistant across a column.andM;There are still only two spaces available for custom leaders.andM;Space adjustments.andP;  A few features have been added to kerning.andP;  Pair kerning(built into each font) can still be set to automatic above X amount ofpoints.andP;  Manual kerning can now be applied in coarse increments (1/25 of anem) with the command and arrow keys or in fine increments (1/100 of and em)with the shift plus command and arrow keys.andP;  White space addition orreduction can be set over a range of text by selecting the text first, thenpressing the desired key sequences.andP;  Custom kern pairs cannot be added,although you could use LetrTuck from Edco.andM;Aldus has added a tracking facility.andP;  Tracking refers to automatic whitespace addition or reduction based on point sizes.andP;  Larger point sizes usuallyrequire tighter setting than body copy, and small type may need additionalwhite space to improve legibility.andP;  Aldus has provided five preset tracks,ranging from very tight to very loose (see samples above).andM;Additional tracking can be applied manually over any range of text.andP;  Trackingretains any kerning adjustments.andP;  There is also a neat option in thepreferences box that highlights lines that are looser than the maximum usersspecification.andM;The tracks are based on an algorithm for each of the fonts present in theLaserWriter Plus.andP;  They are based on the most commonly used settings and arefixed; there is no way to set your own values, as you can, for example, inDesignStudio.andM;There are third-party track and kern editors in the works.andP;  PM Tracker fromEdco Services allows customization of PageMaker's five preset tracks andkerning values in all sizes and styles of fonts.andP;  Tracking can be calculatedbased on 1/10 of a percent.andP;  Kerning can be adjusted up to 1/2000 of an em.andO;Available with the release of 4.0, it will cost $99.andM;The new set width option, which Quark has had since 1987, expands to 250% orcondenses type to 5%.andM;A force justify command has been added to allow justification of linescontaining as few as two letters.andP;  This helps get lines of differentspecifications to line up left to right.andP;  Force justify spreads out lettersor words.andM;FORCEandM;JustificationandM;Small caps, super- and subscripts.andP;  Under the options button in the typespecs dialog box, the size and positioning of super- and subscript characterscan now be assigned as a percentage of point size.andP;  The overall size, but notheight and width separately, can be preset for small caps.andP;  These values canbe different for each block of text or style sheet.andP;  Small caps appear aslower case letters in the story editor.andM;There are no automated provisions for fractions or equations, but you canimport them as inline graphics or use the new super- and subscript controlsin the meantime.andM;Although there are many new typographical controls, once reserved only fortype houses, Aldus still feels the need to compromise.andP;  To keep its userinterface easy to learn and use, Aldus typically argues that it does not wantto give the average users more than they will need--or understand.andP;  Forexample, Aldus chose five of the most common numerical tracking ranges andtranslated them into simple terms.andP;  But for users who understand tracking,why not offer a sixth option that allows users to fill in their own value?andO;People who crave absolute numeric control will continue to be frustrated byAldus.andM;Tables editorandM;Aldus signed an OEM agreement with the now-defunct Mansfield Systems companyfor a version of its Table Tools package.andP;  The Table editor is a separateutility in which you can create neatly organized tables (rows and columns)for export as text or as a PICT file.andP;  It's modeled after a spreadsheet,which calls for each row and column entry.andP;  It is intuitively simple, evenfor people unfamiliar with spreadsheets.andP;  You can enter numeric values orsize the cells visually using the mouse.andM;The beta version we tested was not fully functional so we could not importany files or test its text characteristics, but it is designed toautomatically size calls to fit text.andP;  We were able to view the optionsavailable and they appeared complete and useful.andP;  Users can align text withincells left, right or justified as well as top, middle or bottom.andP;  Cells canbe grouped together up, down or both.andM;We were able to size cells by entering values or by dragging the guide lines.andO;When we enlarged a column (or row) by moving a guide line, the neighboringcolumn became smaller, thereby maintaining the overall size of the table.andP;  Bypressing the option key and sizing a column, all other columns maintain theirsize and the overall dimensions of the table changed to accommodate the newcolumn size.andM;The menus and feel of it are similar to PageMaker.andP;  For example, the samelines and fill characteristics from PageMaker can be applied to any or all ofthe cells.andP;  We did manage to import a table with no text but with varyingsize cells with line borders into a PageMaker document.andP;  The lines appearedperfect, and we could alter it to any shape or sizes as well as embed it asan inline graphic, centered in this column.andM;The table editor should provide an answer to those endless hours of drawingrules, zooming in to get them to butt and then fighting with the tabs tocorrespond to the rules.andP;  We liked this very useful and handy addition,despite the fact that you do have to exit PageMaker.andP;  If you import it intext format you can edit on the page, but the borders will not import.andP;  Ifyou import it in PICT format you have to edit it in the table editor andupdate the link.andP;  The advantage to this is that you can easily size it to anyshape to fit your space.andM;Cutting, pasting and rotatingandM;Previously, when you cut (or copied) and pasted an element it would appear inthe center of the screen.andP;  With the new version the pasted element appears inthe same space as the original element.andM;Again this is a minor detail with important implications.andP;  You can move pagesmore easily by selecting an entire page and copying it to another page,maintaining the exact positioning.andP;  This is also very helpful when you wantto break up a text block--simply cut and paste, no more repositioning.andM;For some, it may be confusing at first if you are duplicating something andcan't tell how many copies are superimposed upon each other.andM;Unfortunately, you still can't rotate graphics on the page; for example,drawing a PageMaker box for a photo and rotating it (and a caption) 20degrees.andM;Color ExtensionandM;With 4.0, Aldus is bundling Color Extension--its spot-color and tintmodule--into the basic PageMaker product, raising the basic price ofPageMaker from $695 to $795.andP;  Color Extension was a $195 option.andM;This move is a direct counter to Quark and Letraset, both of which are nowoffering color support within their basic Xpress and DesignStudio products.andM;Color Extension includes a license from Pantone for PageMaker to use the PMScolor palette for creating and assigning tints to graphics or text.andM;PageMaker will output a file in OPI format.andP;  This enables you to send adocument to a high-end prepress system that has an OPI interface.andP;  To datethe vendors that have announced their intentions to offer an OPI interfaceinclude Crosfield, Diadem, Hell, Howtek and Networked Picture Systems.andP;  Thisinterface enables you to specify cropping and sizing information for imagefiles that will be substituted by the high-end system.andM;ConclusionandM;As we noted at the beginning, version 4.0 of PageMaker keeps Aldus in thethick of the features race against Quark and LetraSet and it also makessignificant strides in the race to catch up with Ventura Publisher inhandling long documents.andP;  On the former question, we may have a more accuratescore after we complete our comparison in our next issue.andM;Regarding long documents, when Aldus entered the starting gate with 3.0nearly two years ago, we said that it wouldn't encroach on Ventura at all.andO;We think 4.0 will begin to change that situation with features such asin-line graphics and rules, more complete style sheets, widow/orphan control,forced page/column breaks and &quot;keep with&quot; for headlines and tables.andM;The indexing capability is one of the best we've ever seen.andP;  The &quot;book&quot;grouping and link management features should prove to be very welcome inmulti-user environments, provided the appropriate safeguards are in place.andO;(We know Aldus is aware of our concern and we look forward to its next move.)andM;Many long-document features have been added but some key ones aremissing--floating illustrations, footnotes, straddle heads, column balancing,automatic fractions.andP;  We don't know if or when Aldus plans to add any ofthese, but these are necessary in certain circumstances.andM;Also useful for long-document production--as well as for everybody else--isthe story editor with its spelling checker and its text/format search andreplace function.andP;
