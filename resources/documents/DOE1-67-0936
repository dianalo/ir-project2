It isthis consultation with the traditional religious leaders, either directlyor through surrogates, that is the ultimate objective in complying withAIRFA. When a federal agency finds, upon consultation, that its proposedaction would deny the free exercise of religion and yet determines thatthere is a compelling need for the action, the decision to proceed maybe made, but appropriate mitigation measures to reduce religious interferenceto the lowest possible level must be included.</TEXT></DOC>
