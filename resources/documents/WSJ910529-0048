Chrysler would be able to add the extra shift wheneversales demand supported the added production with &quot;modestadditional capital investment,&quot; said David W. Kempken, vicepresident of human resources at Chrysler Canada.</LP><TEXT>   The third shift would allow Chrysler to increase annualproduction of minivans at its Windsor assembly plant by up to86,000 units and at its Bramalea car plant by up to 63,000additional cars. With two shifts, the plants can produce275,000 and 260,000 units, respectively.   The Bramalea plant is scheduled to begin production ofChrysler's new code-named LH passenger car in mid-1992. TheLH cars are considered vital to Chrysler's future.   The Canadian Auto Workers Union said the &quot;groundbreaking&quot;agreement &quot;in effect . . . means Canadian assembly operationsare now singularly vital to the future of Chrysler.&quot;   The union said the additional shift would add about 2,400new jobs at the two plants. Under the agreement, workerswould receive eight hours of pay for seven hours of work whenthe third shift is running.   Bramalea plant workers will vote on the agreement on June2 with Windsor employees voting in late June.</TEXT></DOC>
