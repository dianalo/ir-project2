Activitiesin the different parts of the fuel cycle represent an industry in itself.Such activities require a large investment and a long lead time. Therefore,IAEA assistance in these fields is generally limited to the introductionand upgrading of the required knowledge and technology including thesetting up of the basic infrastructure to initiate the necessary researchor investigation. National training courses were organized as a componentof on-going Agency technical co-operation projects. Today, five courseshave been organized in uranium exploration and evaluation (Indonesiain 1984, Syria in 1985, Turkey in 1986, China in 1987, and Jordan in1988). A large part of training was carried out through the Agency'sfellowship and scientific visit programme. The number of applicants fortraining abroad under this field of activities ranges from 50-80 annually;more than two-thirds are generally in the areas of uranium exploration,mining, and ore processing. One main difficulty in trying to implementthis programme is the limited number of willing host organizations forthe increasing number of candidates. This problem is becoming criticalin the uranium field as exploration and development in traditionallyactive countries has been drastically reduced in recent years. Priorityselection through stricter screening by the applying organization isessential.</TEXT></DOC>
