TRIMSthereafter to tighten.^By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Iran said today that it will accept aU.N. resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in its nearly8-year-old war with Iraq, which has claimed an estimated 1 millionlives.   However, Iran also said it will not withdraw its troops from itsborders and called on Iranians to prepare to thwart further Iraqiattacks.   The announcement came one day after President Saddam Hussein ofIraq cited his country's recent string of battlefield victories andurged Iran to accept an ``honorable'' peace. Iraq, which hasalready accepted the year-old U.N. resolution, said today itremained skeptical about Iran's intentions.   President Reagan's spokesman welcomed the move but said theUnited States must remain cautious.   In a message to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,Iran said it accepts cease-fire Resolution 598 in the ``interestsof security on the basis of justice,'' the official IslamicRepublic News Agency said.   In New York, Perez de Cuellar said he had received a letter fromPresident Ali Khamenei of Iran saying Tehran accepted thecease-fire resolution. The secretary-general said Iran accepted theresolution unconditionally.   ``They say that they have decided to officially declare that therepublic of Iran accepts Security Council Resolution 598,'' Perezde Cuellar said. ``It is very clear that it is an acceptance whichdoesn't refer to any conditions.''   Iran did not say when the cease-fire would go into effect.However, the secretary-general said he would begin consultationswith Iran and Iraq as early as today to arrange a cease-fire.   The Iranian news agency quoted a statement by the GeneralCommand of the Iranian Armed Forces, formed recently by Ali AkbarHashemi Rafsanjani after the speaker of the parliament was madeacting commander of Iran's armed forces.   Iran's acceptance of the resolution appeared to reflect afurther strengthening of the position of Rafsanjani, who isregarded as a pragmatist.   In a speech last month, Rafsanjani referred to the possibilityof ``non-military solutions to the war.'' In an extraordinarycomment, he also suggested recently that the time had come for Iranto emerge from the international isolation caused largely by theIran-Iraq war.   Nevertheless, Rafsanjani said in an interview on Iran televisiontoday the decision to accept the resolution was made by AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini, Iran's undisputed leader. The 88-year-oldKhomeini announced the decision to top Iranian leaders during ameeting on Sunday, Rafsanjani said.   Iraq responded skeptically to the announcement, saying Iran hadaccepted the U.N. resolution out of tactical reasons and not adesire for peace.   ``Our previous knowledge of the devious Iranian regime makes usbe cautious and wary until peace is achieved and until we reach anagreement between Iran and Iraq for peace,'' Iraqi InformationMinister Nassif Ltayyif Jassem said in Baghdad. Jassem, who wasquoted by the Iraqi News Agency, said his government still had notbeen informed officially of the Iranian move.   In Santa Barbara, Calif., President Reagan's spokesman saidtoday the United States welcomes Iran's willingness to accept thecease-fire resolution.   But spokesman Marlin Fitzwater added, ``I think we have to becautious'' because U.S. officials are unsure of the preciseconditions of Iran's agreement to U.N. Resolution 598. ``We don'tknow what their intentions are,'' he said.   Fitzwater refused to say whether Iran's move would lead to alowering of the U.S. military profile in the Persian Gulf, but hesaid Washington has been prepared to terminate tanker escortoperations if peace came to the region.   The United States maintains a fleet of 27 ships in and aroundthe Persian Gulf to protect neutral shipping from war-relatedattacks.   In a report monitored in Nicosia, the Iranian news agency said,``Today new conditions have been created which call for adoption ofnew stances in order to continue the sacred defense and protectIslam,'' IRNA said.   ``We once again urge the Iranian people to man the war fronts toconfront the enemies' aggressive nature and foil their criminalacts,'' the General Command of the Armed Forces said. ``All Muslimcombatants deployed on the war fronts are prepared to respond toany aggression and movement of the enemy.''   IRNA said the cease-fire acceptance was part of a strategy ofdefending the Islamic Revolution that toppled the government ofShah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979. It said the Iranian positionshould not be interpreted as caving in to pressure from the UnitedStates and Iraq.   In the past three months, Iraq has recaptured nearly all theterritory it lost to Iran over the past six years. There has beenno official casualty toll in the war, but foreign analysts put itat more than 1 million.   One of the conditions for the U.N. cease-fire was that bothcountries return to their borders at the time the war started in1980. The resolution also calls for an exchange of prisoners anddetermination of who was responsible for starting the war.   Iran had demanded that Iraq be labeled the aggressor before itaccepted the resolution. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 afterborder skirmishes.   In addition to its battlefield defeats, the Tehran governmenthas found it increasingly difficult to recruit soldiers and keepits economy afloat.   In April, the Iraqis began recapturing territory lost to Iranand claim they have since seized about 133 strategic heights in thenorthern region of the 730-mile long front.   They also launched assaults in the south that recaptured thesouthern Faw peninsula in April and the Shalamcheh and Majnoonislands in May and June.   The war prompted a heightened U.S. military presence in thePersian Gulf.   Last year, the U.S. Navy began escorting 11 Kuwaiti tankers thathad been reflagged with the Stars and Stripes. The Navy laterexpanded its protection to neutral commercial vessels thatrequested help after coming under attack.   On July 3, the cruiser USS Vincennes mistook an Iranian jetlinerfor a warplane and shot it down, killing all 290 people aboard.   In May 1987, Iraqi aircraft fired missiles at USS Stark, killing37 American serviceman. Iraq said the attack was a mistake andapologized.   Iran sought a Security Council emergency hearing on the airlinerattack and during debate last week, but the council has so farrefused to condemn the United States for the attack.   During the debate, nation after nation on the 15-member councilurged Iran to accept the cease-fire resolution. Those nationsincluded the Soviet Union, Britain, France, China, Japan and WestGermany.   Debate on the airliner tragedy was to resume today. The SecurityCouncil is expected to issue a resolution or statement on theattack.   Iran's presence at the Security Council meeting was its firstappearance at the council, which it has boycotted since thebeginning of the Iran-Iraq.   Hussein, in his speech Sunday, proposed that Iran and Iraq signa peace accord, exchange prisoners, return to their respectiveborders and vow not to interfere in each other's internal affairs.   In addition to recent territorial losses, the Iranian populationsuffered a severe psychological blow in the so-called ``war of thecities'' between Feb. 29 and April 21.   As many as half of Tehran's 6 million population fled to thecountryside to escape the missiles that blasted a path ofdestruction across the city.   The Iranians were clearly outgunned. The Iraqis fired nearly 200long-range missiles, believed to be upgraded Soviet Scud weapons.The Iranians were only able to fire one-third that number inretaliation.</TEXT></DOC>
