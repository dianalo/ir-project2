China is in line to receive $62 million in radio and radar equipment. The planned transaction would be the third major military sale to the Chinese since 1984. The last U.S. sales consisted of $550 million of aircraft radar and avionics equipment.    Egypt would receive 90 M-113 tanks, for $27 million along with $41 million of howitzer projectiles. The tanks are produced by FMC Corp.    The U.S. plans to sell Spain 80 Harm missiles, along with parts and training support, for $42 million. Harm missiles are designed to destroy enemy radars. In addition, Spain would receive 20 Harpoon air-to-surface missiles, along with parts and training support, for $26 million.    Greece would receive four Phalanx gun systems for $56 million. The weapon is designed to protect naval vessels from low-flying missiles.    Turkey would receive $86 million of spare parts for eight U.S.-made aircraft in the Turkish fleet.    Britain would receive $24 million of computer equipment to strengthen its ocean-surveillance equipment.    The proposed military sales, which aren't expected to encounter significant opposition, have been building up during the holiday congressional recess because the Pentagon doesn't initiate such sales when Congress isn't in session. Each of the transactions will go through automatically unless Congress blocks it during the next 30 days. </TEXT></DOC>
