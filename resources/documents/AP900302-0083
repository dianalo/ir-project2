DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The slide of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. intobankruptcy court is not an indication that U.S. securities marketsare unsound, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commissionsaid today.   ``Drexel was uniquely concentrated among large securities firmsin high-yield securities and that concentration proved to be fatalwhen these securities became unmarketable and unpledgeable,''Chairman Richard C. Breeden told a Senate hearing.   Drexel's insolvency ``should not be taken as an indication thatU.S. securities markets, or other major participants in thosemarkets are financially unsound,'' he testified before the SenateBanking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.   Breedon noted that Drexel's $28 billion business has beenreduced by about 75 percent since its parent company, DrexelBurnham Lambert Group, filed for bankruptcy protection, ``and thepublic was not called upon to pay the creditors of Drexel'sunregulated operations.''   He called for passage of a market-reform act which would givefederal regulators information on the holding companies ofsecurities firms such as Drexel which are not now subject togovernment oversight. Such legislation, he said, would go a longway toward preventing situations similar to Drexel's.   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, Jr., chairman of the Senate committee,has said he wants to know what lessons can be learned from Drexel'ssituation and whether it calls for regulation of the funds flowingbetween a broker-dealer and its parent company.   On Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan toldanother congressional committee that Wall Street's ho-hum reactionto Drexel's collapse showed regulators were right to let thesecurities firm fail.   ``Our concern was not with the fortunes of a particular firm''but with ``the orderly operation of the financial markets,''Greenspan said.   Drexel, once the fifth-largest securities company in the nation,sought bankruptcy protection in the wake of a sharp drop in thevalue of its high-yield, high-risk junk bond portfolio and itsadmission of securities law violations in a plea bargain withfederal prosecutors.   Its parent company sought court protection from creditors underthe federal bankruptcy law on Feb. 13 after defaulting on $100million in short-term debt. It has listed more than 2,000 creditorsand nearly $3 billion in liabilities.   Despite Drexel's once towering position on Wall Street, thestock market took its troubles in stride. The Dow Jones average of30 industrial stocks fell 29.06 points to 2624.10 on Feb. 12, theday Drexel announced its distress. It rose 4.96 points thefollowing day, when Drexel's parent filed for bankruptcy.   ``This market reaction tends to validate the judgment that thefailure of Drexel, while a tragedy for the many involved, did notpresent undue risks to the orderly functioning of the financialsystem or the economy,'' said Greenspan in testimony before theHouse Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on economic and commerciallaw.</TEXT></DOC>
