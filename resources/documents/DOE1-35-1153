It is important to pointout that even if these results are the best ever obtained in the laboratory,they are representative of the authors level of control concerning thegrowth. Numerous layers with the same composition exhibit very similarresults. A new Hg cell, which is a prototype built by ISA - Riber, iscurrently being tested. This cell gives a very stable Hg flux duringhours of growth. It should be noted that both mobility and carrier concentrationvalues are suitable for IR device application.</TEXT></DOC>
