Stock prices seesawed in a narrow range but began a moredecisive move upward in midafternoon. Nervousness surrounding theTreasury's sale of $10.25 billion in 30-year bonds was alleviatedwhen the government received $25.96 billion in bids for the issues.   ``When the results of the auction were released, the bondfutures rallied and took the stock market along,'' said Alfred E.Goldman, a vice president at St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards andamp; SonsInc.   The market was particularly nervous about the auction, whichmade up the final leg of a three-part record refunding, becauseWednesday's sale of 10-year notes went off poorly.   Traders said much of the day's activity centered on retail andenergy stocks. The nation's major stores reported mixed July sales,and oil stocks continued to attract attention as U.S. forces tookup defensive positions in Saudi Arabia to protect the world'slargest oil exporter.   Traders believe the presence of U.S. forces there will deterfurther aggressive moves by Iraq. But they assumed a wait-and-seeattitude as Arab leaders gathered in Cairo for a high-stakes summiton Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
