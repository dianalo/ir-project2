Swindall Is Facing Charges Of Lying at Inquiry </HL><AUTHOR> Andy Pasztor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BNK </IN><G> CNG JUS </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rep. Patrick Swindall (R., Ga.) was charged with lying to a federal grand jury investigating an alleged money-laundering ring.    A federal grand jury in Atlanta accused the 38-year-old two-term lawmaker of withholding information and trying to mislead the government's inquiry into his private financial activities.    Specifically, the 10-count indictment charges that Rep. Swindall lied to the grand jury last February to conceal his planned participation in an illegal $850,000 loan arrangement proposed by a federal undercover agent and involving a former Atlanta businessman. The indictment charged the lawmaker knew, but failed to disclose to the grand jury, that the aim of the loan was to launder funds.    According to the indictment, a government undercover agent warned the lawmaker in September 1987 that his &quot;gut feeling {was} there are narcotics dollars&quot; involved in the loan.    The indictment also charges that in September 1987 Mr. Swindall accepted and endorsed for deposit into his personal bank account a check for $150,000 of the proposed $850,000 loan; Mr. Swindall never received the rest of the loan.    Mr. Swindall, who faces a maximum of 50 years in prison and a $100,000 fine if convicted on all the charges, has maintained he didn't engage in any illegal activity.    While Rep. Swindall left the campaign trail for his arraignment, a spokesman said the lawmaker &quot;knows he has done nothing wrong and looks forward to a chance to clear his name.&quot; Just two weeks ago, Mr. Swindall made a speech on the House floor urging the Justice Department to indict him so he would have enough time to go to trial before the November election. Prosecutors said Mr. Swindall is scheduled to go to trial Monday.    Meanwhile, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is scaling back a two-month-old Justice Department order calling for independent prosecutors to handle cases involving alleged wrongdoing by members of Congress; such cases are handled by U.S. attorneys and the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section. The order, signed by Edwin Meese before he stepped down as attorney general, spells out specific procedures and timetables for such inquiries.    Officials said Mr. Thornburgh is expected within the next two weeks to announce his conclusion that most of Mr. Meese's order is unnecessary. </TEXT></DOC>
