Will the engineered genetic change modify environmentallyrelevant characteristics of the organism? What will be the consequencesof adding a new species (or genotype) to an ecological community? Canadded genes spread to other organisms, and what would be the consequencesof spreading? The answers to these questions would provide a sound basisfor risk assessment. There is, however, uncertainty about how to getsuch answers because of gaps in knowledge of ecology, microbial biologyand ecology, and genetics.</TEXT></DOC>
