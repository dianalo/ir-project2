Firefighters reported progress against dozens of mostlylightning-caused blazes in Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Utah andCalifornia.   ``The temperatures have been lowering, the humidity has beencoming up,'' said Rebecca Burkhead of the Boise Interagency FireCenter, the nation's wildfire command post. ``That's really givenus a handle on a lot of the fires.''   The fire center replaced its long-running forecast for drylightning with a prediction of showers, lower temperatures andhigher humidity across the West.   Still, 23,000 firefighters were battling blazes on 160,000 acresof timber and range. More than 220,000 acres have been charred inmostly lightning-caused fires since July 26.   Western and central Idaho were still the hardest hit, with 15major forest fires burning out of control over 104,000 acres. About9,200 firefighters in Idaho, including hundreds of military troops,cut fire lines in the rain.   ``This by no means puts fires out, and it can give people afalse sense of security,'' Payette National Forest Supervisor SonnyLaSalle said. ``But what it will do is give us the opportunity toget a lot of line built, get some mop-up done and increase thesecurity around some of these fires.''   About one-third of an inch of rain was reported Tuesday atLowman, a small mountain community 70 miles north of Boisevirtually leveled by fire 10 days earlier. Several dozen residentswere allowed to return home.   Bob and Margie Carr's house was spared but everything around itburned.   ``The quietness and the peacefulness will come back, but thescenery is gone,'' said Carr. ``It hurts to see this happen, butit's happened and you can't do a thing about it.''   Progress was reported 30 miles to the north, where 2,400firefighters, including 600 soldiers from Colorado, battled the18,400-acre Warm Lake fire complex.   With higher humidity clearing the air of dense smoke, ArmyBlackhawk helicopters supplemented Forest Service airpower on firesstill threatening the small town of Warren, about 120 miles northof Boise.   Resource losses in Idaho are estimated at more than $75 millionsince a July 26 lightning storm scored the state's backcountry with40,000 strikes, which sparked hundreds of wildfires.   The 10,000-acre Emmett Mountain Complex and the 7,000-acreSummit fire in the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, on theborder with Oregon, should be contained by Thursday, said ThomCorcoran of the Northwest Interagency Coordinating Center inPortland, Ore.   About 3,500 lightning strikes across Oregon started severalfires in the Siskiyou National Forest and a Bureau of LandManagement district in the southwest corner of the state, but rainlimited their size.   The biggest fire in eastern Oregon, the 23,350-acre Canal fire,was declared contained Tuesday evening, Corcoran said.   Calmer, cooler weather helped firefighters contain Washington'slargest wildfire, a 2,500-acre blaze on the Colville IndianReservation.   Crews by Tuesday had contained two southern California fires,the 15,300-acre Vail fire in Cleveland National Forest and the7,500-acre Balch fire in Sierra National Forest.   Officials at the Chalk Creek fire, about 45 miles east of SaltLake City, released half the crews mopping up the 1,700-acre blaze.</TEXT></DOC>
