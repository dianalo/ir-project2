The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported late Wednesday that thering was after sophisticated warship electronics slated for a newgeneration of Canadian naval frigates. It said the sonar, radar andcommunications equipment is made by Paramax Electronics ofMontreal, a subsidiary of Unisys Corp. of Detroit.   The New York Times today quoted unidentified Canadian officialsas saying Paramax had access to classified technology includingequipment that controls weapons systems aboard U.S. Navy ships.      The Canadian Security Intelligence Service, which monitored theactivities of the eight Soviet diplomats and officials expelledlast week and nine others barred from re-entering Canada, would notconfirm the link with Paramax.   But spokesman Jerry Cummings told The Associated Press today:``It wasn't one single operation _ some of these operations havebeen over four or five years.''   At Paramax offices in Montreal, the company said no one wasavailable to comment on the incident.   Foreign Minister Joe Clark told Parliament Wednesday thatCanadian authorities had prevented any severe security breach.   The Soviet government expelled two Canadian diplomats inretaliation Wednesday and said three others currently out of thecountry would not be allowed back.      Spokesman Viatcheslav Bogdanov of the Soviet Embassy in Ottawatermed the expulsions from Canada ``a provocation.''   ``These people were not doing anything wrong,'' he said.   Clark and other government officials declined to provide detailsof the Soviets' activities, though Clark said they includedattempts to infiltrate national security intelligence agencies.   The CBC said one of the Soviets expelled was a naval attache atthe Soviet embassy in Ottawa and was ``caught red-handed in asting'' operation.   It connected his expulsion to the arrest earlier this month of aCanadian of Hungarian descent, Stephen Ratkai, who was charged withattempting to obtain classified U.S. military documents from theArgentia U.S. naval base in Newfoundland. The base monitors Sovietsubmarine movements in the Atlantic.   The CBC also said parts for the new Canadian frigates were onceshipped on a Soviet freighter, and Soviet agents took theopportunity to examine them.   Clark announced that a Soviet defector, Yuri Smurov, hadprovided ``useful information'' in connection with the expulsionsand has asked to stay in Canada with his family.   The CBC said Smurov, a translator at the International CivilAviation Organization in Montreal, was a Canadian double agent who``identified most of the Soviet intelligence agents.''   In December 1987, Paramax was awarded the first part of a $950million contract to build the combat systems for six new Canadianfrigates. The company, which was established in 1983, had alreadybeen working on the weapons systems and electronics for six otherCanadian frigates.   At the time, Minister of National Defense Perrin Beatty termedthe order ``the first concrete example of the implementation'' ofCanada's ambitious plans to improve its military.   The report that the Soviets were seeking information on theCanadian frigates appears significant because NATO allies haverecently moved to standardize much of their frigate-buildingtechnology.   Paramax is a subsidiary of Unisys, which was formed in 1986 whenBurroughs Copr. took over Sperry Corp. in a $4.8 billion deal.   Unisys is a leading defense contractor in the United States. InJune, Datamation magazine ranked it the third biggest computercompany nationwide with revenues in that area of more than $8.5billion.</TEXT></DOC>
