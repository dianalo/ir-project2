Of necessity, they were largely vegetarians. Reproductivecycles were keyed to rainfall patterns. High density populations hadhigh stress indices, including high parasite loads. The rats, at thetop of the terrestrial food pyramid, constituted a bioenvironmental monitorthat was rarely utilized during the several test programs. Bioconcentrationof radioisotopes, especially {sup 137}Cs and {sup 60}Co, occurred; ratsimplanted with dosimeters were determined to function as environmentalradiation monitors. They hypothesized that roof rats on Enjebi survivedthe nearby nuclear detonation. Analysis of plasma transferrins indicatedgreater heterozygosity in the northern atoll rat populations. The incidenceof oral palatal ridge deformations also was positively correlated withenvironmental radiation levels, but other gross indications of radiationeffect were not found.</TEXT></DOC>
