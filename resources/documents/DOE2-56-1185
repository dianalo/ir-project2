The kinetic layer considered consists ofa uniform density, uniform temperature slab model in which the equilibriummagnetic field is oriented in the z-italic-circumflex direction and varieslinearly in the x-italic-circumflex direction. An equivalent dielectrictensor, as well as a two-dimensional energy conservation equation, arederived from the linearized Vlasov--Maxwell system of equations. A generalized,but approximate form of the mode conversion-tunneling equation is thenextracted from the Maxwell equations, using the parabolic approximationmethod in which transverse variations of the wave fields are assumedto be weak in comparison to the variations in the primary direction ofpropagation. Numerical solutions of this approximate wave equation agreewell with solutions to the exact wave equation within the kinetic layer.</TEXT></DOC>
