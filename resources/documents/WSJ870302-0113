Joy, which plans to go private in a previously announced leveraged buyout valued at $620 million, also said that all directors but one have resigned. Joy said the remaining director, Robert Dickey III, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Dravo Corp., will be one of five members of the new Joy board.    The other four directors will be Roy Wennerholm Jr., chairman, president and chief executive of Ecolaire Inc., who will be Joy's chairman, president and chief executive; Edmund J. Freeman, vice president and controller of Ecolaire, who will be Joy's vice president and chief financial officer; Leonard P. Shaykin, and John G. Quigley. Messrs. Shaykin and Quigley are partners in Adler andamp; Shaykin, a New York investment firm, which on Feb. 18 completed the purchase of about 16.7 million Joy common shares through a tender offer that began Dec. 24. The changes in the Joy board had been anticipated.    Closely held Ecolaire is a Malvern, Pa.-based maker of equipment for utilities and other industries.    Joy, a producer of capital equipment and associated services for coal mining and other industries, expects the merger to take effect next month.    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. The debt ultimately is paid through the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
