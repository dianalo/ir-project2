With most of the votes counted, Mr. Bush was winning by amargin of about 57%-41% over conservative challenger PatrickBuchanan, whose surprisingly strong showing in the GOPprimary indicated an erosion of support for the president andhis administration, especially among male voters.</LP><TEXT>   In the Democratic race, former Massachusetts Sen. PaulTsongas and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas were running34%-26%. Mr. Tsongas's success validates his claim to betaken seriously as a contender for the Democratic nominationbut Mr. Clinton's finish ensures that he will continue. Heappeared to run well among core, working class Democraticvoters and his strength makes it vastly more difficult foranother major candidate to jump into the race.   The other contenders, Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and TomHarkin of Iowa and former California Gov. Jerry Brown, wereall bunched far down the list. The write-in campaign for NewYork Gov. Mario Cuomo appeared to have fizzled: Exit pollsindicated that he wasn't doing much better than activistRalph Nader, another write-in candidate.   Even before the polls closed, Bush operatives were fanningout to spread the word that any victory margin over Mr.Buchanan would satisfy them. But such claims rang hollow. Itappeared the Mr. Buchanan would gain about the samepercentage of the vote as did Sen. Eugene McCarthy in 1968,when President Lyndon Johnson's margin of victory as awrite-in candidate was so slim that he was ultimately drivenfrom the race.   The last incumbent president to be so strongly challengedin New Hampshire was Gerald Ford in 1976, and his victory byless than two percentage points over a candidate far moreformidable than Mr. Buchanan, Ronald Reagan, foreshadoweddefeat in the fall.   &quot;We're very disappointed by these results,&quot; said ThomasRath, a Bush campaign adviser in Concord. &quot;It indicates thatthere's a lot to be done. Nothing can be taken for grantedfrom here on out.&quot;   In a statement released by the White House last night, Mr.Bush said he was &quot;delighted&quot; with the victory butacknowledged the &quot;election was far closer than many hadpredicted.&quot;   &quot;I think the opponents on both sides reaped the harvest ofdiscontent with the pace of New Hampshire's economy. Iunderstand the message of dissatisfaction,&quot; Mr. Bush said.&quot;The message of tonight is that Americans are concerned aboutthe future. I have the right answers and I will take my caseto the voters in the next eight and a half months.&quot;   For Republicans and Democrats alike, the New Hampshirereturns demonstrate the impact of the economy this year andthe alienation among voters toward Washington. Mr. Buchanan,a TV commentator, political columnist and former White Houseaide, recast himself as a rebel outsider and true protectorof his party's conservative heritage. He planted himself inNew Hampshire after announcing his candidacy only 10 weeksago and waged a whirlwind campaign that never failed toremind voters that until he came &quot;those people in Washingtonbehaved as if they did not care.&quot;   In a final motorcade across the state, his speeches werelaced with references to New England's role in the AmericanRevolution two centuries ago. And his stump appeals meldedwith an expensive, blistering television campaign thatpainted Mr. Bush as conciliatory toward congressionalliberals and forgetful of those who first put him in theWhite House.   In his two-fisted style, Mr. Buchanan derided the Bushforces as royalists routed by Yankee voters. &quot;My friends, didI not tell you we would make history,&quot; said the conservative.&quot;We're going to make more history. We are going to take ourparty back from those who have walked away from us.&quot;   &quot;The thing that happened here is that Buchanan ran a damngood campaign, and I respect him for it,&quot; said Hugh Gregg, aformer Republican New Hampshire governor and adviser to theBush campaign. &quot;I know a good campaign when I see it, andthis was a very good campaign.&quot;   Exit polls yesterday showed overwhelmingly that Buchananvoters backed him for his message -- not his presidentialcredentials. And his heavy expenditures in New Hampshire --about $1.9 million, according to aides -- exhausted much ofthe estimated $2.5 million his campaign has raised.   Young Republican conservatives said the White House mustrespond now by taking a more aggressive approach towardCongress. But Mr. Buchanan's success points up what could bea more lasting problem. Men clearly responded to themuscular, &quot;America first&quot; appeal of the challenger, while theWhite House's efforts to use Congress as its whipping-boyproved less than effective.   At one point yesterday, anxious Bush campaign stafferssent a panicked message to field workers on phone banks tocall only women voters to the polls, and the pronouncedgender gap is expected to lead to tougher tactics by theWhite House in the future.   &quot;We look forward to going South,&quot; said Charles Black, asenior adviser to the president's campaign. He warned thatthe Bush campaign -- which appeared disjointed and uncertainin New Hampshire -- may adopt a harder edge and take on Mr.Buchanan directly in Southern states over the conservativecommentator's opposition to Operation Desert Storm. In hopesof preserving GOP harmony for the fall campaign, &quot;we havefought up there {in New Hampshire} with one hand behind ourback,&quot; Mr. Black said. &quot;If we need to get it over with, wecan handle it differently.&quot;   For Mr. Bush, a continuing challenge from the right wouldsiphon time, money and attention from the campaign's generalelection planning. The nightmare scenario for the Bush-Quaylehigh command is for Mr. Buchanan, fueled by fresh supplies ofcampaign contributions and media attention, to press hisguerrilla attack all the way to the June 2 primary inCalifornia, where the state GOP is badly split betweenmoderate and conservative factions.   But if New Hampshire pointed up the Republicans' problems,it didn't do much to resolve the Democrats'. &quot;It's sort ofthe worst possible situation because it's so unfocused,&quot;fretted Democratic political consultant Greg Schneiders. &quot;Youdon't have a strong candidate coming out of New Hampshire.The question is whether you have a strong candidate comingout of the South.&quot;   The man who gained the most here was Mr. Tsongas. He was asoft-spoken contrast to Mr. Buchanan -- but adopted the samestance as an anti-establishment outsider bent on remaking hisparty. His pro-business platform struck a chord in thiseconomically troubled state, but his social liberalism andelite image could dog him as he competes elsewhere.   Exit polls show Mr. Tsongas did best among wealthier,higher-educated Democratic voters, while his closest rival,Mr. Clinton, was stronger among lower-income working classfamilies. Though Mr. Tsongas served for a decade in Congress,his emergence is still unnerving to many establishedDemocrats: He opposes such cherished party issues as taxbreaks for the middle class and tougher trade sanctions onJapan.   &quot;Some Democrats will find it very hard to take,&quot; Mr.Tsongas said of his pro-business stance at a rally this week.&quot;So be it, so be it.&quot;   Savoring his victory last night, Mr. Tsongas said, &quot;Wewant the economic truth. Tell us the economic truth,Washington, and we can live with it. We are a great nationand we are a great people. The message from New Hampshire istreat us that way.&quot;   Mr. Clinton's campaign stumbled badly here afterdisclosures regarding his private life and efforts to avoidthe draft during the Vietnam War. Among his own generation,the 45-year-old Democrat appears to have been most hamperedbut he has gamely defied those who would have written him outof the race. And he retains enough money to continue hiscampaign into areas such as the South that may prove morehospitable to him.   In the campaign's final days, Mr. Clinton crisscrossed thestate asking voters for a second chance, and his hope is toregain his old edge in the next month. &quot;New Hampshire tonighthas made Bill Clinton the comeback kid,&quot; said Mr. Clintonbefore cheering supporters last night. Mr. Tsongas, the NewEnglander, will be on familiar turf next week in the Mainecaucuses, but his Arkansas rival hopes to recoup on March 3,when Maryland and Georgia go to the polls. Beyond the Southand Super Tuesday March 10, the Clinton campaign has soughtto build a political firewall by organizing heavily inIllinois, which holds its primary March 17.   &quot;I think we've got a Tsongas-Clinton race on our hands,&quot;said Democratic pollster Paul Maslin. &quot;One or the other ofthem is going to have to gain the upper hand in the nextthree weeks. If not, then I think you've got a verycombustible situation.&quot;   Mr. Tsongas has begun to generate some excitement amongGreek-American donors, who pumped millions into MichaelDukakis's ill-starred campaign in 1988 but had been holdingback this time. Still, Mr. Clinton has a huge financialadvantage and has continued to draw financial support evenamid his highly publicized troubles.   The failure of a third Democrat to show any strength todate buys some time for the governor. Sen. Kerrey, whosecampaign is in debt, had hoped to open up some space betweenhimself and his fellow Midwesterner, Sen. Harkin. The SouthDakota primary next week will be a second opportunity, butboth men have had to struggle to connect with voters.   As the two members of Congress in the race, Sens. Harkinand Kerrey paid a price for their association withWashington. Adding to their discomfort last night was thefact that they had to fight for third place with former Gov.Brown, whose grass-roots campaign has played on theanti-establishment mood.   Mr. Kerrey, laying claim to third place, said, &quot;This fighthas just begun.&quot; But despite spending heavily on advertising,he struggled to establish himself as a clear voice. Hissupporters shared his concern for the issue of nationalhealth insurance but this emphasis was outdone by widerconcerns about the economy. Women -- much more than men --backed Mr. Kerrey despite his distinguished war record inVietnam. And though Mr. Kerrey has cast himself as thecandidate of a new generation, Mr. Brown's strength amongbaby-boomer voters between 30 and 44 years old stole supportthat Mr. Kerrey needed.   With most of the Democratic vote in, Mr. Kerrey had 12%,or just one point above Mr. Harkin at 11%. Mr. Brown trailedat 9% and the write-in campaign for Mr. Cuomo finished withonly 4% or slightly above the more low-profile campaignmounted by Mr. Nader's forces.   ---   Staff reporter John Harwood in Washington, D.C.,contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
