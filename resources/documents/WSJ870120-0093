Maybe.   Although financial guarantees are designed to protect investors, it is the issuer who actually buys the insurance and signs the contract with the insurance company or guarantor. Fraud cancels that contract. It isn't clear, however, what obligation the insurer then has to securities holders.    That's a central issue in two Virginia legal disputes involving securities sold by EPIC Mortgage Inc. and Landbank Equity Corp., both of which are no longer operating. In the cases, which are awaiting trial in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, some insurers say their contracts with EPIC and Landbank aren't valid because the two companies used fraud in obtaining the insurance. The insurers maintain that they thus have no obligation to the investors.    But the investors argue that whatever the status of the specific contracts between issuers and the insurers, the insurance companies have an obligation to investors. The reason, the investors say, is that the insurers were so involved in selling the securities that they have a responsibility to investors under securities law.    &quot;If you buy a financial deal on the reliance that an insurance company says it will take a risk above you, that's an underwriter situation,&quot; says Washington lawyer Warren Dennis. Mr. Dennis represents some 60 investors, primarily thrift institutions, in the two cases, which involve mortgages totaling nearly $360 million.    The argument, which an attorney for one of the insurance companies describes as &quot;inventive,&quot; is getting attention from securities executives and lawyers. They say that if insurers are forced to pay investors even when an issuer got the insurance through fraud, rates on some residential and commercial mortgages could rise and returns on insured mortgage securities could decline. Insured municipal and corporate securities could also be affected.    &quot;If you make insurers statutory underwriters, they're going to find a way not to be statutory underwriters or charge for the risk,&quot; says Lewis Ranieri, head of mortgage securities and real estate at Salomon Brothers Inc.    Many insurance companies maintain that they will pay investors even when they believe they have no legal obligation to do so. &quot;How long would we be in business if we welshed?&quot; asks Peter E. Hoey, a senior vice president at Financial Security Assurance.    Financial Security, which guarantees corporate bonds, wasn't involved with EPIC or Landbank. Most of EPIC's insurers have paid, but none of Landbank's has.    EPIC Mortgage is a unit of Equity Programs Investment Corp., which was the real-estate syndicating subsidiary of Community Savings andamp; Loan Association, Bethesda, Md. In 1985, Equity Programs defaulted on more than $1.4 billion of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, triggering a state takeover of the Sandamp;L.    Landbank, a Virginia Beach company, sold millions of dollars of home-equity loans in the secondary market. Many of the loans ended in default, and in September 1985 Landbank filed for bankruptcy liquidation.    According to the investors' suit against the insurers in the EPIC case, some of EPIC's insurers introduced the company to potential investors, acting at least as brokers, if not as underwriters. The suit cites advertisements for one of the insurers, Reliance Group Holdings Inc.'s Commonwealth Mortgage Assurance Co., that promoted the company's skill in the secondary market. &quot;Our aggressive traders,&quot; said one ad, &quot;use their extensive network of contacts to move your money fast.&quot;    A Commonwealth spokesman says that the company's secondary marketing role is simply that of a referral service, and that it is careful not to make any assertions about the quality of the loans involved.    Irving P. Margulies, attorney for Foremost Guaranty Insurance Co., another firm involved in the EPIC investors' suit, calls the investors' argument &quot;very innovative.&quot; He agrees that insurance made the mortgages easier to sell, but he says that's not the point.    &quot;Securities law says you have to participate with the seller,&quot; Mr. Margulies says, &quot;and provision of something useful to the seller doesn't make you a seller.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
