C. Letter.)andM;What has confused everybody to no end is the fact that Bill Gates beganpositioning OS/2 NT as Version 3.0 of OS/2 last fall.andP;  Whether this isintentional mis-positioning or not, it is clear that Microsoft is now just asadept at the venerable practice of FUD Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) as IBMever was in the past.andP;  (It is also very canny mis-positioning in that itprecludes IBM from defining its own OS/2 Version 3.0 without abrogating thecompanies' cross-licensing agreement, at least until Microsoft finallydelivers its software and gives it a more appropriate name.) As I said,forget about OS/2 as a Microsoft product.andP;  It can only confuse the issue.andM;What is true is that Microsoft now believes that DOS and Windows representsubstantially all of its future for mainstream personal computing.andP;  There isa small interim role for OS/2 as a network operating system, but I cover thatissue separately.) So the simplest way to characterize Microsoft's newsystem-software strategy is to say that Microsoft wants Windows everywhere;and that Windows, more than DOS, will come to represent the mainstreamoperating system because it is more visible and because it be extended overtime to add those functions that DOS itself can never inherit because it isstuck in the real-mode, character-based, limited memory architecture of theIntel processor used in the original IBM PC,andM;So the appropriate question to ask is:  Just what does Microsoft believeabout how modern operating systems should be designed?' During the seminar,Bill Gates defined four fundamental objectives for what Microsoft is calling'the next generation&quot; of Windows, which seems to refer more to a Windows 5.0than to the next major release of Windows (and therefore due in 1994 orbeyond).andP;  Those four objectives we: compound documents, an object-orientedfile system, an object-oriented shell, and external macro programming.andP;  (Onelargely accurate way to answer the question would be to say that Microsoftsuspects that Go Corp. has got it mostly right.andP;  Three of the four objectivesthat Gates defined are already properties of Penpoint, with the majorexception being the external macro language.andP;  Microsoft would never say thatpublicly and would never admit that there was any advantage to be gained fromsacrificing compatibility with DOS or Windows.andP;  But the truth is that it willtake Microsoft at least three years and possibly more like five years todeliver the same package of functionality that Go is promising for deliverythis fall.)andM;Almost all of the improvements that Gates and Microsoft are talking about fornext-generation Windows are related to the object-orientation of theoperating system, and they are aU inter-related as a result.andP;  Microsoftclaims that Windows 3.1 will  have&quot; compound documents.andP;  What it will haveinstead, are files that contain data of different types contributed bydifferent programs.andP;  But in a system that is truly object-oriented (if I caneven claim to understand this mumbo jumbo), there is no distinction betweenprograms and data, because every object in the system is made of both logic(programming) and content (data).andP;  In truly elliptical logic, Microsoft issaying that it will give the DOS file system, such as it is, object-orientedextensions that will allow it to manage objects and make Windowsobject-oriented.andP;  The reason that this is elliptical, is that in anobject-oriented operating system, there is no file system.andP;  Or, moreproperly, the file system (i.e.andP;  the system for laying bits down on a storagemedium for later retrieval) is an object itself that interacts with all otherobjects and does not itself manage or keep track of the other objects.andO;Indeed, an object-oriented operating system doesn't really care what kind offile system it interacts with.andP;  This is one reason that Penpoint works sowell on a network with dissimilar systems, since it is not tied to aparticular filing system.andP;  By definition, placing a file system at the centerof an object-oriented operating system means that it is not object-oriented.andO;(I think.andP;  I've got to admit that this stuff makes my head swim.)andM;What Microsoft wants is to have an operating system(s) that does notdistinguish between data and programs, that lets system managers createseamlessly integrated systems of information retrieval and management, thatlets users navigate both personal and corporate data without having to learnhow to program, and that makes the development process more productive andinnovative.andP;  And it wants to get that kind of operating system in areasonably pragmatic fashion that won't leave any of its user or developmentcustomers behind.andP;  So, whether they admire Go Corp. inandM;I was ready to like Object Vision from Borland International, particularlyafter reading the Reviewer's private or not, Microsoft is committed to usingWindows 3.0 and DOS 4.1 as a starting point for an evolutionary path towardthis ideal system.andP;  And Microsoft was very, very clear about how it plans toevolve the system:andM;DOS 5.andP;  0 will be delivered mid year to fix the problems that exist in theunderlying operating system, primarily the fact that different OEMs adopteddifferent versions of DOS and turned what is a simple system into completechaos.andP;  So Microsoft has rewritten DOS to take up as little memory aspossible (the major problem with DOS 4.1) as well as to provide several majorimprovements in the external commands and utilities that come with theproduct.andM;Windows 3.1 (which was demonstrated at the seminar) will feature enhancementsto the existing system: a new file manager, scalable fonts (the muchballyhooed Truetype), and minor adjustments in the user interface, not tomention the extensions embodied in Pen Windows, Multimedia Windows, and OLE.andM;Windows 4.0 (which was not named or demonstrated at the seminar, but wastalked about in terms of evolution of the programming interface) will onlywork with 80386 machines, since it will be a 32-bit system and will containimprovements in the operating system kernel (which is the part of Windowsthat fixes all the problems that DOS has with protected, linear memory), inthe imaging model (primarily in the area of dealing with complex vectorgraphics and with color), and in the ability to network Windows (mostly insupporting named pipes, already in OS/2, and providing support for electronicmessaging).andP;  Microsoft promised to ship the tool kit for this version ofWindows this year, which would imply an end-user release in late 1992.andM;LAN Manager 3.andP;  0 will probably incorporate OS/2 NT (or whatever the heck itwill be called), since the first step that Microsoft's new networkingarchitect talked about in terms of the company's approach to networking (seebelow) was creating a distributed file system on the network itself (whichmeans not having to distinguish between physical disk servers) and that meansthe next major release of LAN Manager is likely to be scheduled for deliveryin mid-to-late 1992.andP;  Once the server file system is taken care of, thecompany can improve the networking features implemented in Windows 4.0 andthen focus on actually making Windows object-oriented so that it can dealwith the network file system seamlessly.andM;Windows 5.0 (which Microsoft was referring to as Advanced Windows) will haveeverything you ever wanted in an operating system: object orientation,distributed file system, visual macro programming for end users, fullyimplemented user-interaction model, built-in network services (userdirectories, mail, filing, etc.), and so forth.andP;  Given what we all know aboutdevelopment schedules, this is probably likely to arrive no sooner than 1994and more likely in 1995.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
