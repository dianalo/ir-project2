Peoples Savings declined to name the institution, but added that an agreement would result in a cash payment for Peoples Savings shareholders. It said the discussions could also result in some &quot;business combination&quot; other than an acquisition.    &quot;The board has decided to retain an experienced financial advisor to assist in the negotiations and to evaluate the fairness of the transaction which may be negotiated,&quot; Marvin N. Schoenhals, president and chief executive officer of Peoples Savings, said in a prepared statement.    The thrift declined to comment further on the announcement.    In August, Peoples Savings signed a consent decree with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in which the thrift agreed to expand its board, stop certain lending practices, and comply with various accounting regulations. Peoples Savings also was forced to restate its earnings from fiscal years 1985 through 1987. The changes lowered the thrift's net worth, or assets minus liabilities, by about $1 million, to $37 million.    Earlier this year, Peoples Savings' president and chief executive officer, and an executive vice president resigned. A Peoples Savings spokesman wouldn't say whether the earlier events were linked to the current merger negotiations.    The announcement was made shortly before the market closed Friday. Peoples Savings stock closed at $17, up $1.25 in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
