This research investigates the claim thatdocument-based information retrieval strategies which automatically extendthe user's query by inferring, through the use of a semantic network,the concepts that the user wishes to retrieve, can out perform traditionalBoolean retrieval strategies. The claim reflects a growing concern amongresearchers and commercial information retrieval services that many relevantdocuments are not being retrieved in systems using Boolean retrievalstrategies. This research compares two classes of document-based informationretrieval strategies-Boolean and concept extended. It analyzes Booleanand concept extended retrieval strategy performance via a stochasticmodel of user querying and information retrieval. Stochastic processesfor querying, retrieving and constructing semantic networks are proposed,and resulting probability distributions are constructed. Results showimproved performance measured by most performance statistics for theconcept extended retrieval strategy over the traditional Boolean strategy.</TEXT></DOC>
