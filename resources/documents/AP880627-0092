In a keynote address to the Canadian-sponsored World Conferenceon the Changing Atmosphere, Dr. Brundtland, a notedenvironmentalist, told more than 300 scientists and politiciansfrom 40 countries:   ``The impact of climatic change may be greater and more drasticthan any other challenges that mankind has faced with the exceptionof the threat of nuclear war.''   She called for a ``new global ethic'' in which protectionagainst air and water pollution, ozone depletion and acid rain is aprerequisite for economic development.   ``We have been playing lethal games with vital life-supportsystems,'' said Brundtland.   Her five-point plan included development of renewable energysources in the next century; the transfer of modern, low-pollutingtechnologies to Third World countries; more research on climaticchange, and consideration of a global convention on protecting theatmosphere.   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney opened the four-dayconference by offering to host a U.N.-run World Conference onSustainable Development in 1992.   By that time, he urged participants, an ``international law ofthe atmosphere'' should be negotiated to limit all types of airpollution.   Those attending include the heads of U.N. environmentalagencies; cabinet ministers from Indonesia, the Netherlands andSenegal; scientists from Harvard University and the Soviet Academyof Sciences, and U.S. Sen. Timothy E. Wirth, D-Colo., and U.S. Rep.George E. Brown, Jr., D-Calif.   Scientists will discuss ozone depletion, acid rain, watermanagement and food prospects, but much interest centers on therecent warming of the earth's surface due to the greenhouse effect,in which gases humans have introduced into the atmosphere preventheat from escaping.   Although experts are not yet ready to ascribe the 1988 droughtto the greenhouse effect, the earth has been warmer in the firstfive months of this year than in any comparable period sincemeasurements began 130 years ago, a NASA climatologist, JamesHansen, told a Congressional hearing in Washington last week.   Five of the warmest years on record have occurred in the 1980sand scientists at Environment Canada predict global temperaturescould rise up to 8 degrees by the year 2050, partially melting thepolar ice caps and raising sea levels three feet.   ``In the last 1,000 years, the climate fluctuated about a halfof a degree. Now we can expect it to go up at 10 times that rate, aphenomenal change unprecedented in human history,'' HenryHengeveld, a climate expert for Environment Canada, told a newsconference.   The problem is manmade. The burning of oil, gas, wood and coalin factories, homes and cars sends the greenhouse gases of carbondioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, ozone and chlorofluorocarbons intothe atmosphere.   For much of the world, there are no alternatives to fossil fuel.In developed countries, public opinion has turned against thecleaner option of nuclear power because of the risk of catastrophicaccidents.   Another major atmospheric problem is the gradual destruction ofthe thin ozone layer, which protects the earth from the sun'sharmful ultraviolet rays. Chlorofluorocarbons used in spray cans,insulation, refrigerators and industrial cleaning tear holes in theozone, and the result has been a marked increase in skin cancer.   Twenty-four nations signed the Montreal Protocol on ozone lastyear, pledging to reduce the use of chlorofluorocarbons by 50percent by 1999.   McDonalds restaurants promised to use something else to insulatetheir take-away packaging and a new type of refrigerator withhelium as a coolant is under development. But global protectionremains a distant goal.   Canada's first atmospheric priority is acid rain. The governmentblames power plant emissions from the U.S. Midwest for at leasthalf the acid rain falling in eastern Canada, which has led to thedestruction of fish life in 14,000 lakes and extensive forestdamage.</TEXT></DOC>
