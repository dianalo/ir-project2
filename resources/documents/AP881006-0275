On the contrary, they're extolling the virtues of Drexel and itsemployees, particularly the financier who largely created thatmarket _ Michael Milken. Some clients go so far as to accusegovernment prosecutors of witch-hunt tactics.   The unabashed defense of Drexel _ even from clients thegovernment claims were cheated _ suggests the 2-year-old crackdownon Wall Street corruption, heralded for bringing speculator IvanBoesky to justice, may now be creating a backlash.   Certainly, the lines of distinction that separated the bad guysfrom the good are becoming blurred. Drexel and Milken, once seen asarrogant, aggressive manipulators behind junk-bond financedtakeover deals, are taking on underdog roles in the wake of thecharges leveled Sept. 7 by the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Moreover, the zealous loyalty Drexel is inspiring suggests mostclients are little concerned with whether the firm or Milken mayhave technically violated securities laws. What counts more is thefirm's extraordinary ability to finance projects from day carecenters to toxic waste cleanups to employee buyouts of bigcompanies.   If results are the principal test of customer satisfaction onWall Street, Drexel passes with flying colors.   ``I have nothing but accolades for those guys,'' said StuartSubotnick, Metromedia Inc. executive vice president, who recruitedDrexel four years ago to help the company refinance by issuing $1.3billion in junk bonds, which at the time was the biggest suchtransaction in history.   ``I must say to you that in 1984, they were head and shouldersabove other firms with respect to their ability, pricing, and inthe end, on execution,'' Subotnick said. ``Everything Drexelpromised to do and then some, they did.''   Subotnick said he was so impressed with Drexel he recentlyrecommended the firm to another large company that wants torefinance.   James McCloskey, vice president for finance at ConcurrentComputer Corp., a New Jersey concern that has merged withMassachusetts Computer Corp. in a Drexel-financed deal, alsoexpressed admiration.   ``The financing was raised, Drexel did perform,'' he said.``That's the ultimate proof of the pudding.''   Some clients are so passionate about their defense of the firmand Milken that they see the legal struggle as the tip of a moreprofound fight, which pits a new breed of entrepreneur against anestablished economic order.   In their view, Milken's visionary talents and financing powerhave aroused the wrath of rivals and Washington policymakers, whosee high-yield bonds as a risky form of debt, and are intent ondestroying the 42-year-old financier.   ``He hasn't yet actually been accused of culpability for theMexican earthquake, or for Hurricane Gilbert, or even for the`greenhouse effect' that as you know threatens terrestrial life aswe know it,'' said Ingersoll Publications Co. chairman RalphIngersoll, a Drexel client and Milken friend.   ``Otherwise there does not seem to be a lot that a frustratedbureaucracy, bent on a Salem-style witch hunt, hasn't attempted toblame on this man.''   Milken, who appeared at a recent publishing conference sponsoredby Ingersoll, declined to talk about the allegations against him orother aspects of the government investigation. But Milken suggestedhe's been treated harshly and his work is widely misunderstood.   ``I think we probably haven't done a good job explaining,'' hesaid. ``But you know, sometimes something's a two-way street. Youhave to care, to want to understand, too.''   The high-yield bonds Milken is credited with developing are debtsecurities that pay high interest, often issued by companies thatcannot get investment-grade status from major credit-ratingagencies.   Pilloried by critics as a weapon for funding hostile takeovers,the high-yield bond market has emerged as an important source ofalternative long-term financing for hundreds of small andmedium-sized companies.   For its part, Drexel has attempted to shed the image as a primepurveyor of high-yield bonds for hostile takeovers, and nowpromotes the idea that such securities serve more useful andproductive purposes.   A blitz of Drexel advertisements suggest its high-yield bondsfinance only the most morally upright enterprises, such asKinder-Care Inc., a network of day-care and pre-school learningcenters; Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., a housing developer; andUnimar International Inc., a shipbuilder purchased by employees.   The cover of Drexel's high-yield bond unit 1988 annual report isan artist's rendition of typical smalltown U.S.A, replete with ahospital, shopping mall and school, built on a rolled-out carpet ofhigh-yield bonds.   For almost two years, Drexel and Milken have been under intensescrutiny by the SEC and Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, theresult of a deal struck with Boesky, a convicted insider trader, toturn state's evidence and identify others in his illegal acts.   Last month, the SEC finally accused Drexel, Milken and threeother employees of secretly scheming with Boesky to violate a rangeof securities laws that centered on some of the biggest takeoverdeals of the decade.   But the charges seemed based mostly on Boesky's claims and fellfar short of speculation that dozens of Drexel employees would beimplicated.   The U.S. attorney's office has yet to bring any charges, andthere is talk that the grand jury investigation it is directing hasbeen delayed. There also have been other indications thatinvestigators have found it difficult to obtain conclusive evidenceto support Boesky's revelations.   Even before the SEC filed its charges, investigators had comeunder attack from Drexel and its supporters for leaking sensitivedetails of the probes to pressure the brokerage into settlementtalks. Officials denied those allegations and continue tocharacterize their pursuit of Wall Street wrongdoers as animportant part of the campaign against white-collar crime.   Perhaps the most serious of the SEC's charges against Drexel arethat it cheated two important clients, Maxxam Group Inc. and WickesCos., in the midst of prominent takeover deals a few years ago.   But if Maxxam and Wickes believe they were victimized theyhaven't said so or moved to sue Drexel on their own.   Instead, Wickes issued a statement supporting Drexel, which ishelping Wickes' management finance an acquisition of the company.Wickes said the SEC action would have no impact on that transaction.   Other Drexel clients in the midst of deals also have come to itsdefense.   Ernest Bates, president, chairman and chief executive ofAmerican Shared Hospital Services in San Francisco, said heexpected no adverse impact on his company's proposed publicoffering of stocks and debt securities.   ``We continue to have the highest confidence in Drexel,'' hesaid. ``We trust the current litigation will be resolved promptlyand that these key financing mechanisms will continue to be widelyavailable in the marketplace.''  </TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Monday Oct. 10</NOTE></DOC>
