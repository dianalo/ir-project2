Brock Jr.,andO;director of the GAO's government information and financial managementdivision, pointed out that since the alleged release of a virus on thenetwork last year by Cornell University graduate student Robert Morris,Internet &quot;security has been improved.&quot; Internet is the major United Statesresearch and development computer network linking government, industry, anduniversities.andP;  Of greatest concern has been the fact that the Department ofDefense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) ARPAnet is a partof this system.andP;  Special steps were recently taken to plug the holes in theUnix operating system which authorities say allowed the Morris virus topenetrate the system last November 2.andP;  On Thursday the committee heardtestimony from ADAPSO, the Association of Data Processing ServiceOrganization, on the threat of computer virus software.andP;  Testifying was JohnLandry, executive vice president of Cullinet Software and ADAPSO's VirusCommittee chairman, who emphasized that virus attacks shouldn't be takenlightly since they can have life-threatening consequences if they were toinfect a hospital's system, a nuclear plant's control systems, or perhaps anair traffic control system.andP;  Landry was speaking in support of tougher lawsrelating to computer vandalism and specifically called for confiscation ofhardware and software involved in any attack.andP;  While this might be a minorproblem for a home hacker, someone utilizing a corporate, government, oruniversity computer system could potentially involve his organization inmassive liabilities, depending on just how such a law would be structured.andO;Representative Edward Markey, Democrat from Massachusetts, a major U.S.andO;technological center, is the chairman of the House Committee investigatingvirus attacks and other aspects of computer security.andP;  Title 18, Section1030, of the U.S.andP;  Criminal Code is presently used to prosecute thoseattacking computer systems, but the law is vague about what constitutesunauthorized access and there is still a big question about possiblepenalties.andP;  In a dramatic move, Rep.andP;  Markey announced his plan to introducenew legislation covering the entire field of computer crime.andP;  The new billwould be a combination of HR-55, (HR stands for House of Representatives anddesignates a bill pending before the House) directed at computer viruses, andHR-287, which covers both hardware and software sabotage.andP;  A virus (or worm)is a piece of computer code that is designed to insinuate itself into anycomputer system it can reach, replicating itself until the system is filledwith the virus and can no longer function.andP;  Some so-called &quot;mild&quot; virusattacks are just intended to bring attention to themselves rather thanactually damage a system, but even these can have unexpected results.andP;  It isthought that the virus released onto Internet last year, allegedly by 23-yearold Cornell computer student Robert Morris, Jr.andP;  (son of an importantcomputer scientist at the super-secret U.S.andP;  National Security Agency) wasnot intended to spread as far and cause as much damage as it did.andP;  The viruseventually shut down more than 6,000 computers from November 2 to 3, 1988, atan estimated cost of over $200 million.andP;  ADAPSO is working with otherindustry groups to strengthen laws covering &quot;electronic vandalism.&quot; (JohnMcCormick/19890721/Press Contact: Frances Ianacone, ADAPSO, 703-522-5055, orRep.andP;  Edward J.
