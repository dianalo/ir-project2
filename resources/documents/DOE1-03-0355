It is shown that supersonic, subsonic, and mixed flows containingshock waves can occur in the channel of an MHD generator, which leadto substantially nonlinear voltage-current and load characteristics.Nonlinear effects give rise to optimum values for the induction and loadresistance, which provide maximum power or voltage. Cyclic variationin field or load resistance results in hysteresis. The characteristictimes have been determined for typical transients.</TEXT></DOC>
