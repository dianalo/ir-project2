Slater-Koster fits to self-consistent,scalar-relativistic, augmented-plane-wave band calculations have beenemployed and scaling relations were used in determining gradients ofthe tight-binding matrix elements. The two-center integral parameterswere adjusted for alloys in a way which explicitly accounts for the changein lattice constant. Results for 3d and 4d transition-metal elementsare in good agreement with rigid-muffin-tin calculations. In addition,the electron-phonon coupling in Mo/sub x/Nb/sub 1-//sub x/ is evaluatedfrom densities of states calculated by the coherent-potential approximation.The measured variation of the superconducting transition temperatureas a function of x is reproduced well by this calculation.</TEXT></DOC>
