The pact calls for Constellation Holdings to invest $41 million in the plants. Another $41 million will be invested by the other joint venturers. And the balance of the $218 million will be raised by borrowing against the value of the facilities themselves.    Constellation's joint venturers are Ultrasystems, which owns 50% of each of two projects and 40% of two others, and Combustion Engineering Inc., which owns 10% of each of two of the projects.    Ultrasystems is an Irvine, Calif.-based engineering and power development company, which started the projects. Constellation Holdings is a diversified unit of Baltimore Gandamp;E, with interests in financial investments, real estate and alternative energy projects. Combustion Engineering, a maker of industrial equipment based in Stamford, Conn., previously held a 50% interest in all four projects. </TEXT></DOC>
