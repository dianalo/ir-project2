But the effect was similar, for the sudden darkness illuminated the central dilemma facing the conference participants, and all of Africa today: how to shield the struggling economies of southern Africa from the consequences of the international sanctions drive against South Africa.    &quot;Everywhere in Africa, in our sleep and in our waking hours, we are constantly thinking of this,&quot; says Dzingai Mutumbuka, Zimbabwe's minister of education.    In the past, no amount of thinking has been able to devise a way of weaning southern Africa from its almost total reliance on South Africa. Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Mozambique, Angola, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho and Malawi -- which are on the front line of the anti-apartheid battle -- depend on South Africa to supply much of their energy needs and to move between 50% and 100% of their foreign trade.    As fears of border closures and other countersanctions grow, the front-line states are groping for ways to loosen South Africa's stranglehold on their economies. But their dream of creating a regional common market that could act as a counterweight to Pretoria's dominance is running up against the harsh reality of civil strife that is scaring off Western financial assistance and investment.    Simba Makoni, the executive secretary of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference, estimates the costs of South African destabilization in the region at $10 billion over the past five years. Much of this stems from the guerrilla fighting in Angola and Mozambique (the South Africans have supported rebel forces in both countries), which has sapped money and manpower and has knocked out several important transport routes that had been used as alternatives to going through South Africa.    Moreover, even as they strive to become more self-reliant, the front-line states are finding that their dependence on South Africa is actually increasing. The most graphic illustration of this dilemma is in Zimbabwe, where Robert Mugabe's government has had to tone down its calls for international pressure on Pretoria.    Mr. Mugabe vowed that he would impose sanctions of his own by the end of last year, but he has had to postpone his plans while he prepares his country for possible countersanctions. Even more embarrassing is the recent confirmation by South African officials that Pretoria has delivered 34,000 tons of fuel to Zimbabwe to relieve a shortage caused by supply disruptions from a Mozambique pipeline.    &quot;A situation where nine states are as dependent on one country as they are today isn't acceptable,&quot; says Mr. Makoni.    His group has devised about 400 development projects, with top priority assigned to rehabilitating alternative trade and communications routes that circumvent South Africa. Industrial and agricultural production policies are being coordinated in an effort to turn the region into a larger, more self-sufficient market. And efforts are being made to use the region's vast resources of precious minerals to attract the investments of multinational corporations.    &quot;As far as minerals go, you name it and we got it,&quot; says Brownson N. Dede, a top official at the Organization of African Unity. &quot;What we're trying to tell the Americans is that they have to be there at the start of things, because it will be a lot harder to get in on the action later.&quot;    American companies are also being urged to get involved in the southern African countries by the disinvestment forces. Until now, this lobby has pressured U.S. and European companies with a single demand: complete withdrawal from South Africa. Now, another demand is being added: Relocate in the neighboring states. Thus, the praise that greeted Eastman Kodak Co.'s announcement last year that it was shutting down its South African operations entirely and removing all products from the market is now turning into criticism for not establishing operations elsewhere in the region.    &quot;The American people are feeling good about sanctions and disinvestment and they are asking, 'What now?'&quot; one of the leaders of the U.S. anti-apartheid movement told the African-American conference. &quot;Now, we have to make the linkage to the front-line states.&quot;    But until the security problems in the region are resolved, governments and corporations will be hesistant to make big investments. Already, U.S. plans to give $100 million in annual aid to southern Africa have been considerably reduced, and separate initiatives by European countries have also been scaled back.    &quot;How can you convince a government to give money for the reconstruction of a transport route when it will probably only be blown up again in the fighting?&quot; asks a U.S. representative at the conference here. &quot;If you don't get these security issues straightened out, you can't straighten out the economies.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
