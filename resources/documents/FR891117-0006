This program is intended to be a logical extensionof the Customs expanded interdiction program, and is to exist for a 2-yeartest period. This interim amendment establishes the ACSPP for a 2-yearperiod at the Miami, Dallas, and Los Angeles International Airports. Participationin the program will be optional for carriers. In order to be consideredfor the program, a carrier will have to provide Customs with a comprehensivesecurity plan to assist in preventing illicit drugs from entering the UnitedStates. Those carriers which do apply and are accepted will be accordedthe appropriate consideration should any contraband violation occur. TheACSPP is intended to increase the cooperative effort which prevails betweenCustoms and the carriers.

As a result of increased penalties and possible seizureof conveyances with the enactment of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Customsand many of the major carriers have been working closely together withother law enforcement agencies to combat the flow of illegal drugs. Thusfar, cooperation with air carriers has been reflected by the creation ofinitiatives on three levels which describe the relationships between Customsand the air carriers. At the lowest level, there is no official agreementbetween Customs and the carriers. This level consists of primarily low-riskflights or carriers. The feeling between the parties is that, at present,compliance with existing regulations offers adequate protection for thecarriers and provides sufficient safeguards to Customs and the Americanpeople.A second level of the air carrier initiative consists of formal agreementsbetween the air carriers and Customs. At this level, the carriers are engagedin flights on which there is a higher risk that attempts will be made tosmuggle illegal narcotics. At this level, the air carriers have agreedwith Customs that they will take active measures to prevent their conveyancesfrom being used to facilitate smuggling. To this end, they and Customshave developed procedures which are intended to reduce the chances thatnarcotics will be on or in planes operated by the carrier.On May 1, 1989, Customs announced a new ``Super Carrier Initiative Agreement''with the aim of further uniting government and industry efforts to eliminatecommercial carriers as the means of transporting narcotics into the UnitedStates. This program was designed to meet the needs of high risk carriersthat have made significant efforts to prevent smuggling aboard their conveyancesbut continue to experience difficulties resulting in mounting penaltiesand seizures of their conveyances. By signing the Super Carrier InitiativeAgreement, the carrier agrees to impose strict security standards at foreignand domestic terminals and facilities and aboard their conveyances. Inreturn, Customs will provide enhanced security awareness training, foreignand domestic site surveys, and assistance in identifying potential smugglingopportunities. Should illegal drugs continue to be found aboard the conveyance,the degree of compliance with the terms of the agreement will be consideredin assessing penalties or seizing the conveyance.<ITAG tagnum="84">Air Carrier Smuggling Prevention Program</ITAG>In section 7369 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 1584 note),Congress sought to reinforce the cooperative efforts of Customs and theair carriers by directing the Customs Service to establish a 2-year demonstrationprogram at three international airports classified as high risk. This programhas been identified as the Air Carrier Smuggling Prevention Program (ACSPP).The 2-year demonstration of the ACSPP will be conducted at the Miami, Dallas,and Los Angeles International Airports. These sites vary in size, airportconfiguration, and geographic proximity to narcotic source countries, aswell as in level of risk, and will provide an adequate assessment of thisprogram. To expedite this program, Customs is willing to work with carriersand accept applications to enter into this program prior to the effectivedate of this interim regulation.As an integral element in the ACSPP, the carrier must continue to stressthe importance of its security measures at the point of departure. It mustbe understood that the ACSPP is designed to prevent drugs from enteringthe United States by instituting preventive procedures at the point ofdeparture.Carriers who wish to participate in the program will have to submit detailedcompliance programs (Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)) to Customs forreview and approval prior to their being accepted into the program. TheseSOPs will have to detail security procedures the carriers will take toreduce the possibility of their aircraft being used by smugglers. Theseprocedures will have to include employee awareness programs, passengerbaggage and cargo integrity procedures, as well as physical security measureswhich will have to be taken at both foreign and domestic terminals. Thesemeasures will not affect any Customs right to conduct searches or inspectionsof passengers, cargo and conveyances. The interim amendment to part 122of the Customs Regulations sets forth the establishment of the ACSPP, andthe criteria and methods which Customs will utilize in determining an aircarrier's eligibility to participate in the program. The interim regulationis being issued after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Before adopting this interim amendment as a final rule, consideration willbe given to any written comments timely submitted to Customs. Commentssubmitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with theFreedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), andSection; 1.4, Treasury DepartmentRegulations (31 CFR 1.4), and andSection; 103.11(b), Customs Regulations(19 CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days between the hours of 9:00a.m. and 4:30 p.m., at the Regulations and Disclosure Law Branch, Room2119, U.S. Customs Service Headquarters, 1301 Constitution Avenue, NW.,Washington, DC.<ITAG tagnum="84">Inapplicability of Notice</ITAG>Congress directed that the ACSPP be established within 6 months after enactmentof the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
