The United States has formally renounced possession of anybiological weapons or their use but the administration says itstill needs a ``defensive research'' program to develop and testprotection for American troops.   ``We certainly have the responsibility to the soldier to protecthim and her against those who would use biological weapons,''Thomas J. Welch, deputy assistant secretary of defense, told threeHouse subcommittees.   Lynn Hansen, assistant director of the Arms Control andDisarmament Agency, said the Soviets have ``an active researchprogram'' in sciences that could be used for building germ weapons.   The Soviets have ``continued to maintain an offensive biologicalwarfare program,'' Hansen warned.   The Army wants to build a $5.4 million biological testlaboratory at Utah's Dugway Proving Ground. The plan has beentemporarily shelved because of strong local opposition, but Welchsaid the request will be made again next year.   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, who represents the area, said the Armyplans have been ``setting off alarm bells throughout the scientificcommunity, both internationally and in Utah, as to the publicsafety and wisdom of building the Dugway facility.''   The Army wants the lab to be to ``bio-safety level four (B-4),''the highest standard of protection. However, all the plannedexperiments could be done in a B-3 lab, said Welch, who explainedthe higher safety level would be an additional public protection.   Owens noted the lab would have the capability ``to convert theselethal pathogens into aerosol form'' and that potential was thechief cause of public fears.   The United States officially closed down its biological weaponsprogram, which was headquartered at Fort Detrick, Md., in 1969 andannounced that future research would be limited to ``defensive''purposes. The United States is also a party to a 1972 treatybanning biological weapons, but the pact lacks enforcement orverification provisions.   Welch, Hansen and other officials said repeatedly Tuesday thatthe Army's research program was only defensive and the UnitedStates would not use germ weapons and wouldn't violate the 1972pact.   Welch said: ``It would be impossible for us to use biologicalweapons because we don't have them. ... We would never usebiological weapons against anybody.''   But Owens said, ``the line between defensive and offensiveresearch would be so hopelessly blurred by the construction of alevel-four aerosol facility that the Dugway lab could easilyperceived by other nations as a provocative violation'' of thetreaty.   Other legislators also appeared skeptical. Rep. Dante Fascell,D-Fla., said ``the line between offensive and defensive biologicalagents seems fuzzy at best.''   Under questioning, Army Col. Walter Busby, who oversees thetesting program, said there are ``no plans to use geneticallyengineered material'' at Dugway.   Some of the biological agents tested at Dugway are shippedthrough regular mails, officials said.   Jeremy Rifkin, a chief critic of the new lab, said anenvironmental impact statement on the lab released by the Army inFebruary dismisses a number of potential problems, including fire,terrorism, sabotage or explosion.   He criticized the statement as ``shoddily prepared, grosslyinadequate.''   Rifkin is president of the private Foundation on EconomicTrends, which has sued to block construction of the Army lab.   The witnesses testified at a joint hearing of the House ForeignAffairs arms control subcommittee, the Interior subcommittee onenergy and the environment, and the Armed Services subcommittee onmilitary installations and facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
