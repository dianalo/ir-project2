The seven-count indictment, which carries charges ofperjury and making false statements, alleges that Mr.Clarridge sought to conceal the Reagan administration's rolein a secret arms shipment to Iran in November 1985 andrepeatedly lied as to when he learned of the nature of thecargo.</LP><TEXT>   The shipment, carrying U.S. Hawk anti-aircraft missiles,relied on Israeli middlemen. But a CIA proprietary airlinewas tapped to carry the weapons, and officers in Europehelped expedite the flight. Mr. Clarridge was a close ally tothen-National Security Council aide, Lt. Col. Oliver North,and as chief of the CIA's European division, he played adirect role in carrying out these arrangements on behalf ofhis friend and the White House.   The shipment laid the groundwork for much of what followedin the Iran-Contra affair as the Reagan administration soondirectly involved itself in the sale of arms to Iran and thediversion of profits to fund anti-Sandinista forces inNicaragua. When the scandal broke in late 1986, the November1985 shipment came back to haunt high government officials.And the charges now reflect a continued effort by independentcounsel Lawrence Walsh to show that CIA officers were used inan attempted coverup.   William McDaniel, Mr. Clarridge's attorney, said hisclient would be proven innocent. But court papers filed bythe prosecution reflect grand jury testimony contradictingthe former officer and giving new details as to his contactswith Col. North leading up to the shipment. Chief among theseis a Nov. 19, 1985, meeting between Col. North, Mr. Clarridgeand Vincent Cannistraro, a second CIA officer, at a Virginiarestaurant and lounge that became a favorite watering holefor Col. North's network of operatives.   &quot;During this meeting, Lt. Col. North discussed with thedefendant . . . and Mr. Cannistraro the trouble that Lt. Col.North was having obtaining flight clearances in Europe for anaircraft that would be traveling to Iran,&quot; according to theindictment. &quot;Lt. Col. North stated at the time that the cargowould be military equipment.&quot;   Both Col. North and Mr. Cannistraro have appeared beforethe grand jury that brought yesterday's indictment, and thepapers contradict Mr. Clarridge's claim that he didn't knowweapons were involved before the flight was under way five tosix days later. When he testified before the SenateIntelligence Committee, for example, Mr. Clarridge said hebelieved at the time that the cargo was oil-drillingequipment -- a cover story used in the operation -- and heportrayed the transaction as a &quot;straight commercial deal&quot;with no major government involvement.   Though the charges focus on his involvement with armssales to Iran, Mr. Clarridge's relationship with Col. Northwas far broader and included a shared commitment to theContras, or Nicaraguan insurgents who ultimately benefitedfrom the profits generated by the shipments. Mr. Clarridgeheaded the CIA's Latin America division in the early 1980sand, on occasion, traveled in the region under the code name&quot;Mr. Maroni.&quot; While other CIA officers have been described asdisdainful of Congress, his temperament was outwardlydefiant, and his aggressive tenure is best remembered for thesecret mining of Nicaraguan harbors in 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
