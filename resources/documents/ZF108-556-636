(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Winn RoschandM;Rewritable optical disks are not necessarily the best for every storageapplication, but they are a safe, secure means of  storing hundreds ofmegabytes.andM;Such disks cannot compare with Winchester hard disks for speed or cost -- they're only about one-quarter to one-half  the speed of a  quick Winchester and, with prices  starting at $3,500, can cost twice as  much.andP;  However, they offer their  own benefits.andM;Rewritable optical disks are  packed in removable cartridges, giving a singledrive almost unlimited storage.andP;  Cartridges are  compact enough to be carriedseveral in a  briefcase or locked in a safe.andM;Unlike Winchester drives, floppy disks  and even nine-track tapes, rewritableoptical disks are virtually free from self-erasure, making data stored onthem more  long-lived than on traditional media.andP;  And  they resist the perilsthat plague traditional magnetic media, including stray magnetic fields andhead crashes.andM;But the best part about today's rewritable optical disks may be that, in someways, they are not so different from the  Winchesters that people have grownto  accept.andP;  &quot;Magneto-optical,&quot; the name of the  technology used for currentrewritable optical drives, hints at the underlying similarity to hard disksand floppies.andM;&quot;Magneto-optical is the most developed  and successful rewritable opticaltechnology,&quot; said Richard Gardner, vice president  of Alphatronix Inc. inResearch Triangle  Park, N.C., and a pioneer in the rewritable  opticaltechnology begun at 3M in the early 1980s.andM;&quot;Many people think of it as an optical- storage technology, when in realityit is a  magnetic technology,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Information is stored as zeros andones on a magnetic thin film, just as on Winchester  disks.&quot;andM;The real difference between traditional  magnetic media and rewritableoptical is  simply that the new drives replace the  magnetic read-write headwith an optical  system.andM;&quot;Magneto-optical technology is optically  assisted magnetic storage,&quot; saidGardner.andP;  &quot;During the read process, you read it with  optical lasers.&quot;andM;The magnetic fields on the disk shift the  alignment of polarized light, andthat shift  can be detected to read the magnetically  stored data.andM;&quot;You are shining a beam of polarized  light on the disk surface, and theplane of  polarization [of the laser] rotates with regard to the magneticfield,&quot; said Gardner.andM;The advantage of using a laser to read  the disk is that its beam can betightly focused.andP;  While the magnetic domains  (groups of magnetic particles)used for storing data remain the same size for both  Winchester andrewritable optical disks,  the optical systems allow the data to be moredensely packed.andM;&quot;The density in the track in more advanced Winchesters is the same as inoptical recording,&quot; said Chris Steenbergen,  manager of technical and systemssupport  at Philips and Du Pont Optical Co., of Wilmington, Del., a maker ofrewritable optical media.andP;  &quot;The main advantage of optical is that they canpack those tracks really  close together.&quot;andM;Another benefit of using optics to read  the disk is that the read/write headdoes  not have to be kept close to the disk.andP;  In  contrast with the heads inWinchester  drives, the optical head never touches the  disk surface, evenwhen a drive is shut off.andP;  Consequently, head crashes are virtually impossible.andM;The magnetic material used in rewritable optical drives differs from that ina  Winchester because it is more resistant to  changes in magnetic polarity.andM;&quot;The resistance to rotating fields in a  normal magnetic material may be 600oersteds,&quot; said Gardner.andP;  &quot;In the case of a magneto-optical material, it maybe more than  an order of magnitude greater.&quot;andM;In other words, stray fields and self- erasure won't affect rewritableoptical  disks.andP;  This also makes the medium particularly hard to write dataon.andM;&quot;Put a refrigerator magnet on a floppy  disk and the information disappears,&quot;said  Gardner.andP;  &quot;But that's not the case with  rewritable optical.andP;  The diskneeds to be warmed up before you can write it.&quot;andM;The heat (120 degrees Celsius, or 250  degrees Fahrenheit) needed to changethe  field is provided automatically by the  same laser used for reading thedata, but  with its power increased.andM;As the laser heats the magnetic thin  film, the media's resistance to changeis  diminished, and its magnetic state can  then be altered by a fieldgenerated by a  magnetic head that's paired with the laser.andM;Magneto-optical is not the only rewritable optical technology that has beendeveloped by vendors.andP;  Several companies  are developing phase-change anddiploymer rewritable optical systems.andP;  For example, the widely publicizedreusable compact-disk system from Tandy Corp. is  based on dipolymertechnology.andM;However, magneto-optical technology  has proved more advantageous than the other technologies, even beyond its familiar magnetic basis.andM;&quot;With magneto-optical media, problems  associated with other technologies donot  exist,&quot; said Gardner.andM;&quot;Just as, with any other magnetic device, you can cycle MO millions oftimes.&quot;andM;Neither phase-change nor dipolymer  media can withstand anywhere near that number of write cycles.andP;  Both alternative  technologies rely on physicalchanges in the media; phase-change processes, for example, change the crystalstructure or  bonding of the medium.andM;Such physical changes stress the medium and result in fatigue, much like the metal fatigue suffered by airliners.andP;  After a  few thousand cycles, thematerial may  lose characteristics essential for the recording of data.andP;  Afew thousand cycles  may sound sufficient for use in computer- disk storage,but it falls far short of actual  requirements.andM;&quot;You may not erase your entire disk  very often, but its directory is erasedand  updated millions of times as you use it,&quot;  said Gardner.andP;  &quot;The couple ofbands associated with your directory undergo tremendous cycling.&quot;andM;While phase-change and dipolymer media may be suitable for some specialized applications that require a limited number of write cycles, onlymagneto-optical  systems currently couple safe and secure  storage withalmost unlimited writing  abilities.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
