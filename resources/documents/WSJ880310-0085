When, in September 1983, the U.S. Senate debated the War Powers Act and its applicability to Mr. Reagan's deployment of U.S. Marines in Lebanon, Sen. Barry Goldwater, defending the President's power to dispatch troops without congressional permission, was reduced to the ignominy of citing Dean Acheson, Harry Truman, and Franklin Roosevelt as authorities for his view that &quot;once the military forces are established and equipped, it is for the President alone to decide how to deploy and use those forces.&quot; Sen. Goldwater, in the later parts of his career, never tired of excoriating the Rev. Jerry Falwell, Sen. Jesse Helms, and kindred souls among his colleagues in the Senate, and other figures of the &quot;New Right&quot; for their alleged deviations from conservative orthodoxy as defined by himself, although in the principal statement of that orthodoxy in 1960 he lamented that &quot;The Achesons and {Arthur} Larsons have had their way. . . . Inside the federal government both the executive and judicial branches have roamed far outside their constitutional boundary lines,&quot; and he had correctly pointed out the intentions of the Framers in &quot;dispersing public authority among several levels and branches of government in the hope that each seat of authority, jealous of its own prerogatives, would have a natural incentive to resist aggression by others.&quot; As late as 1978, Sen. Goldwater's name appeared as the author of a learned study published by The Heritage Foundation that argued against the legality of President Carter's claim to the right of abrogating the Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China. </TEXT></DOC>
