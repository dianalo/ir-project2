The reorganization plan envisions no further layoffs or plantclosings, although it includes restructuring the company aroundexisting business units.   Chairman Raymond Hay said LTV's principal components will be adown-sized steel company concentrating on flat-rolled products, twoaerospace and defense operating groups and a streamlined energyproducts division.   The plan, approved by LTV's board of directors, will besubmitted to creditors for consideration, Hay said. U.S. BankruptcyJudge Burton Lifland, who had given the company a May 20 deadlinefor the proposal, must also agree on the proposal.   ``It has been our commitment from the beginning to emerge fromChapter 11 as quickly as possible with a strong, reorganizedcompany that will be competitive in each of the industries weserve,'' Hay said.   LTV sought protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 offederal bankruptcy laws in July 1986, one of the largest filings incorporate history. Liabilities total about $6 billion and include a$2 billion claim by the government-run Pension Benefit GuarantyCorp. _ LTV's largest creditor.   The reorganization hinges on three LTV Steel pension plans,terminated by the PBGC in early 1987. The agency took over theplans but then turned them back to LTV, arguing that the companyshould fund them.   The dispute is now in a New York court, but Hay said the companyis confident it will prevail.   ``It is our contention that LTV Steel did not have the abilityto fund these pension plans when they were terminated, and it doesnot have the ability now,'' he said.   ``The cost associated with them was one of the major factorsthat put us into Chapter 11,'' Hay said. ``And the reduction ofcosts resulting from their termination is crucial to the company'ssuccessful reorganization.''   Hay said he expected the company, which employs 48,115 workersworldwide, to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings some time nextyear.   ``The thing that delayed our ability to come out as soon as wehad hoped to was the issue with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.And that has pretty much slowed everything down,'' he said.   Sources told the Dallas Times Herald the reorganization plan islikely to be revised during court negotiations, and that it couldoffer creditors no more than 30 cents on the dollar, mainly as anequity stake in the company.   Hay said several years of weakness in LTV's steel and energybusinesses, along with operating and liquidity problems thatdeveloped in mid-1986, caused the company to seek bankruptcyprotection.   But, he said, the company's steel operations were more efficientthan two years ago, aerospace and defense sectors were restructuredto ``sharpen the focus of on our principal lines of business'' andenergy operations were scaled down.   Bill Deatherage, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. inNew York, predicted LTV will succeed.   ``If you have a company with a substantial amount of revenuesrelated to aircraft, with fewer and fewer new military programscoming on line, then these guys will have to redirect their futuresomewhere,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
