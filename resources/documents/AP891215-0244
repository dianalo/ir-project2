Also denying bribery charges were Toshiro Ono, an executive ofRecruit, an information conglomerate, and two politicians: TakaoFujinami, a former Cabinet minister, and Katsuya Ikeda of theopposition Komeito (Clean Government) party.   If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to five years inprison.   Their trial is the last of five, which began Nov. 22 in TokyoDistrict Court and will last for months as the legal system delvesinto allegations of corruption in in the cozy relationship betweenJapanese government and business.   The Recruit scandal began in summer 1988 and brought down PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita, who resigned last spring afteracknowledging he received large donations from Recruit.   Other key figures in the governing Liberal Democratic Party havebeen sidelined by the scandal and the honesty of rankingbureaucrats has been questioned because of gifts they accepted fromRecruit.   Ezoe, 53, told Judge Tadatsugu Watanabe today he accepted theprosecution's allegations that he provided gifts and bargain-pricedshares of stock to influential figures. But he said they weren'tintended as bribes.   ``These events did occur, but I do not agree with the substanceof the charges,'' Ezoe said. ``I had absolutely no intention ofcommitting bribery. ... I apologize for causing social disorder.''   Like the other three defendants, Ezoe accused prosecutors ofmistreating him.   ``The prosecutors questioned me from morning to night. When Itried to close my eyes they forced me to keep them open to thepoint that they hurt so bad that tears were flowing,'' he said.   Fujinami, 56, was chief Cabinet secretary under Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone, Takeshita's predecessor. He is accused ofreceiving the equivalent of $140,000 and 10,000 shares inRecruit-Cosmos, a subsidiary whose stock was offered to influentialpeople at a reduced price before it was sold publicly.   Prosecutors say he put pressure on the Labor Ministry not tochange the traditional season for recruiting college graduates,which would have hurt Recruit's sales of job-placement magazines.Fujinami denied the allegations.   Fujinami said he had been unaware of both the politicaldonations from Recruit and the share-dealing, which was done by anaide.   Ikeda, 52, is charged with receiving $14,000 for himself,$35,000 for his wife and 5,000 shares in Recruit-Cosmos for hisbrother.   According to prosecutors, he gave pro-Recruit speeches inParliament in return. Ikeda resigned his seat; Fujinami remained inParliament, but resigned from his party.   Ono, a 39-year-old former company department head who faces twocounts of giving bribes, denied the allegation.   The other trials involve six bureaucrats and two other Recruitexecutives.   Prosecutors must show the point at which a gift becomes a bribe.Japanese law says bribery occurs when a public official orpolitician receives money or valuables from people or companies theofficial is in a position to supervise.   Recruit offered millions of discount shares in Recruit-Cosmos tohundreds of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen before thestock was available to the general public.   When it was offered on the over-the-counter market, the price ofthe stock shot up and the insiders made large profits. Fujinami'sshares were said to have gained him $215,000.   On Wednesday, the former chairman of Nippon Telegraph andTelephone Corp., Hisashi Shinto, 79, acknowledged he made about$145,000 in 1986 on Recruit-Cosmos shares he bought before theissue went public, but denied favoring Recruit with specialtreatment when it entered the telecommunications market.   ``I accepted the offer of shares, but I never regarded it as abribe,'' he said. ``Rejecting such an offer is considered rude inJapan.''   Defense lawyers have argued such favors were normal betweenbusinesses and the powerful bureaucracy in Japan, where an entireindustry has evolved around the custom of exchanging gifts tocement personal and business ties.   Businessmen say such gifts are not aimed at winning specificfavors but at establishing relationships with business associates,supervising agencies and politicians that make it easier to dobusiness with them.</TEXT></DOC>
