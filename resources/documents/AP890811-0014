Here's a tongue-in-cheek glossary of some of the phrases thatwill soon be on every bureaucrat's lips, as well as those that _mercifully _ will fade into history:   _SAIF, a reassuring acronym pronounced ``safe,'' as in ``Yourmoney is safe if it's insured by SAIF.'' It stands for SavingsAssociation Insurance Fund, an organization once called FSLIC(pronounced fizz-lick). Unfortunately, FSLIC fizzled, creating thecrisis that led to the bailout.   _OTS (pronounced oats) is the Office of Thrift Supervision. Itwas once called FHLBB, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (pronouncedflub). Usage: FHLBB flubbed its job, so it was folded into theTreasury Department and renamed OTS.   Under a preliminary version of the bill, OTS would have beencalled COSA (pronounced coh-sa _ Chairman of the Office of SavingsAssociations). But that was dropped, perhaps because it stirredunpleasant memories of allegations that FHLBB was too cozy with theindustry it regulated.   _BIF (pronounced like the sound created when Batman or Robinslugs a crooked thrift executive) is the Bank Insurance Fund. Nowthat the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.) has control of twoinsurance funds, one for commercial banks and the other forthrifts, it had to come up with a name for the bank fund.   _FIRREA (pronounced fih-ree-ah). It stands for FinancialInstitutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. At aWhite House ceremony, President Bush said, ``I'm proud to sign thismonster.''   _The RTC (Resolution Trust Corp.) was created by FIRREA. It'scharged with disposing of billions of dollars in real estate thegovernment is inheriting from failed Sandamp;Ls. Members of Congressfervently hope the RTC (no catchy pronunciation) won't conduct aFIRREA sale, ruining property values in their district.</TEXT></DOC>
