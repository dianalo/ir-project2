The panel approved the INF pact on a 17-2 vote, with only Republican Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Larry Pressler of South Dakota opposing it. Both legislators are expected to propose conditions to the treaty when it reaches the Senate floor. Under the pact, the U.S. and the Soviet Union would eliminate intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles from their arsenals.    The Reagan administration, which completed negotiations with the Soviets on the accord last December, had been pursuing a &quot;clean treaty&quot; strategy -- that is, it wanted the pact approved without any conditions, or reservations, being attached.    But chances of that were wrecked earlier this week when the Senate panel approved a condition proposed by Democrats that a president can't change the interpretation of a treaty without Senate approval. The provision reflects Democrats' objection to the administration's contention that it has the right to reinterpret the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty in a way that would give more leeway for testing space-based defense systems.    Even though the Democrats' condition doesn't deal specifically with the intermediate-range missile pact, &quot;the floodgates are now open on amendments on the floor,&quot; predicted a GOP Senate aide. He said that other lawmakers in addition to Sens. Helms and Pressler would now feel free to offer an array of conditions or &quot;sense of the Senate&quot; resolutions.    But a Democratic committee aide contended that the condition was &quot;generic&quot; and consistent with efforts to avoid so-called killer amendments that would substantially alter the treaty and make it unacceptable to Moscow.    The GOP aide said the Democrats' condition is likely to prompt extensive debate on the treaty. The White House is hoping for Senate approval before President Reagan goes to Moscow in late May for a summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. But now, &quot;the debate timetable will run up against the Moscow timetable,&quot; the GOP aide said. </TEXT></DOC>
