The modification, or termination of U.S. sanctions againstSouth Africa, is contingent upon release of the prisoners. Adispute between the South African government and theanti-apartheid African National Congress over the definitionof political prisoners could complicate the determination asto whether all have been freed.</LP><TEXT>   The ANC, the main pro-democracy organization talking withthe government, accepts figures provided by the Human RightsCommission indicating that only 376 of 1,522 prisoners havebeen, or are set to be, released. The government contendsthat 535 have been released. And even with a &quot;very broaddefinition&quot; of the term &quot;political prisoner,&quot; there are only600 to 800 such prisoners, says a spokeswoman for theMinistry of Justice and Correctional Services.   The dispute over the number of political prisoners couldresult in the government's contending that all have beenreleased and the anti-apartheid forces' charging that manyremain in jail. Not only would that obstruct the negotiatingprocess, but it also would pose a dilemma for the Bushadministration, which must decide if the U.S. sanctions-lawprovision has been met.   Disputed cases are sent to a committee, which is appointedby President F.W. de Klerk, who may accept or reject itsrecommendations. If the prisoners aren't released by April30, the ANC has said it would review its participation in thepeace process with the government. In the ANC view, continueddetention of political prisoners is a major obstacle to thenegotiated death of apartheid and the development of anon-racial democratic society.   But what the ANC considers a deadline, the governmentcalls a &quot;target date.&quot; The Pretoria Minute, an Aug. 6agreement between the government and the ANC, said theprisoner-release process hopefully would be finished withinsix months, &quot;but the latest date envisaged for the completionof the total task . . . is not later than 30 April 1991.&quot;   If the date isn't met, &quot;We definitely will come forwardwith a strong response,&quot; said Carl Niehaus, an ANC spokesmanwho until recently was himself a political prisoner. &quot;For us,it is very clearly a deadline.&quot;   Commission member Max Coleman said the government hasreleased more prisoners this month than it had in theprevious eight months. Yet with 1,146 still being held, headded, it's impossible that they will be freed by the end ofthe month. &quot;We conclude that nothing less than a simplethrowing open of the prison gates to all those with a clearclaim to being in prison because of their resistance toapartheid will bring the issue to an end,&quot; he said.   Speaking to reporters in London, Mr. de Klerk rejectedestimates that more than 1,000 political prisoners remain,saying the number &quot;is below 200 at the moment.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
