The solutionshave been either to estimate the finding cost for an oil-gas aggregateor to allocate total finding costs between oil discoveries and gas discoveriesaccording to rules chosen by the researcher. In this paper the joint-costproblem is circumvented by estimating a multiple-output, explorationcost function which is used to calculate the predicted values of marginalfinding costs for oil and gas. These values are then compared with independentestimates of the shadow prices of reserves for oil and gas to help settlethe debate over whether marginal finding costs provide a good measureof rent. Data in this paper are taken from the exploration industry inAlberta. 20 refs., 2 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
