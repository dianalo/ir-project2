American Medical said it received about $500 million in cash, $230 million in preferred stock, and a note payable from the new company, Epic Healthcare Group. Epic also assumed an unspecified amount of American Medical debt. American Medical said the note and the debt have a combined value of $100 million, but the company declined to break out exact figures.    American Medical sold fewer properties, including one less hospital, and received about $100 million less in cash than anticipated when the plan was announced in May. At that time, the company valued the transaction at $873 million, including about $601 million in cash, $250 million in preferred stock and $22 million in a note. The new firm was expected to assume about $37 million in debt.    An American Medical spokesman said senior officials weren't available to explain the revised terms. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, American Medical closed at $17, unchanged.    At Epic headquarters in Dallas, Kenn S. George, chief executive officer, said the new company has estimated revenue of $1 billion and more than 10,000 employees in 10 states. American Medical retains a 20% stake in Epic through ownership of the preferred stock. </TEXT></DOC>
