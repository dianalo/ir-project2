The Board approved prices forthese new services in June 1988 and, at the same time, reduced forwardcollection fees (53 FR 24148, June 27, 1988). The new fees and servicesbecame effective September 1, 1988. Prior to September 1988, the FederalReserve Banks did not price returned checks explicitly but incorporatedthe cost of handling returned checks into their forward collection fees.The new Federal Reserve returned check services differ significantly fromthe return services provided by the Reserve Banks prior to the implementationof EFA. Reserve Banks now accept and process any returned check, and returnchecks directly to the depositary bank. In contrast, prior to September1, 1988, a Federal Reserve Bank accepted and processed only those returnedchecks it collected, and returned each check to the institution that depositedthe check with the Federal Reserve for forward collection.Reserve Banks also accelerated their handling of returned checks by processingreturns of local checks on an overnight basis and by dispatching them themorning following receipt. Nonlocal raw returns \1\<NOTE/> are qualified for automated processing prior to dispatchto the second Federal Reserve office on the evening following receipt.Nonlocal returns deposited in qualified form are dispatched to the secondFederal Reserve office on the night of receipt or the following night.Previously, Reserve Banks processed local returns during the day and dispatchedthem the following morning. Nonlocal returns were processed manually bytwo Reserve Bank offices, lengthening the return process by one day.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ A raw returned check is a return that has not been preparedfor automated processing. A qualified returned check (``QRC'') is a returnthat has been prepared for automated processing by placing a strip on thecheck, or placing the check in a carrier envelope, and encoding the stripor envelope with the routing number of the depositary bank, the amountof the check, and a special return identifier.The Federal Reserve adopted its returned check prices before the ReserveBanks had experience with the new returned check procedures. The new feeswere based on Reserve Bank estimates of the costs of providing these servicesand the revenue that would be received. Revenue projections were particularlydependent on the estimated proportion of returned checks that would bereceived by the Reserve Banks as either raw, qualified, or fine sort deposits.When it approved the new check prices, which were to be effective through1989, the Board indicated that it would review the prices in the springof 1989 to determine whether earlier adjustments to the fees for theseservices were warranted.Experience in late 1988 indicated that most Reserve Banks were receivinglower revenues than had been anticipated and that actual returned checkcosts exceeded estimates. This experience is reflected in the decline incheck service cost recovery from 101 percent for the first eight monthsof 1988, prior to the implementation of EFA and the new return services,to approximately 93 percent for the last four months of the year.The lower than anticipated returned check revenue is primarily due to agreater than expected proportion of deposits received in qualified formthan in raw form. Because qualified prices are lower than raw prices, ReserveBanks are receiving less revenue than projected. The primary cause of the higher than anticipated costs is the poor qualityof incoming returned check deposits. Even though most returns are beingdeposited in qualified form, the low quality of many of those depositsresults in significant costs for Reserve Banks. Poor physical quality ofthe returns, improper packaging, and noncompliance with the indorsementstandard, along with high returned check adjustment levels, have forcedReserve Banks to devote additional resources to return processing. ReserveBanks have worked with depository institutions to improve the quality ofreturn deposits and have also devoted considerable attention to improvingreturned check operations. Although the industry has been very cooperativeand quality has improved since the implementation of the new return services,problems persist. <ITAG tagnum="84">Quality Improvement Initiatives </ITAG>Reserve Banks are addressing returned check quality issues in a coordinatedfashion Systemwide, with the objective of achieving the same high qualityfor returned check processing as for the processing of forward collectionchecks. Several major initiatives are currently underway in the FederalReserve System that are expected to improve return operations. These initiativesinclude improving carrier envelope document quality, reducing the numberof misdirected qualified returned checks, improving indorsement quality,and reducing the reject rate of qualified deposits. Variations in the quality of carrier envelopes used in the QRC processresult in serious problems with envelopes that jam check equipment or thatcannot be properly indorsed or microfilmed. Federal Reserve guidelinesfor carrier envelope document quality are being finalized for release duringthe second quarter of 1989. These guidelines will provide carrier envelopecharacteristics that will increase the likelihood that a carrier can beprocessed on high-speed check equipment without operational difficulties.In addition, the American National Standards Institute has agreed to developlong-term carrier envelope specification standards. The Reserve Banks are also counselling institutions that encode returnsto the incorrect institution, thus causing the returns to be misdirected.This problem slows the return of the check to the depositary bank and addssignificantly to Reserve Bank and depository institution adjustment cases.Alerting those institutions that create this problem and advising themon how to qualify returned checks properly should result in a decline inthe number of misdirected qualified returns. The major underlying quality problem that results in misdirected QRCs andreturns for which the depositary bank cannot be identified is the lackof adherence by the depositary bank to the Regulation CC indorsement standard.Unreadable indorsements caused the misrouting and delay of returned checks,thereby precluding the expenditious return of these checks. To facilitatecompliance with the indorsement standard, each Federal Reserve office hasefforts underway to determine the major indorsement problems in its regionand to work directly with institutions and equipment vendors to improveindorsement quality. In addition, the Federal Reserve is actively investigatingalternative, more efficient indorsement processes, such as machine-readableindorsements using bar-code technology, that would automate the processof reading indorsements and decrease the likelihood of incorrectly readingthe indorsement. The poor quality of many qualified returned checks causes them to rejectwhen processed on automated check equipment. The Reserve Banks have establishedQRC reject rate policies to improve the quality of deposits. Most ReserveBanks have notified their depository institutions that, beginning February1, 1989, qualified return letters that have reject rates above a certainpercent will be treated as raw returns and be charged the raw, rather thanthe qualified, price, with availability on those items to be deferred byone day. The reject rate threshold in most Districts is 15 percent. Themajority of returned check cash letters have reject rates well below 15percent; therefore, this threshold will affect only the relatively fewinstitutions whose dposits create the most significant operational problems.Reserve Banks will review their threshold rates periodically and lowerthem as the overall quality of qualified return deposits improves. Institutionsthat are depositing poor quality QRC cash letters are being counseled bytheir local Federal Reserve Bank on the specific problems with their cashletters so that they can take the necessary actions to improve the qualityof their deposits.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>Despite ongoing efforts to improve the quality of incoming returned checkdeposits, revised 1989 cost and revenue estimates, based on the fees ineffect as of September 1, 1988, indicate that total check costs are expectedto exceed anticipated revenues. As of January 1989, Reserve banks projecteda Systemwide 1989 cost recovery rate of 98.6 percent in the check collectionand return service. This figure is significantly below the budgeted costrecovery rate of 103.4 percent. Based on the revised low recovery rateestimate and the experience of higher returned check costs, the Board concludedthat the System should reprice its returned check services as of May 1989,with the new prices to remain in effect at least until December 31, 1989.Returned check prices will be reviewed again in the fall as part of theannual repricing of all Federal Reserve Bank services, with any fee adjustmentsto take effect on January 1, 1990. The adjustments to Federal Reserve returned check prices reflect returnedcheck costs more accurately, by recovering, at a minimum, Federal Reservefloor costs (i.e., direct and support costs). Based on revised returnedcheck prices, the Federal Reserve anticipates recovering total check costsduring the time that the new prices are in effect, i.e., May through December1989. The new prices reflect anticipated cost reductions resulting fromfuture quality improvements. The estimated total check cost recovery after the returned check fee changesis 102.9 percent for the period May-December 1989, and 100.5 percent forthe year. The total cost for the check service in 1989, including the privatesector adjustment factor, is projected to be $540.9 million. Total revenueis estimated to be $543.5 million. There are a total of 730 returned checkproducts, and of this total, 633 prices have increased and 97 remain unchanged.the new raw return fees are an average of $0.19 more than current fees,bringing the System average price to $0.72. The new qualified return pricesincrease current fees an average of $0.14, resulting in a new System averageprice of $0.212. These fee changes increase the spread between the Systemaverage raw and qualified prices from $0.46 to $0.51. Four districts haveincreased their return fine sort fees an average of $0.0022, to reflectthe higher adjustment costs associated with fine sort returns. Although the Reserve Banks expect aggregate return volume to be stable,they project considerable movement among products based on past volumetrends and the effects of the proposed price changes. Reserve Banks estimatethat the Federal Reserve will handle 228 million returned checks in 1989.They project that 76 percent of the returns will be qualifed prior to depositwith the Reserve Bank, 22 percent deposited as raw returns, and 2 percentdeposited as fine sort deposits (in contrast to earlier budget estimatesof 55 percent, 44 percent, and 1 percent, respectively). Reserve Banksthat will have relatively high qualified prices expect an increase in finesort volume. Reserve Banks that have increased significantly the spreadbetween raw and qualified prices project an increase in qualified deposits.A wider price spread between raw and qualifed return prices encouragesinstitutions to deposit their returned checks in qualified form, whichexpedites the return process, and also provides greater incentives to correspondentbanks to offer returned check services in which they accept raw returnedchecks, deliver some returns directly to the depositary bank, and qualifyother returns for delivery through a Reserve Bank. Copies of the new fee schedules for the Federal Reserve returned checkservice are available from local Federal Reserve Banks. <ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,March 16, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William W.
