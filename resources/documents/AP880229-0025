(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The union representing 6,700 NorthwestAirlines flight attendants continued to threaten to strike Sundaynight although both sides in the labor talks said just one issuedivided them.   Negotiators for the airline and the union met with a federalmediator for four hours Sunday and agreed on all but one contractissue, according to Northwest spokesman William Wren.   William Genoese, international director of the InternationalBrotherhood of Teamsters airline division, agreed that only oneissue separated the two sides _the issue of how long newly hiredworkers will stay on a lower pay scale. But he declined tocharacterize the rest of the day's discussions except to say ``wetalked around'' other issues.   A strike was still a possibility, he said late Sunday.   ``At this moment we're in strike position. It can happen twominutes from now or any other time. Under the law, we have thatright,'' Genoese said about 9:30 p.m. CST Sunday.   About two hours later, after meeting with other unionnegotiators, Genoese said ``tomorrow (Monday) will be the reallybig day.'' Monday is the first weekday since the contract expiredat midnight Friday.   Northwest officials said Sunday the airline continued to operatea normal flight schedule. No delays were reported at airportsserved by the carrier.   Genoese and Northwest agreed that the only sticking point in thenegotiations is Northwest's proposal to stretch from five to nineyears the time in which an employee advances from a ``B'' or lowerpay scale to the ``A'' pay rate. The union is resisting theproposal.   The airline issued a press release Sunday night saying that itscontract offered the union would make the flight attendants thesecond-highest-paid in the airline industry.   According to Northwest, the contract, which would run throughDec. 31, 1992, also calls for two 2 percent wage increases for allflight attendants through 1992 and lump sum bonus payments in 1988and 1989.   Earlier in the day, the two sides had been reported to be aparton other issues such as the length of the contract and retroactivepay.   A strike deadline last Friday night was extended as the twosides continued negotiations that began Wednesday. The two sidesresumed talks one day after the Teamsters airline divisionannounced that nearly 95 percent of the attendants had authorized astrike.   On Saturday, the talks broke off, but a union spokesman saidstrike preparations had been ``put on hold.''   Genoese said late Saturday that a request by the federalmediator to delay a strike helped avert a walkout Saturday morning.   Meanwhile, there was no word on whether flight attendant picketlines would be honored by pilots or machinists if there is a strike.   Spokesmen for the pilots' union were in a meeting Sunday morningto discuss the flight attendants' matter and were unavailable forcomment.   If flight attendants do strike, the airline has said it willkeep flying.   About 2,000 managers trained as flight attendants were postedthroughout the Northwest system with 200 newly hired replacementflight attendants also ready to move, Terry Erskine, the airline'svice president for law and labor relations, said Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
