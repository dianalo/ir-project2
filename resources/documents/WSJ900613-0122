Philips, Olivetti End Talks Aimed   At Cooperating in Computer Business   ----   By Bob Hagerty and Guy Collins   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/13/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><CO>   PHG I.OLV</CO><IN>COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)</IN><LP>   N.V. Philips and C. Olivetti andamp; Co. said they had endednegotiations aimed at cooperating in the computer business.   Analysts called the failure of the talks another blow toPhilips's flagging restructuring program, particularlybecause the Dutch electronics company's unprofitable computerbusiness is viewed as one of its biggest problem areas. &quot;Theyneed to do something quickly,&quot; said Bill Coleman, an analystat James Capel andamp; Co., London.</LP><TEXT>   Neither company would elaborate on the reasons for thefailure of the talks, which were first announced in April.Industry analysts said they believed Olivetti had beeninterested in acquiring control of the Philips computerdivision in some form, but had concluded that such anoperation wouldn't make commercial sense at a time when theindustry is facing severe pressure on margins.   The talks &quot;were probably broken off by Olivetti afterlooking at the core Philips business,&quot; said Dorian Foyil, ananalyst at UBS Phillips andamp; Drew, London. Analysts also saidthere could have been problems concerning the Philips productrange and the potential cost of restructuring its operations.   A Philips spokesman said the company is discussingpossible cooperation with other companies, but he refused toelaborate. The company, based in the Netherlands, has beeneven more tight-lipped than usual since mid-May, when itannounced a management shake-up under which its president,Cornelis van der Klugt, agreed to leave the company July 1, ayear earlier than expected. His successor will be Jan Timmer,who currently heads the consumer electronics division.   Mr. van der Klugt has favored retaining control of thecomputer business, which ranks 11th or 12th in Europe and isconsidered by many analysts to be too small and ill-focusedto thrive on its own. At a news conference in March, Mr. vander Klugt said Philips wanted to find a computer alliancethat would let the Dutch company &quot;be masters in our ownhouse.&quot;   Thus, some analysts speculated that an obstacle in thetalks with Olivetti might have been Philips's unwillingnessto give up enough control over its computer line.   It isn't clear whether Mr. Timmer will be more willing tolet go of the computer business than was Mr. van der Klugt.But a Philips spokesman insisted that computers are &quot;veryimportant&quot; to the company, adding, &quot;There is no intention tostep out of that business.&quot;   Philips officials have long argued that the computerdivision is closely linked to the company's technologicalstrengths in video screens and optical-storage systems. Someanalysts have argued, however, that Philips would bewell-positioned to market such technology even if it nolonger manufactured computers.   Philips might provide some hints about its computerstrategy July 2, when shareholders attend an extraordinarymeeting to vote on the recent management changes. Analystsare eagerly awaiting Mr. Timmer's comments at that meeting.   He is widely viewed as willing to make tough decisions. &quot;Ithink he'll be a man in a hurry,&quot; Capel's Mr. Coleman said.   Olivetti also is expected to continue looking at otherpossible alliances. The Italian company's chairman, Carlo DeBenedetti, said recently that it was interested in forgingaccords either to acquire technology on a sector-by-sectorbasis or to win market share. Company officials have said itis keeping various options open through contacts in theindustry.   Olivetti's consolidated net profit last year fell 43% to202.8 billion lire ($163 million) from 356.2 billion lire in1988, despite a 7.4% rise in sales.</TEXT></DOC>
