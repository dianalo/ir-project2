<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-66-0941 </DOCNO><TEXT>A number of technically feasible alternative riser systems exist for tensionleg platform (TLP) production systems in deep water. These include conventionalsteel, steel with added buoyancy, titanium, and carbon-fiber composite.The last three of these options provide substantial reductions in requiredriser tension for a 1200-m [3,935-ft] depth. For a minimum-size TLP,these reduced tensions translate into substantial reductions in fabricatedsteel weight. Replacing conventional top tensioners with a hard-mountor gimbal arrangement requires a relatively small increase in top tension,which would be balanced out by weight savings on the tensioning equipment.Operational concerns related to pressure and temperature changes mustbe addressed to ensure feasibility of the hard-mount or gimbal approach.</TEXT></DOC>
