Voters in Washingtonstate can be excused for feeling the same way. The state'sentire political establishment is trying to take away theirright to vote on limiting the terms of elected officials.   Washington state is the latest battleground forterm-limits, which have already been passed in Oklahoma,Colorado, California and a half dozen cities fromJacksonville to San Antonio. Initiative 553 is the mostradical proposal yet. State officials would be limited to nomore than eight years in office, U.S. House Members to sixyears and U.S. Senators to two six-year terms. In addition, aretroactive clause would mean that the state's entire Housedelegation, including Speaker Tom Foley, would have to leaveoffice in 1995.</LP><TEXT>   The retroactive nature of the initiative may well lead toa first-time defeat for term-limits, if some voters decidethe measure would cost the state too much clout inWashington, D.C. But the state's power brokers aren't takingany chances: Preliminary polls show 70% of the state's votersback term-limits.   A lawsuit to remove the initiative from the Novemberballot maintains that the state's constitution must beamended for term-limits to be legal. Initiative 553 onlychanges statute law. But the only way to amend theconstitution is for two-thirds of the legislature to approveany changes first. Asking state legislators to votethemselves out of a job is like asking chickens to deliverthemselves to Colonel Sanders.   The anti-term limit lawsuit strikes us as specious, andKenneth Eikenberry, the state's attorney general, promises todefend the people's right to vote on the issue in court. Butthe lawsuit has flushed the opponents of term-limits out oftheir suites.   The anti-term limit coalition is led by the League ofWomen Voters, which is supposed to favor more citizenparticipation in politics; the Washington State Grange, thefarming lobby; and the Washington Environmental Council, afrequent critic of the Grange.   Other groups include: Common Cause, the so-called&quot;political reform&quot; lobby; the state Trial LawyersAssociation; and the state Labor Council. Corporations thathave given money to stop term-limits include U.S. WestCommunications, Puget Power and Washington Natural Gas. &quot;Thelimitation of terms is not constitutional,&quot; says SpeakerFoley, a 27-year veteran of Congress, who has joined the suitto throw term-limits off the ballot.   The forces lining up to oppose a citizen legislature givethe lie to claims that special interests would thrive underterm-limits by exploiting naive, rookie officeholders.Indeed, it looks as if every interest group in the statewants to protect its investment in making legislators&quot;sensitive&quot; to their needs.   With 20 states likely to vote on limiting terms in 1992,the only way opponents may be able to stop the term-limitjuggernaut is with legal chicanery and an imaginative,self-serving reading of the Constitution.</TEXT></DOC>
