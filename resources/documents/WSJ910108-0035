Afirst-quarter survey of over 15,000 firms by Manpower, thebig temporary-help firm, found for the first time since 1983that more plan layoffs than new hiring.   &quot;It probably is going to get worse before it gets better,&quot;says Mitchell Fromstein, Manpower's president.                                                                                                          SALARY INCREASES will slow in 1991, surveys show.   Fully 20% of 91 large firms queried by Buck Consultantslowered their 1991 salary budgets from mid-1990 plans. Payraises will average 5.1% to 5.4%, down from 5.3% to 5.8% in1990. Basic pay ranges will rise on average 3.6% to 3.8%,down from 3.9% to 4% last year.   Linda Ulrich, a compensation analyst for Buck, foresees &quot;aconservative approach to merit increases.&quot; At 412 companiesquestioned by Sibson andamp; Co., 1991 salary increases willaverage between 4.6% and 4.8%, down from a range of 5.2% to5.7% projected last September. About 23% of the companiestrimmed their salary-boost plans.                                                                                                          CURBS ON STRIKEBREAKING by employers top unions'legislative agenda.   A bill that would ban permanent replacement of strikers,proposed in the wake of walkouts at Eastern Airlines,Greyhound and the New York Daily News, heads the unions'list. &quot;We'll be prepared to do everything we can to get itenacted,&quot; says AFL-CIO chief lobbyist Robert McGlotten. A newlabor group, Americans for Workplace Fairness, will push forthe measure, which is expected to fare better in the Housethan in the Senate.   Other high union priorities are new civil-rights andparental-leave bills, plus a measure to eliminate restraintson political activity by federal workers. All were vetoed byPresident Bush last year. A civil-rights bill seems mostlikely to pass this year with veto-override strength. OSHAreform also is sought.   The AFL-CIO and state labor groups will fight efforts tolimit terms of members of Congress and state lawmakers.                                                                                                          THINNER SAUCE for the gander? The House scrapped a planthat would have completely excluded most of its staff fromeligibility for overtime pay. But it ruled that many stafferscould be given compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay.The House only made its staffers eligible for overtime lastyear. The Senate doesn't pay or give extra time off forovertime.                                                                                                          MEMBER POOR, MONEY RICH? Too much is made of unions'membership loss, a decline of 5.3 million from 1976 to 1987,says George Mason University economist James Bennett. Hisstudy says that union coffers, thanks to big dues hikes, haveheld up well, helping labor boost its political clout.                                                                                                          DOCTORS FARE WELL, an American Medical Association studyshows. Average physician income rose to $155,800 in 1989 from$144,700 in 1988. Surgeons were tops, with an average$220,500, and family doctors earned the least, $95,900.Pathologists got an 18% pay jump, the biggest increase.                                                                                                          A HOMOSEXUAL EMPLOYEE charges Amtrak with discriminationfor denying his request for a free train pass for his lover.Amtrak often gives such passes to married workers' spouses.The passenger railroad said its policy follows IRS guidelinesfor dependent benefits, which require a &quot;legally recognizedmarriage.&quot;                                                                                                          PHONE LINES AND VIDEOTAPES help explain benefits toworkers.   Employers are trying harder to make sense out ofincreasingly complex pension, health and other benefits.Metropolitan Life Insurance, Candamp;S/Sovran, AlbanyInternational, Aetna Life andamp; Casualty, Scott Paper, SunTrustBanks, General Dynamics and Rohr Industries use videotapes,hotlines or computer systems to answer employee queries aboutbenefit choices and changes.   They have a lot of explaining to do. Employees findflexible benefit plans confusing; MetLife offers 23 medical,dental, life insurance and disability plans. Candamp;S/Sovranconcedes that workers are &quot;frustrated&quot; by its communications.General Dynamics says some employees worry about whether itsinvestments hotline is confidential. Rockwell admits itsbooklets are &quot;legalistic.&quot; But partly because of the newcommunications programs, employees want -- or are forced --to learn, firms say.   Employees who share their healthcare costs show moreinterest in their benefits, says SunTrust Banks.
