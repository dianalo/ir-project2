Consumers could ultimately come out the winners under thefederal ruling because the two companies could reach across-licensing agreement that would ensure a stable and perhapscheaper supply of the drug, analysts said Tuesday.   The case began two years ago when Amgen Inc. sued GeneticsInstitute Inc. for allegedly infringing on the biotech company'spatent covering the production of erythropoietin, or EPO.   Genetics Institute countersued, claiming it held the rights tothe protein itself, which stimulates the production of red bloodcells and is often used to treat kidney disease.   U.S. Magistrate Patti B. Saris issued a 184-page ruling Mondayin which she found both patents to be mostly valid, meaning thateach company had infringed on the other's patent rights.   ``The greatest likely impact is greatly enhanced chances fornegotiations leading to a settlement, which would involvecross-licensing for both parties,'' said David Webber, a biotechstock analyst with Alex. Brown andamp; Sons in New York.   Both parties may file an appeal in the case, but analysts saidthe protracted battle would likely end in a compromise that wouldallow Amgen, which has already secured Food and Drug Administrationapproval, to continue marketing EPO in the United States.   For GI, cross-licensing would mean the company could use theAmgen-patented process to manufacture EPO domestically, where theestimated potential market for the drug is at least $200 million.   Webber said Monday's ruling left a ``plethora of potential legaloutcomes, but there is increased incentive for Amgen to negotiateon an even-handed basis with GI because there's an increased chancethat Amgen could lose its right to market EPO in the UnitedStates.''   Lawyers for both companies said they had not yet decided whattheir next step would be, but none ruled out the possibility of acompromise.   ``In my mind it's somewhat of a common-sense type of thing,''said Eugene Moroz, whose firm represents GI's Japanese partner,Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. ``But that's assuming you can get twofighting parties together after a long battle.''   Mark Brand, a spokesman for Amgen, said only that the companywas examining ``all the options'' and would not rush a decision onwhether to appeal the ruling.   Genetics Institute was awarded a patent for the substance EPO inJune 1987, but the scientist who purified the EPO described in thepatent application used conventional chemistry to create it   Amgen got a patent the following October for identifying the EPgene and for creating genetically engineered cells that contain andproduce it.   In effect, the only commercially viable way to produce GeneticsInstitute's patented EPO is by using Amgen's patented process.   ``What we have here is two patents and two infringers,'' saidLinda Miller, an analyst with PaineWebber Group Inc. in Boston.``It's sort of a ping-pong match going back and forth and back andforth.''   Gary Hatton, editor of Biotech Stock Letter in Waltham, Mass.said cross-licensing could benefit consumers by bringing bothcompanies into the market, thus stabilizing sources of the supply,and also potentially undercutting prices.   ``Because Chugai is behind in the actual marketing of the drug,they may come in at sort of a price discount, so you get somecompetition,'' he said.   Webber said the ruling was also significant in that it upheldpatents in the relatively untried biotechnology field.   ``It's one of the first federal court rulings regardinggenetically-engineered proteins used as therapeutic drugs,'' hesaid. ``There's been a lot of uncertainty where ownership asindicated by patents would end up in this field.''   Hatton agreed.   ``It's a tremendously important suit ... for the biotechindustry because before any venture capitalist puts money into theindustry he has to believe these products are going to getpatents,'' he said. ``It reduces a huge uncertainty and the effectis an increased stability.''</TEXT></DOC>
