The increase will mean a jump in rates on a variety of consumerloans pegged to the prime, including home-equity loans. It lso willraise borrowing costs for companies that rely on banks for financing.   Economists had been predicting a prime rate increase becauseinterest rates in the bond markets had risen recently due toinflation fears and the dollar's weakness in foreign exchangemarkets.   The financial markets had no major reaction to the announcement.Stock and bond prices were up modestly, while the dollar steadiedagainst other major currencies.   ``It comes as no surprise. In fact, they (banks) seem to haveheld back longer than I expected,'' said Edward Yardeni, chiefeconomist for the investment firm Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan also has warned ofhigher short-term rates unless the government trims its huge budgetdeficit, the source of the dollar's woes.   ``There's a building perception in the marketplace that the Fedis, in fact, tightening conditions ...,'' said William V. Sullivan,an economist for the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   Sullivan and other economists predicted the Fed might soon raiseits discount rate, or the interest it charges on loans to memberbanks. If that happened, the prime rate could be increased again,they said.   ``I'd look for something (from the Fed) in the next two weeks,''said Yardeni.   Chase Manhattan was the first institution to increase its primerate Monday and other major banks quickly joined the move.   The prime stood at 8.5 percent at the start of the year and hasbeen raised four times since. Monday's increase put the key lendingrate at its highest level since May 20, 1985, when it was lowered ahalf percentage point to 10 percent.   The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money,including interest it pays on on savings accounts or certificates ofdeposit, and trails more subtle increases in other interest rates.   But the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basisfor calculating loans to businesses and for determining many typesof fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans. Mortgage rates are notincluded in that category.   ``It's clear that consumers will be absorbing higher borrowingcosts in December or early next year,'' said Sullivan.   Economists were uncertain as to what effect the latest increasewould have on the economy, and more specifically on consumers'spending during the holiday season.   James L. Kochan, chief fixed-income strategist for Merrill LynchCapital Markets Inc., said, ``I think the direct effect is prettysmall because generally consumers aren't affected by modest increassin interest rates ....''   But Yardeni said some credit-happy consumers might want to cutback on spending and ``buy only things that they can afford.''   ``There's an underlying sense of uneasiness because so manypeople have been through rough times even when the economy wasstrong. The prime rate hike coming into the Christmas season maymake people more cautious,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
