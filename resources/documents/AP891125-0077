WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East Germans worried that the drive to revivetheir economy could churn out more pollutants and darken thebrown-coal haze over the nation have formed their ownenvironmentalist Greens Party.   East Germany is one of Europe's most contaminated countries,with rivers awash in industrial effluent and air so heavy withsmoke that visibility is cut to a few blocks in cities such asLeipzig and Dresden.   Conditions in Leipzig gave birth to a broad opposition movementthat embraces pro-democracy activists as well as champions ofenvironmental protection.   The East German Greens want ``direct influence'' on nationalaffairs and will field candidates in elections for Parliament andexecutive posts, founding member Gerhard Baecher was quoted assaying in Saturday's National Zeitung, a state-run newspaper.   Political parties outside the Communist-controlled Parliamentare not recognized by East German authorities, although officialshave recently tolerated public activities by the growing number ofunsanctioned pro-reform movements.   Opposition groups as well as many senior Communists have calledfor free elections as early as next year. But a new election lawmust be worked out first to set conditions on candidacy andballoting, and the various political factions have not yetclarified who will draft the legislation.   ``Without a functioning environment, there can be no functioningsociety,'' Baecher was quoted by National Zeitung as saying.   He said the party, like its Western counterparts, would alsochampion the causes of women, non-violence and ``totaldisarmament.''   ``Militarism threatens not only peace and security, but it isthe greater environmental danger as well,'' Baecher said.   West Germany's Greens have been a political force for more thana decade and have had parliamentary representation since 1982. Thecasually clad legislators have shouted down conservatives orknitted during lengthy parliamentary debates.   In a break with traditional Greens policy, Baecher conceded thatEast Germany cannot for the time being renounce the use of nuclearpower.   The East German Greens have instead proposed boostingalternative energy sources, like solar and wind power, over thenext few years to cover 10 percent of national needs.   Baecher also spoke out for better ties between the two Germanstates to help East Germany convert from using brown coal as itsprimary source of industrial energy production.   ``Such improved ties could assist in the short-term conversionto hard coal,'' he told the newspaper. ``West Germany sits ongigantic mounds of hard coal that they can't even begin to use. Wecould use it to reduce emissions by as much as 50 percent.''   East Germany's new environment minister, Hans Reichelt, toldreporters in East Berlin on Friday that a turn away from brown coalwas not possible soon.   The nation's major industrial facilities are powered by the softcoal, which emits significantly higher levels of sulfur than hardcoal. Soft brown coal of the type used extensively in easternEurope is banned or severely restricted in most Western countries.   Reichelt said he expected double the funding for environmentalcleanup projects beginning next year and said more stringentcontrols on emission and effluent were being developed.   Baecher said the new party will seek radio, television andnewspaper exposure to raise environmental consciousness among the16.5 million East Germans.</TEXT></DOC>
