But today, theflow of Canadian people and money across that line has becomean exodus.   Henry Jelinek's family has operated a cork company here inOakville for more than 40 years, ever since they fledCzechoslovakia in the 1940s and settled in Canada. It hasflourished. &quot;This country has been good to us,&quot; says Mr.Jelinek, the company president, sitting in an officesurrounded by wine-bottle corks and other products. &quot;I feel asense of patriotism, and I will stay in Canada.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Stay in Canada, yes. But all of Mr. Jelinek's expansion istaking place across the border in Lockport, N.Y. Land isone-tenth as expensive in Lockport. Taxes are lower. Wagesare about $5.50 an hour, compared with about $10 an hour inOntario. The quality of labor is higher in western New York,too, Mr. Jelinek believes.   Herein lies the hottest issue in Canada these days. On onelevel, it is the flood of weekend Canadian shoppers who haverealized that gasoline, beer, clothing and other items aremuch cheaper south of the Canadian border. On another level,there is the exodus -- difficult to quantify but potentiallysignificant -- of factories, jobs and even companyheadquarters from Canada to the U.S.   &quot;We're concerned,&quot; says Joan Sutton Straus, the governmentof Ontario's senior representative in New York. &quot;But we don'thave a Berlin Wall at the border.&quot;   At the core of the divisive debate on the migration iswhether the culprit is the U.S.-Canada free-trade agreementof 1988, which removes trade barriers over 10 years. On oneside is the federal government in Ottawa and the moreentrepreneurial sectors of Canadian business. They see a hugemarket south of the border, waiting to be tapped. Businessmensuch as Mr. Jelinek argue that profits made in the U.S. willbe repatriated to Canada.   Arrayed against them are labor leaders who tally up200,000 lost jobs over the past two years in Ontario alone.They are joined by protected industries worried aboutextinction, and liberal-left government officials who believethat Canada's way of life -- abundant social servicesfinanced by high taxation -- is being sacrificed on the altarof free trade.   The debate's results may eventually influence events southof the border, because Canada's debate today could foreshadowa similar debate in the U.S. tomorrow. Although a U.S.-Mexicofree-trade agreement would be less tumultuous for the U.S.economy, the debate on free trade with both Mexico and Canadaalready has opened divisions within U.S. society thatresemble those in Canada.   As was the case with Ottawa, the administration inWashington favors a free-trade agreement. So does much ofU.S. business. The recent debate in the U.S. Congress foundthe bitter opponents among organized labor, protectedindustries and many liberal Democrats. Canadians watching theproceedings on television had an acute sense of deja vu.   Is it really the free-trade agreement that has caused theeconomic conundrum in Canada? Not really, say someauthoritative Canadian voices. A recent study by the RoyalBank of Canada, the country's largest commercial bank,concluded that high labor costs, taxes, interest rates andthe strong Canadian dollar are the main reasons for the flowof shopping and investment across the border. The free-tradepact ranked eighth, and last, among reasons the study cited.   Still, the debate has gathered force as Canadian weekendshoppers have flooded across the border over the past twoyears. And why not? Gasoline in Canada is $2.50 a gallon ormore (in U.S. currency). A case of Labatt's beer is $12 inNew York, $25 in Canada. Clothing and furniture are cheaperin the U.S., and shoppers say the selection is better. Atsome Buffalo shopping malls, 40% of the cars have Canadianlicense plates on weekends.   Canadian retailers and Canadian tax coffers feel thepinch. The loss of retail sales in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario,alone was $100 million in 1990, according to a study by Ernstandamp; Young, the accounting firm.   Bargain-hunting entrepreneurs are also becoming morevisible over the border. So far, most are smallmanufacturers, but there have also been someattention-grabbing moves. Varity Corp., the holding companyfor Massey-Ferguson, recently announced that it was movingits headquarters to Buffalo from Toronto.   Although the most sophisticated Canadian businesses havebeen active in the U.S. for years, or even decades, now comesa wave of niche players, often spurred on by all the hubbubover free trade.   &quot;We're doing business in Iran and the Soviet Union --across language barriers, across time zones. But we've begunto realize that there's a tremendous opportunity right on ourdoorstep, in the U.S.,&quot; says Barrie S. Hawkins, vicepresident of Giffels Consultants International, aToronto-based engineering firm.   Other Canadians are teaming up with U.S. companies.Sutherland-Schultz Ltd., an industrial-automation concern inKitchener, Ontario, has forged alliances with Eaton Corp.,General Electric Co., Texas Instruments Inc. and the U.Sunits of German and Japanese companies in the past two years.In 1990, the company had a sixfold increase in revenue fromjoint-venture products, which consist of linkages betweencomputers and factory machines. Today, the company says 95%of its $85 million in annual sales are outside Ontario.   &quot;The `Canadian' style is that you wait for the business tocome to you,&quot; says James Balsillie, executive vice presidentof Sutherland-Schultz. &quot;We were gadflies at trade shows. Ourattitude was to persevere -- push, push, push.&quot;   The strategy isn't foolproof. Sutherland-Schultz isembroiled in a patent dispute with its oldest partner,Allen-Bradley Co. &quot;We're both upset,&quot; Mr. Balsillie says. Butthe company remains committed to aggressive expansion intothe huge American market. And, on a recent morning inToronto, as Mr. Balsillie held forth on his company's U.S.efforts, 150 business people listened attentively.   Much of the activity occurs close to the border betweenthe two countries. In Washington state, in Minnesota, in NewEngland and in upstate New York, local officials, privatedevelopers, bankers and industrial-development specialistssee more investment and more interest from Canadian business.Bankers such as Ian Gent, vice president of Fleet/Norstar'soutpost in Buffalo, say the number of joint ventures issoaring.   Perhaps nowhere is the activity more prominent than inBuffalo, once the butt of jokes, the capital of the snowbelt, a city whose heyday as a steel and transportation hubpassed long ago. Today, there are unmistakable signs ofrevival, including two new office towers built with Canadianmoney. Buffalo's unemployment rate has fallen from amid-1980s high of 13% to 6.9%; Canada's is 10.3%.   On the site of an old Bethlehem Steel works, which hugsLake Erie for more than a mile just south of Buffalo, privatedeveloper Richard Garman is trying to put small-scalemanufacturing in recycled buildings and new structures, somebuilt on the rubble of the razed steel works. Pointing to onegroup of buildings, one of Mr. Garman's lieutenants, DanielBicz, says, &quot;We call this Canada Row.&quot; Inside are smallCanadian steel companies, trucking firms, trading companiesand others, mostly engaged in cross-border business.   Mr. Bicz isn't gloating over the company's ability toattract Canadian firms. &quot;Everybody up there {in Ontario} isso paranoid, but we aren't up there trying to stealanything,&quot; he says. &quot;Toronto attracts the sophisticatedthings. We attract the blue-collar component. So Buffalo islike a blue-collar suburb of Toronto.&quot;   Canadian labor leaders are understandably alarmed by thesouthward drift of business. They see U.S. companies closingunnecessary Canadian facilities, as a harsh new era dawns. Ina letter to the Toronto Star last December, Canadian AutoWorkers president Robert White complained: &quot;The society thatwe are moving towards under free trade is narrow, mean andultimately dangerous.&quot;   That may be extreme, but many Canadians argue that thecountry was thrown into free trade unprepared.   &quot;We can't compete,&quot; says Hazel McCallion, the mayor ofMississauga, Ontario, a prosperous city of 450,000 close toToronto. She and others argue that the recession in bothCanada and the U.S. only aggravated the hardships anddislocations that came when free trade removed the protectivecocoon around workers and industries.   The way many Canadians see it, theirs is a more civilizedsociety. Taxes are high, but social services abound.Government pays for medical care. University tuition is low.Unemployment benefits are generous. All these things, forbetter or worse, jack up the prices of goods. Canadians fretthat free trade will endanger the system.   &quot;This has brought out all the old myths and fears -- theAmericanization of Canada,&quot; says Mr. Gent, the Buffalobanker, himself a Canadian.   Lately, some Americans have perceived a frostier attitudenorth of the border. James Allen, head of the industrialdevelopment agency in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst, tells ofthe typical response to efforts to get Canadian companies tolocate in Amherst, where 15% of the 400 companies in thetown's industrial park are Canadian. &quot;You put an ad in ajournal and get 100 responses. It's phenomenal,&quot; he says.   But now, Mr. Allen says, some Canadians &quot;don't want usthere any more.&quot;He says Americans are suddenly closed out oftrade shows that he and associates used to attend to lureCanadian companies. Trade journals in Canada seem reluctantto accept ads from Amherst. At a trade show in suburbanToronto last month, he says, Canadian government officialsharassed some Buffalo area officials.   Peter Sadlier-Brown, a trade official in the provincialOntario government, responds: &quot;I find this difficult tobelieve. I would be surprised -- very surprised -- if theseactivities have official sanction.&quot;   What do have official blessings, he says, are moves topromote advanced industry -- in technology, in environmentalengineering, in mass transit and in medical products andservices. He advocates, in short, a government-assistedindustrial strategy.   One way or another, the Canadian government is underpressure to deal with the economic difficulties. That isespecially true of the provincial government in Ontario, thenewly elected Social Democratic administration of Premier BobRae. Some of its recent pronouncements, however, leavebusiness nervous, such as a proposal to hold corporate boardsresponsible for layoffs. The idea has since been withdrawn.   &quot;There's a scary government in Ontario,&quot; says Mr. Jelinek,the cork maker.   Regardless of who has run the Ontario government, theproblems facing Canadian entrepreneurs have been building forsome time. Mr. Jelinek speaks with a trace of sadness aboutthe labor problems he encountered in Canada during the boomtimes of the late 1980s.   &quot;Three years ago, when the economy was booming, it wasvery hard to find employees,&quot; he says. &quot;Productivity wasterrible,&quot; and &quot;boy, did they sock it to us&quot; on wages. Hesays longtime employees sometimes went to competitorsoffering raises of only 10 cents an hour.   To Mr. Jelinek, the choice of expanding in Lockport, N.Y.,while keeping his Canadian factory, is most welcome. It's thebest way to compete for U.S. business, he says. And he isparticularly happy with his U.S. labor force inonce-depressed Lockport.   &quot;They've known tough times,&quot; he says. &quot;They seem to wanttheir jobs more. I've been very pleased.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
