C. Olivetti andamp; Co.'s manualtypewriters have been known for years throughout East Europe.Now, with emerging democracies there pushing formodernization, the company thinks the market is ready for itspersonal computers, cash registers and other electronicequipment.   &quot;We are planning to set up a joint venture in Hungary toproduce software, market our goods and provide servicing,&quot;says Ettore Morezzi, the senior Olivetti official responsiblefor its East Europe strategy. The company also is planningbusiness ventures in Czechoslovakia.</LP><TEXT>   While politics kept out many Western companies during theCold War, such Italian giants as Fiat S.p.A. and thestate-owned holding companies Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi andIstituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale continued to dobusiness there, particularly in the Soviet Union. Now,Italian companies in everything from banking to heavyindustry are moving into Eastern Europe with little of thehesitation of some of their Western competitors.   Despite the enormous political and financial risks, theyare making major commitments in the region, hoping to cash inon what they see as their national advantages: experience,geographic proximity and exporting zeal.   In Poland, for example, where Fiat cars have beenmanufactured under license since the 1930s, Fiat isnegotiating to produce its new Tipo family car. InCzechoslovakia, technicians from Manifattura Lane GaetanoMarzotto andamp; Figli S.p.A. are working to modernize thecountry's inefficient textile plants. And in Hungary, BancaCommerciale Italiana is developing a financial-services jointventure.   &quot;Italians have several unrelated advantages&quot; over otherWestern competitors, says Warren Oliver, an Eastern Europeanalyst at the London brokerage firm of UBS Phillips andamp; Drew.&quot;The small and medium enterprises in Italy are strong, makinga good partner for similar industries in the East. TheGermans are also strong in this area, but the Italians aremore export-oriented, and there is a reluctance (in EasternEurope) to stake everything on the Germans.&quot;   Eastern European businessmen agree. &quot;We know Italianindustry and the Italian market; there is a special climateof cooperation,&quot; says Janusz Nogowczyk, a seniorforeign-trade official for Poland's Fabryka SamochodowMalolitrazowych car group. Mr. Nogowczyk's company has beenproducing the small Fiat 126 car since the mid-1970s, turningout 200,000 a year.   Making the most of those opportunities won't necessarilybe easy. One potential obstacle is funding. While in the pastsome major Italian industrial projects have been paid for inhard currency, many other ventures have depended oncountertrade agreements or the direct export of goodsproduced. Such deals are relatively easy for large privatecompanies or state-backed enterprises but they are a headachefor smaller businesses.   One sector where Italy traditionally has been aparticularly strong exporter, and where companies are bravingthe obstacles to seize the advantage in Eastern Europe, isthe clothing and textiles business. Among the competitors isStefanel S.p.A., which three years ago opened a boutique inBratislava, Czechoslovakia, to sell women's fashions forlocal currency.   &quot;We've been doing good business here,&quot; says a storeassistant, gesturing at the steady stream of customers. Thereare gaps on many shelves, a sign of the difficulty ofmatching supply with demand. A Stefanel spokesman explainsthat deliveries are limited by a quota system set up underthe former Communist authorities, but he expects the problemto be resolved soon. Stefanel recently opened alocal-currency shop in Budapest, the first of 10 stores ithopes to launch in Hungary by the year end. The shops will beoperated on a franchise basis by Tradex, a private Hungariancompany.   Rival Benetton Group S.p.A. also has stepped up itspresence. The company has 10 hard-currency outlets in Hungaryand smaller networks in Czechoslovakia, East Germany andPoland, and it is looking to produce clothes in the SovietUnion through a joint venture.   And near Moscow's Red Square, two Florentine businessmenare doing a brisk business in blue jeans. &quot;We have opened afactory in the Soviet Union, and sales are doing well,&quot; saysAlessandro Fratini, who with his cousin manages the SuperRifle jeans company.   Super Rifle started selling in Czechoslovakia 25 years agoand began exporting to the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s.Now, it has invested $70 million in a Soviet joint venturethat started producing jeans locally last December.</TEXT></DOC>
