But they are beginning to feel confident about demand for shorter maturities of such issues, as illustrated by the success of yesterday's $100 million issue by Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.    The soft-drink bottler's debut in the Eurobond arena, led by Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., generated good demand, according to other banks involved.    Secondary markets provided some help for the Coca-Cola Enterprises launch. Seasoned fixed-coupon issues were up 1/4 to 1/2 point on the day, bolstered primarily by the early rise in U.S. Treasury issues.    Elsewhere, seasoned Euroyen issues also posted slight gains to recover part of the sharp losses they had Monday. However, demand was said to come mainly from banks looking for odd issues to use in later repackagings.    Equity-linked issues by Japanese borrowers came under selling pressure, reflecting declines in Japanese stock prices.    Coca-Cola Enterprises offered one of the strongest new issues of the day. It priced its 8 1/4%, three-year issue at 57 basis points over U.S. Treasury yields, about three basis points under Aegon N.V.'s 8 1/4% bonds due 1990, launched June 17. But Coca-Cola represented a more influential name, which is critical in the European markets, syndication officials said.    Elsewhere in the primary markets, several equity-linked deals by Japanese borrowers were hurt by the decline in Tokyo equities listings.    Kajima Corp., a construction engineering concern, met resistance on its launch of $200 million of five-year Eurobonds with equity-purchase warrants. The bonds, indicating a 1 3/8% coupon at par, were led by Daiwa Europe Ltd.    The story was similar for $50 million of Eurobonds with equity warrants by Nichirei Corp., a food-processing concern. Indicating a 2 7/8% coupon at par, the issue was led by Yamaichi International (Europe) Ltd. </TEXT></DOC>
