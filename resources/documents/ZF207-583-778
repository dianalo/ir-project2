Powerful translators can keepthat file formatting intact on both sides of the silicon curtain.andM;You're sending a proposal to clients in Tokyo.andP;  With all the air and seacarriers available, you have many delivery options.andP;  But your business dealwon't go anywhere unless someone translates it into Japanese.andP;  It's the samewith the Mac and PC.andP;  There are many ways to connect the two systems, but allthe wire in the world won't let MacWrite translate a WordStar file and readit.andM;Moving files between a DOS machine and a Mac is easy with an AppleTalknetwork because your Mac is already compatible with AppleTalk.andP;  For your PCto access an AppleTalk network, you need to load it with an AppleTalk board(from Apple or the TOPS Division of Sun Microsystems) and file-transfersoftware such as AppleShare, TOPS, or Farallon's Timbuktu.andP;  Or you canconnect to a PC network over a bridge.andP;  If you don't have access to anetwork, you can add an Apple or Daynat floppy-disk drive that reads DOSdisks to your Mac.andP;  Or you can connect a PC and Mac directly through theirserial ports or via a phone line.andM;But you don't want a straight ASCII transfer with strange charactersappearing where formatting should be.andP;  You want to retain the boldface,underline, margin, and other formatting information you've put into theoriginal documents, and you don't want new characters to appear.andP;  You need atranslator.andM;Translators are available that can convert files to and from most popularprogram formats on either side of the silicon curtain.andP;  Most can translate aswell as transfer files, sometimes in a single step.andP;  I tested Apple FileExchange (AFE), MacLinkPlus, LapLinkMac, and QuickShare with the differenthardware combinations that you can use to transfer and translate data.andO;Here's what I found.andM;AFE and MacLinkPlusandM;The first place to look for translation software is on the System disks thatcame with your Mac, which is where you can find Apple File Exchange, aprogram that would be worth buying if it were not free.andP;  Apple has beenincluding AFE on the System disks since October 1987.andP;  Upgrading an earlierversion of the System to a version that includes AFE costs $49.95.andM;AFE looks and acts like Font/DA Mover (see Figure 1).andP;  First choose thesource and destination disks, then highlight the file to be transferred, andfinally click on Convert and Transfer.andP;  The program can access anyfloppy-disk drive attached to the Mac and any network volume mounted on thedesktop.andM;AFE comes with two translators.andP;  One is a generic text translator thattranslates from Macintosh to MS-DOS or ProDOS (Apple II) file formats butdoes not retain formatting information.andP;  The second translates betweenMacWrite and DCA or RFT, two common DOS wordprocessor formats, keeping textformatting intact.andP;  You do, however, have to remember to save the DOS filesin either DCA or RFT format.andM;One of the great things about AFE is that it can also use DataViz'sMacLinkPlus translators, which you can buy separately from the fullMacLinkPlus/PC program.andP;  Loading these translators into AFE is a simplematter of putting them into the AFE folder and installing them on AFE'sMac-to-PC and PC-to-Mac menus with the Other Translators menu item.andP;  Withthese translators loaded into AFE, you can translate data files directly fromone program's file format to another's - directly from WordStar to MacWrite,for example.andM;The best pan of MacLinkPlus has always been its translators.andP;  It now has 75PC-to-Mac, 72 Mac-to-PC, and 15 Mac-to-Mac translators, such as Works WP toWord 3.0 and WriteNow to Works.andM;What can you do with 75 PC-toMac translators? Well, MacLinkPlus translates toand from WordStar, DisplayWrite, Microsoft Word, MultiMate, OfficeWriter(including versions 5 and 6), WordPerfect (including 4.2 on the PC and 1.0 onthe Mac), XyWrite III, and DEC's WPS-Plus/VMS word processor.andP;  And itautomatically recognizes Mac PageMaker files from versions 2 and 3 andtranslates them into the DOS version.andM;And that's just the word-processing and page-layout programs.andP;  For graphics,it converts PC .TIF files to Mac TIFF files and PC PaintBrush to PICT.andP;  Andit converts files from all the major PC databases and spreadsheets to Macdatabase and spreadsheet formats as well as to an assortment of standardformats, such as WKS, SYLK, tab-delimited, and comma-delimited.andM;AFE's simple interface and MacLinkPlus' translation power are a greatcombination.andP;  But for only $40 more, you can get the full MacLinkPlus/PC,which transfers and translates files over a modem.andP;  The program has an answermode that automatically accepts files from another Mac.andP;  It can also transferfiles serially and comes with a Mac-to-PC serial cable.andP;  The MacLinkPlusinterface is more complex than AFE's but requires only a few minutes tolearn.andP;  And, like AFE, MacLinkPlus/PC translates and transfers files in asingle step (see Figure 2).andM;Whether you are using MacLinkPlus/PC or AFE, MacLinkPlus translators simplifytranslation.andP;  No other translation package offers as many direct translatorsor retains textformatting information (boldface, italics, underlines,margins, and paragraphs) as cleanly and consistently.andM;LapLinkMacandM;Like MacLinkPlus, LapLinkMac comes with a serial cable to connect a PC to aMac.andP;  But the similarity ends there.andP;  The greatest difference between theprograms is that with LapLinkMac all translating is done on the PC.andM;LapLinkMac was originally designed to move files between PC laptop anddesktop computers.andP;  To add Mac-to-PC translation, Traveling Software wrote aserial-connect utility for the Mac and the Mac translators for the PC.andO;Unfortunately, the company did not integrate file translation and filetransfer, so they are two separate steps, leaving you with two copies of afile on your PC - the original Mac version and the translated PC version.andM;LapLinkMac is also much more limited than MacLinkPlus in the number of directtranslations it can perform.andP;  On the Mac side, it recognizes only Word andWordPerfect.andP;  (Traveling Software planned to release a new translator bySeptember that included MacWrite.) It does better on the DOS side,translating to and from DisplayWrite, Word, MultiMate, WordPerfect, WordStar,and XyWrite.andP;  This is the extent of its direct translations, however.andM;Furthermore, LapLinkMac translations are not as clean as MacLinkPlus'.andO;Remember the WordStar tab ruler, (----!----!----!----)? A WordStar-to-Wordtranslation leaves this ruler at the top of the Word document (the boldfaceand italics remain intact).andM;Going the other way, the Word-toWordStar translation adds another step: Youhave to save the Mac Word file in DOS format.andP;  If you don't, you get thecryptic error message &quot;error obtaining memory,&quot; which isn't particularlyuseful.andP;  Mac users might mistake it for a cry for more RAM from the PC.andM;One advantage of LapLinkMac is that running the translator on the PC frees upyour Mac.andP;  LapLinkMac's serial-connect utility on the Mac runs in the background under MultiFinder; MacLinkPlus and AFE do not.andP;  But even here you mustbe careful.andP;  The Mac-to-PC transfer can be interrupted if you do some routineoperations in the foreground, such as opening a DA or an application.andP;  Forinstance, when I opened a Word file on my Macintosh during a transfer, thetransfer operation stopped and had to be restarted.andM;LapLinkMac has some nice features.andP;  For example, you can view the textcontent of Mac files from your PC, although without formatting.andP;  To chooseMac files to transfer, you issue LapLinkMac's Tree command, which creates atree diagram of the folders and files on the Mac disk you've selected (seeFigure 3).andP;  You can then select a file, using the arrow keys instead oftyping the path to the filename.andP;  (The path is a list of the folders you needto open to get to the file, separated by colons.) But you don't even need touse the Tree command if you use a Mac file called Start LLMac to determinewhich Mac folder you want to open.andP;  When you doubleclick on this file, itstarts LapLinkMac, and the files in that folder appear in the LapLink programfolder on the PC.andM;LapLinkMac is not difficult for experienced DOS users to learn, but what isaccomplished with a single mouse click in MacLinkPlus requires a series ofkeyboard commands in LapLinkMac.andP;  For instance, to choose a translator withMacLinkPlus, you click on Choose Translators and then highlight the ones youwant.andP;  (AFE is even easier because it displays only those translatorspertinent to the files you're translating.)andM;To choose a translator in LapLinkMac, you have to get to the main screen,choose the Option command, choose the X-lators command, use the arrow keys toset From and To markers on word-processor types, and then quit twice to retumto the main screen.andM;Even PC users will find the X-lators screen confusing.andP;  It presents a list ofword processors with version numbers that correspond only to PC versions ofthe programs.andP;  To select the Mac versions, you have to choose the relevantprogram listing with the highest PC version number.andP;  The only exception is ifyou want to use the Mac version of Word.andP;  In this case, because of a softwarebug, you have to select version 3.0 - not the highest-numbered version, 4.0.andO;(Traveling Software planned to correct the X-lators screen problem in itssummer release.)andM;QuickShareandM;QuickShare from Compatible Systems is unique in that it connects the Mac andPC through SCSI (a card for the PC is included).andP;  This scheme works well,but, unfortunately, the software is limited.andM;Setup is easy.andP;  You plug in QuickShare's PC SCSI board, connect it toyourMac's SCSI port, and install software on both machines.andP;  Even Mac users whohave never seen a PC should be able to use the QSINST PC installationprogram.andP;  The PC with QuickShare has no problems sharing the SCSI bus andworked fine even when I had it daisy-chained with three other SCSI devices.andO;Unfortunately, the translation software is weak.andM;You do the file transfer and translation on the Mac with an applicationcalled PC Transfer.andP;  QuickShare has no specific translators as do LapLinkMacand MacLinkPlus.andP;  Instead, you get several low-level options: CopyAppropriately, Copy Byte for Byte, Copy as Text, Copy Printer Capture, andCopy MacBinary (see Figure 4).andP;  None of these options except Copy PrinterCapture retain boldface, italic, underlining, or other formattinginformation, and extra characters are often inserted into translateddocuments.andM;Copy Printer Capture mode retains some of your formatting but is a bittrickier to use than the other modes.andP;  After running the QSPC program on thePC, you use the Print command in your DOS word processor, which produces acaptured file.andP;  (You can also capture a screen shot of a text or graphicsdocument.) To translate this file to the Mac, use PC Transfer in the CopyPrinter Capture mode.andP;  Graphics become MacPaint files, and text documentsbecome MacWrite files.andP;  (This is a one-way process only.) This print-captureability is also available separately from QuickShare as the inexpensiveAnyText and AnyGraph packages.andP;  (Not surprisingly, MacLink Plus also has aprintercapture capability.)andM;In addition to giving your Mac access to your PC's files, QuickShare lets youcreate up to eight virtual disks - that is, disk space on any PC or PCnetwork that mounts on your Macintosh desktop.andP;  So if you have a largehard-disk drive on your PC, the PC and Mac can share it, saving you the costof buying one for your Mac.andP;  And since it's a SCSI connection, as with otherMae hard drives, the datatransfer rate is very good.andM;The Hard and the Soft of ItandM;All file-transfer methods are not created equal, so which software you usedepends on your method of moving files (see Table I for a comparison ofMac/PC file-translation features).andP;  The slowest way is using MacLinkPlus overa modem (between 1,200 and 19,200 bps).andP;  Still, it lets you transfer andtranslate files to and from your computer at work while you're at your cabinin the woods (as long as you have phone service).andM;MacLinkPlus and LapLinkMac offer a PC-to-Mac serial connection that transfersdata at up to 57,600 bps, but some PCs can't handle this speed.andP;  This methodisn't much better than a modem connection, and tbe two machines must bewithin ten feet of each other.andM;LocalTalk, which gets a bad rap for being slow, is a much better alternativeat 230,400 bps.andP;  AFE and all versions of MacLinkPlus can run over a LocalTalknetwork with file servers.andP;  If you're lucky enough to have Ethernet cards inyour Macs, you can theoretically move files at up to 10 Mbps.andP;  Unfortunately,LapLinkMac cannot be run over LocalTalk or Ethernet on PC networks.andO;LapLinkMac's serial connection to a Mac gives the PC access toAppleSharecompatible file servers, but this is an agonizingly slow way totransfer files.andM;A TOPS distributed file-sharing network running on a Macintosh withFlashBoxes can transfer data at 770,000 bps or at LocalTalk speeds withoutFlashBoxes.andP;  The TOPS Mac software comes with a desktop version ofMacLinkPlus (without telecommunications features), which makes it a viabletranslation solution.andP;  The installation procedure and interface are a bitcomplicated, though.andM;QuickShare's SCSI connection is a speedy method of exchanging files, with atransfer rate of up to 4.2 Mbps, depending on the Mac.andP;  It also gives youaccess to file servers on PC networks.andP;  Although your Mac won't become anode, you can access files and set up virtual disks on PC hard disks.andO;QuickShare would be an excellent alternative to serial connections if it camewith direct translators or could be used with MacLinkPlus.andM;The Floppy OptionandM;Despite all these high-tech network options, one of the easiest solutions tothe problem of exchanging files is to have a fioppy-disk drive that can readboth PC and Mac formats.andP;  LapLinkMac can use PC floppy drives that read Macdisks (see &quot;Mac Drives for PC Users&quot; sidebar).andP;  For Mac users, I looked atthree drives for the Mac that read DOS-formatted floppies - the DaynaFile,Apple's PC 5.25, and the FDHD drive built into all Mac SE/30s, IIcx's, andIIx's.andP;  Apple and PLI also make external FDHD drives, but I couldn't get themin time for this report.andM;DaynaFile is a SCSI device that runs on any Mac with a SCSI port.andP;  The drivemounts on the desktop and allows normal click-and-drag operations for copyingfiles or creating folders, which become directories in DOS.andP;  AFE andMacLinkPlus perform translations with DaynaFile.andP;  (Dayna also sells a desktopversion - minus the telecom features - of MacLinkPlus.)andM;Apple took an amazingly un-Maclike approach with its Apple PC 5.25 drive.andP;  Itcan be accessed only through AFE (tough luck for MacLinkPlus fans!) and doesnot appear on the desktop.andP;  Connection to the Macintosh requires a card forNuBus or the SE slot.andP;  Apple PC 5.25 drive's performance is similar toDaynaFile's.andM;DOS floppies in Apple's built-in 3.5-inch FDHD, like those of the Apple PC5.25, are accessible only through AFE.andP;  Fortunately, Dayna offers a utilitycalled DOS Mounter, which puts a DOS floppy icon onscreen, as a normal Macdrive does.andP;  A bug in version 2.2 of the DaynaFile driver causes someproblems with the DOS Mounter, however.andP;  Dayna will replace it with version2.3 for free.andM;John Rizzo is technical editor at MacUser.andM;The Bottom LineandM;MacLinkPlus is the most comprehensive PC-to-Mac translation softwareavailable and is still the standard.andP;  I recommend using the MacLinkPlustranslators, either purchased separately for use with AFE or in the completeMacLinkPlus/PC package, it you need telecommunications and serial abilities.andM;Both AFE and MacLinkPlus can work over AppleShare-compatible networks.andP;  Ifyou buy TOPS, you get the MacLinkPlus translators with the Mac software.andO;However, TOPS is an expensive solution if you need only a PC-to-Mactranslator and you aren't planning to set up a TOPS network.andM;QuickShare is a great way to share hard disks with one or more PCs.andP;  Butwithout direct translators, you'll spend more time cleaning up translateddocuments than you'll save on transfer time.andM;LapLinkMac is OK if you must run translation software on the PO.andP;  To raise itto the level of MacLinkPlus, LapLinkMac needs a Mac version, moretranslators, and an alternative to the slow serial connection.andM;Putting a DOS drive on your Mac is a convenient translation solution.andO;DaynaFile is a better choice than the Apple PC 5.25, since it offers similarperformance but doesn't use an expansion slot.andP;  To be ready for all DOSdisks, use the dual drive with both 5.25- and 3.5-inch formats.andP;  The builtinFDHD drives on 68030 Macs work well for reading 3.5-inch DOS disks, but useDayna's DOS Mounter utility to make them more Mac-like,andM;Given all these options, the bottom line is that you can forget your worriesabout Mac-PC compatibility.andP;  Whatever business programs you're using, there'sprobably a PC-to-Mac translator for you.andP;  Most likely, it's MacLinkPlus.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
