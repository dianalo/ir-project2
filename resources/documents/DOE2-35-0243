Then the data set used to characterize and test thedetection techniques is described and the features that discriminateseismic signals effectively from the background noise are characterized.Two automatic detection methods are investigated: 1) The AR (8)-Spectralestimates of the signal and noise are used to develop the AR(p)-Spectralestimate for a synthetic waveform; and 2) Several non-parametric testsare employed in a time-domain detector to discriminate event signalsfrom background. The non-parametric detector chosen, RANK 2700, employsa modified rank sum test to locate the seismic event and pick its firstarrival time. Errors in the automatic first arrival picks for 152 ofthe event traces in the data set are used to analyze the performance.The second paper presents a scenario for a clandestine, decoupled nuclearexplosion in southeastern New Mexico based upon data recorded at Lajitasand other stations at regional distances from the hypothetical clandestinetest.</TEXT></DOC>
