On September 24, 1986, the respondents, the New Zealand Meat ProducersBoard, the Meat Export Development Company and the New Zealand Lamb Company,requested in accordance with 19 CFR 355.10 an administrative review ofthe order. We published the initiation on October 24, 1986 (51 FR 37770).The Department has now conducted that administrative review in accordancewith section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').  <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review  </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of Customs nomenclature. Congressis considering legislation to convert the United States to the HarmonizedSystem (``HS'') by January 1, 1988. In view of this, we will be providingboth the appropriate Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (``TSUSA'')item numbers and the appropriate HS item numbers with our product descriptionson a test basis, pending Congressional approval. As with the TSUSA, theHS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. Thewritten description remains dispositive.  We are requesting petitioners to include the appropriate HS item number(s)as well as the TSUSA item number(s) in all new petitions filed with theDepartment. A reference copy of the proposed Harmonized System scheduleis available for consultation at the Central Records Unit, Room B-099,U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW.,Washington, DC 20230. Additionally, all Customs offices have referencecopies, and petitioners may contact the Import Specialist at their localCustoms office to consult the schedule.  Imports covered by the review are shipments of lamb meat from New Zealand.Such merchandise is currently classifiable under TSUSA item number 106.3000.These products are currently classifiable under HS item numbers 0204.1000_0,0204.2220_0, 0204.2320_0, 0204.3000_0, 0204.4220_2 and 0204.4320_0. Weinvite comments from all interested parties on these HS classifications. The review covers the period June 25, 1985 through March 31, 1986 and 10programs. The New Zealand Lamb Company (``NZLC'') was the only known exporterduring the period of review.        <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG><T3>(1) Export Market Development Taxation Incentive (EMDTI) </T3>Under the EMDTI, established in the 1979 Amendment to the Income Tax Actof 1976, exporters may receive tax credits for a certain percentage oftheir export market development expenditures. Qualifying expenditures includethose incurred principally for seeking and developing new markets, retainingexisting markets, and obtaining market information. An exporter who takesadvantage of this tax credit may not deduct the qualifying expendituresas ordinary business expenses in calculating taxable income. During theperiod of review, the tax credit was 67.5 percent of the total qualifyingexpenditures, and the normal corporate tax rate in New Zealand was 45 percent.Because the program is limited to exporters, we preliminarily determinethat it confers an export bounty or grant. The NZLC claimed EMDTI tax creditsfor lamb meat exports to the United States on its tax returns filed duringthe review period. Since exporters may claim a tax credit equal to 67.5 percent of the qualifyingexpenditures but may not deduct these expenditures from income, which istaxable at 45 percent, the net benefit to the exporters is 22.5 percentof the qualifying expenditures. To calculate the benefit, we took 22.5percent of NZLC's qualifying expenditures relating to lamb meat exportsto the United States and allocated that amount over the total value oflamb meat exports to the United States during the period of review. Onthis basis, we preliminarily determine the benefit from this program tobe 3.39 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for the period of review. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 1987, the New Zealand Government increasedthe corporate tax rate to 48 percent and the tax credit to 69 percent.Consequently, the net benefit to exporters is 21 percent of qualifyingexpenditures relating to lamb meat exports. Since we verified this decreasein the differential between the rates for the tax credit and taxable incomeprior to this preliminary determination, we are taking into account thechange in the benefit from this program. Therefore, for purposes of cashdeposit of estimated countervailing duties, we preliminarily determinethe benefit from this program to be 3.19 pecent <T3>ad valorem</T3>. <T3>(2) Export Performance Taxation Incentive (EPTI) </T3>Under the EPTI, exporters were entitled to receive a tax credit based onthe f.o.b. value of qualifying goods exported under Section 156A of theIncome Tax Act of 1976. Credits are available as a deduction against incometax payable. If the tax credit exceeds the income tax payable, the taxpayerreceives the differences in cash. The rate of the tax credit depends on the predetermined value-added categoryinto which the product falls. Lamb meat falls under category D, for whichthe corresponding rate was 3.85 percent for NZLC's fiscal year ending December1985, 1.925 percent for the fiscal year ending December 1986 and zero thereafter.NZLC claimed EPTI credits on its tax returns filed for fiscal years 1985and 1986. Because this program is limited to exporters, we preliminarilydetermine that it confers an export bounty or grant. We calculated the benefit from this program on a credit-as-earned basis,using the applicable EPTI rates on exports made during the review period.<T3>See, Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain SteelWire Nails from New Zealand </T3>(52 FR 37196, October 5, 1987). BecauseNZLC's fiscal year ends in December, two different EPTI rates were applicableduring the review period. We multiplied these rates by the correspondingexport sales of lamb meat to the United States and divided that resultby the total of lamb meat exports to the United States during the periodof review. On this basis, we preliminarily determine the benefit from thisprogram to be 3.14 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for the review period. During this review, we verified that the phase-out of EPTI benefits isproceeding on the schedule set forth in sections 156A(3A)-(3B) of the IncomeTax Act. The EPTI rate earned on NZLC's exports shipped since April 1,1987 is zero. Therefore, for purposes of cash deposit of estimated countervailingduties, we preliminarily determine the benefit from this program to bezero. <T3>(3) Livestock Incentive Scheme </T3>The Livestock Incentive Scheme was introduced in 1976 and is administeredby the Rural Banking and Finance Corporation. The program was set up toencourage farmers to increase permanently their number of livestock. Underthe scheme, a farmer engaged in a stock increase program, for a minimumof one and a maximum of three years, may opt for one of two incentives:(1) An interest-free suspensory loan of NZ$12 for each additional stockunit carried, or (2) a deduction of NZ$24 from taxable income for eachadditional stock unit carried. If the livestock increase was met, farmerswho elected to take out loans wrote the loans off as tax-free grants. Forfarmers electing the tax option, the provisional tax deduction could beapplied toward tax liability in any of the three after completion of thedevelopment program. Because benefits under this program are available only to farmers withlivestock herds, we preliminarily determine that it is limited to a specificenterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries, and thereforeconfers a bounty or grant.To calculate the benefit received from the loan option portion of the program,we treated the loan amounts forgiven as grants and allocated those benefitsover five years, the average useful life of breeding stock. The discountrate chosen was the average interest rate on overdrafts between March 1985and March 1986. For the loans that have not yet been forgiven, we treatedthe loan amounts as one-year, interest-free loans and measured the benefitusing the interest rate described above as our benchmark. The benefit fromthe tax option was determined by multiplying the amount of the tax deductionused during the review period by the corporate tax rate. We added the valueof the benefits from the loan and tax portions of the program and multipliedthe result by a factor determined at verification to represent the valueof lamb as a percentage of total sheep production. We then divided thatresult by the total value of lamb products sold during the review period.On this basis, we preliminarily determine the benefit from this programto be 1.36 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for the period of review. (4) Meat Producers Board Price Support Scheme The Meat Producers Board Price Support Scheme was established to insulatemeat producers from fluctuations in market prices and to guarantee thema minimum return on export sales of their products. The scheme is administeredby the Meat Producers Board (``the Board'') and the Meat Export PricesCommittee. It is financed through the Meat Income Stabilization Account(``MISA''), an overdraft account maintained by the Board at the ReserveBank of New Zealand. The Board has four primary sources of funds: (1) A levy set by the Boardand collected by processors from lamb, sheep, and cattle growers at thetime of slaughter; (2) return on investments; (3) short-term borrowingsfrom commercial lenders in New Zealand and overseas; and (4) advances fromthe Meat Industry Reserve Account (``MIRA''). However, during the reviewperiod, disbursements from the MISA account were funded by advances fromthe government's MIRA account. The Board has two methods for supporting the price of meat if the marketprice falls below the schedule price: (1) The Board purchases meat at theschedule price; or (2) the farmer sells lamb meat at the market price andthen receives a deficiency payment equal to the difference between themarket price and the schedule price. In both cases, the funds used to supportthe price are drawn from the MISA. We would not consider minimum price support payments funded completelyby producer levies to constitute a bounty or grant within the meaning ofthe countervailing duty law. However, this program operates to guaranteeproducers a minimum return on export sales and provides government fundsto the Board on terms that are not available from commercial sources. Therefore,we preliminarily determine that the portion of the payments representedby government funds confers an export bounty or grant within the meaningof the countervailing duty law. We calculated the benefit from this program by dividing the value of thegovernment's contributions to the MISA account attributable to lamb meatduring the period of review by the total value of lamb exported. On thisbasis, we preliminarily determine the benefit from this program to be 13.49percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> during the period of review. During verification, we found that the Meat Producers Board Price SupportScheme was terminated effective March 30, 1987. Therefore, for purposesof cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties, we preliminarily determinethe benefit from this program to be zero. (5) Supplementary Minimum Prices Scheme (SMP) The SMP was established to augment the support payments provided underthe Meat Producers Board Price Support Scheme. Each year the governmentestablished a supplementary minimum price support level that was set abovethe Board's schedule price. If the market price fell below the Board'sschedule price, payments were then made through both the price supportscheme and the SMP scheme. In September 1984, the SMP was terminated and replaced with a lump-sumpayment estimated to equal the value of payments that would have been providedunder the SMP. The government guaranteed an interim lump-sum payment forone year after termination of the SMP. In July 1985, the Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries provided an additional and final payment under the lump-sumscheme for the remainder of the 1984/85 season. Because price support paymentsprovided under the lump-sum scheme were direct government payments limitedto exporters, we preliminarily determine that they conferred an exportbounty or grant. To calculate the benefit from this program, we allocated the portion ofthe lump-sum payment attributable to lamb meat exports for the period June25, 1985 through September 30, 1985 and divided that amount by the totalvalue of lamb meat exported during the period of review. On this basis,we preliminarily determine the benefit from this program to be 3.33 percent<T3>ad valorem</T3> during the period of review. During verification we found that the SMP scheme was terminated in September1984, and that the lump-sum scheme was terminated in September 1985. Therefore,for purposes of cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties, we preliminarilydetermine the benefit from this program to be zero. (6) Other Programs We also examined the following programs and preliminarily determine thatlamb meat exporters did not use them: (a) Export Programme Grant Scheme. (b) Export Programme Suspensory Loan Scheme. (c) Export Suspensory Loan Scheme. (d) Regional Development Investigation Grants Scheme. (e) Regional Development Suspensory Loan Scheme. <ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of Review </ITAG>As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the total bountyor grant to be 24.71 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for the period June 25, 1985 through March 31, 1986.Section 707 of the Tariff Act provides that the difference between thedeposit of an estimated countervailing duty and the final assessed dutyunder a countervailing duty order shall be disregarded to the extent thatthe estimated duty is less than the final assessed duty and refunded tothe extent that the estimated duty is higher than the final assessed duty,for merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption beforethe date of publication of a final affirmative countervailing duty determination,which is this case was September 17, 1985 (50 FR 37708). Therefore, the Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to assesscountervailing duties of NZ$0.25/lb. on all shipments of this merchandiseentered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after June25, 1985 and before September 17, 1985 and to assess countervailing dutiesof 24.71 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments of this merchandiseentered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after September17, 1985 and exported on or before March 31, 1986. Because of the termination of the EPTI, the Meat Producers Board PriceSupport Scheme and the SMP and changes to the EMDTI program, the Departmentintends to instruct the Customs Service to collect a cash deposit of estimatedcountervailing duties of 4.55 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on allshipments of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, forconsumption on or after the date of publication of the final results ofthis review. This deposit requirement will remain in effect until publicationof the final results of the next administrative review. Interested parties may submit written comments on these preliminary resultswithin 30 days of the date of publication of this notice, and may requestdisclosure and/or a hearing within 7 days of the date of publication. Anyhearing, if requested, will be held 30 days from the date of publicationor the next workday following. Any request for an administrative protectiveorder must be made no later than five days after the date of publication.The Department will publish the final results of this administrative reviewincluding the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such writtencomments or at a hearing. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 355.10. <ITAG tagnum="6">Joseph A.
