Later Thursday, in a speech in Reno, Nev., Bentsen criticizedReagan administration drug-fighting efforts. He also planned tovisit Los Angeles and Amarillo, Texas, on his first solo campaigntrip since being nominated last week in Atlanta.   The United Food and Commercial Workers convention gave a noisywelcome to Bentsen in San Francisco. Many of the 3,500 members inthe audience were wearing ``I Like Mike'' T-shirts and wavingunion-prepared signs for presidential nominee Michael Dukakis andBentsen.   Earlier this year, the union was credited by lawmakers withhelping with compromise language in legislation that barred mostpolygraph tests of job applicants by private businesses.Administration officials had opposed the separate versions passedby the House and Senate, but President Reagan signed the compromisefinal version last spring.   The congressional Office of Technology Assessment has estimatedthat about 2 million polygraph tests are given each year, most ofthem by private businesses.   Four years ago, Reagan received nearly half the votes of thetraditionally Democratic members of the union, said spokesman AlZack. But he released a poll _ taken prior to last week'sDemocratic National Convention _ showing the 1.1 million-memberunion was 2-to-1 in favor of the Democrats this year.   ``Those union members who were hoodwinked by Ronald Reagan arecoming home, in droves,'' said UFCW President William H. Wynn.   The convention was to hear from Dukakis later by satellitetelevision hookup. After that, Wynn scheduled action on aresolution putting his union on record in favor of the ticket andrequesting the parent AFL-CIO to make a formal endorsement.   Bentsen made the most of his Senate record before the crowd,citing this year's fights with the Reagan administration over thetrade bill and the sixty-days notice for plant closings.   The Texas senator said administration officials have ``draggedtheir feet for eight years'' when action was needed to helpAmerican industry compete. ``Their indifference has cost Americamore than a million manufacturing jobs and caused trade deficitsthat will cripple growth,'' Bentsen said.   ``Sure, the Reagan-Bush administration occasionally paysattention to working men and women in America _ like when they wantto put 2 million of them on polygraph machines,'' he said.   He said the Reagan-Bush record for women and minorities amountedto a ``speed bump on the path to equality in America.''   Later, in Reno, Bentsen blasted the Reagan administration for``chaos that exists in drug control.''   He told the National Conference of State Legislators that ``ourwar against drugs lacks a commander.'' He said a Bentsen-Dukakisadministration would appoint a single drug czar to oversee thebattle.   Bentsen said Dukakis' experience in state government gave him anaffinity with local officials, and he said the Democratic WhiteHouse would recognize the costs to state government when thefederal government cuts back on its programs.</TEXT></DOC>
