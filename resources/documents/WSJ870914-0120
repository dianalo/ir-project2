This fall, like many previous, promises to have the usual share of half-baked plots and half-witted dialogue. But for the networks, this season is an especially strange, unsettling time -- a kind of Twilight Zone in the TV business -- as the old measuring system (Nielsen's weekly logs) is replaced with peoplemeters (the new push-button system). Since peoplemeters are predicted to be substantially less generous, all the networks are running scared. What happens next is anyone's guess.    In general, this year's trends are: a little less comedy, a little more drama. Beyond the typical assortment of canned laughs and saccharine situations, there's a small piece of encouraging news -- the development of hybrid programming, half-hour comedy/dramas such as NBC's &quot;Beverly Hills Buntz&quot; and ABC's &quot;Hooperman.&quot; Both of these crime shows have an ironic edge, and both, coincidentally, are off-shoots of &quot;Hill Street Blues.&quot;    In &quot;Buntz,&quot; two &quot;Hill Street&quot; vets, Dennis Franz and Peter Jurasik, star as a detective and a con man. They're a couple of appealingly unlikely heroes -- balding, overweight, middle-aged, sloppy. Created by Jeffrey Lewis and David Milch, lead writers on &quot;Blues,&quot; &quot;Buntz&quot; delivers some offbeat surprises in its dialogue -- as when a neighbor accuses Jurasik of ripping off tomatoes from her window box: &quot;Who you peddling that story to,&quot; he shoots back, &quot;Ronzoni fairy-tale theater?&quot; As the neighbor leaves, Jurasik turns to Franz: &quot;How was I to know she was a control freak, counting every little last vegetable?&quot;    ABC's &quot;Hooperman&quot; comes from Steven Bochco and Terry Louise Fisher, creators of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; and &quot;L.A. Law.&quot; With that kind of pedigree, this San Francisco cop show should be an immediate hit, but right now &quot;Hooperman&quot; is more potential than fulfilled promise. It uses the same police-room setting and the same techniques of overlapping stories as &quot;Blues,&quot; without as much success. The appealingly disheveled presence of star John Ritter (&quot;Three's Company&quot;), however, may make the difference.    At first glance, the two new shows most worth watching (and about 50% of the programming is new this year) are &quot;Private Eye&quot; and &quot;Tour of Duty.&quot; Neither of these programs is a sure-fire hit, and frankly, neither may make it to renewal, but I'm rooting for them.    &quot;Private Eye&quot; (NBC), from Anthony Yerkovich (co-creator of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;), is a slick detective thriller with a high-style concept: Hard-bitten private investigator prowls the streets of L.A. in 1956, the beginning of the rock 'n' roll era.    While the plotting is sometimes a little disjointed, and the story lines a little hard to follow, &quot;Private Eye&quot; has great texture: the cool muted '50s horns on the soundtrack, the cool camera work shot through smoky haze, the Cadillac convertibles and neon signs (Mocambo, Brown Derby). This is &quot;Miami Vice,&quot; 30 years earlier -- not so much because of the obvious overlap (crime meets rock music) but because Mr. Yerkovich creates an entire sight-and-sound package in both, a total atmosphere.    Although &quot;Private Eye&quot; does tread some of the same turf already staked out by &quot;Crime Story,&quot; this new program has a distinctive &quot;film noir&quot; look -- the unshaven detective, the seedy Los Angeles streets of &quot;Chinatown,&quot; of Raymond Chandler. And it has two attractive leads: Michael Woods as Cleary, the tough, silent ex-cop with slicked-back hair and a cigarette drooping out of his mouth, and Josh Brolin as Betts, the back-alley rocker, the leather tough with the pompadour.    The writers on this show sometimes go a little crazy, but they're obviously having fun writing '50s dialogue: &quot;How'd you know that DJ was an amphetamine hype with a payola bankroll?&quot; Betts asks Cleary. &quot;He's a 10-grand-a-year record spinner with a DeSoto convertible, record-promoter playmates, and pupils the size of caraway seeds -- it fills in the blanks.&quot; This should add up to one cool show.    &quot;Tour of Duty&quot; (CBS), on the other hand, is hot all the way -- maybe too hot. It's a Vietnam War series, a weekly &quot;Platoon.&quot; From slit throats to brutal firefights to slo-mo napalm devastation, it's one intense hour. &quot;Tour of Duty&quot; is my pick long shot -- well-written, powerful, and exceedingly realistic -- but the key question remains: Will people want to tune in at 8 each week to have their noses rubbed in the Vietnam War? I'm afraid that the only hope for this show is if the teen-age Rambos and the older war-movie freaks get behind it.    The opening shots of &quot;Tour of Duty&quot; -- the gritty debris, the faces of the wounded, the maimed, the hopeless -- make it clear that this is no idealistic portrayal of war. &quot;Tour of Duty's&quot; re-creation of 1967 Vietnam is detailed and unrelenting. From a mud-soaked tackle volleyball game played by overeager recruits, to the sweating, bowel-clenching nervousness of attackers on the crawl, the scenes are realistic.    The dialogue, frequently shocking, rings true: &quot;Lock and load,&quot; yells the sergeant. &quot;You niggers never seen a spic before,&quot; sneers a feisty young recruit. &quot;He went home in a plastic bag,&quot; mutters one soldier. Even the moral trauma of a would-be conscientious objector, forced to make his first kill, is on-target. Terence Knox as the sergeant and a crew of newcomers as his platoon create a solid ensemble cast of soldiers serving out their 12-month stay in hell.    From start to finish, this show is painfully depressing, and depressingly real, in a way that television almost never is -- and for that reason I bet it gets pulled almost immediately. </TEXT></DOC>
