On other markets, energy futures were mixed to marginally higherafter three straight sessions of strong rallies; gold and silverfutures dipped, but platinum rose; and livestock and pork futuresedged lower.   Sugar settled 10 cents to 51 cents higher on the New York Coffee,Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, with the contract for delivery in May at12.59 cents a pound.   Buying began with a rumor that the Chinese had bought between150,000 and 500,000 tons of raw sugar from Thailand, though manytraders cast doubts that the shipment exceeded 350,000 tons.   Many others traders said they believed the Chinese actuallybought the sugar last fall from Cuba and, learning the Soviets hadmade a similar-sized purchase from Thailand, simply swappedshipments to take advantage of economies in delivery of the sugar.   Also fueling the market was talk the Brazilians had sold 100,000tons and that Argentina was in the market for a large shipment.   The climbing prices triggered a string of technical buy-stops _decisions made by price-chart considerations _ and the market brokea ``quadruple top'' at 12.38 cents and continued rising.   Energy futures, which hit a 16-month high Monday and soared againin successive sessions, were mixed. Crude oil highlighted thecomplex, losing 5 cents at the opening on profit-taking, andrecovering gradually in light trading.   Crude oil settled 2 cents lower to 9 cents higher on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, with April at $19.84 a barrel; heating oil was.02 cent to .36 cent lower, with April at 53.83 cents a gallon; andunleaded gasoline was .50 cent lower to .12 cent higher, with Aprilat 55.83 cents a gallon.   Reports of cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC producers, as well asproblems with production facilities in Norway and Qatar had fueledprevious rallies.   Gold and silver continued sliding in the face of a firm dollarand uncertainty about whether higher inflation is in the offing.   Platinum got a boost from apparent trade-house buying promptedeither by ideas the market was oversold or by recent sales by theJapanese.   Gold settled $2.30 to $2.90 lower at the New York CommodityExchange, with March at $389.80 a troy ounce; silver slipped 3.2cents to 4.7 cents, with March at $6.059 a troy ounce. Platinum was$7.20 to $7.70 higher, with April at $545.50 a troy ounce.   Livestock and pork futures mostly were lower on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange. Volume was light as traders, many expecting abearish tone, remained on the sideline in advance of the USDA'scattle-on-feedlot report issued after the close.   Live cattle were .37 cent lower to .02 cent higher, with April at77.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent to .35 cent higher,with March at 80.60 cents a pound; live hogs were .50 cent lower to.10 cent higher, with April at 43.17 cents a pound; and frozen porkbellies were .05 cent to 1 cent lower; with March at 37.15 cents apound.
