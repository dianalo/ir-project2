The Saudis have long supported their fellow Arabs in Iraq, but in recent weeks reports have circulated that they are selling refined products, such as kerosene and gasoline, to Iran. Some Arabs see that as a sign of appeasement toward the Islamic regime in Tehran.    &quot;If Iran gets products from the Saudis I am sure it's not the government involved, but the private sector or third parties,&quot; Iraqi Oil Minister Qasim Ahmad al-Uraybi said in an interview yesterday.    Iraq's success in striking Iranian oil installations has caused shortages of kerosene and gasoline in Iran and forced the nation to import 200,000 barrels a day of refined products. In an intensifying war of cities and economic targets, Iran for the second day in a row fired a missile at Baghdad, apparently aimed at the city's Dora refinery. But the missile reportedly missed.    Saudi arms merchant Adnan Khashoggi's involvement in the U.S.'s secret arms sales to Iran has raised many questions in the Middle East about a possible role by the Saudi regime in the U.S.-Israeli overture to Iran.    Because the Saudis are a critical source of aid to a number of moderate Arab governments, no Arab official is willing to speak on the record. But many privately say they believe the House of Saud was at least aware of the U.S. arms sales, and had hoped the U.S. effort would somehow tame Iran's desire to export its Islamic revolution to neighboring states.    Officials in moderate Arab countries predict Saudi Arabia will now increase aid to Iraq to assuage any Iraqi doubters who suspect the Saudis of playing both sides of the conflict. &quot;It's the Saudi way to hedge their bets,&quot; said a moderate Arab official from another country. &quot;But if they get caught, they'll pay more to the Iraqis.&quot;    In separate interviews, however, both Oil Minister al-Uraybi and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said the Saudi kingdom is, so far, simply continuing its usual aid. Mr. al-Uraybi said Saudi Arabia and Kuwait continue to provide Baghdad the income from the equivalent of 300,000 barrels of oil a day. The assistance is a major subsidy for Iraq's war effort.    Mr. al-Uraybi added that Iraq expects to conclude soon a new contract with its two Persian Gulf neighbors to continue that arrangement for another year. The practice began in 1983, after oil-price declines forced the Saudis and Kuwaitis to stop direct cash assistance. The cash aid totaled an estimated $21 billion in the first three years of Iraq's war with Iran.    The oil minister predicted crude prices would hold this year at around $18 a barrel, which would allow both Iran and Iraq more money for the war. He said Iraq is prepared to reduce production if necessary -- and if all other producers do -- to keep prices in the $17 or $18 range. &quot;But we will insist on the same production quota as Iran,&quot; he said. &quot;We won't take cuts unless Iran does.&quot;    Regardless of quotas, Iraq intends to increase its capacity to export this year and it is determined, at the same time, to reduce Iran's oil exports. &quot;Our number one goal is to cut Iran's oil exports,&quot; said Taha Yassin Ramadan, Iraq's first deputy prime minister, in an interview earlier this week.    Oil Minister al-Uraybi said yesterday that Iraq expects to boost its oil exports another 500,000 barrels a day in June, when work is completed on the expansion of an oil pipeline through Turkey. That pipeline, he said, currently carries one million barrels a day. He also said Iraq expects to sign by March a contract for further expansion of a pipeline through Saudi Arabia that would raise exports through that nation to 1.6 million barrels a day in two years from 500,000 barrels a day now. </TEXT></DOC>
