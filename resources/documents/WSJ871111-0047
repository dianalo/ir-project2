Pete Domenici sees deficit-reduction as a leap over a political precipice. And, at the moment, the New Mexico Republican says, &quot;Nobody wants to jump first.&quot;    Both political parties have cherished positions. The Republicans are the party of no taxes. The Democrats are the protectors of the average guy and his Social Security pension. In the continuing White House-Congress negotiations, the willingness of each side to compromise its own position will mean the difference between a substantial budget compromise and a tepid and transparent one.    &quot;Each party has set a trap for the other,&quot; says Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.). &quot;We (Republicans) have the Democrats on taxes. The Democrats have us on Social Security.&quot;    But, says Rep. Pat Williams (D., Mont.), &quot;If they (the Republicans) take taxes and we take entitlements (such as Social Security), we'll get a great big package, bigger than anyone anticipates.&quot;    Both sides are struggling just to construct a package that has close to the minimum amount of deficit-reduction necessary to avert triggering the automatic, across-the-board budget cuts on Nov. 20 under the Gramm-Rudman law. Recent proposals by Republicans and Democrats have tended to contain in the range of $25 billion to $30 billion in deficit-reductions in the current fiscal year.    But the key to devising a more substantive package is the willingness of each party to give up its political chit so an accord can include a sizable revenue component and a proposal to limit cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits. Rep. Williams thinks such a plan is possible if, somehow, it is &quot;immaculately conceived . . . with everyone claiming to sire it.&quot;    Negotiators are increasingly confident that they will reach a pact prior to the Nov. 20 deadline. But the persistently sluggish pace of the talks, now more than two weeks old, reflects the ever-present political struggle.    At the wrap-up of one recent budget meeting, for example, the two sides seemed to be moving close to agreement. Treasury Secretary James Baker said the president was inclined to agree to higher taxes, and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) said the Democrats would accept bigger cuts in social programs.    But then, Sen. Bennett Johnston threw a wrench into the gears. The Louisiana Democrat leaned across the table and told Mr. Baker that the Democrats weren't inclined to accept Republican wishes to cut domestic programs without some compensating tax increases on high-income people. &quot;We want to soak the wealthy,&quot; he said, according to others who were in the room.    To a similar suggestion earlier in the talks, Secretary Baker said that if the Democrats wanted to carry out Sen. Johnston's idea by tampering with the income-tax rates, &quot;You would have to impeach the president.&quot;    The Democrats are demanding that any sacrifices by low-income and middle-income people be balanced with tax increases on the wealthy and cuts in military spending. The Republicans are hoping to save their cherished military buildup, and keep tax increases to a minimum.    The plodding progress is complicated by entrenched positions by leaders of both parties. During a recent meeting with Republican leaders of Congress, President Reagan exclaimed that he wouldn't be pushed around by the Democrats. &quot;Damn it, I'm mad,&quot; he said. &quot;I will not accept a tax (rate) increase.&quot;    House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) is equally disdainful of the president's position. Even as talks with the White House continued, Rep. Wright embarked on an ill-fated attempt to devise his own, separate deficit-reduction package, and discounted the need for the president's participation. &quot;I've never seen it produce anything,&quot; he told reporters.    The goal of the high-level talks, spawned by the stock market drop Oct. 19, is to find enough deficit-reducing measures to avert a $23 billion across-the-board budget cut that is scheduled to take effect Nov. 20.    In purely numerical terms, the two sides are close to meeting that target.    There is general agreement that annually appropriated programs should be allowed to grow very little, if at all, from fiscal 1987 levels. The most discussed version of a &quot;freeze&quot; of this kind would yield at least $6 billion in savings, and probably more. In entitlement programs, such as Medicare and farm subsidies, the Democrats have proposed reductions of about $4 billion. The Republicans' latest offer on a tax increase is $8 billion -- involving increased tax-law enforcement and other changes that wouldn't raise rates -- and there is an indication they could go to $10 billion. The two sides, therefore, easily can agree on a package of about $18 billion.    Both sides clearly want to close the gap -- and soon. The talks, which were begun with an urgency that is rare in Washington, are driven by a fear that failure could cause another setback for the shaky financial markets. Blame for such a calamity would be spread widely. &quot;If these negotiations don't succeed,&quot; Sen. Bentsen warns. &quot;The blame will be attracted to all parties.&quot;    Lawmakers and Reagan administration officials acknowledge that, as a result of the stock-market plunge, the chance for a budget agreement now is better than it has been in several years. &quot;If they lose this opportunity,&quot; says Rep. Edgar Jenkins (D., Ga.), &quot;it may not come back quickly.&quot;    But even if the negotiators come up with a plan, it well could face a difficult road to passage in Congress. House Republicans and Senate Republicans, for example, have a sharp disagreement over taxes and Social Security. The House GOP members resist raising any taxes and curtailing Social Security; Senate Republicans are taking the lead in pushing President Reagan to accept both.    Likewise, the Democrats are at odds on a variety of issues. Foremost among them are territorial matters in Congress. Chairmen of the Appropriations Committees, for example, are resisting reopening for further cutting the bills they labored to complete this year. Likewise, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee is reluctant to undo the hard work it took his committee to draft and then pass on the House floor his more than $12 billion tax-increase bill.    The measure squeaked through by a floor vote of 206-205 after a last-minute vote switch, and Speaker Wright's acceptance of the switch still has House Republicans fuming. He also managed to alienate members of his own party from the left and the right.    Whatever the negotiators might agree to is likely to face critical receptions in both houses, says Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) &quot;You can't slam dunk anything.&quot;    ---       Components of Recent Deficit-Reduction Plans         (In billions of dollars for fiscal 1988)                             Republican      Democratic    Tax increase                 $8.0            $12.0    Military cut                  4.9              5.4    Nonmilitary cut*              4.1              2.4    Entitlement savings**         5.1              4.2   *Appropriated accounts   **Social Security not included   Source: Congressional officials</TEXT></DOC>
