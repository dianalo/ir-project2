The cafeteria was packed with students, who hugged each otherand renewed friendships. Others jammed the campus post office,checking their accumulated mail.   Mawlawi said the campus was hit several times by artillery fire,causing ``extensive damage ...that has now been repaired.''   ``Everything's in place. The faculty and students are here,'' hesaid. Syrian troops and Lebanese police in red berets checkedstudent ID cards at the three gates of the tree-lined campusoverlooking the Mediterranean in Moslem west Beirut.   ``Beirut's life is throbbing again now that the university hasreopened,'' said a policeman who strolled through the campus.   It was not known how many of the 5,000 students returned onMonday. Ghada Sheib, a Shiite Moslem architecture student, said:``I'm very happy to be back. Let's hope it'll last.''   Many students and other residents of Beirut share her doubtsabout the durability of a cease-fire that began Sept. 22. Thetruce, arranged by the Arab League, stopped an artillery war thatbegan March 8 between the Christian army units of Gen. Michel Aounand a Moslem alliance led by Syrian soldiers.   More than 900 people were killed and nearly 3,000 wounded in theartillery battles, among the most savage of the civil war.   Closure of the university, founded 123 years ago by Protestantmissionary Daniel Bliss of New England, made it impossible forstudents to take examinations.   ``I hope this semester won't be interrupted, because I have tobegin my master's degree next semester,'' said Ghada Kahtan, 27, anagricultural student.   Ms. Khatan, a Sunni Moslem, has endured many interruptions inher education because of the war, in which more than 150,000Lebanese have been killed. ``I hope I'll graduate this time,'' shesaid. ``Let's hope this cease-fire's genuine.''   Marleen de Tavernier, a 29-year-old Belgian doctor studyingpublic health, said: ``I've been waiting for this day. I only needtwo more months to finish my master's.''   The reopening coincided with resumption of classes at scores ofschools that were forced to close because of the shelling.Education officials estimated 800,000 children university studentsand returned to school Monday.   American Univerersity of Beirut has produced at least threeLebanese presidents, 10 prime ministers, more than 100 Cabinetministers and ambassadors, and several guerrilla leaders. It ischartered under the laws of New York state.   The 400-bed university hospital, Lebanon's largest, stayed openthrough the fighting. Its doctors and interns treated about about80 percent of the casualties in west Beirut, often working whileshells from Christian artillery exploded around the building.   Terrorism swept the university after the civil war began in1975. President David Dodge, a grandson of Bliss, the founder, waskidnapped on the campus in 1982 and freed a year later.   A gunman killed another president, Malcolm Kerr, outside hisoffice on Jan. 18, 1984. Several U.S. and British staff memberswere abducted.   Frederic P. Herter, an American who now is president, has notset foot on campus since taking up the post in March 1987 becauseof a U.S. government ban on travel to Lebanon.   Herter, 68, presided over a meeting of trustees in Amman,Jordan, last week and said he hoped the U.S. government eventuallywould restore the $6 million a year formerly provided to theuniversity.   Ibrahim Salti, a Jordanian who is acting president, now runs theAmerican University of Beirut. He said the war had driven awaynearly all foreign teachers, once 30 percent of the faculty, andreduced non-Lebanese to about 10 percent of the student body.</TEXT></DOC>
