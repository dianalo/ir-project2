The state will retain 200 major factories and the railway,public transport, aviation, mining, power, postal andtelecommunications sectors.   The decision to set up a market economy with substantialprivate ownership, after seven decades of socialism, resultedfrom last year's political upheaval in the Central Asiannation. The ruling Communist Party held free elections inAugust that produced a multiparty government, though stilldominated by Communists.   The first privatization step is scheduled for late thismonth, when shops and service firms will be auctioned off.Larger concerns will issue stock starting in August orSeptember. The process could take more than a year.                                                                                                          EUROPEANS TARGET THEIR HERITAGE                                                                                                          The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe endeda nine-day meeting in Poland by pledging to seek new ways toprotect the Continent's cultural heritage and promisingspecial help for Eastern Europe. Representatives from 34countries said measures could include creation of data banksand research networks to track sources and effects of airpollution on monuments and buildings. The forum agreed toimprove and coordinate training for craftsmen and restorers,and to protect historic sites from damage resulting fromtourism.                                                                                                          TAIWAN'S FOREIGN INVESTMENT                                                                                                          Taiwan's foreign investment in this year's first fivemonths more than doubled to $943.6 million from $456.4million a year earlier, focusing on basic metals, the servicesector, banking and insurance, electronics, and paperproducts. Foreign investment in Taiwan edged up 1.5% to$836.8 million, of which 48% came from the U.S., offsettingdeclines by Japan and European nations.                                                                                                          PEMEX TO CUT LEAD IN GASOLINE                                                                                                          In an effort to reduce pollution in Mexico City, thegovernment oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, saidit would cut the lead content of regular gasoline nearly inhalf and supply low-sulfur fuel oil to industry. The gas willconform to European Community lead standards. The 2.5 millioncars in Mexico City are 10 years old, on average, and theirreplacement by new vehicles that use unleaded gas is expectedto be slow. By 1993, all new vehicles sold in Mexico musthave anti-pollution gear.                                                                                                          SAUDIS SEEK LONG-TERM INVESTORS   Saudi Arabia is placing high priority on developing theprivate sector and attracting long-term foreign investment, asenior state official, Prince Abdullah bin Faisal bin Turkial-Saud, said in London. He said foreign companies previouslysought only government contracts, rather than joint ventureswith Saudi private-sector companies, where he cited&quot;incredible opportunities.&quot;                                                                                                          BRITAIN TO LEAD EMISSIONS STUDY                                                                                                          British Coal, the government-owned coal producer, is tohead a three-year research project, on behalf of theInternational Energy Agency, aimed at reducing carbon dioxideand other greenhouse gases emitted by fossil-fuel powerplants. The study, among other things, will examine storingcarbon dioxide in disused oil and natural gas wells and underthe ocean, and to determine the effects on power productioncosts.                                                                                                          EUROPEAN AUTO MAKERS ASSAILED                                                                                                          Toyota Motor Corp.'s European chief, Junji Numata, saidthat in seeking a quota agreement on Japanese cars, Europeanauto makers are thinking too small about the market'spotential.   Mr. Numata acknowledged a rising protectionist trend inEurope and the U.S., but said: &quot;We live in a borderlessworld, whether you like it or not. You can't build a fortressFrance, or a fortress Europe.&quot; He said European auto makers,which have persuaded the European Community Commission toseek an accord limiting sales in Europe by Japanese automakers, &quot;shouldn't be so pessimistic about the Europeanmarket -- it will be the biggest market in the world.&quot;   Mr. Numata also outlined Toyota's plans for expandingsales in Europe and the Soviet Union by one-third to about600,000 cars and trucks annually over the next six or sevenyears. He said the company's long-term aim is to producelocally at least half the vehicles it sells in the Europeanmarket.   Toyota estimates the total European market, including thenewly opened eastern economies, could grow 2% to 3% a yearthrough this decade. That means Western European car salesalone could expand 23% to about 16 million a year by 2000.Mr. Numata said auto makers ought to concentrate on becomingmore efficient, improving car safety and solving autos'environmental problems.

Jamaican-born Bill Morris was elected Britain's firstblack labor union leader. Mr. Morris, 52 years old, willbecome general-secretary of the 1.2 million-member Transportand General Workers Union, the country's largest, next March.. . .
