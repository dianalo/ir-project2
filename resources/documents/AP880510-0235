Manuel Antonio Noriega met withhis Florida lawyers Tuesday to discuss strategy in seekingdismissal of U.S. indictments that charge him with drug trafficking.   Noriega engaged lawyers Raymond Takiff, Frank Rubino and SteveKollin after the indictments were handed up in February. Takiff andRubino flew to Panama Monday night.   After the meeting, Rubino described Noriega as ``veryencouraged'' by developments in the case and ``very confident''about having weathered U.S. pressure to oust him. ``At the momentthere are no plans for his retirement,'' Rubino said.   The United States is trying to force Noriega to resign ascommander of Panama's military and police, the position from whichhe controls the civilian government.   Washington has applied several types of economic pressure sinceNoriega dismissed President Eric Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 26, theday after Delvalle tried to fire the general.   According to Noriega, the Reagan administration wants him outbecause of his opposition to what he calls efforts in the UnitedStates to retain control of the Panama Canal.   Under the 1977 canal treaties, the United States must relinquishcontrol of the canal by midnight Dec. 31, 1999.   Noriega won his first legal battle last month when Judge WilliamHooveler ruled he did not have to appear in a Florida court forhearings on his challenge of the indictments.   Rubino said the lawyers spent ``quite a few hours'' with Noriegaon Tuesday, ``told him the good news of our recent court victoryand discussed our plan of action.''   He said he and his colleagues will appear in court in ``about amonth'' to request dismissal of the indictments.   Officials initially said the third lawyer, Kollin, was also inPanama for the meeting. They later said he was not.</TEXT></DOC>
