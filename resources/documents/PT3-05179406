The photosensitive      material, which has been subjected to a printing procedure, is      sequentially immersed into each of the treating tanks and, after being      developed, it is introduced to a drying unit where it is dried prior to      being withdrawn. </PAR><PAR>  Since the treating solution is withdrawn by conveying the photosensitive      material and is also decreased due to evaporation loss, it is necessary to      replenish the loss as the throughput of the photosensitive material is      increased. Incidentally, the amount of solution withdrawn by this      photosensitive material can be readily calculated from the throughput of      the photosensitive material. Meanwhile, as regards the above-described      decrease of the treating solution due to evaporation loss, since the water      content within the treating solution is decreased, the concentration of      the treating solution is changed. Therefore, it is necessary to add an      amount of water corresponding to the loss independently of the      replenishing solution. However, the evaporation loss cannot be definably      determined by calculation because it varies with the surrounding      environment, such as temperature and humidity, and further depending on      whether the apparatus is in an operating or shut down condition. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, it is proposed to provide a level sensor, such as a gravimeter      or the like, within each treating tank and add water based on a value,      detected by this level sensor (see, for example, Japanese Patent      Application Laid-Open No. 1-281446), according to which the changing      concentration of the treating solution can be detected by the level sensor      so that an appropriate amount of water can be added. </PAR><PAR>  Nevertheless, the operating reliability of the level sensor is low and it      often operates erroneously, often making the addition of an inappropriate      amount of water possible. This is also true of the concentration sensor.      In addition, these sensors are costly and lack serviceability. As a      result, it is proposed to provide a monitoring treating tank that is      independent of the actual treating tank and add water therein based on the      evaporation loss of the latter (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open      Nos. 1-254959 and 1-254960). Accordingly, operating reliability is      increased because data approximating the actual evaporation loss can be      obtained. </PAR><PAR>  However, in the above-described water adding system, since the monitoring      treating tank is independent of the actual treating tank, the entire      apparatus becomes bulky and the number of parts required increase. In      addition, in order to set similar conditions as in the actual treating      tank, management and maintenance become complicated. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In view of the above-described circumstances, an object of the present      invention is to provide an apparatus for treating photosensitive material      and a method of adding water for use therein, which will eliminate a unit      for detecting evaporation loss from the apparatus itself and which      supplies a reliable and proper amount of water while improving      manageability and maintainability. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention concerns a method of adding water into the treating      tank of the apparatus for treating photosensitive material comprising the      steps of: </PAR><PAR>  determining, as a replenishing solution is being added to the treating      tank, whether an overflow of the solution occurs or not; and </PAR><PAR>  supplying a predetermined amount of water into the treating tank as the      overflow is not detected. </PAR><PAR>  According to the above-described arrangement of the present invention,      since the detected overflow means that the treating solution within the      treating tank has been filled by a predefined amount, it is not necessary      to supply more water. Meanwhile, if the replenishing solution is properly      added and the level of the treating solution is not deficient, since this      shortage corresponds to evaporation loss, water may be added until it      overflows. Also in this case, if the treating solution which has overflown      from the treating tank is detected by a flowrate meter or the like, that      is, it is determined whether the water has overflown or not. Water may      then be added without excess or shortage. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, the present invention comprises the steps of: </PAR><PAR>  previously setting an amount of water to be added to the treating tank,      which corresponds to the overflow of the treating solution from the      treating tank; </PAR><PAR>  integrating an overflow of the treating solution from the treating tank; </PAR><PAR>  evaluating an amount of water to be supplied to the treating tank from the      integrated overflow; and </PAR><PAR>  supplying the same amount of water as the evaluated amount of water to be      supplied into the treating tank. </PAR><PAR>  With changing environmental conditions, for example, the temperature or      humidity of the air surrounding the apparatus, the strength of the air      conditioning wind passing therethrough, and the extent of ventilation of      the upper part of the treatment tank positioned inside the apparatus,      evaporation loss of water within the treating tank is changed and the      overflow is also correspondingly changed. Therefore, as also described      below, the overflow of the treating solution from the treating tank may be      integrated to evaluate the amount of water to be supplied to the treating      tank from this integrated value, by which, as compared with supplying the      predetermined amount of water, a more appropriate amount of water may be      supplied. </PAR><PAR>  A relationship between the integrated overflow value and the amount of      water to be supplied is hereinafter described. First, as shown in FIG. 6A,      when the photosensitive material is continuously treated under normal      conditions, since the replenishing solution corresponding to the      throughput of the photosensitive material is supplied, an overflow      corresponding to the replenished amount takes place. However, as indicated      by a chain line in FIG. 6A, if, due to changing environmental conditions,      the evaporation loss of water within the treating tank increase or if the      predefined amount of the replenishing solution is not supplied, overflow      does not take place. Since the concentration of the treating solution is      also correspondingly changed, the amount of water to be added must be      increased. In addition, as shown in FIG. 6B, when the photosensitive      material is intermittently treated, since the evaporation loss of water      within the treating tank takes place while the photosensitive material is      not being treated, overflow may not take place during treatment. Since the      concentration of the treating solution also changes, the amount of water      to be added must be correspondingly increased. Therefore, the overflow of      the treating solution in a predetermined period of time may be integrated      and the concentration of the treating solution can be held constant by      setting the amount of the solution to be added so that, the less the      integrated overflow is, the more solution is added. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6C shows three kinds of overflow each corresponding to the absence of      overflow when there is throughput for the day when there is a large amount      of overflow observed when the throughput for the day is great and a small      amount of overflow observed when the throughput for the day is small. </PAR><PAR>  Still further, the present invention relates to an apparatus for treating      the photosensitive material comprising a treating tank for accommodating      the treating solution for treating the photosensitive material, an      overflow tank for accommodating the overflow of the treating solution      accommodated within the tank, a delivery means for delivering the overflow      of the treating solution toward the overflow tank and a detecting means      disposed inside of the delivery means for detecting either the presence or      absence or the flowrate of the treating solution which passes through the      interior of the delivery means. </PAR><PAR>  According to the above-described arrangement of the invention, excess      treating solution accommodated within the treating tank is delivered into      the overflow tank through an overflow line. Since a flowrate meter is      provided within the overflow line, it is possible to detect the presence      or absence and the flowrate of the treating solution flowing out toward      the overflow tank. Since the detected overflow means that the treating      solution within the treating tank has been filled in the predefined      amount, it is possible to determine if the level of the treating solution      within the treating tank reached the predefined value. As a result, it      becomes unnecessary to detect the surface level of the treating solution      by the mechanical motion of the float or the like within the treating tank      to thereby achieve an improvement in accuracy of detecting the surface      level. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, when the solution is properly replenished and the surface      level of the treating solution is not sufficient, this shortage      corresponds to evaporation loss, so that water may be added until it      overflows. Also in this case, if the treating solution which has overflown      out of the treating tank is detected by a flowrate meter or the like, that      is, it is determined whether it has overflown or not, it is possible to      add the correct amount of treating solution. We can use any flow rate      meter or overflow detect device as a flow rate meter or the like. For      example, rotor type, honneycum type, thermosensor type, magnetic liquid      type and so on. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to an apparatus for treating photosensitive      material comprising: </PAR><PAR>  a treating tank for accommodating the treating solution which treats the      photosensitive material; </PAR><PAR>  a sensor means for detecting whether the treating solution has overflown      out of the treating tank or not; </PAR><PAR>  a determining means for determining based on the above-described results      detected by the sensor means whether the overflow was detected or not over      a predetermined period of time; and </PAR><PAR>  a supply means for supplying a predefined amount of water into the treating      tank when it has been determined that, over the predefined period of time,      the overflow could not be detected by the determining means. </PAR><PAR>  According to the above-described arrangement of the invention, if it is      determined by the determining means that the overflow was not detected      over the predefined period of time by the sensor means, then it means that      the surface level of the treating solution is deficient due to the      evaporation loss of water within the treating tank. So a predetermined      amount of water is supplied to the treating tank means of the supply      means. Also in this case, if the sensor means detects that overflow took      place, then the proper amount of water may be added. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, the present invention relates to an apparatus for treating the      photosensitive material comprising a treating tank for accommodating the      treating solution that treats the photosensitive material, an      accommodating means for previously accommodating an amount of water to be      supplied which corresponds to the overflow of the treating solution out of      the treating tank, an integrating means for integrating the overflow of      the treating solution which has overflown out of the treating tank, a      measuring means for evaluating the period of time which has passed after      the adding of water is completed, a determining means for determining      whether the time that has passed which was evaluated by the measuring      means, added up to a predetermined time or not, a calculating means for      evaluating an amount of water to be supplied, which corresponds to the      overflow integrated by the integrating means, based on the content      accommodated within the accommodating means, as was determined by the      determining means that the predetermined that the period of time had      passed and a supply means for supplying the same amount of water as the      amount evaluated by the calculating means to the treating tank. </PAR><PAR>  According to the above-described arrangement of the invention, since with      changing environmental conditions surrounding the apparatus, the      evaporation loss of water within the treating tank is changed and overflow      is also correspondingly changed, the overflow out of the treating tank may      be integrated over a predetermined period of time by the integrating means      starting from the moment that the supply of water has been completed to      evaluate the amount of water to be supplied from data on the amount of      water to be supplied, which correspond to the overflow out of the treating      tank, which was previously accommodated within the accommodating means, by      the calculating means to supply the water by means of the supply means, so      that, as compared with a case in which a predetermined amount of water is      supplied to the treating tank, a more appropriate amount of water may be      supplied. </PAR><PAR>  As described above, the apparatus and the method of adding water      implemented in that apparatus according to the present invention have some      advantages in that a highly reliable and correct amount of water can be      obtained without providing equipment for detecting the evaporation loss in      the apparatus itself while its manageability and maintainability can be      improved. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating an automatic      developing machine embodying the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a schematic view of an overflow tank which is provided adjacent      to a treating tank; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3A is a flowchart illustrating a control routine according to the      present embodiment for controlling the operation; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3B is a flowchart illustrating a routine according to the present      embodiment for determining whether water should be added or not; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4A is a map illustrating a relationship between the integrated      flowrate and the inferred evaporation loss of water according to an      modified embodiment of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4B is a flowchart illustrating a routine according to a modified      embodiment of the present invention for determining whether water should      be added or not; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5A and 5B are respectively a schematic view illustrating how an      overflow line according to an modified embodiment of the present invention      is mounted; and </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 6A to 6C are respectively characteristic views illustrating overflow      corresponding to the treating conditions. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  In FIG. 1, an automatic developing machine, which acts as the apparatus      according to the present invention, is shown, in which a developing tank      12, a bleaching tank 14, a bleaching/fixing tank 16, a fixing tank 18,      rinsing tanks 22, 24 and a stabilizing tank 26 are each disposed in series      each accommodating a developing solution, a bleaching solution, a      bleaching/fixing solution, a rinsing solution and a stabilizing solution      therein in a predefined amount. A photosensitive material F is      sequentially fed into these treating tanks (hereinafter generally referred      to merely as the treating tank (10) by means of a feeding system (not      shown). This feeding system is controlled by a control unit 78, to which      is connected a signal line of a sensor 76 provided at the inlet of the      developing tank for detecting the passage of photosensitive material F so      that the control unit 78 may detect whether the photosensitive material F      is present or not. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 1, disposed adjacent to the treating tank 10 is a water      tank 36, which is in communication with the bleaching tank 14 via a line      34. Interposed at an intermediate portion of the line 34 is a pump 32      driven and controlled by the control unit 78 so that by driving the pump      32 water is supplied to the bleaching tank 14. In addition, disposed      adjacent to the water tank 36 is a replenishing water tank 44, which is in      communication with the bleaching tank 14 via a line 42. Interposed at an      intermediate portion of this line 42 is a pump 38 driven and controlled by      the control unit 78, so that, as in the above-described water supplying,      the replenished bleaching solution may be added to the bleaching tank 14      by driving the pump 38. </PAR><PAR>  Incidentally, a branch line 35 is provided upstream from the pump 32 and      communicates with line 34 for replenishing water to the bleaching tank 14.      This branch line 35 extends toward the developing tank 12. Interposed at      an intermediate portion of the branch line 35 is a pump 33 driven and      controlled by the control unit 78, so that the driving of the pump 33      causes water to be supplied into the developing tank 12. </PAR><PAR>  Respectively provided at the developing tank 12, the fixing tank 18 and the      stabilizing tank 26, which are treating tanks other than the      above-described bleaching tank 14, are lines 56, 58 and 62 for supplying      the replenished treating solution. In addition, disposed at the rinsing      tank 24 is a water supply line 64 to replenish rinsing water. From the      rinsing tank 24 the rinsing water is fed to the rinsing tank 22 by means      of an overflow 66 while, from the fixing tank 18, the fixing solution is      fed to the bleaching/fixing tank 16 by means of an overflow 67. The      rinsing water within the rinsing tank 22 is fed toward the fixing tank 18      by means of a pump 72 and a line 73. Incidentally, the driving of this      pump 72 is also controlled by the above-described control unit 78. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 2, an overflow tank 146 is provided adjacent to each      treating tank 10. Erected between the overflow tank 146 and the treating      tank 10 is a vertical wall 148 to partition the treating tank 10 and the      overflow tank 146. The height of the vertical wall 148 is set lower than a      lateral wall 50 of the treating tank 10. The treating solution within the      treating tank 10 flows out toward the overflow tank 146 over this vertical      wall 148. At this overflow tank 146, a throttle portion 146A for      collecting the treating solution which has overflown and serves as an      overflow line, is formed. A flowmeter 52 is disposed thereto. This      flowmeter 52 is disposed along the stream of flow of the treating solution      from the overflow tank 146. The flowmeter 52 is connected to the control      unit 78. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 1, the control unit 78 includes a microcomputer 80, which      comprises a CPU 82, a RAM 84, a ROM 86, an I/O port 88 and buses 90 for      connecting them to data buses control buses or the like. The      above-described pumps 32, 33, 38, 46 and 72 are respectively connected to      the I/O port 88 via drivers 32A, 33A, 38A, 46A and 72A. Also connected to      this I/O port 88 are the sensor 76 and the flowmeter 52. Still further, a      signal line 92 is connected to this I/O port 88 for transmitting a signal      to the feeding system. </PAR><PAR>  Within RAM 84 of the microcomputer 80, flowrates detected by the flowmeter      52 are calculated for storage and, over a predetermined period of time      after the addition of water is completed, its integrated flowrate is read      out to infer the amount of water to be added. In this embodiment, when the      integrated flowrate equals zero over the predetermined period of time, a      predetermined amount of water may be added. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, stored within ROM 86 of the microcomputer 80 is a program for      replenishing the replenishing water and a water adding program, as shown      in FIGS. 3A and 3B. The replenishing water program and the water adding      program may be alternately processed for each predetermined period of time      while the apparatus is operating. Only the water adding program is      executed while the apparatus is shut down. Alternatively, these programs      may be concurrently processed using two CPUs. </PAR><PAR>  Next, the operation of this embodiment will be described with reference to      the control flowcharts of FIGS. 3A and 3B. </PAR><PAR>  The photosensitive material F is sequentially introduced from the      developing tank 12 through the bleaching tank 14 to the bleaching/fixing      tank 16, where treatments such as developing and bleaching and the like      are conducted and, after being withdrawn from the stabilizing tank 26, it      is dried. </PAR><PAR>  First, the control routine for the operating time as shown in FIG. 3A is      referred to. In step 100, it is determined whether the apparatus is      currently operating or not. If yes, the procedure moves to step 102 where      it is determined whether a flag F is set (1) or not. This flag F is one      for discriminating whether water should be added or not (described later).      In step 102, if it is determined in the affirmative, that is, it is      determined that water should be added, then the procedure moves to step      104 where a value from RAM 84 is fetched for adding predetermined amount      of water (45 ml according to experimental example 1 which will be later      described) and then, in step 106, the same amount of water corresponding      to that value is added by actuating the pump. </PAR><PAR>  In the next step 108, after the flag F is reset (0), the procedure moves to      step 110. In this case, if in step 100 or step 102, if it was determined      in the negative, that is, it was determined that the time period for      adding water was not due or that there was no need to add water, then the      procedure moves directly to step 110. </PAR><PAR>  In step 110, it is determined whether or not it is time to add solution,      and when the throughput of the photosensitive material F amounts to 50      rolls, in terms of the negative film, it is determined that the solution      adding time is due and the program moves to step 112 where data on the      predetermined amount of the solution to be replenished is fetched from RAM      84 and then, after an amount of the solution corresponding to the former      is replenished in step 114, the procedure proceeds to step 102. On the      contrary, if it was determined that the time is not due, then the      procedure skips steps 112 and 114 and moves to step 102. </PAR><PAR>  The above-described is the control performed while the apparatus is      operating and, in this embodiment, independently from this control      routine, irrespective of the operating time or shutdown time, the routine      for determining whether water should be added or not, as shown in FIG. 3B,      is in effect. This routine is hereinafter described in detail. </PAR><PAR>  In step 200, it is determined whether the flag F is reset or not. If not,      since it has already been determined that there is the need to add water,      step 200 is repeated until water adding in the control routine is      completed. If, in step 200, the answer is determined yes, then the      procedure shifts to step 202 where the timer is reset and started. The      routine then moves step 204. In step 204, the flowmeter 52 determines      whether overflow was detected or not. If yes, that is, if overflow was      detected, it is not necessary to add water since the treating solution      within the treating tank 10 is sufficiently filled. The procedure moves to      step 202 so as to set and start the timer again. </PAR><PAR>  If, in step 204, the answer is determined no, that is, if overflow was not      detected, the procedure moves to step 206 where it is determined whether a      predetermined period of time (6 hours according to the experimental      example 1, which will be later described) has passed. If no, the procedure      shifts to step 204 and thereafter repeats steps 204 and 206 until the      predetermined period of time passes. </PAR><PAR>  If, in step 206, it is determined that the predetermined period of time has      passed, then the procedure shifts to step 208 where the flag F indicating      that there is need to add water is set (1). The procedure then moves to      step 200. Consequently, this flag F is supposed to be set when overflow      does not occur past the predetermined period of time. </PAR><PAR>  As described above, irrespective of the operating time or shutdown time,      evaporation loss can be handled (i.e., solution can be replenished) not      only at the initial period of the shutdown time when the temperature of      the treating solution is high and much water evaporates, but also when      evaporation is generated due to standard operation of the apparatus by      detecting the presence or absence of the overflow, to thereby hold the      concentration of the treating solution approximately constant. As a      result, a stable developing treatment can be achieved. </PAR><PAR>  In this case, by way of example 1, the flowmeter 52 of this embodiment is      attached to the overflow tank 46 of the developing tank 12 and, when no      overflow is observed over 6 hours, 45 ml of water is added. As a result,      GL tone turns out retained within a standard range (andplus;0.3) and a stable      development is achieved. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, by way of another example 2, the flowmeter 52 according to the      present embodiment, which is different from the apparatus of the      embodiment, was attached to an overflow tank 46 which is used as a color      paper treating tank paper for P2 (desilverizing treatment) and PS1      (rinsing treatment). When overflow was not observed for 4 hours at the      time of adjusting the temperature, water of 13 ml was added to P2 and 30      ml to PS1. At this time, neither stain nor flaw took place. </PAR><PAR>  Although, in this embodiment, the integrated flowrate of the flowmeter was      0 over a predetermined period of time, a predetermined amount of water was      added but, alternatively, based on a previously stored map (FIG. 4A)      representing the relationship between the integrated flowrate and the      inferred evaporation loss of water, an inferred evaporation loss of water      (amount of water to be added) may be calculated and water adding may be      controlled based on this calculated value. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 4A, since the amount of the solution to be replenished is      decided relative to the throughput of the photosensitive material,      overflow of the treating solution out of the treating tank, which      corresponds to the replenished amount, is decided. However, this overflow      may vary with environmental conditions. If evaporation loss is decreased,      then overflow is increased while if evaporation loss is increased, then      overflow is decreased resulting in a change in the concentration of the      treating solution. Consequently, in order to hold the concentration of the      treating solution constant, when evaporation loss is decreased, the amount      of water to be added is decreased. In other words, when overflow is      increased, the amount of water added is decreased while, if evaporation      loss is increased, then the amount of water added is increased. That is,      if overflow is decreased, the amount of water added may be increased.      Consequently, the map of FIG. 4A is set so that, with increasing      integrated flowrate, the inferred evaporation loss, that is, the amount of      water added is decreased. In addition, when the integrated flowrate      exceeds the predetermined value, since it is not necessary to add water,      the inferred evaporation loss is set to zero. </PAR><PAR>  How to control the addition of water is hereinafter described with      reference to a flowchart of FIG. 4B. For the same control of FIG. 4B as in      FIG. 3B, a sign A is affixed to the tailing end of the same number and its      description is omitted. In addition, the description of the control      routine for controlling the operating conditions is omitted because it is      the same as in FIG. 3A. If, in step 202A, the timer is reset and started,      the procedure is moved to step 250 where the flowrate detected by the      flowmeter 52 is integrated for storing into RAM 84. If, in step 206A, the      predetermined period of time did not pass since water adding was      completed, then step 250 is repeated. If the predetermined period of time      has passed, the procedure moves to step 252 to read the stored integrated      flowrate. Subsequently, in step 254, an evaporation loss of water (amount      of water added) based on the integrated flowrate is inferred from the map      shown in FIG. 4A. The procedure then moves to step 256. In step 256, if      the inferred amount of evaporated water loss is zero, it means that it is      not necessary to add water. The procedure then shifts to step 200A where,      if it is necessary to add water, the procedure moves to step 208A where,      after the flag F is set (1), the procedure moves to step 200A. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with the above-described sequence, since an integrated      flowrate (overflow) integrated over the predetermined period of time is      known and, in particular, since it is possible to infer evaporation loss      from the overflow at the operating time, a more precise amount of water to      be added can be evaluated. </PAR><PAR>  Incidentally, although, in this embodiment, the throttle portion 146A is      formed within the overflow tank 146 as the overflow line, as shown in FIG.      5A, either one of the open-ended portions of the overflow line 53 may be      connected to the lateral wall 50 of the treating tank 10 while the      overflow tank 146 may be disposed so as to correspond to the other      open-ended portion thereof. In this case, the flowmeter 52 is disposed at      the intermediate portion of the overflow line 53. In addition, as shown in      FIG. 5B, one end of the overflow line 53 may be passed through the bottom      surface of the treating tank 10 so as to protrude above the liquid surface     . </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
