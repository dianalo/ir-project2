About 50 of the circles, with diameters of 10 to 100 feet, showup every summer usually in fields of long grass, barley, oats orwheat near hills, said tornado expert Terence Meaden.   Speaking at a conference in Oxford, he dismissed speculation thecircles were caused by flying saucers, helicopters flying upsidedown, supernatural beings or even herds of rotating hedgehogs, asmall porcupine.   ``Wind usually blows round both sides of a hill and mergessmoothly round the other side,'' Meaden said. ``However, sometimesthere is a gust on one side but not the other which creates vorticesor sudden whirlwinds. These sink to the ground and flatten crops ina spiral.''   Meaden said the Tornado and Storm Research Organization atBradford in northern England, where he works, investigated 150 cropcircles over the past eight years.</TEXT></DOC>
