The gene discovery is expected to lead to better diagnosisand, perhaps, the first effective therapy for the relativelycommon, inherited disorder. Scientists who found theso-called NF gene also said it may play a surprisingly broadrole in the development and inheritance of several commontypes of cancer.</LP><TEXT>   The scientists speculate that the NF gene may be part ofrecently identified class of genes that, when defective, canunleash a cancer. Molecular biologists chasing after thesegenes believe a cancer develops after a cell accumulates anumber of these mutated &quot;tumor suppressor&quot; genes, eitherthrough inheritance or some type of damage to a person'sgenetic material.   &quot;The NF discovery seems to provide a bit of the molecularpathway that transforms normal tissue to tumor tissue,&quot; saidRay White, a molecular biologist at University of Utah wholed one of two research teams that simultaneously reportedfinding the NF gene. &quot;With each discovery the picture of howa cancer occurs at the most basic level becomes more clear.&quot;   Finding the NF gene culminates a race involving a handfulof major research institutions over more than five years,part of the world-wide hunt by biologists, geneticists, anddoctors to map the entire human genome, the collection of all50,000 to 100,000 genes that direct the moment-to-momentfunctions of human life.   Mr. White's group in Utah, along with researchers at theNational Cancer Institute, reported their findings in thecurrent issue of the scientific journal Cell. At the sametime, Francis Collins and colleagues at the University ofMichigan and Washington University School of Medicine,reported finding the gene, by using different techniques, inthis week's issue of Science magazine.   Both Messrs. White and Collins said they believed the NFgene signals cells to produce a protein that controls someaspect of cell growth. The disease causes numerous problems,they said, because the gene is active in cells in numerousorgans.   The scientists said they believed further work will showthat the disorder erupts in tissues only when both copies ofthe gene -- each cell contains a gene passed on from eachparent -- becomes damaged. Thus, people who inherit analready-defective gene from one parent are particularlysusceptible to the disease. If the second copy of the geneinherited from the other parent is somehow damaged, cellsnormally under control can grow into a tumor or behave insome aberrant fashion.   &quot;For years doctors have been puzzled by the fact thatpeople with NF have a 50% higher rate of cancer, such ascancer of the colon, prostate and breast,&quot; said Mr. Collins.&quot;Now we think we know why.&quot; Mr. Collins said he will nowsearch for the protein produced by the gene and look for waysto repair or reintroduce healthy versions of the protein astherapy for those with the ailment. The protein also may behelpful in treating cancer, he said.   Neurofibromatosis, in rare instances, can cause terriblydisfiguring tumors on the face and upper body, a conditionthat has led people to erroneously call the disorder theElephant Man's disease.</TEXT></DOC>
