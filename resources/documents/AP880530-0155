(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For the 11th day in a row, weather Mondayforced a delay of a test burn of a Pershing II rocket motor, andnow the Army is bumping up against a Tuesday deadline for the testbecause of the newly ratified treaty with the Soviet Union,officials said.   The burn, originally scheduled for May 20, was delayed againMonday when winds gusted to 50 mph out of the southeast at thePueblo Army Depot, about 15 miles from Pueblo.   Spokesman Mary Wilson said the test was rescheduled for Tuesdaymorning, if weather permits. If the test is not conducted by the 5p.m. deadline, it will not be able to be scheduled for at least 30days.   The test burn would be the first step toward determining thesuitability of using the Pueblo Army Depot as a site for destroyingthe Army's 420 Pershing missile fleet as a condition of the newIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.   Tuesday is the last day the test can be conducted before theUnited States and the Soviet Union formally exchange the documentsof the INF treaty Wednesday at the summit meeting in Moscow. Thetreaty was ratified by the Senate last week.   ``Then it becomes governed by the treaty,'' Wilson said. ``If wewere to test fire it, it is then treated as an eliminination (of aweapon) under the treaty and subject to inspection by the Sovietinspectors.''   ``They'd have to witness it. ... We have to give them 30 days'notice for an elimination inspection,'' she said.   Army and Colorado Department of Health officials have set up 50collection stations on and off the Army depot grounds to collectthe chemical fallout from the rocket burning to determine if any ofthe pollutants would be harmful.   In order to keep pollution problems to a minimum, the Army isallowed to conduct a test burn only if there are winds aloftgreater than 8 mph blowing from the west, relative humidity under70 percent and a cloud ceiling greater than 5,000 feet. There alsomust be a mixing between the layers of the atmosphere, and the testmust be done by late afternoon.   The health department is requiring the test before the Army candesignate the depot for the $9 million program. Wilson said becausethe Army stores and maintains Pershings at Pueblo, the installationis the preferred site for demolishing them, but three otherinstallations also are being considered for the project that wouldcreate as many as 120 jobs.</TEXT></DOC>
