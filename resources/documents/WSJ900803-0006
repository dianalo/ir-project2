But the Conference Board, which compiles the advertisingindex, said it was optimistic that help-wanted advertisingwill pick up in the second half as the labor market improves.</LP><TEXT>   The help-wanted index fell to 133 from May's 134 and froma year-earlier 147. The index, a seasonally adjustedindicator of hiring plans, uses 1967 as a base of 100.   The independent business research group said it projects asustained growth of at least 2% in the gross national productin the second half, which is expected to boost the job growthrate, and in turn, advertising for jobs.   &quot;I'm not looking for a huge bounce back, but rather asubdued one,&quot; said Ken Goldstein, an economist with theConference Board.   Still, that's good news for job-seekers who have seenhelp-wanted ads steadily decline. The index in Octoberreached a high of 150, but now is at its lowest point since1985. The index is compiled from surveys of advertisingvolume in 51 major newspapers every month. However, theConference Board noted that 37% of the newspapers reportedrising want-ad volume, compared with a revised 22% in May and24% in June 1989.   Much of the improvement in the job market is expected tocome from growth in export-driven industries in the secondhalf, Mr. Goldstein said. &quot;And it remains a feature of thisoutlook that the turnaround is likely to show up earliest inthe Western labor markets and then sweep eastward.&quot;   The Conference Board said ad volume rose modestly in fourregions while five regions had declines. Ad volume increasedin the West South Central region, 1.7%; South Atlantic, 0.8%;New England, 0.5%; and Mountain region, 0.4%.</TEXT></DOC>
