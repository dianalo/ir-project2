Meantime, contract talks covering 3,500 workers atVancouver, British Columbia-based Cominco Ltd. continuedthrough the weekend after workers last week voted down thecompany's latest offer and authorized the union bargainingcommittee to call a strike. A union spokesman said the unionplans to continue bargaining at least until tomorrow.</LP><TEXT>   Workers at both companies are represented by localaffiliates of the United Steelworkers of America. Contractsat both companies expired Saturday.   Cominco and Brunswick Mining, 64%-owned by Toronto'sNoranda Inc., are Canada's largest and second largestproducers of zinc and lead. Prices of these metals on worldmarkets were bolstered last week in anticipation of apossible strike, and analysts expect a cutoff of zinc andlead supplies from either company could boost prices further.   Picket lines went up at the Brunswick mine near Bathurst,New Brunswick, yesterday, said Larry Urbanoski, asuperintendent at the mine. &quot;We're going through a process ofarranging an orderly shutdown of the plant,&quot; he said. As ofmidday yesterday, there weren't any new talks scheduledbetween the union and the company, he said.   Blair Doucet, president of Local 5385 of the UnitedSteelworkers, said late last week that the two sides are&quot;still quite a ways away&quot; from reaching agreement. He saidworkers rejected Brunswick Mining's offer, which includes a20% wage boost over three years and increased monthly pensionpayments, because they are determined to make up ground afterthe company &quot;got away cheap&quot; in the last round of talks.   Brunswick Mining officials couldn't be reached forcomment.   Brunswick Mining estimates its production of zinc and leadaccounts for roughly 5% and 1.5%, respectively, of Westernworld output.   Cominco produces about 5.8% of the Western world's refinedzinc, and 2.6% of the West's lead, at its big Trail, BritishColumbia, smelter complex. Cominco also owns BritishColumbia's Sullivan lead-zinc mine, where output wassuspended earlier this year due to operating losses.</TEXT></DOC>
