Genrich A. Avanesov of the Space Research Institute of the SovietAcademy of Sciences, told a space conference Tuesday that it may bein the Soviets' interest to put off the planned 1994 mission forabout two years.   ``Technically we do have the possibility to send a mission by1994 with a Martian rover, but we're not sure it's worth doing,''Avanesov said after a presentation to the conference on spaceautomation and robotics. ``It may be worth doing a more intellectualmission later.''   Asked whether funding for the mission was a problem, he said:``Money is a problem today for us, too.''   Avanesov emphasized that no official decision has been made onthe timing of the mission.   Rescheduling the mission would enable the Soviets to use findingsof a U.S. mission to Mars that is planned for 1993. On that mission,an unmanned probe called the Mars Observer is to take photographs ofMars' surface while orbiting the planet for about two years.   The Soviet mission will send a robotic rover to explore the redplanet's surface and return samples of its soil and atmosphere toEarth.   Experts in both countries have agreed that unmanned missions toprobe the surface of Mars will be necessary before a manned missioncan be launched, but it will take several years to develop thenecessary automation and robotics.   ``No research breakthroughs seem to be required, but a great dealof applied research and technology development and demonstrationwill be needed,'' Lew Allen, director of NASA's Jet PropulsionLaboratory, said in a paper presented to the conference.   A Martian rover will need to be able to avoid hazards on theplanet's surface when it lands, negotiate the terrain, preserve soiland atmospheric samples, and rendezvous with its launcher, he said.   ``We see that the rover should be an intellectual one,'' withsophisticated automation, Avanesov said. ``The question of theautonomy is a very serious one ... and should be speciallyconsidered.''   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is consideringa second unmanned mission to the planet to follow the Mars Observer,Aaron Cohen, director of NASA's Johnson Space Center, told theconference.   He said a mission could be launched in 1998 to land a roboticrover on the surface of Mars, gather samples of soil, rock andatmosphere, and return the samples to Earth in 2001.   ``The delivery and return phases ... offer many technical andengineering challenges,'' he said. ``It taxes our automationcapabilities.''   Soviet plans to explore Mars, culminating with a manned missionaround 2010 to 2015, are the top priority of Moscow's space program,Avanesov said, adding: ``We think this Mars project will give usbroad opportunity for international cooperation.''   His paper to the conference said the United States and SovietUnion could work together on certain aspects of a Mars program,including organization of a joint ground-based network of datareception, joint data interpretation, creation of a joint data bankon the Martian atmosphere and other exchanges of information.   Soviet and NASA officials have met twice this year in Washingtonto exchange information. They also are making plans to fly Americaninstruments on future Soviet missions and Soviet instruments onfuture U.S. flights.</TEXT></DOC>
