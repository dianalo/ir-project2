The promise of translation is deceptive: Itintimates that you'll get full value out of the conference by coming andlistening to a bunch of translated speeches.andP;  In fact, the formal speechesare only a small part of the event  - an introduction and a pretext.andP;  It isthe follow-through  - the talks in the halls, the sessions in the bar, etc.andO;- that will provide the real value, and only a lingua franca can make thoseopen to all.andP;  We are not holding this conference so that Bulgarians can comeand talk to other Bulgarians, but so that Czechs can talk to Americans, andGermans to Russians, and Yugoslavs to Hungarians.andM;Add to that the frequently unsatisfactory quality of the translation servicesanyway, and the decision was easy although the trade-offs are real.andM;Please note: If you would like to attend the East-West High-Tech Forum,October 21 to 24 in Budapest, please let us know.andP;  We will be mailing outapplicationl/registration forms this month; the deadline is August 30.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
