This whole scheme, which costs taxpayers and consumers billions and enriches a select few producers and distributors, is outrageous. But some places are more outrageous than others. One of them is New York.    Politicians all over the state of New York would have you know that they care about the poor. But if so, why do the poor of New York City have to pay premium prices for milk? New York, after all, is a leading dairy state and everyone knows that the whole U.S. is awash in dairy surpluses.    Milk prices in New York City run about 40 cents a gallon higher than in the suburbs of northern New Jersey, right across the Hudson River. By one estimate, they are 10% to 20% higher than any other city in the country.    The reason is simple. The state of New York, through its licensing of milk distributors for each county, runs a huge milk cartel. How it works was laid out in a recent federal district court suit brought against Joseph Gerace, state commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, by two New Jersey dairies trying to obtain full access to the New York City market.    Testimony cited government reports to show that in the Bronx, Kings, New York and Queens counties -- with a population of 6.7 million and 10,000 food stores -- the five largest state-licensed dairies controlled at least 82% of sales. New York's Agriculture and Markets law bars what it describes as &quot;destructive competition.&quot; The upshot, for all practical purposes, is no competition at all. Retailers testified that no dairy other than the one serving them ever solicits their business. Antonio Puccio, a Brooklyn store owner, testified that when he explicitly offered his patronage to a dairy other than the one serving him, he was refused.    One irony of all this is that it pits law against law. Just four years ago, the state attorney general's office secured 47 guilty pleas, and $7.2 million in criminal penalties, civil penalties and damages from 24 price-fixing milk dealers. But that didn't nullify the state marketing law.    Yet another irony is that the national taxpayers get to subsidize New York dairy surpluses that could be reduced if prices were not being propped up by the state. A Purdue University study of some years back showed that demand for milk is elastic. A 10% increase in prices cuts demand 16%. Not surprisingly, per-capita consumption of fluid milk in New York City is 15% less than the rest of the U.S. Dairy farmers might find the cartel objectionable were it not for the fact that Uncle Sam deals with their income needs.    The New Jersey dairies are charging that the refusal of New York to give them access is an interference with interstate commerce. They could have some luck with that, given past federal court decisions, if they can show unfair discrimination. Mr. Gerace is coming under heavy political pressure as well. The New York Post, run by street-smart editors with little patience for such flimflam expressions as &quot;destructive competition,&quot; has been campaigning at full tilt against Mr. Gerace. Federal Trade Commission Chairman Daniel Oliver recently presented the New York ag commission with a &quot;national consumer fleece award&quot; for depriving New York consumers of the benefits of competition.    You would think New York politicians would be embarrassed. But as we said, milk politics is intricate. Don't count on any change unless the court forces it, New York's much-vaunted compassion for the poor notwithstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
