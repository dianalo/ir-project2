Still, agradual reduction of the forces remains likely.   Talks on the bases in May, which were described asexploratory, came as the Cold War was collapsing, promptingpredictions that the U.S. wouldn't be averse to relinquishingthe bases. But more recently, the U.S. military buildup inthe Persian Gulf and an accelerating slide in the Philippineeconomy have altered the context of the talks.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts say these changing conditions have increased bothsides' interest in reaching a new agreement that wouldprovide for a gradual reduction of U.S. forces, with thepossibility that the forces would continue to use Philippinefacilities on a commercial basis.   The negotiations between panels headed by PhilippineForeign Secretary Raul Manglapus and U.S. special envoyRichard L. Armitage, a former assistant secretary of defense,are expected to begin tomorrow in Manila. The talks willfocus on time and money: how long Manila will permit U.S.forces to remain and how much Washington will pay for theprivilege.   The current agreement, signed in 1966, expires inSeptember 1991, and Manila has already given formal noticethat U.S. troops should withdraw by that date unless a newtreaty is signed. There are about 16,000 U.S. troops in thePhilippines, the third-largest U.S. military contingent inAsia after those in Japan and South Korea.   For the U.S., the Gulf crisis has highlighted theimportance of maintaining a network of foreign bases despitethe collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and sharplydiminished perceptions of a Soviet threat. &quot;It's prettyobvious that the Americans have tried to depreciate the valueof the bases in the Philippines,&quot; says Filipe Miranda, aprofessor of political science at the University of thePhilippines. Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2,however, there has been increased recognition in the U.S.&quot;that the value of the bases is quite great,&quot; he adds.   Recent massive U.S. deployments to Saudi Arabia didn'tpass through the Pacific, but moved from the East Coast.Nonetheless, U.S. bases in the Philippines are being used tosupply the Gulf forces, a role that is likely to expand ifthe Mideast standoff continues, U.S. sources say. Moregenerally, analysts say Iraq's invasion of Kuwait hasincreased awareness in both Manila and Washington of thegreater potential for regional threats to peace since the endof the Cold War.   U.S. officials say they want to retain the bases as longas possible under an agreement acceptable to both sides, butthey acknowledge that nationalist sentiment makes anindefinite U.S. military presence highly unlikely. &quot;There arelegitimate nationalist instincts,&quot; says a U.S. official. &quot;Thechallenge of the talks is to merge our interests withPhilippine nationalism.&quot;   Adds an Asian diplomat: &quot;An indefinite stay is alreadyout. The only thing to be decided is the {transition}period.&quot;   Rep. Stephen Solarz, chairman of the House Foreign AffairsSubcomittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, said a week agothat he talked with U.S. negotiators before their departurefor Manila and believed they would propose a 10-yearextension that would include a gradual U.S. phaseout.   However, a source close to the U.S. Embassy in Manila saysthe U.S. negotiating team won't offer a withdrawal, even on a10-year timetable.   For the Philippines, the Gulf crisis is only the latest ina string of natural and man-made disasters that have batteredthe economy in the past year, making it more dependent onbenefits that derive from Clark Air Base, Subic Bay NavalStation and four smaller U.S. military facilities.   Reeling from a sixth coup attempt last December, drought,typhoons, an earthquake and floods, the government ofPresident Corazon Aquino has repeatedly been forced to reduceits 1990 growth targets. Gross national product is nowofficially projected to expand 3.8% this year, well below the6% growth in output of goods and services that governmentplanners say is necessary to alleviate poverty and providejobs for a swelling population. Even so, private analysts saythe government's GNP figures are still overly optimistic.   The Mideast crisis has dealt the Philippines a doubleblow, bringing higher oil prices while cutting remittancesfrom the estimated 65,000 Filipinos who were working in Iraqand Kuwait at the time of the invasion. Workers returningfrom the Gulf will only exacerbate unemployment. Thiseconomic squeeze has fortified the arguments that thePhilippines can't afford to turn out the Americans.   Under a 1988 accord, President Ronald Reagan agreed to askCongress for a total of $962 million as payment to Manila foruse of the bases during the two years ending in September1991. Congress appropriated only $385 million for 1990, $96million short of one year's payment, and Manila andWashington are currently engaged in a dispute over thediscrepancy. Still, the U.S. payment represents a substantialcash infusion for the strapped Aquino government.   More significant for the economy are business andemployment spinoffs from the bases, which U.S. officialsestimate at about $1 billion a year, or roughly 3% ofPhilippine GNP. The bases employ 78,000 Filipinos, a payrollsecond only to that of the Philippine government.   To counter concerns about economic dependence on thebases-and perhaps to strengthen the Philippines' negotiatingposition-the government's Bases Council has proposed thatClark be converted into an international airport and cargofacility and that Subic Bay become a commercial ship-repairfacility, with the U.S. Navy as a major client.   The Bases Council has suggested that the conversion befinanced by shifting Philippine military camps from Manila toClark and selling the prime real estate they now occupy inthe capital for an estimated 50 billion pesos ($2.07billion). Even supporters of the conversion plan, however,acknowledge that it couldn't be implemented before thecurrent agreement expires next year.   Nationalist sentiment against the bases remains strong,particularly among the political elite. Analysts questionwhether any treaty providing for an extended U.S. presencecould win two-thirds endorsement from the 23-memberPhilippine Senate, as required by the country's constitution.   Philippine negotiators have refused to divulge theirobjectives in the negotiations, insisting that it is up tothe U.S. to present proposals. Economics will clearly be ontheir minds, however.   Alfredo Bengzon, the panel's vice chairman, said recentlythat the Philippine negotiators would examine U.S. proposalsfrom three perspectives: &quot;First, the aspect of what ispolitically acceptable to us. Second, from the aspect of whatis economically bearable. And third, from the aspect of whatserves the needs of both the Philippines and the UnitedStates.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
