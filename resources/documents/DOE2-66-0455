Neutron activation analysis was only rarely consideredas a possible approach; reported sensitivities were usually not verygood, unless pre-concentration was applied. In the present work, therelatively high fast neutron flux of our TRIGA reactor was used to inducethe /sup 58/Ni(n, p)/sup 58/Co reaction, and /sup 58/Co (E/sub {gamma}/=811keV) was radiochemically separated from other radionuclides by classicalanion-exchange chromatography in hydrochloric acid. /sup 57/Co was addedto the irradiated sample before decomposition as a radioisotopic yieldmonitor. By concentrating the final sample fraction and measurement ina well-type HP Ge detector, Ni concentrations down to the 10-{mu}g xkg/sup -1/ level could be determined for samples irradiated for 1 day./sup 60/Co, produced by neutron capture on /sup 59/Co, is also co-separatedand quantified from the gamma spectrum, so that both elements Ni andCo are determined. Results are reported for a series of NBS and otherbiological reference materials in the concentration range 10 {mu}g-10mg x kg/sup -1/. Possibilities for further increases in sensitivity arediscussed.</TEXT></DOC>
