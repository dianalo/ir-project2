A variety of thesecations can bind to human plasma protein molecules as shown by size exclusionchromatography. Internal Surface Reverse Phase (ISRP) HPLC has recentlybeen introduced to facilitate the reverse phase analysis of small moleculespresent in complicated biological samples. This technique is the basisfor their evaluation of the extent of human plasma protein building ofmany 99m-Tc cationic complexes such as 99m-Tc (TBIN){sub 6}{sup +} and99m-Tc (DMPE){sub 3}{sup +}, (where TBIN is tert-butyl isonitrile andDMPE is 1,2-bis(dimethyl phosphino ethane). The protein binding of 99m-Tccomplexes can be related to the speed of blood clearance of 99m-Tc radiopharmaceuticalsin myocardial imaging experiments. Thus, plasma protein binding is animportant factor to consider in designing myocardial perfusion imagingagents and other 99m-Tc radiopharmaceuticals.</TEXT></DOC>
