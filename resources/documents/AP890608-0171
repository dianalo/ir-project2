Beijing was relatively quiet Thursday after days of randomshooting, but gunfire broke out again after dark. Unrest wasreported in other cities, and provincial leaders called for harshaction against demonstrators.   Soldiers fired weapons at about 11 p.m. in the direction offoreign journalists outside the Jianguo Hotel on Changan Avenue,Beijing's main boulevard, but it was not clear whether they wereaiming at the reporters.   Hundreds of trucks in convoys moved tons of supplies intoTiananmen overnight, and hundreds more continued the resupplyoperation Thursday.   For about an hour during one delivery, commuters on bicyclesventured across Changan Avenue for the first time since Sunday, thenpolice closed it again.   Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and60,000 injured in the weekend military assault on protesters,according to a Chinese students' organization in West Germany, theUnion of Chinese Students in the Federal Republic. The governmentsays nearly 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed, but Chineseand foreign diplomats say up to 3,000 died.   Li's televised speech to soldiers in the Great Hall of thePeople, on Tiananmen Square, was his first public appearance sincethe crackdown.   ``You've done well, comrades,'' he told the cheering troopers,and admonished them to ``continue working hard to protect thecapital's safety and order.''   The hard-line premier ordered martial law May 20 after a seriesof protests in which up to 1 million people rallied in the streetsto demand an end to official profiteering and corruption and moredemocratic freedoms.   In the government's attempt to establish its own version ofevents, which includes a statement Wednesday that no one was killedin the square, television showed civilians burning military trucksand armored personnel carriers, and the charred bodies of threesoldiers, one with his stomach slit open.   Evening television also showed soldiers stooping to clear graveland debris from littered streets and others, with smiles, aidingelderly people with slight injuries.   The government declared student and labor organizers to be``important members of the counterrevolutionary turmoil,'' andordered leaders of the pro-democracy movement to give themselves up.   Radio and television urged people to turn in fellow citizens whohad engaged in ``hooliganism and destruction,'' broadcastingtelephone numbers for the convenience of informers.   Students who organized the seven-week campaign said they had goneunderground but would continue the fight for democratic rights.   ``We are prepared to drop our peaceful methods and take strongeraction against the government,'' said one who telephoned TheAssociated Press.   A student at Beijing Normal University, a center of the movement,said: ``We don't know what to do. We are waiting for orders, but ourleaders are all gone.''   Another said: ``Maybe new leaders will have to emerge. Themovement hasn't ended. Things may be calm for awhile, but the armycan't stay forever. When it goes, we students will protest again.''   Eighty tanks were stationed at Tiananmen Square, including 40 infront of the Gate of Heavenly Peace, with their guns pointed towardthe south.   Two groups of 10 tanks each faced north along Changan, flanking40 armored personnel carriers. Behind them were about 10,000soldiers in formation, jogging or standing.   It was not clear whether the soldiers were from the 27th army,which shot and bludgeoned its way through the square Saturday nightand early Sunday, or were replacement troops.   Rumors continued to circulate that the 38th army, assigned toprotect Beijing, either was replacing the 27th or already had doneso.   Speculation continued that units of other armies might attackthose supporting Li Peng.   Foreigners were leaving Beijing in large numbers, includingfamilies of diplomats.   ``It's just not a wise thing to keep people here at this point,''U.S. Ambassador James Lilley told reporters at Beijing'sinternational airport, seeing off an evacuation flight.   ``We've taken an awful lot of moves to improve our security, andthe biggest one was putting those people on that plane and pullingthem out of town.''   Protests and transportation tieups continued elsewhere in China,and provincial leaders rallied behind the central government's toughstand.   Government leaders in Shanghai, China's largest city, broadcastthat ``vast numbers of workers are unable to report to work, andindustrial production as well as the citizens' lives are beingdisrupted.'' Mayor Zhu Rongji said he could not guarantee residents'safety.   The official radio in the western city of Lanzhou reported thesituation as ``grim'' there and quoted Gansu provincial Gov. JiaZhijie as saying ``the dregs of society'' had forcibly occupied``vital communications lines and important bridges'' and stoppedtrains. Students went to factories to force workers to strike and``forcibly order factory directors to halt production.'' ``It isnecessary to form a deterrent force against them and develop asituation whereby, when a rat runs across the street, everybodycries `Kill it!''' Jia declared.   A source said soldiers were briefly called into Chengdu, capitalof Sichuan province, after days of violence. Unconfirmed reportssaid police shot and killed 20 people as crowds stormed a governmentbuilding Sunday in Chengdu.   In Beijing, soldiers still fired into the air and at somebystanders Thursday, but far less often than before.   Most residents still stayed away from their jobs, but life wasnear normal. Thousands took bicycle tours of the city, stopping togape at bullet holes in buildings and bloodstains on walls.   Stores, restaurants and some post offices reopened, and peopleformed long lines to buy the Beijing Daily and Beijing Evening News,available for the first time in five days. Both were filled witharticles denying heavy casualties among civilians and reporting thereopening of businesses.   ``There's no news,'' one reader said in disgust.   A student at Beijing Normal said: ``The calm is just superficial.With so many killed there cannot be real calm. It's just a matter oftime before the movement peaks again.''</TEXT></DOC>
