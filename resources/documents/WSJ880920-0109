At a series of international economic meetings, the Treasury secretary is expected to argue that the policies championed by his predecessor, James Baker, are succeeding, and to seek stability and calm in the world economic environment as his friend, Vice President George Bush, heads for the November election showdown with Michael Dukakis.    Despite the possible foreign initiatives, the sessions starting Saturday in Berlin aren't expected to produce any significant changes in current international accords on the dollar, economic policies, or Third World debt. Any such revisions, if they occur, would have to await the arrival of a new U.S. president in January because all would be subject to approval by Washington.    The occasion for Mr. Brady's debut is the joint annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and the separate closed gathering of the top economic officials of the Group of Seven major industrial countries.    In recent years, Mr. Baker has dominated such international economic events, exercising heavy influence on the agenda and ensuring that U.S. views tended to prevail. This time, there are signs that some other countries may try to use the leadership transition in the U.S. to advance their own agendas.    Japan, for instance, has a Third World debt plan devised by its finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa. When he last floated the idea, at the Toronto economic summit in June, it was rebuffed by Mr. Baker. U.S. officials don't expect the Miyazawa plan to be formally presented in Berlin, but it will surely be discussed informally.    News reports from Paris suggest that France may be preparing its own debt proposal for discussion in Berlin. Both the Japanese and French plans would differ from the conservative, commercially oriented &quot;Baker plan&quot; by calling for the establishment of special accounts in the IMF or a new agency to guarantee interest on refinanced Third World loans.    As previously reported, the IMF leadership itself plans to encourage discussion of the Japanese plan. The IMF leaders also will float informally separate ideas on currency coordination. These include the possibility of tying exchange rates to an IMF-controlled basket of currencies, and somehow opening the elite G-7 process for setting exchange rates to other countries through the IMF's board.    The U.S. strongly opposes these ideas, and the G-7 is expected to issue a communique that sticks to its current policy of discouraging further strong increases or decreases in the value of the dollar. Besides the U.S., the G-7 includes Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy.    Mr. Brady's job will be to fend off these proposals, and hope the meetings focus instead on the surprisingly strong world economy, the recent declines in the U.S. trade deficit, and the recent success of the G-7 in keeping the dollar relatively stable.    West German officials are expected to boast that their growth rates are likely to be more robust than predicted, despite criticism from the U.S. and others that their economy is too sluggish. But U.S. and Japanese officials are still concerned, because the German growth appears export-based, and thus may be worsening world trade imbalances.    Japan will bask in the praise of its allies for turning its export-driven economy into one that is booming from a surge in domestic consumption.    Various countries are likely to praise the reductions in the U.S. trade deficit, while reserving any hopes for progress on the budget deficit until after January. </TEXT></DOC>
