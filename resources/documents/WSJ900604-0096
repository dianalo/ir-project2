It's easyto see why.   On the left side of the desk, the in-basket totters undera load of fresh paper work. Some of it has spilled onto athree-ring binder hogging a couple of square feet ofadjoining space. It's a procedures manual; everybody has one,and nobody uses it.</LP><TEXT>   The employee's eye moves past the Rolodex (many entriesare out of order and others are illegible); the gee-whiztelephone with its advanced features that have never beenmastered; and a stack of legal pads and notebooks. Theemployee's gaze rests finally on a formless heap of paperthat has settled over the whole right-hand side of the desk.Somewhere in there are crucial warehouse inventory reportsand faxes that need responses. The remaining work space, atiny, irregular oval, is lightly dusted with paper clips,notes and a scattering of pens, some of them defunct.   ---   And the office of the future, say 10 years or so from now?Still a mess. But different. Much different.   Paper won't disappear, but there will be tons less of iton the desktop. Instead of the bulky personal computer nextto the desk, a single worker may have many computers thatwon't look -- or function -- at all like what's availablenow. And there is the prospect of an electronic organism wecan call Hydra, the office equivalent of the nine-headedmonster that Hercules slew as one of his labors.   Experts in computers and office applications are by nomeans in unanimous agreement about the exact shape of theoffice of the future. But their differences are overshadowedby general agreement on broad developmental themes.   Today's office workers have to take action to plugthemselves into the electronic-information flow. Tomorrow'sworkers will have to take action to cut themselves out of it,and their bosses might raise an eyebrow if they do.   One reason: Cellular modems will vastly expand the reachof computer communications. Right now anyone who isn'tconnected to a wire, telephone or otherwise is blissfully outof touch. With the wireless communication that cellulartechnology makes possible, it will be hard to hide.   Many experts believe that this development, and othersparalleling it, will lead to networks enmeshing people andtheir computers around the clock and around the world.&quot;You'll be reachable, no matter when it is, no matter whereyou are,&quot; says Norman Weizer, senior consultant at Arthur D.Little Inc. &quot;The problem will be how much privacy you want.&quot;Some related predictions:   -- Few computers will have on-off switches; they will beon all the time, receiving phone messages, storing electronicmail (e-mail, as it's called, will become as important as thetelephone), and nagging their principal users to reply.Moreover, workers will be equipped with locaters; theiroffice computer will be able to raise them -- on the golfcourse, at the movies, wherever and whenever. In big offices,a single human secretary manning an electronic locater boardwill be able to tell the boss where everybody is at anymoment.   -- Wherever you are, your work can be with you; the&quot;office in a briefcase&quot; will be reality. Even if they're onlygoing down the hall, executives will carry a pocket-sizedphone and often a lightweight, full-featured computer aswell. The computer will have a cellular modem, allowing it tostay in touch with its parent at the office. &quot;We're nottalking about Dick Tracy's wristwatch computer here,&quot; saysMr. Weizer. &quot;But it'll be pretty close.&quot;   For the people who love to wheel and deal on their carphones, this new world will be a dream of connectivity cometrue. For anyone who hates the very idea of being tied toeven such a simple device as a beeper, it will be anightmare.   Tomorrow's desktop will have its own special kind oflitter, if Mark Weiser is right. He is head of the computerscience laboratory at Xerox Corp.'s famed Palo Alto ResearchCenter, where many advances in computing during the 1980swere shaped. Mr. Weiser sees an office not piled with paperbut strewn with computers.   &quot;By the year 2000, the personal computer as we know itwill start to die away,&quot; he predicts. &quot;When you walk into anoffice, you won't see a recognizable computer: no monitor, noobvious keyboard. But in fact, you'll be looking at severalhundred computers. They'll be all over -- on files, indrawers, on other computers.&quot;   Some will be small but powerful &quot;notepad&quot; computers. Eachwill be dedicated to a special task or tasks, and each willbe able to recognize its user's handwriting, which will bescrawled directly on its screen surface with a stylus. Onemay be used for drafting correspondence, for example, whileanother will hold information on customers. Still others maybe &quot;scrap computers&quot; used to record an executive's randomthoughts and jottings -- even doodles -- in electronic form.   Mr. Weiser envisions even tinier machines, high-tech&quot;Post-it&quot; computers that will allow users to add theircomments, data, and even voice messages to just aboutanything in sight. Such a computer may cling to an opticaldisk that holds accounting data, for instance, giving itsuser details of seven accounts that must be modified duringthe next accounting cycle. And all these computers willcommunicate with one another via cellular linkups, so thatdocuments zip from place to place invisibly.   Most other experts, however, believe that workers 10 yearsfrom now will still depend mainly on one computer rather thanmany, and will still be typing at keyboards at least some ofthe time. But they agree with Mr. Weiser on other importantelements. Predictions:   -- Computer screens will be flat, not the bulky vacuumtubes of today. They could be hung on walls like pictures,or, more likely, be set unobtrusively into desktops.   -- Handwriting recognition will indeed flourish, as Mr.Weiser believes, and there will be some note-pad and similarcomputers in the office environment. Desktop computers mayhave a note pad as well as a keyboard. Because the technologyisn't intimidating -- it works just like a pen and paper --note-pad computers will become invaluable for secretaries,journalists, and others who deal with people.   &quot;Can you imagine sitting across from someone and tappingaway at a keyboard while they're talking?&quot; asks Jerry Kaplan,a computer pioneer whose Go Corp. is developing a note-padcomputer. &quot;This technology will break through the barriersthat computers have raised between people.&quot; The combinationof the accessible flat screen and handwriting recognitionwill induce even technophobic chief executives to make muchgreater use of computers.   -- Computers will also be able to communicate throughvoice, though the experts are split on how prevalent thiswill be. Many envision computers that accept certain voicecommands (that's possible already) and perhaps even computersthat take dictation. Pierre Hessler, director of marketingand services at International Business Machines Corp., raisesthe possibility of computers that hook into telephones andtranslate foreign languages as they are spoken.   But will users take to applications like this? Mr. Weizerof Arthur D. Little is skeptical. &quot;People don't like talkingto machines, and they don't like machines talking to them,&quot;he says.   Aside from looking different, computers in 2000 will bevastly more powerful. Most experts predict that everydaydesktop computers will pack at least the power of today'smainframes -- 100 mips, or millions of instructions persecond -- and possibly a lot more. Some of this muscle willbe directed at making computers faster, but a lot will gotoward making them far more versatile and much easier to use.Some of the things more power will bring:   -- Almost all computers will have color displays thatapproach photographic quality and are extremely intuitive --so easy to understand that someone with no training at allcould look at the screen and easily see how to get a desiredresult. Some experts, including Paul Saffo of the Institutefor the Future in Menlo Park, Calif., suggest that thecomputer will take on multiple personalities, depending onwhat the user wants it to do. Instead of calling up ascheduling program, for example, an executive may hit asingle button that summons a computer &quot;secretary,&quot; who willremind the executive of a Thursday squash game. Or theexecutive may simply touch a tiny picture, or icon, on thescreen representing a secretary.   -- Computers will be able to handle video images easily.Video capability is important for &quot;multimedia&quot; computing, themixing of data with sound and images, but it may also openthe door to video communication.   By 2000, the computer will be closely linked to thetelephone, and the two may have merged entirely. People willstill communicate by voice but improved telecommunicationstechnology (known as Integrated Service Digital Network, orISDN) will allow live pictures and lots of data to betransmitted too. These will start popping up on computerscreens. Says Franklin Reece, chairman of Boston-basedUSTeleCenters Inc.: &quot;In 10 years we're going to know people alot better. We'll be looking at each other when we talk, andwe'll have their kid's birthday and their favorite food atour fingertips.&quot;   -- With so many computers hooked together and so muchinformation flying around, data security and data integritywill be big issues. Lots of computing power will be devotedto keeping records safe from tampering: Before it allowsanyone to open a file or change a document, a computer mayask for voice identification, a thumbprint or a retina scan.   -- Computer programs using artificial intelligence willsift through the avalanche of information and present it in away tailored to the precise needs of the user. &quot;People willget a competitive edge just from the way they sort throughinformation,&quot; says computer columnist John Dvorak. &quot;Those whohave better methods will keep them secret, sharing with onlya few friends.&quot; Bond traders, for example, will jealouslyguard proprietary software that isolates the nuggets ofinformation on which they buy and sell.   Computers and telephones aren't the only machines thatwill get closer together. By 2000, most office technologywill be digital -- allowing different parts of it tocommunicate in a common language.   To many experts, this suggests an inevitable merger ofseveral machines that now operate separately because theydon't understand each other. In time, they say, we probablywon't be able to point to any office machine (except perhapsthe coffee maker) and define its purpose with a simplephrase.   Fax machines, all the rage now, won't exist. To send aletter, a picture or graph -- all of which will be generatedon a computer screen -- around the world, users will needonly to push the &quot;send &quot; button on their computers to achievea paperless transmission. As for copiers, they, too, will besubmerged as recognizable entities, transformed into thescanning and printing arms of a unified, computerized workorganism.   That organism, some experts say, could easily take theshape of a single desktop machine performing many functions.&quot;A machine like a Hydra won't be multifunctional because it'sdesigned to be multifunctional,&quot; says Jim Ivy of Ricoh Corp.,which is experimenting with such devices. &quot;It will bemultifunctional because that's where the technology naturallyleads.&quot;   ---   Mr. Hooper reports on technology from The Wall StreetJournal's New York bureau.   ---                      PCs in the Office                                                                                                          Based on a 1990 survey of 8,000 personal-computer users inthe workplace                                                                                                                             Age of Equipment                                                                                                          More than half of the personal computers currently used inbusiness are less than three years old                                                                                                          Year of purchase                                                                                                          1985 or before .................................... 18%   1986 .............................................. 10   1987 .............................................. 18   1988 .............................................. 27   1989 .............................................. 24   1990 ..............................................  3*                                                                                                          *As of March                                                                                                                             Type of Software                                                                                                          Percent of workers using software at least once a month,by type:                                                                                                          Word processing ................................... 84%   Spreadsheet ....................................... 63   Database management ............................... 48   Graphics .......................................... 39   File management ................................... 35   Communications .................................... 33   Integrated ........................................ 28   Desktop publishing ................................ 28   Accounting ........................................ 25   Desktop environment ............................... 23   Engineering/scientific/technical .................. 14   Project management (scheduling) ................... 11                                                                                                          Source: InfoCorp/Gartner Group, 1990</TEXT></DOC>
