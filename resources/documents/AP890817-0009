(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Robert P. Casey ran into a bit oftrouble when he tried to buy a fishing license: He couldn't prove hewas a Pennsylvania resident.   Casey told the tale at a recent builders' convention as a way ofdemonstrating that you're never as big a fish as you might think.   It happened a few weekends ago in Hamlin, population 300, inrural Wayne County, while the governor was taking a few days off athis vacation home at Lake Ariel. Casey was chauffeured and escortedby a state trooper, and wasn't carrying any identification.   The governor filled out an application and handed it to theclerk. Then, according to Casey:   ``She looks at me and says, `Are you a Pennsylvania resident?' ''   ``And I just deadpanned. I said, `Yes, I'm a Pennsylvaniaresident.' ''   ``She says, `You got a driver's license?' ''   ``I said no.''   ``You got a voter's card.''   ``No.''   ``You got the certificate of title to your car?''   ``No.''   ``She said, `Where do you live?' ''   ``And I said, `I live in Scranton, I got a place in Lake Arieland I'm a Pennsylvania resident.' ''   Finally, a trooper with Casey, dressed in shorts and a golfshirt, came to the governor's rescue.   ``Do you know this guy?'' the clerk asked the trooper. Theofficer said yes, he did, and yes, the guy is a Pennsylvaniaresident.   The clerk said, ``I'm going to make an exception in your case,''and issued the license. She made the trooper sign his name as awitness above Casey's.</TEXT><DATELINE>KETCHIKAN, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A curious cub got a free, one-way tripout of town after he wandered into the crowded terminal at theKetchikan airport.   The 25-pound bear, separated from its mother, tripped anelectronic eye on the terminal's automatic doors and wandered overto the baggage carousel, where he was surrounded by tourists.   Alaska Airlines employee John Naranjo said the cub bolted for astairway. Naranjo grabbed it by its bottom and the scruff of itsneck, while another man helped him place it in a portable kennel.   The bear was held overnight Saturday for observation and releasedthe next morning near where the mother bear had last been seen, saidTodd Sharp, a state wildlife protection officer. The cub sustained aminor scratch on its nose.   ``The tourists got a kick out of it,'' Naranjo said. ``One said,`Only in Alaska.' Another said, `They'll never believe me at home.'''</TEXT></DOC>
