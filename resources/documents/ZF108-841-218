Vanderploeg,referring to the agreement reached last March by the Defense Department andthe General Services Administration on DOD's use of the GSA-procured network.andM;Last month Vanderploeg and several other officials who attended a one-daysymposium on the ATandamp;T Co. portion of the network talked of their efforts toswitch to the multibillion-dollar system.andP;  The Environmental ProtectionAgency, for one, will depend on the FTS contract for almost all itscommunications services.andM;Replacing direct distance dialing and inbound and outbound 800 services withFTS 2000 services at McClellan was the first step in the process to have theFTS 2000 system supply voice services to a majority of Air Force bases bymid-1991, said Vanderploeg, chief of the Policy and Procedures Division inthe Air Force Telecommunications Certification Office at Scott Air ForceBase, Ill.andM;&quot;Scott will cut over some time in the fall, as all our bases eventually willbe switched to FTS 2000.andP;  We're lining them up, and we've set up a tentativeschedule for transitioning all bases,&quot; the official said.andM;Two 1.544-megabit/sec T1 lines now connect an on-base 5ESS switch throughwhich Pacific Bell Telephone of San Francisco, supplies Centrex services toMcClellan with an ATandamp;T FTS 2000 network 5ESS switch in Oakland, Calif.andP;  Thetwo circuits supply 48 64-kilobit/sec voice channels between the switches.andM;Vanderploeg said the base, which previously was getting long-distance servicefrom three vendors, already is seeing the benefits of using FTS 2000.andP;  Theseinclude a standardized access code, a single bill for services and a bettergrade of service, as FTS 2000 guarantees that less than 7 percent of thecalls placed on the network will be blocked.andM;Just One lineandM;Lacking a clear direction as yet from the Federal Aviation Administration,agency officials responsible for telecommunications in FAA's four-statecentral region have installed only a solitary FTS 2000 switched56-kilobit/sec line as a backup to a 56-kilobit/sec leased line runningbetween FAA offices in Des Moines, Iowa, and Kansas City, Mo.andM;Rodger Burton, an electronics engineer in the central region, said althoughFAA has switched users of the old FTS network to the new system and isreplacing the agency's packet-switching Administrative Data TransmissionNetwork with FTS 2000 services, it has not yet told the regions what otherFTS 2000 services they can get.andM;The official said FAA's move to FTS 2000 is complicated by the fact that thenine regions operate pretty much autonomously, with their own budgets andpurchasing power.andP;  However, any additional FTS 2000 services ordered by theregions would affect the overall FAA telecommunications budget, anduncertainty over FTS 2000 costs so far has kept FAA from letting the regionaloffices buy more FTS 2000 services, Burton said.andM;At EPA, however, there is no hesitancy to move to FTS 2000 data services.andO;Officials of Unisys Corp., facilities management contractor for EPA'sNational Data Processing Division at Research Triangle Park, N.C., said EPAwill be using FTS 2000 almost exclusively by the end of 1991.andM;EPA already has FTS 2000 384-kilobit/sec circuits for video conferencing atthree locations and plans to have video conferencing capabilities at 20locations some time next year, said Jim Von St Paul, telecommunicationsoperations manager for EPA's national data processing services.andM;&quot;The video conferencing rooms are booked 30 to 40 hours a week for people totalk between Washington, D.C., and Research Triangle Park,&quot; Von St Paul said.andM;Regional ConnectionsandM;ATandamp;T also has installed analog 9,600-bit/sec and 16.8- and 19.2-kilobit/secdedicated lines that connect the agency's state and field offices to regionaloffices, which in turn will be linked by 56-kilobit/sec dedicated circuits todivision headquarters in Research Triangle Park.andP;  Similar circuits willconnect EPA laboratories to Research Triangle Park.andM;Additional dedicated 56-kilobit/sec lines will make up a backbone thatconnects packet-switching nodes in regional offices and labs; still more56-kilobit/sec lines and T1 lines will make up a triangular backbone linkingEPA offices in Washington, D.C., Cincinnati and Research Triangle Park.andM;EPA also is using FTS 2000 Switched Digital Integrated Service (SDIS) at itsResearch Triangle Park and Cincinnati locations and plans to have SDIS at allregional offices, Von St Paul said.andP;  SDIS will allow EPA to bundle videoconferencing transmissions, 56-kilobit/sec data and other services onto asingle T1 connection, he said.andM;&quot;By about the end of fiscal year 1991, EPA should be all FTS 2000 for voice,data and video transmissions.andP;  All of our 800 inward station access servicefor voice data also will move to FTS 2000 next year,&quot; Von St Paul said.andM;The Air Force Space Command at Los Angeles Air Force Base has ordered FTS2000 video transmission services, said Cody Gossard, an ATandamp;T officialresponsible for FTS 2000 services.andM;Gossard said the Air Force wants video transmission over 56-kilobit/sec linesfor bases in Los Angeles, Onizuka and Vandenburg, Calif., and Patrick andCape Canaveral, Fla.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
