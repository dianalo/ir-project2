John F. Kerry, D-Mass., told the Senate before it ratified thetreaties, 99-0.   He said the conviction in New York's ``pizza connection'' caseof 17 members of a drug ring stretching from Italy and the UnitedStates was made possible by already existing ``mutual legalassistance treaties.''   The latest batch of treaties is the product of four years oftalks between the United States and the Cayman Islands, theBahamas, Belgium, Canada, Thailand and Mexico.   Provisions call for cooperation in taking testimony orstatements of witnesses, producing documents, records and evidence,executing searches and seizures, serving documents, assistance withforfeiture of assets.   Under the treaties, the attorney general could refuse to providesuch assistance and an ``understanding'' attached by the Senateprovided that no information about U.S. citizens would be furnishedto a foreign government if if would be seen by an official of thatcountry involved in drug trafficking.</TEXT></DOC>
