A Norwegian company that has builtconcrete sub-structures for 13 North Sea platforms believed it had agood chance at securing the contract to build a production platform forMobil. Norwegian contractors have become excited by a new tension legplatform concept chosen by Conoco for its 700 million barrel Heidrumfield development off Norway. Conoco believes this system can cut thecosts of developing its field by about 25%. Tension leg platforms, unlikeconventional platforms, are connected to the seabed by vertical tubularsteel mooring lines attached to structures on the seafloor. The buoyancyof the platform creates an upward force, keeping the legs under tensionand allowing the platform to float in place. Utilizing buoyancy in thismanner eliminates the need for complex substructures, which are extremelyexpensive for deep-water developments. A tension leg platform could beattractive to Mobil for Hibernia because of lower cost and it could havea high Canadian content. 1 illus.</TEXT></DOC>
