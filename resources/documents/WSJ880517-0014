Andrew J. Soffel, Crowley's president, said he doesn't believe that the purchase of 65,013 additional shares by the group Friday is part of an attempt to take over the Detroit area retail chain. Instead, he said, he thinks the group chose to boost its ownership stake while the company's stock was selling below its market value.    Fidelity International, an investment firm based in Bermuda, and FMR, a holding company based in Boston, purchased the stock for $25 a share from Patricia Morrison, a granddaughter of the company's founder. In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Crowley's stock closed yesterday at $28.50 a share, up 75 cents.    Before the sale, the group owned 10.9% of Crowley's 509,067 common shares outstanding. The group bought the additional shares for about $1.6 million and now holds a total of 120,513 shares. Officials of Fidelity International and FMR couldn't be reached for comment, nor could Ms. Morrison.    Earlier, Ms. Morrison and Fidelity International filed statements with the SEC advocating that Crowley be sold to &quot;maximize shareholder value,&quot; according to Mr. Soffel. Before the sale of Ms. Morrison's stock, four descendants of Crowley's founder controlled 51% of the company's stock. Now, said Mr. Soffel, the three family members who still own stock control 38.5% of the shares. </TEXT></DOC>
