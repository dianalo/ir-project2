Listed below are 86 countries with an income tax; 55 have cut their top rates in the past five years. In 29 countries there was no change and only two -- Luxembourg and Lebanon -- raised their top rates.    A word of caution should be kept in mind when analyzing this data. Social security, health and local income taxes are excluded. In many cases they can raise the tax burden significantly. For example, in Canada, which has a top federal income tax rate of 29%, the top rate of overall taxation for someone living in Quebec is 49.1%. Moreover, many countries have non-income taxes, such as value-added taxes, which may be more economically significant than the income tax.    It is also important to remember that the threshold of income at which the top rate begins is very important. In Honduras, for example, a taxpayer doesn't begin paying the top rate of 45% until he earns $500,000. By contrast, Mexico has a lower top rate -- 40% -- but it kicks in at $13,170.    While the trend toward lower taxation is especially evident when looking at top rates, a country's top rate is an important indicator of its overall tax and economic system. Countries with confiscatory rates at the top generally also tax those in the middle and the bottom more heavily. As F.A. Hayek once remarked, the principal function of high marginal income-tax rates is to justify higher taxes on everyone.    ---   Mr. Bartlett is deputy assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury.    ---@ 1985 1989 @ Argentina 45% 35% @ Australia 60 49 @ Austria 62 50 @ Bangladesh 60 50 @ Barbados 60 50 @ Belgium 71.5 55 @ Belize 50 50 @ Bolivia 30 10 @ Bophuthatswana 40 40 @ Botswana 60 50 @ Brazil 60 25 @ Canada 34 29 @ Channel Islands 20 20 @ Chile 56 50 @ China 45 45 @ Columbia 49 30 @ Costa Rica 50 25 @ Cyprus 60 60 @ Denmark 73 72 @ Dominica 55 45 @ Dominican Republic 73.1 73.1 @ Ecuador 46 46 @ Egypt 65 65 @ El Salvador 60 60 @ Fiji 50 50 @ Finland 51 44 @ France 65 56.8 @ Ghana 60 55 @ Greece 63 50 @ Guatemala 48 34 @ Honduras 40 40 @ Hong Kong 25 25 @ Iceland 44 28.5 @ India 61.9 50 @ Indonesia 35 35 @ Ireland 65 58 @ Isle of Man 20 20 @ Italy 65 50 @ Ivory Coast 37.5 37.5 @ Jamaica 57.5 33.3 @ Japan 70 50 @ Kenya 65 50 @ Lebanon 44 50 @ Liberia 73 73 @ Libya 35 35 @ Luxembourg 57 58.8 @ Malawi 50 50 @ Malaysia 45 45 @ Malta 65 65 @ Mexico 55 40 @ Morocco 60 60 @ Netherlands 72 72 @ New Zealand 66 33 @ Nigeria 70 55 @ Norway 40 27.5 @ Pakistan 60 45 @ Panama 56 56 @ Papua New Guinea 50 45 @ Paraguay 30 30 @ Peru 50 45 @ Philippines 60 35 @ Portugal 76.6 40 @ Puerto Rico 67.5 38 @ Senegal 65 60 @ Singapore 40 33 @ South Africa 50 45 @ South Korea 70.1 63.7 @ Spain 66 56 @ Sri Lanka 55 40 @ Sudan 70 40 @ Swaziland 50 45 @ Sweden 80 72 @ Switzerland 11.5 11.5 @ Taiwan 60 50 @ Tanzania 95 55 @ Thailand 65 55 @ Trinidad andamp; Tobago 70 45 @ Turkey 55 50 @ Uganda 70 60 @ U.K. 60 60 @ U.S. 50 28 @ Venezuela 45 45 @ West Germany 56 56 @ Zaire 60 60 @ Zambia 80 75 @ Zimbabwe 61.1 60 @ Unweighted Average 55.5 46.7 @ Source: Compiled by author from Price Waterhouse and Coopers andamp; Lybrand tax guides. </TEXT></DOC>
