L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., said bank profits for the three months ending Dec. 31 hit arecord $6.5 billion, $600 million higher than the previous record of$5.9 billion set in the third quarter of 1988.   In previewing the report in a speech on Monday, Seidman had saidprofits were $6.7 billion in the fourth quarter and $25.3 billionfor all of 1988. However, that number did not include a single largebank that reported losses of $205 million for the quarter and $125million for the year.   The $25.2 billion for all of 1988, up from $2.8 billion in 1987,tops the previous high of $18.1 billion, set in 1985.   The U.S. economy, as measured by the gross national product, lastyear expanded at the fastest pace in four years and the business ofmost of the nation's 13,114 commercial banks expanded along with it.Also, Third World loan problems, which forced banks to take biglosses in 1987, improved somewhat.   ``By far the most important factor has been the economy, whichhas been strong and has been reflected in banking results. Inflationis basically under control,'' Seidman said at a news conferencetoday.   However, he noted that deposits grew only 4 percent in the year,about half the rate needed to keep up with inflation and economicgrowth, indicating banks were suffering competitively against mutualfunds and other alternative investments.   Commercial banks as a whole were earning the profits while asevere recession in oil-producing states pushed bank failures to apost-Depression high of 221.   Seidman predicted that bank failures would fall by about 20percent this year. Thirty banks have failed so far in 1989, comparedwith 44 during the same period last year.   Seidman chided banks for passing on $13 billion of last year'sprofits to stockholders and cautioned that the earnings figures wereinflated by ``many unusual, non-recurring events.''   ``That amount (of dividends) represents 52 percent of the year'searnings. A more conservative approach would have provided a greatercapital base to improve 1989 earnings,'' he said.   He said the nation's largest banks in the fourth quarter beganrecording interest income on loans to Brazil, which resumed payinginterest on its $110 billion debt.   In addition, the $2.3 billion loss posted by First RepublicBankCorp. of Dallas was excluded from the industry's year-end resultsbecause it was closed by regulators and reopened under a new owner.Those two factors alone pumped up 1988 earnings by more than $5billion.   The high rate of failures in 1988 caused the FDIC to register aloss for the first time since it was established in 1934. Theinsurance fund shrank from $18.3 billion at the end of 1987 to near$14 billion at the end of 1988.   President Bush is proposing to replenish the FDIC fund byincreasing banks' deposit insurance premium from 83 cents per $100of deposits to $1.50.   Seidman said the higher insurance rate, if adopted, will cut intoprofits this year, but industry performance will be determinedlargely by the state of inflation and the economy. Privateeconomists expect inflation to edge up this year and they predicteconomic growth will slow in the second half.   ``I think it's safe to say that commercial bank profits will lookgood next to thrift profits (in 1989), but they will be nothing tobrag about,'' said Paul Getman, an analyst with The Wefa Group, aconsulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.   The nation's 2,950 savings and loans likely will show recordlosses this year topping $10 billion. The Federal Home Loan BankBoard reports later this month on that industry's performance for1988.   The bank board this afternoon is due to report on depositwithdrawals in January. Bank board chairman M. Danny Wall, incongressional testimony earlier this month, said a preliminaryestimate showed net withdrawals at a near-record $7 billion.   He said most of that was caused by higher returns offered byalternate investments such as money market funds, but privateanalysts blamed some of the outflow on depositor worries triggeredby news accounts of Sandamp;L problems.   Getman said steadily rising interest rates will squeeze both Sandamp;Land bank earnings this year, but slower economic growth won't hurtgreatly until next year. Most bank loans have adjustable interestrates and as rates rise, delinquencies increase, he said.   Also, Getman said, the nation's biggest banks, under TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady's initiative announced last week, will comeunder more pressure to write off Third World debt. In addition,once-stellar large regional banks are having real estate problems inNew Jersey, Boston and Atlanta, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
