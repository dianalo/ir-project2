Consider the confusion over the SS-20, the major weapon the Soviets are supposed to remove if the treaty is ratified. The administration can't seem to figure out how many SS-20s the Soviets really have. Last July the CIA and State Department estimated the Soviets had about 550, while the Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, figured 1,200. When INF was signed last November, the Soviets said 650. Just last month, however, the CIA and State Department reached new estimates of 700, while DIA stuck with 1,200. The &quot;national intelligence estimate,&quot; a consensus view, is 950.    Grade-school arithmetic can tell you that if the Soviets chop up 650 missiles out of 950 they will have 300 left under the zero-option agreement. The administration argues that this is a tempest in a teapot, since the Soviet figure of 650 is &quot;within the range of our uncertainties.&quot; We wonder how many Americans would be surprised to learn that the supposedly verifiable INF agreement depends on a &quot;range of uncertainties,&quot; extending from zero to 300, not to mention 550 if the high DIA estimate happens to be right.    The much-advertised &quot;on-site inspection&quot; of Soviet bases might help us verify the number of SS-20s, of course, except that the inspection sites are specified by the treaty. If the Soviets ever want to cheat, all they have to do is put the missiles where the inspectors aren't allowed to go.    Another Helms whale was Article 14, the &quot;non-circumvention&quot; clause. This says the U.S. and Soviets &quot;shall not assume any international obligations or undertakings&quot; that would violate the treaty. That sounds simple enough, but several senators are wondering if it isn't an ambiguity big enough for the Soviets to drive a reinterpretation through.    &quot;What is the purpose of this language?&quot; Senator Dan Quayle asked in his opening statement last week. The plausible concern is that the clause could keep the U.S. from selling its allies technology that they need to defend themselves. Indeed, the Soviets already are saying INF prohibits the U.S. from modernizing the shorter-range nuclear weapons that will remain in Europe after INF is implemented.    The concern is heightened because the paragraph wasn't even in the treaty until late last November. &quot;Who insisted on Article 14, by the way? They or us?&quot; Senator Helms asked Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci on Monday. Replied Mr. Carlucci: &quot;They wanted a real non-circumvention clause, and our negotiators negotiated them down to this kind of a provision.&quot; Mr. Carlucci dismissed the Soviet claims that INF prohibits NATO modernization as &quot;pure nonsense&quot; and &quot;propaganda.&quot; The Reagan administration said similar things about the ambiguities in the 1972 ABM Treaty, only to find Senator Sam Nunn arguing that the Soviet interpretation was more correct.    INF also removes U.S. ground-launched cruise missiles from Europe, but what about air-launched or sea-launched cruises? Since the guidance systems are similar in all three types, are we also banned from providing them to our allies? Cruises are essential, of course, because they can carry conventional warheads, and thus defend Europe without threatening a nuclear exchange. But the U.S. gave up all ground-launched cruises as part of the INF because we said it was impossible to distinguish between nuclear and conventional. And on Monday Senator Joe Biden already was arguing that the same logic should apply to air-launched or sea-launched cruises in the START talks.    Unlike presidential dropout Biden, of course, Senator Helms is supposed to be off-the-wall. His original &quot;crimson whale&quot; was the issue of whether the treaty calls for the destruction of any nuclear warheads. It doesn't, as Mr. Carlucci explained at length: &quot;The warhead essentially consists of the physics package -- high explosives, highly enriched uranium, plutonium. That package, consistent with other weapons systems that have been destroyed, could either be reused or, depending on the circumstances, recyled.&quot; Keeping warheads is a good part of the treaty, he explained, because the Soviets can produce new ones easier than we can.    So Senator Helms's whales are that the treaty doesn't eliminate any nuclear weapons, that we can't verify it well enough to say whether remaining Soviet SS-20s missiles will be zero or 550, and that it's ambiguous enough to be interpreted as cutting NATO allies off from technical assistance for the most modern conventional weapons. Senator Helms, it would appear to us, is the last one whose face should be crimson. </TEXT></DOC>
