Computer analysis of plasma 14C-MT kinetics showeda three-compartment system with half-lives of 0.21 +/- 0.05, 5.97 +/-1.11, and 47.52 +/- 8.86 min. The volume of distribution and the clearancewere 1,736 +/- 349 ml.kg-1 and 25.1 +/- 1.7 ml.min-1.kg-1 respectively.The entry of 14C-MT into the CSF was rapid and reached a maximum at 5min. The decay followed a two-compartment system with half-lives of 16.5+/- 2.9 and 47.3 +/- 8.6 min. The CSF/plasma concentration ratio was0.38 at the steady state (30 min). At 2 min the level of 14C-MT in thebrain was 3.8 higher than in the CSF. Representative autoradiograms revealedan heterogeneous localization of 14C-MT in the grey matter. The highestregional values, as evaluated by the permeability area product technique,were found in cortex, thalamic nuclei, medial geniculate nucleus, anteriorpretectal area, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, choroidplexuses, and bulb-pons. Thirty minutes later 14C-MT was still detectedin most of the brain regions analyzed. These results point to a low butrapid penetration of circulating MT into the brain and the CSF. The heterogeneousdistribution and the partial retention of 14C-MT in the brain are compatiblewith the hypothesis of a central action of this hormone mediated viabinding sites.</TEXT></DOC>
