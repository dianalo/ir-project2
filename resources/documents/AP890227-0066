Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., and formerBrooklyn, N.Y., Democratic boss Meade Esposito today lost SupremeCourt appeals aimed at overturning their convictions for exchangingillegal gratuities.   The court, without comment, cleared the way for Biaggi'simprisonment on a 2{-year term. Esposito was sentenced to two yearsprobation and 500 hours of community service.   Each man also was fined $500,000.   Biaggi, who served 10 terms in Congress, was forced to resignfrom the House of Representatives last Aug. 5 following hisconviction on racketeering charges in another case.   He has been sentenced to eight years in prison in that case,which involves the Wedtech Corp. and charges that the ex-congressmanillegally took $1.8 million in stocks and cash from the Bronx, N.Y.,business.   The case acted on today involved charges that Biaggi acceptedfree vacations from Esposito in exchange for helping a financiallytroubled ship-repair company in Brooklyn.   Biaggi was convicted in November 1987 of accepting gratuities forofficial acts and obstruction of justice, and Esposito was convictedof giving the gratutities.   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the convictions lastAugust after rejecting arguments that prosecutors violated thedefendants' rights by excluding some Italian-Americans from the jury.   The appeals court said the prospective jurors were excluded forlegitimate reasons other than their Italian descent, and noted thatat least two Italian-Americans served on the jury that convictedBiaggi and Esposito.   The case is Biaggi vs. U.S., 88-828.</TEXT></DOC>
