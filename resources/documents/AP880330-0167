Kirkpatrick, aformer U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told a GOP panel atthe start of the first of three 1988 national platform hearings.   ``At the end of Ronald Reagan's presidency, the United States isstronger and relations with the Soviets are stronger,'' said Mrs.Kirkpatrick.   Wednesday's session on foreign policy matters will be followedby hearings in Kansas City, Mo., on May 31, and Los Angeles on June30, in advance of the GOP National Convention in New Orleans Aug.15-18, where a platform will be produced.   The May session will focus on education, child care andneighborhood development matters, while the June hearing willconcentrate on economic growth.   Vice President Bush is leading the GOP presidential delegaterace. Dole, a senator from Kansas who had been his main challengerin the early primaries and caucuses, withdrew from the contest onTuesday, leaving Pat Robertson still running but far behind Bush.   Mrs. Kirkpatrick, who provided a foreign policy overview at theplatform hearing, said the most important accomplishment of theReagan administration has been to ``demonstrate through domesticand foreign policy the power of freedom.''   She said progress has been made during Reagan's tenure inrebuilding American military forces and bringing terrorists tojustice. She added that progress also has been achieved inU.S.-Soviet relations.   Former Reagan administration officials, think-tankrepresentatives and members of Congress testified before theRepublican Platform Committee Panel on what they saw as thesuccesses of the Reagan years and on their views of the Carter eraand of the Democratic presidential candidates.   More than 60 legislators and former officials arranged totestify on issues including those involving Central America,international terrorism, U.S.-Soviet relations, defense resources,veterans, and Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, alsoknown as Star Wars.   L. Francis Bouchey, a member of the Council for Inter-AmericanSecurity, accused leading Democratic candidates Michael Dukakis andJesse Jackson of attempting to return to what he called the``failed years of the Carter administration.''   Bouchey accused the Democrats of ``neo-isolationism andon-again, off-again support of the Nicaraguan resistance fighters.''   Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., urged the party to ``be in step withthe majority of Americans, including American women.''   ``Women may well determine who is the next president. Theyprobably will decide some Senate and congressional races thisNovember,'' Green said in a statement released before his testimony.   ``It would not be smart for a political party to ignore or angersuch voters. Yet there is a danger of the Republican Party's doingjust that,'' he said.   The panel included GOP National Committee Chairman Frank J.Fahrenkopf Jr.; Maureen Reagan, co-chairman of the RepublicanNational Committee; Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis.; Rep. JerryLewis, R-Calif.; Chuck Hardwick, speaker of the New Jersey StateAssembly; and Delaware Gov. Michael N. Castle.</TEXT></DOC>
