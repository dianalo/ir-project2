Traders said the market's early weakness reflected concern abouta 479 million-pound ($812 million) rights issue and bid by GrandMetropolitan PLC for Pillsbury Co. of the United States and thegovernment-ordered reduction of the Kuwait Investment Office'sstake in British Petroleum.   Several dealers were at a loss to pinpoint the drift higher.   But others said shares recovered amid a lack of selling pressureand because few bargain hunters took advantage of the market's lowlevels.   Some dealers were encouraged by the fact share prices didn'tfall even further in the morning.   ``I can see no reason why we're going better, except that we'vesimply reversed engines after this morning's slide,'' one equitysalesman said.   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 4.7points, or 0.3 percent, higher at 1,807.3, slightly below the day'sbest level of 1808.2. The index lost as much as 15.6 points inearly dealings.   At the close, the narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up1.8 points at 1,457.6.   Volume was still at relatively slack levels, with 440.0 millionshares changing hands, compared with the 337.4 million sharestraded Monday.   Wall Street was largely overlooked by London players, severaldealers said.   The market's early weakness reflected concern about the GrandMet rights issue to fund an unsolicited $5.12 billion tender offerfor Pillsbury, dealers said.   Shares in Grand Met were among the major movers, falling 32pence to 454 pence on the news. Grand Met shares were heavilytraded, with stock exchange figures showing 14 million sharestraded by the close.   Sentiment also turned sour as the British government ordered theKuwait Investment Office to sharply reduce its holding in BritishPetroleum to 9.9 percent from the current 21.68 percent over aperiod of around 12 months.   The announcement triggered a flurry of heavy trading in BritishPetroleum shares.   Dealers said the decision had been expected, but many analystshad predicted the Kuwaitis would only be required to reduce theirholding to around 15 percent.   British Petroleum shares finished unchanged at 237 on volume of14 million shares, after dropping to a low of 227.</TEXT></DOC>
