Carter Pate, president ofPate, Winters andamp; Associates, liquidating trustee for theNelson Bunker Hunt estate. &quot;Now you've got the rest of thefamily dragged into it and it's a shame.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Late yesterday, attorneys for the trustees filed a motionwith Federal Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson, who oversawthe bankruptcy cases of the former oil tycoons, seeking hispermission to file a lawsuit in the bankruptcy court inDallas.   The proposed suit alleges that the Hunt brothers&quot;fraudulently or preferentially&quot; transferred cash, realestate and other property out of their estates prior to Sept.21, 1988, when they and their wives filed for protection fromcreditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.   But since both brothers' Chapter 11 cases have beencompleted, the trustees are legally unable to assert newcharges or name the two as defendants.   Named as defendants are beneficiaries of the varioustransfers, including the brothers' nine children and theirspouses, 27 Hunt grandchildren and several friends andbusiness associates who served as trustees and corporateofficers of various entities benefiting or owned by the Huntfamily members.   Also named are several family-owned companies; brotherLamar Hunt, who allegedly received more than $1.8 million indebt payments from his brothers during the year before theirbankruptcy filings; and Dallas-based Southwestern LifeInsurance Co., which allegedly issued a $1.2 million lifeinsurance policy to a trust benefiting Bunker Hunt'sgrandchildren.   Attorneys representing the Hunts declined to comment onthe substance of the allegations. &quot;We are in the process ofreviewing the alleged claims,&quot; said Dallas attorney AlbertMcGrath, who represents various Hunt interests and familymembers. Southwestern Life couldn't be reached for comment.   Following the brothers' disastrous speculation in the1979-80 silver market, huge losses in oil and real estate andlong-running litigation with creditors and the InternalRevenue Service, &quot;bankruptcy was inevitable&quot; by 1987, thesuit contends. &quot;It was against this backdrop that the Huntbrothers began shifting their remaining assets to theirfriends and relatives with actual intent to hinder, delay ordefraud their creditors.&quot;   The suit alleges that during the months just prior totheir bankruptcy filings, the brothers disposed of more than$80 million in assets through newly created limitedpartnerships involving their children and corporations andtrusts either owned by or benefiting their children andgrandchildren.   The suit contends that the brothers contributed most ofsuch partnerships' assets but received relatively smallownership interests, gave up all control and sometimesemployed a secondary round of asset transfers to furtherhinder recovery by creditors.   In one instance, the suit alleges that Herbert Hunttransferred $72 million of real estate -- much of itpurchased from his children and their trusts -- to threepartnerships created about one month before his filing.Although Mr. Hunt allegedly contributed about 74% of the newpartnerships' capital assets, he received only a 35% limitedpartnership interest, while a corporation owned by hischildren became the general, and controlling, partner inreturn for a $3 million contribution.   The suit also seeks the recovery of nearly $11.9 millionused to fund a family-owned company involved in a high-risk-- and ultimately failed -- oil drilling venture in SouthYemen. In addition, the suit seeks the recovery of certaingifts made to trusts benefiting Hunt children andgrandchildren between 1985 and 1988.   ---   PFIZER AGREES to pay $3.1 million fine for water-pollutionviolations.   The federal fine against Pfizer Inc., a New York drug andpharmaceuticals company, involved its dumping of ammonia andiron oxide into the Delaware River at its former plant inEaston, Pa.   Pfizer signed a consent decree with the U.S. JusticeDepartment and the Environmental Protection Agency agreeingto the fine. But in a separate release, the companychallenged the government's assertion that the fine set arecord for civil penalties under the Clean Water Act. Thecompany also denied its dumping did any damage and said itsettled that case because of legal uncertainty over differing&quot;interpretations of the facts&quot; involved.   &quot;They signed a consent decree and that spoke for itself,&quot;said a spokesperson at the EPA's regional office inPhiladelphia, where the case was investigated.   The case against Pfizer was initiated a decade ago by theCoalition of Religious and Civic Organizations, a citizensgroup in Easton. The Justice Department and the EPA laterfiled the suit alleging that Pfizer didn't pretreatquantities of ammonia and iron oxide produced at its formerPfizer Pigments Inc. unit in Easton before dumping theindustrial pollutants into the local sewage treatment system.Also named in the complaints were the city of Easton and thecompany that now owns the plant, Harcros Pigments Inc., aunit of Harrison's andamp; Crosfield PLC in London.   According to the consent decree, filed in federal court inPhiladelphia, the discharges took place from 1984 untilJanuary 1990 and contributed to the destruction of the EastonArea Joint Sewer Authority's secondary treatment plant.Pfizer sold the plant last year. Federal officials said thatclaims for civil fines are still pending against Easton andHarcros Pigments.   Pfizer said yesterday that the sewer authority was awareof the company's discharges into the Delaware and evenimposed a surcharge for its treatment. No permit was everissued, Pfizer conceded, but the company claimed it operatedunder written assurances that one would be coming.   The EPA said the enforcement action was part of acrackdown on companies and municipalities nationwide toenforce pretreatment regulations for the dumping ofindustrial pollutants into local sewage treatment plants andlocal waterways.   The agency said five cities, including Los Angeles, andsix companies were named in civil suits seeking fines andinjunctions.   ---   BAN ON JURY TRIALS in suits against New York City to beproposed.   The city's top lawyer, Victor A. Kovner, said the citywill ask the state legislature to adopt an amendment to thestate constitution that would effectively bar jury trials fornegligence suits filed against the city. The purpose: to cutdown on huge damage awards that are eating away at the city'streasury.   The controversial plan, which is circulating in draftform, comes at a time of fiscal crisis for New York City. Mr.Kovner said Mayor David Dinkins, who has already announcedlayoffs and cuts in social services, backs the proposal.   New York City paid $170 million in settlements andjudgments in personal-injury suits during fiscal 1990, morethan any other municipality in the nation. &quot;Wildlyinappropriate jury verdicts,&quot; Mr. Kovner says, wreak havoc onthe city's tight budget. He says the proposal would save $50million in the first year and hundreds of millions of dollarsover the decade.   The proposal calls for the adoption of an amendment to thestate constitution and legislation shifting negligence suitsfiled against municipalities, public benefit corporations,public authorities and their employees to the jurisdiction ofthe Court of Claims. That court currently decides suitsagainst New York state without jury trials.   Harvey Weitz, a New York plaintiffs' lawyer who has wonbig judgments against the city, said personal-injury lawyerswill fight the plan. Taking decision-making power away fromjurors &quot;philosophically goes against everything theadministration supposedly stands for,&quot; he said.   Some law professors said the proposal, if adopted, mightface a challenge in the U.S. Supreme Court because it raisesconstitutional issues about citizens' rights to a jury trial.But Mr. Kovner countered that the right to a civil jury trialis a limited one in cases involving the government and that&quot;a jury trial {in these types of cases} is a luxury thesociety can no longer afford.&quot;   Other lawyers questioned the plan's underlying assumptionthat jury awards are excessive, particularly considering thatmost large jury awards are cut dramatically on appeal.   &quot;What is the evidence that the juries aren't doingjustice?&quot; asked Hans Zeisel, a University of Chicago lawprofessor and the author of the most comprehensive academicstudy ever on the American jury.   &quot;This is a way to make money at the expense of citizens'rights,&quot; he said.   ---   LIQUOR MAKERS don't have to warn consumers about drinking,court rules.   A group of plaintiffs had sued Joseph E. Seagram andamp; SonsInc. in state court in Beaumont, Texas, in 1988, charging,among other things, that the company failed to warn them thatdrinking excessive amounts of liquor could lead toalcoholism. The suit also alleged that the company'sadvertising encouraged alcohol consumption and implied thatdrinking was safe.   A trial court dismissed the claims. But a Texas appealscourt last year reversed the decision and reinstated all ofthe claims, attracting the attention of product-liabilitylawyers.   The Texas Supreme Court, however, sided with the trialcourt. In a seven-page decision, Judge Jack Hightowerconcluded that Seagram didn't have any duty to warn consumersbecause the dangers of excessive and prolonged drinking are&quot;ordinary knowledge common to the community.&quot;   David Ichel of Simpson, Thacher andamp; Bartlett, whorepresented New York-based Seagram, suggested that thedecision could affect future tobacco litigation, as well assuits against spirits-makers, &quot;where the court acknowledgesthat the danger is in the realm of common knowledge.&quot;   Plaintiffs' attorneys in the case couldn't immediately bereached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
