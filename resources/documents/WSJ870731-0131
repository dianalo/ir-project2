The noncommittal action reflected deep divisions within the committee on legislation that has wide support in both houses but is nearly certain to draw a presidential veto. The House Ways and Means Committee is expected to approve a similar measure Monday.    Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) had promised to bring the legislation to the floor after opponents knocked it out of the sweeping trade bill that the Senate passed overwhelmingly last week. But Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood, the committee's ranking Republican, yesterday moved to send the bill to the floor without a recommendation and vowed to fight it at that stage. There were no objections to Mr. Packwood's motion.    Since the House bill has 246 sponsors and the Senate version 50, passage is nearly assured. The remaining question is whether the legislation can draw enough additional votes to override a presidential veto. Last year, the House failed to override Mr. Reagan's veto on an earlier textile bill by only a few votes.    The Senate bill, a near duplicate of that approved by the House Ways and Means Committee's trade subcommittee two weeks ago, would allow annual growth of only 1% in each category for 10 years, using the 1986 level as a base. Non-rubber footwear imports, however, would be held to 1986 levels this year and allowed 1% annual growth over the same period starting next year.    Current bilateral accords limit the growth of imports from major Asian suppliers such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea to 1% or less, but allow greater growth for other countries. And there are no textile quotas for any industrialized countries except Japan.    The bill's sponsors claim that the new measure is less discriminatory than last year's because it would impose global limits rather than target major importers as the 1986 measure did. However, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter told the Senate panel that the latest version is no less protectionist. &quot;We can't simply charge around the world, setting trade rules with impunity,&quot; he testified.    Mr. Yeutter also warned that the bill would cost U.S. consumers between $28 billion to $37 billion in higher retail prices over a five-year period.    The bill would allow the president to negotiate compensation for trade injuries claimed by textile-exporting countries. The compensation would be in the form of tariff reductions of as much as 10% on textile imports. The measure also would provide for a Commerce Department review of the measure's effects 10 years after enactment. </TEXT></DOC>
