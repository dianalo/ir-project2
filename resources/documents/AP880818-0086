Police spokesman Hermann Wahl said the BMW the bandits extortedfrom Dutch authorities in return for hostages' freedom was parkedin front of a regional television and radio affiliate in the RhineRiver city of Cologne.   The gunmen left the Netherlands about 6:30 a.m. in thehigh-powered car and returned to this country, where on Wednesdaythey killed a teen-ager among 25 hostages on the bus.   A West German police officer was also killed Wednesday in a carcrash while pursuing the bus, and two hostages were shot andwounded early today before the hijackers left the Netherlands,authorities said.   Their conditions were not known.   Police said the remaining 23 hostages either escaped or werefreed after the bus rolled to a stop about 1:45 a.m. in theNetherlands, two days after the crime spree began.   Police spokesman Hermann Wahl in the city of Recklinghausen, 40miles north of Cologne, said the female accomplice apparently wasshot today in the Netherlands when two of the hostages tried toflee.   Hesse state radio in Frankfurt said the bandits stopped at apharmacy after returning to West Germany to get medicine andbandages for her.   West Germany's ARD television network showed lengthy footage ofthe chase, including shots of one bandit counting a wad of cash.   Wahl said that after most of the hostages were set free near theDutch border town of Oldenzaal, the assailants, their companion andtwo female hostages got into the BMW and raced back into WestGermany at about 8 a.m.   He said the condition of the bus hostages was ``good'' and theywere being examined by doctors.   Wahl identified the gunmen as Hans-Juergen Roesner, 31, andDieter Degowski, 32. The accomplice's name was not released. Wahlsaid she joined the hijacking after it started, but did not specifywhen.   The crime spree began Tuesday with a bank robbery in the WestGerman city of Gladbeck. The robbers escaped with two hostages and$227,000 in a car provided by police.   The gunmen next surfaced Wednesday in the West German city ofBremen, about 135 miles from Gladbeck. There, police said theyopened fire in a vegetable market and took a third hostage. No onewas injured.   The bandits then commandeered a nearby passenger bus and droveaway with 30 hostages. Five elderly people were later freed.   Along a West German highway en route to the Netherlands, thehijackers shot a 15-year-old boy on the bus and dumped him at ahighway rest stop.   The victim, an Italian whose identity was not released, diedlater in a Bremen hospital, police said.   A West German police officer was also killed and two othersinjured in a car crash while pursuing the bus. No further detailson that incident were immediately available.   Police in the Netherlands said the hijackers freed five hostagesafter crossing the border, but demanded a getaway car in return forfreedom for the remaining captives. During the stand-off, the bussat in a deserted parking lot about 115 miles southwest of Bremen.   Police cordoned off the area, and onlookers and reporters werekept at least 1.5 miles away.   The ZDF television network showed film of one bandit holding hispistol against the head of a small girl outside the bus in Bremen.   ARD television showed lengthy footage of the chase, includingshots of one bandit counting cash.   The female accomplice had earlier been seized by West Germanpolice when the bus stopped at a highway rest area, but police lether go when one of the gunmen threatened to shoot a hostage.   Two hostages were freed there at the rest area. Associated Pressphotographer Peter Maer said that as the bus headed back onto thehighway, the gunmen opened fire inside, their bullets smashingwindows.   Many passengers could be seen standing in the back of the bus,Maer said, but he did not know whether the bandits were shooting atthe hostages or just at the windows.</TEXT></DOC>
