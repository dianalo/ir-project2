Mann, 75, disappeared May 12 as he drove to a bank inSyrian-policed Moslem west Beirut.   None of Lebanon's kidnap groups has specifically identified himas a hostage. But a previously unknown faction, the Cells of ArmedStruggle, claimed that it kidnapped an unidentified Briton in Beirutthe day Mann disappeared.   It demanded the release of Arabs jailed in Britain for the 1987killing of Palestinian cartoonist Ali Naji al-Adhami. But ScotlandYard said no arrests had been made in that slaying.   There has been no word since then about Mann's whereabouts.   His wife, Sunny, said she received a telephone call Monday froman unidentified man who told her: ``I have bad news about yourhusband.''   She said she later met the man at a shop in west Beirut's Hamracommercial thoroughfare and ``he told me that Jack is dead.   ``I waited, but there was no news about Jack on Tuesday,Wednesday or Thursday,'' Mrs. Mann told reporters at her west Beirutapartment.   ``I don't know. There's no proof that he's dead at the moment,''she said.   But she noted that the report of her husband's alleged death``seems correct.''   Mrs. Mann refused to answer any more questions.   A British Embassy spokeswoman, who asked that her name was notused, said the embassy ``has no information at all about thereported death of Mr. Mann.''   ``We're trying to contact Mrs. Mann to find out what she knows,but we haven't been able to talk to her yet,'' she said.   The Manns lived in Beirut for 43 years. Mann worked as a pilotwith Lebanon's national airline, Middle East Arlines, for more than20 years before retiring to manage a bar in Beirut.   He is one of 16 Westerners missing in Lebanon. Most are heldhostage by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants.   The other Westerners are eight Americans, three Britons, two WestGermans, an Italian and an Irishman.   The longest held hostage is American journalist Terry Anderson,Chief Middle East Correspondent for The Associated Press. He waskindapped March 16, 1985.   The last foreign hostage to have died in Lebanon was U.S. MarineLt. Col. William R. Higgins, who was abducted Feb. 17, 1988, whileon U.N. duty in Lebanon.   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimedJuly 31 it hanged him in retaliation for Israel's abduction of aShiite Moslem cleric in Lebanon. Some reports say the killingoccurred months earlier, however.   Shortly after Higgins' reported hanging, Joseph Cicippio, anotherU.S. hostage, was threatened with death, then given a reprieve.</TEXT></DOC>
