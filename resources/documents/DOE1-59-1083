Yet primaryenergy demand of the residential sector was only 17% higher than in 1970,and &quot;useful&quot; energy demand (i.e. excluding transformation losses in powerplants and home furnaces) was only 5% higher. On a per capita basis,primary energy demand, which grew by 57% between 1960 and 1973, was 8%less in 1985 than in the peak year of 1973. Useful energy demand percapita was 16% less. Demand per household declined even more, as theaverage household became smaller and thus had gradually less demand forenergy services. The increase in the demand for services, which arosefrom more households, each with more appliances, was balanced by a decreasein the energy demand associated with each service. This decrease in energyintensity has been shaped by responses to higher energy costs and bytechnological change. The changes in residential energy demand are outgrowthsof structural changes in the physical setting (geographic distributionof the population, household characteristics, and the state of buildingsand their energy-using equipment), along with behavioral changes (people'samount of time at home and their behavior in the home). The structuralfeatures and behavior are in turn shaped by the economic setting, theinstitutional setting (i.e. the orientation of governments, energy suppliers,and equipment manufacturers), demographic changes, and the social psychologicalsetting that influences household energy-related decisions and behavior.This article reviews the changes since 1970 in US residential energyconsumption and in the structure of the household sector. The main sourcesfor data at the national level are statistics gathered by various federalagencies, especially the Energy Information Administration of the USDepartment of Energy.</TEXT></DOC>
