(column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Grunin, Lori.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>AdvisorandM;ANOTHER EYESAVER Your recommendation of SkiSoft Publishing's No-Squint LaptopCursor to cure a faint cursor on an LCD screen was a good one (PC Advisor, PCMagazine, April 11, 1989), but there is an alternative that laptop ownersshould be aware of: NoBlink/Accelerator by Nostradamus Inc. ($49.95; 3191Valley St., #252, Salt Lake City, UT 84109; (801) 487-9662).andP;  NoBlink was oneof PC Magazine's favorite utilities in 1987.andM;Neither No-Squint nor NoBlink works perfectly with all software.andP;  I leantoward NoBlink because it works better with Microsoft's CodeView, while oneof my colleagues prefers No-Squint because it behaves well with the NumberCruncher statistical system.andP;  Gerard Dallal Malden, MassachusettsandM;ONE-FINGER TYPINGandM;I am trying to locate two pieces of software that should make working with anIBM-compatible computer easier for a person who has the use of only one hand.andM;The first is a utility that allows key combinations, such as Ctrl-F8, to bepressed in sequence rather than together.andP;  The second package is a commercialpackage called PRD+.andP;  Elizabeth Swoope Johnston Baton Rouge, LouisianaandM;As you probably know, Productivity Plus--also known as PRD+--is acustomizable TSR that expands abbreviations as you type them.andP;  For example,when you type &quot;asap,&quot; PRD+ automatically expands it to &quot;as soon as possible.&quot;andO;The program, available directly from Productivity Software International(1220 Broadway, New York, NY 10001; (212) 967-8666) comes in two editions: a4,000-abbreviation Standard Version for $89.95 and an 8,000-abbreviationProfessional Version for $129.95.andM;What you might not know is that the company also includes on the PRD+ disk aprogram called Peck, which allows you to enter keystrokes sequentially.andP;  Peckdoes not require PRD+ to run -- the company also sells it individually for$9.95.andP;  Thankfully, the program uses less than 1K of memory, since you can'tunload it from memory without rebooting your system.andM;Two other programs, both of which use less than 1K of RAM, give you theability to hit keys sequentially.andP;  STAYDOWN.COM, a utility available on PCMagNet (see the &quot;By Modem&quot; sidebar in the Utilities column for accessinformation), can be unloaded from the command line.andP;  It works only fortwo-keystroke sequences, however, so you're stuck when it comes to softreboots.andM;A shareware product called KeyLock can handle three-keystroke sequences, butit works only with genuine Big Blue BIOSs and can't be unloaded from memorywithout rebooting.andP;  You can get it directly from PC-SIG ($6, plus $4 shippingand handling; 1030 E. Duane, Suite D, Sunnyvale, CA 94086; (408) (30-9291) orfrom the PC-SIG Library CD-ROM.andM;COMPUTERSPEAKandM;With regard to your discussion on Speech Thing in the February 28, 1989, PCAdvisor column, there is a product sold by Forte ($249; 72 Karenlee,Rochester, NY 14618; (716) 427-8595) called the Audio F/X card that alsoallows digital recording and playback.andP;  Additionally, this vendor's cardcomes bundled with music creation/playback software and an easy-to-usesound-effects-generation package.andM;The length of recorded information is limited only by available disk space.andO;Once digitized, the waveforms can be edited, amplified, filtered,time-shifted and added (producing echo), and combined with other prerecordeddata.andP;  Mike McCourt Rochester, New YorkandM;OUTPUT ON THE ROADandM;A while ago I bought a luggable computer and a smallish dot-matrix printer asbackups for my desktop units and to carry with me on trips.andP;  I recentlyreplaced the computer with a laptop, and I'd like to replace the printer withsomething a bit less weighty.andP;  Jim Held Del Mar, CaliforniaandM;Of the truly portable printers available, perhaps the best one to consider isthe Diconix 150 Plus, the latest incarnation of the Diconix 150 ($499 withparallel interface, $519 with serial interface; Diconix Inc., 3100 ResearchBlvd., P.O.andP;  Box 3100, Dayton, OH 45420; (513) 259-3100).andM;This ink jet printer is good for the road because it's small and quiet: itweighs between 3 and 4 pounds, with a footprint of 2 by 6-1/2 by 11 inches(HWD), and emits noise at only 45 decibels.andP;  It operates off C-sizerechargeable batteries and emulates the IBM Proprinter and Quietwriter andthe Epson FX85/100 printers.andM;Of course, the printer probably won't compare favorably with whatever on yourdesk.andP;  It's relatively slow--rated at up to only 180 characters per second indraft mode--and you probably wouldn't want to print your resume on it.andO;You'll also replace ink cartridges more than you'd like, at between $10 and$15 a pop.andM;If you'd rather stick with impact dot matrix technology, Axonix offers the6.5-pound ThinWrite 100, a 9-pin printer with a relatively compact 2.75-by12-by 8-inch footprint ($499; 2257 South 1100 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84106;(801) 466-9797) that operates off either AC or battery power.andP;  Print qualityisn't that of a desktop printer, but it's readable.andM;WORDS ON-DISKandM;Where can I get a dictionary on floppy disks in ASCII format? Richard CoryBrooklyn, New YorkandM;Now that you're ready to abandon your trusty desktop dictionary in favor of asmaller electronic one, you have several choices.andM;If you want a small dictionary to pop up over your applications, then youshould opt for Proximity Technology's Choice Words ($99; 3511 NE 22nd Ave.,andO;Fort Lauderdale, FL 33308; (305) 566-3511), an 80,000-word dictionary and470,000-synonym thesaurus, compliments of Merriam-Webster.andP;  The dictionaryprovides entries broken down by part of speech but doesn't offerpronunciations, and the definitions are more terse--two lines long at themost--than concise.andM;Choice Words eats up only 1.6MB of disk space and 100K of RAM, as opposed tothe 5MB and 128K taken up by Funk andamp; Wagnall's Standard Desk Dictionary fromInductel ($79.95; 18661 McCoy Ave., Saratoga, CA 95070; (800) 367-4497, (408)866-8016).andP;  Inductel's offering gives you 100,000 entries and longerdefinitions, including facts about states and cities around the world,biographical information, a list of common acronyms and abbreviations, and ausage handbook.andM;The package can also be integrated with other reference works in thecompany's Knowledge Acquisition System, which consists of such titles as TheDictionary of Computer Terms and The Dictionary of 26 Languages inSimultaneous Translation.andM;For the serious word cruncher, neither product is much more than a glorifiedspelling checker--the lexicons are too limited.andP;  If words are your life andyou're ready for the CD-ROM plunge, you might consider the $295 MicrosoftBookshelf (Microsoft Corp., 16011 NE 36th Way, Redmond, WA 98073; (206)882-8080), which counts among its reference works The American HeritageDictionary.andM;For a steeper investment of $950, Tri-Star Publishing puts all 12 volumes ofthe OED at your fingertips with The Original Oxford English Dictionary onCompact Disk (475 Virginia, Fort Washington, PA 19034; (800) 872-2828).andO;Reviews of both CD-ROM products appear in &quot;Archives in Miniature,&quot; in theJanuary 31, 1989, issue of PC Magazine.andM;ASK THE ADVISORandM;Send your questions to Advisor, PC Magazine, One Park Avenue, New York, NY10016, or upload to PC MagNet (see the &quot;By Modem&quot; sidebar in the Utilitiescolumn for access information).andP;  Please specify your equipment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
