The action followed months of debate on bringing a multipartysystem to Hungary, where the Communist Party has been the only legalpolitical organization since taking power in 1948.   On Tuesday, the government accepted a proposal from the legalcommittee to present another law regulating operations of newpolitical parties by Aug. 1 rather than next year, as originallyintended.   Until it is passed, two fledgling political parties and dozens ofindependent political groups formed in recent months cannot entercandidates in parliamentary or local council elections.   Speeding action could make competitive, multiparty electionspossible in 1990, when the current parliament's five-year termexpires. A new constitution also is to be proclaimed next year.   Voters were given a choice of candidates in the 1985parliamentary elections, but they were carefully screened.Three-quarters of the deputies in the current parliament areCommunist Party members.   Only six of the 387 deputies voted against the law onassociations and 24 abstained. Seven opposed the law on assembly,which sets rules for demonstrations and rallies, and 16 abstained.   The associations law gives requirements for organizing andregistering independent groups, and in effect allows retroactivelegalization of those already formed.   Some deputies urged the government in Tuesday's debate to abandonthe separate law regulating political parties, contendingassociations and groups should be governed by the same standard.   More orthodox Communist legislators said this would lead toanarchy and parties shouild not even be formed until the lawregulating them was passed.   After the session, Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar told reportersthe Aug. 1 date was a middle ground, ``a compromise in the interestof the whole.''   Until recent efforts for political reform began, Hungary'sparliament often merely validated actions of the Communist Partyleadership. State TV began live broadcasts of some sessions inSeptember, however, and deputies have become more outspoken.   Gyoergy Boecsey, chairman of the legal committee, said setting adate for the party law was ``sufficient guarantee'' of a futuremultiparty system.   The law on assembly gives guidelines for holding demonstrationsand public rallies, and declares holding them to be a fundamentalright. It provides sentences of up to three years in jail for thoseattempting to interfere with that right.   Magyar Hirlap, the governent newspaper, carried comment from someof the new organizations.   Zoltan Biro of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the independentgroup claiming the largest membership, was quoted as saying it is``of primary importance that self-organization take place in a legalframework'' and urging adoption of the political party law ``as soonas possible.''   An unsigned statement attributed to the Alliance of FreeDemocrats said the right of ``free formation of political partiesbelongs to the right of association,'' indicating opposition to aseparate party law.   An independent youth movement, the Federation of Young Democrats,called original versions of the laws ``undemocratic andoverregulated'' and said the final versions guaranteed some ``basichuman rights.''</TEXT></DOC>
