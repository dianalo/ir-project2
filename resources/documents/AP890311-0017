Kennedy Says He Won't Run For Governor, Announces SeparationFrom Wife</HEAD><BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II ended speculation hewould run for Massachusetts governor in 1990, saying he did not wantto campaign while serving his congressional district and caring forhis children.   Kennedy, 36, also announced Friday he was separating from hiswife, Sheilah, and said it was a factor in the decision not to run.   The eldest son of the late Robert F. Kennedy was considered theearly front-runner for the 1990 race to succeed Massachusetts Gov.Michael S. Dukakis.   Kennedy left Boston on Friday for an undisclosed location tospend the weekend in seclusion with his 8-year-old twins, said ChuckMcDermott, the congressman's top aide and long-time friend.   ``This has been a very painful day for me and my family,''Kennedy said in a prepared statement. ``As a father, my principleobligation and deepest personal desire is to assist my childrenthrough the most difficult time in their lives.   ``I also have a commitment to serve the people of the 8thCongressional District. Therefore, I feel it impossible at this timeto take on the added burden of running for another office. To endany further speculation, I wish to make it clear that I do notintend to run for governor.''   Kennedy, the first member of the latest generation of Kennedys toenter politics, instantly became a powerful fixture in Massachusettspolitics when in 1986 he won the House seat held by his uncle, JohnF. Kennedy, and later former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.   Speculation about a gubernatorial run soared when Dukakis, thefailed Democratic presidential nominee, announced in January that hewould not seek a fourth term and Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn said hewould not run for governor.   In a separate statement on his marriage, Kennedy said he and hiswife decided to separate ``only after long and intense efforts tofind another course.''   Kennedy married Sheila Brewster Rauch, a banker's daughter andPhiladelphia Main Line debutante, on Feb. 3, 1979. Mrs. Kennedy, 39,a 1971 graduate of Wheaton College, met Kennedy while she was doinggraduate work at Harvard University.   The couple had their only children, twins, Joseph Patrick KennedyIII and Matthew Rauch Kennedy, on Oct. 4, 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
