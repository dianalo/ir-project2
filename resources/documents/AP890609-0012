The United States, he said, wants ``a change in relations.''   ``We like the Iranian people,'' Bush said, but ``we can't havenormalized relations with a state that is branded a terrorist state.   ``And secondly they must facilitate the release of Americanhostages. That is what it would take.''   The president noted that the speaker of the Iranian Parliament,Hashemi Rafsanjani, has said Iran would use its influence to helpfree nine American hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite Lebanese ifthe United States helped free Shiites taken by Christian militiamenin Beirut. The Iranians made a similar proposal previously.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said earlier in the daythat he was not impressed by Rafsanjani's offer. He said the UnitedStates provided information on the Iranian hostages to Iran in 1982.   Bush said an improvement in relations ``is going to take a changein behavior.''   ``I don't see so far any sign of change,'' he said, adding thathe had ``held out the olive branch'' in his inaugural speech on Jan.20.   His message to Iranian leaders then, as now, was ``You wantbetter relations, do what's right. Do what's right by people who areheld against their will. We see no movement. I repeat that offertonight.''</TEXT></DOC>
