Gilliam Joseph Littlejohn andamp; Levy has proposed acquiring AlleghenyInternational in a deal valued at $703.5 million, of which $662.3million would be in cash.   The offer comes a week after Allegheny International's boardagreed to merge with a corporation formed by the investment firmDonaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette for $698 million, $537.6 million ofwhich would be in cash.   Paul S. Levy, a principal in Gilliam Joseph, said the sale of theSunbeam-Oster division would be necessary for ``a very, very safe''leveraged buyout of Allegheny International.   The company has been operating under protection from itscreditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since earlythis year.   In a leveraged buyout, loans used to buy the company are securedby the company's assets.   Allegheny International management declined comment on the Levyoffer, although management is know to oppose the sale of itsSunbeam-Oster business. Divesting the flagship operation wouldreduce the company to a maker of patio furniture, electric blankets,barbecue grills, weather instruments and bathroom scales.   Levy said the offer would expire on Dec. 1.</TEXT></DOC>
