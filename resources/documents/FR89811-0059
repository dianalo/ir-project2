These four plansare those that Western believes to define the range of alternatives inthe context of the contractual and operational constraints within whichthe CVP operates. These constraints deal with how Western's CVP resourcesare integrated with the Pacific Gas and Electric Company's (PGandamp;E) resourcesand how they are operated to comply with the mandatory water release requirementsof the Bureau of Reclamation (BuRec).The four alternative plans are (1) the Status Quo or No Action alternative_Westernrenews all existing contract rates of delivery (CROD) in the same amountsand with the same Customers, that is, without any changes; (2) the DraftPlan alternative_which calls for a variety of options including renewals,allocations to new Customers, reductions in some programs, and expansionof other programs; (3) the Zero Base alternative_Western allocates theavailable firm power but no renewals would occur and allocations wouldbe zero based; and (4) the Termination alternative_Western allows the contractswith June 30, 1994, or earlier termination dates to expire under theirrespective terms and conditions. None of the four alternatives would affectthe amount of power served under contracts with an expiration date of 2004.However, each alternative would impact, in varying degrees, the cost ofpower served under contracts with an expiration date of 2004.These four alternative plans are described in further detail in a brochurethat will be made available to Customers and interested parties prior tothe first public information forum. The public process will be comprisedof the marketing evaluation and the environmental assessment review ofthe four alternatives pursuant to the NEPA. By combining these two reviews,Western believes that the interests of all parties will be best servedand that the process can be completed in a timely manner.The environmental assessment review of the four alternatives will beginwith a scoping meeting held in conjunction with the first public informationforum. The purpose of this meeting is to describe the four alternativesand the environmental review process, to listen to concerns and questions,and to receive other information from the public. A public comment forumwill be held to receive comments on the scope of the environmental analysisand generally on the four marketing plan alternatives or other alternatives.Written comments will be accepted for up to 30 days after the date of theOctober 20, 1989, public comment forum. The information received from thepublic will help Western to determine the issues and range of alternativesto be analyzed in the environmental assessment, and to prepare the 1994Proposed Power Marketing Plan.To facilitate the public review process, one of the four alternatives,the Draft Plan, is published herein. This Draft Plan is based on the commentsreceived from three informal public meetings held in October 1988, January1989, and February 1989 to solicit Customers' and interested parties' ideasand opinions of the issues and possible directions that Western shouldtake in the development of the 1994 Power Marketing Plan. This alternativecontains the most variations and some of the features of each of the otheralternatives, thereby providing reviewers with more information on whichto evaluate the other three alternatives.The Draft Plan consists of classes of electric service, contract conditions,general allocation and contract principles, eligibility and selection criteria,the marketing of Stampede Powerplant generation, and the Transmission MarketingPlan. The publication of the Draft Plan is not an endorsement of the alternativeby Western. Western will make its choice of a power marketing plan whenit announces the proposed 1994 Power Marketing Plan. The proposed planwill be subject to change by Western, and will be announced after the environmentalassessment is complete.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>The public process will begin on the date of publicationof this notice.

Draft General Allocation and Contract PrinciplesA. 1. Allocations of power will be made in amounts solely determined byWestern.2. The Allottee has the right to purchase such power only upon the executionof a new electric service contract between Western and the Allottee, andsatisfaction of all conditions precedent in that contract.3. The minimum Allocation shall be 500 kW provided that Western may waivethis requirement for preference entities directly connected to Western'stransmission system, which historically have had loads under 500 kW.B. New or renewed Allocations will be sold with energy either provided(a) on an A-over-B basis where A is the CROD and B is the Customer's monthlypeak demand, unless specifically excepted under Contract 2948A and agreedby Western, or (b) pursuant to a Scheduling Agreement where energy entitlementsare based on the Customer's monthly average energy use calculated overthe most recent 5-year period, and recalculated on a 5-year rolling basis,except as mutually agreed by Western and the Customer. Energy providedwith Interruptible Power will be provided in quantities, at rates, andunder other terms and conditions mutually agreed upon between Western andthe Customer.C. Contracts for renewal of Long-Term Firm Power, Type III WithdrawablePower, Interruptible Power, Diversity Power, and Renewable Resource andCogeneration Power:1. To consummate the renewal of any of the above classes of power pursuantto this 1994 Power Marketing Plan, new electric service contracts for sucha service must be executed no later than the expiration date of the existingelectric service contract, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Western.Renewed CROD shall be effective on the effective date of the new electrricservice contract.2. All contracts for a renewal of a Renewable Resource and CogenerationCROD will not include return-energy provisions, However, the new contractshall contain an enabling provision providing for the sale of energy bythe Customer to Western from sources available to the Customer, at market-basedrates, such amounts and rates to be determined and agreed upon from timeto time by the parties' dispatchers. Other terms and conditions for suchan energy sale shall be negotiated.D. To consummate any new Allocation, an electric service contract for suchan Allocation shall be executed within 6 months of a contract offer byWestern, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Western. New Allocationsshall be effective on the later of the effective date of service undera new electric service contract or July 1, 1994.E. Any renewed CROD or new Allocation or part thereof shall cease to existas to the original Customer or Allottee if it is not under contract inthe time period specified in subsections C.I. and D. above, or if a Customer'scontract is terminated prior to December 31, 2004. In either case, Westernwill choose to:1. Not allocate the particular class of service prior to 2004; or2. Allocate the particular class of service at any time in accordance withthe applicable criteria of this 1994 Power Marketing Plan to any qualifyingapplicant.F. In the event that Type III Withdrawable Power or Interruptible Poweris reduced to zero, such power may be reinstated in accordance with theterms of the contract, and the contract shall continue to exist throughits term unless terminated by either party.<ITAG tagnum="81">G. For New Renewable Resource and Cogeneration Power</ITAG>1. To be effective, an executed contract will be contingent upon the developmentand commerical operation of a specific project. In the event that the originalproject does not meet this condition precedent, then Western will considerallowing a Customer to replace the original project with an alternate renewableresource or cogeneration project. The alternate project must comply withthe intent and criteria of the renewable resource and cogeneration programof the 1994 Power Marketing Plan.2. The scheduled operation date of any planned generation project, as certifiedby a registered professional engineer, shall be within 3 years of the publicationdate of the Final Allocations. Failure of a project to begin commercialoperation within this time period, as determined by Western, will giveWestern the option, upon giving 6-months' advance written notice to theAllottee, to rescind the Allocation. Allocations under contract shall notbecome effective until the first day of the month following commercialoperation of the project.3. Demonstration projects will not be considered.4. All new contracts for Renewable Resource and Cogeneration Power shallcontain an enabling provision providing for the sale of energy by the Customerto Western from sources available to the Customer, at market-based rates,such amounts and rates to be determined and agreed upon from time to timeby the parties' dispatchers. Other terms and conditions for such an energysale shall be negotiated.<ITAG tagnum="81">H. Scheduling Agreements</ITAG>Western will encourage and enter into Scheduling Agreements with its Customerswhen advantageous to Western's customer base as a whole and when consistentwith applicable law or when required in accordance with the normal utilitypractice of interconnected utilities. Western may condition its enteringinto a Scheduling Agreement upon satisfactory resolution of issues relatedto interconnected operations, including use of transmission capacity, voltagesupport, power factor, reactive powerflow, system operations, and modificationsof facilities.<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Consolidation of Contract Rates of Delivery</ITAG>Western will normally contract with each individual Customer. However,Western will enter into consolidated or combined delivery contracts witha group of Customers or with a representative of a group of Customers whenadvantageous to Western's customer base as a whole and when consistentwith applicable law.VI. Eligibility and Selection Criteria<ITAG tagnum="81">A.

Western has determined that (1) this rulemakingrelates to service offered by Western, and therefore is not a rule withinthe purview of the Act; (2) there will be only a few qualifying applicants,which will be small entities; and (3) the impacts of an allocation fromWestern would not cause an adverse economic impact to such entities. Therequirements of the Act can be waived if the head of the agency certifiesthat the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. By his execution of this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, the Administrator certifies that no significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities will occur. <ITAG tagnum="84">Determination Under Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The DOE has determined that the 1994 Power Marketing Plan alternativesand allocation criteria are not major rules because they do not meet thecriteria of section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291, 46 FR 13193 (February19, 1981). Western has an exemption from sections 3, 4, and 7 of ExecutiveOrder 12291; accordingly, no clearance of this procedure by Office of Managementand Budget is required. <ITAG tagnum="21">Issued at Golden, Colorado, July 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William H.
