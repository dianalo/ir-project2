The attack comes just one day after the armed forces said it wasbeginning a three-month cease-fire in the conflict with the rebels.   Guerrillas attacked just before sunset, firing four anti-tankrockets at the state-owned ANTEL telephone switching station in SanRamon, on the northwestern edge of the city.   The attack on the telephone facility, which caused no casualtiesand slight damage to a brick wall, appeared to be diversonary.   Minutes later, about 10 blocks away, a firefight erupted at theSan Ramon Civil Defense post, where about 20 soldiers were stationed.   Several dozen soldiers from the 1st ArmyBbrigade on duty nearbyadvanced toward the post and the exchange escalated into a fiercebattle that lasted for nearly an hour.   Panicked residents threw themselves on the ground behind walls,parked vehicles and piles of bricks and cinderblock at a masonrysupply business along the route of the soldiers' advance.   ``Commie dogs! Show yourselves, cowards!'' shouted some of thesoldiers as they advanced, running crouched and pausing every fewyards to survey the scene, aim and fire.   An air force helicopter flew over the battle, but did not openfire.   Journalists saw at least three dead soldiers being loaded onto atruck. Two civilians, one of them an adolescent boy, also werekilled.   ``There are lots of dead,'' said one young soldier to ajournalist.   Several soldiers were wounded, but there was no official count asof Thursday night.   There was no immediate indication of guerrilla casualties.   Earlier Thursday, leftist rebels said the army is violating itsown cease-fire by moving into territory controlled by the guerrillas.   ``That demonstrates the falsehood of the supposed cease-fire,''said the insurgents' clandestine Radio Venceremos.   A top colonel said the army has ``the legal and moralobligation'' to defend against guerrilla attacks despite thecease-fire.   Radio Venceremos did not mention fighting as a result of armytroop movements in the northern zones of Morazan, San Miguel andChalatenango provinces. It only said the army had physically enteredrebel territory.   The northern sectors of the three provinces are dominated byleftist rebels waging a 9-year-old revolution against theU.S.-backed government.   The armed forces on Wednesday began what they said was athree-month cessation of offensive operations designed to provideconditions for peace talks. The government of President JoseNapoleon Duarte has called on the rebels to respond in kind.   The rebels said Wednesday they were willing to declare acease-fire once a time, place and agenda for peace talks is agreedupon.   The guerrillas have said they will participate in and respect theoutcome of this year's presidential election if it is postponed fromMarch 19 until September.   The guerrillas have accused the government of procrastinating inresponse to their peace overture.   ``The government and armed forces have lacked seriousness in theway they have dealt with our proposal and the expectations it hascreated. That could harm prospects for a good outcome of the searchfor peace,'' the rebel broadcast said Thursday.   The U.S. State Department said the rebels' refusal to declare aunilateral cease-fire called into question the sincerity of theirstated desire for peace.   The rebels have continued attacks. They wounded three NationalGuardsmen Wednesday night in an assault in Tejutepeque, in thenorthern province of Cabanas.   ``A cease-fire does not mean the armed forces relinquishes itsconstitutional duty of defending sovereignty and ensuring security,tranquility and stability,'' Col. Mauricio Vargas, commander of theeastern region, said in a televised interview Wednesday night.   ``If people are up in arms in any part of the nation's territory,we have the legal and moral obligation to fight them,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
