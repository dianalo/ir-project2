Wayne Calloway, chairman and chief executive.   The Puchase, N.Y.-based company said it earned $264.9 million,or $1 a share, in the three months ended June 17 compared with$219.6 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier.   Second-quarter revenue rose 23.8 percent to $3.59 billion from$2.9 billion a year earlier.   The latest results included an after-tax credit of $15 millionfor several one-time events, the largest of which was a decision tokeep rather than sell a foreign bottling operation.   The operating profit from the company's soft drink businesssoared 60 percent to $239.6 million while sales rose 33 percent to$1.5 billion.   Excluding one-time events and the net effect of bottlingacquisitions, operating profits still rose 32 percent and salesrose 9 percent.   The growth in operating profits reflected strong domesticresults, due to volume growth, higher pricing and efforts tocontrol costs, the company said.   It said its Diet Pepsi and Mountain Dew brands posteddouble-digit growth in case sales in the United States.   The snack foods business had an operating profit of $191.7million, up 24 percent from a year earlier, on a 17 percent revenueincrease to $958 million. Its domestic profits rose at adouble-digit pace while international profits more than tripled.   The company said domestic volume for Frito-Lay rose 8 percentled by gains in the Ruffles, Fritos and Doritos brands.   The company's restaurant business earnings rose 15 percent to$102.1 million, while sales rose 20 percent to nearly $1.2 billion.   Earnings were up 41 percent to $51.8 million at the Pizza Hutrestaurants and 60 percent to $32.4 million at Taco Bellrestuarants, but fell 44 percent to $17.9 million at Kentucky FriedChicken.   The decline at Kentucky Fried Chicken was blamed on an $8million charge for consolidating its field operations, higher costsfor chicken and labor and lower customer counts.   For the first six months, Pepsico earned $430 million, or $1.62per share, up 29.2 percent from $332.9 million, or $1.27 a share, ayear earlier.
