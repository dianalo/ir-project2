The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 11.92 to 473.05, a 2.6%gain that left it within striking distance of its October1989 high of 485.73.</LP><TEXT>   Among market sectors, a record high was achieved by theNasdaq Industrial Index, which includes manytechnology-related stocks, in a 15.24-point leap to 530.69.The Nasdaq Transportation Index flirted with its record highof 509.93 in a 10.16 jump to 507.58. The Nasdaq Utility Indexrose 14.95 to 575.33.   Volume surged to 224.9 million shares, Nasdaq's seventhbusiest day in history, from 149.8 million Monday. Advancingstocks swamped decliners, 1,439 to 642.   Among the 221 issues shooting to new highs was Microsoft,which jumped 4 1/2 to 111 1/2. Other prominent issues alsohit new 52-week highs: Apple Computer leaped 4 3/4 to 63 1/8;and medical device maker St. Jude Medical rose 1 1/2 to 47.Only 12 issues fell to new lows.   Mutual funds ignited the rally with their continuingdemand for smaller stocks, said L. Keith Mullins, MorganStanley emerging growth analyst. &quot;We're seeing a lot of black{or buy} tickets from mutual funds,&quot; he said, adding thatindividuals seem to be switching their investments tosmall-stock funds from the safer-but-stolid money marketfunds. &quot;Individual investors always have been attracted tothis area,&quot; he said. &quot;I think they want more action than whatthey're being provided in a 5% yield in money market fund.&quot;   Institutional traders at Cowen andamp; Co. and Needham andamp; Companysaid buying was heavy among funds. &quot;Toward the end of the{fiscal} quarter, people want to stick with their winners,&quot;said Jerry Newman of Cowen. &quot;Companies are continuing to showgood earnings and new products and people want to be in theleading groups,&quot; said Gary Rosenbach of Needham.   Now, however, isn't the time to commit new capital tosmaller stocks, cautioned Mr. Mullins. Although attractive inthe long term, the shares of many emerging growth and smallercompanies now look overpriced based on their expectedearnings, he said. The average price-to-earnings multipleamong 135 stocks in Morgan Stanley's Emerging Growth Indexhas leaped to 25 times trailing earnings from 17 in October-- the second sharpest expansion this decade, said Mr.Mullins, who expects the rally to fade.   &quot;I think we've got great companies with wonderfulprospects,&quot; he added, &quot;but I bet I get to buy them cheaper&quot;later in the year.   Computer and medical-related stocks soared amid prospectsfor glamorous new products or wonder drugs. Apple Computerrose after the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker unveiled anew system designed to make its Macintosh computers morecompatible with International Business Machine Corp.'scomputers.   Seagate Technology jumped 1 1/8 to 15 7/8. The ScottsValley, Calif., company announced three new disk drives.   Novell surged 2 3/8 to 51 1/2. The San Jose, Calif.,computer networking company introduced a new network monitoravailable for $2,495.   Adobe Systems vaulted 3 1/4 to 49 3/4. The Mountain View,Calif., maker of graphics software introduced a new typefacetechnology designed to boost electronic publishing.Separately, Adobe signed a licensing and distributionagreement with Digital Equipment Corp. for more than 1,000fonts from its Adobe Type Library.   Adobe has its doubters, however, who are mindful of thestock's 15 1/4-point plunge last May to 35 1/4 after thecompany warned of disappointing earnings. &quot;Business isstrong, but not that strong,&quot; analyst Peter D. Schlieder, ofWessels, Arnold andamp; Henderson in Minneapolis, said in recentcomments to his sales force. At 22 times analysts' expectedearnings of $2.20 a share for fiscal 1991 ending in November,the stock fully reflects investors' optimism that Adobe willbecome an industry standard for graphics software, he said.   Recent selling by some of the company's insiders alsoraises some caution flags for Mark Cohodes of Rocker PartnersLtd. of New York. Adobe Chairman and Co-founder John E.Warnock in January sold 100,000 shares at an average price of$31.05 apiece. Mr. Cohodes also says that in the near term heexpects the company's royalties to be flat or lower and saysprice competition among low-cost printers will pressureAdobe's profit margins.   Roger McNamee, however, of T. Rowe Price Associates'Science andamp; Technology Fund, said he is confident Adobe'ssoftware will become the industry standard. Adobe's sharescomprise about 7% of his fund.   Medical-related stocks joined in the rally. Synergenjumped 3 1/4 to 38 1/2. The Boulder, Colo., biotechnologycompany said it obtained a patent for a product to be used asa treatment for peripheral neuropathies, which is pain in theextremities caused by nerve damage.   Immunex rose 2 to 52 1/2. Late yesterday, the Seattlebiotechnology company announced that the Food and DrugAdministration cleared for marketing its drug, Leukine, whichpromotes the growth of infection-fighting white blood cells.   SciMed Life Systems rose 2 1/2 to 49. Hambrecht andamp; Quistanalyst Kurt Kruger was bullish on the stock based on hisoptimism about the company's new Express catheter used incardiovascular procedures. The product puts the Maple Grove,Minn., company firmly in competition with a unit of Eli Lillyandamp; Co., the leading maker of angioplasty devices used incardiovascular procedures.   The day's biggest loser was Health Risk Management, arelative newcomer to the public market. Shares of theMinneapolis provider of health-care management servicesplunged 5 7/8 to 12 3/8 after Health Risk cautioned investorsabout its earnings outlook for fiscal 1991, which ends inJune. Health Risk, which had an initial public offering inDecember at $11 a share, said revenue will be lower thanexpected because some of its clients have brought fewercompanies into the company's programs than planned.   Merisel, a maker of wholesale computer products, slipped7/8 to 3 after the company reported that fourth-quarterearnings tumbled to two cents a share from 27 cents a yearearlier. Merisel said the figures reflect its 1990 mergerwith Microamerica. Separately, Merisel said it hasn'tcomplied with certain covenants in its loan agreements, butis negotiating with lenders to amend certain provisions.</TEXT></DOC>
