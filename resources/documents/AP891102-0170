Spokeswoman Nancy Myers said the ads were rejected by eightVirginia-area stations, including five that are airing opposing adsproduced by the National Abortion Rights Action League.   The rejected ads attack Virginia Democratic nominee DouglasWilder, who has made his opposition to restrictions on abortion acentral focus of his campaign along with his contention thatRepublican opponent Marshall Coleman wants to take away women'srights to choose. The ads endorse Coleman.   The election is Tuesday.   Ms. Myers contended that the ads were factual and said officialsat the stations gave ``outrageous reasons'' for refusing them.Among the reasons, she said, was that they objected to the tone ofthe narrator's voice, in one case, and to an assertion thatWilder's campaign was based on the abortion issue.   ``These stations are saying that we can't talk about the issueof abortion unless we use the other side's terminology andrhetoric,'' she said. ``That's television censorship, and it'soutrageous.''   A third ad describing Coleman's opposition to abortion has beenaccepted by several of the stations, as have general ads on theabortion issue that do not directly address the Virginia governor'srace, said executive director David O'Steen.   John Long, executive vice president and general manager of WJLAin Washington, said his television station rejected the ads becausethe group had not provided substantiation ``to our satisfaction''for their assertions.   ``There's just an awful lot of inference, too much inference, inthose spots,'' Long said. ``We've asked them to substantiate. Wheredo they get those facts? ... If they supply the facts, we'll putthem on the air.''   Ms. Myers said the group intended to spend $150,000 airing theads. Because of the refusal, she said, they will probably air$100,000 worth. The ads are being aired on seven stations plus somecable-only stations, she said.   The abortion-rights group, NARAL, has aired $300,000 worth ofads attacking Coleman's anti-abortion position, spokeswoman LorettaUcelli said.   She said the abortion-rights group was refused airtime on someWashington stations that reject advocacy-group ads in general, andthat other stations required written substantiation of the factsstated in the ads.   ``We went through the process and they accepted them,'' Ms.Ucelli said.</TEXT></DOC>
