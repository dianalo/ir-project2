Introduction</ITAG>On December 23, 1988, the participants in the Consolidated Tape Association(``CTA'') and Consolidated Quotation System (``CQS'') submitted amendments1<NOTE/> to the Plan governing the operation of the consolidated quotationreporting system (``CQ Plan'') and the Plan governing the operation ofthe consolidated transaction reporting plan (``CTA Plan''). The amendmentswere noticed in Release No. 34-26509 on February 1, 1989, and the Commissionreceived one comment in response thereto.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The amendments to the Plans were submitted pursuant toRule 11Aa-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(4)empowers the Commission to summarily put into effect on a temporary basisa Plan amendment ``if the Commission finds that such action is necessaryor appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investorsor the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to,and perfect mechanisms of, a national market system or otherwise in furtheranceof the purposes of the Act.'' The Plan amendments were also submitted toRule 11Aa3-1 under the Act.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Description of the Amendment and Plan Participants' Rationale</ITAG>The purpose of the Amendments is to revise Schedule A-3 of Exhibit D tothe CTA Plan and Schedule A-3 of Exhibit F to the CQ Plan to increase theNetwork B \2\<NOTE/> non-member last sale and bid/ask interrogation unit subscriberfees by one dollar each. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ ``Network B'' refers to the consolidated data stream representingtransaction and quotation data on eligible securities thatr are listedon the American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') or that are traded on regionalexchanges but substantially meet the Amex listing standards.The participants stated that Network B is increasing its non-member lastsale and bid/ask subscriber fees to ensure that Network B participantsare able to meet the increasing costs of administering the disseminationof Network B equity market data. They believe that the increase in thenon-member fees will more accurately reflect the higher costs of approvingbilling and collecting monies owed Network B by non-member subscribers.\3\<NOTE/> The participants believe that the amendments fulfill theNational Market System objectives of dissemination of trading data on termswhich are unreasonably discriminatory and thus are consistent with Section11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ According to the participants, the current number andgrowth rate of non-member subscribers greatly exceeds that of member subscribers.Because higher administrative costs are attributable to the increase innon-member subscribers, the participants believe that it is appropriatefor non-members to bear an increase in subscriber fees to meet these highercosts.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Comments</ITAG>As noted above, the Commission received one comment letter from the InformationIndustry Association (``IIA''). The IIA made no substantive comments withrespect to the amendments.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The IIA's only comment concerned the Commission's decisionto make the Amendment summarily effective. The association was concernedabout the lack of opportunity to comment on the fee change before it wasput into effect. In addition, the IIA requested that the Commission routinelyextend the statutorily mandated comment period. IIA stated that a 21-daycomment period does not afford trade associations, such as the IIA, sufficienttime to review regulatory proposals or develop policy positions.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion</ITAG>Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(2) under the Act requires that the Commission approve anamendment to an effective national market system plan if it finds thatthe amendment is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for theprotection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets,to remove the impediments to and perfect the mechanism of, a national marketsystem, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Section11A(a)(1)(c)(iii) of the Act states that ``[i]t is in the public interestand appropriate for the protection of investors and the maintenance offair and orderly markets to assure * * * the availability to brokers, dealers,and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactionsin securities.'' As a general matter, these standards require that feescharged under the CTA and CQ plans be fair and reasonable. The Commissionbelieves the amendments meet these standards.The Network B non-member last sale and bid/ask interrogation unit subscriberfees are existing fees collected on behalf of all Plan participants foraccess to, or use of, facilities contemplated by the CTA and CQ Plans.The participants sought to amend these existing fees and to have the amendmentsput into effect summarily upon publication on a temporary basis not toexceed 120 days, pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(4) under the Act. The Commissiongranted such temporary effectiveness and then solicited comments to determinewhether to grant permanent effectiveness.The current number of non-member subscribers, as well as the growth rateof this group of subscribers, far exceeds that of member subscribers. TheCommission believes that if higher administrative costs are associatedwith increased utilization by non-member subscribers, it is appropriatethat these subscribers incur an increase in fees to cover these costs.The Commission believes that the increases in the Network B non-memberlast sale and bid/ask subscriber fees are a legitimate attempt to enablethe participants to meet their increased costs of administering the disseminationof Network B equity market data. Moreover, the Commission finds that theincrease of one dollar for each fee for non-member subscribers is not unreasonablydiscriminatory and therefore complies with section 11A(c)(1) of the Act.Thus, the Commission finds that making these fee increases a permanentpart of the CTA and CQS Network B fee structures is fair and reasonable,and is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protectionof investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to removeimpediments to, and perfect the mechanism, a national market system, orotherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds the amendments tothe CTA and CQS Network B fee schedules to be consistent with the Act,particularly Section 11A(a)(1) and Rules 11Aa3-1 and 11Aa3-2.It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 11A of the Act, that the amendmentsto the CTA and CQ Plans be, and hereby are, approved.<ITAG tagnum="20">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
