In a statement yesterday afternoon, the executive committee of the NFL Management Council said it wouldn't agree to binding arbitration and wouldn't freeze rosters for the rest of the year, which would mean dropping all the players currently on the so-called &quot;replacement&quot; teams being fielded during the strike. Instead, they offered a two-game salary guarantee for returning players.    &quot;I don't know that it's necessarily the last chapter,&quot; said Dick Berthelsen, the union's general counsel, of the owners' negative response. &quot;Management doesn't bargain each week until they see the body count&quot; -- how many players cross the picket lines.    The owners did agree to other elements of the proposal released late Monday by union chief Gene Upshaw: protection for union representatives for the remainder of the season, and continuation of the 1982 collective bargaining agreement until a new contract is signed. They also agreed to mediation, which they had requested some time ago, but insisted in their statement that &quot;all unresolved issues must be resolved through the collective bargaining process.&quot; The union had proposed submitting unresolved issued to binding arbitration.    A spokesman for the Management Council, the owners' labor negotiating arm, said that in a phone conversation yesterday, Mr. Upshaw asked Jack Donlan, executive director of the Management Council, whether owners would accept binding arbitration on just the free-agency issue. Mr. Donlan rejected the suggestion, the spokesman said.    The spokesman also said the league's owners are committed to playing with their current replacement rosters for the rest of the season, including the Super Bowl, if necessary. That may be the case, if Mr. Upshaw can be taken at his word. He has said that the players will remain on strike &quot;for the duration&quot; if the union's offer was rejected.    However, no one is certain that the bulk of union membership, which is said to be bitterly divided about the strike, will continue to sacrifice hefty weekly paychecks in order to win their battle for free agency and increased pensions and benefits.    The next test of the union's resolve will come this afternoon. Players who don't report to camp before 1 p.m. Eastern time won't be eligible for this week's games. So far, nearly 160 of the union's 1,585 members have crossed the picket lines and returned to work, a Management Council spokesman estimated. </TEXT></DOC>
