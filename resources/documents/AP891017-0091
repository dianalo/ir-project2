Officials said 91 companies from 14 countries have displays atthe five-day exhibition, down from about 260 firms from more than20 countries at the last one in 1987.   The United States and other Western nations imposed embargoes onarms sales to China after the June military crackdown onpro-democracy dissent, and all military equipment seen on displaywas Chinese.   China, which last year sold an estimated $1.9 billion in arms,almost all to the Third World, exhibited models of fighter planes,training jets, missiles and launching systems and booster rockets.   U.S. Ambassador to China James Lilley attended the openingceremonies and U.S. companies, including Boeing, McDonnell Douglas,Lockheed, Allied-Signal and Rockwell, had large displays. BritishAerospace, Airbus Industrie, Dassault, Rolls Royce and Aerospatialewere also among the major exhibitors.   Most agreed that sales to China had been affected by thepolitical turmoil and sharp spending cuts as the government triesto rein in excessive economic growth and inflation.   ``China has major problems with foreign exchange and when thereare political uncertainties it's difficult for companies to getfunds,'' said an official of one U.S. company. Business prospects``have been put back at least a year,'' he said.   ``There is a tendency for things to slow down,'' said R.L.Wintringer of Lockheed. But the commitment of the Chinese to expandtheir aviation industry is still there, and ``we're going tostay,'' he said.   The Civil Aviation Administration of China operates 210 largeand medium-size airliners from 93 domestic airports and plans tobuy 90 jetliners in the next five years, providing majoropportunities for foreign aviation companies.   ``It's a very competitive market and we've got a presencehere,'' said an official for British Aerospace about his company'sparticipation in the show. The British firm has already sold 10medium-range BAE 146s to China.   The Soviet Union, which is actively seeking more trade withChina following the normalization of bilateral relations this year,had a large exhibit, including models of planes and helicopters,instruments, ejection escape systems and even a space suit.   An official of the Soviet Ministry of Aviation Industry said hiscountry is not trying to take advantage of China's strainedrelations with the West. ``Our trade will not be at the cost of theWest,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
