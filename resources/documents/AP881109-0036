Thomas Guidoboni, the lawer for Robert Morris Jr., said Tuesdayhe hasn't been contacted by the FBI since informing the bureau thathe was representing the 23-year-old Morris.   ``The ball's in their (the FBI's) court, we're waiting to hearfrom them,'' said Guidoboni.   Prior to the Morris family's retaining Guidoboni, the bureau hadsought to question the student, said his father, Robert Morris Sr.of Arnold, Md.   Guidoboni said he didn't think ``we'll have enough information bythe end of this week'' to determine whether to talk to the FBI andthat he wants to talk more with his client before deciding whatcourse of action to take.   The possibility of seeking grand jury subpoenas or a searchwarrant for data at Cornell that could shed light on the computervirus incident was considered Tuesday within the FBI. It wasdiscarded as being unnecessary and then revived in discussions withJustice Department lawyers, said the sources, speaking on conditionof anonymity.   M. Stuart Lynn, the university's vice president for informationtechnologies, reiterated that Cornell will cooperate fully with theinvestigation.   The virus paralyzed more than 6,000 university and militarycomputers nationwide last Wednesday and Thursday.   A computer virus is a tiny program that invades data processorsand disrupts normal operation of the machines. A virus duplicatesitself, spreading into other programs in the computer and infectingone computer after another as users share floppy disks or link upover telephone lines.   The virus last week apparently rapidly duplicated itself, therebyslowing computers' processing speed and taking up their memory space.</TEXT></DOC>
