CarrollStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> IBM MSFTCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><DATELINE> LAS VEGAS, Nev.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   International Business Machines Corp. said it will start shipping a new type of operating system software next month, finally opening the way for the next generation of personal computer software applications.    The operating system, which controls the computer's basic functions, will let software companies start offering products that are far larger and more complex than existing application software. It also means that users will be able to have several programs running simultaneously -- say, having a program monitoring stock prices at the same time someone is using word processing software.    The announcement wasn't a surprise even though IBM had promised in April only that it would deliver the OS/2 software by the first quarter of 1988, which, in the computer industry, typically would mean the end of the first quarter. The report was also a long time coming, given that the OS/2 is designed to take advantage of the capabilities of the IBM AT, a computer that was introduced more than three years ago. And it may be more than a year before truly advanced software programs are available for the new system.    Still, the announcement is a milestone for the personal computer industry, which is gathered here this week for the annual fall Comdex trade show. Together with statements IBM made yesterday on which enhanced versions of OS/2 will be available, the announcement also provides a timetable for the industry to take advantage of the new operating system.    IBM's statement &quot;dispels a lot of the rumors, the questions. Now people can get busy writing software,&quot; said Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, an industry newsletter. &quot;I think it's great.&quot;    Some software that uses OS/2 is being shown here this week, and more will be announced by the time IBM begins shipping the operating system, developed jointly with Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash. Still, it will be months before many of those products are delivered and it will be at least late next year before much important new software appears that uses OS/2.    The early applications will just be existing programs that will be adapted to the new operating system. Philippe Kahn, president of Borland International Ltd., said yesterday that a change to the new operating system will improve the performance of his Paradox database product by 20%, and other software companies expect similar or even larger improvements in the speed of running the programs.    But David Readerman, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., said he thinks it will be early 1989 before &quot;breakthrough&quot; applications appear that make customers run out and buy OS/2 and the hardware required to run it. He said software companies first need to get their hands on the version of OS/2 that includes the Presentation Manager, a new user interface that makes applications easier to handle. IBM said yesterday that the Presentation Manager will be shipped next October, and it can take many months to bring application software to market.    IBM said yesterday that the &quot;extended edition&quot; of OS/2 that uses the new interface will be shipped next November, so applications using it won't appear until well into 1989. The &quot;extended&quot; version of OS/2 includes features that make it far easier for personal computers to talk to mainframes and extract data from them. It was promised at IBM's April announcement of its new line of personal computers and is a major feature of IBM's push to lock up the corporate market.    To smooth the industry's move toward the &quot;extended&quot; version, Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM announced yesterday that it would start shipping an early version of it next July. That version, which IBM hadn't previously disclosed, won't have the new interface.    IBM also announced that it will produce a new generation of software, based on OS/2, that will manage the interaction of computers connected in a local area network.    IBM and Microsoft said they hope that applications using its various new products will appear more quickly than in the past because the two companies have been working with software companies to help them develop products. In addition, IBM gave the developers preliminary copies of much of the operating system software many months ago.    Whenever they appear, the applications will finally bring to a head a simmering war of words between IBM and its competitors, notably Compaq Computer Corp. of Houston. IBM has been saying it thinks the new software will run faster on its new line of computers than on competitors', but Compaq and others have said IBM was just blowing smoke. Because of the complexity of the technology, it hasn't been possible to test the rival claims.    IBM shares closed yesterday at $121.875, off $2.625, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
