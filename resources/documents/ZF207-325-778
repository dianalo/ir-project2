Zachmann It has been just 6 months since I wrote (&quot;IBM at War withthe world,&quot; January 31, 1989) that the battle between IBM's Micro Channelarchitecture and the Extended Industry Standard Architecture sponsored byAST, Compaq, Epson, Hewlett-Packard, NEC, Olivetti, Tandy, Wyse, and Zenithwas &quot;likely to be the single most important hardware conflict of 1989.&quot;andM;A flurry of press accounts early this spring suggested that IBM might begaining ground with its MCA.andP;  Articles in the trade press, subsequentlypicked up by the national business press, saw apparent gains for MCA.andM;As the year wears on, evidence mounts, and reasons increase to expect thatEISA, not MCA, will prove victorious in the struggle to define the hardwarefoundation for the next era of industry-standard personal computing.andM;MCA's MUSCLEandM;A good starting point is to examine the appearance of strength for MCA andthe reality behind it.andP;  First of all, it has been claimed that MCA is a lotfurther along than EISA.andP;  MCA was introduced with the IBM PS/2 line (andOS/2) in April of 1987.andP;  Close to 3 million MCA machines will be installed bythe end of 1989, while EISA machines have yet to ship.andM;The problem, however, is that the vast majority of the MCA-bus PS/2s sold sofar haven't got the real MCA bus in them and never will.andP;  That's because theyare 16-bit systems, which will never take advantage of the updated 32-bitversion of the MCA bus that is necessary to make real use of high-speedperipherals and bus mastering.andP;  Those IBM PS/2 Models 50, 50-Z, and 60 with a16-bit MCA bus are no more capable of making practical use of high-speed busmastering than are the even more numerous PS/2 Models 25, 30, and 30/286,which haven't got an MCA bus at all.andP;  The original 32-bit versions of the MCAin PS/2 Models 70 and 80 are likely, at best, to require costly upgradesbefore they can make use of anything the real Micro Channel architecture hasto offer.andM;It should have been apparent to anybody who bothered to look at the originalMCA spec that the five reserved pins on the 16-bit section and the additional16 reserved pins on the 32-bit portion of the bus weren't there just tooccupy space.andP;  The original MCA, like the original IBM 370 Model 155 and 165mainframes introduced in 1970, was never meant to be &quot;the real thing.&quot;andM;IBM subsequently introduced the &quot;real&quot; 370 mainframes with dynamic addresstranslation and demand-page virtual storage only after lots of customers hadbought the original 370/155 and 165.andP;  Those lucky early customers weregenerously offered an expensive DAT (dynamic address translation)modification.andM;In the case of MCA, the 16-bit PS/2s don't even have the possibility ofupgrading to the &quot;real&quot; MCA, Model 50, 50-Z, and 60 buyers have the privilegeof knowing that, rather than buying the path to the future, they were simplybuying a nonstandard 16-bit personal computer that couldn't even run as fastas old-fashioned AT-compatible systems with comparable speed processors anddisks.andM;Under all the hype, the &quot;real&quot; MCA (with true 32-bit performance and usablebus-mastering capabilities) is little more than an upward-compatiblemigration path for the 3 million or so MCA-based PS/2s sold thus far.andP;  EISA,on the other hand, provides a true 32-bit upward-compatible path for nearly30 million AT and compatible systems already in place.andM;TIPPING THE SCALESandM;Aside from MCA's so called 2-year &quot;head start&quot; over EISA, there is littleobjective basis on which to claim any real advantage for MCA.andP;  Functionallyand technically, neither the inherently 32-bit EISA nor the true 32-bit MCAhas any compelling advantage over the other.andP;  Both provide the substantialperformance advantages of a 32-bit bus, bus-mastering capabilities, andautomatic recognition in hardware for cards inserted into a system.andM;To the extent that there are any technical advantages, they tend to work infavor of EISA.andP;  MCA boards are smaller than EISA boards, and less power isprovided to the board.andP;  This carries a slight advantage because you can putMCA boards into a smaller chassis.andP;  It has a much greater disadvantage,however, because it will certainly mean that a larger and more diverse rangeof EISA boards will be built than MCA boards.andM;The smaller size and lower power of the MCA require a board-market to developspecialized chips and to use surface-mount technology for an MCA board.andP;  Ofcourse, surface-mount chips and ASICs can and will be used with many EISAboards as well, but they aren't as essential as they are with MCA.andP;  Thus,EISA boards generally require a smaller investment to develop than MCA boardsdo.andM;EISA boards can be more easily constructed with standard components.andO;Specialized boards that aren't likely to sell in large quantities can bedesigned far more easily for EISA than for MCA.andP;  The result will be a muchwider selection of EISA boards than MCA boards.andM;Most important of all, not only is MCA's head start deceptive, but EISA isactually well ahead of MCA in critical areas.andP;  Standard chip sets to supporttrue 32-bit bus mastering for EISA are already available from Intel.andO;Comparable chips for true 32-bit MCA systems with bus mastering are stilllittle more than vaporware outside of IBM.andM;Add to all this the disadvantages to other vendors of IBM's proprietarycontrol over MCA, the advantages to users of the more intense competitionthat a standardized open architecture like EISA provides, and the growingnumber of announcements of EISA systems, cards, and software, and the sumequals deep trouble for IBM's MCA and growing success for EISA.andM;Mark my words: By this time next year, there won't be any doubt that EISA iswell ahead of MCA in the battle to define the direction for industry-standardpersonal computing in the early 1990s.andP;  Nor will there be any doubt that EISAsystems, boards, and software are leading the way to new levels of functionand performance in PCs and network servers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
