(radio-based meter-readingnetworks)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Desmond, Paul.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Utilities such as Boston Edison Co, Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co andSouthern California Edison Co are testing radio-basedmeter-reading networks which offer diagnostic and customer usagedata and permit central monitoring of thousands of circuits,transformers and capacitors.andP;  The networks will help the utilitiesslow energy waste and institute equitable billing systems.andP;  Thenetworks are based on spread-spectrum radio technology andadvanced digital meters.andP;  They support time-of-use billing, whichallows utilities to charge more for electricity during peak usagehours.andP;  Southern California Edison's network is furthest along,with the capacity to support about 1,000 electric meters and 250radios.andP;  The cost of installation for Southern California Edisonis estimated at between $150 to $200 per home.andP;  When that cost iscompared to the 50 cents a month that it costs to send a personout to read a meter, it is clear that the net must accomplish morethan remote meter-reading to be cost-justifiable.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     UtilitiesNetworksRemote ControlMeter ReadingEnergy ManagementRadio CommunicationCustomer Relations.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
