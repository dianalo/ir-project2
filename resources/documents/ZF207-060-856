 This column addresses security issues surroundingnon-network computer access.andP;  It contains suggestions for preventing the &quot;badguys&quot; from ever entering your system.andM;Last November's Internet penetration, though it raised many eyebrows, was notnearly as serious as it could have been.andP;  While the invading program didindeed become the superuser, it did not abuse its privileges beyond trying toreplicate itself.andP;  It obviously could have read or written any file on any ofthe 6000 systems it penetrated.andP;  Had it been sneaky enough, it could havelain low for quite a period of time and insinuated itself into the system inany number of terrible ways.andM;The worst-case scenario would have been a covert penetration.andP;  Covertpenetrations are particularly insidious, because the victim doesn't even knowany damage has been done.andP;  In thevery worst cases, the victim never finds outthe penetration has occurred--the intruder just takes whatever he or shewants, then disappears without a trace.andM;If you want perfect security for your computer, you'll have to take a lessonfrom the government.andP;  First, you'll need total physical security--includingarmed guards, protected tapes, and of course, secure machine rooms.andP;  You'llhave to ensure that not one single person or bit can touch your computerwithout your prior authorization.andP;  Worse, you may have to ensure that onlypeople with similar security clearances use any given computer.andP;  That kind ofsecurity is far beyond the scope of this discussion.andM;A lot of computer crime, as it turns out, isperpetrated from within theorganizations victimized rather than from outside.andP;  The first action that asite which is worried about security issues should take is to organize abrief seminar for users on the responsible exercise of computer privileges.andO;Users need to understand the role they play in ensuring computersecurity--including logging out when they should, keeping their passwordssecret, and not abusing superuser privileges (resisting the temptation toread items they might find in other users' mailboxes, for example).andO;Vigilance of this sort will be the topic of a later column.andM;Guaranteeing computer security need not be a hopelessly expensiveproposition, however.andP;  There are a few simple precautions that can be takento reduce the risk of penetration.andM;MotivationsandM;Why would anyone want to break into your system?andP;  There are several motives.andO;Some skilled people wish only to cause harm--they practice a sort ofelectronic vandalism.andP;  Others may wish to prove something by breaking into anordinary account.andP;  Still others may wish to prove they can break into asuperuser's account.andP;  A few will simply be trying to avoid charges or quotas.andO;Some might want to be able to brag about having done something bad, or be insearch of secret thrills.andP;  Of course, industrial espionage (or sabotage) isalways a possible motive: in any computer system, there is bound to be somedata that someone will find valuable.andP;  It is safe to say that few, it any,system crackers will end up benefiting your computer system once they haveentered it without your authorization.andM;It only takes a few moments for a perpetrator to set up an account or to doreal damage to your system if he or she has access to a terminal on whichsomeone is logged in as superuser.andP;  It can take longer, but is neverthelesssometimes possible, for a perpetrator to set up a procedure that allows laterentry to the computer if he or she has access to a terminal where someone islogged in as a normal user.andP;  Administrators can address these issues byencouraging users to log out whenever they leave their terminal unattended,especially if it is located in an area that mght be visited by untrustworthyindividuals.andP;  So-called idle-daemons that scan teletype lines to log outusers whose terminals are idle for more than 30 minutes (or any specifiedperiod of time) can help in this quest.andP;  Superusers should, of course, neverabandon their terminal while it is in highly privileged mode.andM;Some vendors supply standard accounts and passwords with a system when it isinstalled.andP;  These accounts should be removed, or at the least have theirpasswords invalidated immediately following installation.andP;  If a vendor needsspecial access to your system, make special passwords for your system andextract an oath of fealty from your vendor.andP;  Requiring your vendor to callyou to set up a password before logging in may be a good practice.andM;Dial-Up and Password SecurityandM;Authenticating users you allow to dial into your site is a real problem.andO;Scanning is a widely known technique for finding modems; you might have seenit used in the film War Games.andP;  A personal computer dials each phone numberin a given exchange sequentially (555-0000, 555-0001, 555-0002, and so on,for instance).andP;  If you work at night in a company where individual employeeshave their own private phone numbers, you might have heard this happen as onephone after another rings up and down the halls.andM;I personally had the opportunity to watch my former employer's security guardanswer 200 calls in a row, only to be hung up on instantly each time.andP;  Thecaller was scanning approximately three or four phones per minute.andP;  Allnight.andP;  Every night.andP;  In a month, that's about 60,000 phones--even if the badguy only has his machine dial out for eight hours a day.andP;  With a somewhatgreater investment--say 14 hours per weekday, 24 hours on weekends--thatfigure quickly increases to more than 100,000 telephones per month; thatcomes to 1.2 million phone numbers a year, far more than there are in all butthe twenty or so most populous cities in the US!andM;Of course, just knowing your modem number won't help--or will it? What if theperpetrator happens to know a few people who work at your company, orcorresponds with some of them by electronic mail? Knowing login names isusually pretty trivial, as it turns out.andP;  And what about passwords?andP;  In mostinstallations, amateur password crackers can guess 20 to 30 percent of thepasswords simply on the basis of employee names, addresses, phone numbers,names of spouses, and similar biographical data.andP;  Of course, it only takes asingle passworod to get an intruder into a system; once the /etc/passwordfile has been extracted, the perpetrator can crack the passwords at his orher leisure.andP;  One professional cracker claimed to be able to decipher about80 percent of the passwords in any given password file--if you let himcalculate all night on his minicomputer.andM;How does one fight this kind of break-in?andP;  Let's examine the cracker's tools.andO;First, he or she can dial into your computer and try name-passwordcombinations.andP;  If you set up your system to disconnect after two or threewrong combinations, you will greatly increase the time an intruder needs tocrack a single password.andP;  You probably won't be able to increase it enough tothwart a determined cracker, though.andM;If you really want to thwart a determined cracker, then have login keep trackof recent consecutive failed login attempts.andP;  When the number exceeds aspecified limit, arrange it so that the program disables the line completelyand notifies the system administrator.andP;  It is easy enough to restore adial-in line the next morning.andP;  This scheme dramatically reduces the numberof attempts an off-site cracker can make.andM;Logging failed dial-in attempts helps immensely.andP;  Your login program shouldstore all invalid name-password combinations in a logfile.andP;  A short programinvoked early every morning by cron should mail a copy of this list (maybesorted by user name) to the system administrator.andP;  While a small number ofentries is reasonable and to be expected, a would-be cracker will have made alarge number of bad (we can hope) tries.andM;One standard logging technique allows each of your users to help you.andP;  Duringthe login sequence, most UNIX systems announce the last time and place userslogged in.andP;  Users should glance at this line and make sure the information itdisplays is reasonable.andP;  If it is not, they should contact theiradministrator immediately, of course.andM;Some administrators routinely log (often using cron) those users active atnight (when most users are away).andP;  Routine checking like this can quicklyuncover unauthorized users of your system.andM;Password SelectionandM;It should be clear that password selection is very important where modems areinvolved.andP;  One site in the South was cracked within two minutes by a crackerwho noticed a unique signon (used for diagnostics).andP;  Choosing the obviouspassword gave the perpetrator access almost instantly.andP;  Ideally, passwordsshould be a string of at least eight letters, numbers, and punctuation marks.andO;The large number of combinations possible when all these are used willdiscourage most crackers.andP;  The worst passwords are the user's login name (ifyou think this is an uncommon practice, try cracking your own system's/etc/paswd file by using account names as password entries to the respectiveaccounts); information taken from the user's GCOS fields in the passwordfile; and biographical information associated with the user (including spousenames, children's names, addresses, alma maters, military affiliations, andthose sorts of things).andM;One handy method for thwarting dial-up password attacks is to require remoteusers to have a second password for the dial-up process.andP;  It is relativelyeasy for you (or your vendor) to modify login to demand the password for auser named dialup if the teletype line being used corresponds to a dial-upline.andP;  The login program can ignore any user name whose UID corresponds tothat of uucp and remain compatible with your UUCP peers.andP;  Of course, youshould log failed dial-up attempts, too.andP;  Dial-up passwords should be changedmonthly to a reasonable, easy-to-remember phrase.andP;  Some companies have asingle employee whose job it is to hand out the passwords, verbally, to otheremployees she or he knows.andM;I have found that pairs of three- to five-letter words make fine passwords.andO;They are easy to remember (thus obviating the necessity to write the passworddown for all to see) and usually fairly easy to type.andP;  They are intrinsicallydifficult to guess--again, too many combinations.andP;  Some modern passwordprograms require eight letters, at least one of which must be a digit orpunctuation character (including a control character or two can drivecrackers batty).andM;Some administrators believe passwords should be changed regularly.andP;  As longas they are not simply alternated (or written down!), this is not such a badidea.andP;  On the other hand, infrequent users are the ones most likely toviolate elementary security rules.andP;  Once they have a good password, it mightbe better to leave well enough alone.andP;  Some administrators go so far as toassign nonsense passwords to new users.andP;  This method also has its advantages.andM;Certain UNIX systems have a file known as /etc/securetty (or somethingsimilar).andP;  Only teletype lines listed in this file (or, maybe, markedappropriately in gettytab to allow login as root) can be logged into by root.andO;Clearly, this can reduce superuser penetrations.andM;Other UNIX systems allow specification of a time interval during which userscan log in.andP;  This can reduce certain kinds of abuse from within anorganization.andP;  Some kinds of users will greatly resent this scheme, so use itwisely in your organization.andM;Trojan Horses at Login TimeandM;Just as the Greeks left a little gift in the horse they brought to Troy, somay some crackers plant surreptitious programs in your system.andP;  While one ofthe best schemes requires that the cracker already be able to log in to thesystem, it is so effective that it bears mentioning here.andM;Consider a program that precisely mimics your login protocol.andP;  Once itbegins, it leaves an innocent little herald on your terminal:andM;Spiffy Enterprises - UNIX 4.2BSD (xyzzy)andM;loggin:andM;This program is, of course, masquerading as getty and login.andP;  Jon Smithapproaches the terminal and tries to log in.andM;Spiffy Enterprises - UNIX 4.2BSD (xyzzy)andM;login: smithandM;Password:andM;The Trojan horse calmly turns off echo, waits for a carriage return, writesthe password to a logfile, and prints: Login incorrect.andP;  Then it either exits(logs out) or overlays itself with login.andP;  smith is none the wiser, thinkinghe might have mistyped the password, and tries again (no doubt successfullythe second time).andP;  The perpetrator soon has a large number of logins andpasswords.andP;  If he or she is lucky, even the superuser logs on.andM;The PLATO system at the University of Illinois reduces this kind of risk byrequiring users to enter the &quot;stop any program no matter what&quot; keystrokeduring the login process.andP;  It is impossible for any PLATO program (except thelogin process) to catch this key.andP;  Such a solution appears to be impracticalat present for UNIX systems, however.andM;Good physical security is a great way to decrease security risks on UNIXsystems, but the existence of dial-in modems (and all sorts of networks)reduces its effectiveness.andP;  Passwords are, therefore, the first line ofdefense on most UNIX systems.andP;  They should be chosen with care, and dial-upsshould be closely monitored.andP;  Future columns will address other aspects ofsystem security.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
