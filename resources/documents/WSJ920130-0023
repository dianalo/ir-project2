Eager to promote a squeaky-clean image for the phoneservices, the National Association for Information Servicesand InfoText Publishing Inc. last night gave Golden Phoneawards to the creme de la creme of the touch-tone circuit.Entrants offering phone help ranging from the &quot;ButterballTurkey Talk Line&quot; to &quot;The Agatha Christie Mystery VacationSweepstakes&quot; gathered in Las Vegas, Nev., to celebrate thewinners, which included this newspaper's JournalPhone.</LP><TEXT>   Other winners included Tele-Lawyer, Blue White Hotline(Penn State University's sports line), 1-800-DENTIST (one ofthe few free-service entrants) and PepsiCola's License toChill promotion. (Sponsors of the awards exclude programmingthat describes sexual conduct.) About 14,000 &quot;900&quot; lines areoperating.   Organizer John Irvine says there are thoughts ofbroadening the contest to include overseas 900 ventures,although he says the language gap makes judging a bitdifficult. Nonetheless, one foreign entrant made it to thefinals this year: Drakodaren, a Swedish interactive gameprogram. In English, the game is Dragonslayer.   Judges rank the phone line services, most of thempay-per-call, on content, value and a mix of program,production quality, ease of use and creativity.   Choices aren't easy. What provides greater service for themoney? The &quot;Hulk Hogan WWF Wrestling Challenge&quot; or the&quot;Cheers Trivia Game,&quot; based on the TV comedy show? How aboutthe &quot;Preview Line,&quot; which gives the U.S. Roman CatholicChurch's opinion on 1,000 movies and videos, or the &quot;DwarfHelpline,&quot; a referral line for short-statured persons?   One of the finalists, &quot;Indy 500 Pit Talk,&quot; promises toeavesdrop on the private conversations of the drivers andtheir pit crews for $1.50 a minute. The line delivers, butmuch of the chat is fuzzy, and a commentator helps translateit to guide a neophyte through an arcane discussion of carparts.   One entrant, a service to locate jobs, may be moredepressing than helpful. &quot;Good hunting]&quot; begins the messagecheerfully, but a test call listed only one job opening -- inthe computers and science field in northern California.</TEXT></DOC>
