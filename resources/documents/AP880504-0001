The plane carring journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann and diplomatsMarcel Fontaine and Marcel Carton stopped briefly in Salonica,Greece, and in Corsica on its way to Paris. In Corsica, it was metby Interior Minister Charles Pasqua and a medical team.   ``It's the most beautiful day of my life. There are no otherwords,'' Kauffmann told RTL radio, whose reporter Roger Auque _himself a former hostage _ was permitted to board the plane inSalonica.   ``It's a rebirth, because for three years I won't say we lived,we survived,'' he said.   ``It's the end of a nightmare, a nightmare that lasted threeyears and then some,'' Carton told RTL.   ``At first we were together, then we were separated,'' he said.``We saw other hostages, but we did not know exactly who theywere.''   Wednesday's release leaves 18 foreigners, including nineAmericans, missing and believed held captive in Lebanon by Moslemextremists.   Renee Veyret, the second secretary at the French Embassy inBeirut, told The Associated Press that Carton, 62, Fontaine, 45,and Kauffmann, 44, were set free at 7:20 p.m. (1:20 p.m. EDT)Wednesday near the Summerland Hotel in the seaside Jnahneighborhood of the Lebanese capital.   There were reports in Beirut this week that France had agreed topay Iran $670 million still owed to Iran on a billion-dollar loanmade by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The French governmentfroze payments after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.   The kidnappers in Lebanon were believed to have loyalties toIran.   Kauffmann and Fontaine both spoke of being blindfolded andchained.   ``No longer to have a blindfold ... chains,'' Kauffmann said.``I wouldn't say we were in a tomb but, after all, it is a littlelike that.''   Kauffmann said the hostages had heard little news. He did notknow who was running in Sunday's second round of Frenchpresidential elections.   ``I knew my wife fought for me, not only for me, but for us,''he said.   Joelle Kauffmann made several trips to Beirut and made frequentpublic appeals for the hostages' release.   Fontaine said, ``To have had a blindfold over your eyes, andchains on your hands and feet, that makes a change. It is thedifference between night and day.''   In Strasbourg, France, conservative Premier Jacques Chirac, whofaces incumbent Socialist Francois Mitterrand the presidentialelection this Sunday, announced the men's release Wednesday at acampaign rally.   ``I have been informed just now that the three French hostagesin Lebanon were freed and have been turned over to a representativeof the interior minister,'' he said.   ``I am thinking of the horrible time they've been through, whichthey didn't deserve. ... I am thinking of the one who, alas, wasthe victim of these kidnappers and has not returned,'' Chirac said.   He was referring to Michel Seurat, 39, who was kidnapped May 22,1985. Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group, claimed itkilled him March 5, 1986. His body was not found, but his wife saysFrench officials confirmed his death.   A total of 10 French hostages now have been released sinceChirac took office in 1986.   Mitterrand, appearing later on national TV, expressed happinessabout the release but sorrow for ``the one who did not return,Michel Seurat, and for his family, as well as for the foreignhostages still held in Lebanon.''   In Washington, the State Department said it was awaiting detailsof the release.   ``We would be concerned by any sign that concessions weremade,'' the State Department said. ``We believe concessionsencourage future kidnappings and could prolong the captivity ofother hostages.''   The release followed weeks of reports that Chirac's governmentwas working feverishly, through contacts with the Iraniangovernment and elsewhere, to win the men's freedom.   Hostage negotiations, shrouded in official secrecy, were thesubject of continuing press speculation. Last December, Franceexpelled 17 Iranian exile opponents of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,but denied this had any connection with hostage talks.   French negotiator Jean-Charles Marchiani, personalrepresentative of French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, met thefreed captives at the headquarters of the Syrian army in Beirut,embassy secretary Veyret said.   Marchiani, a former intelligence officer, made several trips toBeirut in recent weeks.   He had negotiated the freedom of two other French captives,Auque and Jean-Louis Normandin, last November.   In Damascus, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said in astatement: ``As in the past, Syria exerted efforts to ensure therelease of hostages.''   Pasqua said the former hostages would be taken to a militaryhospital in Paris.   In Beirut, the Moslem-controlled Voice of the Nation quoted areporter at the Summerland hotel as saying the three Frenchmen werebrought there in a black Mercedes that had no license plates.   Carton, the embassy vice consul in Beirut, and Fontaine, anembassy protocol officer, had been missing since March 22, 1985.Islamic Jihad said its members kidnapped them.   Kauffmann, a journalist working for the weekly magazineL'Envenement du Jeudi, and Seurat, an academic researcher, werekidnapped May 22, 1985.   The longest-held foreign hostage in Lebanon is Terry A.Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   The November release of Auque and Normandin reportedly involvedFrance agreeing to let Wahid Gordji, an employee at the IranianEmbassy, leave France. Gordji was wanted for questioning inconnection with terrorist bombings.</TEXT></DOC>
