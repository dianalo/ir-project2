These days he talks about the need for China to develop its own economic style -- one in which eventually wages would be determined by the market and enterprises would be &quot;responsible both for profits and losses.&quot;    To hear such ideas discussed openly is rare in the icy political climate that has gripped China in the week since a dramatic shakeup in the leadership of the Communist Party. The current campaign against &quot;bourgeois liberalization&quot; -- or by a more accurate translation, &quot;capitalistic liberalization&quot; -- has made the Chinese more reluctant than ever to meet with foreigners.    Mindful of the recent demotion and humiliation of intellectuals such as astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, we asked Prof. Li if he was sure he wanted to speak on the record. Yes, he said, stipulating that he believed the Communist Party was moving in the right direction, which he described as socialism. &quot;I support the party's leadership,&quot; he said. &quot;There's no problem in using my name.&quot; The conversation left us with the hope that Prof. Li had some reason to believe his country's rulers know how much is riding on their next move.    The issue is not whether the party leadership can find a way to conform economic liberalization to communist ideology, with its recurring purges and its secret deliberations over who is adhering to the &quot;four cardinal principles&quot; of the moment. The real question is how long the Chinese Communist Party of slightly more than 40 million members is prepared to hold its institutional power as more important than realizing the immense potential of the other billion or so people in China.    In theory, this goverment, or any government, hopes its term in power will coincide with some significant improvement in the conditions of daily life. To this end, the Communist Party for more than 37 years has told the people of China how to conduct their lives -- what to produce, where to work and how to behave. And with its theories decreed as policy, the party has dragged the country on a long, wretched march to nowhere.    The rigid market controls destroyed incentives and the ability of China's once-thriving markets to transmit information freely via prices. Tens of millions have died of famine and disease, and hundreds of millions have spent decades close to starvation. Virtually everyone has suffered from the political repression needed to achieve this waste. Any hopes for Chinese communism not lost in the Great Leap Forward of the 1950s were dashed by the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s.    The open-door policy and the economic reforms that began under Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s have offered the country's citizens a glimpse of real opportunity -- a chance to work hard, get something in return and begin to build China. Greater freedom for agriculture brought a boom in the countryside. Relaxation of some economic controls in the cities has encouraged street markets and improved living standards. Intellectuals have begun to see that freedom and development are two sides of the same coin. Visitors to China from the U.S. securities industry marveled at how thoroughly Chinese students have grasped the principles and techniques of the financial markets necessary to support a vibrant economy.    Against this backdrop, the students who demonstrated for democracy in December are asking for more responsibility for their country's future, not less. So are the Chinese students currently studying in America who sent the Communist Party Central Committee the open letter that is reprinted nearby.    We don't minimize the difficulties Deng Xiaoping faces. It may be that the cruelest legacy of communism is that its huge edifice of institutionalized power is the ultimate prison. The party, no matter how pointless or counterproductive it has become, remains paramount, astride its people. That is the dilemma of Deng Xiaoping. The clear truth remains that the ideas being explored by people such as Prof. Li and many of the students are the hope of China. The test is whether Deng Xiaoping and the Communist Party leaders can find the wisdom to work with these ideas rather than against them. </TEXT></DOC>
