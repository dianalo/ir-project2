The move is one of corporate America's most sweepingconcessions to the growing public sentiment that electronicdatabases of sensitive information are used in ways thatthreaten personal privacy. Equifax officials yesterday madesurprisingly strong statements that they now consider theirmailing-list activity morally wrong.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Continuing the business just wouldn't be consistent witha socially responsible position,&quot; said Equifax senior vicepresident John Baker. &quot;It's difficult to see that the properprivacy balance is being struck with this service.&quot;   Equifax is currently one of the biggest players in theexploding mailing-list business, thanks to its special roleas a storehouse of financial data on virtually everyAmerican. Banks and stores regularly send this data toEquifax and its two major rivals, TRW Inc. and Trans UnionCorp., which, in turn, send them reports on candidates forloans or credit cards.   But using this data for mailing lists, which thecredit-reporting industry began doing over the past fiveyears, falls into a gray area of federal law, which limitsthe data's use to &quot;permissible&quot; business purposes.   In the past year, the credit-reporting industry has faceda wave of criticism about inaccuracies, shoddy consumerrelations and invasions of privacy, including a chorus ofcharges that mailing lists aren't a permissible purpose forcredit data.   In June, Congress held hearings on five proposed laws tooverhaul the credit-reporting industry. The proposals includeseveral provisions to outlaw mailing lists drawn from creditdata. Last month, attorneys general in six states charged TRWwith several illegal acts in its credit-reporting business,including the sale of mailing lists.   Representatives of the New York attorney general's officemet with Equifax officials in July to discuss itsmailing-list business and other credit-reporting practices,but hasn't taken any legal action. Equifax continued tomaintain yesterday that its mailing-list business neverviolated the law.   But, like other credit reporting companies, Equifax's vastknowledge of Americans' personal finances made it a majorplayer in the exploding market for customized mailing lists.Equifax offered mailers a &quot;credit seekers hotline,&quot; featuringtwo million names of people who asked for a loan or creditcard over the past month, charging a nickel a name. &quot;Makingthis inquiry is a strong indicator that these prospects wantto make new purchases,&quot; Equifax marketing literatureproclaimed.   Another Equifax list promised 11.5 million names of&quot;consumers with credit accounts that have shown activitywithin the last 30 days.&quot;   For an extra charge, Equifax would provide these namesbroken down by age, gender, marital status, &quot;dwelling unittype,&quot; and &quot;shopping psychographics,&quot; indicating whether aconsumer was a &quot;prestige shopper,&quot; a &quot;lower middle Americashopper,&quot; or fell into other categories.   Cleveland-based TRW and the other major credit-reportingcompany, closely held Trans Union of Chicago, have similarlists for sale. Both companies said they haven't any plans tofold up their own mailing-list businesses. Equifax, based inAtlanta, backed off from another contentious venture earlierthis year. Along with Lotus Development Corp., it had planneda personal computer product called Marketplace, containingpersonal data about the shopping habits of about 120 millionU.S. households.   Equifax and Lotus canceled Marketplace in January,following a firestorm of protest from more than 30,000consumers. The product would have contained data alreadywidely available to marketers, but protesters were appalledthat anyone with a personal computer would suddenly haveaccess to the information.   Yesterday, privacy advocates and other critics of thecredit-reporting industry praised Equifax for its lateststep.   &quot;Equifax is accepting the central privacy principle of theinformation age, that information disclosed for one purposeshould not be used for another purpose without the person'sconsent,&quot; said Marc Rotenberg, Washington director ofComputer Professionals for Social Responsibility. &quot;Equifaxhas called into question direct-marketing practices that toomany companies have taken for granted.&quot;   The move won't have a significant financial impact forEquifax, which had net income of $63.9 million on revenue of$1.08 billion in 1990. Equifax said its mailing-list businesshad sales of about $11 million and 60 employees, about halfof whom will probably be laid off.   Equifax said it will continue another junk-mail businessthat has also come under fire, sending credit-card offers toconsumers who meet a bank's criteria for demographics andcreditworthiness. The Federal Trade Commission and even somejunk-mail critics have approved of this practice. Theirreasoning is that even unsolicited offers of credit arepermissible uses of credit data under the law.   Equifax's recent efforts to mollify its critics mark astriking shift for a company that has been the object ofhigh-profile accusations of gross privacy abuses.   Equifax's large business of investigating applicants forlife insurance made it the target of harsh congressionaltestimony in the 1970s. Critics charged that Equifax, thenRetail Credit Co., made its investigators meet quotas forturning up derogatory information about applicants. They alsoclaimed the company's investigators were so overworked theyhad to make up many of their reports. The company deniedthese charges, but they were instrumental in creating newregulations on consumer reporting.   Under new management and a new name, Equifax has been themost image-conscious company by far in its industry. Twoyears ago it hired Columbia University privacy scholar AlanWestin to do regular audits of its information practices.Last month it also announced plans for a $9 million center toanswer consumers' questions about credit reports, and said itwould make the reports easier to understand.</TEXT></DOC>
