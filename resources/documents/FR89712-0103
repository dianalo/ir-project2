On November 21, 1988, the Bureau of Export Administrationpublished a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> to implement this provision. Having receivedand considered comments, the Bureau of Export Administration is issuinga final rule expanding the permissive reexport provisions of andSection;774.2 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR 774.2) toallow reexports of U.S. commodities to and among COCOM participating countries,Finland, and Switzerland, without prior U.S. authorization. Certain limitedexceptions are specified. The reexporter must submit a written notification report to the Officeof Export Licensing if the U.S. origin commodities listed in SupplementNo. 1 or 4 to Part 773 are being reexported from a country other than aCOCOM participating country, Finland or Switzerland. The rule specifieswhat information must be included in the notification. The permissive reexport provision would require that a Swiss Blue ImportCertificate be obtained by the reexporting party before reexporting intoSwitzerland. This procedure will not in any way alter the licensing requirements foritems to the Soviet Union and other COCOM-proscribed countries. This rule exempts reexports of supercomputers. The Department will treatcases involving supercomputers on a case-by-case basis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective July 7, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Patricia Muldonian, RegulationsBranch, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration,Telephone: (202) 377-2440. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA), signed by the Presidenton August 23, 1988, amends section 5(a)(4) of the Export AdministrationAct of 1979 (EAA), requiring the removal of controls over most reexportsto COCOM and 5(k) countries. Consistent with the OTCA, the Department ofCommerce issued a proposed rule on November 21, 1988 (53 FR 46878) witha request for comments on ways to implement the legislative requirements.The proposed rule would have expanded the permissive reexport provisionsof andSection; 774.2 to allow reexports of U.S. commodities to and amongCOCOM participating countries, and Switzerland without prior U.S. authorization,provided that the Office of Export Licensing is notified in writing whenthe U.S. commodities being reexported are above the PRC Green Zone level.In addition, this proposal would not have authorized the use of the permissivereexport provision for reexports to entities that the reexporter knowsor has reason to know are controlled-in-fact by Country Groups Q, W, Y,or Z. The Department received comments from 18 firms and associations. In general,public comments acknowledged that the proposed rule was a positive steptoward reducing unnecessary licensing burdens in order to increase competitivenessof U.S. exports abroad. However, most commenters expressed reservationsthat the proposal severely limited the usefulness of the provision forU.S. controlled commodities moved to and among COCOM participating countries.Some commenters objected to one provision of the proposed rule under whicha party that reexports U.S. commodities not identified in any of the AdvisoryNotes in the Commodity Control List must submit a reexport notificationin writing to the Department, no later than the next business day followingshipment and by a means intended to effect delivery within five days oftransmission. With two exceptions, the final rule removes the notificationrequirement if reexports are between COCOM participating countries, Finland,and Switzerland. Although this final rule retains the notification requirementfor reexports into COCOM, Finland and Switzerland from other countries,it is modified to a more sensitive level of technology. Specifically, thisfinal rule requires notification only if the commodities are identifiedin Supplement No. 1 or 4 to Part 773. In addition, the notification reportsneed not be sent until the second business day following shipment. Thenotification reports are to be sent by airmail or another means that willprovide equally expeditious delivery.Some commenters observed that the Act addresses ``goods and technology''while the proposal dealt only with goods. BXA is revising the technicaldata regulations and will address reexports of technology in that separatedocument.The proposed rule would not have made this permissive reexport provisionavailable when the reexporter knows or has reason to know that the shipmentis intended for persons or entities that are controlled-in-fact by governmentsof Country Groups Q, W, Y, or Z. Many commenters expressed concern thatother COCOM countries do not have the same restriction and that these unilateralcontrols placed an unfair restriction on U.S. competitiveness. This finalrule removes the restriction in its entirety.In addition, the proposed rule specified Switzerland as the only non-COCOMcountry eligible to benefit from the permissive reexport provision. Manycommenters questioned why only Switzerland was included; they believedthat Congress intended to include other countries for eligibility. TheEAA provides for the exercise of judgment as to whether a country's exportcontrols are comparable in practice to those of COCOM participating countries.The Department of Commerce can also treat a country like a COCOM participatingcountry in some or all respects under the EAR without having determinedthat the country's export controls are fully comparable in practice tothe COCOM system. Because of the continued improvement in its export controls,this final rule adds Finland on this discretionary basis as a country towhich this permissive reexport provision will apply. Possible extensionto other countries will be considered.The Department will monitor the effectiveness of the notification requirementto determine the extent to which such requirement should be continued ormodified. The Department estimated that if the general license had beenin effect in FY 1988, approximately 11,214 reexport authorization requestsrepresenting approximately 11.28 billion dollars would not have been necessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. This rule is consistent with Executive Orders 12291 and 12661.2. This rule includes a collection of information requirement under thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection of information has been approved bythe Office of Management and Budget under control number 0694-0052. Theproposed rule, published on November 21, 1988 (53 FR 46878) estimated thepublic reporting burden for the reexport notification collection to averageapproximately 16 minutes per response including the time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.The public was encouraged to comment to the Office of Management and Budgeton the reporting burden at that time. The Office of Management and Budgetand BXA will continue to accept comments regarding the burden estimateor any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestionsfor reducing this burden. Comments should be directed to: Office of Managementand Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC20503, Attn: Paperwork Reduction Act Project 0694-0052, Office of Securityand Management Support, Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. Departmentof Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.4. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. Nevertheless, to helpascertain the economic impact of the regulation upon the general public,the regulation was issued in proposed form and public comment was solicited.Because this rule was originally issued in proposed form, it complies withsection 13(b) of the Export Administration Act. 5. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 774 </ITAG>Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR Parts 730-799)are amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 774_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
