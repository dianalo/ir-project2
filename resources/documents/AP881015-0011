Lt. Col. Francisco Baula, accused in a 1987 attempted coup thatleft 53 people dead and more than 300 wounded, died at a militaryhospital about nine hours after his bid to escape from the suburbanCamp Crame stockade, military officials said.   Last year's military uprising, led by former Lt. Col. Gregorio``Gringo'' Honasan, was the most serious effort to oust thegovernment of President Corazon Aquino. She came to power inFebruary 1986 after a military-civilian uprising ousted PresidentFerdinand Marcos, who fled to Hawaii.   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the PhilippineConstabulary, said Baula was shot and wounded three times after herefused to halt and ignored warning shots. The stockade is locatedat the constabulary.   Montano said Baula slipped into a dark corner of the stockadeshortly after midnight and tried to climb over the wall with amakeshift ladder.   Percival Adiong, the Camp Crame commandant, said Baula usedwooden slats and the two frames of his double-decker bed to makethe ladder.   ``Our investigation shows that there were no others who tried tohelp him,'' Montano said.   Baula was arrested Oct. 3 with two other military men sought inconnection with the coup attempt on Aug. 28, 1987.   Honasan remains at large.
