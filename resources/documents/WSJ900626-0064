Mr. Bush had wanted the ANC leaderto go further and renounce all violence.   Mr. Mandela said the ANC decided in 1986 to scale down itsarmed &quot;struggle&quot; and pursue negotiations. He said the call tostop hostilities could come &quot;as soon as the (South African)government removes all obstacles to negotiations.&quot; Theconditions he listed are: the return of 20,000 politicalexiles, the release of 1,000 political prisoners, the repealof oppressive legislation, the ending of political trials andthe full lifting of the state of emergency.   The anti-apartheid leader, who is on an eight-city tour ofthe U.S., also met yesterday with Secretary of State JamesBaker. Today, he is scheduled to address a joint session ofCongress, where he may draw criticism for his indications ofsupport for Cuban leader Fidel Castro, Palestine LiberationOrganization chief Yasser Arafat and Libyan leader MoammarGadhafi, whom he called &quot;brother leader.&quot;   In a news briefing, Mr. Cohen said Mr. Mandela didn't askPresident Bush yesterday to intensify U.S. sanctions againstthe South African government. During a brief airport sessionwith reporters after his plane landed in Washington onSunday, Mr. Mandela had indicated he would make such arequest.   U.S. sanctions will remain in place until conditions thatare specified in U.S. law -- a full lifting of the SouthAfrican state of emergency and the release of politicalprisoners -- are met, according to Mr. Cohen.   At a news conference about two hours after his meeting andluncheon with the president, Mr. Mandela said the ANC woulduse the unspecified amount of funds he requested from Mr.Bush for &quot;the task of mobilizing the entire country aroundthe peace process which we, the African National Congress,have launched.&quot; Despite Mr. Cohen's comments, he said &quot;Ourimpression is the president was sympathetic to our appeal forresources.&quot;   Mr. Cohen later indicated that the U.S. this fiscal yearis spending a total of $42 million to aid the people of SouthAfrica, $32 million for scholarships and $10 million for avariety of projects. But he added: &quot;There will be no money .. . directly to the ANC from the United States government.&quot;   Both Mr. Mandela and Mr. Cohen said the two sides narrowedtheir differences and reached better understandings on issuesconcerning South Africa and the U.S. The president and Mr.Mandela did &quot;agree to disagree,&quot; Mr. Cohen said, on issuesthat are peripheral to the task of ending apartheid anddeveloping South African democracy.   One such issue is the Bush administration's militaryassistance for rebel groups fighting the government ofAngola. Shortly after arriving in Washington, Mr. Mandelasaid ANC officials &quot;strongly condemn&quot; that aid.</TEXT></DOC>
