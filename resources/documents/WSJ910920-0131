And, until some changes are made, it ends here,too.   &quot;Here it is, the power center,&quot; he announces dryly,swinging open the door. &quot;I suppose the SEC looks a littledifferent.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   It does. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has astaff of 2,375, including 312 investigators. Mr. Dreyling,the government overseer of the chief exchange for Europe'slargest economy, works out of a spare room rented from alocal wine maker by Hesse state's economics ministry, locatedacross town.   Mr. Dreyling hasn't any other professional staff -- notrading screen, no databanks, not even a market news service.In the absence of German laws against insider trading, noneof it was needed. Mr. Dreyling's job was to read newspapersand pass occasional judgment on procedural questions, such asfutures settlements. Enforcing the two securities laws in thebooks -- both of which forbid trading swindles andmanipulation -- was never a priority.   &quot;Our legal arsenal against these kinds of activitiesamounts to nothing,&quot; concedes the gray-bearded official. &quot;Itcould get lonely here. But times are changing.&quot;   Certainly, perceptions are. A widening scandal involvingallegations of systemic insider violations and trading fraudhas dealt the most serious blow to the exchange's image inits recent history. And many now are questioning the gripthat powerful German banks have on the market, and theirlong-accepted assurances that a code of honor deterredabuses.   Germany's controls, such as they are, are scant even forEurope. Until recently, Italy was the only other majorEuropean market that had no laws against insider trading. NowGermany, alone, bears that distinction.   With new regulations apparently unavoidable, the powerfulbanking lobby is conceding that current controls might not bewhat they could be. Now, the banks are modifying theirarguments to prevent their worst fear: creation of afull-powered watchdog agency patterned after the SEC.   The European Community has long pressed Germany to clampdown in time for the planned integration of EC financialmarkets after 1992. But compliance has accelerated latelymainly because of one thing: Somebody squawked.   In June, first one, then at least three other anonymousletters were published alleging widespread trading violationsby floor traders, securities brokers and even senior bankofficials. Specific activities and names were mentioned,including those of senior options traders at Deutsche BankAG, although they have since been exonerated by the InsiderCommission. The panel enforces the voluntary trading rules ofthe self-regulated Frankfurt stock exchange.   Then, last Monday, the director of the German-markEurobond department of Dresdner Bank resigned along with fourother bank employees after an audit disclosed violations ofthe bank's internal controls. The disclosure by Germany'ssecond-largest bank added fresh momentum to allegations ofwidespread abuses within Germany's securities industry.   The Frankfurt prosecutor's office said this week that thenumber of securities traders targeted by an investigationinto tax fraud has tripled to 150 suspects in a few weeks. Asyet, no one has been formally charged, and state attorneysconcede that proving any resulting cases will be difficultbecause the few laws that exist are vague.   Germany's investigation isn't likely to bring the samespectacular shakeouts stemming from this summer'sinvestigation of insider trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,or the U.S. probe into price-fixing and collusion in the U.S.government-securities market.   But a crisis of market confidence here couldn't be moreill-timed. German unification and the opening of EasternEurope promised to help Frankfurt challenge London asEurope's pre-eminent financial center. Companies are floatingequity to finance Eastern expansion, and there areindications that here is where Eastern demand could meetWestern supply.   But for this to work, the German market needs a risingflow of foreign capital and fresh input from the hoard ofinherited wealth now being passed down by Germany's postwargeneration. Perhaps more than anything else, it is theprospect of losing business -- and opportunities -- that ischanging the way in which Germany's clubby network of banksand industry view market controls.   &quot;Frankfurt has been an open playground for years,&quot;confides an experienced German broker who works at a foreignbank in Frankfurt. &quot;But people are realizing that it's timeto grow up, or miss a big chance.&quot;   At the very least, the German investigation has stirredthe suspicions of domestic and international investors thatsomething was wrong with the way Germany regulated itssecurities industry.   In interviews, German brokers, securities lawyers andlaw-enforcement officials privately confirm dubious dealings.Common practices included &quot;front-running&quot; on customer orders,delaying time-stamps on trades, getting a jump on earningsreports from their own bank, or performing advance trades ona takeover deal or influential reports. Latitude for abusesalso stems from permissive bank rules over what a broker maytrade on his own account.   &quot;If you know of a huge block of customer orders in thepipeline for that morning, it's easy to get your own order infirst,&quot; says one broker, explaining a common example offront-running.   The exchange's rules are loose regarding the time-stampingof order tickets. At the end of the day, a trader can selectwhich tickets he keeps for himself and which are given to hiscustomers or his bank-depending on what prices are on thetickets.   Friedrich von Metzler, a private banker and president ofthe Frankfurt Stock Exchange, concedes that &quot;the events ofthe past weeks have served to reduce the trust of domesticand international investors in the German capital market.&quot;But he cautions that &quot;too strict a control system can lead toan over-regulated market, which can't be in the interests ofinvestors and issuers and can shift trade to other markets.&quot;   As this summer's scandal got rolling, Hilmar Kopper,chairman of Deutsche Bank and doyen of Germany's powerfulbanking community, acknowledged that there are &quot;black sheep&quot;in any industry. He promised new internal reforms andendorsed new legislation. Unlike his predecessors, who madethe bank the staunchest defender of the honor system, Mr.Kopper was one of the few German bankers to suggestinsider-trading legislation as early as last year.   For anybody watching, there have been other warnings. InApril, for example, the SEC blocked investment productslinked to the DAX German Stock Index from being introduced tothe New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Options Exchange,among others, because of inadequate market regulatorycontrols at the source.   Only three years ago, the banks successfully turned back apush for tougher legislation, arguing that moral persuasionthrough a code of honor was more effective than lawenforcement in banishing shady dealings. The politiciansbacked off.   No question, proof of anything untoward has always beenelusive. Since the 1970s, the five-member insider panel hasexonerated all suspects that came before it. The soleexception was in 1985, when a senior banker who also acted assupervisory board chairman of AEG AG was found to have boughtAEG shares during its negotiations to be taken over byDaimler-Benz AG. His only punishment was to repay the 16,000marks ($9,200) he earned from his purchases.   Working on German reforms in time for 1993 are the BonnFinance Ministry, which enacts securities laws, and the Hessestate government, which enforces them in Frankfurt. But itisn't yet clear exactly what kind of laws will prohibitexactly what kind of insider activities.</TEXT></DOC>
