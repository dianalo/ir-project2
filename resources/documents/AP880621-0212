The Alliance to Save Energy, and its chairman Sen. Tim Wirth,D-Colo., reported that fuel bills, after mortgage and rentpayments, are the largest housing expense for the typical Americanfamily, averaging $1,100 annually.   The alliance released a report which shows that a 25 percent cutin energy costs, saving $25 billion annually, could make housingmore affordable for 2 million households, half of whom arelow-income families.   ``While typical middle-income households spend about one-fifthof housing costs on energy, many low-income families spend morethan one-third,'' the alliance said in the report. ``Major changesin energy expenses can thus increase or decrease housingaffordability significantly.''   Wirth told a Capitol Hill news conference: ``It is our firmbelief that an enlightened energy policy can help ease the housingproblem we have today. If we are able to follow the recommendationslaid out by the Alliance report to make housing more affordablethrough energy efficiency ... if we are able to link together theimperatives of energy conservation and energy efficiency, we canhelp to ease this very real housing crisis today.''   Among its conclusions, the panel recommended federal initiativesto:   _Restore the federal responsibility for setting energy standardsfor public and subsidized housing.   _Require states to establish home energy rating systems withinbasic federal guidelines.   _Add energy efficiency investment incentives to housing financeprograms.   _Incorporate energy efficiency provisions in rental assistanceprograms.   _Create tax incentives for housing energy efficiency tostimulate more efficient construction and renovation practices,especially in low income housing.   _Require individual metering in federally assisted rentalhousing, while requiring such buildings to meet high energystandards.   Founded in 1977, the alliance is a non-profit coalition ofbusiness, government and consumer leaders dedicated to increasingthe efficiency of energy use. The alliance conducts research, pilotprojects, education programs and policy advocacy.</TEXT></DOC>
