A comparison of the morphologicaldimensions resulting from various assumptions about the volume distributionof pulmonary airways is also presented. Although deposition is not examinedhere, the varibility in reported measurements underscores the influencethat anatomical parameters can have on deposition calculations and theimportance of further investigation of lung dimensions to reduce theuncertainties in computer simulations of delivered dose, thereby improvingthe data base necessary for risk assessment.</TEXT></DOC>
