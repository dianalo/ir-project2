The Federal Trade Commission said in late January that it opposed the sale because it would substantially reduce competition in the industry. A spokesman for UST said the companies mutually agreed to terminate the accord.    American Maize-Products, Stamford, Conn., has interests in corn wet milling, tobacco and building materials. Through its Helme Tobacco Co. unit, it has a 33% share of the market for snuff, a powdered-tobacco product, the FTC said. The agency added that U.S. Tobacco has 18% of the market and that the two companies are the second-largest and third-largest makers of the product. </TEXT></DOC>
