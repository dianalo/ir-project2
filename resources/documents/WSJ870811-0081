SterbaStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FREST </IN><DATELINE> WELLINGTON, New Zealand  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Before David Lange came along, New Zealand was a notably quiet Western ally of unquestioned loyalty.    New Zealanders were known for raising sheep, producing excellent yachtsmen but bland cheese, losing at cricket and striving unsuccessfully to out-hoity-toity their former colonial masters, the British.    But New Zealanders are always craving more attention, and Mr. Lange (pronounced LONG-e) started getting it for them soon after becoming prime minister in July 1984. Mr. Lange, who is seeking a further mandate in the national election Saturday, quickly put New Zealand on the map. He tweaked the Pentagon's nose by banning U.S. warships from port calls unless they were certifiably devoid of nuclear weapons. And his government convicted and jailed two French government spies who helped blow up a Greenpeace anti-nuclear protest ship. &quot;Every tiny country likes to spit in the eye of a big power, and Mr. Lange has managed to spit in the eye of two of them,&quot; says Coral Bell, an Australian National University professor.    David Russell Lange is, to say the least, different. At age 45, he is one of the West's first Vietnam-generation national leaders, and surely the only one who's had a stomach operation to lose weight.    He has a huge sense of humor and is, by all accounts, a nice man. Critics say he is captivated by his own eloquence. True, he says: &quot;Sometimes I don't know when to shut up.&quot;    His office is next to Parliament in a circular building called the Beehive. From his desk, he snatches a greeting card from Margaret Thatcher and scratches her signature with his thumbnail. &quot;See, it's real,&quot; he says. Some world leaders take care to understand the sensitivities in small countries, he says. Others -- he looks an American visitor in the eye -- don't.    If Mr. Lange has provoked a national debate about New Zealand's place in the world, he has also stood its comfortable citizenry on its economic head by sanctioning his finance minister, Roger Douglas, to dismantle one of the West's most protected and stagnant socialist economies. Mr. Douglas has been stripping away layer upon layer of protectionist laws, subsidies, and government regulations, an exercise here called &quot;Rogernomics.&quot; It's been painful but generally popular.    As Mr. Lange's first term in office nears its end, he is confident of being re-elected for another three years -- and the latest opinion polls show his Labor Party leading the National Party by about 10 percentage points. If Labor does beat the more conservative opposition, it would be a rare accomplishment for a party that hasn't won consecutive terms since World War II -- and a disappointment for the Reagan administration.    &quot;They can't put their money on the opposition's horse because it's trotting off toward the glue factory,&quot; the prime minister says. He has greeted American threats to stop defending New Zealand under the Anzus security treaty linking his country, the U.S. and Australia by saying: terrific, we don't want your nuclear defense.    His biographer, Vernon Wright, says David Lange grew up as a rotund loner. By age 15, all his clothes had to be specially made for him. By the time he finished college, he weighed more than 300 pounds. At school, he was sensitive about his weight. But later, in politics, it became an asset. It made him stand out.    Although he didn't lead demonstrations against the Vietnam War, he was an anti-war worker and speaker in the mid-1960s. After graduating from law school in 1967, he headed for London, where he couldn't find work and was so short of money that he scrounged newspapers from trash cans. Even after getting a $40-a-week job at an insurance company, he would line up with vagrants for meals.    At the Kingsway West London Mission, where he listened to socialist sermons by Methodist theologian Donald Soper and was served supper by a young Nottinghamshire volunteer named Naomi Crampton, he embraced the views of the former and married the latter. The marriage took place the day before Mr. Lange turned 26, allowing both him and his bride to qualify for youth air fares to New Zealand.    There, Mr. Lange briefly practiced as a country lawyer, then returned to law school. Eventually, he became a regular, then the dominant legal personality in Auckland's biggest criminal court.    After he won election to Parliament, his maiden legislative speech in May 1977 propelled him into political prominence. He stopped chain-smoking cigarettes and chain-chugging Cokes, but he couldn't get his weight down.    Then, after losing a 1981 bid to lead the Labor Party, Mr. Lange underwent a somewhat dangerous surgical procedure to reduce the size of his stomach in February 1982. As his weight fell, Mr. Lange gradually adjusted to a new look. He changed his hair style and glasses and started wearing different clothes. His political punch remained, however, and in February 1983, he took over the leadership of a Labor Party committed to banning &quot;nuclear-powered and nuclear weapon-carrying craft&quot; from New Zealand ports.    In his first effort at compromise, he lost. Labor hard-liners rejected his proposal to allow nuclear-powered (but not nuclear-armed) ships to visit, forcing him to carry out a policy he didn't fully support.    &quot;Sometimes I think they will not be satisfied until I sit on top of a nuclear device and detonate it shouting freedom or something,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
