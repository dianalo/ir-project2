Mouawad, a 22-year veteran of Lebanese politics and a MaroniteCatholic, was elected president at a special Parliament sessionthat convened in Syrian-policed north Lebanon.   The session got under way Sunday afternoon with 57 legislatorsattending, eight more than the needed quorum of 49.   The legislators re-elected house speaker Hussein Husseini, aShiite Moslem who has held the post since 1984, for a one-yearterm. They also unanimously ratified a peace accord that wasbrokered by the Arab League at a special Parliament meeting lastmonth in Taif, Saudi Arabia.   The accord is aimed at ending a 14-year civil war that has tornapart this country.   The lawmakers met outside the range of the guns of Christianarmy commander Gen. Michel Aoun, who threatened to shell Parliamentwhen it initially planned to meet in Beirut on Saturday to ratifythe accord.   The peace plan shifts political power to the Moslem majorityfrom the Christians, who were believed to be in the majority whenthe existing political system was devised in the 1940s. Aounopposes the accord because it has no fixed schedule for a totalwithdrawal of the estimated 40,000 Syrian troops backing Moslemforces.   Husseini flew into Kleiat from Paris with 29 mostly Christiandeputies who had been staying in the French capital to avoid Aoun'swrath. They linked up with 26 mostly Moslem legislators who droveSaturday from Beirut, 60 miles to the south, and a 27th who flew infrom Geneva Sunday.   The country has not had a head of state since President AminGemayel's 6-year term expired Sept. 22, 1988, because Parliamentcould not agree on a successor.   Aoun, who heads an interim military Cabinet vying for power witha rival Syrian-backed Moslem government led by Salim Hoss, brandedthe legislators approval of the peace accord last month in theSaudi Arabian resort of Taif ``a breach of the constitution.''   The general considers the Syrians, who control 70 percent ofLebanon, an occupying army and fought them for six months until aSept. 22 cease-fire called by the Arab League took hold.   By police count, 930 people were killed and 2,744 wounded, mostof them civilians, in fierce artillery battles.   The Taif accord increased the size of Parliament from thecurrent 99 seats _54 Christian and 45 Moslem _ to 108, to be evenlydistributed between both sides, and stripped the president of theauthority to appoint and dismiss prime ministers.   But the agreement left the presidency with the Maronites, thedominant Christian sect, as it has been under an unwritten covenantdating from independence from France in 1943.</TEXT></DOC>
