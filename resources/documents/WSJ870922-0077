The review follows reports in this newspaper last month of a major rift between the New York office's chief, Kathleen A. Warwick, and her staff. The reported rift had been aggravated by the tabling by Ms. Warwick of a major insider-trading investigation growing out of the so-called Yuppie Five case, according to New York staffers.    The review, however, already seems to have had an impact on the once-tabled insider trading investigation, according to lawyers familiar with the case. They say that SEC attorneys recently reopened discussions with private attorneys representing figures in the probe linked to the Yuppie Five case. In the Yuppie Five case, the SEC's New York office broke up a ring that included young lawyers and investment bankers.    Several current and former SEC attorneys and investigators have said there is widespread demoralization in the office, the agency's most important post outside Washington. As previously reported, the most visible casualty of the morale problems was Anne Flannery, the office's enforcement chief, who resigned to enter private practice after reportedly clashing over policy matters with Ms. Warwick.    One person familiar with the SEC review said the officials are looking into &quot;anything and everything&quot; behind events that led to dissension between Ms. Warwick and the New York staff, especially the enforcement division. &quot;They seem to be interested in how people in the office think she's doing,&quot; the person said. &quot;It's a review of the office's total performance.&quot;    Reports of problems in the New York office have also drawn the attention of Sen. William Proxmire, (D., Wis.), who recently wrote to newly appointed SEC Chairman David Ruder expressing concern. Details of the letter weren't available, but Mr. Ruder, replying to Sen. Proxmire, recently outlined plans to review the situation.    &quot;We are satisfied that the SEC is taking care of the situation,&quot; said a person close to Sen. Proxmire.    Ms. Warwick, a former securities counsel for Mobil Corp. who took the SEC job at the beginning of the year, was unavailable for comment. A spokesman for the New York office declined comment, as did an SEC spokeswoman in Washington.    The reopened SEC probe appears to focus on three Wall Street traders: Ronald Yagoda, a senior official of Marcus Schloss and Co.; Victor Teicher, formerly an arbitrager with Edward A. Viner andamp; Co., now running his own firm; and David Simon, a former arbitrager with Spear, Leeds andamp; Kellogg.    The three are among several traders mentioned in depositions by several members of the Yuppie Five, including Andrew Solomon, who worked at Marcus Schloss, persons familiar with the investigation said. As previously reported, Mr. Solomon, who pleaded guilty, said at the time of his plea that other executives at his firm were involved.    Attorneys for Mr. Yagoda and Mr. Teicher declined comment. Neither Mr. Simon nor his attorney could be reached. Last year, in connection with its investigation, the government obtained the phone records of Mr. Teicher, Mr. Simon and Irwin Schloss, president of Marcus Schloss. Mr. Schloss's attorney also declined comment. </TEXT></DOC>
