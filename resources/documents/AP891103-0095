The Sandinista party newspaper Barricada said helicopter troopcarriers were being used to ``persecute the criminals'' in LaPinuela and La Cusuca, 170 miles east of here.   Defense Ministry sources who spoke on condition of anonymitysaid the army was fighting bands of Contras in the mountains thatrun from the northern border with Honduras to the southeast.   ``We still don't have any information about the results of thefighting nor about the number of casualties,'' said one source.   The fighting began soon after President Daniel Ortega announcedWednesday that he was ending a 19-month truce.   A Defense Ministry communique said Thursday that three rebelswere killed in El Guapote, 120 miles northeast of the capital inMatagalpa province.   Fighting in two places in Jinotega _ Pantasma and Plan de Grama_ wounded seven government soldiers, the ministry said.   Government troops in three northern provinces, Nueva Segovia,Madriz and Esteli, were reorganizing, Radio Sandino said.   ``The (government) troops began to disperse and restructure thecommands, which went to experienced fighters,'' it said.   Ortega cited infiltration by 1,100 rebels from Honduran camps inthe past three weeks as a reason for ending the truce.   Radio Sandino said Thursday that 400 rebels had worked their wayback into the country in the Quilali area and two other northernzones and were ``assassinating and kidnapping civilians and makingpropaganda for the rightist Unified National Opposition coalition.''   The coalition encompasses parties from both the left and rightand is Ortega's main opposition in presidential elections scheduledFeb. 25, 1990.   In Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Contra commander Enrique Bermudez saidthe rebels would continue observing the cease-fire. Since U.S.weapons and ammunition supplies were cut off in February 1988, hesaid, the rebels are not equipped to attack.   ``These troops will only carry out evasive actions,'' he said.   The rebels said Thursday they had accepted in principle aSandinista offer to meet Monday and Tuesday at the United Nationsto discuss demobilization of the rebel army. Roman CatholicCardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo said he had also accepted aninvitation.   Under a peace agreement signed by Ortega and four other CentralAmerican presidents on Aug. 7, the rebels are to disband andrelocate by early December. The Contras never agreed to the plan.   Lt. Col. Rosa Pasos, a military spokeswoman, denied a Honduranaccusation that Nicaraguan troops attacked the border town of LasManos on Monday.   ``Nicaragua does not attack neighboring countries,'' she said.   Honduras reported no casualties in the attack.   A source inside the Sandinista army estimated 4,000 rebelfighters were inside Nicaragua. U.S. sources also estimated thenumber at about 4,000. Bermudez said there were more than 6,000.   When the peace accord was signed, about 12,000 were in theHonduran camps.   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, traveling aboardAir Force One with President Bush on the way to Richmond, Va.,called the U.N. talks ``a positive sign, something we've called forall along.''   ``What we'd like to see is for these positive steps to lead to areinstatement of the cease-fire and to get President Ortega tocreate a climate in Nicaragua for democracy and repatriation,''Fitzwater said.</TEXT></DOC>
