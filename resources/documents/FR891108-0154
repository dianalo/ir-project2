Under this program, subjectto the availability of funds, the Secretary may award competitive researchgrants, for periods not to exceed five years, for the support of researchprojects to further the programs of the Department of Agriculture. Proposalsmay be submitted by any State agricultural experiment station, college,university, other research institution or organization, Federal agency,private organization, corporation, or individual. Proposals from scientistsat non-United States organizations will not be considered for support.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicable Regulations</ITAG>Regulations applicable to this program include the following: (a) the regulationsgoverning the Competitive Research Grants Program, 7 CFR part 3200 (49FR 5570, February 13, 1984, as amended by 50 FR 5499, February 8, 1985),which set forth procedures to be followed when submitting grant proposals,rules governing the evaluation of proposals and the awarding of grants,and regulations relating to the post-award administration of grant projects;and (b) the USDA Uniform Federal Assistance Regulations, 7 CFR part 3015.<ITAG tagnum="84">Specific Research Areas to be Supported in Fiscal Year 1990</ITAG>Standard project grants and a small number of continuation grants willbe awarded to support research in selected areas of the biological sciencesrelated to agriculture and human nutrition.The Competitive Research Grants Program covers the following scientificdisciplines:<ITAG tagnum="25">Plant Science</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Human Nutrition</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Animal Science</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Biotechnology</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Pest Science</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Depletion of Stratospheric Ozone</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Forest Biology</ITAG>The research categories of plant and animal science and human nutritionhave been considered by a number of scientific groups to possess exceptionalopportunity for fundamental scientific discovery and for contributing tothe advancement of agriculture. The major initiative in biotechnology researchthat began in fiscal year 1985 will continue for fiscal year 1990. It isdesigned to provide opportunities to address research problems in all categoriesof agricultural science including plants, animals, trees, insect pests,and microorganisms associated with these biota. It is anticipated thatthis research will advance broadly the Nation's competitive advantage inthe food, feed, fiber, and natural resources processes. In addition, theresearch area of plant responses to the stratospheric ozone depletion whichwas initiated in fiscal year 1989 will continue to be emphasized; however,the scope will be expanded to include studies of plant responses to allenvironmental factors. This is based on the recognition that stratosphericozone depletion is but one of several global changes that will directlyaffect the growing environment for crop and forest species and that thepotential increase in UV-B radiation cannot be studied as an isolated phenomenon.Proposals addressing how plants perceive and respond to various environmentalsignals including UV-B should be submitted to the new Plant Responses tothe Environment program area (6.0). It is anticipated that an additionalarea to be supported in fiscal year 1990 is forest biology. This area inthe past was part of the Competitive Research Grants Program for Forestand Rangeland Renewable Resources that was funded by the USDA Forest Serviceand administered by CRGO from fiscal years 1985 through 1988. Consistentwith the other program areas, the forest biology component will emphasizebasic biological research related to forest species and forest ecosystems.While basic guidelines are provided to assist members of the scientificcommunity in assessing their interest in the program areas and to delineatecertain important areas where new information is vitally needed, the guidelinesare not meant to provide boundaries or to detract from the creativity ofpotential applicants. USDA encourages the submission of innovative projectsin the so-called ``high-risk'' category as well as those that may havea more certain payoff potential. In all instances, innovative researchwill be given high priority.Agriculturally important organism(s) should be used to accomplish the researchobjectives. The use of other organisms as experimental model systems mustbe justified relative to the goals of the appropriate research programarea and to the long-term objectives of USDA.Workshops or symposia that bring together scientists to identify researchneeds, update information, or advance an area of research are recognizedas integral parts of research efforts. Support for a limited number ofsuch meetings covering subject matter encompassed by this Competitive ResearchGrants solicitation will be considered for partial or, if modest, totalsupport. Proposals for workshops and symposia should be submitted to appropriateprogram areas listed below. Applicants considering submission under thiscategory are strongly advised to consult the appropriate CRGO staff priorto the preparation of a proposal.<T3>Individual Postdoctoral Research Awards:</T3> USDA encourages individuals,who (1) have earned the doctoral degree in a biological science or relatedareas after January 1, 1987 or will have earned the degree no later thanJune 5, 1990; (2) are United States citizens; (3) have obtained commitmentsfrom a State agricultural experiment station, college, university, otherresearch institution or organization, Federal agency, private organizationor corporation for the conduct of research; (4) have made prior arrangementsfor research with a scientific advisor at the institution where the researchwill be conducted; and (5) have interests in research that fall withinthe program areas described in this solicitation, to apply for a CompetitiveResearch Grant. We encourage recently graduated scientists specificallyto develop independent research programs of their own, not to merely supplementon-going research of a senior investigator. While such individuals specificallyare encouraged to submit proposals for competitive grants, it must be notedthat no preference is given to such individuals in determining the grantawards. All individuals and eligible entities, whether or not they meetthe above criteria, are welcome to submit proposals and their proposalswill be evaluated objectively under the applicable award criteria. Interestedpotential applicants should contact the appropriate program staff for furtherinformation.The following specific research areas (program areas) and guidelines areprovided as a base from which proposals may be developed:1.0 <T3>Plant Pathology/Weed Science.</T3> This program area will support researchon biotic stress encountered by plants during interaction with other plants,including weeds and pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, mycoplasma-likeorganisms, and fungi. The programmatic goal is to develop fundamental informationleading to new strategies to reduce losses in or costs of plant productioncaused by biotic stress. Proposals should emphasize studies that will enhancebasic knowledge of the biological mechanisms regulating plant stress atthe molecular, cellular, organismal, or populational level. Disciplinaryapproaches to investigate the basis of biological stresses may includebiochemical, genetic, molecular, or quantitative techniques. Multidisciplinaryteam studies are encouraged. The host plant, weed, or pathogen systemsmay be studied separately or as an interactive unit. Proposals should indicatehow the anticipated results will further our understanding of cause, consequence,or mechanism of stress avoidance in plants. The research supported in thisprogram area will focus on the identification of novel strategies thatare both effective and compatible with social and environmental concerns.2.0 <T3>Plant Genetic Mechanisms and Plant Molecular Biology.</T3> The goalof this program area is to encourage new approaches for the developmentof genetically superior varieties of agricultural crops. One of the majorlimiting factors for the application of biotechnology to agriculture isthe lack of basic information about genes. Studies addressing the basiccellular, molecular, and genetic processes which contribute new informationrequired for the development of novel approaches to crop improvement willbe given high priority. This program area will emphasize the followingbut will not exclude other new or unusual approaches to crop improvement:(a) Identification, isolation, and characterization of genes and gene products;(b) relationships between gene structure and function; (c) regulatory mechanismsof gene expression; (d) interactions between nuclear and organellar genes,and between extrachromosomal and chromosomal genes; (e) mechanisms of generecombination and transportation; (f) molecular basis of chromosomal replication;(g) cell and tissue culture studies designed to increase our knowledgeof the basic molecular, biochemical, and cellular processes involved inregenerating whole plants from single cells; (h) development of cellularand molecular methods for identifying plant characteristics or genes whichare important targets for genetic manipulation; (i) development of molecularand cellular methods for crop improvement that involve gene transfer orgenetic engineering technology; (j) development of new methods for producing,selecting, and transferring agronomically important qualitative and quantitativetraits; and (k) basic genetic studies on the alteration and utilizationof unadapted and wild germplasm.3.0 <T3>Biological Nitrogen Fixation and Metabolism.</T3> The most common limitingnutrient for plant growth is nitrogen. The objective of this program isto support research which will elucidate basic mechanisms of the many processesaffecting the nitrogen status of crop plants, including biological nitrogenfixation, uptake, transport and metabolism of nitrogenous compounds. Innovativeanswers to problems in these areas are sought from disciplines of biochemistry,molecular biology and biotechnology, cellular and developmental biology,microbiology, genetics, physiology and ecology. These areas include, butare not necessarily limited to, studies on (a) the properties, mechanisms,and contributions to nitrogen fixation in both free-living and symbioticnitrogen-fixing organisms; (b) molecular and developmental mechanisms andregulation of infection and nodulation of the root by symbiotic nitrogen-fixingorganisms; (c) factors controlling symbiont specificity; (d) competitiveinteractions of nitrogen fixing organisms with other soil organisms; (e)structural mechanisms and regulatory enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism,including nitrogen fixation and its utilization; (f) nitrification anddenitrification; (g) factors influencing uptake and mechanisms of uptakeof nitrogenous compounds; and (h) metabolic studies on processes affectingthe nitrogen status of the plant.4.0 <T3>Photosynthesis.</T3> Photosynthetic efficiency is an important factorin crop productivity. Basic research that provides information on limitingprocesses of photosynthesis and associated carbon metabolism will leadto a greater understanding of those factors that affect the ability ofthe plant to produce a usable product. Research is needed on (a) geneticand cellular manipulation to improve photosynthetic efficiency in plants,including studies of the chloroplast and nuclear genomes, analyses of regulatorysteps controlling both nuclear and extranuclear photosynthetic gene expressionand their interations; (b) aspects of photosynthetic energy conversion,including such areas as early events in photon capture by photosyntheticsystems and the mechanisms of charge separation, the structure and functionof photosynthetic membranes and membrane constitutents, and the associatedchemical and physical reactions; (c) photosynthetic carbon assimilationincluding mechanisms of CO<T2>2</T2> fixation, biochemistry and molecular biology of photosyntheticand related biosynthetic pathways, photorespiration, and aspects of cellularmetabolism regulating these reactions; (d) control of photosynthate partitioning,translocation, and utilization; (e) development senescence of the photosyntheticapparatus; and (f) photosynthetic process in leaves, whole plants, andconopies including, but not limited to, involvement of the stomatal apparatus.Other research designed to generate new information leading to a basicunderstanding of photosynthesis and its accompanying processes also maybe considered a part of this program area.5.0 <T3> Plant Growth and Development. </T3>Suboptimal growth and developmentare limiting factors in plant productivity. A basic understanding of developmentalprocesses in agriculturally important plants is largely lacking, but newexperimental approaches are being developed through advances in molecularand cellular biology. The goal of this program area is to fill the gapin our knowledge concerning the fundamental mechanisms that underlie plantgrowth and development, emphasizing, but not being limited to, (a) mechanismscontrolling plant growth and development including flowering, fertilization,embryogenesis, germinations, differentiation, organogenesis, and senescence;(b) developmental regulation of gene expression; (c) photomorphogenesis;(d) cell biology including membrane biology; and (e) biochemistry of cellularmetabolism related to plant growth and development. Proposals emphasizingthe use of emerging experimental techniques for the investigation of thesedevelopmental processes are encouraged.6.0 <T3>Plant Responses to the Environment. </T3>This program area combines(and expands upon) two fiscal year 1989 areas, i.e., plant responses toenvironmental stresses and stratospheric ozone depletion. It has becomeclear that the depletion of stratospheric ozone is only one of severalserious environmental problems this Nation's agriculture will be facingfor the near future. It also has become clear that we lack a basic understandingof how the plant perceives and responds to both normal and adverse environmentalsignals. The goal of this area is to understand the fundamental mechanismsof plant responses to all environmental factors including, water, temperature,light (including UV-B), atmospheric ozone and other greenhouse gases, andsoil nutrients. Studies at the whole plant, cellular, biochemical, andmolecular levels will be considered as long as they address basic mechanisms(rather than simply describing the phenomenon). Interactions between plantsand their environment under normal as well as stressed conditions willbe considered as part of this expanded program area. Examples of researchthat will be emphasized include: (a) Mechanisms of plant perception andresponses to environmental signals, (b) The interactions of multiple environmentalfactors and how they affect the physiological and ecological status ofplants, (c) identification, isolation, and expression of genes regulatedby or involved in plant responses to environmental signals, (d) identificationof biochemical and cellular changes that take place in plants in responseto changing environmental signals, and (e) plant nutrition and water relationsas reflected in the physiology and biochemistry of root systems.7.0 <T3>Human Nutrition.</T3> Proposals are invited in the area of human requirementsfor nutrients. This research is intended to contribute to the improvementof human nutritional status by increasing our understanding of requirementsfor nutrients. The objective is to support basic, creative research thatwill help to fill gaps in our knowledge about nutrient requirements, bioavailability,the interrelationships of nutrients, and the nutritional value of foodsthat are consumed in the U.S. and of the nutrient condition of healthyindividuals, as all of these relate to human nutrient requirements. Studiesof the biochemical and molecular basis for nutrient requirements are encouraged,answering questions as to why a particular nutrient is required and whatits function is in the cell. Also, studies of the molecular biology offactors interacting with nutrients, such as receptors, carrier proteinsand binding proteins, are encouraged.Support will not be provided for clinical research, demonstration or actionprojects, nor for surveys of the nutritional status of population groups.In addition, the use of animals as model systems must be justified.Proposals dealing with processing techniques in food technology shouldbe clearly oriented toward determining human nutrient requirements. Proposalsthat concern utilization or production of a food commodity should emphasizethe relationship to specific human nutrient requirements. It is especiallyimportant that proposals emphasize innovative, fundamental research.8.0 <T3>Animal Science (Reproductive Physiology)</T3>. Suboptimal reproductiveperformance in domestic farm animals is the major factor limiting moreefficient production of animal food products. This failure to achieve maximalreproductive efficiency is due to problems related to puberty, ovulation,corpus luteum formation and function, insemination, fertilization, prenataldeath, and poor survival of offspring.Economic loss to the producer and increased costs of animal food productsto the consumer due to inefficient reproductive performance make the requirementfor new knowledge in this area a high priority. Although the exact needsmay vary from species to species and region to region, there are areaswhere additional fundamental research is crucial.This program area will support innovative basic research on: (a) Mechanismsaffecting embryo survival, endocrinological control of embryo development,mechanisms of embryo-maternal interactions, and embryo implantation; (b)factors controlling ovarian function including follicular development,corpus luteum formation and function, and ovulation; (c) gamete physiology,including oogenesis and spermatogenesis, gamete maturation, mechanismsregulating gamete survival <T3>in vivo</T3> and <T3>in vitro,</T3> the fundamental processes of fertilization and basicquestions regarding gamete transport; (d) parturition, postpartum intervalto conception, and neonatal survival.This program area also encourages basic research on the mechanisms controllinganimal responses to physical and biological stresses that impinge uponreproductive efficiency. Research should address the cellular and molecularbasis for the organism's interaction with these stresses and should contributeto an understanding of the causes, consequences, and avoidance of stress,rather than merely describing the physiological effects of stress on reproductiveefficiency.Emphasis should be given to innovative approaches that may contribute toa thorough understanding of the reproductive processes in animals primarilyraised for food and fiber production or that otherwise contribute to theagricultural enterprise of the country. The use of experimental model systemsshould be justified relative to the objectives of this research area.9.0 <T3>Animal Molecular Biology and Brucellosis.</T3> A major limiting factorin the use of biotechnology in agriculture is the lack of basic informationabout genes and gene products. The primary objective of this program areais to increase our understanding of the structure, organization, function,regulation, and expression of genes in agriculturally important animalsand in their associated infectious agents.The following categories of research should be emphasized: (a) Identification,isolation, characterization of genes and gene products; (b) relationshipsbetween gene structure and function; (c) regulatory mechanisms of geneexpression; (d) interactions between nuclear and mitochondrial genes andbetween extrachromosomal and chromosomal genes; (e) mechanisms of generecombination and transposition; (f) modecular basis of chromosomal replication;and (g) mechanisms of interaction of animals with deleterious microorganismsor infections agents. The use of experimental model systems should be suitablyjustified relative to the program objectives. Proposals involving vaccineand reagent development <T3>per se</T3> will not be considered for support. In addition, proposalsinvolving free-living insects that are not intermediate hosts and vectorsof animal diseases will not be considered.This program area will also support research on the molecular, cellular,and genetic levels that will (a) define the mechanisms by which <T3>Brucella abortus</T3> induces disease in cattle and persists as aninfectious agent and (b) define the basis of the bovine immune responsewith <T3>B. abortus</T3> that results in protective immunity. Proposals alsoare encouraged which, through molecular biological techniques, identifyand produce (c) antigens to differentiate among non-infected, vaccinated,and the <T3>B. abortus-</T3> infected cattle and (d) immunogens that stimulatelong-lived protective immunity in cattle.10.0 <T3>Animal Growth and Development.</T3> Suboptimal growth and developmentare limiting factors in animal productivity, yet a basic understandingof the developmental processes in agriculturally important animals is largelylacking. New experimental approaches are being developed through advancesin molecular and cellular biology. The goal of this program area is a basicunderstanding of the development processes in agriculturally importantanimals as well as to increase fundamental knowledge that will providea basis for biotechnological manipulation of animal growth and development.This research area will place emphasis on, but not be limited to, studiesof: (a) Cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling growth and developmentprocesses, including growth factors and differentiation; (b)_ molecularand cellular biological studies of metabolic processes related to growthand development including muscling and rumen development; and (c) identificationof molecular and cellular targets for genome manipulation, including transgenics.The use of experimental model systems should be suitably justified relativeto the program objectives.Proposals dealing essentially with aspects of reproduction should be submittedto the Animal Science (Reproductive Physiology) program area (8.0). Proposalsaddressing research on infectious agents (bacteria, fungi, parasites, andviruses) of animals should be sent to the Animal Molecular Biology andBrucellosis area (9.0).11.0 <T3>Plant Pest Science_Insects and Nematodes. </T3>Uncontrolled invertebratepests are a major factor in reducing crop and forest productivity. Beforesuccessful strategies for managing these pests can be developed, a strongbasic biology research effort is needed particularly to divulge the intricateinteractions between the pest and its plant hosts. It is clear that anunderstanding of plant/insect or plant/nematode interactions also willbe dependent on an in depth understanding of how these pests function onthe most basic levels.Within this context, the goal of this research area is to understand basicconcepts of plant/insect or plant/nematode interactions including: (a)How interactions are established; (b) biochemical, physiological, and molecularplant responses to attack; (c) pest responses to plant defenses; and (d)the genetics of these interactions. Studies which emphasize how damagefrom insects and nematodes can be reduced, including basic studies on biologicalcontrol organisms, also will be supported. Basic studies on insect or nematodepests away from the host plant may be proposed in the following areas:(a) behavioral physiology, (b) chemical ecology, (c) endocrinology, (d)population dynamics, (e) genetics, (f) behavioral ecology, (g) pathogens,parasites and predators, and (h) toxicology including basic pesticide resistancestudies. In all cases, however, proposals should indicate how the anticipatedinformation will be relevant to our understanding of plant/insect interactionsand a reduction of plant stresses caused by these organisms. Research onthe molecular, cellular, or organismal level will be considered.Proposals are invited in either of the following sub areas: <T3>Pest Science: </T3>Proposals dealing with bollworm, bollweevil, gypsymoth or pine bark beetle. <T3>Entomology/Nematology: </T3>Proposals dealing with insect or nematodepests not listed above (includes mites). Availability of funds will determine whether proposals in each sub areaare to be evaluated by separate peer review panels. 12.0 <T3>Alcohol Fuels Research. </T3>Proposals will be considered for researchrelating to the physiological, microbiological, biochemical, and geneticprocesses controlling the biological coversion of agriculturally importantbiomass material to alcohol fuels and industrial hydrocarbons. The scopeof this program area includes studies on factors that limit efficiencyof biological production of alcohol fuels and the means for overcomingthese limitations. 14.0 <T3>Forest Biology. </T3>The major aim of this area of research is to examinefundamental aspects of plant science that are unique to forest trees. Importantobjectives include: (a) Research on physiology and biochemistry of foresttree species that are designed to elucidate the target process for futurebiotechnological manipulations of trees, (b) the identification and utilizationof genes that control mechanisms for resistance to pests and pathogensof our major tree species, (c) fundamental genetics of forest tree species,and (d) cell and developmental biology, and (e) responses to environmentalfactors such as nutrients, water, temperatures and UV-B. In addition thisarea will focus on ecological aspects of forest tree communities, particularlyon the interactions of trees with herbaceous plants that are highly competitiveand thus affect production and normal forest succession. Basic researchon wood chemistry, the biochemistry of lignification and cellulosic materials,and the process of lignin degradation by wood-rotting and other organismswill also be considered in this program. The submission deadline for thiscategory is listed below. To provide adequate scientific evaluation ofproposals that are expected to be diverse, proposals submitted under thiscategory will be reviewed by the peer review panel whose collective expertiseis most appropriate to the scientific content of each proposal. Upon receiptof a proposal, the staff of the Competitive Research Grants office willassign it to one of nine plant science peer review panels for scientificreview. <T3>Soybean Research. </T3>Proposals dealing with fundamental researchon soybeans should emphasize research objectives that fit the scientificdisciplines of the appropriate program areas noted above. Soybean proposalswill be reviewed and evaluated by the peer panel whose collective expertiseis most appropriate to the scientific content of the proposal under consideration.A separate peer review panel will not be assembled for the purpose of reviewingsoybean proposals. <ITAG tagnum="84">How to Obtain Application Materials. </ITAG>Please note that potential applicants who are on the Competitive ResearchGrants mailing list, who sent applications in fiscal year 1989, or whorecently requested placement on the list for fiscal year 1990, will automaticallyreceive copies of this solicitation, the Grant Application Kit, and theregulations governing the Competitive Research Grants Program, 7 CFR part3200 (49 FR 5570, February 13, 1984, as amended).
